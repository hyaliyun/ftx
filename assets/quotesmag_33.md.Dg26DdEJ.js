Other visual research projects included the direction of a 1995 collaboration involving five other artists (collectively known as Ship of Fools) using the subject of mythologies to explore the full range of narrative and visual interfaces in interactive media in a piece called Labyrinth. This work involved drama, digital image, virtual environments, and interactive video at F-Stop Gallery in Bath and as part of the Cheltenham Literary Festival. It has been previewed at a number of venues including the Oberhausen Short Film festival in Germany and at ISEA in Montreal.

He served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War, in which he was wounded three times. After the war Jackson operated a mine. Early life and career Nathaniel J. Jackson was born in the coastal town of Newburyport located in Essex County, Massachusetts. When he was young he was taught \\"the machinist's trade\\" and by 1861 he was superintendent of the Hill mill in Lewiston, Maine. Jackson also was active in the Maine State Militia, and would command some of those militiamen early in the American Civil War during his first two commands.Warner, p. 248. Civil War service In 1861 Jackson chose to follow the Union cause. He was appointed commander of the 1st Maine Infantry Regiment on May 3, with the rank of colonel. The 1st Maine did not participate in the opening campaigns of the Civil War, and the 90-day regiment as well as Jackson were mustered out of the volunteer service in early August.Warner, p. 248; Eicher, p. 316. 1st Maine mustered out on August 3, 1861, and Jackson two days later. Jackson re-entered the Union Army on September 3, 1861, as colonel of the 5th Maine Infantry. This regiment enlisted for 3 years service, and Jackson's appointment to command it was not popular. His assignment was announced on September 9, \\"which led to a near mutiny in the regiment. Several officers resigned and General Henry W. Slocum had to act swiftly to prevent further mutinous acts by the members of the 5th Maine.\\" Jackson and the 5th then participated in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. He fought during the Battle of Gaines' Mill on June 27, where Jackson was wounded in his right elbow.Eicher, p. 316. His regiment lost 10 killed, 69 wounded, and another 16 men missing in the battle. Upon recovering, Jackson participated in the 1862 Maryland Campaign. He fought at the Battle of Crampton's Gap on September 14, and was present Battle of Antietam three days later.Warner, p. 249. On September 19 Jackson was wounded in his knee in fighting again at Crampton's Gap. On September 23 at his camp near Williamsport, Maryland, Jackson submitted his official report concerning the battle on September 14, saying: Jackson after his 1862 promotion to brigadier general Jackson was promoted to brigadier general on September 24, 1862, and given brigade command in the XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac that October. His brigade and the XII Corps was stationed at Harper's Ferry during the Battle of Fredericksburg in December. Jackson was seriously wounded on April 17, 1863, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, when his horse slipped and Jackson fractured his right thigh. The injury prevented him from participating in the Battle of Chancellorsville that May and he was out of action until the fall. When Jackson was fit enough for light duty, he was given command of the Draft Depot in New York Harbor located on Rikers Island, and then on Hart's Island, posts he held for over a year. On November 11, 1864, Jackson was ordered to the Western Theater and given temporary command of a division of XX Corps in the Army of Georgia. He led it during Sherman's March to the Sea in November and December 1864, in which Jackson was wounded when he was shot just above his right ankle. In 1865 he continued to lead his division in the Carolinas Campaign until April 2, fighting at the Battle of Bentonville. Jackson was brevetted to the rank of major general in the Union Army on March 15, due to his conduct at Battle of Gaines' Mill nearly three years prior. Postbellum Jackson was mustered out of the volunteer service on August 24, 1865, and returned to civilian life. By 1870 he had left Lewiston, Maine, and also worked as a coal mine operator after the war. Jackson died in the spring of 1892 in Jamestown, New York, at the home of one of his sons. His body was returned to Massachusetts and buried there in Newburyport. It was noted that neither of the local newspapers in Jamestown or Buffalo, the nearest major city, reported on Jackson's death.Warner, p. 249; Eicher, p. 316.

He was a list MP from the 2008 election until the 2011 election and again from February to May 2013. Early years Gilmore was born in Christchurch to shopkeeper parents and attended Parkview Primary School, in the Christchurch suburb of Parklands. He attended Shirley Boys' High School, before attending the University of Canterbury where he gained a Master of Commerce degree in Economics in 1995. Gilmore began his career working as an analyst with the Ministry of Transport in Wellington in 1995. The following year he began working at the Department of Treasury at the Crown Companies Monitoring Advisory Unit as an advisor on state owned enterprise privatisation. In 1997 Gilmore worked on secondment to SOE Minister Tony Ryall, where he advised on the sale of state owned enterprises. Gilmore left the public service in 1999 to join Ernst and Young, where he worked on international projects advising utility companies. In 2001 he joined Cameron and Partners in a similar role before returning to Ernst and Young in Christchurch as a senior manager in 2004. In 2005 Gilmore worked as Corporate Development Manager at General Cable, until selection as a National Party candidate. Member of Parliament Gilmore was selected by the National Party Christchurch East local electorate as its candidate in the safe Labour seat of Christchurch East at the end of 2007. In August 2008 the National Party announced that he would be placed at number 56 on the National Party list. Gilmore came second in the electorate race, losing to the incumbent, Lianne Dalziel, by 5,765 votes, but achieved a record for National in the area of over 12,000 party and personal votes. Gilmore's curriculum vitae posted on the Parliament web page until 2010 listed him as a member of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute, a position he never had, although he had been a provisional member. He attributed the error to the Parliamentary Service, but a spokesman said \\"biographical information about MPs published on its website was supplied by them and approved by them as correct\\". The same online CV by Parliamentary Services contained other inaccuracies, including that Gilmore was married at the time. In the , he again contested Christchurch East and was 53rd on the party list. He again placed second in the electorate behind Dalziel, and on election night results was set to be returned to parliament via the list, the last-placed candidate to be returned. However, with the counting of special votes and the release of official results, National lost a seat to the Green Party so Gilmore was not returned. In 2013, as the next list MP, he returned to Parliament to replace Lockwood Smith, who had been appointed as High Commissioner of New Zealand to the United Kingdom. Emails were released under the Official Information Act in May 2013 from his time as a contractor to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) in November 2012, just prior to his return to Parliament in 2013.OIA emails The emails contained comments to a Treasury Manager during an argument in which Gilmore said, after noting he may be returning to Parliament as a government member, \\"I am sure this sort of thing will come back to haunt you if you want your career to reach its full potential.\\" The emails were described as \\"inappropriate\\" by the Ministry and the Ministry. TV3 had asked Gilmore specifically, in a previously broadcast segment, whether there had been any complaints about his time at MBIE, and Gilmore had replied on camera that there was nothing that had been brought to his attention. Departure from Parliament Gilmore announced his resignation from Parliament on 12 May 2013, following a public scandal involving a restaurant in Hanmer Springs, in which it is \\"alleged Gilmore asked the barman (who had declined to sell him more alcohol) 'Do you know who I am?' and threatened to have Prime Minister John Key intervene to have him sacked.\\" Gilmore's resignation followed pressure from senior Ministers and the revelation that he had misled the Prime Minister.accusations against Aarron Gilmore He gave his valedictory speech two days later.Aaron Gilmore resigns from Parliament 3news.co.nz, 12 May 2013 His membership of Parliament ceased on 27 May, and his committee memberships (Maori Affairs, and Local Government and Environment) a day later.

For example, it can read sequential files based on the input format specified, then look up certain fields in a VSAM file or in another sequential file. SAFR can produce output in yet another format with some additional calculations, as required. The entire process is called a VIEW, and any number of VIEWs can be defined. SAFR also commonly processes data from other platforms that are fed into its engine. IBM markets and sells SAFR through its IBM Global Services division, typically with customer-specific services. The product solves business intelligence problems for large operational databases, especially in insurance and financial industries. It traces its roots to a technology called GenevaERS, created by PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting as part of their practice. (IBM acquired PwC Consulting in 2002.) SAFR is also popular among SAP users, including manufacturing companies, with large databases and significant reporting needs. (Despite its name, SAFR is not confined to financial industry roles.)

Primarily, there are two types of scouts: player scouts and tactical scouts. Player scouts or physical scouts evaluate the talent of footballers with a view to signing them on a professional contract for their employers. Some scouts focus on discovering promising young players and future stars, others are employed to run the rule on potential signings. While smaller clubs might only scout within their own country or region, larger, richer clubs can have extensive international scouting networks. Tactical scouts assess the matches of upcoming opponents of the club and prepare dossiers for their teams' tactical preparations. Instead of identifying talent in these matches, the scout assesses the team and each individual player to identify the relative tactical threats and weaknesses in the opposition. Tactical scouts are typically full-time employees of clubs as their knowledge and findings are considered precious to clubs. However, relatively few football scouts are employed full-time, even in the largest professional clubs. By and large, their numbers are made up by talent scouts, BBC Sport interview with former Chelsea scout Gwyn Williams the vast majority of which work part-time, and a club may hire several hundred - it has been reported, for example, that the Spanish Primera Liga team Sevilla FC has a global scouting network of about 700 player scouts. Passing mention of the scouting team from Juande Ramos' old club Sevilla FC Not all scouts are actually employed by football clubs. For example, the makers of the Football Manager computer game have their own international network of scouts, and in 2008 signed an exclusive deal with Premier League side Everton to provide early access to their database of statistics and ratings. Finding players  A player scout typically attends as many football matches as possible to evaluate targets first hand. Scouts who wish to identify promising young players typically attend lower-league club games, where their talent can be compared to older peers, or under-16, 18 and 21 international tournaments. Scouts may also receive tips from agents, peers and club colleagues. During 2010s, it has become quite common to use online tools like Wyscout to find football players. Evaluating players On the first evaluation, player scouts determine whether a player has the desired technical attributes to succeed at the sport. They then highlight this player to the club management. Some of the desired attributes that scouts look in players include: * Goalkeepers: good reflexes, communication with defence, one-on-one ability, command of the penalty area and aerial intelligence. Scouting report on the Birmingham City goalkeeper evaluates based on these attributes. * Centre- backs: good heading and tackling ability, height, bravery in attempting challenges, concentration. Scouting report on the Sheffield Wednesday centre back evaluates based on these attributes. * Full-backs: pace, stamina, anticipation, tackling and marking abilities, work rate and team responsibility. Scouting report on the Sheffield United full back based on these attributes. * Central midfielders: stamina, passing ability, team responsibility, positioning, marking abilities. Scouting report on the Crystal Palace central midfielder based on these attributes. * Wingers: pace, technical ability like dribbling and close control, off-the-ball intelligence, creativity. Scouting report on the Wolverhampton Wanderers winger based on these attributes. * Forwards: finishing ability, composure, technical ability, heading ability, pace, off-the-ball intelligence. Scouting report on the Wolverhampton Wanderers forward based on these attributes. Once a player has been recommended to a club, the club may continue to monitor his progress over a period from as little as a few months to as many as a few seasons. Scouts continue to evaluate whether a player has turned in consistent performances, if he has retained his appetite for team responsibilities, and so on. When the club is satisfied that a player fits the requirements of the club, the club may extend the invitation to the player to attend a trial at the club, where scouts and coaching staff evaluate the player's suitability for the club in terms of his personality and training attitude. Clubs also tend to perform background checks on the player. A trial at the club allows the club to evaluate the standard of the player against players already on its roster. However, in the top leagues, players are typically not allowed to leave training to undertake trials unless they are already out of contract and need to prove their fitness and ability to any clubs interested. Smaller clubs in need of the cash for transfers may also be more amenable to allowing their players to leave on trials. Once the player has passed these evaluations, the club then starts negotiations with a view to a transfer, either a permanent transfer, a loan, or co-ownership (as is common in the Italian leagues).  Tactical scouting  Tactical scouts watch the games of a club's upcoming opponents to assess their overall ability, as well as their specific threats and weaknesses. Almost every major club side in the world, including Chelsea FC, Details Jos√© Mourinho's coaching and tactical assessment methods while at Chelsea. is known to employ the extensive services of tactical scouts. From these assessments, tactical scouts compile dossiers with recommendations to club coaches and players on their actions on-field. In major clubs, it is typical for scouts to assemble specific reports and DVDs on specific opponent players. These DVDs and reports are watched, read and reviewed by players a few days before the game. Nearer towards the game, it is typical for coaches to convene meetings to summarise the findings of these reports and the approach recommended to the players. More specifically, tactical scouts: * Offer advice on the team's general approach, for example, if the opposition team should be attacked with sustained pressure or to invite them onto the attack and strike on the counter. The scout also assesses the team's general passing pattern and playing tempo. * Identify the opposition's key threats and ways which they can be dealt with. For instance, a right winger who is very weak with his left foot may be marked in such a manner as to force him infield towards his weaker side. Details Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann's notes on Argentina's spot kick takers. In the event Lehmann saved two penalties to win the shootout. * Highlight the opposition's key weaknesses, particularly weaknesses in strength, pace, stamina and concentration that can be exploited by the team's strengths. Football coach \\"Matt\\" explains the general principles of tactical scouting. * Wingers are assessed according to which parts of the field they cut in towards goal or cut out to stay wide, and their preferred moves. * Penalty kick takers are assessed according to which sides and corners they prefer aiming their kicks at. Famously, a scribbled scouting report on penalty kick takers aided Jens Lehmann's Germany to a victory over Argentina in a penalty shootout during the World Cup 2006 quarter-final. This Mirror article reports on a leaked tactical scouting report by Jos√© Mourinho's Chelsea on Newcastle United. * Identify the opposition team's favoured attack set piece movements, as well as their deficiencies when defending set pieces. Tactical Scouting also involves the use of technology and analytics to assess movements of footballers both on and off the ball. Football itself has many variables which specific technologies can home in on and bring out. And as a result, clubs can even go as far as drawing up shortlists of desired players whose statistics match that of their desired objectives, all without the scout even leaving his/her training ground. Scout can gather the data, watch footage and save money on travelling the world to find talent. Importance of scouting With the modernisation and globalisation of football and the football club economy, scouting has grown in stature and importance. Competition to search for young talents is extremely keen. Although it is difficult to quantify the prevalence of scouting in modern football, circumstantial evidence of its magnitude is readily available. The former Chelsea FC Chief Scout Gwyn Williams is reported to have used a database containing up to 77,000 players while working there. It has also been reported that home games of the French second division club Tours FC are attended by an average of 15 to 20 scouts per game. Interview with Arsene Wenger over the scouting of young players The importance of scouting offers football clubs with several distinct advantages: * Global reach. Scouting allows clubs to cast the largest possible net to find players from all around the world. * Cheap players. Players from lower leagues can be available at cheaper transfer prices, and command smaller wages. In particular, a talented cheap player can help a football club to progress in a league, knockout cup competition, or into continental cup competition, potentially even ahead of other clubs with superior financial clout. * Specialist tactical advice. Scouting opposition matches allows clubs to build up a knowledge base about opponents that club coaches would otherwise not have the time and resources to research on their own.  Professional Football Scouts Association  The Professional sports Football Scouts Association (PFSA) was formed in 2013 by 2 elite Premier League Football Scouts and is the only known representation for football scouts in the UK. They provide 4 scouting courses including Talent Identification in Football and Advanced Reporting at Hotel Football, Old Trafford. Notable testimonials for the PFSA are Ryan Giggs, Shaun Goater, David Dunn and many heads of recruitment and talent identification professionals within the Premier and Football League. The PFSA currently help supply the Northern Premier League with a complimentary scouting network, providing newly qualified members the opportunity to provided detailed reports to all 68 clubs.

He was the Liberal Democrat candidate for the constituency of Poplar and Limehouse in the 2010 general election. As Chairman of the London Liberal Democrats, he supervised the headquarters' move to Brixton and streamlined its operations. Early life Fryer was born in Manchester on 5 June 1950, under the name Graham Leslie Morton. Following the divorce of his natural mother, he was adopted as an infant by a local businessman and his father's wife, who later spent much of their time in South Africa. He has two natural sisters and one adopted one. Education Manchester Grammar School After private primary education at Branwood School, Eccles, Fryer obtained a place at the independent Manchester Grammar School. He spent the summer of 1967 in Tours, at the Institut de Touraine, perfecting his French. He left school before the end of his final year (having acquired 'A' levels in English Literature, French and Geography) and travelled overland to Vietnam, where he reported on the war for the Manchester Evening News and the Geographical Magazine. His overland journey back to England in September 1969 gave him his first introduction to the Middle East, which has remained an abiding interest. Fryer had won an Open Exhibition award to St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he started to read Geography, before switching to Oriental Studies (Chinese with Japanese). He returned to the Far East for a year in 1971‚Äì1972, studying part- time at the University of Hong Kong and in Tokyo. As a mature student, he has been working on an MSc in Development and Environmental Education. Career Fryer joined Reuters news agency as a graduate trainee after university, serving for just over a year in London and Brussels. On receiving his first book contract (for The Great Wall of China) he went freelance, but kept Brussels as his base for seven years, travelling widely in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. He returned to England in 1981, settling in London, largely to develop his political interests. As a freelance writer on international affairs, he has worked mainly for the BBC (Radio 4 and World Service), but has also contributed to the Guardian, Independent, Economist, Spectator, Oldie, Tablet, Society Today and Liberal, amongst others. For a decade, he regularly appeared on the Today Programme's 'Thought for the Day', as a Quaker (having joined the Religious Society of Friends after his experiences in Vietnam), but in recent years has become better known for his despatches in From Our Own Correspondent. He has travelled to 160 countries, reporting, researching or making radio documentaries. Since 1993, Fryer has taught part-time at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), currently Humanities, and more recently began teaching at City University (Writing Non- Fiction). He lectures frequently on cruise ships, notably around the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, as well as to groups and associations in the UK. Through the British Council and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, he has given seminars on democracy-building and the media in locations such as Egypt, Ethiopia and Uruguay. He is a Consultant with Public Affairs International (London). Politics Fryer joined the Young Liberals after Jo Grimond came to his school during the 1964 general election. He was successively Vice-Chairman of the North West Young Liberal Federation and Secretary of the Oxford University Liberal Club. He was elected a London borough councillor (in Bromley) 1986‚Äì90, and fought three general elections: Chelsea 1983, Orpington 1987 and Leyton 1992. His main political focus has always been the European Parliament, for which he stood in London South East in the 1979, 1984 and 1994 elections. In the 1999 and 2004 elections he stood on the LibDem list for the London region, coming within 0.6 per cent of winning a seat on the last occasion. He was the No. 2 candidate on the LibDem London list for the European Parliament election in June 2009. He has held a wide variety of positions within the Liberal Democrats and predecessor parties, including chairing policy panels on international development (currently Chairman of the Liberal International British Group), a member of the LibDems' international relations committee, an elected member of the governing Council of the European Liberal Democrats (ELDR) and is on the party's Interim Peers' List. As Chairman of the Liberal International British Group, he is automatically a Vice-President of Liberal International worldwide. He was the Liberal Democrat prospective parliamentary candidate for his home constituency of Poplar and Limehouse in 2010. In the 2019 European Parliament election, he was the fourth candidate on the party's list for the London constituency, in which three Liberal Democrat MEPs were elected.

Jerusalem Theatre at night. The Jerusalem Theatre (, The Jerusalem Centre for the Performing Arts) is a centre for the performing arts in Jerusalem. The theatre opened in 1971. The complex consists of the Sherover Theatre, which seats 950, the Henry Crown Symphony Hall (home of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra) with 750 seats, the Rebecca Crown Auditorium, with 450 seats, and the Little Theatre with 110 seats. Changing art exhibits are held in the main foyer and other spaces in the building, and a restaurant and bookshop operate on the ground floor. History In 1958, the Jerusalem Municipality, headed by Mordechai Ish Shalom, held a design competition for a municipal theatre on a plot of 11 dunams (2.8 acres), on the southern edge of the Talbiya neighborhood. Architects Michael Nadler, Shulamit Nadler and Shmuel Bixson won first prize. The municipality also received a large donation from the Jewish millionaire Miles Sherover, who made his fortune in Venezuela. The cornerstone laying took place in October 1964. Despite plans to complete the building within two years, work progressed slowly due to disputes and budgetary problems. Critics claimed that the city had more pressing problems and predicted that the theatre would be a \\"white elephant.\\" The building was dedicated in October 1971. American millionaire Lester Crown, who had donated $9 million for a new sports stadium, in the Shuafat area that was never built, was persuaded by Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek to change the designation of the donation from sports to arts and culture. The money was used to build the Henry Crown Concert Hall, which seats 750, and the Rebecca Crown Auditorium, which seats 450. The planning and design of the new wing was carried out by the same architectural firm, so that the new wing, named for Crown's parents, was a natural continuation of the original design. Architecture The theatre combines sculptural elements of exposed concrete with traditional Jerusalem stone construction. It sits in a large public square that is used for outdoor concerts and other events.

It was long thought that Rome actually had two different, consecutive sun gods: The first, Sol Indiges, was thought to have been unimportant, disappearing altogether at an early period. Only in the late Roman Empire, scholars argued, did solar cult re-appear with the arrival in Rome of the Syrian Sol Invictus, perhaps under the influence of the Mithraic mysteries. Recent publications have challenged the notion of two different sun gods in Rome, pointing to the abundant evidence for the continuity of the cult of Sol, and the lack of any clear differentiation ‚Äì either in name or depiction ‚Äì between the \\"early\\" and \\"late\\" Roman sun god. Etymology The Latin sol for \\"Sun\\" is believed to originate in the Proto-Indo-European language, as a continuation of the heteroclitic *Seh2ul- / *Sh2-en-, and thus cognate to other solar deities in other Indo-European Languages: Germanic Sol, Sanskrit Surya, Greek Helios, Lithuanian Saulƒó.see e.g. Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, p. 556. Also compare Latin sol to Etruscan usil. Today, sol (or variations of it, such as Italian sole or French soleil) is still the main word for \\"sun\\" in Romance languages. In the Roman Republic According to Roman sources, the worship of Sol was introduced by Titus Tatius shortly after the foundation of Rome.Varro, De Lingua, 5.68.August, de Civ. Dei, iv. 23 In Virgil he is the grandfather of Latinus, the son of Sol's daughter Circe who lived not far from Rome at Monte Circeo.Virgil, Aeneid, 12, 161‚Äì164. A shrine to Sol stood on the banks of the Numicius, near many important shrines of early Latin religion.Pliny, Nat. Hist., III 56. In Rome Sol had an \\"old\\" temple in the Circus Maximus according to Tacitus (56‚Äì117 CE),Tacitus, Annals, 15, 74. and this temple remained important in the first three centuries CE.Tertullian, de Spect, 8. There was also an old shrine for Sol on the Quirinal, where an annual sacrifice was offered to Sol Indiges on August 9 to commemorate Caesar's victory at Pharsala (48 BCE). The Roman ritual calendars or fasti also mention a feast for Sol Indiges on December 11, and a sacrifice for Sol and Luna on August 28\\\\. Traditionally, scholars have considered Sol Indiges to represent an earlier, more agrarian form in which the Roman god Sol was worshipped, and considered him to be very different from the late Roman Sol Invictus, whom they believed was a predominantly Syrian deity. Neither the epithet \\"indiges\\" (which fell out of use sometime after Caesar) nor the epithet \\"invictus\\" are used with any consistency however, making it impossible to differentiate between the two.See the wikipedia article Sol Invictus; see also Di indigetes. Sol Invictus Polychrome reproduction of the Mithraic banquet scene featuring Mithras and the Sun god (Sol Invictus) banqueting on the hide of the slaughtered bull, dating to 130 CE, Lobdengau-Museum, Ladenburg, Germany Sol Invictus (English translated as \\"Unconquered Sun\\") was long thought to have been a foreign state-supported sun god introduced from either Emesa or Palmyra in Syria by the emperor Aurelian in 274 and overshadowing other Eastern cults in importance,A typical example of this line of thought can be found in: until the abolition of classical Roman religion under Theodosius I. However the evidence for this is meager at best, and the notion that Aurelian introduced a new cult of the sun ignores the abundant evidence on coins, in images, in inscriptions, and in other sources for a strong presence of the sun god in Rome throughout the imperial period. Tertullian (died 220 CE) writes that the Circus Maximus was dedicated primarily to Sol.Tertullian, De Spect., 8 During the reign of Aurelian, a new college of pontiffs for Sol was established. There is some debate over the significance of the date December 21 for the cult of Sol. According to a single, late source, the Romans held a festival on December 21 of Dies Natalis Invicti, \\"the birthday of the unconquered one.\\" Most scholars assume Sol Invictus was meant, although our source for this festival does not state so explicitly. December 25 was commonly indicated as the date of the winter solstice, with the first detectable lengthening of daylight hours. There were also festivals on other days in December, including the 11th (mentioned above), as well as August. Gordon points out that none of these other festivals are linked to astronomical events. When the festival on December 25 was instituted is not clear, which makes it hard to assess what impact (if any) it had on the establishment of Christmas. Throughout the 4th century the cult of Sol continued to be maintained by high-ranking pontiffs, including the renowned Vettius Agorius Praetextatus.CIL VI, 1778, and 1779.  Identification with other deities  The Greek assimilation of Apollo and Helios was already established in Rome by the end of the republic. Various Roman philosophers speculated on the nature of the sun, without arriving at any consensus. A typical example is Nigidius, a scholar of the 1st century BCE. His works have not survived, but writing five centuries later, Macrobius reports that Nigidius argued that Sol was to be identified with Janus and that he had a counterpart, Jana, who was Luna. As such, they were to be regarded as the highest of the gods, receiving their sacrifices before all the others. Such speculations appear to have been restricted to an erudite elite and had no impact on the well-attested cult of Sol as independent deity: No ancient source aside from Macrobius mentions the equation of Sol with Janus.

He was first trained by his breeder, Eithne C Holdsworth, in Co. Kilkenny and then by Martin Pipe. He had 18 starts in Ireland with these two trainers, all in Ireland, but did not win any of them. Season 1990-1991 In December 1990, his trainer sent him over hurdles, and on his hurdling debut, Viking Flagship fell at Wolverhampton. In his next start, he finished a head to 2nd Newton Abbot, before going on to complete a four timer in Novice Hurdles between February and April 1991. After this, he changed yards and joined new trainer W M Halley, for whom he had his first start at Punchestown in April 1991, where he finished 6th. That proved to be his only start under the trainer, as he changed yards again in the summer, joining David Nicholson. Season 1991-1992 Viking Flagship began the season finishing down the field in a handicap hurdle at Newton Abbot and followed that up with a 4th place finish in his next 2 starts. After winning a Taunton handicap on his next start, he contested some valuable handicaps for the remainder of the season. He finished placed in the Imperial Cup, County Handicap Hurdle, and Cordon Bleu Handicap at Aintree on his final start of the season. Season 1992-1993 Viking Flagship embarked on a novice chasing campaign and did not reappear until February 1993, where he fell on his first start over fences at the beginning of February. However, he bounced back and completed a hat-trick over fences between the 8th and 25 February. He followed that up with 2 wins within 3 days at the Punchestown Festival. Season 1993-1994 He began with two second-place finishes in handicaps, before he won the Victor Chandler Chase in January and the Game Spirit Chase in February. That was followed with a neck victory in the prestigious Queen Mother Champion Chase. On his final start that season, Viking Flagship finished an 11-length second to Uncle Ernie in the Martell Aintree Chase. Season 1994-1995 He made his seasonal debut in the Tingle Creek Chase, where he was a 3-1/2-length winner, before winning the Castleford Chase later that month. He then finished 5th in the Victor Chandler Chase, fell in the Game Spirit Chase, and finishing 2nd in the Emblem Chase at Kempton, where he failed by a length when giving away a stone in weight. He then went back to Cheltenham, where he was sent off the 5/2 favourite for the Queen Mother Champion Chase and scored a 5-length victory over Deep Sensation. He ended the season at Aintree, where he won the Melling Chase at the same price. Season 1995-1996 On his seasonal debut, Viking Flagship finished a distant 4th in the Tingle Creek Chase. After finishing a 15-length third in the John Bull Chase in his next start, he won the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury and the Emblem Chase at Kempton. He returned to Cheltenham for his next start, where he finished 2nd in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, before winning the Melling Chase again. Season 1996-1997 The season only brought one success for Viking Flagship in the Emblem Chase, but he also placed in the Queen Mother Champion Chase and the Melling Chase. Season 1997-1998 The season proved to be the final season of Viking Flagship's racing career. He began by beating Mulligan by 5 lengths in the Haldon Gold Cup. He then went back to Sandown for the Tingle Creek Chase, where he went down by a head to Ask Tom. After winning the Castleford Chase again, he finished 3rd and 5th respectively in the Game Spirit Chase and the Queen Mother Champion Chase. Viking Flagship died in 2000.

The earliest Welsh literature was poetry, which was extremely intricate in form from its earliest known examples, a tradition sustained today. Poetry was followed by the first British prose literature in the 11th century (such as that contained in the Mabinogion). Welsh-language literature has repeatedly played a major part in the self-assertion of Wales and its people. It continues to be held in the highest regard, as evidenced by the size and enthusiasm of the audiences attending the annual National Eisteddfod of Wales (Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru), probably the largest amateur arts festival in Europe, which crowns the literary prize winners in a dignified ceremony. Middle Ages The mediaeval period had three stages. The Earliest Poets wrote praise poems for rulers and lords of Welsh dynasties from Strathclyde to Cornwall. In the 11th century, Norman influence and challenge disrupted Welsh cultures, and the language developed into Middle Welsh. The next period is the Poets of the Princes, when Welsh rulers fought each other and the English in shifting alliances. The first prose literature of Wales was compiled in the 11th century. The next stage was the Poets of the Nobility. The earliest praise poetry to survive is by the poets Taliesin and Aneirin. Praise poetry was powerful propaganda, inspiring loyalty and courage from the teulu, the warband or retinue of a king, prince or lord. It spread his fame, and that of named warriors, as widely as possible, creating a kind of immortality and glory. The art was so valued that the beirdd (bards) had their liberal rights set out in native Welsh law. The highest levels of the poetic art in Welsh are intensely intricate. The bards were extremely organised and professional, with a structured training which lasted many years. As a class, they proved very adaptable: when the princely dynasties ended in 1282, and Welsh principalities were annexed by England, they found necessary patronage with the next social level, the uchelwyr, the landed gentry. The shift led creatively to innovation - the development of the cywydd metre, with looser forms of structure. The professionalism of the poetic tradition was sustained by a guild of poets, or Order of bards, with its own \\"rule book\\". This \\"rule book\\" emphasised their professional status, and the making of poetry as a craft. An apprenticeship of nine years was required for a poet to be fully qualified. The rules also set out the payment a poet could expect for his work - these payments varied according to how long a poet had been in training and also the demand for poetry at particular times during the year. There were also cyfarwyddiaid (sing. cyfarwydd), storytellers. These were also professional, paid artists; but, unlike the poets, they seem to have remained anonymous. It is not clear whether these storytellers were a wholly separate, popular level class, or whether some of the bards practised storytelling as part of their repertoire. Little of this prose work has survived, but even so it provides the earliest British prose literature. These native Welsh tales and some hybrids with French/Norman influence form a collection known in modern times as the Mabinogion. The name became established in the 19th century but is based on a linguistic mistake (a more correct term is Mabinogi). Welsh literature in the Middle Ages also included a substantial body of laws, genealogies, religious and mythical texts, histories, medical and gnomic lore, and practical works, in addition to literature translated from other languages such as Latin, Breton or French. Besides prose and longer poetry, the literature includes the distinctive Trioedd, Welsh Triads, short lists usually of three items, apparently used as aids to memory. 16th and 17th centuries The 16th and 17th centuries in Wales, as in the rest of Europe, were a period of great change. Politically, socially, and economically the foundations of modern Wales were laid at this time. In the Laws in Wales Acts 1535-1542 Wales was annexed and integrated fully into the English kingdom, losing any vestiges of political or legal independence. The political-religious settlement of Elizabeth I through the Act of Uniformity 1559 made Wales in name a Protestant country; this was reinforced by developments during and after the English Civil War. This period also saw the beginnings of industries such as coal mining, metal-mining for lead and iron smelting, which led to the mass industrialisation of the following centuries. =End of the guild of poets= From the middle of the 16th century onwards, a decline is seen in the praise tradition of the poets of the nobility, the cywyddwyr. It became more and more difficult for poets to make their living ‚Äî primarily for social reasons beyond their control. The Dissolution of the Monasteries, which had become important sources of patronage for the poets, and the anglicisation of the nobility during the Tudor period, exemplified by the Laws in Wales Acts, meant that there were fewer and fewer patrons willing or able to support the poets. But there were also internal reasons for the decline: the conservatism of the Guild of poets, or Order of bards, made it very difficult for it to adapt to the new world of Renaissance learning and the growth of printing. However, the Welsh poetic tradition with its traditional metres and cynghanedd (patterns of alliteration) did not disappear completely, although it did lose its professionalism, and came into the hands of \\"ordinary\\" poets who kept it alive through the centuries. Cynghanedd and traditional metres are still used today by many Welsh-language poets. =Renaissance learning= By 1571 Jesus College, Oxford, was founded to provide an academic education for Welshmen, and the commitment of certain individuals, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, ensured that the Welsh language would be part of the new Renaissance in learning. First printed Welsh book In 1546 the first book to be printed in Welsh was published, Yn y llyvyr hwnn (\\"In this book\\") by Sir John Price of Brecon. John Price (c. 1502-55) was an aristocrat and an important civil servant. He served as Secretary of the Council of Wales and the Marches and he was also one of the officers responsible for administration of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the area. He was also a scholar who embraced the latest ideas relating to religion and learning: reform and humanism. It is also known that he was a collector of manuscripts on various subjects, including the history and literature of Wales. Other humanists and scholars Shortly afterwards the works of William Salesbury began to appear. Salesbury was an ardent Protestant and coupled his learning with the new religious ideas from the Continent; he translated the New Testament into Welsh and compiled an English-Welsh dictionary, among other works. On the other hand, Gruffudd Robert was an ardent Catholic, but in the same spirit of learning published an important Welsh grammar while in enforced exile in Milan in 1567. A huge step forward for both the Welsh language and its literature was the publication, in 1588, of a full-scale translation of the Bible by William Morgan. =Other works= Most of the works published in the Welsh language for at least the next century were religious in nature. Morgan Llwyd, a Puritan, wrote in both English and Welsh, recounting his spiritual experiences. Other notable writers of the period included Vavasor Powell. During this period, poetry also began to take a religious turn. William Pugh was a Royalist and a Catholic. By now, women as well as men were writing, but little of their work can be identified. Katherine Philips of Cardigan Priory, although English by birth, lived in Wales for most of her life, and was at the centre of a literary coterie comprising both sexes. =Beginnings of Welsh writing in English= The seeds of Anglo-Welsh literature can also be detected, particularly in the work of Henry Vaughan and his contemporary, George Herbert, both Royalists. 18th century In the 18th century the trend towards religious literature continued and grew even stronger as Nonconformism began to take hold in Wales. The Welsh Methodist revival, initially led by Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland, produced not only sermons and religious tracts, but also hymns and poetry by William Williams Pantycelyn, Ann Griffiths and others. The Morris brothers of Anglesey were leading figures in the establishment of the London Welsh societies, and their correspondence is an important record of the time. The activities of the London Welshmen helped ensure that Wales retained some kind of profile within Britain as a whole. The activities of a number of individuals, including Thomas Jones of Corwen and the Glamorgan stonemason and man of letters, Iolo Morganwg, led to the institution of the National Eisteddfod of Wales and the invention of many of the traditions which surround it today. Although Iolo is sometimes called a charlatan because so many of his \\"discoveries\\" were based on pure myth, he was also an inveterate collector of old manuscripts, and thereby performed a service without which Welsh literature would have been the poorer. Some of the Welsh gentry continued to patronise bards, but this practice was gradually dying out. 19th century Largely as a result of the Industrial Revolution, there was a large influx of people into the South Wales Valleys during the 19th century. Although many of them were English, some made an effort to learn the Welsh language in order to integrate into the local communities, and there was increased demand for literature in the form of books, periodicals, newspapers, poetry, ballads and sermons. Some of the wealthier incomers, such as Lady Charlotte Guest, Lady Llanover and others, were of active assistance in the trend towards a richer cultural life. Thanks partly to the eisteddfodau, writing became a popular pastime, and all forms of poetry thrived. Poets now used their bardic names to disguise their identity in competitions, and continued to use them when they became well known. The most celebrated poets of the century were: Evan Evans, John Blackwell, William Thomas and John Ceiriog Hughes, who went by the bardic names of \\"Ieuan Glan Geirionydd\\", \\"Alun\\", \\"Islwyn\\" and \\"Ceiriog\\" respectively. The novel had been slow to pick up momentum in Wales. Translations of works such as Uncle Tom's Cabin existed, but the first recognised novelist in the Welsh language was Daniel Owen, author of Rhys Lewis (1885) and Enoc Huws (1891), among others. 20th century onwards In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Welsh literature began to reflect the way the Welsh language was increasingly becoming a political symbol. Two of the greatest figures in the literary history of this period were the prolific Saunders Lewis and the writer/publisher Kate Roberts. Lewis, who had been brought up in Liverpool, was a leader of the nationalist movement, jailed for his part in protests; he chose drama as a means of pleading the rightness of his cause. Novelist Kate Roberts worked as a teacher, and was one of few writers to have lived in and written about both North Wales and South Wales. The industrialisation of parts of Wales was now beginning to be regarded as a mixed blessing, and the old agricultural (agrarian) way of life which persisted in most of the country was idealised by many writers. However, a more realistic picture of Gwynedd farming communities between the Wars was presented by John Ellis Williams (1924-2008) in both English and Welsh. His reminiscences appeared in community newspapers, the Countryman magazine, and subsequently in paperback format in English under the titles of Clouds of Time and other Stories (1989) and Rare Welsh Bits (2000). A free spirit in the Welsh publishing circle, Williams was neither an academic nor a politician, but had embraced Existentialism in post- Second World War France and had an active friendship and correspondence with Simone de Beauvoir. The 1940s also saw the creation of a notable writing group in the Rhondda, called the \\"Cadwgan Circle\\". Writing almost entirely in the Welsh language, the movement, formed by J. Gwyn Griffiths and his wife K√§the Bosse-Griffiths, included the Welsh writers Pennar Davies, Rhydwen Williams, James Kitchener Davies and Gareth Alban Davies. After a relatively quiet period between 1950-1970, large numbers of Welsh-language novels began appearing from the 1980s onwards, with such authors as Aled Islwyn and Angharad Tomos. In the 1990s there was a distinct trend towards postmodernism in Welsh prose writing, especially evident in the work of such authors as Wiliam Owen Roberts and Mihangel Morgan. Meanwhile, Welsh poetry, which had been verging on stagnation, took on a new lease of life as poets sought to regain mastery over the traditional verse forms, partly to make a political point. Alan Llwyd and Dic Jones were leaders in the field. Female poets such as Menna Elfyn gradually began to make their voices heard, overcoming the obstacle of the male-dominated bardic circle and its conventions. The scholar Sir Ifor Williams also pioneered scientific study of the earliest Welsh written literature, as well as the Welsh language itself, recovering the works of poets like Taliesin and Aneirin from the uncritical fancies of various antiquarians, such as the Reverend Edward Davies who believed the theme of Aneirin's Gododdin was the massacre of the Britons at Stonehenge in 472.

Common names are parachute plant, fountain flower, and umbrella plant. It is an evergreen, prostrate, slender twiner, nearly hairless, with sparse, succulent leaves. The roots form narrowly fusiform clusters. The distinctive greenish white funnel-shaped (having a corolla-tube) flowers are 5‚Äì7 cm long and are placed on a delicate stalk. Due to the fact that the corolla lobes are partially fused, the opening of the flowers is partially inhibited. The tips of the petals do not separate, but instead form a roof or umbrella-like dome on the flower, while the fused bottom forms the tube. The openings between the petals are also referred to as windows, hence the name windowed flowers.Focko Weberling (Author), R. J. Pankhurst (Translator) (1992); Morphology of Flowers and Inflorescences. Cambridge University Press; New edition. The flower itself serves as a biological fly-pollinated pitfall-trap, that traps flies when they descend into the corolla tube. Small hairs that point downwards prevent the insect from escaping. Once trapped, the fly is thoroughly covered in pollen and only released when the flower reaches the end of its life and the hairs weaken. This species attracts Desmometopa flies of the family Milichiidae by simulating the scent of an injured honey bee, tricking the flies into pollinating.http://www.the- scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/47214/title/To-Attract-Pollinators-- Flower-Mimics-Wounded-Bee/#post143971 Cultivation In temperate regions this tender plant is cultivated as a houseplant.

The former parish of St Stephens by Launceston was abolished in 1894: St Stephens by Launceston Urban became part of the town of Launceston, while St Stephens by Launceston Rural became part of Launceston Rural District.A Vision of Britain Through Time : St Stephens by Launceston Civil Parish Retrieved 5 October 2010 The parish lies immediately north west of the town of Launceston and is bounded to the south by the parishes of Launceston, St Thomas the Apostle Rural, and Lawhitton. To the east it is bounded by the River Tamar (the border between Cornwall and Devon). To the north and north-west it is bordered by the parishes of Werrington, North Petherwin and Egloskerry. History  In Anglo-Saxon times there was a monastery here dedicated to St Stephen whose canons owned the surrounding land including the town of Launceston (i.e. Lan-stefan-ton) (the name did not then belong to Dunheved the present town). A mint was established here as early as the reign of Aethelred II, 976, but only one specimen is known to exist (it weighs 1.61g).British Numismatic Journal; ser.

Oxford: Ashmolean Museum However, after the Norman Conquest the Norman Earl acquired Dunheved and rebuilt the castle there. He expropriated the market and mint of the canons and the townspeople followed them to Dunheved.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; p. 198 (The name of Launceston belonged originally to the monastery and town here, but was then transferred to the town of Dunheved.) The church of St Stephen retained its importance and remained the mother church of many of the surrounding parishes, Tremaine, Egloskerry, Tresmeer, Werrington, St Giles, Laneast, St Thomas, St Mary Magdalene and others throughout the Middle Ages. Notable buildings  The parish church, dedicated to St Stephen, is within the northern outskirts of the town of Launceston at . The church's buttressed and battlemented tower (16th century) houses a ring of six bells. The church was built in the early 13th century after the monastery which had been on this site had moved into the valley near the castle. The old tower was demolished by Reginald Earl of Cornwall. The present fine tower was built in the 16th century; the font is Norman.

The case was decided in the House of Lords. Facts Mr Ebrahimi and Mr Nazar were partners. They decided to incorporate as the business was highly successful, buying and selling expensive rugs. Their store was originally in Nottingham, and then moved to London at 220 Westbourne Grove. Mr Ebrahimi and Mr Nazar were the sole shareholders in the company and took dividends rather than director's salary for tax reasons. A few years later, when Mr Nazar's son came of age, he was appointed to the board of directors and Mr Ebrahimi and Mr Nazar both transferred shares to him. After a falling out between the directors Mr Nazar and son called a company meeting, at which they passed an ordinary resolution to have Mr Ebrahimi removed as a director. Mr Ebrahimi, clearly unhappy at this, applied to the court for a remedy to have the company wound up. Judgment The House of Lords stated that as a company is a separate legal person, the court would not normally entertain such an application. However, they believed that as the company was so similar in its operation as it was when it was a partnership, they created what is now known as a quasi- partnership. Mr Ebrahimi had a legitimate expectation that his management function would continue and that the articles would not be used against him in this way. Based on the personal relationship between the parties it would be inequitable to allow Mr Nazar and his son to use their rights against Mr Ebrahimi so as to force him out of the company and so it was just and equitable to wind it up. The company was wound up and Mr Ebrahimi received his capital interest. Lord Wilberforce gave the following judgment. Significance Soon after the remedy for unfair prejudice was introduced, which allows a court to simply order a minority shareholder to be bought out, rather than a company being wound up. This is found in the Companies Act 2006 sections 994 to 996.

He represented the town of Halifax in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1818 to 1820. He was president of the Royal Acadian School. He was born in Cornwallis Township, the son of Mason Cogswell and Lydia Huntington, and was educated at King's College. He studied law with Richard John Uniacke and was called to the bar in 1798, setting up practice in Halifax. In 1805, Cogswell married Isabella Ellis. He was named deputy provincial secretary in 1812 and, in 1818, Registrar of the Court of Chancery. In 1816, he purchased The Carleton. With Martin Gay Black and others, he helped establish the Halifax Banking Company in 1825, serving as first president for the bank. In 1831, Cogswell was named to the province's Council. He also served as commissioner of the vice admiralty court and president of the Halifax Board of Health. Cogswell was president of the Albion Fire and Life Insurance Company and of the Annapolis Iron Mining Company. An obvious target for political reformers, he lost most of his political appointments by 1841. Cogswell helped support the Halifax Mechanics' Institute, was a generous supporter of King's College and contributed to Halifax charities. In his later years, he lobbied for a railway link between Halifax and Quebec City. He died at Halifax at the age of 78. His daughter Isabella Binney Cogswell went on to become a prominent philanthropist and his son James Colquhoun Cogswell later served as president of the Halifax Banking Company.

Life Boullogne was born and died in Paris, and was the brother of Bon Boullogne. Their father, Louis Boullogne, feared rivalry between the two brothers if Louis the younger became a painter and so at first opposed his wish to do so. However, his vocation finally won through and every evening Louis crossed Paris to go with Bon to draw at the Acad√©mie. Aged 18 he won the grand prix de peinture and left for Rome in 1676, when his brother returned from there. He made copies after The School of Athens, Disputation of the Holy Sacrament and many other works by Raphael, from which the Gobelins made many different tapestries for the French king. Returning through Lombardy and Venice in 1680, Louis returned to Paris and soon won a great reputation. In 1681 he was received as a member of the Acad√©mie : his reception piece showed Augustus closing the doors to the temple of Janus, after the battle of Actium. On 3 February 1688 he married Marguerite Bacquet. In 1722, he was chosen to design the medals and mottos for the Acad√©mie des inscriptions, receiving a new 1,000 livres pension and the ordre de Saint-Michel. In 1723, he was made rector of the Acad√©mie; in 1724, first painter to the king, with letters patent of nobility for him and his descendants; and, in 1725, director of the Acad√©mie, offices he held until his death. His students included , Louis Galloche and Jacques-Fran√ßois Courtin. A strong supporter of the Acad√©mie, Louis de Boullogne supported its students with his lessons and his protection. He was the sworn enemy of the pochades and bambochades, claiming that only those with great skill and a fully formed taste could be allowed to paint. Louis Boullogne was buried at Saint-Eustache, parish of his birth. He left a vast fortune to four children he had had with Bacquet - two sons (the eldest was councilor to the parlement de Metz, then conseiller d'√âtat and an intendant des finances et ordres du roi, and the younger receiver general of finances for Tours) and two daughters (of which one married Jean-Pierre Richarol, receiver general of finances, with whom she had the painter Jean- Claude Richard, and the other became a nun). Jacques Fran√ßois Courtin was his pupil. Works In general, his compositions displayed a firm understanding of mise en sc√®ne, with a firm touch and striking colors. His heads display a great deal of expression and character and his talents were suited to easel paintings as well as large murals. His drawings are in black chalk, on white, blue or gray paper, with some slight hatching. In some, the features are fixed and the shadows are faded.

He has won several awards, including the Jules L√©ger Prize for New Chamber Music in 2000 for his work Catalogue de bombes occidentales,Jules L√©ger Prize for New Chamber Music at canadacouncil.ca the Prix opus for Composer of the Year in 2002, Conseil qu√©b√©cois de la musique and the Prix Qu√©bec-Flandre in 2003. Born in Quebec City, Ristic's parents originated from Poland and Montenegro. He began his professional studies at the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al in mathematics, and Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al where he studied piano, harpsichord, and musical composition. His background in mathematics has influenced his work as a music theorist, with a particular interest being the mathematical representation of sound. In the early 1990s he has applied himself to research in video synchronisation by the algorithmic numerical analysis of audio data.Biography of Andr√© Ristic at smcq.qc.ca Later on, the use of mathematical models in his compositions took various forms, usually mixing simple musical materials with sophisticated systems such as the Lottka-Volterra equations. In the mid-1990s Ristic served as the pianist for the Ensemble contemporain de Montr√©al. In 1998 he co-founded the chamber ensemble Trio Fibonacci with Gabriel Prynn and Julie-Anne Derome, performing and composing music for the group until 2006. The ensemble notably won the Prix opus in 2001. As a pianist, he is regularly invited by many contemporary music festivals Colloque 1999 , Printemps du Qu√©bec, Ars musica, festivals de Huddersfield, Festival de Strasbourg et Festival de Aldeburgh Festival Montr√©al/ Nouvelles Musiques (MNM) and Canadian orchestras. He has also commissioned, premiered or championed several pieces by other composers of his generation, such as Pierre Kolp, Petar Klanac, Yannick Plamendon, Moritz Eggert and Enno Poppe. Ristic played for many years with the KORE Ensemble in Montreal (2000-2007). In 2004 he moved to Brussels to join the piano faculty at the Institut Jaques-Dalcroze (Brussels) where he currently remains (2016). Since quitting the Fibonacci Trio (2006) in Belgium he actively performs with the ensemble Musiques Nouvelles in Mons. Composer Ristic has written music for orchestra, chamber and solo instrumental music, as well as music for movies, the opera and museum/site-dependent installations. His catalogue numbers several dozen works for diverse combinations and situations. As a music theoretician, he has developed the mathematical representation of sound and some model codes to produce music by signal theory and dynamic or static differential systems. In his works, one can easily find numeric implement researches aiming to develop new technics of vector geometry applied to musical gestures (in early works); later, the use of simplified musical elements seems to 'hide' the use of complex systems generating musical formal structure rather than musical objects (especially since the opera les Aventures de Madame Merveille. Andr√© Ristic has received commissions from the Ensemble TUYO, the Ensemble Contemporain de Montr√©al, Black Jackets Company, Ensemble Musiques Nouvelles, Continuum (Toronto), Soundstreams Canada, the Esprit Orchestra, the Orchestre M√©tropolitain (Montreal) and from concert artists Marc Couroux, Stephane Ginsburgh, and Trio Fibonacci. He composed music for Stephan Miljevic's feature films, Monsieur, Monsieur and L'Apr√®s- midi de Sonia. Ristic's style underlines musical optimism by setting up theatre and stage elements in the music he creates or he performs. He is also fond of popular culture and as such uses numerous references to folk dances, pop music.

Jonathan (1725-1807), Chester, Nova Scotia He was born in Halifax, the son of Jonathan Prescott and Anne Blagden. He entered business in partnership with William Lawson. Prescott married Hannah Whidden in 1796. Prescott prospered during the Napoleonic Wars through ownership of ships supplying the British military and by shrewd trade. He retired from business in 1811 selling his wharves and warehouse complex on the Halifax waterfront to Enos Collins. The following year, he settled on a country estate called Acacia Grove in Starr's Point near Port Williams in Nova Scotia's Annapolis Valley. In 1814, he married Mariah Hammill after the death of his first wife. He was interested in the development of fruit trees, owning extensive orchards, importing fruit trees from Britain, Lower Canada and the United States and raising more exotic fruit in hothouses. Prescott, who often shared his stock with other growers, is credited with introducing many of the apple varieties commonly grown commercially in the province in the years that followed, including the Gravenstein, which became a provincial favourite. He was president of the King's County Horticultural Society and vice-president of the Nova Scotia Horticultural Society. In 1825, Prescott was named to the province's Council, serving until 1838.

Madeleine BoullogneThe old spelling is Boullongne, sometimes also written Boulogne. (baptised 24 July 1646, Paris - 30 January 1710, Paris) was a French Baroque still life painter. Family She was the daughter of Louis Boullogne (painter and one of the founders of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture) and the sister of the painters Bon, Louis and Genevi√®ve Boullogne. Life On 7 November 1669 she was received into the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. She began working in the royal workshops, notably at the Palais des Tuileries, where she painted four canvases for the antechamber to the Grand appartement du roi, but also at the Versailles, where she painted for the antechamber of the Grand appartement de la reine. Madeleine Boullogne lived an austere and pious life, teaching many students, remaining unmarried and living with her brother Bon. Marked by a strict Augustinism bordering on Jansenism, she lived a semi- monastic life. Her presence in the N√©crologe de Port-Royal well shows this lifestyle : She painted many works on life at Port-Royal-des-Champs, that Louise-Magdeleine Horthemels then engraved and which were extremely popular. She also painted still lifes and many portraits, as well as many religious paintings. Madeleigne Boullogne was forgotten little by little over the 18th century, with some of her paintings even being attributed to others. She is best known for her paintings on Port-Royal, especially since many of her paintings at the Tuileries have disappeared and most of her work at Versailles was destroyed in the construction of the Galerie des Glaces.

Career The south porch doors at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham 1904. Salada Tea Company, Boston. 1927. Lady altar at St Bartholomew's Brighton He was born at 91 Red Rock Street in West Derby near Liverpool on 12 March 1864. He studied at the Kidderminster School of Art before being articled to the architect Edward James Shrewsbury in Maidenhead. He then worked and was trained in the practices of John Oldrid Scott, John Belcher and J. D. Sedding. After Sedding's death in 1891 Wilson completed many of Sedding's schemes. He followed Sedding's ideals, but his designs were often more original and grander in scale. From about 1895 Wilson designed metalwork, church plate and furnishings, jewellery and sculpture, becoming a gifted craftsman in the Arts and Crafts Movement. He was in business at 17 Vicarage Gate, Kensington, London from 1896 to 1899. In 1892 he joined the Art Workers Guild. From 1896 he taught in London at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, and from 1901 taught metalwork at the Royal College of Art. He was the first editor of the Architectural Review, from 1896 to 1901. In 1902 he became associated with the circle of William Richard Lethaby in the Liverpool Cathedral Scheme. In 1903 his practical manual, Silverwork and Jewellery, was published. In 1905 he designed the bronze doors for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. Wilson selected the British jewellery for the Paris Exhibition of 1914. He served as President of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society from 1915 to 1922, organised the major Arts and Crafts Exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1916, and in 1917 became Master of the Art Workers Guild. He was a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. After World War I, he again selected British jewellery for the Paris Exhibition of 1925. Personal life In 1901 he married Margaret Ellinor Morse, the daughter of Francis Morse, Vicar of St. Mary's Church, Nottingham. They had one son and three daughters. In 1922 he emigrated to Paris, and after the death of his wife in 1931, he died in Menton on 7 March 1934.

She was wrecked without loss of life on 26 October 1819 in the Kent Group in Bass Strait. She was on a voyage from Port Jackson to India. On August 1819, Daphne, Captain Howard, sailed from Hobart for Port Jackson with wheat and potatoes.[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/656487 The Hobart Town Gazette and Southern Reporter, Sat 14 Aug 1819, P. 1. \\"HOBART TOWN\\".] Daphne departed Sydney bound for India on 10 October 1819 under the command of John Howard. As she passed through Bass Strait he stopped at several islands to purchase sealskins from sealers in the area. On 26 October a gale rose and Howard sheltered in the lee of East Island. Howard went ashore, probably to find sealers. On arriving on shore he noticed that Daphne was being driven towards the rocks. He returned on board but could do little to save the brig. He therefore ordered the passengers and crew to abandon ship. The passengers made it to shore safely but Daphne was totally destroyed. The longboat was badly damaged and it took Howard and his crew some eight days to repair it. He then took his chief mate and three seamen and headed to Launceston on 4 August. Although he was blown off course, he eventually made Hobart on 14 November 1819. There he chartered the sloop Governor Sorrell to rescue the eight passengers and crew remaining on East Island.Australian Shipwrecks - vol 1 1622-1850, Charles Bateson, AH and AW Reed, Sydney, 1972, p.59 Meanwhile, John Palmer arrived and took on board some of the wreck survivors and attempted to head back to Hobart. However she was wrecked too. One passenger lost her life. The survivors had to await the arrival of Governor Sorrel for their rescue. Lloyd's List reported on 4 July 1820 based on a report from Port Jackson dated 12 December 1819, that the brig Daphne, Howard, master, had wrecked about 200 miles north of the Derwent. She was a total loss but her crew had been saved. Another report stated that during a voyage from Port Jackson to India she was driven onto rocks off East Island, Van Diemen's Land, in the Kent Group and wrecked on 26 October 1819 and that all 13 people on board survived.

It embeds the concept of the reasonable person. Facts A group of children were having a day out with their Sunday school. They were meant to be having a picnic, but the rain had ruined it. The leader of the trip asked the manager of a tearoom, run by Glasgow Corporation, if she would allow the children to have their picnic on their premises. She agreed and the group entered. In the tearoom there was a tuck shop, the window to which was located midway along a corridor. The children had all started to line up along the corridor to buy sweets at the tuck shop. At this time a large tea urn was being carried along the corridor by two adults, to the main room of the tearoom. For a reason which was not explained, the hold of one of the bearers slipped so that tea was spilt and scalded several children (Muir being one of them). The parents of the girl sued Glasgow Corporation, claiming that they owed the child a duty of care and that they had breached this. Judgment The court held that the manager in charge owed a duty of care, generally, to everyone in the tearoom. However, she did not owe a duty of care to the Sunday school, to take additional precautions to prevent their being injured as a result of her allowing them to enter. So long as the tearoom was run in the same manner as it was day to day, and to the same safety standards, she was not required to take extra steps to prevent the incident which occurred. It was not reasonably foreseeable that allowing the children to come into the premises would result in one of them being scalded. As such, the incident was put down as an accident which could not have been prevented. Lord Macmillan said, \\"Legal liability is limited to those consequences of our acts which a reasonable man of ordinary intelligence and experience so acting would have in contemplation. \\"The duty to take care,\\" as I essayed to formulate it in Bourhill v. Young, \\"is the duty to avoid doing or omitting to do anything the doing or omitting to do which may have as its reasonable and probable consequence injury to others, and the duty is owed to those to whom injury may reasonably and probably be anticipated if the duty is not observed.\\" This, in my opinion, expresses the law of Scotland, and I apprehend that it is also the law of England. \\" Lord Macmillan spoke on the test for the reasonable man, saying, \\"The standard of foresight of the reasonable man is, in one sense, an impersonal test. It eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question. Some persons are by nature unduly timorous and imagine every path beset with lions. Others, of more robust temperament, fail to foresee or nonchalantly disregard even the most obvious dangers. The reasonable man is presumed to be free both from over-apprehension and from over-confidence, but there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable man involves in its application a subjective element. \\" Notes Scottish case law 1943 in case law 1943 in British law 1943 in Scotland ","title":"Muir v Glasgow Corp"},{"id":"20609535","text":"Bregana (; )Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

Facts Mikhail Lermontov at Tilbury A widow, Mrs Joan Dillon, bought a cruise from a charterer's travel brochure on the cruise ship (named after the Russian poet, Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov). She paid a deposit and on 6 December 1985 received a booking form that said the ticket would be issued subject to conditions. On 24 January 1986 she received the ticket, which limited liability for personal injury. The ship sank. Mrs Dillon was injured and lost some valuables. She was sent a loss form without reference to personal injuries. The company offered her an ex gratia sum to settle if she signed a release form. She accepted and signed. In 1987 the insurance company and Mrs Dillon sued to recover damages for personal injury and other losses. Judgment =Trial court= Carruthers J awarded Mrs Dillon (1) restitution of the sum paid for the cruise (2) damages for loss of valuables (3) compensation for disappointment and distress (4) damages for personal injury (5) interest, all totaling $51,000.Dillon v Baltic Shipping Co (1989) 21 NSWLR 614. Award (1) was, however, reversed in the High Court (below). So far as incorporation of the exclusion clause went, he held that the contract was made on 6 December, so no new terms could be introduced when the balance of the cruise fare was paid. The terms were insufficiently notified. The Trade Practices Act 1974, s 74 applied to loss of luggage and s 68(1)(c) said the clauses limiting liability for its loss were void. By s 87, the widow was entitled to treat the release form as void ab initio because the company had intended to deceive and mislead the widow into thinking her rights under the contract of carriage were limited to the points under the loss form. The form was substantially and procedurally unfair and void ab initio under the Contracts Review Act 1980. Carruthers J said this. =High Court= The Baltic Shipping Company's appeal to the High Court was unsuccessful, except that they were able to establish that the purchase price of the ticket did not need to be returned in full. There had been merely a \\"partial failure of consideration\\", not total, and therefore restitutionary damages were barred. Another important point was that Mrs Dillon was not allowed to recover the balance of the fare and damages for breach of contract at the same time. The restitutionary and compensatory damages, thought the Court, should be alternatives. Mason CJ's judgment on this point was as follows. > THE CLAIM FOR RESTITUTION OF THE FARE Basis on which the claim is advanced > 5\\\\. By cl.12 of her further amended writ of summons in personam, the > respondent claimed: \\"return of the full fare in the sum of $2,205.00 as for > a total failure of consideration\\". By cl.7 of the defence, the appellant > simply denied that there had been a total failure of consideration. At > trial, the respondent's claim was refined so as to extend only to the > balance of the fare not already refunded by the appellant, that balance > being $1,417.50. 6\\\\. Carruthers J. held that the contract of passage was an > entire one, and said: > >> \\"In reality, the plaintiff got no benefit from this contract. It is true that she did have eight days cruising on the vessel and visited the Bay of Islands, Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington and Picton, but those benefits were entirely negated by the catastrophe which occurred upon departure from Picton. Thus, I would allow the amount claimed under this head.\\" > > In the Court of Appeal,. the appellant challenged the finding that there was > a total failure of consideration. The challenge was rejected. Kirby P, with > whom Gleeson CJ agreed on this point, noted that the appellant had urged > that there was no total failure of consideration as \\"(t)he respondent had > had the benefit of eight of fourteen days of an idyllic cruise.\\" He > concluded that the contract of carriage was an entire one. Kirby P said: > >> \\"On this point it is my view that Carruthers J reached the right conclusion. The respondent did not contract with the appellant for an eight- day cruise, still less for an eight-day cruise interrupted by the disaster which befell the MS Mikhail Lermontov. What she contracted for was a relaxing holiday experience. It is this that she failed to secure. The contract of carriage was properly categorised as an entire contract. I agree with the judge that there is a good analogy to Sir George Jessel MR's statement in Re Hall and Barker:Re Hall and Barker (1878) 9 Ch D 538, at p 545 '...If a shoemaker agrees to make a pair of shoes, he cannot offer you one shoe, and ask you to pay one half of the price.'\\" > > He then observed that, in order to avoid over-compensation, a claim for > restitution of money paid on a total failure of consideration will succeed > only if accompanied by counter-restitution of benefits bargained for and > received by the claimant. 7\\\\. In the Court of Appeal, the appellant also > relied upon cl.9 of the printed ticket terms and conditions. That clause > incorporated a right to proportional return of the consideration in certain > circumstances.In part the clause read: \\"If, for any reason beyond the > control of the Company during the voyage hereunder, it is impossible for the > vessel to continue to perform the advertised voyage then the Company will > use its best endeavours to substitute for the vessel named on the Passenger > Ticket another vessel whether belonging to the Company or whether or not in > the same class. In the event of such substitution the Passenger shall have > the option of accepting such substitute or of cancelling this contract. In > the event of such cancellation or in the event of its inability to arrange a > substitute the Company agrees to make travel arrangements for the onward > passage to the place of scheduled disembarkation and return to the Passenger > a proportional amount of his passage money less expenses incurred by the > Company in respect of such onward passage.\\" Kirby P. held that the clause, > while it could exclude the right to restitution in certain circumstances, > was inapplicable for two reasons: first, the clause was not incorporated > into the contract of carriage; secondly, by reason of the admission of > negligence by the appellant, the reason for the impossibility of > continuation of the voyage was not \\"beyond the control\\" of the appellant > and, therefore, a precondition of its operation was not satisfied. Gleeson > CJ agreed generally that the ticket terms and conditions were not > incorporated. However, he said that sufficient notice may have been given of > some terms and conditions printed on the ticket so as to incorporate them. > He did not consider cl.9 separately. 8\\\\.

In this Court, the appellant contends that the > majority in the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the respondent was > entitled to restitution of the whole of the fare.

Assessment *K Barker, 'Restitution of Passenger Fare' [1994] LMCLQ 291, argues there is no logical inconsistency between recovering restitutionary damages and compensatory damages, provided there is no double recovery. Also, he argues the court should have addressed the point that although there was no total failure of consideration, restitution should be allowed for partial failure of consideration.

It is in the Registration District of Launceston. The civil parish is bounded to the north by the Launceston parishes of St Thomas and St Mary Magdalene, to the east by Lawhitton and Lezant parishes and to the west by Trewen parish. The population of the parish in the 2001 census was 932. The district falls in the Altarnun electoral ward but the population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was almost unchanged at 931. South Petherwin village is situated 3 miles (5 km) south-southwest of the town of Launceston on the road from Launceston to Liskeard. The parish church, dedicated to St Paternus, stands in the village at . The church's tower has pinnacles and battlements and it houses a ring of five bells.http://www.southpetherwin.com South Petherwin's website History The Saint, Patern (or Padarn, Paternus) has had several candidates, which have become mixed and confused over the ages. It is believed that the actual St. Patern to which the Parishes of North and South Petherwin are dedicated, was actually the father of St. Constantine of Cornwall, a Cornish King who gave up his throne to become a monk. St. Patern and St. Constantine have thus always been linked, with dedications always being near one another (a Celtic practice when saints are related or work together) (St. Constantine Church at Milton Abbot being the case in point for South Petherwin). With the assumption that Dunheved (now known as Launceston) was the seat of the Celtic Kings of the area and that when Constantine became a monk he gave his territory to the Celtic Church, the Parish, along with North Petherwin and Lawhitton (Landwithan), would have been administered by the Celtic Bishop from St German's Priory. With the West Saxon invasion, the new King created a new diocese in the South West based at Sherborne in 909 AD. The lands which were controlled by the Celtic Bishop, were conceded to the new Bishop's control, to finance his work in Cornwall. It is with the Saxons that both Petherwins began to dominate the region, with the River Kensey being the natural divide. North Petherwin in the North with the new monastery of St. Stephens (a Saxon abbot being appointed to quell the Celts), and South Petherwin to the south of the Kensey: Dunheved was allowed to decline, as a means to crush the Celtic will. The see of the Diocese moved first to Crediton from Sherborne, then on to Exeter in 1050. =Norman period= The next radical change came with the Normans who sought to suppress the West Saxon control. First St. Stephen's was reduced as a monastery with the priory being moved across the Kensey to Newport. Then the ruined ancient fort of Dunheved was rebuilt as a Castle and walled town. At that time South Petherwin became the mother Church for Launceston, and it is the Church's importance in providing a valuable source of income to the church as a whole, that accounts for the size of the Church when it was rebuilt in the fifteenth century. Its significance is also shown by the existence of five roads which all lead to the Church. (Three still exist as normal tarmac roads; one is a footpath leading across fields from Tregadillett, with a fifth road from Trecrogo, which is now blocked off.) The estate was much larger than the present Parish and also included Trewen, hence the medieval association between St. Michael's Church, Trewen and St. Paternus's Church, South Petherwin (a link now ended with the consolidation of parochial charges). The parish is now situated in the Hundred of East and deanery of Trigg Major. Parish church South Petherwin Methodist Church The church consists of a chancel, nave, north and south aisles, and vestry. The chancel was restored in the 19th century. The arcades each consist of six four-centred arches, supported on monolith granite pillars. There are north and south porches. The tower has three stages, and is buttressed on the square; it is wholly built of local stone apart from the battlements and pinnacles which are of granite. The belfry contains six bells and a clock. There was a Holy Well in a field at Oldwit Farm, where water was collected and brought to the church each time a baptism took place. The Priest-in-charge of Lezant, Lewannick, North Hill and Lawhitton is responsible for this parish also; Trewen is the responsibility of the Vicar of Egloskerry.

The 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games took place near the USC campus at neighboring Exposition Park, where the Los Angeles Coliseum is located. Until the 1920s, the South Los Angeles neighborhood of West Adams was one of the most desirable areas of the City. As the wealthy were building stately mansions in West Adams and Jefferson Park, the white working class was establishing itself in Crenshaw and Hyde Park. Affluent blacks gradually moved into West Adams and Jefferson Park.Darnell Hunt and Ana-Christina Ramon (eds.). Black Los Angeles: American Dreams and Racial Realities. New York: New York University. . As construction along the Wilshire Boulevard corridor gradually increased in the 1920s, the development of the city was drawn west of downtown and away from South Los Angeles. In the eastern side of South Los Angeles (which the city calls the \\"Southeastern CPA\\") roughly east of the Harbor Freeway, the area grew southward in the late 1800s along the ever longer streetcar routes. Areas north of Slauson Boulevard were mostly built out by the late 1910s, while south of Slauson land was mostly undeveloped, much used by Chinese and Japanese Americans growing produce. In 1903, the farmers were bought out and Ascot Park racetrack was built, which turned into a \\"den of gambling and drinking\\". In the late 1910s the park was razed and freed up land for quick build-up of residential and industrial buildings in the 1920s. \\"By 1940, approximately 70 percent of the black population of Los Angeles was confined to the Central Avenue corridor\\"; the area of modest bungalows and low-rise commercial buildings along Central Avenue emerged as the heart of the black community in southern California. Originally, the city's black community was concentrated around what is now Little Tokyo, but began moving south after 1900.Southeast Los Angeles Community Plan, L.A. Preservation It had one of the first jazz scenes in the western U.S., with trombonist Kid Ory a prominent resident. Under racially restrictive covenants, blacks were allowed to own property only within the Main-Slauson-Alameda-Washington box and in Watts, as well as in small enclaves elsewhere in the city. The working- and middle-class blacks who poured into Los Angeles during the Great Depression and in search of jobs during World War II found themselves penned into what was becoming a severely overcrowded neighborhood. During the war, blacks faced such dire housing shortages that the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles built the virtually all-black and Latino Pueblo Del Rio project, designed by Richard Neutra. During this time, African Americans remained a minority alongside whites, Asians, and Hispanics; but by the 1930s those groups moved out of the area, African Americans continued to move in, and eastern South LA became majority black. Whites in previously established communities south of Slauson, east of Alameda and west of San Pedro streets persecuted blacks moving beyond established \\"lines\\", and thus blacks became effectively restricted to the area in between. =1948‚Äì1960s= When the Supreme Court banned the legal enforcement of race-oriented restrictive covenants in 1948's Shelley v. Kraemer, blacks began to move into areas outside the increasingly overcrowded Slauson-Alameda-Washington-Main settlement area. For a time in the early 1950s, southern Los Angeles became the site of significant racial violence, with whites bombing, firing into, and burning crosses on the lawns of homes purchased by black families south of Slauson. In an escalation of behavior that began in the 1920s, white gangs in nearby cities such as South Gate and Huntington Park routinely accosted blacks who traveled through white areas. The black mutual protection clubs that formed in response to these assaults became the basis of the region's street gangs.Dunn, William. 2007 The Gangs of Los Angeles. As in most urban areas, 1950s freeway construction radically altered the geography of southern Los Angeles. Freeway routes tended to reinforce traditional segregation lines.John Buntin (2009). L.A. Noir. . =1970s‚Äì1990s= Beginning in the 1970s, the rapid decline of the area's manufacturing base resulted in a loss of the jobs that had allowed skilled union workers to enjoy a middle class lifestyle. Downtown Los Angeles' service sector, which had long been dominated by unionized African Americans earning relatively high wages, replaced most black workers with newly arrived Mexican and Central American immigrants. Widespread unemployment, poverty and street crime contributed to the rise of street gangs in South Central, such as the Crips and Bloods. They became even more powerful with money from drugs, especially the crack cocaine trade, dominated by gangs in the 1980s. Paul Feldman of the Los Angeles Times wrote in 1989: > Leaders of the black community regret the branding of a large, predominantly > black sector of the city as South-Central, saying it amounts to a subtle > form of racial stereotyping.Paul Feldman, \\"The Name's the Thing in L.A. > Neighborhoods,\\" Los Angeles Times, June 18, 1981, image 113 They believed that such \\"distinctive neighborhoods as Leimert Park, Lafayette Square and the Crenshaw District were \\"well-removed\\" from South Central. =2000s‚Äìpresent= By the early 2000s, the crime rate of South Los Angeles had declined significantly. Redevelopment, improved police patrol, community- based peace programs, gang intervention work, and youth development organizations lowered the murder and crime rates to levels that had not been seen since the 1940s and '50s. Nevertheless, South Los Angeles was still known for its gangs at the time. In mid-2003, the City Council of Los Angeles voted to change the name South Central Los Angeles to South Los Angeles on all city documents, a move supporters said would \\"help erase a stigma that has dogged the southern part of the city.\\"RE: DISCONTINUING THE USE. OF THE TERM \\"SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES\\" ON ALL CITY DOCUMENTS On August 11, 2014, just two days after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a resident of South L.A., Ezell Ford, described as \\"a mentally ill 25-year-old man,\\" was fatally shot by two Los Angeles police officers (see Shooting of Ezell Ford). Since then, a number of protests focused on events in Ferguson have taken place in South Los Angeles. After the 2008 economic recession, housing prices in South Los Angeles recovered significantly, and by 2018, many had come to see South Los Angeles as a prime target for gentrification amid rising real estate values. Real estate values in South Los Angeles were further bolstered by news that Los Angeles will host the 2028 Olympics, with many of the games to be hosted on or near the USC campus. Demographics By the end of the 1980s, South Los Angeles had an increasing number of Hispanics and Latinos, mostly in the northeastern section of the region. According to scholars, \\"Between 1970 and 1990 the South LA area went from 80% black and 9% Latino to 50.3% black and 44% Latino.\\"Grant, David M., Melvin L. Oliver, and Angela D. James. 1996. \\"African Americans: Social and Economic Bifurcation,\\" in Waldinger, Roger and Medhi Bozorgmehr. Ethnic Los Angeles, New York: Russell Sage Foundation This massive and rapid residential demographic change occurred as resources in the area were shrinking due to global economic restructuring described above and due to the federal government's decrease in funding of urban anti-poverty and jobs programs, and other vital social services like healthcare. The socio- economic context described here increased the perception and the reality of competition amongst Asians, blacks, and Latinos in South LA. The results from the 2000 census which show continuing demographic change coupled with recent economic trends indicating a deterioration of conditions in South LA suggest that such competition will not soon ease.\\"Grant, et al. (1996), \\"African Americans\\" In the 2014 census, the area of South Los Angeles had a population of 271,040. 61.0% of the residents were Hispanic or Latino, 28.7% were African American. Many African Americans from South Los Angeles have moved to Palmdale and Lancaster in the Antelope Valley. South Los Angeles has received immigrants from Mexico and Central America.

A prolific writer, he began as a poet but later wrote mostly novels. His works are characterized by a strong autobiographical inspiration, and usually deal with social and psychological themes. Education Mario Tobino completed his degree in medicine in 1936, after which he embarked on a career that centered on the mental hospital setting, treating people with mental disabilities. Medical career Mario Tobino's work took him to Libya in June 1940. He worked as a doctor in Libya until October 1941, when war broke out in the country and he had to flee. His experience of Libya was recorded in the book Il deserto della Libia, which came out in 1952. In 2015, Staging Memory by Stefania Del Monte dedicates a whole section to the book. After returning from Libya, Tobino took the job of doctor in the Mental Hospital of Lucca. He worked in the hospital for over four decades. Works The period between spring and autumn of 1944 saw Tobino become an ardent supporter of the war of national liberation. His participation in the liberation efforts as a partisan developed him immensely as a writer. The experience morphed into the book Clandestino, which was published in 1962 and won him the Premio Strega. Tobino had published books before Clandestino. In 1953, he brought out Libere donne di Magliano, a work that established his place among important Italian writers. Tobino wrote another prize-winning book in 1972. His Per le antiche scale was the winner of the Premio Campiello that year. Tobino was a tireless writer. He was prolific even in his later life. In 1982 he published Gli ultimi giorni di Magliano, followed by La ladra in 1984 and in 1988 Tre amici. This last phase of his writing career was also marked by several literary prizes.

The members are vocalist Alan White, guitarist Jonathan Purcell, bass player Scott Millard and drummer Chris Briggs. Their music was influenced by bands as diverse as REM, the Cult, Television and the Velvet Underground. They were contemporaries of Died Pretty, Trilobites, Crash Politics, Candy Harlots, Bell Jar and The Screaming Tribesman. History The Faith was formed after Alan White and Chris Briggs wound up their former band Sons of Guns and joined forces with Scott Millard and Jonathan Purcell, both of whom had just finished up with Sydney band the Seamonsters. The Faith debut performance was in late 1987 supporting well-known local band Bell Jar at the Harold Park Hotel in Sydney's inner west. They were noticed straight away by their peers and quickly became a part of many local billings and line-ups throughout the next few months. A new label called RooArt records noticed the band in 1987. The Faith were invited to record a track for RooArt's inaugural Youngblood compilation with leading producer Nick Mainsbridge at Sydney's Paradise Studios. The Faith performing at The Annandale Hotel in Sydney, Australia, at the end of 1988. After many more live dates and touring commitments, The Faith had the chance to return to the studio in December 1988 and record their debut album, Chain of Flowers. Brett Myers, who was better known as the guitarist and songwriter for one Australia's most acclaimed international acts, Died Pretty, took the reins and produced the effort, along with Tony Espie, ARIA award-winning engineer, at Studios 301 in Castlereagh St. Chain of Flowers was released on the Survival Label, home to Screaming Tribesman, in December 1988 with the anticipation it would become an independent hit. The album received enormous amounts of critical praise from street press around the country, however radio failed to latch on and inevitably record sales failed to match the expectations. Although sales were respectable for an Independent release, it wasn't enough to guarantee interest from any of the major labels and the band lost momentum. Break up In the winter of 1989 and following the release of Chain of Flowers, the band took a forced hiatus as Alan White pursued his film directing career in the United States and at the same time Scott Millard filled in with appearances with the Candy Harlots. The band came together and toured in late 1989 however eventually different visions of the future forced the band to call it quits and no further material was released. The band reformed to record some demo's in 1990 with a new line up. Scott Millard had since moved on. The sessions, with Alex Ronayne on bass, yielded one track \\"Wild Changes\\" which was finally mixed some nine years later and released on the 1999 soundtrack of the Australian movie \\"Erskineville Kings\\". Post break up The 1990 sessions were to be the last time the Faith were to play together. Alan White continued his career in film and went on direct some of the world's most popular TV commercials and in 1999 released his first feature film, Erskineville Kings, starring Hugh Jackman. This was shortly followed by Risk, with Bryan Brown and the 2007 film Broken with Heather Graham. He also directed the TV series Technology Jones. Alan now lives in Los Angeles. Scott Millard left The Faith and briefly joined the Candy Harlots thence Crash Politics, Bell Jar, ID (Mushroom Records) and Clusterfunk (members of Crash Politics). After a break from playing rock based music he released a solo vinyl ep under the name Crackerjack, produced by Paul Mac, which was reproduced in its entirety on Sony Music's \\"Itch-E and Scratch-E and Friends\\" album (1994). Scott now resides in Singapore. Jonathan Purcell went on to play with ID (non-concurrent to Scott Millard's stint) and a career in taxation where he is now a GST legal interpretations advisor. Jonathan has recently recorded with Tegan Northwood on her new CD to be released on the Endgame Label later in 2007. Jonathan was also a member of Mark Easton's band Soggy Porridge in the mid-1980s and appears on their compilation CD 'Broken Romance' now available on plastic donut records. Jonathan resides in Sydney. Chris Briggs, originally a professional skateboarder in the early 80s, joined Sydney grunge band Earwig in 1992. Earwig won \\"Best New Band\\" in the Sandringham Hotel's \\"Battle of the Bands\\" in 1992, however did not record any material. From 1994. He now resides in Brisbane. Reformed The Faith reunited in December 2008 to record their second album \\"Gone Forever\\". The first song lifted from the as yet to be released album is a track \\"Surreal Eyes\\". This track was debuted on their MySpace page in October 2009.

Subsequently, he campaigned for it to be located in the city centre. His nominated site, on the corner of La Trobe Street and Bowen Street, was donated by the government from land reserved for the colonial Supreme Court. The site was chosen so that the college would benefit from a proximity to the Melbourne Public Library and Art Gallery (now the state State Library of Victoria) on the corner of Swanston Street and La Trobe Street. Due to its location in Melbourne's former justice precinct, the college originally bordered the Melbourne Gaol, City Watch-House (now Building 19) and Supreme Court (later the Magistrates' Court and now Building 20).

Campus development history RMIT New Academic Street complete renovation in 2017 From the 1890s, RMIT's campus had developed in an ad hoc manner of purpose-built and acquired buildings. Subsequently, no master plan for the campus was implemented until 1930. In 1929, it was granted the eastern side of Bowen Street for development ‚Äì over areas of the recently decommissioned Melbourne Gaol. The development of this area progressed slowly and was not fully completed until the mid-1950s. During this time, the campus was ‚Äì as described by architect Peter Elliot ‚Äì \\"just a cacophony of cluttered streets, laneways, dead-ends and hidden courts\\". In 1950, the Melbourne City Council granted the exclusive use of Bowen Street to RMIT for its campus. And, by the mid-1960s, the campus occupied all of the buildings fronting Bowen Street and a number of buildings fronting the eastern side of Swanston Street ‚Äì between La Trobe Street and Franklin Street. A comprehensive master plan for the campus was then developed by architect Osborn McCutcheon in 1965. The master plan included the controversial tower blocks ‚Äì Building 10 (Casey Wing), Building 12 (Gillespie Wing) and Building 14 ‚Äì which front the eastern side of Swanston Street. The buildings were constructed over the historic Ormond Mathematics School (where Building 14 stands), Automotive Engineering School and Foundry School (where Building 12 stands). They were intended to be part of the suite of five identical blocks which ran the length of Swanston Street from La Trobe Street to Franklin Street. However, after completion of the first three buildings, during the 1970s, public opinion swung against their design. Dubbed the \\"grey silos\\", the austere functionalist design of the towers was criticised for a lack of windows facing Swanston Street. As a result, the remaining two towers were never completed. In 1975, architect John Andrews was engaged to design the first stage of new Building 8 (Union House) in place of the fourth tower block. The lower three levels of the building were constructed as the first stage over the Pharmacy School and McComas Wool School as well as Pharmacy Lane (which originally connected the middle of Bowen Street with Swanston Street) and the northern section of Bowen Lane (the remaining section renamed Rodda Lane). The second stage of Building 8 was constructed in 1993 to a postmodern design by architect Peter Corrigan.Building 8 . RMIT Architecture. RMIT University. Retrieved 12 October 2012 It was the last large-scale building constructed on the Bowen Street blocks of the campus. The proposed fifth tower block was never built, and subsequently the historic Building 16 (Storey Hall) and Building 22 (Singer Building) still stand on the site. In the late 1990s, architect Peter Elliot was engaged to undertake the most significant redesign of the campus' urban landscape in its history. The first stage was completed in 2000, and included the redevelopment of Bowen Street into a pedestrian spine and creation of Ellis Court at its northern end and Bowen Terrace at its southern end as open spaces.RMIT Urban Spaces - Stage 1 .

It was built along the left and right banks of the Euphrates river with steep embankments to contain the river's seasonal floods. Babylon was originally a small Akkadian town dating from the period of the Akkadian Empire . The town became part of a small independent city-state with the rise of the First Babylonian dynasty in the 19th century BC. The Amorite king Hammurabi created a short-lived empire in the 18th century BC. He built Babylon into a major city and declared himself its king. Southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia and Babylon eclipsed Nippur as its holy city. The empire waned under Hammurabi's son Samsu-iluna and Babylon spent long periods under Assyrian, Kassite and Elamite domination. After being destroyed and then rebuilt by the Assyrians, Babylon became the capital of the short-lived Neo-Babylonian Empire from 609 to 539 BC. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. After the fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the city came under the rule of the Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian, Roman, and Sassanid empires. It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world , and again . It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above 200,000.Tertius Chandler. Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth: An Historical Census (1987), St. David's University Press (). . See Historical urban community sizes. Estimates for the maximum extent of its area range from 890 to . The remains of the city are in present- day Hillah, Babil Governorate, Iraq, about south of Baghdad, comprising a large tell of broken mud-brick buildings and debris. The main sources of information about Babylon‚Äîexcavation of the site itself, references in cuneiform texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia, references in the Bible, descriptions in classical writing (especially by Herodotus), and second-hand descriptions (citing the work of Ctesias and Berossus)‚Äîpresent an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city, even at its peak in the sixth century BC. Babylon was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 2019. Name The spelling Babylon is the Latin representation of Greek Babyl·πìn (), derived from the native (Babylonian) ', meaning \\"gate of the god(s)\\". The cuneiform spelling was KA2.DIGÃÉIR.RAKI. This would correspond to the Sumerian phrase kan di≈ãirak The íÜç KA2 is the ideograph for \\"gate\\", íÄ≠ DIGÃÉIR is \\"god\\", and the íäè ra is a genitive suffix. The final íÜ† KI is the determinative for a place name. Archibald Sayce, writing in the 1870s, postulated that the Semitic name was a loan-translation of the original Sumerian name. However, the \\"gate of god\\" interpretation is increasingly viewed as a Semitic folk etymology to explain an unknown original non-Semitic placename.Liane Jakob-Rost, Joachim Marzahn: Babylon, ed. Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. Vorderasiatisches Museum, (Kleine Schriften 4), 2. Auflage, Putbus 1990, p. 2 I.J. Gelb in 1955 argued that the original name was Babil or Babilla, of unknown meaning and origin, as there were other similarly-named places in Sumer, and there are no other examples of Sumerian place-names being replaced with Akkadian translations. He deduced that it later transformed into Akkadian ', and that the Sumerian name Ka-digÃÉirra was a loan translation of the Semitic folk etymology, and not the original name. The re-translation of the Semitic name into Sumerian would have taken place at the time of the \\"Neo-Sumerian\\" Third Dynasty of Ur. Dietz-Otto Edzard: Geschichte Mesopotamiens. Von den Sumerern bis zu Alexander dem Gro√üen, Beck, M√ºnchen 2004, p. 121. (Bab-Il). In the Hebrew Bible, the name appears as Babel ( Bavel, Tib. BƒÅ·∏áel; BƒÅwƒìl, Babel; in BƒÅbil), interpreted in the Book of Genesis to mean \\"confusion\\",. from the verb bilb√©l (, \\"to confuse\\").Magnus Magnusson, BC: The Archaeology of the Bible Lands. BBC Publications 1977, pp. 198‚Äì199. The modern English verb, ' (\\"to speak foolish, excited, or confusing talk\\"), is popularly thought to derive from this name but there is no direct connection. Ancient records in some situations use \\"Babylon\\" as a name for other cities, including cities like Borsippa within Babylon's sphere of influence, and Nineveh for a short period after the Assyrian sack of Babylon. Geography Schematic showing Babylon on the Euphrates River with major areas within inner and outer walls Babylon in 1932 Brick structures in Babylon, photographed in 2016 The remains of the city are in present-day Hillah, Babil Governorate, Iraq, about south of Baghdad, comprising a large tell of broken mud-brick buildings and debris. The site at Babylon consists of a number of mounds covering an area of about , oriented north to south, along the Euphrates to the west. Originally, the river roughly bisected the city, but the course of the river has since shifted so that most of the remains of the former western part of the city are now inundated. Some portions of the city wall to the west of the river also remain. Only a small portion of the ancient city (3% of the area within the inner walls; 1.5% of the area within the outer walls; 0.1% at the depth of Middle and Old Babylon) has been excavated. Known remains include: * Kasr ‚Äì also called Palace or Castle, it is the location of the Neo-Babylonian ziggurat Etemenanki and lies in the center of the site. * Amran Ibn Ali ‚Äì the highest of the mounds at to the south. It is the site of Esagila, a temple of Marduk which also contained shrines to Ea and Nabu. * Homera ‚Äì a reddish-colored mound on the west side. Most of the Hellenistic remains are here. * Babil ‚Äì a mound about high at the northern end of the site. Its bricks have been subject to looting since ancient times. It held a palace built by Nebuchadnezzar. Archaeologists have recovered few artifacts predating the Neo-Babylonian period. The water table in the region has risen greatly over the centuries, and artifacts from the time before the Neo-Babylonian Empire are unavailable to current standard archaeological methods. Additionally, the Neo-Babylonians conducted significant rebuilding projects in the city, which destroyed or obscured much of the earlier record. Babylon was pillaged numerous times after revolting against foreign rule, most notably by the Hittites and Elamites in the 2nd millennium, then by the Neo-Assyrian Empire and the Achaemenid Empire in the 1st millennium. Much of the western half of the city is now beneath the river, and other parts of the site have been mined for commercial building materials. Only the Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian period. These included 967 clay tablets, stored in private houses, with Sumerian literature and lexical documents. Nearby ancient settlements are Kish, Borsippa, Dilbat, and Kutha. Marad and Sippar were in either direction along the Euphrates.  Sources  Illustration by Leonard William King of fragment K. 8532, a part of the Dynastic Chronicle listing rulers of Babylon grouped by dynasty. Historical knowledge of early Babylon must be pieced together from epigraphic remains found elsewhere, such as at Uruk, Nippur, and Haradum. Information on the Neo-Babylonian city is available from archaeological excavations and from classical sources. Babylon was described, perhaps even visited, by a number of classical historians including Ctesias, Herodotus, Quintus Curtius Rufus, Strabo, and Cleitarchus. These reports are of variable accuracy and some of the content was politically motivated, but these still provide useful information. = Early references = References to the city of Babylon can be found in Akkadian and Sumerian literature from the late third millennium BC. One of the earliest is a tablet describing the Akkadian king ≈†ar-kali-≈°arri laying the foundations in Babylon of new temples for Ann≈´nƒ±ÃÑtum and Ilaba. Babylon also appears in the administrative records of the Third Dynasty of Ur, which collected in-kind tax payments and appointed an ensi as local governor.Wilfred G. Lambert, \\"Babylon: Origins\\"; in Cancik- Kirschbaum et al. (2011), pp. 71‚Äì76.Vedeler (2006), pp. 7‚Äì8. The so-called Weidner Chronicle (also known as ABC 19) states that Sargon of Akkad ( in the short chronology) had built Babylon \\"in front of Akkad\\" (ABC 19:51). A later chronicle states that Sargon \\"dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon, and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Akkad\\". (ABC 20:18‚Äì19). Van de Mieroop has suggested that those sources may refer to the much later Assyrian king Sargon II of the Neo-Assyrian Empire rather than Sargon of Akkad. =Classical dating= Ctesias, quoted by Diodorus Siculus and in George Syncellus's Chronographia, claimed to have access to manuscripts from Babylonian archives, which date the founding of Babylon to 2286 BC, under the reign of its first king, Belus.Records of the Past, Archibald Sayce, 2nd series, Vol. 1, 1888, p. 11. A similar figure is found in the writings of Berossus, who according to Pliny,N.H. vii. 57 stated that astronomical observations commenced at Babylon 490 years before the Greek era of Phoroneus, indicating 2243 BC. Stephanus of Byzantium wrote that Babylon was built 1002 years before the date given by Hellanicus of Lesbos for the siege of Troy (1229 BC), which would date Babylon's foundation to 2231 BC.The Seven Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World, George Rawlinson, Vol. 4, p. 526‚Äì527. All of these dates place Babylon's foundation in the 23rd century BC; however, cuneiform records have not been found to correspond with these classical (post-cuneiform) accounts. History Queen of the Night relief. The figure could be an aspect of the goddess Ishtar, Babylonian goddess of sex and love. By around the 19th century BC, much of southern Mesopotamia was occupied by Amorites, nomadic tribes from the northern Levant who were Northwest Semitic speakers, unlike the native Akkadians of southern Mesopotamia and Assyria, who spoke East Semitic. The Amorites at first did not practice agriculture like more advanced Mesopotamians, preferring a semi-nomadic lifestyle, herding sheep. Over time, Amorite grain merchants rose to prominence and established their own independent dynasties in several south Mesopotamian city-states, most notably Isin, Larsa, Eshnunna, Lagash, and later, founding Babylon as a state. =Old Babylonian period= Map showing the Babylonian territory upon Hammurabi's ascension in 1792 BC and upon his death in 1750 BC Old Babylonian alt= alt= According to a Babylonian date list, Amorite rule in Babylon began () with a chieftain named Sumu-abum, who declared independence from the neighboring city-state of Kazallu. Sumu-la-El, whose dates may be concurrent with those of Sumu-abum, is usually given as the progenitor of the First Babylonian dynasty. Both are credited with building the walls of Babylon. In any case, the records describe Sumu-la-El's military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence for Babylon.Vedeler (2006), pp. 8‚Äì15. \\"However, this later tradition is almost certainly a simplification or even a reworking of the actual events surrounding Sumu-abum, who was never regarded as an actual ancestor to the other kings of the Babylon I dynasty (Edzard 1957:122); in reality the relationship of Sumu-abum to Babylon was much more complex. It was long been noted that many of Sumu-abum's year names are identical or virtually identical to the year names of Sumu-la-el, whom we know for certain was king of Babylon. Goddeeris (2002:319‚Äì320) sums these parallels up as follows: Sa 1 and 2 / Sl 5 and 6: building the wall of Babylon. Sa 9 / Sl 'b': building the wall of Dilbat. Sa 13/14 / Sl 20/21: the destruction and seizure of Kazallu.\\" Babylon was initially a minor city-state, and controlled little surrounding territory; its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king. The older and more powerful states of Assyria, Elam, Isin, and Larsa overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of Hammurabi's short lived empire about a century later. Hammurabi (r. 1792‚Äì1750 BC) is famous for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the Code of Hammurabi. He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern Mesopotamia, including Isin, Larsa, Ur, Uruk, Nippur, Lagash, Eridu, Kish, Adab, Eshnunna, Akshak, Akkad, Shuruppak, Bad-tibira, Sippar, and Girsu, coalescing them into one kingdom, ruled from Babylon. Hammurabi also invaded and conquered Elam to the east, and the kingdoms of Mari and Ebla to the northwest. After a protracted struggle with the powerful Assyrian king Ishme-Dagan of the Old Assyrian Empire, he forced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign, spreading Babylonian power to Assyria's Hattian and Hurrian colonies in Asia Minor. After the reign of Hammurabi, the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia, whereas the north had already coalesced centuries before into Assyria. From this time, Babylon supplanted Nippur and Eridu as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia. Hammurabi's empire destabilized after his death. Assyrians defeated and drove out the Babylonians and Amorites. The far south of Mesopotamia broke away, forming the native Sealand Dynasty, and the Elamites appropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia. The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon, which again became a small city state. Texts from Old Babylon often include references to Shamash, the sun-god of Sippar, treated as a supreme deity, and Marduk, considered as his son. Marduk was later elevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered, perhaps reflecting Babylon's rising political power = Middle Babylon = In 1595 BC the city was overthrown by the Hittite Empire from Asia Minor. Thereafter, Kassites from the Zagros Mountains of north western Ancient Iran captured Babylon, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for 435 years, until 1160 BC. The city was renamed Karanduniash during this period. Kassite Babylon eventually became subject to the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365‚Äì1053 BC) to the north, and Elam to the east, with both powers vying for control of the city. The Assyrian king Tukulti- Ninurta I took the throne of Babylon in 1235 BC. By 1155 BC, after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians and Elamites, the Kassites were deposed in Babylon. An Akkadian south Mesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time. However, Babylon remained weak and subject to domination by Assyria. Its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts of the Levant, including the Arameans and Suteans in the 11th century BC, and finally the Chaldeans in the 9th century BC, entering and appropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves. The Arameans briefly ruled in Babylon during the late 11th century BC. =Assyrian period= Babylonian war, relief from his palace in Nineveh During the rule of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911‚Äì609 BC), Babylonia was under constant Assyrian domination or direct control. During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria, Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt, led by a chieftain named Merodach-Baladan, in alliance with the Elamites, and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon. In 689 BC, its walls, temples and palaces were razed, and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu, the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south. Destruction of the religious center shocked many, and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his own sons while praying to the god Nisroch was considered an act of atonement. Consequently, his successor Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city and make it his residence during part of the year. After his death, Babylonia was governed by his elder son, the Assyrian prince Shamash-shum- ukin, who eventually started a civil war in 652 BC against his own brother, Ashurbanipal, who ruled in Nineveh. Shamash-shum-ukin enlisted the help of other peoples against to Assyria, including Elam, Persia, Chaldeans, and Suteans of southern Mesopotamia, and the Canaanites and Arabs dwelling in the deserts south of Mesopotamia. Once again, Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians, starved into surrender and its allies were defeated. Ashurbanipal celebrated a \\"service of reconciliation\\", but did not venture to \\"take the hands\\" of Bel. An Assyrian governor named Kandalanu was appointed as ruler of the city. Ashurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive library at Ninevah. After the death of Ashurbanipal, the Assyrian empire destabilized due to a series of internal civil wars throughout the reigns of Assyrian kings Ashur-etil-ilani, Sin-shumu-lishir and Sinsharishkun. Eventually Babylon, like many other parts of the near east, took advantage of the chaos within Assyria to free itself from Assyrian rule. In the subsequent overthrow of the Assyrian Empire by an alliance of peoples, the Babylonians saw another example of divine vengeance.Albert Houtum-Schindler, \\"Babylon,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th ed. =Neo-Babylonian Empire= Cuneiform cylinder from reign of Nebuchadnezzar II honoring the exorcism and reconstruction of the ziggurat Etemenanki by Nabopolassar. Detail of a relief from the reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate alt= Under Nabopolassar, a previously Caldanian King, Babylon escaped Assyrian rule, and in an alliance with Cyaxares, king of the Medes who was his son in law together with Cimmerians, finally destroyed the Assyrian Empire between 612 BC and 605 BC. Babylon thus became the capital of the Neo-Babylonian (sometimes and possibly erroneously called the Chaldean) or Caldanian Empire. With the recovery of Babylonian independence, a new era of architectural activity ensued, particularly during the reign of his son Nebuchadnezzar II (604‚Äì561 BC).Saggs, H.W.F. (2000). Babylonians, p. 165. University of California Press. . Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds, including the Etemenanki ziggurat, and the construction of the Ishtar Gate‚Äîthe most prominent of eight gates around Babylon. A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is located in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin. Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon‚Äîone of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World‚Äîsaid to have been built for his homesick wife Amyitis. Whether the gardens actually existed is a matter of dispute. German archaeologist Robert Koldewey speculated that he had discovered its foundations, but many historians disagree about the location. Stephanie Dalley has argued that the hanging gardens were actually located in the Assyrian capital, Nineveh.Stephanie Dalley, (2013) The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World Wonder traced, OUP Nebuchadnezzar is also notoriously associated with the Babylonian exile of the Jews, the result of an imperial technique of pacification, used also by the Assyrians, in which ethnic groups in conquered areas were deported en masse to the capital. According to the Hebrew Bible, he destroyed Solomon's Temple and exiled the Jews to Babylon. The defeat was also recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles. =Persian conquest= In 539 BC, the Neo-Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great, king of Persia, with a military engagement known as the Battle of Opis. Babylon's walls were considered impenetrable. The only way into the city was through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates River. Metal grates were installed underwater, allowing the river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion. The Persians devised a plan to enter the city via the river. During a Babylonian national feast, Cyrus' troops upstream diverted the Euphrates River, allowing Cyrus' soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water. The Persian army conquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at the city center were unaware of the breach. The account was elaborated upon by Herodotus; or see and is also mentioned in parts of the Hebrew Bible.Isaiah 44:27Jeremiah 50‚Äì51 Herodotus also described a moat, an enormously tall and broad wall cemented with bitumen and with buildings on top, and a hundred gates to the city. He also writes that the Babylonians wear turbans and perfume and bury their dead in honey, that they practice ritual prostitution, and that three tribes among them eat nothing but fish. The hundred gates can be considered a reference to Homer, and following the pronouncement of Archibald Henry Sayce in 1883, Herodotus' account of Babylon has largely been considered to represent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon. However, recently, Dalley and others have suggested taking Herodotus' account seriously. Babylonian soldier in the Achaemenid army, circa 470 BCE, Xerxes I tomb. According to 2 Chronicles 36 of the Hebrew Bible, Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people, including the Jews, to return to their own lands. Text found on the Cyrus Cylinder has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of this policy, although the interpretation is disputed because the text only identifies Mesopotamian sanctuaries but makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea. Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius I, Babylon became the capital city of the 9th Satrapy (Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north), as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement. In Achaemenid Persia, the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalized, and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations. The city became the administrative capital of the Persian Empire and remained prominent for over two centuries. Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era.Cyrus Cylinder The British Museum. Retrieved July 23, 2011. The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk, but by the reign of Darius III, over-taxation and the strain of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon's main shrines and canals, and the destabilization of the surrounding region. There were numerous attempts at rebellion and in 522 BC (Nebuchadnezzar III), 521 BC (Nebuchadnezzar IV) and 482 BC (Bel-shimani and Shamash-eriba) native Babylonian kings briefly regained independence. However these revolts were quickly repressed and Babylon remained under Persian rule for two centuries, until Alexander the Great's entry in 331 BC. =Hellenistic period= In October of 331 BC, Darius III, the last Achaemenid king of the Persian Empire, was defeated by the forces of the Ancient Macedonian ruler Alexander at the Battle of Gaugamela. Under Alexander, Babylon again flourished as a center of learning and commerce. However, following Alexander's death in 323 BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar, his empire was divided amongst his generals, the Diadochi, and decades of fighting soon began. The constant turmoil virtually emptied the city of Babylon. A tablet dated 275 BC states that the inhabitants of Babylon were transported to Seleucia, where a palace and a temple (Esagila) were built. With this deportation, Babylon became insignificant as a city, although more than a century later, sacrifices were still performed in its old sanctuary. =Renewed Persian rule= Under the Parthian and Sassanid Empires, Babylon (like Assyria) became a province of these Persian Empires for nine centuries, until after AD 650\\\\. It maintained its own culture and people, who spoke varieties of Aramaic, and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon. Examples of their culture are found in the Babylonian Talmud, the Gnostic Mandaean religion, Eastern Rite Christianity and the religion of the philosopher Mani. Christianity was introduced to Mesopotamia in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, and Babylon was the seat of a Bishop of the Church of the East until well after the Arab/Islamic conquest. =Muslim conquest= In the mid-7th century, Mesopotamia was invaded and settled by the expanding Muslim Empire, and a period of Islamization followed. Babylon was dissolved as a province and Aramaic and Church of the East Christianity eventually became marginalized. Ibn Hauqal mentions a small village called Babel in the tenth century; subsequent travelers describe only ruins. Babylon is mentioned in medieval Arabic writings as a source of bricks,Olof Peders√©n, \\"Excavated and Unexcavated Libraries in Babylon\\", in Cancik-Kirschbaum et al. (2011), pp. 47‚Äì67. said to have been used in cities from Baghdad to Basra.Julian E. Reade, \\"Disappearance and rediscovery\\"; in Finkel & Seymour, eds., Babylon (2009); pp. 13‚Äì30. European travelers in many cases could not discover the city's location, or mistook Fallujah for it. Benjamin of Tudela, a 12th-century traveller, mentions Babylon but it is not clear if he went there. Others referred to Baghdad as Babylon or New Babylon and described various structures encountered in the region as the Tower of Babel. Pietro della Valle found the ancient site in the 17th century and noted the existence of both baked and dried mudbricks cemented with bitumen. Modern era Lion of Babylon The eighteenth century saw an increasing flow of travelers to Babylon, including Carsten Niebuhr and Pierre-Joseph de Beauchamp, as well as measurements of its latitude. Beauchamp's memoir, published in English translation in 1792, provoked the British East India Company to direct its agents in Baghdad and Basra to acquire Mesopotamian relics for shipment to London. =Excavation and research= Claudius Rich, working for the East India Company in Baghdad, excavated Babylon in 1811‚Äì12 and again in 1817.Claudius J.

Henry Rawlinson and George Smith worked there briefly in 1854. The next excavation was conducted by Hormuzd Rassam on behalf of the British Museum. Work began in 1879, continuing until 1882, and was prompted by widespread looting of the site. Using industrial scale digging in search of artifacts, Rassam recovered a large quantity of cuneiform tablets and other finds.

The site was officially protected and excavated by the Kingdom of Iraq under British Administration, which later became the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq, and its successors: the Arab Federation, the Iraqi Republic, Ba'athist Iraq (also officially called the Iraqi Republic), and the Republic of Iraq. Babylonian images periodically appear on Iraqi postcards and stamps. In the 1960s, a replica of the Ishtar Gate and a reconstruction of Ninmakh Temple were built on site. On 14 February 1978, the Ba'athist government of Iraq under Saddam Hussein began the \\"Archaeological Restoration of Babylon Project\\": reconstructing features of the ancient city atop its ruins. These features included the Southern Palace of Nebuchandnezzar, with 250 rooms, five courtyards, and a 30-meter entrance arch. The project also reinforced the Processional Way, the Lion of Babylon, and an amphitheater constructed in the city's Hellenistic era. In 1982 the government minted a set of seven coins displaying iconic features of Babylon. A Babylon International Festival was held in September 1987, and annually thereafter until 2002 (excepting 1990 and 1991), to showcase this work. Proposed reconstruction of the Hanging Gardens and the great ziggurat never took place.John Curtis, \\"The Site of Babylon Today\\"; in Finkel & Seymour, eds., Babylon (2009); pp. 213‚Äì220.John Curtis, \\"The Present Condition of Babylon\\"; in Cancik-Kirschbaum et al. (2011).Paul Lewis, \\"Babylon Journal; Ancient King's Instructions to Iraq: Fix My Palace\\" (archive), New York Times, 19 April 1989. Hussein installed a portrait of himself and Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance to the ruins and inscribed his name on many of the bricks, in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar. One frequent inscription reads: \\"This was built by Saddam Hussein, son of Nebuchadnezzar, to glorify Iraq\\". These bricks became sought after as collectors' items after Hussein's downfall.\\"Saddam removed from ancient Babylon 'brick by brick'\\", ABC News 20 April 2003. Similar projects were conducted at Nineveh, Nimrud, Assur and Hatra, to demonstrate the magnificence of Arab achievement. When the 1991 Gulf War ended, Hussein wanted to build a modern palace called Saddam Hill over some of the old ruins, in the pyramidal style of a ziggurat. In 2003, he intended the construction of a cable car line over Babylon, but plans were halted by the 2003 invasion of Iraq. =US and Polish occupation= US Marines in front of the rebuilt ruins of Babylon, 2003 thumb Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the area around Babylon came under the control of US troops, before being handed over to Polish forces in September 2003. US forces under the command of General James T. Conway of the I Marine Expeditionary Force were criticized for building the military base \\"Camp Alpha\\", with a helipad and other facilities on ancient Babylonian ruins during the Iraq War. US forces have occupied the site for some time and have caused irreparable damage to the archaeological record. In a report of the British Museum's Near East department, Dr. John Curtis described how parts of the archaeological site were levelled to create a landing area for helicopters, and parking lots for heavy vehicles. Curtis wrote of the occupation forces: A US Military spokesman claimed that engineering operations were discussed with the \\"head of the Babylon museum\\". The head of the Iraqi State Board for Heritage and Antiquities, Donny George, said that the \\"mess will take decades to sort out\\" and criticised Polish troops for causing \\"terrible damage\\" to the site.Heritage News from around the world , World Heritage Alert!. Retrieved April 19, 2008. Poland resolved in 2004 to place the city under Iraq control, and commissioned a report titled Report Concerning the Condition of the Preservation of the Babylon Archaeological Site, which it presented at a meeting on 11‚Äì13 December 2004. In 2005 the site was handed over to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture. In April 2006, Colonel John Coleman, former Chief of Staff for the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, offered to issue an apology for the damage done by military personnel under his command. However, he also claimed that the US presence had deterred far greater damage by other looters.Cornwell, Rupert.

On July 5, 2019, the site of Babylon was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Cultural importance Woodcut in 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle depicting the fall of Babylon. William Simpson ‚Äì influenced by early archaeological investigations. Before modern archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia, the appearance of Babylon was largely a mystery, and typically envisioned by Western artists as a hybrid between ancient Egyptian, classical Greek, and contemporary Ottoman culture.Liverani 2016, pp. 21‚Äì22. \\"In practice, the solution adopted to visualize cities which were in fact unknown was a mixture of classical (Greek) and Egyptian elements, with long colonnades, even built on more than one level‚Äîwhich will then prove totally foreign to the unfired brick architecture of Mesopotamian cities‚Äîand with plenty of obelisks and the odd sphinx. To this mixture is added, often and willingly, something of Ottoman architecture, showing cupolas and minarets, clearly useful in picturing an unchangeable Near East which therefore needed to retain elements of remote antiquity in a modern age.\\" Due to Babylon's historical significance as well as references to it in the Bible, the word \\"Babylon\\" in various languages has acquired a generic meaning of a large, bustling diverse city. Examples include: * Babylon is used in reggae music as a concept in the Rastafari belief system, denoting the materialistic capitalist world: it refers equally to the British Empire which engineered the slave trade and to the modern oppressive governments of the USA and her allies, as they are considered to be one and the same imperialist evil. It's believed that the Babylon actively seeks to exploit and oppress the people of the world, especially people of African descent. It's believed that the Babylon forbids the smoking of ganja because this sacred herb opens men's minds to the truth. * Freemasonry, which has its own versions of biblical legends, classically considered Babylon as its birthplace and a haven for science and knowledge.Albert Mackey, History of Freemasonry (Vol. 1); New York and London: Masonic History Company, 1898/1906; p. 61. * Babylon 5 ‚Äì a science fiction series set on a futuristic space station that acts as a trading and diplomatic nexus between many different cultures. Many stories focus on the theme of different societies and cultures uniting, respecting differences, and learning from each other rather than fighting or looking on each other with prejudice and suspicion. * Babylon A.D. takes place in New York City, decades in the future. * Babilonas (Lithuanian name for \\"Babylon\\") ‚Äì a real estate development in Lithuania. *Babylon - a song by Lady Gaga which uses allusions to Ancient Biblical themes to discuss gossip =Biblical narrative= In the Book of Genesis (), Babel (Babylon) is described as founded by Nimrod along with Uruk, Akkad and perhaps Calneh‚Äîall of them in Shinar (\\"Calneh\\" is now sometimes translated not as a proper name but as the phrase \\"all of them\\"). Another story is given in Genesis 11, which describes a united human race, speaking one language, migrating to Shinar to establish a city and tower‚Äîthe Tower of Babel. God halts construction of the tower by scattering humanity across the earth and confusing their communication so they are unable to understand each other in the same language. Babylon appears throughout the Hebrew Bible, including several prophecies and in descriptions of the destruction of Jerusalem and subsequent Babylonian captivity, most of which are found in the Book of Daniel. These include the episode of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and Belshazzar's feast. Consequently, in Jewish tradition, Babylon symbolizes an oppressor against which righteous believers must struggle. In Christianity, Babylon symbolizes worldliness and evil. Prophecies sometimes symbolically link the kings of Babylon with Lucifer. Nebuchadnezzar II, sometimes conflated with Nabonidus, appears as the foremost ruler in this narrative. The Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible refers to Babylon many centuries after it ceased to be a major political center. The city is personified by the \\"Whore of Babylon\\", riding on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns, and drunk on the blood of the righteous. Some scholars of apocalyptic literature believe this New Testament \\"Babylon\\" to be a dysphemism for the Roman Empire.Merrill Tenney: New Testament Survey, Inter- varsity Press, 1985, pp383 See also * Cities of the ancient Near East * Jehoiachin's Rations Tablets * List of Kings of Babylon * Tomb of Daniel  Notes  References = Sources = * Cancik-Kirschbaum, Eva, Margarete van Ess, & Joachim Marzahn, eds.

They come from the planet Kashyyyk and are taller and stronger than most humans. The most prominent Wookiee is Chewbacca, co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon alongside Han Solo. Inspiration According to an interview with creator George Lucas, the inspiration for the Wookiee was Lucas' dog, Indiana (whose name is used in the Lucas-inspired Indiana Jones movies). \\"He was the prototype for the Wookiee. He always sat beside me in the car. He was big, a big bear of a dog.\\" During the climactic chase scene in THX 1138, one of the robotic cops, voiced by actor Terry McGovern, improvises: \\"I think I ran over a Wookiee back there\\", and thus the word was born. Wookey was the surname of a friend of Terry's, Ralph Wookey, and Terry thought it would be a funny in-joke to include his friend's name in the soundtrack for THX-1138. In one episode of Animal Planet's series Animal Icons, focusing on the creation of Star Wars figures, it was revealed that the Wookiees were also based on orangutans and lemurs, which are long-haired creatures that live in a hot forest climate. The net effect in terms of the Wookiees' appearance is a marked resemblance to descriptions of the legendary Sasquatch of the Pacific Northwest. Depiction =Physical characteristics= Adult Wookiees are typically taller than most humans, averaging . They possess enormous strength; Solo states that a Wookiee can pull a man's arms out of his sockets if angered or slighted, and in books and comics no humanoid species is shown to equal a Wookiee in pure strength. Wookiees have a keen sense of smell, are fully covered with a thick coat of hair, have good hand‚Äìeye coordination, and are shown to be excellent marksmen. Wookiees have been shown in many diverse environments, such as those of Hoth, Tatooine and Endor, never wearing any protective clothing or showing any signs of discomfort. Wookiees have a lifespan of several hundred years. =Culture= Wookiees are devoted, loyal friends and are very distrustful of strangers. Life debt is sacred to them. Despite a fearsome appearance and temperamental disposition, Wookiees are very intelligent and are very adept at handling advanced technology. Chewbacca is co-pilot of and performs maintenance on the Millennium Falcon, and also possesses a working knowledge of robotics, managing to haphazardly reassemble C-3PO after he was destroyed by Imperial stormtroopers in The Empire Strikes Back. Wookiees are fast learners; Chewbacca commandeers an Imperial AT-ST during the Battle of Endor and is shown effectively maneuvering the vehicle and operating its weapons systems. Wookiees greatly value morality, courage, compassion, and loyalty. A sacred and ancient Wookiee tradition is that of the honor family. An honor family comprises a Wookiee's closest friends and companions. These family members pledge a commitment to lay down their lives for one another, as well as members of any honor families these individuals may have. Like the similarly sacred Wookiee life debt, Wookiees are willing to extend this tradition to members outside their species. Chewbacca considered Han Solo, Leia Organa Solo, their children, and Luke Skywalker part of his honor family. Wookiees have an understanding of Star Wars- universe warfare and fought alongside Republic forces during the Clone Wars. Wookiees were betrayed and enslaved shortly after that conflict, as well as on certain occasions during the war by the Separatist Alliance. Some Wookiees are sensitive to the Force. One such Wookiee is Lowbacca, Chewbacca's nephew, from the book series Young Jedi Knights, although that story is no longer considered canon. Some Wookiees are also prominent and successful bounty hunters, such as Black Krrsantan, due to their strength and ferocity. =Language= The most common Wookiee language is Shyriiwook. However, other dialects used by native Wookiees from Kashyyyk are Thykarann and Xaczik. Wookiees are capable of understanding Galactic Basic, but generally none are able to speak it because of the structure of Wookiee vocal cords. In the original Star Wars trilogy, it seems that Chewbacca can understand humans. His human partner, Han Solo, also shows knowledge of Shyriiwook, or can at least understand Chewbacca; in Solo it is shown that Han does indeed have the ability to speak Shyriiwook at a rudimentary level. In the Star Wars expanded universe novels, Chewbacca builds a miniature translator droid (\\"Em Teedee\\") for his nephew Lowbacca when he later begins training as a Jedi, to facilitate communications with his fellow students. =Weapons= In the Star Wars films, Chewbacca carries a bowcaster, the traditional weapon developed and used by Wookiees. Bowcasters launch quarrels, which are crossbow bolts that through magnetic propulsion appear as elongated blaster bolts due to their velocity. The propulsion technique gives the quarrels extremely high stopping power. Chewbacca in particular is shown to be an excellent shot, killing a Stormtrooper who was attempting to escape on a speeder bike in Return of the Jedi. The spring that powers the bowcaster is extremely hard to pull back; humans are generally incapable of cocking a bowcaster, although Han Solo was seen to do so. Home planet Kashyyyk (), also known as Wookiee Planet C, is a fictional planet in the Star Wars universe. It is the tropical, forested home world of the Wookiees. In the original scripts for Return of the Jedi, the Second Death Star was to be built in orbit around Kashyyyk by Wookiee slave labor, with the primitive Wookiees ultimately helping the rebels to fight off the Imperial garrison. However, Lucas decided that since the Wookiee Chewbacca, being co-pilot and mechanic on the Millennium Falcon, was clearly proficient with advanced technology, it would be confusing to show the Wookiees with a primitive, \\"stone age\\" culture. Endor and the Ewoks were created instead to serve this purpose.Interviews with George Lucas in Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy, documentary included in the Bonus Materials DVD of the boxed set of the \\"second\\" trilogy of films. Out of print. ASIN B00003CXCT Lucas has also said that he originally planned Yavin IV, the location of the rebel base in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, to be the Wookiee home planet, but subsequent rewrites changed this to Kashyyyk. =In media= ;Films Kashyyyk was first seen in the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), as the program's frame story takes place there, with the backdrop of the planet being taken directly from concept art by Ralph Mcquarrie. In the Holiday Special, the first mention of the planet carries the pronunciation \\"ka-ZOOK\\". The planet was more extensively seen in Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith, in which Jedi Master Yoda goes to Kashyyyk to aid the Wookiees in their battle against the Droid Army. In Revenge of the Sith the Wookiees live in the lush forests and giant jungles on the planet, in villages among the giant wroshyr trees. Phuket, Thailand was used for main photography, while the backdrops for Kashyyyk were filmed in Guilin, a city in southern China, which is famous for its karst formations. ;Books The planet's unique biosphere was first detailed in The Wookiee Storybook. The planet was revealed to be a densely forested planet, on which one can encounter vast plains and island areas suitable for large, sweeping battles. It was in this book that the family of Chewbacca once again appears in a situation similar to that of the Holiday Special. The planet appears in several other books, as well. Among them are: * A Forest Apart by Troy Denning * The Han Solo Trilogy, by Ann C. Crispin. While the reader actually visits Kashyyyk for the first time in Book Three (\\"Rebel Dawn\\"), we hear about it (and meet Chewbacca) in Book Two, \\"The Hutt Gambit\\". * The Black Fleet Crisis trilogy by Michael P. Kube-McDowell * Heir to the Empire by Timothy Zahn * the Young Jedi Knights series * the New Jedi Order series by various authors ;Comics Kashyyyk also features in issue #91 of the Marvel Comics Star Wars and in the newspaper comic strip \\"The Kashyyyk Depths\\", by artist Russ Manning. In the \\"Chewbacca\\" comic series, set during the New Jedi Order era, many scenes are set on Kashyyyk as well. It is written as 'Kazhyyk' in Way of the Wookiee! in the Marvel Illustrated Books. November 1981. ;Video games Kashyyyk also appears in the video games Star Wars: Galaxies, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds, Star Wars: Battlefront, Star Wars: Battlefront II, Star Wars: Republic Commando, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars: Empire at War, Lego Star Wars: The Video Game, Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game), and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The latter takes place 4000 years before the Galactic Empire, with the Wookiees being oppressed by the slavers of Czerka Corporation. In addition, Kashyyyk appears in the 2019 video game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. ;Theme park attraction Kashyyyk also appears in the various Disney theme parks attraction Star Tours - The Adventures Continue. =Fictional history= ;Early days In the millennia before the rise of the Galactic Republic, Kashyyyk was a member world of the Infinite Empire. Its surface was terraformed by the Rakata, resulting in the abnormally large foliage which still covers the planet's surface in modern times. Its ecology can be politely described as a \\"layered deathtrap\\", the planet's surface being encompassed in shadow by wroshyr trees that are many miles high. The dangerous and hostile animals increase closer to the forest floor. Hidden on the planet's surface is a Star Map, another piece in the puzzle of the location of the Star Forge. ;Czerka Corporation and slavery When Kashyyyk was discovered by the Czerka Corporation's explorers, around 4,000 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin), it was given the catalogue name G5-623, sometimes known as Edean. Czerka conducted extensive Wookiee-slaving operations on \\"Edean\\", as well as hunting several of its species almost to extinction. To ensure a relatively peaceful presence, Czerka supported the installation of friendly chieftains into power over the native tribes and would then prop them up with mercenaries and weapons shipments. In response, the chieftains would train their tribe to understand Galactic Basic (ostensibly to \\"know thine enemy\\" but in reality to make them better slaves) and allow Czerka to enslave a percentage of the tribe's population. Eventually Czerka was driven out by Revan and rebel Wookiees. ;The Clone Wars During the epic Clone Wars of 22 to 19 years BBY, Kashyyyk fought on the side of the Galactic Republic. During one such battle, Yoda of the Jedi Council flew to Kashyyyk to assist in the fighting. This particular battle, known as the Battle of Kashyyyk, would be one of the last few battles fought in the Clone Wars before the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. During this battle, Order 66 was initiated and Commander Gree, along with an unidentified Clone Scout Trooper, attempted to kill Yoda. The clone duo failed to kill the Jedi master and they were both decapitated. Yoda later escaped with the help from his friends and prominent Wookiees, Chewbacca and Tarfful. After this, the clones successfully defended the planet from Separatist advances. Quinlan Vos (who survived, but was wounded) was on Kashyyyk during Order 66, as was Luminara Unduli (who was killed by Commander Faie). Also, unknown to some, just before Order 66 was given, an elite squad of clones known as Delta Squad had arrived, delaying the Separatist forces advance on Kashyyyk, before the arrival of Republic reinforcements. ;The \\"Dark Times\\" During the period of the Galactic Empire's reign, Kashyyyk, like all other planets in the galaxy, was forced into obeying the policies of the Empire. On one such occasion, following the destruction of the first Death Star, the Empire, under the direction of Darth Vader, went on a search for the rebels responsible. Kashyyyk was put under a blockade, along with Tatooine, in an attempt to locate Han Solo and Chewbacca. It was on a day when Chewbacca was returning home to his family to celebrate the sacred Wookiee holiday of Life Day that the Empire raided Chewie's home. They did not find him. Darth Vader also discovers his secret apprentice Galen Marek while raiding Kashyyyk in The Force Unleashed. On another such occasion, the Rebel Alliance, before the destruction of the first Death Star, attempted to raid the planet with Han Solo. The plan is to free the Wookiee population from enslavement. The Empire stops them. Han Solo flees in the Millennium Falcon. ;The New Republic Following the defeat of the Empire, Kashyyyk joined the New Republic and its successor state the Galactic Alliance, formed by the leaders of the Rebel Alliance. In the novel Inferno, large portions of Kashyyyk are destroyed in retaliation for their acceptance of several Jedi who opposed Darth Caedus's regime.  Notable Wookiees  Chewbacca is the loyal friend and first mate of Han Solo, and serves as co-pilot on Solo's spaceship, the Millennium Falcon. Gungi is a male Wookiee who is training to be a Jedi. Gungi appears in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Gungi was trained by Ahsoka Tano and was in the top of his class. Lowbacca is a Jedi knight and the nephew of Chewbacca. He studied at Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum and was a companion of Jaina Solo. He wielded a bronze-bladed lightsaber. \\"Let the Wookiee win\\" In A New Hope, when Chewbacca is upset after losing a game of dejarik (a game similar to chess) against R2-D2, Han Solo says \\"It's not wise to upset a Wookiee...droids don't pull people's arms out of their sockets when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that\\". In response C-3PO says \\"I suggest a new strategy, R2: let the Wookiee win\\".\\"Is It Easy Being Green?\\": Writing the New College Application Essay, Justin Nevin, Sourcebooks Inc., Sep 18, 2014, page 18The 12 Principles of Pyong'hwa: Pathways and Perspectives for More Peace and Tranquility in Life, Steev Ramsdell, Balboa Press, 2012 ,page 194 This phrase (sometimes referred to by its initialism LTWWFoxTales: Behind the Scenes at Fox Software, Kerry Nietz, Hentzenwerke, 2004, page 170) has gained the proverbial meaning of \\"In trivial disputes, let the person who cares more have their way.\\" It can also be interpreted as advice to avoid arguments, especially those with shallow motivation such as to appear more intelligent than one's opponent.

Life The son and grandson of booksellers, Fr√®re's father, Jacques- Christophe operated a significant and almost a century-old library on the port of Rouen.A description can be found in Dibdin's A bibliographical, antiquarian and picturesque tour in France and Germany, 1821. Despite having received an education that gave him access to all the liberal professions, Fr√®re's family background gave him a strong taste for books to which he remained faithful until his death. He succeeded his father in 1827 at the family library, and was, from 1827 to 1842, one of those applied and learned booksellers who was of assistance both to letters and its servants. He carried on the traditions of Rouen's most renowned publishers by publishing major works, all related to Normandy, without having misgivings about the considerable sacrifices to his wealth. He repeatedly called on Eustache Hyacinthe Langlois's refined and delicate hand to provide artwork for these books, for he liked his style and loved to encourage his talent. Once he felt his own erudition was up to par, he thought his turn to engage in writing had come as well. Being passionate about Normandy's traditions and local history as he was, he knew about those subjects as much as could the publisher who, for many years, had successfully brought out the most notable publications about all things Norman. In 1842, Fr√®re sold his library to Lebrument, and he definitely entered scholarship, bringing out very erudite articles on various elements of Norman history, focusing notably on booksellers and old books in a row. After he published these successful local studies, Fr√®re engaged in his opus magnum, the monumental Manuel du Bibliographe normand. It was the outcome of a vast research and information gathered from several Norman scholars, which took him five years to complete. This book answered perfectly the expectations promised by its title. Fr√®re owes the better part of his literary and bibliographical notoriety to this work, which ended in every scholar's hands. Fr√®re was appointed in 1846, recording secretary at the Chamber of Commerce in Rouen. There, he was instrumental to the maritime and industrial trade of his region. Members of the Chamber of Commerce appreciated his extensive training, consistent application, discernment and spirit of wisdom, and they like liked to put his knowledge and experience into service. The depth of his knowledge and the seriousness of his work in 1869 led him to fill in Louis Bouilhet's post as director of the municipal library of Rouen, left vacant by his death. During the few years that Fr√®re spent there, he worked as hard he always did throughout his life. After he was admitted at the Acad√©mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de Rouen in 1845, Fr√®re became one of the most frequent and most arduous, augmenting, each year, its pr√©cis or its archives with meritorious works universally recognized as thought-provoking. His research on the early days of printing in Normandy, his note on printing and bookselling in Rouen in the 15th and 16th centuries, his considerations on the origins of typography, a complete history of printing in Normandy, the Catalogue raisonn√© des manuscrits normands de la Biblioth√®que de Rouen, etc. all go to show the range of Fr√®re's fondness for all book related subjects. This attention was not undivided though, as he ventured, on occasion, into the literary field, publishing the Fragments litt√©raires de Jeanne Grey, a note on French and English minstrels, on Scandinavian literature, a page on the history of the Palinods. This last publication marked his last year as president of the Academy of Rouen, a position he has held since 1867. In 1869, the Rouen government entrusted him with the preservation of its rich and extensive municipal library. Fr√®re, at once started completing its catalog and review, by increasing the number of notes. Fr√®re never knew a moment's respite, in his life of seventy-six years, because death caught him when he had just finished printing the Catalogue des manuscrits de la Biblioth√®que municipale de Rouen, relatifs √† la Normandie.

Elevation of a private home in Plovdiv, by Architect Kamen Petkov, dated 1914. Kamen Petkov (Bulgarian: –ö–∞–º–µ–Ω –ü–µ—Ç–∫–æ–≤) was a Bulgarian architect based in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Biography Arch. Kamen Petkov was born in 1863 in the small village Beloptichene (today Ruzhintsi) Belogradchishko, son of Petko Simeonov. After completing high school in Vratsa, completed his military service and worked for several years as a teacher. He had a desire to study in the Academy of Arts. At that time, scholarships for this school not leave because it was considered that Bulgaria it need more builders - engineers and architects. Thus, in 1892, Kamen Petkov goes to study architecture as a government scholar at the Polytechnic of Karlsruhe, Germany, where he graduated in 1896. After graduation, he returned to Bulgaria and began working in Vratsa, Vidin and some time in Sofia where together with the artist Alexander Bozhilov and other take part in the Circle \\"Bulgaria\\". In 1898 he moved to Plovdiv, loves the city and worked there for 47 years until his death on February 17, 1945. Career Arch. Kamen Petkov (1863, the region of Belogradchik, north-west of Sofia - 1945, Plovdiv) graduated from the Technical University of Karlsruhe (TH), Germany in 1896. Back in Bulgaria he worked for a short spell in Sofia where he collaborated, together with the painter Alexander Bozhinov –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—ä—Ä –ë–æ–∂–∏–Ω–æ–≤, in the ‚ÄúBalgaran‚Äù group. In 1898 he established his practice in Plovdiv and worked there for 47 years till his death in 1945. He designed and built more than 800 buildings in Plovdiv alone. Most of them still shape the specific architecture of the city centre. Ten exquisite buildings can be seen along the Main Street alone, beginning with the powerful impact of the Bulgarian Bank (1898), and followed by smaller elegant buildings very much influenced by the Vienna Secession architects. Their fa√ßades are lavishly decorated with fluted pilasters crowned with composite capitals; arched windows articulated by decorative columns, curvilinear ornaments and many other elegant details. Plant-inspired motifs such as blossoming small trees, ornamental garlands, festoons of flowers, etc., disclose a strong Art Nouveau influence.–°–µ—Ü–µ—Å–∏–æ–Ω—ä—Ç –∏ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∞.

In the French girls college, 1915 and boys college, 1932 respectively, however, he opted for a drastic geometric design. The contrasting frames of the shallow- arched windows and the dark highly stylized stucco pilasters create a strong graphic effect. The four- and six-floor high tobacco warehouses are among Petkov's biggest works. The mansard above the main cornice is supported by massive consoles. Fluted risers articulate the large volumes into proportionate shapes. The design is an excellent mature integration of the functional and aesthetic aspects of a building for the industry. In his early seventies Kamen Petkov won a competition organised by the Vatican among Bulgarian and Italian architects for the reconstruction and building of several Catholic churches in the region of Plovdiv which had been severely damaged in an earthquake in 1928. Thus he came to design the frontal part and the interior of the largest Catholic cathedral in the Balkan peninsula. This time he draws on the Italian neoclassicism. The main facade is very elaborate with six pairs of columns articulating the ground floor and four pairs above them emphasise the main entrance. Two cornices form the base of the front√≥n which is flanked by the statues of St. Peter and St. Paul and decorated with stylised floral forms. The Tobacco Warehouses in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, built between 1925 and 1932. Of the Catholic churches built by Kamen Petkov around Plovdiv, the ones in the villages of Gen. Nikolaevo and Sekirovo are the largest with capacity for 2000 people. Both are designed as three-nave basilicas with two bell towers and a front√≥n in between. The fa√ßades are elaborately decorated with columns and pilasters, plastic cornices and stucco ornaments. During his long creative life Kamen Petkov left numerous lovingly designed buildings in a Bulgarian strain of the Art Nouveau movement which renders evident the ample extent and diversity of this ground-breaking phenomenon.See this 1903 blueprint for a private home, kept at the Plovdiv city archives. Works By the time Arch. Kamen Petkov arrived in Plovdiv, there already worked one more arch. Joseph Schnitter, with whom he became friends, Arch. M. Pernigoni with whom participated in the design of several buildings architect. Andronikos and arch. A. Torniov that leaving the city wrote in the local newspaper that \\"... is calm, because here he will be replaced by arch. Kamen Petkov ... \\". In 1903 in Plovdiv Arch. Kamen Petkov married Radka Georgieva Popova, the daughter of a socially prominent Georgi Popov from city Tryavna- associate of Vasil Levski and member of its revolutionary committee. From their marriage were born four children - a daughter - musical pedagogue, one more daughter - philologists, and two sons - a journalist and an architect. His son Arch. George K. Petkov (1917-1991) as an architect also devotes his entire life to Plovdiv. His grandson Arch. Kamen Petkov (1950-1993) also designed and built in Plovdiv until his premature death. Now as an architect in Plovdiv works grandson Kamen Petkov, Arch. Georgi Petkov K. (1973 -). Only in Plovdiv Arch. Kamen Petkov designed and built about 800 buildings. Moreover, his work are the houses of Orozov and Shipkov in city Kazanlak (later used for the Town Council), the house of Dr. T. Vitanov in city Vidin (subsequently used for the Youth House), the Bulgarian National Bank in city Burgas. Pretty houses in Plovdiv are already demolished - Samokovlieva house, demolished during the construction of the tunnel under Nebet, house Kalchev, replacing the Party House and many others - one torn down for new construction, others collapsed the time. Some designed by the architect. K. Petkov buildings require distinctly in the architectural appearance of the city. They still mark the major ensembles of the center and outlines the architectural skeleton of Plovdiv after the Liberation. Building technology in the late 19th and early 20th century By the time Arch. K. Petkov begins work, the walls of the buildings were always massive - foundations and cellar of stonework and up bearing brick walls. Inter-floor structures are almost always wooden beams or iron beams profile \\"double T\\" filled with flat brick arches (Prussian vault). The roofs are always wooden, covered with tiles (very rarely sheet). This method of performance is underlying one-man design - the architect was the sole author of the building and has solved all architectural and structural issues including trending calculations. With the advent of reinforced concrete in construction after 1930 calculations begin to make an engineer-constructor. Here appears the question of details - doors, windows, mostly plaster and stucco, which abound in architectural sculpture of the Arch. Kamen Petkov. Often it was impossible in advance all the details to be drawn - it happened on the construction site, by hand drawings and instructions of the designer with some experience of the contractor, as the architect had the obligation and the right to require several samples to select it Find the best and appropriate. Also a big role in the construction played and craftsmen, contractors details - plasterers, carpenters and blacksmiths that the architect himself has selected and who knew his tastes and requirements and could only a sketch to understand the thought and desire of the author. They fulfilled with craft experience, without him having to produce countless drawings. For example, the project for the building of Jewish charity, \\"Shalom alaikum\\" is located on one single sheet, size 60/80 cm, but in comparison with the project executed building differences were not detected. What could not be shown in the drawing was explained very thorough and clarified during the author's supervision. However, the building is not poor in details. Similar is the case with the project for a residential building on E. Kondodimo the main street No.9. Beautiful facade with its exquisite wrought iron railings not mapped detail. The same applies to the building on the street. \\"R. Daskalov \\"5 whose details drapery decorative pilasters, hand-painted by the artist in the area. 1: 1 for many years were kept in his home. The system of sole design (only architect) divides the year into two periods - in winter designs and draws, and in summer guided construction. Catholic churches and Catholic Cathedral in Plovdiv In adulthood Architect Kamen Petkov gets achieving a major task - with funds granted by the Vatican as an aid for victims of the great earthquake in 1928, the Catholic population in Plovdiv and around the villages. To carry out the design of several projects: restoration of the Catholic cathedral \\"St. Ludwig\\"; Catholic school\\" St. Andrew\\"; and the Catholic Diocese, all three in Plovdiv. Also Catholic churches in the villages of General Nikolaevo; Sekirovo, Belozem Parchevich and Borets. Arch Petkov received that task after winning a competition among several Bulgarian and Italian architects. The jury is done in the Vatican. Catholic cathedral \\"St. Ludwig\\" in Plovdiv was originally built during the time of Monsignor (Bishop) Andrea Canova from 1850 to 1861 when illuminated. The architect and builder are unknown. During the earthquake the church suffered greatly - broken main facade with two small towers on both sides, in which nearly died Papal Nuncio Monsignor Roncalli, who later became pope under the name John XXIII. The earthquake becomes peak Easter lunch. In 1929-1930, the architect. Petkov design new front facade in the spirit of Italian neoclassicism. Once the main facade was restored in 1931, the cathedral is lit in 1932, the roof burned, some of the remaining walls are destroyed and requires the building to be renovated. This time arch. Petkov develops its whole interior while retaining the main lines and parts of the foundations of the basilica and directs the work mainly to the interior. Over bulk is newly poured concrete slab cassette and over it was built wooden roof covered with tiles. The church was buried queen Maria Luisa, mother of King Boris III. Over the sarcophagus was placed portrait statue of the queen of white marble. The sarcophagus and the statue are illuminated through stained with Bulgarian and Bourbon coat of arms. The belfry was built in 1902 by architect Mariano Pernigoni. Catholic Diocese of Plovdiv. After the earthquake in 1928, simultaneously with the restoration of the cathedral arch. Petkov designs and Metropolis, which is located next to it. Unlike the Catholic cathedral, bishop's palace is emphasized Sezession character [1]. School \\"St. Andrew \\"(subsequently School of landscaping) was built in 1931 as a third element in the composition. Catholic church, the village of General Nikolaev. Catholic church, village Sekirovo - completed in 1931 to winning the Vatican declined competition and several Catholic churches in villages near Plovdiv. The biggest of them are those in the villages of General Nikolaevo and Sekirovo - today districts of Rakovski. They are built on almost identical projects due to long-standing rivalry between the two villages, allow- one of the churches to greater or different, which could be interpreted as \\"more beautiful.\\" There is some difference in the facade. Are solved as a basilica holds about 2,000 worshipers with two square towers. Catholic church Belozem - completed in 1931. The church is smaller than that of General Nikolaevo, also with two towers that are more Bulgarian treatment - not Italian campaigns and octagonal vertical volumes. Catholic church, village Parchevich - completed in 1931, today the town of Rakovski. This church is considerably less than the previous three-aisled cruciform basilica with an octagonal tower above the main entrance. Catholic church, village Fighter - completed in 1931 and the project implementation are the same as those of the church in the village Parchevich. Uniate Church, Plovdiv - completed in 1931 basilica with clearly marked signs of Orthodox church construction. Stained glass project is Bulgarian artist, and implementation of colored glass and lead frames is done in France. Under the church there is a large crypt, where alongside the portraits of the Pope and Parchevich away and a portrait of the architect. Kamen Petkov. Recognition In 1930 Arch. Kamen Petkov, as an active member of IAC (Engineering and Architectural Association) and the 70th anniversary was awarded by the Ministry of Construction and Architecture with the \\"Civil Merit\\". In 1992, the Municipal Council of the city decided to name a street in his name. From 2012, the Vocational School of Architecture, Civil Engineering and Geodesy in Plovdiv also bears his name. For 60 years the Arch. Kamen Petkov designed and built for the City and many of his works can still be seen and illustrate creative searches in the development of modern Bulgarian architecture.

The Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia) was first founded by Ethiopian people in the Ethiopian Highlands. Due to migration and imperial expansion, it grew to include many other primarily Afro-Asiatic- speaking communities, including Oromos, Amhara, Somalis, Tigray, Afars, Sidama, Gurage, Agaw and Harari, among others. One of the early kingdoms to rise to power in the territory was the kingdom of D'mt in the 10th century BC, which established its capital at Yeha. In the first century AD the Aksumite Kingdom rose to power in the Tigray Region with its capital at Aksum and grew into a major power on the Red Sea, subjugating Yemen and Meroe and converting to Christianity in the early fourth century. The Aksumite empire fell into decline with the rise of Islam in the Arabian peninsula, which slowly shifted trade away from the Christian Aksum. It eventually became isolated, then economy slumped and Aksum's commercial domination of the region was over. The Aksumites gave way to the Zagwe Dynasty, who established a new capital at Lalibela before giving way to the Solomonic Dynasty in the 13th century. During the early Solomonic period, Ethiopia went through military reforms and imperial expansion that made it dominate the Horn of Africa. Portuguese missionaries arrived at this time. In 1529, the Adal Sultanate attempted to conquer Abyssinia and met initial success; the Adal were supplied by the Ottomans while Abyssinia received Portuguese reinforcements. By 1543, Abyssinia had recaptured lost territory but the war had weakened both sides. The Oromo people were able to expand into the highlands, conquering both the Adal Sultanate and Abyssinia. The Portuguese presence also increased, while the Ottomans began to push into what is now Eritrea, creating the Habesh Eyalet. The Portuguese brought modern weapons and baroque architecture to Ethiopia, and in 1622 converted the emperor Susenyos I to Catholicism, sparking a civil war which ended in his abdication and expulsion of all Catholics from Ethiopia. A new capital was established at Gondar in 1632, and a period of peace and prosperity ensued until the country was split apart by warlords in the 18th century during the Zemene Mesafint. Ethiopia was reunified in 1855 under Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history and his reign was followed by Yohannes IV who was killed in action in 1889. Under Menelik II Ethiopia started its transformation to well organized technological advancement and the structure that the country has now. Ethiopia also expanded to the south and east, through the conquest of the western Oromo (now Shoan Oromo), Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta and other groups, resulting in the borders of modern Ethiopia. Ethiopia defeated an Egyptian invasion in 1876 and an Italian invasion in 1896 which killed 17,000 Ethiopians, and came to be recognised as a legitimate state by European powers. A more rapid modernisation took place under Menelik II and Haile Selassie. Italy launched a second invasion in 1935. From 1935‚Äì1941, Ethiopia was under Italian occupation as part of Italian East Africa. A joint force of British and Ethiopian rebels managed to drive the Italians out of the country in 1941, and Haile Selassie was returned to the throne from his 5 years exiled in Britain. Ethiopia and Eritrea united in a federation, but when Haile Selassie ended the federation in 1961 and made Eritrea a province of Ethiopia, the 30-year Eritrean War of Independence broke out. Eritrea regained its independence after a referendum in 1993. Haile Selassie was overthrown in 1974 and the militaristic Derg Regime came to power. In 1977 Somalia invaded, trying to annex the Ogaden region, but were pushed back by Ethiopian, Soviet, and Cuban forces. In 1977 and 1978 the government tortured or killed hundreds of thousands of suspected enemies in the Red Terror. Ethiopia experienced famine in 1984 that killed one million people and civil war that resulted in the fall of the Derg in 1991. This resulted in the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic under Meles Zenawi. Ethiopia remains impoverished, but its economy has become one of the world's fastest-growing.

The discovery was made by Gerrard Dekker, a Dutch hydrologist, who found Acheulian stone tools that were over a million years old at Kella. Since then many important finds have propelled Ethiopia to the forefront of palaeontology. The oldest hominid discovered to date in Ethiopia is the 4.2 million year old Ardipithicus ramidus (Ardi) found by Tim D. White in 1994. The most well known hominid discovery is Lucy, found in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia's Afar region in 1974 by Donald Johanson, and is one of the most complete and best preserved, adult Australopithecine fossils ever uncovered. Lucy's taxonomic name, Australopithecus afarensis, means 'southern ape of Afar', and refers to the Ethiopian region where the discovery was made. Lucy is estimated to have lived 3.2 million years ago. There have been many other notable fossil findings in the country. In Gona stone tools were uncovered in 1992 that were 2.52 million years old, these are the oldest such tools ever discovered anywhere in the world. In 2010 fossilised animal bones, that were 3.4 million years old, were found with stone-tool-inflicted marks on them in the Lower Awash Valley by an international team, led by Shannon McPherron, which is the oldest evidence of stone tool use ever found anywhere in the world. In 2004 fossils found near the Omo river at Kibbish by Richard Leakey in 1967 were redated to 195,000 years old, the oldest date in East Africa for modern Homo sapiens. Homo sapiens idaltu, found in the Middle Awash in Ethiopia in 1997, lived about 160,000 years ago. Some of the earliest known evidence of early stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of Homo sapiens), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, and date to around 279,000 years ago. In 2019, further evidence of Middle Stone Age complex projectile weapons was found at Aduma, also in Ethiopia, dated 100,000-80,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers. Bronze Age contacts with Egypt Wall relief depicting an Egyptian expedition to the Land of Punt during the reign of Hatshepsut. The earliest records of Ethiopia appear in Ancient Egypt, during the Old Kingdom period. Egyptian traders from about 3000 BC refer to lands south of Nubia or Kush as Punt and Yam. The Ancient Egyptians were in possession of myrrh (found in Punt), which Richard Pankhurst interprets to indicate trade between the two countries was extant from Ancient Egypt's beginnings. Pharaonic records indicate this possession of myrrh as early as the First and Second dynasties (3100‚Äì2888 BC), which was also a prized product of the Horn of Africa Region; inscriptions and pictorial reliefs also indicate ivory, panther and other animal skins, myrrh-trees and ostrich feathers from the African coastal belt; and in the Fourth Egyptian Dynasty (2789‚Äì2767 BC) a Puntite is mentioned to be in the service of the son of Cheops, the builder of the Great Pyramid.Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to The End of the 18th century (Asmara: Red Sea Press, Inc., 1997), pp.4‚Äì5, https://books.google.com/books?id=zpYBD3bzW1wC J. H. Breasted posited that this early trade relationship could have been realized through overland trade down the Nile and its tributaries (i.e. the Blue Nile and Atbara). The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented seafaring among the early Egyptians: \\"During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries B. C., the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country.\\"Agatharchides, in Wilfred Harvey Schoff (Secretary of the Commercial Museum of Philadelphia) with a foreword by W.

The most famous expedition to Punt, however, comes during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut probably around 1495 BC, as the expedition was recorded in detailed reliefs on the temple of Deir el- Bahri at Thebes. The inscriptions depict a trading group bringing back myrrh trees, sacks of myrrh, elephant tusks, incense, gold, various fragmented wood, and exotic animals. Detailed information about these two nations is sparse, and there are many theories concerning their locations and the ethnic relationship of their peoples. The Egyptians sometimes called the Land of Punt, \\"God's-Land\\", due to the \\"large quantities of gold, ivory, and myrrh that could be easily obtained\\".Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands: Essays in Regional History from Ancient Times to The End of the 18th century (Asmara: Red Sea Press, Inc., 1997), p.4, https://books.google.com/books?id=zpYBD3bzW1wC.

Reference to the Kingdom of Aksum designated as Ethiopia dates only as far back as the first half of the 4th century CE following the 4th century CE invasion of Kush in Sudan by the Aksumite empire. Earlier inscription of Ezana Habashat (the source for \\"Abyssinia\\") in Ge'ez, South Arabian alphabet, was then translated in Greek as \\"Aethiopia\\". The state of Sheba which is mentioned in the Old Testament is sometimes believed to have been in Ethiopia, but it is more often placed in Yemen. According to the Ethiopian narrative, best represented in the Kebra Nagast, the Queen of Sheba slept with King Solomon and bore a child named Ebn Melek (later Emperor Menelik I). When he was of age, Menelik returned to Israel to see his father, who sent with him the son of Zadok to accompany him with a replica of the Ark of the Covenant (Ethiosemitic: tabot). On his return with some of the Israelite priests, however, he found that Zadok's son had stolen the real Ark of the Covenant. Some believe the Ark is still being preserved today at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum, Ethiopia. The tradition that the biblical Queen of Sheba was a ruler of Ethiopia who visited King Solomon in Jerusalem in ancient Israel is supported by the 1st century AD Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, who identified Solomon's visitor as a queen of Egypt and Ethiopia. =D ømt= Temple at Yeha, possible capital of D'mt. The first kingdom known to have existed in Ethiopia was the kingdom of D'mt, which rose to power around the 10th century BCE. Its capital was at Yeha, where a Sabaean style temple was built around 700 BCE. The D'mt kingdom was influenced by the Sabaeans in Yemen, however it is not known to what extent. While it was once believed that D'mt was a Sabaean colony, it is now believed that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappeared after a few decades or a century, perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of D ømt or some other proto-Aksumite state.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 57. Few inscriptions by or about this kingdom survive and very little archaeological work has taken place. As a result, it is not known whether D ømt ended as a civilization before Aksum's early stages, evolved into the Aksumite state, or was one of the smaller states united in the Aksumite kingdom possibly around the beginning of the 1st century.Uhlig, Siegbert (ed.), Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. p. 185. =Axum= King Ezana's Stele in Aksum. The first verifiable kingdom of great power to rise in Ethiopia was that of Axum in the 1st century CE. It was one of many successor kingdoms to D ømt and was able to unite the northern Ethiopian Highlands beginning around the 1st century BCE. They established bases on the northern highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and from there expanded southward. The Persian religious figure Mani listed Axum with Rome, Persia, and China as one of the four great powers of his time. The origins of the Axumite Kingdom are unclear, although experts have offered their speculations about it. Even who should be considered the earliest known king is contested: although Carlo Conti Rossini proposed that Zoskales of Axum, mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, should be identified with one Za Haqle mentioned in the Ethiopian King Lists (a view embraced by later historians of Ethiopia such as Yuri M. KobishchanovYuri M. Kobishchanov, Axum, Joseph W. Michels, editor; Lorraine T. Kapitanoff, translator, (University Park, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania, 1979), pp.54‚Äì59. and Sergew Hable Sellasie), G.W.B. Huntingford argued that Zoskales was only a sub-king whose authority was limited to Adulis, and that Conti Rossini's identification can not be substantiated.Expressed, for example, in his The Historical Geography of Ethiopia (London: the British Academy, 1989), p.39. Inscriptions have been found in southern Arabia celebrating victories over one GDRT, described as \\"nagashi of Habashat [i.e. Abyssinia] and of Axum.\\" Other dated inscriptions are used to determine a floruit for GDRT (interpreted as representing a Ge'ez name such as Gadarat, Gedur, Gadurat or Gedara) around the beginning of the 3rd century CE. A bronze scepter or wand has been discovered at Atsbi Dera with an inscription mentioning \\"GDR of Axum\\". Coins showing the royal portrait began to be minted under King Endubis toward the end of the 3rd century CE. Gold coin of the Aksumite King Ousas Christianity was introduced into the country by Frumentius, who was consecrated first bishop of Ethiopia by Saint Athanasius of Alexandria about 330 CE. Frumentius converted Ezana, who left several inscriptions detailing his reign both before and after his conversion. One inscription found at Axum, states that he conquered the nation of the Bogos, and returned thanks to his father, the god Mars, for his victory. Later inscriptions show Ezana's growing attachment to Christianity, and Ezana's coins bear this out, shifting from a design with disc and crescent to a design with a cross. Expeditions by Ezana into the Kingdom of Kush at Meroe in Sudan may have brought about its demise, though there is evidence that the kingdom was experiencing a period of decline beforehand. As a result of Ezana's expansions, Aksum bordered the Roman province of Egypt. The degree of Ezana's control over Yemen is uncertain. Though there is little evidence supporting Aksumite control of the region at that time, his title, which includes king of Saba and Salhen, Himyar and Dhu-Raydan (all in modern-day Yemen), along with gold Aksumite coins with the inscriptions, \\"king of the Habshat\\" or \\"Habashite\\", indicate that Aksum might have retained some legal or actual footing in the area.Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 81. Toward the close of the 5th century CE, a great company of monks known as the Nine Saints are believed to have established themselves in the country. Since that time, monasticism has been a power among the people, and not without its influence on the course of events. An Aksumite palace at Dungur The Axumite Kingdom is recorded once again as controlling part - if not all - of Yemen in the 6th century CE. Around 523 CE, the Jewish king Dhu Nuwas came to power in Yemen and, announcing that he would kill all the Christians, attacked an Aksumite garrison at Zafar, burning the city's churches. He then attacked the Christian stronghold of Najran, slaughtering the Christians who would not convert. Emperor Justin I of the Eastern Roman empire requested that his fellow Christian, Kaleb, help fight the Yemenite king, and around 525 CE, Kaleb invaded and defeated Dhu Nuwas, appointing his Christian follower Sumuafa' Ashawa' as his viceroy. This dating is tentative, however, as the basis of the year 525 CE for the invasion is based on the death of the ruler of Yemen at the time, who very well could have been Kaleb's viceroy. Procopius records that after about five years, Abraha deposed the viceroy and made himself king (Histories 1.20). Despite several attempted invasions across the Red Sea, Kaleb was unable to dislodge Abreha, and acquiesced in the change; this was the last time Ethiopian armies left Africa until the 20th century CE when several units participated in the Korean War. Eventually Kaleb abdicated in favor of his son Wa'zeb and retired to a monastery, where he ended his days. Abraha later made peace with Kaleb's successor and recognized his suzerainty. Despite this reverse, under Ezana and Kaleb the kingdom was at its height, benefiting from a large trade, which extended as far as India and Ceylon, and were in constant communication with the Byzantine Empire. Details of the Axumite Kingdom, never abundant, become even more scarce after this point. The last king known to mint coins is Armah, whose coinage refers to the Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 CE. An early Muslim tradition is that the Negus Sahama offered asylum to a group of Muslims fleeing persecution during Muhammad's life (615 CE), but Stuart Munro-Hay believes that Axum had been abandoned as the capital by thenStuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, p.56. - although Kobishchanov states that Ethiopian raiders plagued the Red Sea, preying on Arabian ports at least as late as 702 CE.Kobishchanov, Axum, p.116. Some people believed the end of the Axumite Kingdom is as much of a mystery as its beginning. Lacking a detailed history, the kingdom's fall has been attributed to a persistent drought, overgrazing, deforestation, plague, a shift in trade routes that reduced the importance of the Red Sea‚Äîor a combination of these factors. Munro-Hay cites the Muslim historian Abu Ja'far al-Khwarazmi/Kharazmi (who wrote before 833 CE) as stating that the capital of \\"the kingdom of Habash\\" was Jarma. Unless Jarma is a nickname for Axum (hypothetically from Ge'ez girma, \\"remarkable, revered\\"), the capital had moved from Axum to a new site, yet undiscovered.Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum, pp.95‚Äì98. Middle Ages =Zagwe Dynasty= Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, the Zagwe dynasty King credited with having constructed the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela. About 1000 (presumably c. 960, though the date is uncertain), a non-Christian princess, Yodit (\\"Gudit\\", a play on Yodit meaning \\"evil\\"), conspired to murder all the members of the royal family and establish herself as monarch. According to legends, during the execution of the royals, an infant heir of the Axumite monarch was carted off by some faithful adherents and conveyed to Shewa, where his authority was acknowledged. Concurrently, Yodit reigned for forty years over the rest of the kingdom and transmitted the crown to her descendants. Though parts of this story were most likely made up by the Solomonic Dynasty to legitimize its rule, it is known that a female ruler did conquer the country about this time. At one point during the next century, the last of Yodit's successors were overthrown by an Agaw lord named Mara Takla Haymanot, who founded the Zagwe dynasty (named after the Agaw people who ruled during this time) and married a female descendant of the Aksumite monarchs (\\"son-in- law\\") or previous ruler. Exactly when the new dynasty came to power is unknown, as is the number of kings in the dynasty. The new Zagwe dynasty established its capital at Roha (also called Adeffa), where they build a series of monolithic churches. These structures are traditionally ascribed to the King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, with the city being renamed Lalibela in his honour; though in truth some of them were built before and after him. The architecture of the Zagwe shows a continuation of earlier Aksumite traditions, as can be seen at Lalibela and at Yemrehana Krestos Church. The building of rock-hewn churches, which first appeared in the late Aksumite era and continued into the Solomonic dynasty, reached its peak under the Zagwe. The Zagwe dynasty controlled a smaller area than the Aksumites or the Solomonic dynasty, with its core in the Lasta region. The Zagwe seem to have ruled over a mostly peaceful state with a flourishing urban culture, in contrast to the more warlike Solomonids with their mobile capitals. David Buxton remarked that the Zagwe achieved 'a degree of stability and technical advancement seldom equalled in Abyssinian history'. The church and state were very closely linked, and they may have had a more theocratic society than the Aksumites or Solomonids, with three Zagwe kings being canonized as saints and one possibly being an ordained priest. Foreign affairs Unlike the Aksumites, the Zagwe were very isolated from the other Christian nations, although they did maintain a degree of contact through Jerusalem and Cairo. Like many other nations and denominations, the Ethiopian Church maintained a series of small chapels and even an annex at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.Erlich, Haggai. The Cross and the River; Ethiopia, Egypt and the Nile. Boulder: Lynne Rienne Publishers, 2002. p.41‚Äì43 Saladin, after retaking the Holy City in 1187, expressly invited the Ethiopian monks to return and even exempted Ethiopian pilgrims from the pilgrim tax. His two edicts provide evidence of Ethiopia's contact with these Crusader States during this period.Erlich, p. 37. It was during this period that the Ethiopian king Gebre Mesqel Lalibela ordered the construction of the legendary rock-hewn churches of Lalibela. Later, as the Crusades were dying out in the early fourteenth century, the Ethiopian Emperor Wedem Arad dispatched a thirty-man mission to Europe, where they travelled to Rome to meet the Pope and then, since the Medieval Papacy was in schism, they travelled to Avignon to meet the Antipope. During this trip, the Ethiopian mission also travelled to France, Spain and Portugal in the hopes of building an alliance against the Muslim states then threatening Ethiopia's existence. Plans were even drawn up of a two-pronged invasion of Egypt with the French King, but nothing ever came of the talks, although this brought Ethiopia back to Europe's attention, leading to expansion of European influence when the Portuguese explorers reached the Indian Ocean.Pankhurst, Richard. The Ethiopians, A History. Malden: Blackwell Publishers, Inc, 1998. p.77‚Äì85. =Early Solomonic period (1270‚Äì1529)= Lebna Dengel, n…ôgus√§ n√§g√§st (Emperor) of Ethiopia and a member of the Solomonic dynasty. Around 1270, a new dynasty was established in the Abyssinian highlands under Yekuno Amlak, with aid from neighboring Makhzumi Dynasty deposed the last of the Zagwe kings and married one of his daughters. According to legends, the new dynasty were male- line descendants of Aksumite monarchs, now recognized as the continuing Solomonic dynasty (the kingdom being thus restored to the biblical royal house). This legend was created to legitimize the Solomonic dynasty and was written down in the 14th century in the Kebra Negast, an account of the origins of the Solomonic dynasty. Under the Solomonic dynasty, the chief provinces became Tigray (northern), what is now Amhara (central) and Shewa (southern). The seat of government, or rather of overlordship, had usually been in Amhara or Shewa, the ruler of which, calling himself n…ôgus√§ n√§g√§st, exacted tribute, when he could, from the other provinces. The title of n…ôgus√§ n√§g√§st was to a considerable extent based on their alleged direct descent from Solomon and the queen of Sheba; but it is needless to say that in many, if not in most, cases their success was due more to the force of their arms than to the purity of their lineage. Under the early Solomonic dynasty Ethiopia engaged in military reforms and imperial expansion which left it dominating the Horn of Africa, especially under the rule of Amda Seyon I. There was also great artistic and literary advancement at this time, but also a decline in urbanisation as the Solomonic emperors didn't have any fixed capital, but rather moved around the empire in mobile camps. Under the early Solomonic dynasty monasticism grew strongly. The abbot Abba Ewostatewos created a new order called the Ewostathians who called for reforms in the church, including observance of the Sabbath, but was persecuted for his views and eventually forced into exile, eventually dying in Armenia. His zealous followers, also persecuted, formed isolated communities in Tigray. The movement grew strong enough that the emperor Dawit I, after first trying to crush the movement, legalized their observance of the Sabbath and proselytization of their faith. Finally under Zara Yaqob a compromise was made between the new Egyptian bishops and the Ewostathians at the Council of Mitmaq in 1450, restoring unity to the Ethiopian church. Relations with Europe and \\"Prester John\\" An interesting side-effect of Ethiopian Christianity was the way it intersected with a belief that had long prevailed in Europe of the existence of a Christian kingdom in the far east, whose monarch was known as Prester John. Originally thought to have been in the Orient, eventually the search for Prester John's mythical kingdom focused on Africa and particularly, the Christian empire in Ethiopia. This was first noticed when Zara Yaqob sent delegates to the Council of Florence in order to establish ties with the papacy and Western Christianity. They were confused when they arrived and council prelates insisted on calling their monarch Prester John, trying to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, the delegates' admonitions did little to stop Europeans from referring to the monarch as their mythical Christian king, Prester John.Silverberg, Robert, The Realm of Prester John, Ohio University Press, 1996 (paperback edition) , p. 189 Towards the close of the 15th century the Portuguese missions into Ethiopia began. Among others engaged in this search was P√™ro da Covilh√£, who arrived in Ethiopia in 1490, and, believing that he had at length reached the far-famed kingdom, presented to the n…ôgus√§ n√§g√§st of the country (Eskender at the time) a letter from his master the king of Portugal, addressed to Prester John. Covilh√£ would establish positive relations between the two states and go on to remain there for many years. In 1509, Empress Dowager Eleni, the underage Emperor's regent, sent an Armenian named Matthew to the king of Portugal to request his aid against the Muslims. In 1520, the Portuguese fleet, with Matthew on board, entered the Red Sea in compliance with this request, and an embassy from the fleet visited the Emperor, Lebna Dengel, and remained in Ethiopia for about six years. One of this embassy was Father Francisco √Ålvares, who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the country. The Abyssinian-Adal War (1529‚Äì1543) Sultan of Adal (right) and his troops battling King Yagbea-Sion and his men during the Abyssinian-Adal War Between 1528 and 1540, the Adal Sultanate attempted, under Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi, to conquer the Ethiopian Empire. Entering, from the low country to the south-east, and overran much of the Ethiopian plateau, forcing the Emperor to take refuge in the mountain fastnesses. In this remote location, the ruler again turned to the Portuguese. Jo√£o Bermudes, a subordinate member of the mission of 1520, who had remained in the country after the departure of the embassy, was sent to Lisbon. Bermudes claimed to be the ordained successor to the Abuna (archbishop), but his credentials are disputed. In response to Bermudes message, a Portuguese fleet under the command of Est√™v√£o da Gama, was sent from India and arrived at Massawa in February 1541. Here he received an ambassador from the Emperor beseeching him to send help against the Muslims, and in the July following a force of 400 musketeers, under the command of Crist√≥v√£o da Gama, younger brother of the admiral, marched into the interior, and being joined by native troops were at first successful against the enemy; but they were subsequently defeated at the Battle of Wofla (28 August 1542), and their commander captured and executed. The 120 surviving Portuguese soldiers fled with Queen Mother Seble Wongel and regrouped with Ethiopian forces led by the Emperor to enact several defeats on the Adal over late 1542 and early 1543. On February 21, 1543, Al-Ghazi was shot and killed in the Battle of Wayna Daga and his forces were totally routed. After this, quarrels arose between the Emperor and Bermudes, who had returned to Ethiopia with Gama and now urged the emperor to publicly profess his obedience to Rome. This the Emperor refused to do, and at length Bermudes was obliged to make his way out of the country. =Oromo Movements= The Oromo migrations were a series of expansions in the 16th and 17th centuries by the Oromo people from southern areas of Ethiopia to more northern regions. The migrations had a severe impact on the Solomonic dynasty of Abyssinia, as well as being the death blow to the recently defeated Adal Sultanate. The migrations concluded in around 1710, when the Oromo conquered the kingdom of Ennarea in the Gibe region. In the 17th century, Ethiopian emperor Susenyos I relied on Oromo support to gain power, and married an Oromo woman. While initial relations between the Oromo and Amhara were cordial, conflict erupted after the emperor tried to convert the Oromo to Christianity. Many Oromo entered in emperor Susenyos' domain in response. In the 17th and 18th centuries, much of the Oromo people gradually underwent conversion to Islam, especially around Harar, Arsi and Bale. The Oromo Muslims regarded the Imam of Harar as their spiritual guide, while retaining some of their original culture and socio-political organisation. Scholars believe the Oromo converted to Islam as a means of preserving their identity and a bulwark against assimilation into Ethiopia. By late 17th century, the Oromo had friendly relations with the Amharas. So when emperor Iyasu I tried to attack the Oromo, he was convinced by local Amharic rulers to back down. The Oromo also formed political coalitions with previously subdued people of Ethiopia, including the Sidama people and the locals of Ennarea, Gibe and Kingdom of Damot. Gondarine Period Gondar as a third permanent capital (after Aksum and Lalibela) of the Christian Kingdom was founded by Fasiladas in 1636. It was the most important center of commerce for the Kingdom.Grade 9th History text =Early Gondar period (1632‚Äì1769)= The Royal Enclosure (Fasil Ghebbi) of Gondar. The Jesuits who had accompanied or followed the Gama expedition into Ethiopia, and fixed their headquarters at Fremona (near Adwa), were oppressed and neglected, but not actually expelled. In the beginning of the 17th century Father Pedro P√°ez arrived at Fremona, a man of great tact and judgment, who soon rose into high favour at court, and won over the emperor to his faith. He directed the erection of churches, palaces and bridges in different parts of the country, and carried out many useful works. His successor Afonso Mendes was less tactful, and excited the feelings of the people against him and his fellow Europeans. Upon the death of Emperor Susenyos and accession of his son Fasilides in 1633, the Jesuits were expelled and the native religion restored to official status. Fasilides made Gondar his capital and built a castle there which would grow into the castle complex known as the Fasil Ghebbi, or Royal Enclosure. Fasilides also constructed several churches in Gondar, many bridges across the country, and expanded the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Aksum. During this time of religious strife Ethiopian philosophy flourished, and it was during this period that the philosophers Zera Yacob and Walda Heywat lived. Zera Yaqob is known for his treatise on religion, morality, and reason, known as Hatata. Aussa Sultanate State flag of the Aussa Sultanate. The Sultanate of Aussa (Afar Sultanate) succeeded the earlier Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Harari city-state. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne.Abir, p. 23 n.1. The Sultanate was subsequently re-established by Kedafu around the year 1734, and was thereafter ruled by his Mudaito Dynasty.Abir, pp. 23‚Äì26. The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver baton, which was considered to have magical properties.Trimingham, p. 262. =Zemene Mesafint= This era was, on one hand, a religious conflict between settling Muslims and traditional Christians, between nationalities they represented, and, on the other hand, between feudal lords on power over the central government. Some historians date the murder of Iyasu I, and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty, as the beginning of the Ethiopian Zemene Mesafint (\\"Era of the Princes\\"), a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords. Warriors in Abyssinia Nobles came to abuse their positions by making emperors, and encroached upon the succession of the dynasty, by candidates among the nobility itself: e.g. on the death of Emperor Tewoflos, the chief nobles of Ethiopia feared that the cycle of vengeance that had characterized the reigns of Tewoflos and Tekle Haymanot I would continue if a member of the Solomonic dynasty were picked for the throne, so they selected one of their own, Yostos to be negusa nagast (king of kings) ‚Äì however his tenure was brief. Iyasu II ascended the throne as a child. His mother, Empress Mentewab played a major role in Iyasu's reign, as well as her grandson Iyoas too. Mentewab had herself crowned as co-ruler, becoming the first woman to be crowned in this manner in Ethiopian history. Empress Mentewab was crowned co-ruler upon the succession of her son (a first for a woman in Ethiopia) in 1730, and held unprecedented power over government during his reign. Her attempt to continue in this role following the death of her son 1755 led her into conflict with Wubit (Welete Bersabe), his widow, who believed that it was her turn to preside at the court of her own son Iyoas. The conflict between these two queens led to Mentewab summoning her Kwaran relatives and their forces to Gondar to support her. Wubit responded by summoning her own Oromo relatives and their considerable forces from Yejju. The treasury of the Empire being allegedly penniless on the death of Iyasu, it suffered further from ethnic conflict between nationalities that had been part of the Empire for hundreds of years‚Äîthe Agaw, Amharans, Showans, and Tigreans‚Äîand the Oromo newcomers. Mentewab's attempt to strengthen ties between the monarchy and the Oromo by arranging the marriage of her son to the daughter of an Oromo chieftain backfired in the long run. Iyasu II gave precedence to his mother and allowed her every prerogative as a crowned co- ruler, while his wife Wubit suffered in obscurity. Wubit waited for the accession of her own son to make a bid for the power wielded for so long by Mentewab and her relatives from Qwara. When Iyoas assumed the throne upon his father's sudden death, the aristocrats of Gondar were stunned to find that he more readily spoke in the Oromo language rather than in Amharic, and tended to favor his mother's Yejju relatives over the Qwarans of his grandmothers family. Iyoas further increased the favor given to the Oromo when adult. On the death of the Ras of Amhara, he attempted to promote his uncle Lubo governor of that province, but the outcry led his advisor Wolde Leul to convince him to change his mind. It is believed that the power struggle between the Qwarans led by the Empress Mentewab, and the Yejju Oromos led by the Emperor's mother Wubit was about to erupt into an armed conflict. Ras Mikael Sehul was summoned to mediate between the two camps. He arrived and shrewdly maneuvered to sideline the two queens and their supporters making a bid for power for himself. Mikael settled soon as the leader of Amharic- Tigrean (Christian) camp of the struggle. The reign of Iyaos' reign becomes a narrative of the struggle between the powerful Ras Mikael Sehul and the Oromo relatives of Iyoas. As Iyoas increasingly favored Oromo leaders like Fasil, his relations with Mikael Sehul deteriorated. Eventually Mikael Sehul deposed the Emperor Iyoas (7 May 1769). One week later, Mikael Sehul had him killed; although the details of his death are contradictory, the result was clear: for the first time an Emperor had lost his throne in a means other than his own natural death, death in battle, or voluntary abdication. Mikael Sehul had compromised the power of the Emperor, and from this point forward it lay ever more openly in the hands of the great nobles and military commanders. This point of time has been regarded as one start of the Era of the Princes. An aged and infirm imperial uncle prince was enthroned as Emperor Yohannes II. Ras Mikael soon had him murdered, and underage Tekle Haymanot II was elevated to the throne. This bitter religious conflict contributed to hostility toward foreign Christians and Europeans, which persisted into the 20th century and was a factor in Ethiopia's isolation until the mid-19th century, when the first British mission, sent in 1805 to conclude an alliance with Ethiopia and obtain a port on the Red Sea in case France conquered Egypt. The success of this mission opened Ethiopia to many more travellers, missionaries and merchants of all countries, and the stream of Europeans continued until well into Tewodros's reign. This isolation was pierced by very few European travellers. One was the French physician C.J. Poncet, who went there in 1698, via Sennar and the Blue Nile. After him James Bruce entered the country in 1769, with the object of discovering the sources of the Nile, which he was convinced lay in Ethiopia. Accordingly, leaving Massawa in September 1769, he travelled via Axum to Gondar, where he was well received by Emperor Tekle Haymanot II. He accompanied the king on a warlike expedition round Lake Tana, moving South round the eastern shore, crossing the Blue Nile (Abay) close to its point of issue from the lake and returning via the western shore. Bruce subsequently returned to Egypt at the end of 1772 by way of the upper Atbara, through the kingdom of Sennar, the Nile, and the Korosko desert. During the 18th century the most prominent rulers were the emperor Dawit III of Gondar (died May 18, 1721), Amha Iyasus of Shewa, who consolidated his kingdom and founded Ankober, and Tekle Giyorgis of Amhara ‚Äì the last-mentioned is famous as having been elevated to the throne altogether six times and also deposed six times. The first years of the 19th century were disturbed by fierce campaigns between Ras Gugsa of Begemder, and Ras Wolde Selassie of Tigray, who fought over control of the figurehead Emperor Egwale Seyon. Wolde Selassie was eventually the victor, and practically ruled the whole country till his death in 1816 at the age of eighty. Dejazmach Sabagadis of Agame succeeded Wolde Selassie in 1817, through force of arms, to become warlord of Tigre.  Modern  = 1855‚Äì1936 = Under the Emperors Tewodros II (1855‚Äì1868), Yohannes IV (1872‚Äì1889), and Menelek II (1889‚Äì1913), the empire began to emerge from its isolation. Under Emperor Tewodros II, the \\"Age of the Princes\\" (Zemene Mesafint) was brought to an end.  Tewodros II and Tekle Giyorgis II (1855‚Äì1872)  Emperor Tewodros II's rule is often placed as the beginning of modern Ethiopia, ending the decentralized Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Princes). Emperor Tewodros (or Theodore) II was born Lij Kassa in Qwara, in 1818. His father was a small local chief, and his relative (possibly uncle) Dejazmach Kinfu was governor of the provinces of Dembiya, Qwara and Chelga between Lake Tana and the northwestern frontier. Kassa lost his inheritance upon the death of Kinfu while he was still a young boy. After receiving a traditional education in a local monastery, he went off to lead a band of bandits that roved the country in a Robin Hood-like existence. His exploits became widely known, and his band of followers grew steadily until he led a formidable army. He came to the notice of the ruling Regent, Ras Ali, and his mother Empress Menen Liben Amede (wife of the Emperor Yohannes III). In order to bind him to them, the Empress arranged for Kassa to marry Ali's daughter. He turned his attention to conquering the remaining chief divisions of the country, Gojjam, Tigray and Shewa, which still remained unsubdued. His relations with his father-in-law and grandmother-in-law deteriorated however, and he soon took up arms against them and their vassals, and was successful. Map of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in the 19th century. On February 11,1855, Kassa deposed the last of the Gondarine puppet Emperors, and was crowned negusa nagast of Ethiopia under the name of Tewodros II. He soon after advanced against Shewa with a large army. Chief of the notables opposing him was its king Haile Melekot, a descendant of Meridazmach Asfa Wossen. Dissensions broke out among the Shewans, and after a desperate and futile attack on Tewodros at Dabra Berhan, Haile Melekot died of illness, nominating with his last breath his eleven-year-old son as successor (November 1855) under the name Negus Sahle Maryam (the future emperor Menelek II). Darge, Haile Melekot's brother, and Ato Bezabih, a Shewan noble, took charge of the young prince, but after a hard fight with Angeda, the Shewans were obliged to capitulate. Sahle Maryam was handed over to the Emperor Tewodoros and taken to Gondar. He was trained there in Tewodros's service, and then placed in comfortable detention at the fortress of Magdala. Tewodoros afterwards devoted himself to modernizing and centralizing the legal and administrative structure of his kingdom, against the resistance of his governors. Sahle Maryam of Shewa was married to Tewodros II's daughter Alitash. In 1865, Sahle Maryam escaped from Magdala, abandoning his wife, and arrived in Shewa, and was there acclaimed as Negus. Tewodros forged an alliance between Britain and Ethiopia, but as explained in the next section, he committed suicide after a military defeat by the British. On the death of Tewodros, many Shewans, including Ras Darge, were released, and the young Negus of Shewa began to feel himself strong enough, after a few preliminary minor campaigns, to undertake offensive operations against the northern princes. However, these projects were of little avail, for Ras Kassai of Tigray had by this time (1872) risen to supreme power in the north. Proclaiming himself negusa nagast under the name of Yohannes IV (or John IV), he forced Sahle Maryam to acknowledge his overlordship. In early 1868, the British force seeking Tewodros‚Äô surrender, after he refused to release imprisoned British subjects, arrived on the coast of Massawa. The British and Dajazmach Kassa came to an agreement in which Kassa would let the British pass through Tigray (the British were going to Magdala which Tewodros had made his capital) in exchange for money and weapons. Surely enough, when the British completed their mission and were leaving the country, they rewarded Kassa for his cooperation with artillery, muskets, rifles, and munitions, all in all worth approximately ¬£500,000.Marcus 2002, pp. 71‚Äì72 This formidable gift came in handy when in July 1871 the current emperor, Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II, attacked Kassa at his capital in Adwa, for Kassa had refused to be named a ras or pay tribute.Marcus, H. 2002, 72 Although Kassa's army was outnumbered 12,000 to the emperor's 60,000, Kassa's army was equipped with more modern weapons and better trained. At battle's end, forty percent of the emperor's men had been captured. The emperor was imprisoned and would die a year later. Six months later on 21 January 1872, Kassa became the new emperor under the name Yohannes IV.Zewde, B. 2001, 43 Abyssinia depicted on map before 1884 Berlin Conference to divide Africa. Menelik II  Yohannes IV (1872‚Äì1889)  Ethiopia was never colonized by a European power, but was occupied by Italians in 1936 (see below); however, several colonial powers had interests and designs on Ethiopia in the context of the 19th-century \\"Scramble for Africa.\\"Yohannes IV: emperor of Ethiopia When Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom, in 1867 failed to answer a letter Tewodros II of Ethiopia had sent her, he took it as an insult and imprisoned several British residents, including the consul. An army of 12,000 was sent from Bombay to Ethiopia to rescue the captured nationals, under the command of Sir Robert Napier. The Ethiopians were defeated, and the British stormed the fortress of Magdala (now known as Amba Mariam) on April 13, 1868. When the Emperor heard that the gate had fallen, he fired a pistol into his mouth and killed himself. Sir Robert Napier was raised to the peerage, and given the title of Lord Napier of Magdala. The Italians now came on the scene. Asseb, a port near the southern entrance of the Red Sea, had been bought from the local sultan in March 1870 by an Italian company, which, after acquiring more land in 1879 and 1880, was bought out by the Italian government in 1882. In this year Count Pietro Antonelli was dispatched to Shewa in order to improve the prospects of the colony by treaties with Sahle Maryam of Shewa and the sultan of Aussa. In 1887 Menelik king of Shewa invaded the Emirate of Harar after his victory at the Battle of chelenqo. In April 1888 the Italian forces, numbering over 20,000 men, came in contact with the Ethiopian army, but negotiations took the place of fighting, with the result that both forces retired, the Italians only leaving some 5,000 troops in Eritrea, later to become an Italian colony. Meanwhile, Emperor Yohannes IV had been engaged with the dervishes, who had in the meantime become masters of the Egyptian Sudan, and in 1887 a great battle ensued at Gallabat, in which the dervishes, under Zeki Tumal, were beaten. But a stray bullet struck the king, and the Ethiopians decided to retire. The king died during the night, and his body fell into the hands of the enemy (March 9, 1889). When the news of Yohannes's death reached Sahle Maryam of Shewa, he proclaimed himself emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia, and received the submission of Begemder, Gojjam, the Yejju Oromo, and Tigray.  Menelik II (1889‚Äì1913)  Ethiopia in 1908, according to a Rand McNally map On May 2 of that same year, Emperor Menelik signed the Treaty of Wuchale with the Italians, granting them a portion of Northern Ethiopia, the area that would later be Eritrea and part of the province of Tigray in return for the promise of 30,000 rifles, ammunition, and cannons.Pakenham, The Scramble for Africa, pp. 472‚Äì3 The Italians notified the European powers that this treaty gave them a protectorate over all of Ethiopia. Menelik protested, showing that the Amharic version of the treaty said no such thing, but his protests were ignored. On March 1, 1896, Ethiopia's conflict with the Italians, the First Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War, was resolved by the complete defeat of the Italian armed forces at the Battle of Adowa. A provisional treaty of peace was concluded at Addis Ababa on October 26, 1896, which acknowledged the independence of Ethiopia. Menelik granted the first railway concession, from the coast at Djibouti (French Somaliland) to the interior, to a French company in 1894. The railway was completed to Dire Dawa, from Harrar, by the last day of 1902. Under the reign of Menelik, beginning in the 1880s, Ethiopia set off from the central province of Shoa, to incorporate 'the lands and people of the South, East and West into an empire'. The people incorporated were the western Oromo (non Shoan Oromo), Sidama, Gurage, Wolayta and other groups.International Crisis Group, \\"Ethnic Federalism and its Discontents\\". Issue 153 of ICG Africa report (4 September 2009) p. 2. He began expanding his kingdom to the south and east, expanding into areas that had never been under his rule, resulting in the borders of Ethiopia of today. He did this with the help of Ras Gobena's Shewan Oromo militia. During the conquest of the Oromo, the Ethiopian Army carried mass atrocities against the Oromo population including mass mutilation, mass killings and large-scale slavery.Conquest, Tyranny, and Ethnocide against the Oromo: A Historical Assessment of Human Rights Conditions in Ethiopia, ca. 1880s‚Äì2002 by Mohammed Hassen, Northeast African Studies Volume 9, Number 3, 2002 (New Series)Genocidal violence in the making of nation and state in Ethiopia by Mekuria Bulcha, African Sociological Review Some estimates for the number of people killed as a result of the conquest go into the millions.A.

It was widely practiced in the new territories, and tolerated by the authorities who often owned slaves themselves. Slaves could be bought and sold (but not to non-Christians), and had limited legal rights. They did have the right to worship, and the right not to have their families broken up by sales.Hanibal Goitom, \\"Ethiopian Emperors and Slavery\\" On Custodia Legis: Law Librarians of Congress January 31, 2012 Iyasu V, Zauditu and Haile Selassie (1913‚Äì1936) Iyasu V (Lij Iyasu), Emperor of Ethiopia from 1913 to 1916. When Menelik II died, his grandson, Lij Iyassu, succeeded to the throne but soon lost support because of his Muslim ties. He was deposed in 1916 by the Christian nobility, and Menelik's daughter, Zauditu, was made empress. Her cousin, Ras Tafari Makonnen, was made regent and successor to the throne. Upon the death of Empress Zauditu in 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen, adopting the throne name Haile Selassie, was crowned Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia. His full title was \\"His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, King of Kings of Ethiopia and Elect of God.\\" Following the death of Abba Jifar II of Jimma, Emperor Haile Selassie seized the opportunity to annex Jimma. In 1932, the Kingdom of Jimma was formally absorbed into Ethiopia. During the reorganization of the provinces in 1942, Jimma vanished into Kaffa Province. The abolition of slavery became a high priority for the Haile Selassie regime. international pressures forced action, and it was required for membership in the League of Nations. Final success was achieved by 1942.Hanibal Goitom, \\"Abolition of Slavery in Ethiopia\\" On Custodia Legis: Law Librarians of Congress February 14, 2012 =Educational modernization= Modernization became a priority for the Haile Selassie regime; it began with expanded education opportunities beyond the small old-fashioned schools run by the Ethiopian church. Menelik had founded the first modern school at Addis Ababa in 1908, and sent several students to Europe. Haile Selassie sent hundreds of young men and women to study abroad, set up the capital's second modern school in 1925. He established schools and a number of cities, as well as training institutions and technical schools.Amare Asgedom, \\"Higher education in pre-revolution Ethiopia: Relevance and academic freedom.\\" Ethiopian Journal of Higher Education 2.2 (2005): 1-45 online.Richard Pankhurst, \\"Education in Ethiopia during the Italian fascist occupation (1936-1941).\\" International Journal of African Historical Studies 5.3 (1972): 361-396. online Missionaries were also active in education. By 1925 French Franciscan sisters were well-established, running an orphanage, a dispensary, a leper colony and 10 schools with 350 girl students. They settled in the cities of Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, along the Franco-Ethiopian railway which opened in 1917. The schools were highly attractive to upper-class Ethiopians. In 1935, 119 Catholic and Protestant missions were educating 6717 pupils across the nation.Pierre Guidi, \\"‚ÄòFor good, God, and the Empire‚Äô: French Franciscan sisters in Ethiopia 1896‚àí1937.\\" History of Education 47.3 (2018): 384-398. online = Italian occupation (1936‚Äì1941) = Emperor Haile Selassie's reign was interrupted in 1935 when Italian forces invaded and occupied Ethiopia. The Italian army, under the direction of dictator Benito Mussolini, invaded Ethiopian territory on October 2, 1935. They occupied the capital Addis Ababa on May 5. Emperor Haile Selassie pleaded to the League of Nations for aid in resisting the Italians. Nevertheless, the country was formally annexed on May 9, 1936, and the Emperor went into exile. Many Ethiopians died in the invasion. The Negus claimed that more than 275,000 Ethiopian fighters were killed compared to only 1,537 Italians, while the Italian authorities estimated that 16,000 Ethiopians and 2,700 Italians (including Italian colonial troops) died in battle.Antonicelli, Franco. Trent'anni di storia italiana 1915‚Äì1945, p. 133. Some 78,500 patriots (guerrilla fighters) died during the occupation, 17,800 civilians were killed by aerial bombardment and 35,000 people died in concentration camps. Coat of Arms of the \\"Emperor of Ethiopia\\" Victor Emmanuel II War crimes were committed by both sides in this conflict. Italian troops used mustard gas in aerial bombardments (in violation of the Geneva Conventions) against combatants and civilians in an attempt to discourage the Ethiopian people from supporting the resistance. Deliberate Italian attacks against ambulances and hospitals of the Red Cross were reported.Rainer Baudendistel, Between bombs and good intentions: the Red Cross and the Italo-Ethiopian War, 1935‚Äì1936. Berghahn Books. 2006 pp. 239, 131‚Äì2 By all estimates, hundreds of thousands of Ethiopian civilians died as a result of the Italian invasion, including during the reprisal Yekatit 12 massacre in Addis Ababa, in which as many as 30,000 civilians were killed. Crimes by Ethiopian troops included the use of Dum-Dum bullets (in violation of the Hague Conventions), the killing of civilian workmen (including during the Gondrand massacre) and the mutilation of captured Eritrean Ascari and Italians (often with castration), beginning in the first weeks of war. Italy in 1936 requested the League of Nations to recognize the annexation of Ethiopia. All member nations (including Britain and France), with the exception of the Soviet Union, voted to support it.Antonicelli; p. 85 The King of Italy (Victor Emmanuel III) was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia and the Italians created an Italian empire in Africa (Italian East Africa) with Ethiopia, Eritrea and Italian Somalia, with its capital Addis Abeba.Italian Addis Abeba In 1937 Mussolini boasted that, with his conquest of Ethiopia, \\"finally Adua was avenged\\" and that he had abolished slavery in Ethiopia, a practice that existed in the country for centuries.Del Boca, Angelo. Italiani in Africa Orientale: La conquista dell'Impero, p.131. The Italians made investments in Ethiopian infrastructure development during their occupation. They created the so-called \\"imperial road\\" between Addis Ababa and Massaua.1940 Article on the special road Addis Ababa-Assab and map (in Italian) More than 900 km of railways were reconstructed, dams and hydroelectric plants were built, and many public and private companies were established. The Italian government abolished slavery, a practice that existed in the country for centuries. Much of these improvements were part of a plan to bring half a million Italians to colonize the Ethiopian plateaus.Antonicelli; p.106 In October 1939 the Italian colonists in Ethiopia numbered 35,441, of whom 30,232 male (85.3%) and 5,209 female (14.7%), most of them living in urban areas.Italian emigration in Etiopia (in Italian) Only 3,200 Italian farmers moved to colonize farm areas (mostly in the Shewa Governorate), where they were under sporadic attack by pro-Haile Selassie guerrillas until the end of 1938. The occupation government closed all schools operated by the Ethiopian church, or by missionaries. They were replaced with two new systems. There was a prestige operation for Italians, and rudimentary one for native Ethiopians. Textbooks featured the glory and power of Mussolini and promoted military careers. The natives were given a rudimentary primary education focused on producing submissive and obedient servants of the empire. New school buildings were constructed for the Italian colonists.Pankhurst, \\"Education in Ethiopia during the Italian fascist occupation (1936-1941).\\" (1972) pp. 361-396. The \\"Plan for development of Italian Addis Abeba\\" in 1939 proposed the creation of the first university in EthiopiaAddis abeba ¬´italiana¬ª: il Piano regolatore e la serie delle sue Varianti (1936-1939).‚ÄúMai-Ministero dell‚ÄôAfrica italiana (in Italian); pag. 63-126, but WW2 blocked it. = World War II = Haile Selassie's reign as emperor of Ethiopia is the best known and perhaps most influential in the nation's history. In spring 1941 the Italians were defeated by British and Allied forces (including Ethiopian forces). On May 5, 1941, Emperor Haile Selassie re-entered Addis Ababa and returned to the throne. The Italians, after their final stand at Gondar in November 1941, conducted a guerrilla war in Ethiopia, that lasted until summer 1943. After the defeat of Italy, Ethiopia annexed the former Italian colony of Eritrea. = Post‚ÄìWorld War II period (1941‚Äì1974) = Population in 1976 Ethiopia, when Eritrea was the fourteenth province. After World War II, Emperor Haile Selassie made numerous efforts to promote the modernization of his nation. The country's first important school of higher education, University College of Addis Ababa, was founded in 1950. The Constitution of 1931 was replaced with the 1955 constitution which expanded the powers of the Parliament. While improving diplomatic ties with the United States, Haile Selassie also sought to improve the nation's relationship with other African nations. To do this, in 1963, he helped to found the Organisation of African Unity. In 1961 the 30-year Eritrean Struggle for Independence began, following the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie I's dissolution of the federation and shutting down the Eritrean parliament. The Emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.Semere Haile The Origins and Demise of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Federation Issue: A Journal of Opinion, Vol. 15, 1987 (1987), pp. 9‚Äì17 The Negus suffered criticism due to the expenses involved in fighting the Nationalist forces. By the early 1970s Emperor Haile Selassie's advanced age was becoming apparent. As Paul B. Henze explains: \\"Most Ethiopians thought in terms of personalities, not ideology, and out of long habit still looked to Haile Selassie as the initiator of change, the source of status and privilege, and the arbiter of demands for resources and attention among competing groups.\\"Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 282. The nature of the succession, and of the desirability of the Imperial monarchy in general, were in dispute amongst the Ethiopian people. Perceptions of this war as imperialist were among the primary causes of the growing Ethiopian Marxist movement. In the early 1970s, the Ethiopian Communists received the support of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev. This help led to the 1974 marxist coup of Mengistu. The government's failure to effect significant economic and political reforms over the previous fourteen years created a climate of unrest. Combined with rising inflation, corruption, a famine that affected several provinces (especially Welo and Tigray) but was concealed from the outside world, and the growing discontent of urban interest groups, the country was ripe for revolution. The unrest that began in January 1974 became an outburst of general discontent. The Ethiopian military, with assistance from the Comintern, began to both organize and incite a full-fledged revolution. =Communist period (1974‚Äì1991)= High-ranking Derg members: Mengistu Haile Mariam, Teferi Benti and Atnafu Abate A tank in Addis Ababa after rebels seized the capital during the Ethiopian Civil War After a period of civil unrest that began in February 1974, a provisional administrative council of soldiers, known as the Derg (\\"committee\\"), seized power from the aging Emperor Haile Selassie I on September 12, 1974, and installed a government that was socialist in name and military in style. The Derg summarily executed 59 members of the former government, including two former Prime Ministers and Crown Councilors, Court officials, ministers, and generals. Emperor Haile Selassie died on August 22, 1975. He was allegedly strangled in the basement of his palace or smothered with a wet pillow.Martin Meredith, The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence (Public Affairs Publishing: New York, 2005) p. 217. Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam assumed power as head of state and Derg chairman, after having his two predecessors killed, as well as tens of thousands of other suspected opponents. The new Marxist government undertook socialist reforms, including nationalisation of landlords' propertyMartin Meredith, The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence, p. 244. and the church's property. Before the coup, Ethiopian peasants' way of life was thoroughly influenced by the church teachings; 280 days a year are religious feasts or days of rest. Mengistu's years in office were marked by a totalitarian-style government and the country's massive militarization, financed by the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, and assisted by Cuba. In December 1976, an Ethiopian delegation in Moscow signed a military assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. The following April 1977, Ethiopia abrogated its military assistance agreement with the United States and expelled the American military missions. The new regime in Ethiopia met with armed resistance from the large landowners, the royalists and the nobility. The resistance was largely centered in the province of Eritrea.Martin Meredith, The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence, p. 245. The Derg decided in November 1974 to pursue war in Eritrea rather than seek a negotiated settlement. By mid-1976, the resistance had gained control of most of the towns and the countryside of Eritrea.Martin Meredith, The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence, p. 245‚Äì246. In July 1977, sensing the disarray in Ethiopia, Somalia attacked across the Ogaden in pursuit of its irredentist claims to the ethnic Somali areas of Ethiopia (see Ogaden War).Martin Meredith, The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence, p. 246. They were assisted in this invasion by the armed Western Somali Liberation Front. Ethiopian forces were driven back far inside their own frontiers but, with the assistance of a massive Soviet airlift of arms and 17,000 Cuban combat forces, they stemmed the attack.Martin Meredith, The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence, p. 247. The last major Somali regular units left the Ogaden March 15, 1978. Twenty years later, the Somali region of Ethiopia remained under-developed and insecure. From 1977 through early 1978, thousands of suspected enemies of the Derg were tortured and/or killed in a purge called the Qey Shibir (\\"Red Terror\\"). Communism was officially adopted during the late 1970s and early 1980s; in 1984, the Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE) was established, and on February 1, 1987, a new Soviet-style civilian constitution was submitted to a popular referendum. It was officially endorsed by 81% of voters, and in accordance with this new constitution, the country was renamed the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia on September 10, 1987, and Mengistu became president. The regime's collapse was hastened by droughts and a famine, which affected around 8 million people and left 1 million dead, as well as by insurrections, particularly in the northern regions of Tigray and Eritrea. The regime also conducted a brutal campaign of resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia in the 1980s. In 1989, the Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). In May 1991, EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa. Mengistu fled the country to asylum in Zimbabwe, where he still resides. Hundreds of thousands were killed due to the Red Terror, forced deportations, or from using hunger as a weapon. In 2006, after a long trial, Mengistu was found guilty of genocide. = Modern period (1991‚Äìpresent) = In July 1991, the EPRDF, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), and others established the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE), which was composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution. In June 1992, the OLF withdrew from the government; in March 1993, members of the Southern Ethiopia Peoples' Democratic Coalition also left the government. Flag of Ethiopia Eritrea separated from Ethiopia following the fall of the Derg in 1991, after a long independentist war. In 1994, a new constitution was written that formed a bicameral legislature and a judicial system. A general election in 1995 to elect the Parliament also elected Meles Zenawi as prime minister and Negasso Gidada as president. Ethiopia's second multiparty election was held in 2000 and Meles was re- elected as prime minister. In October 2001, Lieutenant Girma Wolde-Giorgis was elected president. In the 2005 general election, allegations of irregularities that brought victory to the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front resulted in widespread protests in which the government is accused of massacring civilians (see Ethiopian police massacres). With the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with the rise of radical Islamism, Ethiopia again turned to the Western powers for alliance and assistance. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with US forces based out of the Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) established in Djibouti, in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Ethiopia allowed the US to station military advisors at Camp Hurso. In 2006, an Islamic organisation seen by many as having ties with al-Qaeda, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), spread rapidly in Somalia. Ethiopia sent logistical support to the Transitional Federal Government opposing the Islamists. Finally, on December 20, 2006, active fighting broke out between the ICU and Ethiopian Army. As the Islamist forces were of no match against the Ethiopian regular army, they decided to retreat and merge among the civilians, and most of the ICU-held Somalia was quickly taken. Human Rights Watch accused Ethiopia of various abuses including indiscriminate killing of civilians during the Battle of Mogadishu (March ‚Äì April 2007). Ethiopian forces pulled out of Somalia in January 2009, leaving a small African Union force and smaller Somali Transitional Government force to maintain the peace. Reports immediately emerged of religious fundamentalist forces occupying one of two former Ethiopian bases in Mogadishu shortly after withdrawal. Meles Zenawi died on 20 August 2012 and was succeeded as prime minister by Hailemariam Desalegn. On 7 October 2013, Mulatu Teshome was elected president of the country. On 2 April 2018, Abiy Ahmed was declared Prime Minister. Sahle-Work Zewde is the 4th and current President of Ethiopia, the first woman to hold the office. Ethnic violence rose with the political unrest. There were Oromo‚ÄìSomali clashes between the Oromo, who make up the largest ethnic group in the country, and the ethnic Somalis, leading to up to 400,000 to be displaced in 2017. Gedeo‚ÄìOromo clashes between the Oromo and the Gedeo people in the south of the country led to Ethiopia having the largest number of people to flee their homes in the world in 2018, with 1.4 million newly displaced people. In September 2018 in the minorities protest that took place in Oromo near the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, 23 people were killed. Some have blamed the rise in ethnic violence by the Oromo on the new Oromo Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for giving space to groups formerly banned by previous Tigrayan led governments, such as the Oromo Liberation Front.

He was born in Ju√°rez, Mexico, in 1969 and raised in South Central Los Angeles. Johnny \\"J\\" was co-owner and CEO of Klock Work Entertainment. Early life Johnny \\"J\\" was raised on 103rd and Budlong in South Central, Los Angeles, by his adoptive parents. His father, John Sr., was a mechanic by trade who worked for the naval shipyards and now works for the U.S. Defense Department. His mother, Lidia, was a bilingual school teacher. His parents bought him a drum set as a kid, and allowed him to create a makeshift studio in their garage. Johnny's interest in hip-hop escalated while he was at Washington Preparatory High School. He played on the drum line and hit it off with the aspiring rapper Candell \\"Candyman\\" Manson; future artists such as Yo-Yo, WC and Sir Jinx, of Da Lench Mob, and F. Gary Gray famed Director also attended Washington Prep around that time, where he played drums in the high school marching band and took music theory classes. Johnny was given a full scholarship to attend The Berklee College of Music (in Boston) wherein he received a full music scholarship, which he declined to accept, in the mid-1980s. After graduating high school in 1987, Johnny got his big break, producing \\"Knockin' Boots\\" for Candyman and his entire album \\"Ain't No Shame In My Game\\". The song went platinum and reached No. 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 in summer 1990, pushing Candyman's debut album, Ain't No Shame In My Game, into gold status. Johnny toured the world with Candyman until 1992. Early in 1992, Johnny \\"J\\" married Capucine Cantrell. They have two children together named Zhani and Niamyja and one from a previous relationship, Malaysia. The two had a loving and business relationship, and in 1995 they formed KLOCK WORK Entertainment together. They were married until his untimely death in 2008. Musical career =Early productions (1989‚Äì1992)= In late 1993, Big Syke, a member of 2Pac's group Thug Life introduced Johnny to 'Pac. They quickly gelled, recording \\"Pour Out a Little Liquor\\", for the Above the Rim soundtrack, and \\"Death Around the Corner,\\" which would appear on Me Against the World. The partnership was derailed, though, when Tupac was sent to prison in February 1995. After his release that October, the pair reunited at Can-Am Studios in L.A.. Tupac felt very secure with him in the studio. 2Pac and Johnny J recorded more than a hundred songs together‚Äî11 of them, including \\"How Do U Want It\\" and \\"All About U\\", ended up on All Eyez on Me; the rest composed the bulk of 2Pac's posthumous work. Throughout producer Johnny J's career, he had sold over 100 million albums. He produced his classmate Candyman's 1989 EP Hip Hop Addict and his 1990 single \\"Knockin' Boots\\" for his classmate Candyman's album Ain't No Shame in My Game, which went platinum thanks to the single. He also produced the early work of recording artist Shady Montage who eventually went on to become Shade Sheist. =Tupac Shakur, Death Row Records and solo album (1993‚Äì1996)= After the numerous nominations for Candyman, Johnny J met 2Pac and recorded nine tracks with him in three days . Following these recordings Johnny produced \\"Pour Out a Little Liquor\\" which appeared on the Above the Rim soundtrack and 2Pac's Thug Life album. The soundtrack eventually went Double Platinum and won the Soundtrack of The Year Award at the 1995 Source Awards. Johnny produced the track \\"Death Around The Corner\\" which ended up on 2Pac's third solo album entitled Me Against The World. That album eventually went to the top of the Billboard 200. Johnny J recorded and released his debut rap album I Gotta Be Me in 1994, which spawned two singles: \\"Get Away From Me\\" and \\"Dig Um' Out\\". A music video was shot for \\"Get Away From Me\\". Jackson produced the entire album, and even showcased his singing abilities on such tracks as \\"Love's the Way\\". The beat for \\"Better Off\\" would later be recycled for 2Pac's \\"Picture Me Rollin'\\" in his 1996 album All Eyez On Me. I Gotta Be Me is now out of print and hard to find. After 2Pac's release in late 1995, the two began collaborating for 2Pac's Death Row Records debut All Eyez On Me. The double album was released early next year, and Johnny J produced the chart topping hits \\"All Bout U\\", \\"How Do U Want It\\" and \\"Life Goes On\\". He also produced \\"Thug Passion\\", \\"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug\\", \\"Wonda Why They Call U Bitch\\", \\"Run tha Streetz\\", \\"All Eyez on Me\\", \\"What'z Ya Phone #\\" and \\"Picture Me Rollin'\\" The album is one of the most influential albums in hip hop history, and according to the RIAA, nine million copies of the album were sold in the United States alone by June 18, 1998. According to 2pacworld.com, Johnny J. \\"co-wrote and helped produce 11 songs on All Eyez on Me and was never paid the $100,000 advance or the per song royalties of 3% he was supposed to receive.\\" This financial dispute has led some to believe Death Row was somehow responsible for his death; preferring to have him killed than to pay royalties which would number in the millions because of the commercial success of 2pac albums he helped produce. =Miscellaneous ventures (1997‚Äì2005)= Prior to Tupac Shakur's death Johnny produced over 150 tracks for the rapper, a great deal of them unreleased. Many of Johnny's collaborations with Shakur ended up being remixed for his posthumous releases such as \\"Until the End of Time\\", \\"Better Dayz\\", and \\"R U Still Down? (Remember Me)\\", while only a select few remained in their original form. Johnny had composed a few music scores in such films as Gridlock'd. The first artist Johnny collaborated with after 2Pac's death was Bizzy Bone from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony. Johnny produced \\"Thugz Cry\\" and \\"Nobody Can Stop Me\\" off of the Heavenz Movie album, a release that went Platinum. In 2009 Klock Work Entertainment confirmed that Johnny produced a whole album for Bizzy, but was never released. Along with Napoleon from the Outlawz and Val Young, Johnny released \\"Never Forget\\" in 2004, a tribute song to 2Pac. A music video was shot for the song, and includes many guest appearances from many of Shakur's close friends. =Final years (2006‚Äì2008)= In mid-2006, Johnny J premiered a ten-year anniversary Tupac tribute track on a charitable compilation by Mutulu Shakur entitled A 2Pac Tribute: Dare 2 Struggle. The song was written by a new artist working with Klock Work at the time named T-Jay. In mid-2008, Iranian-Canadian rapper Imaan Faith collaborated with Deejay Ra to release Imaan's debut album Let The Truth Be Known on Universal Music Canada, featuring an opening track with Johnny J entitled \\"Goin 2 Da Top\\", which was recorded at Johnny's studio in California in mid-2006. Johnny J had been recording for most of 2008 with actress/singer Tatyana Ali on her sophomore music album The Light. DUI arrest and death On July 27, 2008, Johnny J was arrested in Los Angeles, California for DUI, and sentenced to three years in prison during a trial three weeks later. On October 3, 2008, while serving his sentence at the Twin Towers Correctional Facility located in Los Angeles, California, Johnny allegedly jumped off an upper tier of the prison in an apparent suicide at about 6:45PM. He was found dead 45 minutes later, at the age of 39.

Chap. 11, Inscription DAE 8 Ruled by the Aksumites, it existed from approximately 80 BC to AD 825. The polity was centered in the city of Axum and grew from the proto-Aksumite Iron Age period around the 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD. Aksum became a major player on the commercial route between the Roman Empire and Ancient India. The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own Aksumite currency, with the state establishing its hegemony over the declining Kingdom of Kush. It also regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and eventually extended its rule over the region with the conquest of the Himyarite Kingdom. The Manichaei prophet Mani (died 274 AD) regarded Axum as one of the four great powers of his time, the others being Persia, Rome and China.Daily Life in Aksum eduplace.com The Aksumites erected monumental stelae, which served a religious purpose in pre-Christian times. One of these granite columns is the largest such structure in the world, at 90 feet.

The Kingdom used the name \\"Ethiopia\\" as early as the 4th century.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia, 2005. Tradition claims Axum as the alleged resting place of the Ark of the Covenant and the purported home of the Queen of Sheba. Historical records Aksum is mentioned in the first-century AD Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as an important market place for the trade in ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world. It states that the ruler of Aksum in the first century was Zoskales, who, besides ruling the kingdom, likewise controlled land near the Red Sea: Adulis (near Massawa) and lands through the highlands of present-day Eritrea. He is also said to have been familiar with Greek literature. History =Origins= Largely on the basis of Carlo Conti Rossini's theories and prolific work on Ethiopian history, Aksum was previously thought to have been founded by the Sabaeans, who spoke a language from the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. Evidence suggests that Semitic-speaking Aksumites semiticized the Agaw people, who originally spoke other Afroasiatic languages from the family's Cushitic branch, and had already established an independent civilization in the territory before the arrival of the Sabaeans. The King Ezana's Stela, an Aksumite obelisk in Axum, Ethiopia Scholars like Stuart Munro-Hay thus point to the existence of an older kingdom known as D ømt, which flourished in the area between the tenth and fifth centuries BC, prior to the proposed Sabaean migration in the fourth or fifth century BC. They also cite evidence indicating that Sabaean settlers resided in the region for little more than a few decades. Sabaean influence is now thought to have been minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century, perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of or some proto-Aksumite state. As George Hatke put it: > The most significant and lasting impact of these colonists was the > establishment of a writing system and the introduction of Semitic > speech‚Äîboth of which the Ethiopians modified considerably. . . . South > Arabian culture [was] a foreign commodity from which the Ethiopians were > able to freely pick and chose when they saw fit, rather than an entire > civilization imposed by foreign rulers.George Hatke, ‚ÄúAfricans in Arabia > Felix: Aksumite Relations with Himyar in the Sixth Century‚Äù (PhD diss., > Princeton University, 2011). The Ge'ez language is no longer universally thought of, as previously assumed, to be an offshoot of Sabaean or Old South Arabian,Weninger, Stefan, \\"Ge'ez\\" in Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha, p. 732. and there is some linguistic (though not written) evidence of Semitic languages being spoken in Eritrea and Ethiopia since approximately 2000 BC. However, the Ge'ez script later replaced Epigraphic South Arabian in the Kingdom of Aksum.

Axumite Menhir in Balaw Kalaw (Metera) near Senafe The Kingdom of Aksum was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia. It existed approximately 100‚Äì940 AD, growing from the Iron Age proto-Aksumite period c. fourth century BC to achieve prominence by the first century AD. According to the Book of Aksum, Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush. The capital was later moved to Axum in northern Ethiopia. The Kingdom used the name \\"Ethiopia\\" as early as the fourth century.Henze, Paul B. (2005) Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia, . The Empire of Aksum at its height at times extended across most of present-day Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen and parts of Sudan. The capital city of the empire was Aksum, now in northern Ethiopia. Today a smaller community, the city of Aksum was once a bustling metropolis, cultural and economic center. Two hills and two streams lie on the east and west expanses of the city; perhaps providing the initial impetus for settling this area. Along the hills and plain outside the city, the Aksumites had cemeteries with elaborate grave stones called stelee or obelisks. Other important cities included Yeha, Hawulti-Melazo, Matara, Adulis, and Qohaito, the last three of which are now in Eritrea. By the reign of Endubis in the late third century, it had begun minting its own currency and was named by Mani as one of the four great powers of his time along with the Sasanian Empire, Roman Empire, and \\"Three Kingdoms\\" China. The Aksumites adopted Christianity as its state religion in 325 or 328 AD under King Ezana, and was the first state ever to use the image of the cross on its coins.http://users.clas.ufl.edu/sterk/junsem/haas.pdfhttp://whc.unesco.org/en/list/15 Around the 3rd century (possibly c. 240‚Äìc. 260), the Axumites led by Sembrouthes were victorious over the Sesea, with Sesea becoming a tributary of the Kingdom of Aksum. Around 330, Ezana of Axum led his army into the Kingdom of Mero√´, conquering and sacking the town itself. A large stone monument was left there, and the conquest is also related on Ezana Stone.Stanley M.

For nearly half a century south Arabia would become an Ethiopian protectorate under Abraha and his son Masruq. Dhu Nuwas was deposed and killed and Kaleb appointed a Christian Himyarite, Esimiphaios (\\"Sumuafa Ashawa\\"), as his viceroy. However, around 525 this viceroy was deposed by the Aksumite general Abraha with support of Ethiopians who had settled in Yemen, and withheld tribute to Kaleb. When Kaleb sent another expedition against Abraha this force defected, killing their commander, and joining Abraha. Another expedition sent against them was defeated, leaving Yemen under Abraha's rule, although payment of a tribute resumed, where he continued to promote the Christian faith until his death. After Abraha's death, his son Masruq Abraha continued the Axumite vice-royalty in Yemen, resuming payment of tribute to Axum. However, his half-brother Ma'd-Karib revolted. After being denied by Justinian, Ma'd-Karib sought help from Khosrow I, the Sassanid Persian Emperor, thus triggering the Aksumite‚ÄìPersian wars. Khosrow sent a small fleet and army under commander Vahrez to depose the current king of Yemen. The war culminated with the Siege of Sana'a, capital of Axumite Yemen. After its fall in 570, and Masruq death, Ma'd-Karib's son, Saif, was put on the throne. In 575, the war resumed again, after Saif was killed by Axumites. The Persian general Vahrez led another army of 8000, ending Axum rule in Yemen and becoming hereditary governor of Yemen. According to Munro-Hay, these wars may have been Aksum's swan-song as a great power, with an overall weakening of Aksumite authority and over-expenditure in money and manpower. of king Khosrau I war against Masruq Abraha in Yemen According to Ethiopian traditions, Kaleb eventually abdicated and retired to a monastery. It is also possible that Ethiopia was affected by the Plague of Justinian around this time.First Hegira Aksum, though weakened, remained a strong empire and trading power until the rise of Islam in the 7th century. However, unlike the relations between the Islamic powers and Christian Europe, Aksum (see Sahama), was on good terms with its Islamic neighbors and provided shelter to Muhammad's early followers around 615. Nevertheless, as early as 640, Umar sent a naval expedition against Adulis, the Expedition of Alqammah bin Mujazziz, but it was eventually defeated.E. Cerulli, \\"Ethiopia's Relations with the Muslim World\\" in Cambridge History of Africa: Africa from the Seventh to the Eleventh century, p. 575; Trimingham, Spencer, Islam in Ethiopia, p. 46. In the 7th century, early Muslims from Mecca sought refuge from Quraysh persecution by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in Islamic history as the First Hijra. However the religion did not established until the arrival of the Ottomans in the 15th century. http://goblues.org/faculty/weekse/files/2012/08/axum-and-the-solomonic- dynasty.pdf Aksumite naval power also declined throughout the period, though in 702 Aksumite pirates were able to invade the Hejaz and occupy Jeddah. In retaliation, however, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik was able to take the Dahlak Archipelago from Aksum, which became Muslim from that point on, though it later recovered in the ninth century and became a vassal to the Emperor of Ethiopia.Daniel Kendie, The Five Dimensions of the Eritrean Conflict 1941‚Äì2004: Deciphering the Geo-Political Puzzle. United States of America: Signature Book Printing, Inc., 2005, pp. 228. =Decline= After a second golden age in the early 6th century the empire began to decline in the mid 6th century,David W. Phillipson (2012): Foundations of an African Civilisation: Aksum and the Northern Horn, 1000 BC ‚Äì AD 1300. James Currey. p. 209 eventually ceasing its production of coins in the early 7th century. Around this same time, the Aksumite population was forced to go farther inland to the highlands for protection, abandoning Aksum as the capital. Arab writers of the time continued to describe Ethiopia (no longer referred to as Aksum) as an extensive and powerful state, though they had lost control of most of the coast and their tributaries. While land was lost in the north, it was gained in the south; and, though Ethiopia was no longer an economic power, it still attracted Arab merchants. The capital was moved to a new location, currently unknown, though it may have been called Ku'bar or Jarmi. Eventually, the Rashidun Caliphate took control of the Red Sea and Egypt by 646, pushing Aksum into economic isolation. Northwest of Aksum, in modern-day Sudan, the Christian states of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia lasted till the 13th century before becoming Islamic. Aksum, isolated, nonetheless still remained Christian. Under the reign of Degna Djan, during the 10th century, the empire kept expanding south, and sent troops into the modern-day region of Kaffa,Werner J. Lange, ‚ÄùHistory of the Southern Gonga (southwestern Ethiopia)‚Äú, Steiner, 1982, p. 18 while at the same time undertaking missionary activity into Angot and Amhara. Local history holds that, around 960, a Jewish Queen named Yodit (Judith) or \\"Gudit\\" defeated the empire and burned its churches and literature. While there is evidence of churches being burned and an invasion around this time, her existence has been questioned by some western authors. Another possibility is that the Aksumite power was ended by a southern pagan queen named Bani al-Hamwiyah, possibly of the tribe al-Damutah or Damoti (Sidama). It is clear from contemporary sources that a female usurper did indeed rule the country at this time, and that her reign ended some time before 1003. After a short Dark Age, the Aksumite Empire was succeeded by the Agaw Zagwe dynasty in the 11th or 12th century (most likely around 1137), although limited in size and scope. However, Yekuno Amlak, who killed the last Zagwe king and founded the modern Solomonic dynasty around 1270 traced his ancestry and his right to rule from the last emperor of Aksum, Dil Na'od. It should be mentioned that the end of the Aksumite Empire didn't mean the end of Aksumite culture and traditions; for example, the architecture of the Zagwe dynasty at Lalibela and Yemrehana Krestos Church shows heavy Aksumite influence.  Climate change hypothesis  Climatic change and trade isolation have also been claimed as large reasons for the decline of the culture. The local subsistence base was substantially augmented by a climatic shift during the 1st century AD that reinforced the spring rains, extended the rainy season from 3 1/2 to six or seven months, vastly improved the surface and subsurface water supply, doubled the length of the growing season, and created an environment comparable to that of modern central Ethiopia (where two crops can be grown per annum without the aid of irrigation). This appears to explain how one of the marginal agricultural environments of Ethiopia was able to support the demographic base that made this far flung commercial empire possible. It may also explain why no Aksumite rural settlement expansion into the moister, more fertile, and naturally productive lands of Begemder or Lasta can be verified during the heyday of Aksumite power. As international profits from the exchange network declined, Aksum lost its ability to control its own raw material sources and that network collapsed. The already persistent environmental pressure of a large population to maintain a high level of regional food production had to be intensified. The result was a wave of soil erosion that began on a local scale c. 650 and attained catastrophic proportions after 700. Presumably complex socio-economic inputs compounded the problem. These are traditionally reflected in declining maintenance, deterioration and partial abandonment of marginal crop land, shifts to destructive pastoral exploitation, and eventual, wholesale and irreversible land degradation. This syndrome was possibly accelerated by an apparent decline in rainfall reliability beginning 730‚Äì760, with the presumed result that an abbreviated modern growing season was reestablished during the 9th century.Karl W. Butzer, ‚ÄùRise and Fall of Axum, Ethiopia: A Geo- Archaeological Interpretation‚Äú, American Antiquity 46, (July 1981), p. 495 Foreign relations, trade, and economy Aksum was an important participant in international trade from the 1st century AD (Periplus of the Erythraean Sea) until circa the later part of the 1st millennium when it succumbed to a long decline against pressures from the various Islamic powers leagued against it. The economically important northern Silk Road and southern Spice (Eastern) trade routes. The sea routes around the horn of Africa and the Indian sub- continent made Aksum an important trading port for nearly a millennium. Covering parts of what is now northern Ethiopia and southern and eastern Eritrea, Aksum was deeply involved in the trade network between India and the Mediterranean (Rome, later Byzantium), exporting ivory, tortoise shell, gold and emeralds, and importing silk and spices. Aksum's access to both the Red Sea and the Upper Nile enabled its strong navy to profit in trade between various African (Nubia), Arabian (Yemen), and Indian states. The main exports of Aksum were, as would be expected of a state during this time, agricultural products. The land was much more fertile during the time of the Aksumites than now, and their principal crops were grains such as wheat and barley. The people of Aksum also raised cattle, sheep, and camels. Wild animals were also hunted for things such as ivory and rhinoceros horns. They traded with Roman traders as well as with Egyptian and Persian merchants. The empire was also rich with gold and iron deposits. These metals were valuable to trade, but another mineral was also widely traded: salt. Salt was abundant in Aksum and was traded quite frequently. It benefited from a major transformation of the maritime trading system that linked the Roman Empire and India. This change took place around the start of the 1st century. The older trading system involved coastal sailing and many intermediary ports. The Red Sea was of secondary importance to the Persian Gulf and overland connections to the Levant. Starting around 100 BC a route from Egypt to India was established, making use of the Red Sea and using monsoon winds to cross the Arabian Sea directly to southern India. By about 100 AD, the volume of traffic being shipped on this route had eclipsed older routes. Roman demand for goods from southern India increased dramatically, resulting in greater number of large ships sailing down the Red Sea from Roman Egypt to the Arabian Sea and India.http://www.ruperthopkins.com/pdf/Kingdom_of_Axum.pdf An Ethiopian illuminated Evangelist portrait of Mark the Evangelist, from the Ethiopian Garima Gospels, 6th century, Kingdom of Aksum, influenced by Eastern Roman artDe Lorenzi, James (2015), Guardians of the Tradition: Historians and Historical Writing in Ethiopia and Eritrea, Rochester: University of Rochester Press, pp. 15‚Äì16, . The Kingdom of Aksum was ideally located to take advantage of the new trading situation. Adulis soon became the main port for the export of African goods, such as ivory, incense, gold, slaves, and exotic animals. In order to supply such goods the kings of Aksum worked to develop and expand an inland trading network. A rival, and much older trading network that tapped the same interior region of Africa was that of the Kingdom of Kush, which had long supplied Egypt with African goods via the Nile corridor. By the 1st century AD, however, Aksum had gained control over territory previously Kushite. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea explicitly describes how ivory collected in Kushite territory was being exported through the port of Adulis instead of being taken to Mero√´, the capital of Kush. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD the Kingdom of Aksum continued to expand their control of the southern Red Sea basin. A caravan route to Egypt was established which bypassed the Nile corridor entirely. Aksum succeeded in becoming the principal supplier of African goods to the Roman Empire, not least as a result of the transformed Indian Ocean trading system.The effect of the Indian Ocean trading system on the rise of Aksum is described in State Formation in Ancient Northeast Africa and the Indian Ocean Trade , by Stanley M. Burstein. Society The Aksumite population consisted of Semitic-speaking people (collectively known as Habeshas),Crawford Young, The Rising Tide of Cultural Pluralism: The Nation-state at Bay?, (University of Wisconsin Press: 1993), p. 160Rainer Baudendistel, Between Bombs and Good Intentions: The Red Cross and the Italo-Ethiopian War, (Berghahn Books: 2006), p. 320George Kurian, Dictionary of world politics, (CQ Press: 2002), p. 150 Cushitic-speaking people, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking people (the Kunama and Nara). Aksumites had a modified feudal system to farm the land. =Kings= The Aksumite kings had the official title ·äê·åà·à† ·ç° ·äê·åà·à†·â∞ ng≈õ ng≈õt - King of Kings (later vocalization Ge'ez ·äï·åâ·à† ·ç° ·äê·åà·à•·âµ nig≈´≈õa naga≈õt, Modern Ethiosemitic nig≈´se negest). Culture Al‚ÄìQalis Church cathedral built by Abraha in Sana'a between 527 and 560 The Empire of Aksum is notable for a number of achievements, such as its own alphabet, the Ge'ez script, which was eventually modified to include vowels, becoming an abugida. Furthermore, in the early times of the empire, around 1700 years ago, giant obelisks to mark emperors' (and nobles') tombs (underground grave chambers) were constructed, the most famous of which is the Obelisk of Aksum. Under Emperor Ezana, Aksum adopted Christianity in place of its former polytheistic and Judaic religions around 325. This gave rise to the present day Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (only granted autonomy from the Coptic Church in 1959), and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church (granted autonomy from the Ethiopian Orthodox church in 1993). Since the schism with Orthodoxy following the Council of Chalcedon (451), it has been an important Miaphysite church, and its scriptures and liturgy continue to be in Ge'ez. =Religion= Typical Aksumite architecture ‚Äì the monastery of Debre Damo. Before its conversion to Christianity, the Aksumites practiced a polytheistic religion related to the religion practiced in southern Arabia. This included the use of the crescent-and-disc symbol used in southern Arabia and the northern horn. In the UNESCO sponsored General History of Africa French archaeologist Francis Anfray, suggests that the pagan Aksumites worshipped Astar, his son, Mahrem, and Beher.

The right one reads in Greek ŒïŒùŒîŒ•ŒíŒôC ŒíŒëCŒôŒõŒïŒ•C, \\"King Endybis\\". Steve Kaplan argues that with Aksumite culture came a major change in religion, with only Astar remaining of the old gods, the others being replaced by what he calls a \\"triad of indigenous divinities, Mahrem, Beher and Medr.\\" He also suggests that Aksum culture was significantly influenced by Judaism, saying that \\"The first carriers of Judaism reached Ethiopia between the reign of Queen of Sheba BC and conversion to Christianity of King Ezana in the fourth century AC.\\" He believes that although Ethiopian tradition suggests that these were present in large numbers, that \\"A relatively small number of texts and individuals dwelling in the cultural, economic, and political center could have had a considerable impact.\\" and that \\"their influence was diffused throughout Ethiopian culture in its formative period. By the time Christianity took hold in the fourth century, many of the originally Hebraic-Jewish elements had been adopted by much of the indigenous population and were no longer viewed as foreign characteristics. Nor were they perceived as in conflict with the acceptance of Christianity.\\" Before converting to Christianity King Ezana II's coins and inscriptions show that he might have worshiped the gods Astar, Beher, Meder/Medr, and Mahrem. Another of Ezana's inscriptions is clearly Christian and refers to \\"the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\\". Around 324 AD the King Ezana II was converted to Christianity by his teacher Frumentius, the founder of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Frumentius taught the emperor while he was young, and it is believed that at some point staged the conversion of the empire. We know that the Aksumites converted to Christianity because in their coins they replaced the disc and crescent with the cross, the Axumite Jews, however, rejected the new religion and rebelled by creating the Kingdom of Semien. Frumentius was in contact with the Church of Alexandria, and was appointed Bishop of Ethiopia around the year 330. The Church of Alexandria never closely managed the affairs of the churches in Aksum, allowing them to develop their own unique form of Christianity. However, the Church of Alexandria probably did retain some influence considering that the churches of Aksum followed the Church of Alexandria into Oriental Orthodoxy by rejecting the Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. Aksum is also the alleged home of the holy relic the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark is said to have been placed in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion by Menelik I for safekeeping. Islam came in the 7th century at the reign of Ashama ibn-Abjar when the followers of the Prophet Muhammed were persecuted by the ruling tribe and begun migrating after the first followers got asylum from the King many begun to migrate. All of them returned to Medina in 622. =Ethiopian sources= Ethiopian sources such as the Kebra Nagast and the Fetha Nagast describe Aksum as a Jewish Kingdom. The Kebra Nagast contains a narrative of how the Queen of Sheba/Queen Makeda of Ethiopia met King Solomon and traces Ethiopia's to Menelik I, her son by King Solomon of Israel. In its existing form, the Kebra Nagast is at least 700 years old and is considered by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church to be a reliable and historic work. =Coinage= Silver coin of Ezana. The Empire of Aksum was one of the first African polities to issue its own coins, which bore legends in Ge'ez and Greek. From the reign of Endubis up to Armah (approximately 270 to 610), gold, silver and bronze coins were minted. Issuing coinage in ancient times was an act of great importance in itself, for it proclaimed that the Aksumite Empire considered itself equal to its neighbours. Many of the coins are used as signposts about what was happening when they were minted. An example being the addition of the cross to the coin after the conversion of the empire to Christianity. The presence of coins also simplified trade, and was at once a useful instrument of propaganda and a source of profit to the empire. =Architecture= Homely architecture Ruins of the Dungur palace in Axum. In general, elite Aksumite buildings such as palaces were constructed atop podia built of loose stones held together with mud-mortar, with carefully cut granite corner blocks which rebated back a few centimeters at regular intervals as the wall got higher, so the walls narrowed as they rose higher. These podia are often all that survive of Aksumite ruins. Above the podia, walls were generally built with alternating layers of loose stone (often whitewashed, like at Yemrehana Krestos Church) and horizontal wooden beams, with smaller round wooden beams set in the stonework often projecting out of the walls (these are called 'monkey heads') on the exterior and sometimes the interior. Both the podia and the walls above exhibited no long straight stretches but were indented at regular intervals so that any long walls consisted of a series of recesses and salients. This helped to strengthen the walls. Worked granite was used for architectural features including columns, bases, capitals, doors, windows, paving, water spouts (often shaped like lion heads) and so on, as well as enormous flights of stairs that often flanked the walls of palace pavilions on several sides. Doors and windows were usually framed by stone or wooden cross-members, linked at the corners by square 'monkey heads', though simple lintels were also used. Many of these Aksumite features are seen carved into the famous stelae as well as in the later rock hewn churches of Tigray and Lalibela. Palaces usually consisted of a central pavilion surrounded by subsidiary structures pierced by doors and gates that provided some privacy (see Dungur for an example). The largest of these structures now known is the Ta'akha Maryam, which measured 120 √ó 80m, though as its pavilion was smaller than others discovered it is likely that others were even larger. Some clay models of houses survive to give us an idea of what smaller dwellings were like. One depicts a round hut with a conical roof thatched in layers, while another depicts a rectangular house with rectangular doors and windows, a roof supported by beams that end in 'monkey heads', and a parapet and water spout on the roof. Both were found in Hawelti. Another depicts a square house with what appear to be layers of pitched thatch forming the roof. Stelae The stelae (hawilt/hawilti in local languages) are perhaps the most identifiable part of the Aksumite architectural legacy. These stone towers served to mark graves and represent a magnificent multi-storied palace. They are decorated with false doors and windows in typical Aksumite design. The largest of these towering obelisks would measure 33 meters high had it not fractured. The stelae have most of their mass out of the ground, but are stabilized by massive underground counter-weights. The stone was often engraved with a pattern or emblem denoting the king's or the noble's rank. In literature The Aksumite Empire is portrayed as the main ally of Byzantium in the Belisarius series by David Drake and Eric Flint published by Baen Books. The series takes place during the reign of Kaleb, who in the series was assassinated by the Malwa in 532 at the Ta'akha Maryam and succeeded by his youngest son Eon bisi Dakuen. In the Elizabeth Wein series The Lion Hunters, Mordred and his family take refuge in Aksum after the fall of Camelot. Kaleb is the ruler in the first book; he passes his sovereignty onto his son Gebre Meskal, who rules during the Plague of Justinian.

BackupHDDVD can be used to decrypt AACS protected content once one knows the encryption key. muslix64 claimed to have found title and volume keys in main memory while playing HD DVDs using a software player, and that finding them is not difficult. = 2007 = On January 1, 2007, muslix64 published a new version of the program, with volume key support. On January 12, 2007, other forum members detailed how to find other title and volume keys, stating they had also found the keys of several movies in RAM while running WinDVD. On or about January 13, a title key was posted on pastebin.com in the form of a riddle, which was solved by entering terms into the Google search engine. By converting these results to hexadecimal, a correct key could be formed. Later that day, the first cracked HD DVD, Serenity, was uploaded on a private torrent tracker. The AACS LA confirmed on January 26 that the title keys on certain HD DVDs had been published without authorization. Doom9.org forum user arnezami found and published the \\"09 F9\\" AACS processing key on February 11: This key is not specific to any playback device or DVD title. Doom9.org forum user jx6bpm claimed on March 4 to have revealed CyberLink's PowerDVD's key, and that it was the key in use by AnyDVD. The AACS LA announced on April 16 that it had revoked the decryption keys associated with certain software high-definition DVD players, which will not be able to decrypt AACS encrypted disks mastered after April 23, without an update of the software. On May 17, one week before any discs with the updated processing key had reached retail, claims were reported of the new keys having been retrieved from a preview disc of The Matrix Trilogy. On May 23, the key was posted on Edward Felten's Freedom to Tinker Blog and confirmed a week later by arnezami on Doom9 as the new processing key (MKB v3). = 2008 = In August, two new processing keys were posted: * , for MKB v4, and * , which appeared to work with MKB v6, MKB v7 and MKB v8 discs. = 2009 = In March, two additional processing keys were posted: * , for MKB v9 * , for MKB v10 = 2011 = In April, MKBv12 and MKBv13 was found. * , for MKB v12 and MKB v13 = 2012 = In September, more processing keys were posted. * , for MKBv14-MKBv16 * , for MKBv17 * , for MKBv18-MKBv19 * , for MKBv20-MKBv21 * , for MKBv22-MKBv30 = 2018 = In April, more processing keys were posted. * ; MKBv24-MKBv48 * ; MKBv24-MKBv25 * ; MKBv26-MKBv28 * ; MKBv30-MKBv35 * ; MKBv31-MKBv36 * ; MKBv36-MKBv38 * ; MKBv39-MKBv43 * ; MKBv44-MKBv51 * ; MKBv49-MKBv52 * ; MKBv53-MKBv54 * ; MKBv53-MKBv54 * ; MKBv55-MKBv57 * ; MKBv55-MKBv62  DMCA notices and Digg  Screenshot of the Digg front page during the user revolt; almost all the stories are related to the HD DVD key (except few at the last). As early as April 17, 2007, AACS LA had issued DMCA violation notices, sent by Charles S. Sims of Proskauer Rose. Following this, dozens of notices were sent to various websites hosted in the United States. On May 1, 2007, in response to a DMCA demand letter, technology news site Digg began closing accounts and removing posts containing or alluding to the key. The Digg community reacted by creating a flood of posts containing the key, many using creative ways of disguising the key, by semi-directly or indirectly inserting the number, such as in song or images (either representing the digits pictorially or directly representing bytes from the key as colors) or on merchandise. At one point, Digg's \\"entire homepage was covered with links to the HD-DVD code or anti-Digg references.\\" Eventually the Digg administrators reversed their position, with founder Kevin Rose stating: = Legal opinions = Lawyers and other representatives of the entertainment industry, including Michael Ayers, an attorney for Toshiba Corporation, expressed surprise at Digg's decision, but suggested that a suit aimed at Digg might merely spread the information more widely. The American Bar Association's eReport published a discussion of the controversy, in which Eric Goldman at Santa Clara University's High Tech Law Institute noted that the illegality of putting the code up is questionable (that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act may protect the provider when the material itself is not copyrighted), although continuing to allow posting of the key may be \\"risky\\", and entertainment lawyer Carole Handler noted that even if the material is illegal, laws such as the DMCA may prove ineffective in a practical sense.  Impact  In a response to the events occurring on Digg and the call to \\"Spread this number\\", the key was rapidly posted to thousands of pages, blogs and wikis across the Internet. The reaction was an example of the Streisand effect. Intellectual property lawyer Douglas J. Sorocco noted, \\"People are getting creative. It shows the futility of trying to stop this. Once the information is out there, cease-and-desist letters are going to infuriate this community more.\\" Outside the Internet and the mass media, the key has appeared in or on T-shirts, poetry, songs and music videos, illustrations and other graphic artworks, tattoos and body art, and comic strips. On Tuesday afternoon, May 1, 2007, a Google search for the key returned 9,410 results, while the same search the next morning returned nearly 300,000 results. On Friday, the BBC reported that a search on Google shows almost 700,000 pages have published the key, despite the fact that on April 17, the AACS LA sent a DMCA notice to Google, demanding that Google stop returning any results for searches for the key. Widespread news coverage, CNet, BBC, Financial Times, Associated Press included speculation on the development of user-driven websites, the legal liability of running a user- driven website, the perception of acceptance of DRM, the failure as a business model of \\"secrecy based businesses ... in every aspect\\" in the Internet era,It‚Äôs No Secret: Code Stirs Up a Web Storm and the harm an industry can cause itself with harshly-perceived legal action. In an opposing move, Carter Wood of the National Association of Manufacturers said they had removed the \\"Digg It\\"-link from their weblog. Media coverage initially avoided quoting the key itself. However, several US-based news sources have run stories containing the key, quoting its use on Digg, though none are known to have received DMCA notices as a result. Later reports have discussed this, quoting the key. Current TV broadcast the key during a Google Current story on the Digg incident on May 3, 2007, displaying it in full on screen for several seconds and placing the story on the station website. Wikipedia, on May 1, 2007, locked out the page named for the number \\"to prevent the former secret from being posted again. The page on HD DVD was locked, too, to keep out The Number.\\" This action was later reversed.All Public Logs Talk:HD DVD WikipediaAll Public Logs 09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0 Wikipedia No one has been arrested or charged for finding or publishing the original key. = AACS LA reaction = On May 7, 2007, the AACS LA announced on its website that it had \\"requested the removal solely of illegal circumvention tools, including encryption keys, from a number of web sites\\", and that it had \\"not requested the removal or deletion of any ... discussion or commentary\\". The statement continued, \\"AACS LA is encouraged by the cooperation it has received thus far from the numerous web sites that have chosen to address their legal obligations in a responsible manner.\\" BBC News had earlier quoted an AACS executive saying that bloggers \\"crossed the line\\", that AACS was looking at \\"legal and technical tools\\" to confront those who published the key, and that the events involving Digg were an \\"interesting new twist\\".

Arthur Newell Strahler (1960). Physical Geography. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Second Edition, p. 185F. J. Monkhouse (1978). A Dictionary of Geography. London: Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd. Climatology studies climatic change, and is an atmospheric science. Climate is an important physical element because it indicates the atmospheric condition of heat, moisture and circulation; it plays a dominant role in shaping vegetation and soil; and it ultimately affects all forms of life, as a result of the very definition of the word, which is a scientific prediction, based on evidentiary statistics, sustained over a long period. There are many elements that make up both the weather and the climate of a geographical location. The most significant of these elements are temperature, atmospheric pressure, wind, solar irradiance, humidity, precipitation, and topography. The greatest influence of climatic change is associated with not only natural, but also artificial factors, which can be measured in terms of both short-term and long-term climate change.In simple language it is the long time condition of any large area.  Modifying factors  The most important factors affecting climate are latitude, altitude, distance from the ocean and sea, orientation of mountain ranges toward prevailing winds, and the ocean current.

Founded in 1200, it is the only Premonstratensian house still active in Normandy, with two dependent priories at Conques and Tarbes.  History  =Medieval= In the mid-12th century, a priest named Turstin withdrew to a wooded Norman hill to live as a hermit, where he was quickly joined by a circle of followers. When Turstin died in 1200, the bishop of Bayeux established the community under the Rule of St. Augustine. Turstin's brother-in-law Raoul de Percy donated land for the abbey. In 1210, under the protection of La Lucerne Abbey, the order was incorporated into the order of Saint Norbert. Over the following years, the abbey continued to receive donation from the de Percy and de Vassy families, as well as from lesser nobility and well-to-do farmers. At the end of the 13th century, a church and monastic buildings were built to replace the hermitage. In 1343 the abbey's gifts were interrupted by the Hundred Years' War and rivalries between pro-French and pro-English lords in the area. In 1347 the Black Death killed a third of the population, the abbey's lands were uncultivated and the Bessin was ravaged by armed bands. The abbey itself was ravaged by Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, in 1389. =1500-1700= Mondaye flourished again under the abbacy of Jean Feray (1512-1557). Its monks attended the university of Caen and included many doctors of theology among them. However, this high period was interrupted by the French Wars of Religion, with the abbey burned, its treasures dispersed and its abbot Julien Guichard killed by Huguenots on 5 September 1564. After the Council of Trent, calm returned and the monastery church was restored thanks to support from Anne de M√©davy. In 1631, Claude Leclerc du Tremblay was appointed commendentory abbot by the king and headed the abbey for the next 75 years. The Lorraine reform revising the Saint Norbert rule and making it stricter and closer to its origins was adopted by Mondaye abbey in 1655. Choosing a prior by the chapter of the congregation partly avoided the disadvantages of a commendatory abbot. =1700-1815= Three regular abbots were appointed by Louis XIV and Louis XV, and ruled the abbey from 1704 to 1763. Under these three figures' aegis a total reconstruction was begun as part of the momentum of the new classicist style, to meet the then-prevailing need for grandeur in France. The church, monastic buildings, entrance pavilion and farm (where 30 people worked) were all rebuilt, though with the order's austerity maintained by small cells and by only having chimneys in the prior's lodging, the warming house and the infirmary. It was supervised by the architect Eustache Restout (himself prior and sub-prior of Mondaye) from 1706 to 1743, with his last years devoted to decorating the church (including paintings by his nephew Jean II Restout). In 1763 the abbey again fell under a commendatory abbot and building work stopped. On the French Revolution the Premonstratensian order was despoiled of its goods and the 17 monks at Mondaye were dispersed or imprisoned. One of them was father Paynel, cur√© de Juaye, who took the oath of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy before abandoning the priesthood to become mayor. Paynel did, however, reconcile with the church, saving the abbey church from destruction and taking nine priests opposed to the civil constitution into his house.Abbaye de Mondaye, Fran√ßois Petit, CRDP Rouen, 1979 Once the revolutionary turmoil was over, Father Goujon ceased to be clandestine prior and gathered together the parishes of Juaye, Couvert and Berni√®res-le-bocage - the commune of Juaye-Mondaye originated in this era. From 1806 to 1812 the monastic buildings housed a coll√®ge. =1815-1940= In 1815 the Trappists of Valenton took over the buildings at Mondaye but left them in 1854 when their maintenance became too expensive for them to bear. The Premonstratensian order moved back into the buildings on 13 June 1859, when the bishop of Bayeux solemnly handed back the keys to it to canons coming from the Belgian abbey at Grimbergen. The community underwent a major phase of expansion and increased their number of parochial missions, preaching tours and retreats. It also restarted work on building north and south wings in the classical style. A new crisis arose when the authorities of the French Third Republic wished to reduce monks' influence in society. In 1880 abbot Joseph Willekens was expelled as a foreigner and the canons were dispersed. The canons then regrouped in the ch√¢teau de Cottun, not far from the abbey, returned to the abbey in 1894, only to be re-expelled in 1902. On the second expulsion they headed into exile at the Bois-Seigneur-Isaac in Walloon Brabant in Belgium. In 1921 the monks were authorised to return to their abbey and new novices presented themselves. =1940 to present= In June 1944 the Allied landings subjected the abbey to many days of bombing and, despite being completely restored, the abbey walls are still marked by the fighting in its surroundings. Rebuilding works on the most badly damaged part of the church began in 2007. The church, monastic building, pressoir, pavilion, enclosure, grange, grange aux d√Æmes, cloister and interior decor are now listed together as a monument historique. The general chapter of Wilten, in 1968-1970, enforced obedience to the order's constitutions and the Vatican II directives. From this era onwards exchanges of information and participation with the lay world expanded, as did the workshop and farm. The canons of Mondaye, like all canon regulars, live communally but still deliver an external ministry, providing cur√©s and vicars for many parishes as well as prison and hospital chaplains, many of whom pursue a profession in civil society. It also welcomes retreats and visitors - parts of the abbey can be viewed by the public for an entrance fee, with visitors guided by a canon. Its shop sells various items made at the abbey, including CDs of its music. Architecture Nave of the church The nave =Church= The church is wholly as conceived by Eustache Restout, who also painted the paintings and designed the woodwork for the choir. 60m long, the building presents a blind portal, leaving space for the organ. The nave has 5 spans, with wide pillars supporting arches and with the south side illuminated by two openings on the north side. The altar is in the centre and the arms of the transept are large, as is Premonstratensian tradition. The dome above the altar is a copy of that of the now-vanished chapel of the ch√¢teau de Sceaux, painted by Charles Le Brun. =Organ= A fine example of Louis XV-era art, the organ was made by Claude Parisot from Lorraine. Its case was carved by the Flemish artist Melchior Verly. Completed in 1741, the instrument was restored in 1965 and in 2004 by the organmakers Jean-Baptiste Boisseau and Jean-Marie Gaborit. With 27 pipes, it is regularly used for concerts. File:Abb-mondaye-orgue.jpgThe organ in 1989 File:Entr√©e et orgue de l'abbaye de Mondaye.jpgThe organ =Monastic buildings= The cloister was begun in the 18th century with the east wing and part of the south wing, then continued, glazed but unfinished in the 19th century. It thus does not form the closed garden usual for cloisters. The staircase leading to the library and to the cells has wrought iron railings. The salle des pas- perdus has a self-portrait of Eustache Restout. =Library= It contains 40,000 volumes, of which some are 16th century.

Inscriptions dating back to the Lichchavi era were found there. An inscription was found in Toukhel, former Ward 6 of Chitlang VDC, established by king Amshubarma (in sambat 37) (now ward no 10 of Thaha Municipality). According to the inscription, Amshubarma had given the land to shepherds and established a settlement for shepherds in Toukhel, Nhulgaun and Kunchhal of Chitlang. Some historians believe that these people, called Gopalis are the descendants of rulers of the Gopal era. Chitlang hosts multiple cultures: the Tamang culture is in former ward no. 1. In ward no. 2 Khas (Newar, Tamang and Brahmin) mix culture. In former wards 3, 4, 5, and 6 the Newari culture is found; wards 8, 7 and 9 have a mixed culture.

Attraction of Chitlang Demographics According to the 2013 census of Nepal, Chitland has an approximate population of 7,680 people. The main ethnic populations are Newar, Tamang, Khas and Brahmins.  Culture  Chitlang has a rich Newar culture. The Chitlang dialect of Nepal Bhasa is spoken almost exclusively in this region.Ethnologue The Balami language is one such language.  Getting there  There are several means to reach Chitlang from the capital city and with the introduction of a cable car to the top of the ridge, one can reduce the hike to just going downhill from the top after a short ride. Buses and smaller vehicles leave from Kathmandu and reach Taukhel near Chitlang via Kulekhani. Chitlang is an easy one hour walk from Taukhel. Buses from Hetauda go all the way to Chitlang also via Kulekhani and leave for Hetauda in the morning. Above Thankot is a settlement known as Godam from where some pickup vehicles leave for Chitlang in the morning and go via the Chandragiri pass; it's the shortest route taking about an hour. One set of buses travel via Pharping near Dakshinkali and takes about three hours but don't reach Chitlang, with Taukhel being the closest point. The other vehicles take the old Tribhuvan Highway to reach Kulekhani. The pick-up vehicles to Kathmandu from Chitlang leave in the morning while the bus leaves from Taukhel in the afternoon.Getting to Chitlang, Accommodation Accommodation There are several homestays that are controlled by the Home Stay Association (the office is beside the main road) which decides the rates and where the guests should stay.

Biography Huiguo was one of two Buddhist masters at Xi Ming Temple, the other being the Indian monk Praj√±ƒÅ.

Succession In time, Huiguo's prominence attracted students from Korea, Central Asia and even Java, aside from his Chinese students. By 805, Huiguo was introduced to the Japanese monk K≈´kai, who writes of the encounter (emphasis added): Huiguo began an intensive training of K≈´kai that ended when he died in 805 CE.

In , Sakamoto became the first player in Giants franchise history to start a season opener while under the age of 20 since Hideki Matsui. Early life and high school career Sakamoto was born in Itami, Hy≈çgo, and began playing baseball while in the first grade at Koyanosato Elementary School for the Koyanosato Tigers (a Little League team) alongside current New York Yankees pitcher Masahiro Tanaka. Ironically, Sakamoto was the team's ace pitcher, and Tanaka his batterymate on the team. Both Sakamoto and Tanaka went on to attend Itami Municipal Matsuzaki Junior High School, but Sakamoto opted to join Itami Senior, while Tanaka chose to play for the Takarazuka Boys. Upon graduating from junior high, Sakamoto attended Kosei Gakuin High School in northern Aomori Prefecture, a baseball powerhouse in the T≈çhoku region. He became the team's starting shortstop by the fall of his first year (the equivalent of tenth grade in the United States) at Kosei Gakuin High. Sakamoto was hitting cleanup by the summer of his second year (eleventh grade), and led his team to runners-up in the Tohoku Regional Tournament that fall, earning a berth in the 78th National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament that would be held at Koshien Stadium the following spring. He attracted the attention of scouts when he hit .813 (13-for-16) with four home runs in the Tohoku Regional Tournament later that spring, and hit a total of 39 home runs during his high school career. The Yomiuri Giants picked Sakamoto in the compensatory first round of the NPB high school player draft after losing to the Chunichi Dragons in the lottery that was held for fellow shortstop Naomichi Donoue, the most coveted high school position player, and presented Sakamoto the uniform number 61. Professional career In 2007, Sakamoto spent most of his rookie season () with the Giants' nigun team (Japanese for \\"minor league\\" or \\"farm team\\"). He played 77 games in the Western League, hitting .268 with five homers and 28 RBIs.\\"2008.4.7 NPB Power Rankings\\" Japan, Hockey, Baseball, etc Sakamoto saw his first call-up to the ichigun (major league) team in July and made his professional debut as a pinch runner on July 12.

Although Tomohiro Nioka, then the Giants' starting shortstop, returned from injury just before their season opener, Sakamoto's quick adjustment to second base, accompanied by left-hander Masanori Ishikawa's taking the mound for the opposing Tokyo Yakult Swallows, prompted Hara to start him in the season opener as the No. 8 hitter on March 28. Sakamoto became the first Giant to start a season opener while under the age of 20 since former New York Yankees outfielder Hideki Matsui did so in 1994.Gibson, John. \\"Teen Sakamoto taking Giant steps\\" The Yomiuri Shimbun Although Sakamoto was expected to platoon at second base with the likes of veteran journeyman Kimura Takuya and speedster Ryota Wakiya throughout the season, he returned to his natural position when Nioka tore his right calf muscle in that very game. Sakamoto started at shortstop from the second game onwards and never gave up the starting job.\\"Kamei, Sakamoto capitalize when given chance to shine with Giants\\" The Japan Times His first career home run came against the Hanshin Tigers on April 6, a grand slam off reliever Kenta Abe that made him the youngest player in Central League history (19 years, 114 days) to hit a grand slam in a regular season game.\\"Sakamoto hits slam as Giants win rout\\" The Japan Times He was also voted to the All- Star team that year,\\"Ichiro, Fukudome win All-Star squad places\\" The Japan Times getting his first hit in an All-Star game in Game 2 held at Yokohama Stadium on August 1.

The Giants lost Game 7 3-2, coming up short in their run for a Japan Series championship. Sakamoto also started all 144 games, becoming just the third player (and first in the Central League) to start every game of the season in one's second year out of high school (along with Futoshi Nakanishi and Kiyohara). Perhaps even more impressive was that if one were to include pre-season, All-Star, Climax Series (playoffs) and Japan Series games, Sakamoto played a grand total of 172 total games that year. Although the Central League Most Valuable Rookie award was presented to teammate and left- handed reliever Tetsuya Yamaguchi, who went 11-2 with a 2.32 ERA in 67 appearances, Sakamoto received a special award for his efforts. The Giants also rewarded him by giving him the uniform number 6.\\"Yomiuri Giants prepare to commemorate 75th anniversary in 2009\\" The Japan Times In 2009, Sakamoto got off to a good start to the season (his third in the pros and second at the major league level), hitting .376 with a league-leading 11 doubles and slugging .541 for the month of April.

In 2018, he was selected to his 10th All-Star Series and finished the regular season with a career-high .345 batting average. In 2019, Sakamoto won his first MVP award. He finished the regular season with a .312 batting average, 40 home runs and 94 RBI, and helped the Giants reach the 2019 Japan Series.

In the 2013 World Baseball Classic, he was the starting shortstop. Like most of his teammates, he had problems at the batting plate, as he was unable to hit for consistency during the pool rounds, though he had a crucial RBI single equalizer against Chinese Taipei in the bottom of the 8th of that game. Sakamoto seemed to regain his batting sense alongside his teammates in the 16-4 mulling of the Netherlands that qualified Team Japan to the semi-finals, hitting 2-5 in the game including a grand slam in the top of the 7th that gave Japan a more than 10 run lead needed to end the game early via mercy rule, securing an early ticket to the semis. However, Team Japan lost their semi-final match against Puerto Rico 3-1, thus finishing third and losing their two-time defending championship streak. On October 1, 2019, he was selected at the 2019 WBSC Premier12.

He is a spray hitter whose swing is characterized by a pronounced leg kick. Though the majority of his extra-base hits tend to be line drives into the alleys (37 doubles in 653 career at-bats as of May 13, 2009), many predict that Sakamoto will develop home run power as his body fills out. =Fielding= Sakamoto puts his superb athleticism (he was clocked at 6.0 seconds in the 50-meter dash and 110 meters in the long toss in high school) to good use in the field. Though he committed 15 errors in the field in his first season in the majors in 2008, he has very good range and has improved on his throwing tremendously since coming into the pros.

It was built between 1757 and 1774 on what was then known as place Louis XV, with a fa√ßade by Ange-Jacques Gabriel, First Architect to the King and designer of the square. The identical building to its west now houses the h√¥tel de Crillon. Background The construction was led by Jacques-Germain Soufflot. Its two pediments contain allegories of Magnificence and Felicity by Guillaume II Coustou and Michel-Ange Slodtz. The building originally belonged wholly to the Crown, at first being used by the Garde-Meuble, whose galleries were open to the public from 9 am to 1 pm on the first Tuesday of each month between Easter and All Saints' Day. It also housed a chapel, a library, workshops, stables and many apartments, including those of the intendant of the Garde-Meuble ‚Äì at first Pierre √âlisabeth de Fontanieu (1767‚Äì1784), then Marc-Antoine Thierry de Ville-d'Avray (1784‚Äì1792).

Thus, from 1789, it housed the naval ministry. Led by Admiral Decr√®s, the ministry considerably expanded its offices until it occupied the whole building. The magnificent interior decor by Jacques Gondouin, inspired by Piranesi, was an important step forward in 18th-century taste, but it was profoundly distorted by changes under the Second French Empire, although the grands salons d'apparat and the Galerie Dor√©e still maintain some of the original elements. After the fall of France in June of 1940, the Kriegsmarine, the naval forces of Nazi Germany set up their headquarters here, which would remain in place up until the Kriegsmarine had to evacuate its presence in the city in light of the deteriorating strategic position in August of 1944.

It initially received a mixed critical reception, but has now become accepted as a classic of modern Australian literature. The novel deals with the life of single-mother Nora, as she narrates her increasingly tumultuous relationship with a flaky heroin addict, juxtaposed with her raising a daughter while living in share houses in Melbourne during the late 1970s. A film based on the novel, also titled Monkey Grip, was released in 1982. In the 1990s, when critics identified the Australian literary genre of grunge lit, the book was retrospectively categorized as one of the first examples of this genre. The novel, published at the height of a burgeoning counterculture movement and bohemia scene in Melbourne, achieved some degree of notoriety for its astute, uncompromising depiction of heroin addiction, sexuality, relationships and love. It became recognised as being one of Australia's \\"first contemporary novels\\", and long since its initial publication, has come to be regarded as being the \\"voice of a generation\\". Furthermore, it helped establish the career of Helen Garner, who is now one of the most well-known writers in Australia. Garner later admitted that there was an autobiographical element to the novel, with much of its plot being diaristic and based on her own experiences. Despite dividing critics after its publication in 1977, the book sold very well. It was one of the first majorly successful works released by Melbourne publishing house McPhee Gribble. In 2018, Monkey Grip was selected by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) as number 47 of a list of \\"100 stories that shaped the world\\" ‚Äì the only Australian novel on the list. Plot summary Fitzroy baths, which many of the characters in Monkey Grip frequent during the hot summer days. The novel is set in the inner city suburbs of Melbourne in the mid 1970s. The characters inhabit a lively social circle, frequenting caf√©s, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, pubs and clubs in the city. Nora, a single mother in her thirties, and her young daughter Grace, live in a succession of share houses. Nora is in love with the notoriously unreliable Javo, a twentysomething heroin addict, who repeatedly drifts in and out of Nora's life. Other characters, including Rita, a single mother and Nora's housemate, Gerald, Francis, Joss, Bill, Willy, Claire, and Martin (a former flame of Nora's), also drift in and out of the story. Most of the characters are artists, actors and creative types; many of them frequent the Fitzroy baths in summer. Nora, a freelance journalist, takes small acting gigs in independent films and edits a women's newspaper between jobs to make ends meet. Nora's relationship with the flaky Javo is first put under strain when he is arrested in Bangkok for drug possession. As he returns, their relationship seems to ebb and flow: while, at a high point, the tentative couple, along with Nora's daughter Grace, go on trips across the country ‚Äì first to Hobart, then a road trip to Sydney ‚Äì at its lowest point, Javo steals from the share house to support his heroin habit and disappears for days on end, leaving Nora to wonder about his whereabouts and contemplate his return. As their relationship intensifies, Nora questions how much of herself will be left if she is wrenched away by a love that is doomed to end. As their relationship approaches eventual disintegration due to Javo's drug addiction, deception, and unsavoury behaviour, Nora takes a short trip to Anglesea to clear her mind. Around this time, Javo seduces Nora's friend Claire, while Nora - drained and depersonalised from their relationship - returns home, forced to start anew and contemplate her feelings about their fleeting, destructive love affair. Publication and title La Trobe Reading room. Much of the novel was based on Helen Garner's own experiences living in sharehouses in Fitzroy and Carlton in the mid 70s ‚Äì the relationship between Nora and Javo is based on a relationship Garner had during her time living in sharehousing while raising her daughter. Most of the novel was written in the Latrobe Reading Room at the State Library of Victoria. Upon completion, Garner took a manuscript to Colin Talbot at Outback Press. This early draft did not feature the love story between Nora and Javo. Talbot suggested Garner try to shape her writing into a narrative, fleshing out certain relationships she had written about. After making significant changes by inserting the romantic relationship between Nora and Javo, Garner finally sent a copy to McPhee Gribble, an independent publishing house in Melbourne run by two women, after it was rejected by one male editor at a large Melbourne publishing house for being \\"too emotional\\". Di Gribble of McPhee Gribble, the book's first publisher, wrote that the title of the novel referred to both a linking of hands and the monkey on your back of drug addiction. Themes Kerryn Goldsworthy writes that almost all of Garner's fiction addresses \\"the relationship between sexual behaviour and social organisation; the anarchic nature of desire and the orderly face of the institution of 'family'\\".Goldsworthy, Kerryn (1996) Australian Writers: Helen Garner, Melbourne, Oxford University Press, p. 28 The plot point of Nora's obsessive love for Javo is matched by Javo's addiction to heroin ‚Äì although the source of obsession is different for both people, it possesses a similarly destructive power over a person. Writer Jean-Fran√ßois Vernay opined in his book A Brief Take on the Australian Novel (2016) that though Garner was writing about a love affair, the novel, as well as the grunge literary genre it heralded, is not about love but rather \\"the disintegration of love\\", exploring the lives of alienated or romantically cynical city-dwellers who, in an attempt to escape the stressors and boredom of modern city life, indulge in reckless sexual behaviour which only provides them instant, short lived gratification over long-term meaningful, fulfilling couplings. The book makes numerous references to the sacred Chinese divination text I Ching, which Nora consults several times for guidance on her relationship with the unstable Javo. Critical reception Monkey Grip initially met with a mixed reception in Australia.Goldsworthy (1996) p. 1 Some critics praised Garner's writing, including Peter Corris, who called the writing \\"attractive and accessible, a pleasure to read\\" and further commented \\"[Garner] has the ability to capture movement and stillness and light and sound with words which belong to writers like E.M. Forster and, to give a different but appropriate example, Jack Kerouac\\". Since its release it has come to be regarded as a classic of modern Australian literature.Monkey Grip, Penguin Classics In 1978, Garner was awarded the Book of the Year Award by the National Book Council for Monkey Grip ‚Äì making her the first woman in Australia to win the award. The panel acknowledged that it was \\"not an easy choice\\", given that the book's subject matter included \\"heroin addiction, inner-city communal living and obsessional love\\". They further stated that the central character, Nora, is \\"superbly realised in her hesitancies and enthusiasms\\", that the book was \\"beautifully constructed\\", and that Garner had been \\"utterly honest in demonstrating the dilemmas of freedom, and particularly of social and sexual freedom for women trying to create for themselves a role which will recognise their full humanity\\". The novel was released internationally in Europe and the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was met with a modest acclaim there ‚Äì with the London Times writing \\"the actual force of the author's prose carries the novel along like a strong drink\\" and Vogue similarly praising the book for Garner's \\"deliberately laconic style\\", further stating she \\"renders her experiences with imagination to produce a novel that is chilling to read, cut and coloured with hard energy and strong feeling\\". =Legacy= In 1980, Monkey Grip was serialised for the Melbourne community radio station 3RRR with Garner reading the entire text of the novel on air, herself. It has been translated into several languages, including French and Italian. By the time of the release of the film adaptation, the novel had sold in excess of 100,000 copies. It has been taught in both high schools and universities. In 2018, the book was voted number 47 on a list of 100 stories that changed the world, \\"stories they felt had shaped mindsets or influenced history\\", by a survey of 108 \\"critics, scholars and journalists\\" polled by the BBC. During that same year, it was republished in a fortieth anniversary hardcover edition by Text Publishing, with an introduction by Charlotte Wood.

Many non-living substances such as fluids, hormones, and pheromones are also important accessories to the reproductive system. Introduction to the Reproductive System, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. Unlike most organ systems, the sexes of differentiated species often have significant differences. These differences allow for a combination of genetic material between two individuals, which allows for the possibility of greater genetic fitness of the offspring. Reproductive System 2001 Body Guide powered by Adam Animals In mammals, the major organs of the reproductive system include the external genitalia (penis and vulva) as well as a number of internal organs, including the gamete-producing gonads (testicles and ovaries). Diseases of the human reproductive system are very common and widespread, particularly communicable sexually transmitted diseases.STD's Today National Prevention Network, Center for Disease Control, United States Government, retrieving 2007 Most other vertebrates have generally similar reproductive systems consisting of gonads, ducts, and openings. However, there is a great diversity of physical adaptations as well as reproductive strategies in every group of vertebrates. =Vertebrates= Vertebrates share key elements of their reproductive systems. They all have gamete-producing organs known as gonads. In females, these gonads are then connected by oviducts to an opening to the outside of the body, typically the cloaca, but sometimes to a unique pore such as a vagina or intromittent organ.  Humans  The human reproductive system usually involves internal fertilization by sexual intercourse. During this process, the male inserts his erect penis into the female's vagina and ejaculates semen, which contains sperm. The sperm then travels through the vagina and cervix into the uterus or fallopian tubes for fertilization of the ovum. Upon successful fertilization and implantation, gestation of the fetus then occurs within the female's uterus for approximately nine months, this process is known as pregnancy in humans. Gestation ends with childbirth, delivery following labor. Labor consists of the muscles of the uterus contracting, the cervix dilating, and the baby passing out the vagina (the female genital organ). Human's babies and children are nearly helpless and require high levels of parental care for many years. One important type of parental care is the use of the mammary glands in the female breasts to nurse the baby.Sexual Reproduction in Humans. 2006. John W. Kimball. Kimball's Biology Pages, and online textbook. The female reproductive system has two functions: The first is to produce egg cells, and the second is to protect and nourish the offspring until birth. The male reproductive system has one function, and it is to produce and deposit sperm. Humans have a high level of sexual differentiation. In addition to differences in nearly every reproductive organ, numerous differences typically occur in secondary sexual characteristics. =Male= The male reproductive system is a series of organs located outside of the body and around the pelvic region of a male that contribute towards the reproduction process. The primary direct function of the male reproductive system is to provide the male sperm for fertilization of the ovum. The major reproductive organs of the male can be grouped into three categories. The first category is sperm production and storage. Production takes place in the testes which are housed in the temperature regulating scrotum, immature sperm then travel to the epididymis for development and storage. The second category are the ejaculatory fluid producing glands which include the seminal vesicles, prostate, and the vas deferens. The final category are those used for copulation, and deposition of the spermatozoa (sperm) within the male, these include the penis, urethra, vas deferens, and Cowper's gland. Major secondary sexual characteristics includes: larger, more muscular stature, deepened voice, facial and body hair, broad shoulders, and development of an Adam's apple. An important sexual hormone of males is androgen, and particularly testosterone. The testes release a hormone that controls the development of sperm. This hormone is also responsible for the development of physical characteristics in men such as facial hair and a deep voice. =Female= The human female reproductive system is a series of organs primarily located inside of the body and around the pelvic region of a female that contribute towards the reproductive process. The human female reproductive system contains three main parts: the vulva, which leads to the vagina, the vaginal opening, to the uterus; the uterus, which holds the developing fetus; and the ovaries, which produce the female's ova. The breasts are involved during the parenting stage of reproduction, but in most classifications they are not considered to be part of the female reproductive system. The vagina meets the outside at the vulva, which also includes the labia, clitoris and urethra; during intercourse this area is lubricated by mucus secreted by the Bartholin's glands. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the fallopian tubes. Each ovary contains hundreds of ova (singular ovum). Approximately every 28 days, the pituitary gland releases a hormone that stimulates some of the ova to develop and grow. One ovum is released and it passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. Hormones produced by the ovaries prepare the uterus to receive the ovum. It sita her and awaits the sperm for fertilization to occur. When this does not occur i.e. no sperm for fertilization, the lining of the uterus, called the endometrium, and unfertilized ova are shed each cycle through the process of menstruation. If the ovum is fertilized by sperm, it attaches to the endometrium and the fetus develops.  Other mammals  joey suckles from a teat found within its mother's pouch Didactic model of a mammal urogenital system. Most mammal reproductive systems are similar, however, there are some notable differences between the non-human mammals and humans. For instance, most male mammals have a penis which is stored internally until erect, and most have a penis bone or baculum.Schultz, Nicholas G., et al. \\"The baculum was gained and lost multiple times during mammalian evolution.\\" Integrative and comparative biology 56.4 (2016): 644-656. Additionally, males of most species do not remain continually sexually fertile as humans do. Like humans, most groups of mammals have descended testicles found within a scrotum, however, others have descended testicles that rest on the ventral body wall, and a few groups of mammals, such as elephants, have undescended testicles found deep within their body cavities near their kidneys. The reproductive system of marsupials is unique in that the female has two vaginae, both of which open externally through one orifice but lead to different compartments within the uterus; males usually have a two-pronged penis, which corresponds to the females' two vaginae. Marsupials typically develop their offspring in an external pouch containing teats to which their newborn young (joeys) attach themselves for post uterine development. Also, marsupials have a unique prepenial scrotum. The 15mm (5/8 in) long newborn joey instinctively crawls and wriggles the several inches (15 cm), while clinging to fur, on the way to its mother's pouch. The uterus and vagina are unique to mammals with no homologue in birds, reptiles, amphibians, or fish. In place of the uterus the other vertebrate groups have an unmodified oviduct leading directly to a cloaca, which is a shared exit-hole for gametes, urine, and feces. Monotremes (i.e. platypus and echidnas), a group of egg- laying mammals, also lack a uterus and vagina, and in that respect have a reproductive system resembling that of a reptile. =Dogs= In domestic canines, sexual maturity (puberty) occurs between the ages of 6 to 12 months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds. =Horses= The mare's reproductive system is responsible for controlling gestation, birth, and lactation, as well as her estrous cycle and mating behavior. The stallion's reproductive system is responsible for his sexual behavior and secondary sex characteristics (such as a large crest). Birds Male and female birds have a cloaca, an opening through which eggs, sperm, and wastes pass. Intercourse is performed by pressing the lips of the cloacae together, which is sometimes known as intromittent organ which is known as a phallus that is analogous to the mammals' penis. The female lays amniotic eggs in which the young fetus continues to develop after it leaves the female's body. Unlike most vertebrates female birds typically have only one functional ovary and oviduct.Ritchison. BIO 554/754 Ornithology. Eastern Kentucky University. As a group, birds, like mammals, are noted for their high level of parental care.  Reptiles  Reptiles are almost all sexually dimorphic, and exhibit internal fertilization through the cloaca. Some reptiles lay eggs while others are ovoviviparous (animals that deliver live young). Reproductive organs are found within the cloaca of reptiles. Most male reptiles have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis-like organ, while male snakes and lizards each possess a pair of penis-like organs. A male common frog in nuptial colors waiting for more females to come in a mass of spawn  Amphibians  Most amphibians exhibit external fertilization of eggs, typically within the water, though some amphibians such as caecilians have internal fertilization. All have paired, internal gonads, connected by ducts to the cloaca.  Fish  Fish exhibit a wide range of different reproductive strategies. Most fish, however, are oviparous and exhibit external fertilization. In this process, females use their cloaca to release large quantities of their gametes, called spawn into the water and one or more males release \\"milt\\", a white fluid containing many sperm over the unfertilized eggs. Other species of fish are oviparous and have internal fertilization aided by pelvic or anal fins that are modified into an intromittent organ analogous to the human penis.Fish Reproduction A small portion of fish species are either viviparous or ovoviviparous, and are collectively known as livebearers.Science, Biology, and Terminology of Fish reproduction: Reproductive modes and strategies-part 1. 2002. MARTIN MOE. THE BREEDER'S NET Online Magazine Fish gonads are typically pairs of either ovaries or testes. Most fish are sexually dimorphic but some species are hermaphroditic or unisexual.Bony Fish Reproduction 2002. SeaWorld/Busch Gardens Animal Information Database. =Invertebrates= Invertebrates have an extremely diverse array of reproductive systems, the only commonality may be that they all lay eggs. Also, aside from cephalopods and arthropods, nearly all other invertebrates are hermaphroditic and exhibit external fertilization. Cephalopods All cephalopods are sexually dimorphic and reproduce by laying eggs. Most cephalopods have semi-internal fertilization, in which the male places his gametes inside the female's mantle cavity or pallial cavity to fertilize the ova found in the female's single ovary.Cephalopods. The Living World of Molluscs. Robert Nordsieck. Likewise, male cephalopods have only a single testicle. In the female of most cephalopods the nidamental glands aid in development of the egg. The \\"penis\\" in most unshelled male cephalopods (Coleoidea) is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified arm called a hectocotylus. That in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the \\"penis\\" is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfer the spermatophores directly to the female. Insects Most insects reproduce oviparously, i.e. by laying eggs. The eggs are produced by the female in a pair of ovaries. Sperm, produced by the male in one testis or more commonly two, is transmitted to the female during mating by means of external genitalia. The sperm is stored within the female in one or more spermathecae. At the time of fertilization, the eggs travel along oviducts to be fertilized by the sperm and are then expelled from the body (\\"laid\\"), in most cases via an ovipositor. Arachnids Arachnids may have one or two gonads, which are located in the abdomen. The genital opening is usually located on the underside of the second abdominal segment. In most species, the male transfers sperm to the female in a package, or spermatophore. Complex courtship rituals have evolved in many arachnids to ensure the safe delivery of the sperm to the female. Arachnids usually lay yolky eggs, which hatch into immatures that resemble adults. Scorpions, however, are either ovoviviparous or viviparous, depending on species, and bear live young. Plants Among all living organisms, flowers, which are the reproductive structures of angiosperms, are the most varied physically and show a correspondingly great diversity in methods of reproduction. Plants that are not flowering plants (green algae, mosses, liverworts, hornworts, ferns and gymnosperms such as conifers) also have complex interplays between morphological adaptation and environmental factors in their sexual reproduction. The breeding system, or how the sperm from one plant fertilizes the ovum of another, depends on the reproductive morphology, and is the single most important determinant of the genetic structure of nonclonal plant populations. Christian Konrad Sprengel (1793) studied the reproduction of flowering plants and for the first time it was understood that the pollination process involved both biotic and abiotic interactions. Fungi Fungal reproduction is complex, reflecting the differences in lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms.Alexopoulos et al., pp. 48‚Äì56. It is estimated that a third of all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the life cycle of a species, the teleomorph and the anamorph.Kirk et al., p. 633. Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing propagules.

The wasps do not constitute a clade, a complete natural group with a single ancestor, as their common ancestor is shared by bees and ants. Many wasps, those in the clade Aculeata, can sting their insect prey. The most commonly known wasps, such as yellowjackets and hornets, are in the family Vespidae and are eusocial, living together in a nest with an egg-laying queen and non-reproducing workers. Eusociality is favoured by the unusual haplodiploid system of sex determination in Hymenoptera, as it makes sisters exceptionally closely related to each other. However, the majority of wasp species are solitary, with each adult female living and breeding independently. Females typically have an ovipositor for laying eggs in or near a food source for the larvae, though in the Aculeata the ovipositor is often modified instead into a sting used for defense or prey capture. Wasps play many ecological roles. Some are predators or pollinators, whether to feed themselves or to provision their nests. Many, notably the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites, laying eggs in the nests of other wasps. Many of the solitary wasps are parasitoidal, meaning they lay eggs on or in other insects (any life stage from egg to adult) and often provision their own nests with such hosts. Unlike true parasites, the wasp larvae eventually kill their hosts. Solitary wasps parasitize almost every pest insect, making wasps valuable in horticulture for biological pest control of species such as whitefly in tomatoes and other crops. Wasps first appeared in the fossil record in the Jurassic, and diversified into many surviving superfamilies by the Cretaceous. They are a successful and diverse group of insects with tens of thousands of described species; wasps have spread to all parts of the world except for the polar regions. The largest social wasp is the Asian giant hornet, at up to in length; among the largest solitary wasps is a group of species known as tarantula hawks, along with the giant scoliid of Indonesia (Megascolia procer). The smallest wasps are solitary chalcid wasps in the family Mymaridae, including the world's smallest known insect, with a body length of only , and the smallest known flying insect, only long. Wasps have appeared in literature from Classical times, as the eponymous chorus of old men in Aristophanes' 422 BC comedy (), The Wasps, and in science fiction from H. G. Wells's 1904 novel The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth, featuring giant wasps with three-inch-long stings. The name \\"Wasp\\" has been used for many warships and other military equipment. Taxonomy and phylogeny Wasps are paraphyletic, consisting of the clade Apocrita without ants and bees, which are not usually considered to be wasps. The Hymenoptera also contain the somewhat wasplike Symphyta, the sawflies. The familiar common wasps and yellowjackets belong to one family, the Vespidae. =Paraphyletic grouping= The wasps are a cosmopolitan paraphyletic grouping of hundreds of thousands of species, consisting of the narrow-waisted clade Apocrita without the ants and bees. The Hymenoptera also contain the somewhat wasplike but unwaisted Symphyta, the sawflies. The term wasp is sometimes used more narrowly for members of the Vespidae, which includes several eusocial wasp lineages, such as yellowjackets (the genera Vespula and Dolichovespula), hornets (genus Vespa), and members of the subfamily Polistinae. =Fossils= Male Electrostephanus petiolatus fossil from the Middle Eocene, preserved in Baltic amber Hymenoptera in the form of Symphyta (Xyelidae) first appeared in the fossil record in the Lower Triassic. Apocrita, wasps in the broad sense, appeared in the Jurassic, and had diversified into many of the extant superfamilies by the Cretaceous; they appear to have evolved from the Symphyta. Fig wasps with modern anatomical features first appeared in the Lower Cretaceous of the Crato Formation in Brazil, some 65 million years before the first fig trees. The Vespidae include the extinct genus Palaeovespa, seven species of which are known from the Eocene rocks of the Florissant fossil beds of Colorado and from fossilised Baltic amber in Europe. Also found in Baltic amber are crown wasps of the genus Electrostephanus. =Diversity= Wasps are a diverse group, estimated at well over a hundred thousand described species around the world, and a great many more as yet undescribed. For example, almost every one of some 1000 species of tropical fig trees has its own specific fig wasp (Chalcidoidea) that has co-evolved with it and pollinates it. Many wasp species are parasitoids; the females deposit eggs on or in a host arthropod on which the larvae then feed. Some larvae start off as parasitoids, but convert at a later stage to consuming the plant tissues that their host is feeding on. In other species, the eggs are laid directly into plant tissues and form galls, which protect the developing larvae from predators but not necessarily from other parasitic wasps. In some species, the larvae are predatory themselves; the wasp eggs are deposited in clusters of eggs laid by other insects, and these are then consumed by the developing wasp larvae. The largest social wasp is the Asian giant hornet, at up to in length. The various tarantula hawk wasps are of a similar size and can overpower a spider many times its own weight, and move it to its burrow, with a sting that is excruciatingly painful to humans. The solitary giant scoliid, Megascolia procer, with a wingspan of 11.5 cm, has subspecies in Sumatra and Java; it is a parasitoid of the Atlas beetle Chalcosoma atlas. The female giant ichneumon wasp Megarhyssa macrurus is long including its very long but slender ovipositor which is used for boring into wood and inserting eggs. The smallest wasps are solitary chalcid wasps in the family Mymaridae, including the world's smallest known insect, Dicopomorpha echmepterygis (139 micrometres long) and Kikiki huna with a body length of only 158 micrometres, the smallest known flying insect. There are estimated to be 100,000 species of ichneumonoid wasps in the families Braconidae and Ichneumonidae. These are almost exclusively parasitoids, mostly utilising other insects as hosts. Another family, the Pompilidae, is a specialist parasitoid of spiders. Some wasps are even parasitoids of parasitoids; the eggs of Euceros are laid beside lepidopteran larvae and the wasp larvae feed temporarily on their haemolymph, but if a parasitoid emerges from the host, the hyperparasites continue their life cycle inside the parasitoid. Parasitoids maintain their extreme diversity through narrow specialism. In Peru, 18 wasp species were found living on 14 fly species in only two species of Gurania climbing squash.

Sociality =Social wasps= Social wasps constructing a paper nest Of the dozens of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae contains social species, primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non- stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial M√ºllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly wood pulp) as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibres are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as Dolichovespula media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; Protopolybia exigua attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like Agelaia multipicta and Vespula germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions. =Solitary wasps= Potter wasp building mud nest, France. The latest ring of mud is still wet. The vast majority of wasp species are solitary insects. Having mated, the adult female forages alone and if it builds a nest, does so for the benefit of its own offspring. Some solitary wasps nest in small groups alongside others of their species, but each is involved in caring for its own offspring (except for such actions as stealing other wasps‚Äô prey or laying in other wasp's nests). There are some species of solitary wasp that build communal nests, each insect having its own cell and providing food for its own offspring, but these wasps do not adopt the division of labour and the complex behavioural patterns adopted by eusocial species. Adult solitary wasps spend most of their time in preparing their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees or against walls. Predatory wasp species normally subdue their prey by stinging it, and then either lay their eggs on it, leaving it in place, or carry it back to their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to feed a single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and lay their eggs in the nests of unrelated host species. Biology =Anatomy= European hornet, Vespa crabro Like all insects, wasps have a hard exoskeleton which protects their three main body parts, the head, the mesosoma (including the thorax and the first segment of the abdomen) and the metasoma. There is a narrow waist, the petiole, joining the first and second segments of the abdomen. The two pairs of membranous wings are held together by small hooks and the forewings are larger than the hind ones; in some species, the females have no wings. In females there is usually a rigid ovipositor which may be modified for injecting venom, piercing or sawing. It either extends freely or can be retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defence and for paralysing prey. In addition to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar. The larvae of wasps resemble maggots, and are adapted for life in a protected environment; this may be the body of a host organism or a cell in a nest, where the larva either eats the provisions left for it or, in social species, is fed by the adults. Such larvae have soft bodies with no limbs, and have a blind gut (presumably so that they do not foul their cell). =Diet= Sand wasp Bembix oculata (Crabronidae) feeding on a fly after paralysing it with its sting Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, but the majority of their time is taken up by foraging for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning). Predatory and parasitoidal wasps subdue their prey by stinging it. They hunt a wide variety of prey, mainly other insects (including other Hymenoptera), both larvae and adults. The Pompilidae specialize in catching spiders to provision their nests. Spider wasp (Pompilidae) dragging a jumping spider (Salticidae) to provision a nest Some social wasps are omnivorous, feeding on fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps sometimes visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to locations where they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly consumed by the adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein- building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins). =Sex determination= In wasps, as in other Hymenoptera, sex is determined by a haplodiploid system, which means that females are unusually closely related to their sisters, enabling kin selection to favour the evolution of eusocial behaviour. Females are diploid, meaning that they have 2n chromosomes and develop from fertilized eggs. Males, called drones, have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes and develop from an unfertilized egg. Wasps store sperm inside their body and control its release for each individual egg as it is laid; if a female wishes to produce a male egg, she simply lays the egg without fertilizing it. Therefore, under most conditions in most species, wasps have complete voluntary control over the sex of their offspring. Experimental infection of Muscidifurax uniraptor with the bacterium Wolbachia induced thelytokous reproduction and an inability to produce fertile, viable male offspring. =Inbreeding avoidance= Females of the solitary wasp parasitoid Venturia canescens can avoid mating with their brothers through kin recognition. In experimental comparisons, the probability that a female will mate with an unrelated male was about twice as high as the chance of her mating with brothers. Female wasps appear to recognize siblings on the basis of a chemical signature carried or emitted by males. Sibling- mating avoidance reduces inbreeding depression that is largely due to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations. Ecology =As pollinators= While the vast majority of wasps play no role in pollination, a few species can effectively transport pollen and pollinate several plant species. Since wasps generally do not have a fur-like covering of soft hairs and a special body part for pollen storage (pollen basket) as some bees do, pollen does not stick to them well. However it has been shown that even without hairs, several wasp species are able to effectively transport pollen, therefore contributing for potential pollination of several plant species. Pollen wasps in the subfamily Masarinae gather nectar and pollen in a crop inside their bodies, rather than on body hairs like bees, and pollinate flowers of Penstemon and the water leaf family, Hydrophyllaceae. The Agaonidae (fig wasps) are the only pollinators of nearly 1000 species of figs, and thus are crucial to the survival of their host plants. Since the wasps are equally dependent on their fig trees for survival, the coevolved relationship is fully mutualistic. =As parasitoids= Most solitary wasps are parasitoids. As adults, those that do feed typically only take nectar from flowers. Parasitoid wasps are extremely diverse in habits, many laying their eggs in inert stages of their host (egg or pupa), sometimes paralysing their prey by injecting it with venom through their ovipositor. They then insert one or more eggs into the host or deposit them upon the outside of the host. The host remains alive until the parasitoid larvae pupate or emerge as adults. The Ichneumonidae are specialized parasitoids, often of Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried in plant tissues, which may be woody. For this purpose, they have exceptionally long ovipositors; they detect their hosts by smell and vibration. Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, parasitise horntails, large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's immune system and replicates in the oviduct of the female wasp. One family of chalcid wasps, the Eucharitidae, has specialized as parasitoids of ants, most species hosted by one genus of ant. Eucharitids are among the few parasitoids that have been able to overcome ants' effective defences against parasitoids. =As parasites= Many species of wasp, including especially the cuckoo or jewel wasps (Chrysididae), are kleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other wasp species to exploit their parental care. Most such species attack hosts that provide provisions for their immature stages (such as paralyzed prey items), and they either consume the provisions intended for the host larva, or wait for the host to develop and then consume it before it reaches adulthood. An example of a true brood parasite is the paper wasp Polistes sulcifer, which lays its eggs in the nests of other paper wasps (specifically Polistes dominula), and whose larvae are then fed directly by the host. Sand wasps Ammophila often save time and energy by parasitising the nests of other females of their own species, either kleptoparasitically stealing prey, or as brood parasites, removing the other female's egg from the prey and laying their own in its place. According to Emery's rule, social parasites, especially among insects, tend to parasitise species or genera to which they are closely related. For example, the social wasp Dolichovespula adulterina parasitises other members of its genus such as D. norwegica and D. arenaria. =As predators= Many wasp lineages, including those in the families Vespidae, Crabronidae, Sphecidae, and Pompilidae, attack and sting prey items that they use as food for their larvae; while Vespidae usually macerate their prey and feed the resulting bits directly to their brood, most predatory wasps paralyze their prey and lay eggs directly upon the bodies, and the wasp larvae consume them. Apart from collecting prey items to provision their young, many wasps are also opportunistic feeders, and will suck the body fluids of their prey. Although vespid mandibles are adapted for chewing and they appear to be feeding on the organism, they are often merely macerating it into submission. The impact of the predation of wasps on economic pests is difficult to establish. The roughly 140 species of beewolf (Philanthinae) hunt bees, including honeybees, to provision their nests; the adults feed on nectar and pollen. =As models for mimics= With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, social wasps are the models for many species of mimic. Two common cases are Batesian mimicry, where the mimic is harmless and is essentially bluffing, and M√ºllerian mimicry, where the mimic is also distasteful, and the mimicry can be considered mutual. Batesian mimics of wasps include many species of hoverfly and the wasp beetle. Many species of wasp are involved in M√ºllerian mimicry, as are many species of bee. =As prey= While wasp stings deter many potential predators, bee-eaters (in the bird family Meropidae) specialise in eating stinging insects, making aerial sallies from a perch to catch them, and removing the venom from the stinger by repeatedly brushing the prey firmly against a hard object, such as a twig. The honey buzzard attacks the nests of social hymenopterans, eating wasp larvae; it is the only known predator of the dangerous Asian giant hornet or \\"yak- killer\\" (Vespa mandarinia). Likewise, roadrunners are the only real predators of tarantula hawk wasps.

File:Pair of Merops apiaster feeding detail.jpgBee-eaters such as Merops apiaster specialise in feeding on bees and wasps. Relationship with humans =As pests= Social wasps are considered pests when they become excessively common, or nest close to buildings. People are most often stung in late summer, when wasp colonies stop breeding new workers; the existing workers search for sugary foods and are more likely to come into contact with humans; if people then respond aggressively, the wasps sting. Wasp nests made in or near houses, such as in roof spaces, can present a danger as the wasps may sting if people come close to them. Stings are usually painful rather than dangerous, but in rare cases, people may suffer life-threatening anaphylactic shock. =In horticulture= Some species of parasitic wasp, especially in the Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid of a range of species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, and to a lesser extent of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach- potato aphid. File:Encarsia formosa, an endoparasitic wasp, is used for whitefly control.jpgEncarsia formosa, a parasitoid, is sold commercially for biological control of whitefly, an insect pest of tomato and other horticultural crops.

The club's first kit is black with yellow stripes. The club has an amateur side called Wasps FC. Among the other clubs bearing the name are a basketball club in Wantirna, Australia, and Alloa Athletic F.C., a football club in Scotland. =In fashion= Wasp waist, c. 1900, demonstrated by Polaire, a French actress famous for this silhouette Wasps have been modelled in jewellery since at least the nineteenth century, when diamond and emerald wasp brooches were made in gold and silver settings. A fashion for wasp waisted female silhouettes with sharply cinched waistlines emphasizing the wearer's hips and bust arose repeatedly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. =In literature= The Ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes wrote the comedy play Œ£œÜ·øÜŒ∫ŒµœÇ (Sphƒìkes), The Wasps, first put on in 422 BC. The \\"wasps\\" are the chorus of old jurors. H. G. Wells made use of giant wasps in his novel The Food of the Gods and How It Came to Earth (1904): Detail of Botticelli's Venus and Mars, 1485, with a wasp's nest on right, probably a symbol of the Vespucci family (Italian vespa, wasp) who commissioned the painting. Wasp (1957) is a science fiction book by the English writer Eric Frank Russell; it is generally considered Russell's best novel. In Stieg Larsson's book The Girl Who Played with Fire (2006) and its film adaptation, Lisbeth Salander has adopted her kickboxing ringname, \\"The Wasp\\", as her hacker handle and has a wasp tattoo on her neck, indicating her high status among hackers, unlike her real world situation, and that like a small but painfully stinging wasp, she could be dangerous. Parasitoidal wasps played an indirect role in the nineteenth- century evolution debate. The Ichneumonidae contributed to Charles Darwin's doubts about the nature and existence of a well-meaning and all-powerful Creator. In an 1860 letter to the American naturalist Asa Gray, Darwin wrote: =In military names= , one of nine Royal Navy warships to bear the name With its powerful sting and familiar appearance, the wasp has given its name to many ships, aircraft and military vehicles. Nine ships and one shore establishment of the Royal Navy have been named , the first an 8-gun sloop launched in 1749. Eleven ships of the United States Navy have similarly borne the name , the first a merchant schooner acquired by the Continental Navy in 1775. The eighth of these, an aircraft carrier, gained two Second World War battle stars, prompting Winston Churchill to remark \\"Who said a Wasp couldn't sting twice?\\" In the Second World War, a German self-propelled howitzer was named Wespe, while the British developed the Wasp flamethrower from the Bren Gun Carrier. In aerospace, the Westland Wasp was a military helicopter developed in England in 1958 and used by the Royal Navy and other navies. The AeroVironment Wasp III is a miniature UAV developed for United States Air Force special operations.

The shelter was built to house scientists who used the 14,505-foot summit to study high-altitude phenomena in the time before sustained high-altitude flight was possible. In 1909 the site was used by Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory director Charles Greeley Abbot to conduct spectroscopic observations of Mars to investigate the existence of water on the planet. Other studies included observations of cosmic rays and nocturnal radiation. Although the structure was built in part as a shelter from storms, hikers are now warned against seeking shelter there during lightning storms. Landmark Gustave F.

Biography Shidei was born to a samurai-class family in Yamashina, Kyoto prefecture. He attended military preparatory schools in Osaka and Tokyo and graduated from the 27th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1915. He served as a junior officer with a cavalry company in the IJA 23rd Infantry Regiment. In 1922, he graduated from the 34th class of the Army Staff College. He subsequently served as an instructor at the Army cavalry School as a military attache to Germany, and as an instructor at the Army Staff College. From August 1935 to March 1939, he served as an Aide-de-camp to the Emperor of Japan. In August 1937, he was promoted to colonel. In March 1939, Shidei was commander of the IJA 23rd Infantry Regiment. He was reassigned as an instructor at the Army Staff College from March 1940, and then as head of its Research Bureau from July 1940. He was promoted to major general in August 1940. Recalled to combat duty in December 1942, Shidei served as Chief of Staff of the Japanese First Area Army, based in Manchukuo, He remained in this position to October 1944, when he was reassigned to take command of newly- formed IJA 94th Division. This division was raised in Taiping, Perak to bolster Japanese defences in Malaya after the Japanese Army's defeat at the Battle of Imphal. The division was to be used to defend Malaya against the expected Operation Zipper, and took a defensive positions on the north of Malaysia. In May 1945, Shidei was reassigned to command the Japanese Burma Area Army after the disastrous losses at the Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay and in Operation Dracula, but was recalled to Manchukuo in July 1945 to become Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. Shidei died in a plane crash with Subhas Chandra Bose, when the Mitsubishi Ki-21 bomber they were in exploded and crashed at Taipei Songshan Airport shortly after takeoff on August 18, 1945, a few days after the official surrender of Japan. Shidei and Bose were en route to Dairen, where Bose intended to speak with negotiators from the Soviet Union about political asylum and turning over control of the Indian National Army to the Soviets to continue the struggle for Indian independence. Shidei was to have served as the main liaison and negotiator for Bose. Conspiracy theories that the crash was not an accident appeared within hours of their deaths.

Club career Buhtz began his playing career at Fortuna Magdeburg where he played for the senior team aged 16, after a special permit had been obtained. After the war, Buhtz left the Soviet occupation zone and went to play for Kickers Offenbach, winning a South German championship with the team in 1949. In 1950 he was part of the Offenbach team that lost to VfB Stuttgart in the German football championship final. Between 1950 and 1952 he played for VfB M√ºhlburg in the Oberliga S√ºd, then the highest level of football in the area. In his five years in that league, Buhtz managed to score 69 goals in 143 matches. In 1952, Buhtz became the second German to play in Italy's Serie A ‚Äì the first had been 1860 Munich's Ludwig Janda. For five years, \\"il tedesco\\" (the German), as the fans called him, would play for AC Torino, earning as much as 150,000 DM per season, an amount of money that a player in Germany \\"would have had to play a decade for\\". Buhtz was one of the stars of the newly formed Torino team that had to be rebuilt after 18 players had died in the Superga air disaster in 1949. Buhtz quickly became a regular and scored about 20 goals per season. In 1957, he left Torino for Switzerland, where he was player-manager for FC Young Fellows in Zurich and AC Bellinzona. As Buhtz was similar in playing style to Fritz Walter and the German FA disapproved of professional players, especially if they were playing abroad, Buhtz never played in a match for Germany.  Managerial career  After his playing career, Buhtz became a full-time manager. This development was already on the horizon when he was player- manager in Switzerland. Between 1962 and 1985, Buhtz went on to manage 13 clubs in Germany and Turkey. =Saarbr√ºcken and Neunkirchen= He began his managing career at Oberliga S√ºdwest club Sportfreunde Saarbr√ºcken and led them to a respectable 6th place. After the season, he signed a contract with Borussia Neunkirchen who had finished second in the 1962‚Äì63 season and were controversially omitted from the newly formed Bundesliga. Buhtz' team won the Regionalliga S√ºd in 1964 and they were thus promoted to the Bundesliga. After finishing mid-table in their first season, the team was relegated following a 17th place in 1966. =Hannover 96= Following the relegation, Buhtz left the club and took over as manager of Hannover 96, another Bundesliga side. With Hannover, Buhtz reached a 9th place in 1967 but was fired on 12 February 1968. Buhtz' work at Hannover had suffered from the fact that in October 1967 the club had already signed a new manager for the 1968‚Äì69 season. =Wuppertaler SV= In July, Buhtz became manager of Regionalliga West side Wuppertaler SV, the club he would manage for the following six years. However, the relationship got off to a rocky start, when Buhtz was not present for the start of training on 9 July 1968, despite having set the date himself. Under Buhtz the club constantly improved, eventually winning the league and qualifying for the Bundesliga promotion play-offs, in which Wuppertal won all eight of their matches, a feat unmatched in all eleven seasons featuring that playoff format. After promotion, Buhtz extended his contract until 1 July 1975. In their first year, Wuppertal finished on a sensational fourth place and qualified for the UEFA Cup, where they would go on to succumb to a first- round aggregate defeat by Polish side Ruch Chorz√≥w. In the second year, however, the team could no longer keep up their performance, only barely avoiding relegation with a 2‚Äì2 draw at VfB Stuttgart on the final day of the season. The third year started out even worse, and Buhtz was sacked ten games into the season on 20 October 1974 after a 4‚Äì1 loss at Hamburger SV. Despite that, Buhtz's only win of the 1974‚Äì75 campaign became a memorable one, as WSV managed to defeat the defending German champions and European Cup winners Bayern Munich who were having a disappointing domestic campaign despite eventually managing to defend their European Cup title. After Buhtz's departure, Wuppertal still only managed one more victory and were relegated with the second-worst record in Bundesliga history to date. =Be≈üikta≈ü and Dortmund= At the end of the year Buhtz went to Turkey and took over Be≈üikta≈ü J.K. with a contract running until June 1975. With Be≈üikta≈ü he finished 5th in the league, but the club won the Turkish Cup for the first time. Originally, Buhtz had intended to return to the Bundesliga in July 1975, but instead stayed on as Be≈üikta≈ü manager. However, in January 1976, Buhtz was sacked and in February took over as manager of then 2. Bundesliga Nord side Borussia Dortmund. This was not intended as a long-time assignment and in April that year Buhtz signed a two-year contract as manager of 1. FC N√ºrnberg, starting in June. Buhtz led Dortmund to a second place in the league, allowing them to take part in the promotion play-offs against the second-placed team of 2. Bundesliga S√ºd: 1. FC N√ºrnberg. In view of the fact that Buhtz had already signed a contract with N√ºrnberg for the next season, he was sacked before the play-offs. =1. FC N√ºrnberg and Bayer Uerdingen= At N√ºrnberg, Buhtz reached only a fifth place in 2. Bundesliga S√ºd in 1976‚Äì77, but in the following season the club finished second and qualified for the play-offs on the 37th day of the season. However, like in Dortmund, Buhtz was sacked before the play-offs began. His next station was 2. Bundesliga S√ºd side Bayer 05 Uerdingen where he took over in October 1978. Again he finished second in the league, and this time was not sacked before the play-offs, but instead celebrated promotion to the Bundesliga in 1979. However, Uerdingen did not play a great role in the Bundesliga. They finished 15th in 1979‚Äì80 and an 18th place in 1980‚Äì81 meant relegation. Two matchdays before the end of the season, Buhtz was sacked. =Alemannia Aachen, Stuttgarter Kickers and Fortuna K√∂ln= In December 1981, Buhtz was the fourth manager brought in at Alemannia Aachen. Aachen were in eighth position when Buhtz took over, but he could not noticeably improve their position and finished ninth. In the following season Aachen started well, but after a slump in results, the club lost touch with the promotion ranks and Buhtz was sacked. In January 1983, 2. Bundesliga side Stuttgarter Kickers signed Buhtz on a contract running until June of that year. Buhtz won his first match, but in the long run he could not get the club out of their 2. Bundesliga dejection. After a catastrophic beginning of the 1983‚Äì84 season with only one win in 13 matches, Buhtz was dismissed on 22 October 1984. After his spell in Stuttgart, where Buhtz had worked with future stars such as J√ºrgen Klinsmann or Guido Buchwald, he all but retired, only taking over at 2. Bundesliga side Fortuna K√∂ln for a few months in the 1986‚Äì87 season. =Retirement= Buhtz lived in the town of Langenfeld, Rhineland, between Cologne and D√ºsseldorf. His original club of Fortuna Magdeburg made him an honorary president in 1992. He died at the age of 91 on 22 March 2015.http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/horst-buhtz-ist-tot-a-1024945.html  References  German footballers German football managers Kickers Offenbach players Karlsruher SC players Torino F.C. players Serie A players AC Bellinzona players AC Bellinzona managers Hannover 96 managers S√ºper Lig managers Be≈üikta≈ü J.K. managers German expatriate footballers Expatriate footballers in Italy Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Borussia Dortmund managers 1.

As player he won the championship of the German Democratic Republic of 1952 with Turbine Halle, today known as Hallescher FC. Between 1963 until his retirement in December 1973 he coached in the German Bundesliga and second division. Major successes were the promotions to the Bundesliga attained with Eintracht Braunschweig and Borussia Dortmund, albeit with the latter he was dismissed before the end of the season. Notably, they were placed fourth in the Bundesliga with Braunschweig in 1971 and placed sixth with MSV Duisburg in 1978, which was the second-best placing ever for the club.  Career  In 1963 he commenced his coaching career with SV Saar 05 Saarbr√ºcken in the southwest division of the second division, the Regionalliga S√ºdwest In his three seasons there he kept the club between ranks four and six. His first Bundesliga engagement with 1. FC Kaiserslautern followed 1967‚Äì68. There he was successor of the Hungarian Gyula L√≥r√°nt. He was terminated prematurely in early March 1968 after 24 matchdays when the club was just one point above a relegation rank. The last win then dated back to matchday eight. He was succeeded by Egon Piechaczek who in turn was replaced by Dietrich Weise before the end of the following season. Weise was hired by Knefler as his assistant, coming from the amateur side Neckarsulmer Sport- Union. Amongst his players in Kaiserslautern were the later coaches Uwe Klimaschefski and Otto Rehhagel. From 1968 to 1970 he coached in the second division Regionalliga West Fortuna D√ºsseldorf. There he was succeeded by Heinz Lucas, who took the side in 1971 into the Bundesliga. In 1970, he succeeded at Eintracht Braunschweig the retiring Helmuth Johannsen, who led the provincial side to the German championship of 1967. In his first year, he took the Eintracht to a surprise fourth place in the Bundesliga. The year thereafter the club finished 12th. During his time in Braunschweig he was targeted by a phone call of the president of the Bundesliga club Rot-Wei√ü Oberhausen, Peter Maa√üen who offered a bribe for a win against Braunschweig. Knefler rejected: \\"If you want to win, you better play well.\\" While Knefler refused, some of his teammates, such as Lothar Ulsa√ü, Horst Wolter, and Wolfgang Grzyb, accepted bribes and were later punished in the wake of the so-called Bundesliga scandal.Bundesliga: Schulden und Schiebung im Spiel, Der Spiegel, 44/1971, 25 October 1971. Weakened by the loss of their most important players Eintracht Braunschweig finished 1972‚Äì73 as 17th of 18 clubs and was relegated. Braunschweig retained Knefler all the same and he succeeded in immediately returning the club to the Bundesliga. Knefler thereafter was replaced with Branko Zebec and moved on to then second division club Borussia Dortmund finishing the season sixth. 1975‚Äì76 he was replaced after matchday 21 with Horst Buhtz. The club was then in fourth position and finished the season in second place, gaining promotion after two wins in a decider against 1. FC N√ºrnberg, the second of the southern group of the second division. Generally, he is credited that in his time with the club the team developed to a credible contestant for promotion. With a team of unfancied players he reached the semifinal of the German Cup in 1975, there only losing 1‚Äì2 away after extra time to MSV Duisburg - which lost the final 0‚Äì1 to Eintracht Frankfurt, coached by Knefler's former assistant Dietrich Weise. The team often attracted large crowds of around 40,000 spectators, more than many Bundesliga sides could expect. His time at the club which was relegated in 1972, was marred by internal jealousies, that presumably were a major factor behind his premature demise in the end of January 1976.Fussball: Wie im P√ºtt, Der Spiegel, 48/1975, 24 November 1975. Mid 1976 he was hired by MSV Duisburg and thus returned into the Bundesliga. With the Austrian playmaker Kurt Jara and the attackers Rudi Seliger and Ronald Worm and the solid defence around Bernard Dietz and Detlef Pirsig the club finished ninth. Knefler retired for medical reasons - half of his stomach had to be removedNur im Dschum, Der Spiegel, 53/1980, 29 December 1980 \\\\- but returned from matchday 10 for six matches to the coaching bench in Duisburg.

On the return from a Cup-match in Bremen on 23 September 1978 - where the Eintracht with players like J√ºrgen Grabowski, Bernd H√∂lzenbein and the Austrian Bruno Pezzey won 3‚Äì2 - Knefler sustained severe injuries in a car accident so that he had to abandon his career in December, after 16 league matches, the Eintracht then being sixth in the league.Frank Gotta: Ein Sturmhoch aus Schweden, Frankfurter Neue Presse, 14 August 2011 (per 8 October 2013) Initially Udo Klug and then Friedel Rausch led the club to a finish on the fifth spot.

While such disappearances have occurred sporadically throughout the history of apiculture, and have been known by various names (including disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic rise in reports of disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. Beekeepers in most European countries have observed a similar phenomenon since 1998, especially in Southern and Western Europe;Weakening, collapse and mortality of bee colonies; November 2008 ‚Äì Updated April 2009 anses.fr the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%. The phenomenon became more global when it affected some Asian and African countries as well. Although the US industry has been declining, worldwide, the bee population has been increasing steadily since 1975, based on honey production. China is responsible for most of the growth. The period of time with the lowest growth in worldwide honey production was between 1991 and 1999, this is clearly due to the economic collapse after the dissolution of communism in the former Soviet sphere of influence. As of 2020 the production has increased further by 50% compared to 2000, double the rate of growth in previous decades, despite CCD. In the United States, due to the varroa mite, other diseases and economic conditions, the managed hive industry has been shrinking at a steady pace since 1961, although it seems to have stabilised in recent years. In the six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million bee colonies across the world were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. In comparison, according to FAO data, the world's beehive stock rose from around 50 million in 1961 to around 83 million in 2014, averaging about 1.3% annual growth. Average annual growth has accelerated to 1.9% since 2009. Honey-producing colonies in the United States increased 4% to 2.8 million in 2018, but the year before they dropped 4%, and the year before that they increased 4%. Colony collapse disorder could cause significant economic losses because many agricultural crops worldwide depend on pollination by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the total value of global crops pollinated by honey bees was estimated at nearly US$200 billion in 2005.Spotlight: Protecting the pollinators . Fao.org. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. In the United States, shortages of bees have increased the cost to farmers renting them for pollination services by up to 20%. Several possible causes for CCD have been proposed, but no single proposal has gained widespread acceptance among the scientific community. Suggested causes include pesticides; infections with various pathogens, especially those transmitted by Varroa and Acarapis mites; malnutrition; genetic factors; immunodeficiencies; loss of habitat; changing beekeeping practices; or a combination of factors. A large amount of speculation has surrounded the contributions of the neonicotinoid family of pesticides to CCD, but many collapsing apiaries show no trace of neonicotinoids.  History  Colony collapse disorder is a syndrome defined by a specific set of symptoms which, in the past several decades, has been given many different names (among them \\"disappearing disease\\", \\"spring dwindle\\", \\"May disease\\", \\"autumn collapse\\", and \\"fall dwindle disease\\"). The cause of these symptoms has never been determined. Only very recently, upon recognition that the syndrome does not seem to be seasonally restricted, and that it may not be a \\"disease\\" in the standard sense‚Äîthat there may not be one specific causative agent or pathogenesis‚Äìwas the syndrome renamed. Limited occurrences resembling CCD were documented as early as 1869. A well-documented outbreak of colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight to the rest of the UK in 1906. These losses were later attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, Acarine (tracheal) mites, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but during the outbreak, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was unknown. Reports show similar behavior in hives in the US in 1918 and 1919. Coined \\"mystery disease\\" by some, it eventually became more widely known as \\"disappearing disease\\". Oertel, in 1965, reported that hives afflicted with disappearing disease in Louisiana had plenty of honey in the combs, although few or no bees were present, discrediting reports that attributed the disappearances to lack of food. From 1972 to 2006, dramatic reductions continued in the number of feral honey bees in the US and a significant though somewhat gradual decline in the number of colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline included cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe the sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom). Losses had remained stable since the 1990s at 17‚Äì20% per year, attributable to a variety of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. In the winter of 2004‚Äì2005, a spontaneous collapse occurred and was attributed to varroa mites (the \\"vampire mite\\" scare), though this was ultimately never confirmed. The first report classified as CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies, with surviving colonies so weakened that they might no longer be able to pollinate or produce honey. In late February 2007, some larger non-migratory beekeepers in the mid-Atlantic and Pacific Northwest regions also reported significant losses of more than 50%. Colony losses were also reported in five Canadian provinces, several European countries, and countries in South and Central America and Asia. In 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture reported that data on overall honey bee losses for 2010 indicated an estimated 34% loss, which is statistically similar to losses reported in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Fewer colony losses occurred in the US over the winter of 2013‚Äì2014 than in recent years. Total losses of managed honey bee colonies from all causes were 23.2% nationwide, a marked improvement over the 30.5% loss reported for the winter of 2012‚Äì2013 and the eight-year average loss of 29.6%. After bee populations dropped 23% in the winter of 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Agriculture formed a task force to address the issue. In the six years leading up to 2013, more than 10 million beehives were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. However, according to Syngenta and the FAO, the total number of beehives worldwide continues to grow. An insecticide produced by Syngenta was banned by the European Commission in 2013 for use in crops pollinated by bees.European Commission. Bees & Pesticides: Commission to proceed with plan to better protect bees; Press Release, 29 April 2013. Syngenta together with Bayer is challenging this ban in court. Since 2014, Congress has substantially subsidized the pollinator industry through the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2014 Farm Bill has allowed for up to $20 million worth of subsidies every fiscal year to be put toward conservation of honeybees, livestock, and farm-raised fish that suffer losses due to disease, weather events, or adverse conditions. In 2017, Congress implemented additional funding to protect bees from agricultural pesticide spray and dust applications while they are under contract to provide pollination services. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, increased the monetary cap for the annual financial aid for emergency assistance from $20 million to $34 million. Signs and symptoms Visit to a bee colony in West Virginia CCD is not the same as colony decline that can be caused by various issues such as queen health, varroa mite infestation, nutrition, and various diseases. In collapsed colonies, CCD is suspected when it is observed that few adult bees are physically present in the colony. Unlike with other acute causes of die-off such as pesticide exposure, few if any dead bees are found in or near the hive, as if the hive had simply been abandoned. A colony that has collapsed from CCD is generally characterized by all of these conditions occurring simultaneously: * Presence of capped brood in abandoned colonies. Bees normally do not abandon a hive until the capped brood have all hatched. * Presence of food stores, both honey and bee pollen: ** that other bees do not rob immediately ** with significantly delayed attacks by hive pests such as wax moths and small hive beetles * Presence of the queen bee. If the queen is not present, the hive likely died because it was queenless, which is not considered CCD. Precursor symptoms that may arise before the final colony collapse include: * Inability to maintain current brood due to low workforce * Colony includes mostly young adult bees * Bees are reluctant to consume provided feed, such as sugar syrup and protein supplement. Genetic and physio-pathological predictions Before any symptomatic manifestation of colony collapse disorder, various physio- pathological traits may serve as biomarkers for colony health as well as predict CCD status. Bees of collapsing colonies tend to have a soft fecal matter, half-filled rectums, rectal enteroliths (rectal stones), and Malpighian tubule iridescence. The defective rectum indicates nutritional disruption or water imbalance, whereas rectal enteroliths suggest a malfunction of excretory physiology which might further lead to constipation and poor osmoregulation in CCD bees. These traits express at various degrees across four bee age groups (newly emerged bees, nurse bees, non-pollen foragers, and pollen foragers) and were confirmed not to be associated with age. In addition, there are genetic indications in the gut that suggest the susceptibility of honey bees to CCD. Sixty-five different RNA transcripts have been determined as potential signs for CCD status. Genetic expression of these transcripts were either upregulated or downregulated depending on genes when comparing them to healthy bees. The abundance of unusual ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragments containing poly(A)-rich 3‚Ä≤ tails was detected via microarray analysis and qPCR in the guts of CCD bees. This evidence suggests that these poly(A)-rRNA sequences play the role of degradation intermediates to help in protein folding and enzymatic activity of rRNA. Furthermore, the presence of deformed wing virus and Israeli acute paralysis virus as well as the expression of poly(A)-rRNA are genetic indications for the appearance of CCD. Scope and distribution =United States= 350px The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) reported 2.44 million honey-producing hives were in the United States in February 2008, down from 4.5 million in 1980, and 5.9 million in 1947, though these numbers underestimate the total number of managed hives, as they exclude several thousand hives managed for pollination contracts only, and also do not include hives managed by beekeepers owning fewer than 5 hives. This under-representation may be offset by the practice of counting some hives more than once; hives that are moved to different states to produce honey are counted in each state's total and summed in total counts. In 2007 in the US, at least 24 different states had reported at least one case of CCD. In a 2007 survey of 384 responding beekeepers from 13 states, 23.8% met the specified criterion for CCD (that 50% or more of their dead colonies were found without bees and / or with very few dead bees in the hive or apiary). In 2006‚Äì2007, CCD-suffering operations had a total loss of 45% compared to the total loss of 25% of all colonies experienced by non-CCD suffering beekeepers. A 2007‚Äì2008 survey of over 19% of all US colonies revealed a total loss of 35.8%. Operations that pollinated almonds lost, on average, the same number of colonies as those that did not. The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations were more likely to have this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD. Between 2007‚Äì2013 after CCD was described in the US, annual winter colony losses doubled from 15% pre-CCD to 30%. Such loss rates fell to 24% from 2014 to 2017 and CCD symptoms were not as commonly associated with hive losses. While CCD has increased hive losses, honey bee colony numbers in the US have remained stable or grown since the identification of CCD. Throughout the year in 2017, NASS reported total US hives ranged between 2.63 and 2.99 million throughout the year for operations with more than five colonies, and 35‚Äì43 thousand hives for those with fewer than 5 colonies. In the same year, operations with more than 5 colonies lost 77.8 thousand hives (2.6‚Äì3.0%) with CCD symptoms and those with fewer than 5 colonies lost 6 thousand hives (14‚Äì17%) with CCD symptoms. = Europe = An abandoned beehive in Bromley in London According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the British Beekeepers Association reported the bee population in the United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40‚Äì50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no harmonisation was used in the way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides. In 2009, Tim Lovett, president of the British Beekeepers' Association, said: \\"Anecdotally, it is hugely variable. There are reports of some beekeepers losing almost a third of their hives and others losing none.\\" John Chapple, chairman of the London Beekeepers' Association, put losses among his 150 members at between a fifth and a quarter. \\"There are still a lot of mysterious disappearances; we are no nearer to knowing what is causing them.\\" The government's National Bee Unit continued to deny the existence of CCD in Britain; it attributes the heavy losses to the varroa mite and rainy summers that stop bees foraging for food. In 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers' Association stated, \\"We still do not believe CCD (which is now better defined) is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however we are continuing to experience colony losses, many if not most of which can be explained.\\" He feels recent studies suggest \\"further evidence to the evolving picture that there are complex interactions taking place between a number of factors, pathogens, environmental, beekeeping practices and other stressors, which are causing honey bee losses described as CCD in the US\\". Beekeepers in Scotland also reported losses from 2007 to 2009. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009‚Äì2010 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread because of a lack of bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented honey bees from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores. In Germany, where some of the first reports of CCD in Europe appeared, and where, according to the German national association of beekeepers, 40% of the honey bee colonies died, there was no scientific confirmation; in early May 2007, the German media reported no confirmed CCD cases seemed to have occurred in Germany. In 2012, a report was published stating the first case of CCD, according to more stringent definitions, occurring outside of the US was in Switzerland. At the end of May 2012, the Swiss government reported about half of the bee population had not survived the winter. The main cause of the decline was thought to be the parasite Varroa destructor. = Asia = In China, a three-year survey from 2010 to 2013 (using COLOSS questionnaires) showed colony losses of 10.1% on average. Comb renewal and queen problems were identified as significant risk factors.  Possible causes  The mechanisms of CCD are still unknown, but many causes are currently being considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, beekeeping practices (such as the use of antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific consensus is that no single factor is causing CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically. In 2006, the Colony Collapse Disorder Working Group, based primarily at Pennsylvania State University, was established. Their preliminary report pointed out some patterns, but drew no strong conclusions. A survey of beekeepers early in 2007 indicated most hobbyist beekeepers believed that starvation was the leading cause of death in their colonies, while commercial beekeepers overwhelmingly believed invertebrate pests (Varroa mites, honey bee tracheal mites, and/or small hive beetles) were the leading cause of colony mortality. A scholarly review in June 2007 similarly addressed numerous theories and possible contributing factor, but left the issue unresolved. In July 2007, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) released a CCD Action Plan, which outlined a strategy for addressing CCD consisting of four main components: survey and data collection; analysis of samples; hypothesis-driven research; mitigation and preventive action. The first annual report of the U.S. Colony Collapse Disorder Steering Committee was published in 2009. It suggested CCD may be caused by the interaction of many agents in combination. The same year, the CCD Working Group published a comprehensive descriptive study that concluded: \\"Of the 61 variables quantified (including adult bee physiology, pathogen loads, and pesticide levels), no single factor was found with enough consistency to suggest one causal agent. Bees in CCD colonies had higher pathogen loads and were co-infected with more pathogens than control populations, suggesting either greater pathogen exposure or reduced defenses in CCD bees.\\" The second annual Steering Committee report was released in November 2010. The group reported that although many associations‚Äîincluding pesticides, parasites, and pathogens‚Äîhad been identified throughout the course of research, \\"it is becoming increasingly clear that no single factor alone is responsible for [CCD]\\". Their findings indicated an absence of damaging levels of the parasite Nosema or parasitic Varroa mites at the time of collapse. They did find an association of sublethal effects of some pesticides with CCD, including two common miticides in particular, coumaphos and fluvalinate, which are pesticides registered for use by beekeepers to control varroa mites. Studies also identified sublethal effects of neonicotinoids and fungicides, pesticides that may impair the bees' immune systems and may leave them more susceptible to bee viruses.Dennis vanEngelsdorp, Why are the bees dying?, The Real News Network, 2013.08.04Dennis vanEngelsdorp, Stop Selling Bee-Harming Plants, The Real News Network, 2014.02.14 A 2015 review examined 170 studies on colony collapse disorder and stressors for bees, including pathogens, agrochemicals, declining biodiversity, climate change and more. The review concluded that \\"a strong argument can be made that it is the interaction among parasites, pesticides, and diet that lies at the heart of current bee health problems.\\" Furthermore: > \\"Bees of all species are likely to encounter multiple stressors during their > lives, and each is likely to reduce the ability of bees to cope with the > others.

According to the USDA pesticides may be contributing to CCD. Scientists have long been concerned that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Maryann Frazier said \\"pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD. We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses and pesticides.\\" A 2010 survey reported 98 pesticides and metabolites detected in aggregate concentrations up to 214 ppm in bee pollen; this figure represents over half of the individual pesticide incidences ever reported for apiaries. It was suggested that \\"while exposure to many of these neurotoxicants elicits acute and sublethal reductions in honey bee fitness, the effects of these materials in combinations and their direct association with CCD or declining bee health remains to be determined.\\" Evaluating pesticide contributions to CCD is particularly difficult for several reasons. First, the variety of pesticides in use in the different areas reporting CCD makes it difficult to test for all possible pesticides simultaneously. Second, many commercial beekeeping operations are mobile, transporting hives over large geographic distances over the course of a season, potentially exposing the colonies to different pesticides at each location. Third, the bees themselves place pollen and honey into long-term storage, effectively meaning a delay may occur from days to months before contaminated provisions are fed to the colony, negating any attempts to associate the appearance of symptoms with the actual time when exposure to pesticides occurred. In 2010 a sequencing of the honey bee genome provided a possible explanation for the sensitivity of bees to pesticides. Its genome is deficient in the number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione-S-transferases, and carboxylesterases. Neonicotinoids Of special interest is the class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known to work their way through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. A 2013 literature review concluded neonicotinoids in the amounts typically used harm bees and alternatives are urgently needed. At the same time, other sources suggest the evidence is not conclusive, and that clarity regarding the facts is hampered by the role played by various issue advocates and lobby groups. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Imidacloprid map of use, US, 2012 (estimated) To date, most of the evaluation of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied on the use of surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation. In Europe, the interaction of the phenomenon of \\"dying bees\\" with imidacloprid has been discussed for quite some time. A study from the \\"Comit√© Scientifique et Technique (CST)\\" was at the center of discussion, and led to a partial ban of imidacloprid in France. The imidacloprid pesticide Gaucho was banned in 1999 by the French Minister of Agriculture Jean Glavany, primarily due to concern over potential effects on honey bees. Subsequently, when fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide and in Europe mainly labeled \\"Regent\\", was used as a replacement, it was also found to be toxic to bees, and banned partially in France in 2004. Five other insecticides based on fipronil were also accused of killing bees. However, the scientific committees of the European Union are still of the opinion \\"that the available monitoring studies were mainly performed in France and EU-member- states should consider the relevance of these studies for the circumstances in their country.\\" While French beekeepers succeeded in banning neonicotinoids, the Clinton administration permitted pesticides that were previously banned,Re-Regulation of Pesticides. PBS. . including imidacloprid. In 2004, the Bush administration reduced regulations further and pesticide applications increased. In 2005 a team of scientists found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause honey bee colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired. Neonicotinoids may interfere with bees' natural homing abilities, causing them to become disoriented and preventing them from finding their way back to the hive. Also, in 2012, researchers in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid release large amounts of the pesticide into the air, and theorised that this might be the cause of CCD. Commonly used pesticides, such as the imidacloprid, reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels. Lu et al (2012) reported they were able to replicate CCD with imidacloprid. Another neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, causes navigational homing failure of foraging bees, with high mortality. A 2012 in situ study provided strong evidence that exposure to sublethal levels of imidacloprid in high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) used to feed honey bees when forage is not available causes bees to exhibit symptoms consistent to CCD 23 weeks after imidacloprid dosing. The researchers suggested, \\"the observed delayed mortality in honey bees caused by imidacloprid in HFCS is a novel and plausible mechanism for CCD, and should be validated in future studies.\\" Two 2013 studies suggested that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, possibly resulting in reduced ability to return to the hive. In another 2013 study scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the neonicotinoid pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses. Growth in the use of neonicotinoid pesticides has roughly tracked rising bee deaths. In 2015, an 11-year British study showed a definitive relationship between increasing agricultural use of neonicotinoid and escalating honey bee colony losses at a landscape level. This is the first field study to establish a link between neonicotinoids and CCD. Bee collecting pollen A meta-analysis study published in February 2016 strongly suggests a pattern linking imidacloprid to sublethal effects on honey bees, stating: \\"trace dietary imidacloprid at field-realistic levels in nectar will have no lethal effects, but will reduce expected performance in honey bees by between 6 and 20%. Statistical power analysis showed that published field trials that have reported no effects on honey bees from neonicotinoids were incapable of detecting these predicted sublethal effects with conventionally accepted levels of certainty.\\" In 2012 several studies were published showing that neonicotinoids had previously undetected routes of exposure affecting bees including through dust, pollen, and nectar and that subnanogram toxicity resulted in failure to return to the hive without immediate lethality, one primary symptom of CCD. Research also showed environmental persistence in agricultural irrigation channels and soil. These reports prompted a formal peer review by the European Food Safety Authority, which stated in January 2013 that some neonicotinoids pose an unacceptably high risk to bees, and identified several data gaps not previously considered. Their review concluded, \\"A high acute risk to honey bees was identified from exposure via dust drift for the seed treatment uses in maize, oilseed rape and cereals. A high acute risk was also identified from exposure via residues in nectar and/or pollen.\\" Dave Goulson, an author of one of the studies that prompted the EFSA review, has suggested that industry science pertaining to neonicotinoids may have been deliberately deceptive, and the UK Parliament has asked manufacturer Bayer Cropscience to explain discrepancies in evidence they have submitted to an investigation.Damian Carrington (16 January 2013) \\"Insecticide 'unacceptable' danger to bees, report finds\\" The Guardian Early in 2013 the European Food Safety Authority issued a declaration that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honey bees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led one of the key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling, said the decision \\"begs the question of what was going on when these chemicals were first approved.\\" The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was \\"ready to work with\\" the EC and member states. In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid insecticides. The ban will restrict the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam for use on crops that are attractive to bees. Eight nations voted against the motion, including the British government, which argued that the science was incomplete. The ban can be seen as an application of the \\"precautionary principle\\", established at the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment and Development, which advocates that \\"lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.\\" Pollination In 2013 beekeepers and environmentalists jointly filed a lawsuit blaming the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for continuing to allow the use of neonicotinoids in the United States. The suit specifically asked for suspension of clothianidin and thiamethoxam. The EPA responded to the suit by pointing to research which found the Varroa mite responsible for the decline in bees and showed that the role of neonicotinoids in CCD had been overstated. The Save America's Pollinators Act (H.R. 2692) was introduced in Congress in 2013, and reintroduced in 2015. The proposed act asked that neonicotinoids be suspended until a full review of their impacts had occurred.https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1284 Saving America's Pollinators Act (H.R. 1284) In 2010 fipronil was blamed for the spread of CCD among bees, in a study by the Minutes-Association for Technical Coordination Fund in France, which found that even at very low nonlethal doses, this pesticide still impairs the ability to locate the hive, resulting in large numbers of foragers lost with every pollen-finding expedition, though no mention was made regarding any of the other symptoms of CCD; other studies, however, have shown no acute effect of fipronil on honey bees. Fipronil is designed to eliminate insects similar to bees, such as yellowjackets (Vespula germanica) and many other colonial pests by a process of 'toxic baiting', whereby one insect returning to the hive spreads the pesticide among the brood. Other 2008 research by scientists from Pennsylvania State University found high levels of the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals have been used to try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. Researchers from Washington State University, under entomologist Steve Sheppard in 2009, confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between it and significantly reduced bee longevity. In 2012 researchers announced findings that sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered honey bees significantly more susceptible to infection by the fungus Nosema, thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD. In 2013 scientists from the University of Maryland and the US Department of Agriculture found that a combination of pesticides had been contaminating the pollen bees use to feed their hives. When researchers collected pollen from hives on the east coast, they discovered that it was contaminated with on average by nine different fungicides and pesticides, although scientists found a blend of 21 different agricultural chemicals in one sample of pollen. Eight ag chemicals were identified to be associated with increased risk of infection by Nosema ceranae. The WSU work also focused on the impact of the microsporidian pathogen Nosema ceranae, the build-up of which was high in the majority of the bees tested, even after large doses of the antibiotic fumagillin. Honeycomb of honey bees with eggs and larvae. The walls of the cells have been removed. The larvae (drones) are about 3 or 4 days old. Coumaphos, an organophosphate, is lipophilic, and so accumulates in wax. Increased levels of compound in wax have been shown to decrease survivorship of developing queens. A large 2010 survey of healthy and CCD-affected colonies also revealed elevated levels of pesticides in wax and pollen, but the amounts of pesticides were similar in both failing and healthy hives. They also confirmed suspected links between CCD and poor colony health, inadequate diet, and long-distance transportation. Studies continue to show very high levels of pathogens in CCD-affected samples and lower pathogen levels in unaffected samples, consistent with the empirical observation that healthy honey bee colonies normally fend off pathogens. These observations have led to the hypothesis that bee declines are resulting from immune suppression. = Pathogens and immunodeficiency theories = Early researchers commented that the pathway of propagation functions in the manner of a contagious disease; however, some sentiment existed that the disorder may involve an immunosuppressive mechanism, potentially linked to \\"stress\\" leading to a weakened immune system. Specifically, according to research done in 2007 at the Pennsylvania State University: \\"The magnitude of detected infectious agents in the adult bees suggests some type of immunosuppression\\". These researchers initially suggested a connection between Varroa destructor mite infestation and CCD, suggesting that a combination of these bee mites, deformed wing virus (which the mites transmit) and bacteria work together to suppress immunity and may be one cause of CCD. Parasites, such as varroa mites (Varroa destructor), honey bee tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi), fungal, bacterial and viral diseases, and kleptoparasites such as small hive beetles (Aethina tumida), are all problems that have been introduced within the last 20 years in the continental U.S., and are faced by beekeepers. When a colony is dying, for whatever cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions for their own use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, in typical CCD cases, provisions of dying colonies are not robbed, suggesting that toxins do not spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD- exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries. Varroa destructor on a honey bee host  Varroa mites  According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa destructor remains the world's most destructive honey bee killer, due in part to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have both been implicated in CCD.Welsh, Jennifer (7 June 2012) Mites and Virus Team Up to Wipe Out Beehives Live Science, Retrieved 11 June 2012 Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007‚Äì08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites. Varroa destructor is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on honey bees by consuming their hemolymph. Varroa mites parasitize all types of honey bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) depending on their life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads to an increase in mite fecundity (number of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on all types of honey bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter. In 2020 a group of scientists announced that they were in the early stages of field testing a bacterium with specifically genetically modified plasmids that both suppressed infection with deformed wing virus but also effectively reduced Varroa mite survival.  Israeli acute paralysis virus  In 2004, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), was discovered in Israel and at one time it was considered the cause of CCD. It was named after the place it was first identified; its place of origin is unknown. In September 2007, results of a large-scale statistical RNA sequencing study of afflicted and unafflicted colonies were reported. RNA from all organisms in a colony was sequenced and compared with sequence databases to detect the presence of pathogens. All colonies were found to be infected with numerous pathogens, but only the IAPV virus showed a significant association with CCD: the virus was found in 25 of the 30 tested CCD colonies, and only in one of the 21 tested non-CCD colonies. Research in 2009 has found that an indicator for an impaired protein production is common among all bees affected by CCD, a pattern consistent with IAPV infection. It is conjectured that Dicistroviridae, like the IAPV, cause degradation of the ribosomes, which are responsible for protein production of cells, and that this reduced ribosomal function weakens the bees, making them more vulnerable to factors that might not otherwise be lethal.Genomic Study Yields Plausible Cause Of Colony Collapse Disorder at Science Daily on 2009-8-25  Nosema  Some have suggested the syndrome may be an inability by beekeepers to correctly identify known diseases such as European foulbrood or the microsporidian fungus Nosema apis. The testing and diagnosis of samples from affected colonies (already performed) makes this highly unlikely, as the symptoms are fairly well known and differ from what is classified as CCD. A high rate of Nosema infection was reported in samples of bees from Pennsylvania, but this pattern was not reported from samples elsewhere. When healthy bees are fed pollen filled with fungicides, insecticides and other agriculture chemicals, they are more likely to be infected by Nosema ceranae, a parasitic microsporidian fungus associated with widespread death of honey bees. Hives of western honey bees infected with Nosema ceranae are wiped out within eight days indicating that CCD may be caused by N. ceranae. A research team claim to have ruled out many other potential causes,Asian Parasite Killing Western Bees ‚Äì Scientist, Planet Ark, SPAIN: 19 July 2007Maria Mancilla, Les abeilles sont-elles en train de dispara√Ætre?, Rue 89, 29 August 2007 . however, a 2009 survey of US CCD- affected bee populations found only about half of the colonies sampled, both in CCD and control populations, were infected with N. ceranae. hyperparasitic microsporidian, Nosema podocotyloidis, a parasite of a digenean, Podocotyloides magnatestis, which is itself a parasite of the fish Parapristipoma octolineatum (Teleostei) The primary antifungal agent used against Nosema is fumagillin, which has been used in a German research project to reduce the microsporidian's impact, and is mentioned as a possible remedy by the CCDWG. Higes also claims to have successfully cured colonies with fumagillin.Cure For Honey Bee Colony Collapse? Science Daily article A review of these results described these results as promising, but cautioned \\"N. ceranae may not be to blame for all cases of colony collapse\\". Various areas in Europe have reported this fungus, but no direct link to CCD has yet been established. In 2007, N. ceranae was reported in a few hives in California. The researcher did not, however, believe this was conclusive evidence of a link to CCD; \\"We don't want to give anybody the impression that this thing has been solved\\". A USDA bee scientist has similarly stated, \\"while the parasite Nosema ceranae may be a factor, it cannot be the sole cause. The fungus has been seen before, sometimes in colonies that were healthy\\". N. ceranae has been detected in honey bees from several states using PCR of the 16S gene.Chapon, L., M.D. Ellis, and A.L. Szalanski. 2009. Nosema and tracheal mites in the north central region ‚Äì 2008 survey. Proceedings of the American Bee Research Conference. American Bee Journal 149: 585‚Äì586. In New York, N. ceranae was detected in 49 counties, and of the 1,200 honey bee samples collected, 528 (44%) were positive for Nosema, from which, PCR analysis of 371 spore positive samples revealed 96% were N. ceranae, 3% had both N. ceranae and N. apis, and 1% had N. apis only.Szalanski, A.L., J. Whitaker, and P. Cappy. 2010. Molecular diagnostics of Nosema ceranae and N. apis from honey bees in New York. Proceedings of the American Bee Research Conference. American Bee Journal 150: 508 = Viral and fungal combination = A University of Montana and Montana State University team of scientists headed by Jerry Bromenshenk and working with the US Army's Edgewood Chemical Biological Center published a paper in October 2010 saying that a new DNA virus, invertebrate iridescent virus type 6 (IIV-6), and the fungus Nosema ceranae were found in every killed colony the group studied. In their study, they found neither agent alone seemed deadly, but a combination of the virus and N. ceranae was always 100% fatal. Information about the study was released to the public in a front-page article in The New York Times. A few days later, an article was published in Fortune Magazine with the title, \\"What a scientist didn't tell the New York Times about his study on bee deaths\\". Professor of entomology at Penn State University James Frazier, who was researching the sublethal impact of pesticides on bees, said that while Bromenshenk's study generated some useful data, Bromenshenk has a conflict of interest as CEO of a company developing scanners to diagnose bee diseases. A few months later, the methods used to interpret the mass spectrometry data in the Bromenshenk study were called into question, raising doubts as to whether IIV-6 was ever correctly identified in any of the samples examined. = Fungicides = In 2013, researchers collected pollen from hives and fed it to healthy bees. The pollen had an average of nine different pesticides and fungicides. Further, the researchers discovered that bees that ate pollen with fungicides were three times more likely to be infected by parasites. Their study shows that fungicides, thought harmless to bees, may actually play a significant role in CCD. Their research also showed that spraying practices may need to be reviewed because the bees sampled by the authors foraged not from crops, but almost exclusively from weeds and wildflowers, suggesting that bees are more widely exposed to pesticides than thought. Dennis vanEngelsdorp, an entomologist at the University of Maryland, has been quoted as saying \\"Fungicides, which we didn't expect to harm insects, seem to have a sub-lethal effect on bee health\\". He went on further to state this is important because fungicides are not heavily regulated. = Antibiotics and miticides = Most beekeepers affected by CCD report that they use antibiotics and miticides in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, it is possible that not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides for an extended period of time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A study at the University of Texas in Austin found that commonly used antibiotics found in beekeeping to prevent disease lower the gut microbial levels in honeybees, making them more susceptible to disease. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Researchers state that although the antibiotics are necessary, beekeepers should exercise caution when determining amount and length of use. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.  Fluvalinate/coumaphos  In 2008 high levels of the pesticides fluvalinate and coumaphos were found in samples of wax from hives, as well as lower levels of 70 other pesticides. These chemicals have been used to try to eradicate varroa mites, a bee pest that itself has been thought to be a cause of CCD. A 2009 study confirmed high levels of pesticide residue in hive wax and found an association between the pesticide and reduced bee longevity. Nosema ceranae, was found in high concentrations in the majority of the bees tested, even after administering large doses of the antibiotic fumagillin. Maryann Frazier commented, \\"Pesticides alone have not shown they are the cause of CCD. We believe that it is a combination of a variety of factors, possibly including mites, viruses and pesticides.\\" =Climate change= Environmental changes may have an effect on honey bee development, but the precise impact of potential environmental changes on honey bees as a result of climate change is unknown. Moving spring bees from South Carolina to Maine for blueberry pollination = Bee rentals and migratory beekeeping = Since U.S. beekeeper Nephi Miller first began moving his hives to different areas of the country for the winter of 1908, migratory beekeeping has become widespread in America. Bee rental for pollination is a crucial element of U.S. agriculture, which could not produce anywhere near its current levels with native pollinators alone., specifically, \\"Close to 100 crop species in the U.S. rely to some degree on pollination services provided by this one species‚Äîcollectively, these crops make up approximately 1/3 of the U.S. diet [...] Although economists differ in calculating the exact dollar value of honey bee pollination to American agriculture, virtually all estimates are in the range of billions of dollars\\". U.S. beekeepers collectively earn much more from renting their bees out for pollination than they do from honey production. Researchers are concerned that trucking colonies around the country to pollinate crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread viruses and mites among colonies. Additionally, such continuous movement and re-settlement is considered by some a strain and disruption for the entire hive, possibly rendering it less resistant to all sorts of systemic disorder. = Selective commercial breeding and lost genetic diversity in industrial apiculture = Most of the focus on CCD has been toward environmental factors. CCD is a condition recognised for greatest impact in regions of 'industrial' or agricultural use of commercially bred bee colonies. Natural breeding and colony reproduction of wild bees is a complex and highly selective process, leading to a diverse genetic makeup in large within-colony populations of bees, which might not be reproduced in commercially bred colonies. = Malnutrition = In 2007, one of the patterns reported by the CCD Study Group at Pennsylvania State was that all producers in a preliminary survey noted a period of \\"extraordinary stress\\" affecting the colonies in question prior to their die-off, most commonly involving poor nutrition and/or drought. This was the only factor that all of the cases of CCD had in common in the report; accordingly, there appeared to be at least some significant possibility that the phenomenon was correlated to nutritional stress that may not manifest in healthy, well-nourished colonies. This was similar to the findings of another independent survey done in 2007 in which small-scale beekeeping operations (up to 500 colonies) in several states reported their belief that malnutrition and/or weak colonies was the factor responsible for their bees dying in over 50% of the cases, whether the losses were believed to be due to CCD or not. Some researchers have attributed the syndrome to the practice of feeding high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) to supplement winter stores. The variability of HFCS may be relevant to the apparent inconsistencies of results. One European writer has suggested a possible connection with HFCS produced from genetically modified corn. However, at least one researcher states that if this were the sole factor involved, this should also lead to the exclusive appearance of CCD in wintering colonies being fed HFCS, but many reports of CCD occur in other contexts with beekeepers who do not use HFCS. Other researchers state that colony collapse disorder is mainly a problem of feeding the bees a monoculture diet when they should receive food from a variety of sources/plants. In winter, these bees are given a single food source such as corn syrup (high- fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples). The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. Honey bees are only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for honey bees to be introduced to exclusively, including sweet clover and mustard. Pupae of honeybee drones in opened cells at both sides of a honeycomb. The drones at the right side are some days older and more developed. A study published in 2010 found that bees that were fed pollen from a variety of different plant species showed signs of having a healthier immune system than those eating pollen from a single species. Bees fed pollen from five species had higher levels of glucose oxidase than bees fed pollen from one species, even if the pollen had a higher protein content. The authors hypothesised that CCD may be linked to a loss of plant diversity.Bee decline linked to falling biodiversity Richard Black, BBC News, 20 January 2010 Researches found a proper diet that does lead to a healthy honey bee population. \\"The authors recommended a diet containing 1000 ppm potassium, 500 ppm calcium,300 ppm magnesium and 50 ppm each of sodium, zinc, manganese, iron and copper.\\" A 2014 studies found that bees fed high- fructose corn syrup or sugar shows downregulation in several genes related to protein metabolism and oxidation reduction as compared to those fed the similarly low-protein honey. A 2013 study found that p-Coumaric acid, which is normally present in honey, assists bees in detoxifying certain pesticides. Its absence in artificial nutrients fed to bees may therefore contribute to CCD. = Electromagnetic radiation = Despite considerable discussion on the Internet and in the lay media, there have been almost no careful studies, published in peer reviewed scientific literature, on effects of electromagnetic field exposure on honeybees. One of the few peer-reviewed studies was published in 1981 and found that even at microwave radiation powers far higher than used in communication, that bees were not significantly affected. A study on the non-thermal effects of radio frequency (RF) on honey bees (Apis mellifera carnica) reported there were no changes in behavior due to RF exposure from DECT cordless phone base stations operating at 1,880‚Äì1,900 MHz. A later study established that close-range electromagnetic field (EMF) may reduce the ability of bees to return to their hive. In the course of their study, one half of their colonies broke down, including some control hives that did not have embedded DECT base stations. In April 2007, news of this study appeared in various media outlets, beginning with an article in The Independent, which stated that the subject of the study included mobile phones and had related them to CCD. Although cellular phones were implicated at the time by other media reports, they were not covered in the quoted study. The researchers involved have since stated that their research did not include findings on cell phones, nor their relationship to CCD, and indicated that the Independent article had misinterpreted their results and created \\"a horror story\\". A review of 919 peer-reviewed scientific studies investigating the effects of EMF on wildlife, humans, and plants included 7 studies involving honey bees; 6 of which reported negative effects from exposure to EMF radiation, but none demonstrated any specific link to CCD. A 2004 exploratory study was conducted on the non-thermal effects of electromagnetic exposure and learning. The investigators did not find any change in behavior due to RF exposure from the DECT base station operating at 1880‚Äì1900 MHz. Honeybees can detect weak static, or low-frequency magnetic fields, which they use as one of several cues in navigation. However, no mechanism has been established by which weak radio frequency energy can affect the behavior of insects, apart from minor heating effects. = Genetically modified crops = GM crops are not considered to be a cause. In 2008 a meta-analysis of 25 independent studies assessing effects of Bt Cry proteins on honeybee survival (mortality) showed that Bt proteins used in commercialized GE crops to control lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not negatively impact the survival of honeybee larvae or adults. Additionally, larvae consume only a small percent of their protein from pollen, and there is also a lack of geographic correlation between GM crop locations and regions where CCD occurs.  Management  Beekeeper managing bees, the Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium (MAAREC) offered the following tentative recommendations for beekeepers noticing the symptoms of CCD: # Do not combine collapsing colonies with strong colonies. # When a collapsed colony is found, store the equipment where you can use preventive measures to ensure that bees will not have access to it. # If you feed your bees sugar syrup, use Fumagillin. # If you are experiencing colony collapse and see a secondary infection, such as European Foulbrood, treat the colonies with oxytetracycline, not tylosin. Another proposed remedy for farmers of pollinated crops is simply to switch from using beekeepers to the use of native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended). A British beekeeper successfully developed a strain of bees that are resistant to varroa mites.Briton sends bee world abuzz with cure for killer bug. Dailyexpress.co.uk (25 August 2010).

Russian honey bees also resist infestations of varroa mites but are still susceptible to other factors associated with colony collapse disorder, and have detrimental traits that limit their relevance in commercial apiculture. In the United Kingdom, a national bee database was set up in March 2009 to monitor colony collapse as a result of a 15% reduction in the bee population that had taken place over the previous two years. In particular, the register, funded by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and administered by the National Bee Unit, will be used to monitor health trends and help establish whether the honey industry is under threat from supposed colony collapse disorder. Britain's 20,000 beekeepers have been invited to participate. In October 2010, David Aston of the British Beekeepers' Association stated, \\"We still do not believe CCD is a cause of colony losses in the UK, however we are continuing to experience colony losses, many if not most of which can be explained. The approach being taken in UK beekeeping is to raise the profile of integrated bee health management, in other words identifying and trying to eliminate factors that reduce the health status of a colony. This incorporates increasing the skill level of beekeepers through training and education, raising the profile of habitat destruction and its effect of forage (nectar and pollen) availability, and of course research on the incidence and distribution of diseases and conditions in the UK together with more applied research and development on providing solutions.\\"  Economic and ecological impact  Honey bees are not native to the Americas, therefore their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural and ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations‚Äîwhere the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology). The phenomenon is particularly important for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. California almond production increased from 370 million pounds in 1995 to a record 2,500 million pounds in 2019, with an increase of over 30% in the last decade alone. Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services. They are responsible for pollination of approximately one third of the United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in honey bees to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when honey bees are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area). However, even though on a per-individual basis, many other species are actually more efficient at pollinating, on the 30% of crop types where honey bees are used, most native pollinators cannot be mass-utilized as easily or as effectively as honey bees‚Äîin many instances they will not visit the plants at all. Beehives can be moved from crop to crop as needed, and the bees will visit many plants in large numbers, compensating via saturation pollination for what they lack in efficiency. The commercial viability of these crops is therefore strongly tied to the beekeeping industry. In China, hand pollination of apple orchards is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly.Partap, Uma Partap and Tej. Pollination of apples in China. 2 September 2005 In regions of the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) are among the most important pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources). Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination. With that said, honeybees perform some level of pollination of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide. Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; it is estimated that seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North American economy would be lost, and this is only for one region of the world. Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for honeybee pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.

Playing career Born in Naples, Campilongo started his career with Juve Stabia, then joining Lazio in 1980 and making his Serie A debut on 4 May 1980 with the biancazzurri jersey. He successively played another Serie A season, this time with Avellino, in 1980‚Äì1981 with little success. He then went on to play for lower league teams from Serie C1, Serie C2 and Interregionale. He then returned into high level football with Casertana, being a protagonist of the rossoblu's promotion to Serie B. He then spent his later years with Venezia in Serie B, Palermo in Serie C1, and more Serie C teams from Campania and Lazio before to retire in 2000. Coaching career In 2002 Campilongo was appointed head coach of Casertana in Serie D. In 2004, he went on to become Cavese boss, leading the Campanian team from Serie C2 to a narrowly missed promotion to Serie B. In 2007, he left Cavese to join Serie C1 promotion hopefuls Foggia, only to be fired a few months later by the satanelli management. In October 2008, Serie B low-table club Avellino appointed Campilongo as new head coach; in his first weeks with the biancoverdi, Campilongo led his new club to reviving, impressive results. However, financial troubles which ultimately led to the exclusion of Avellino from professional football in the summer 2009 prevented the team from ultimately escaping relegation, and the biancoverdi completed the league season in 21st place. In July 2009 Campilongo was appointed at the helm of ambitious Tuscan outfit Empoli, a team he was part of as a player from 1981 to 1983, with the aim to guide his new club back into the top flight. On 8 January 2011, he was named new head coach of relegation-threatened Frosinone, taking over from Guido Carboni. On 7 January 2012, Campilongo was named new head coach of relegation-threatened Nocerina, taking over from Gaetano Auteri., until 23 January 2012 when he rescinds the contract by mutual agreement with the company after two defeats in as many races and the last place in the ranking. On 6 July 2012, he was named new coach of Ischia in Serie D; in January 2014 he was sacked dall'Ischia. On 2 July 2014, he signed to Rimini in Serie D but about two months later, before the season, he rescinded the contract by mutual consent. On 24 November 2014, he became coach of Casertana. In November 2015 he became coach of Taranto, but after about two months, is relieved. On 8 January 2017, he was appointed coach of Vibonese. On 17 September 2019, he returned to Cavese in Serie C. He left Cavese at the end of the 2019‚Äì20 season.

Club career Born in the village of Barco in Covilh√£, Brito started playing for local Sporting Clube, but soon attracted attention from S.L. Benfica, which signed the player in 1985. At the latter he had a difficult start, going on to serve a two-year loan at fellow Primeira Liga side Portimonense SC. Upon his return, Brito appeared mainly from the bench, barred by Swede Mats Magnusson. During the 1990‚Äì91 season his biggest moment at Benfica arrived, as he scored twice ‚Äì as a substitute ‚Äì to beat FC Porto away (2‚Äì0) and eventually clinch the national title, in a match that ended in a riot. Brito eventually left Benfica in the 1995 summer, after a ten-year link and only 23 league appearances in his last three seasons combined. After a good year at Lisbon neighbours C.F. Belenenses he moved to Spain, teaming up with a host of compatriots at UD Salamanca, including attacking partner Pauleta. In his debut campaign, already aged 32, he netted 15 goals in the second level, helping the club clinch La Liga promotion while combining with Pauleta for 34 successful strikes (the pair finished joint-first and fourth in the scoring charts). In 1997‚Äì98, Brito appeared regularly as Salamanca eventually stayed in the top flight, then moved to modest CP M√©rida in division two.

The school offers a science and technology-oriented program as well as another one focused on language.  History  Founder Hermann Harless was an influential figure in the reformation of German second education, having worked one a new concept of it alongside Hermann Lietz. The result of their efforts were so-called Landerziehungsheime f√ºr Jungen (\\"Educational Community Home for Boys\\"). Their focus was put heavily on the development of a student's entire character rather than mere knowledge transfer. Those institutions were to be located away from big cities as to minimize their influence on children. Harless joined the Neue Deutsche Schule (\\"New German School\\") of Alexander Sutherland Neill, who later became the founder of the progressive Summerhill School. After the closure of Neue Deutsche Schule Harless founded his own boarding school in 1928 in the small town of Marquartstein near the Bavarian Alps. In its first year, only 16 students enrolled in Landschulheim Marquartstein. The concept of coeducation and a boarding school that accepts both girls and boys was new at that time and had only been implemented in a handful of schools across Germany. The success of Harless's approach reflected in a growing number of students and eventually earned him a permit to hold official Abitur graduation exams by 1940. This was a big achievement at the time as students from private schools normally had to take their final exams at a nearby public school. Hermann Harless was the school's principal until the forced nationalization by the Nazis in 1943. Although now under the regime's control, coeducation and mixed-sex boarding houses remained in place at the Landschulheim. Ironically, the boarding school was closed for female students four years after the end of WWII by ministerial decree. Due to dwindling numbers of boarding school residents, the mixed-sex system was brought back in 1989.  Locations  Landschulheim Marquartstein was situated on Marquartstein Castle for 30 years since it was founded. Male students had their dorms in a nearby farmhouse called Nockerhof. The girls' boarding school was located at an estate in the village of Grabenst√§tt about 10 kilometers away, which proved difficult at times in terms of transporting students between the two locations. In 1958, the school moved its facilities to the \\"new castle\\" (Neues Schloss) which was eventually purchased in 1965. After the increase of student numbers since the boarding school's reopening for girls, new buildings for specific purposes were built like a science tract with appropriate equipment for Chemistry, Physics and Biology and a new gym. Since all the facilities are situated at the bottom of a mountain, parts of the school are built into the surrounding terrain, making them semi-subterranean. Generally, though, the school is known for its scenic location amidst the alpine foothills.  Current State  In 2019, LSH Marquartstein counts about 650 students and 60 teachers. It features extensive sports-related programs for skiing, tennis and more as well as mandatory courses in handicraft work in addition to academic education. This approach to school as a place of wholesome education and character development follows the footsteps of its founder to this day. The school continues to expand its facilities, with an additional gym set to be completed in summer of 2020.

Education Haarh graduated from college in 1948; throughout his education he had a strong interest and passion for the Tibetan Language and culture. Much of the special literature in this area was unavailable in Denmark, so he made contacts in London and had the necessary material imported. After graduating he began to study the history of religion and aimed to write a dissertation about Buddhism, which required extensive language study. Following up on his interest for Tibetan language and culture, he went to Rome where he met Giuseppe Tucci and other professors such as Raffaele Pettazzoni and Walter Simon. As a part of this stay in Rome he took courses using sources in Sanskrit, Hindi, Pali, Tibetan and Chinese. After finishing his MA degree in 1955 he was employed by Copenhagen University as a teaching assistant in Tibetan language and culture. In 1956 he was employed as a librarian at the Royal Danish Library in their Oriental Department, and in 1962 became the head of the department. During the years that followed he made many research journeys in Europe and was a guest speaker at many different universities. Career Starting in 1969 he became head of the History/Religion Department at Aarhus University. In the same year, he finished his work on his magnum opus The Yarlun dynasty. In this dissertation he put his focus on showing how the ideology of the King as a main pillar in the society is connected to the religious cosmology and used sources such as priests and other hierarchical institutions. The final result has been considered quite a contribution to the Tibetology study in general. After this he worked on several catalogues ‚Äì e.g. a comparative list of the Derge and Lhasa editions of the Kanjur and a catalogue of oriental manuscripts and xylographs owned in Denmark and was therefore considered a highly valued specialist in that area. He worked with some of his students of religion as the main contributors to a series of study materials used for colleges and A-levels and took the initiative in arranging some lectures and conferences ‚Äì these being published in the same series of study material. He was invited to give lectures and instructions when UNESCO initiated a school project offering material on foreign religions for primary school teachers. These efforts created an image of him as a very approachable and friendly man who like the joined efforts of the work and who didn‚Äôt just spend his time in his office behind a pile of books. Beginning in 1983 Haarh became a professor in the Faculty of Theology. He died on 1 December 1993, after being ill for a long time.

Later on his grand daughter, Indra Kumari was married to King Prithivi Narayan Shah of Gorkha State, who annexed Makwanpur to Gorkha in 1819. There are two castles in the fort, one is called the ‚ÄúMool Gadhi‚Äù (the main fort) and other is ‚ÄúSanno Gadhi‚Äù (the small fort). About 35 years ago, there was a palace called ‚ÄúJungey Darbar‚Äù, which had its own supernatural beauty and it was an important belonging of the ‚ÄúSen Dynasty‚Äù.

On 5 August 2010, the Lake Gilles Conservation Reserve which have been dedicated as a conservation reserve on 9 December 1994 under the state's Crown Lands Act 1929 was added to the conservation park along with another parcel of crown land. As of 2014, access permitted under the state's Mining Act 1971 and Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000 only applies to the extent of the Lake Gilles water body. In 2014, the conservation park was described by its managing authority as follows: > ...an ephemeral lake system fringed by samphire communities. The park (sic) > provides habitat for the Malleefowl, Slender-billed thornbill, Thick-billed > grasswren and migratory waders. Extensive but patchy mallee communities on > the eastern plains of the park (sic) include Western Myall and associated > chenopod shrubland. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category Ia protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.  Vandalism  In 2012 and 2013, off-trail driving, burning and cutting of native vegetation, and the abandonment of rubbish and furniture were reported to have occurred in the conservation park.

This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of GABA and therefore an increase in GABAergic neurotransmission. Indications GRIs may be used in the clinical treatment of seizures, convulsions, or epilepsy as anticonvulsants/antiepileptics, anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia (SP) also known as social anxiety disorder (SAD), and panic disorder (PD) as anxiolytics, insomnia as hypnotics, muscle tremors or spasms as muscle relaxants, and chronic pain as analgesics. They may also potentially be used as anesthetics in surgery. Effects GRIs can induce a wide range of psychological and physiological effects, including a general and subjective alteration in consciousness, dizziness, blurry vision, diplopia or double vision, nystagmus or involuntary eye movements, amblyopia or \\"lazy eye\\", tinnitus or \\"ear ringing\\", sedation, drowsiness or somnolence, narcolepsy, tiredness or weakness, fatigue or lethargy, aches and pains, headache, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal disturbances, shakiness, disorientation, diminished awareness, impaired attention, focus, and concentration, decreased drive and motivation, stuttering and slurring of speech, confusion, cognitive and memory impairment, mood lift or drop, depression, anxiolysis, disinhibition, stress reduction, euphoria or dysphoria, irritability, aggression, anger or rage, increased appetite and subsequent weight gain, ataxia or impaired coordination and balance, muscle relaxation, trembling or muscle tremors and spasms, paresthesia or \\"pins and needles\\", analgesia, respiratory depression, and dyspnea or shortness of breath, among others. However, many of these properties are dependent on whether the GRI in question is capable of crossing the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Those that do not will only produce peripheral effects. GRIs such as CI-966 have been characterized as hallucinogens with effects analogous to those of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (a constituent of Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) mushrooms) when administered at sufficient doses. =Overdose= At very high doses characterized by overdose, a number of symptoms may come to prominence, including severe cognitive deficit to the point of acute retardation, anterograde or retrograde amnesia, drooling, piloerection or \\"goose bumps\\", agitation or restlessness, flailing, thrashing, and screaming, unintentional or accidental injury, delirium, hallucinations, myoclonus, dystonia, paralysis, stupor, faintness or loss of consciousness, seizures or convulsions, status epilepticus, coma, and respiratory arrest or cessation of breathing, potentially resulting in hospitalization, brain damage, and/or death.

A Democrat, he serves the 17th Senate District which encompasses the Central Coast. Monning was reelected to the Senate in 2016 for a second and final term. Education, the environment and public health are areas of particular interest to Senator Monning. Before his election to the State Senate in 2012, Monning served in the California State Assembly, representing the 27th Assembly District. Early life and education Bill Monning was born and raised in Southern California. He attended Flintridge Preparatory School from fifth to twelfth grade and participated in athletics including football, basketball, baseball and swimming. His college years were spent in the San Francisco Bay Area where he attended the University of California, Berkeley from 1969 to 1972 and the University of San Francisco School of Law from 1973 to 1976. During this time he also did volunteer work for the United Farm Workers legal department and participated in marches and other activities with farm workers' movements in Delano, Salinas and Modesto, meeting other activists including Jerry Cohen, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. These experiences with the UFW were influential, \\"working with the legal department as a volunteer . . . really solidified my interest and purpose in attending law school.\\" Monning received a B.A. at the University of California, Berkeley and a law degree from the University of San Francisco School of Law. He served as a Senior Fulbright Specialist, receiving Fulbright scholarships to teach and research in Peru and Chile. Additionally, he was a member of the Monterey County Court-directed mediation panel and served for four years as Executive Director of the Nobel Peace Prize winning organization, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. Career as attorney After entering the California State Bar, Monning first worked as a staff attorney for the United Farm Workers of America, AFL-CIO (1976 ‚Äì 1978). He then became Directing Attorney for California Rural Legal Assistance, Migrant Farm Worker Project (1978 -1982). From 1982 through 1987 Monning was the Director of the Salvadoran Medical Relief Fund, and from 1987 through 1991 he was Executive Director for the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW). From 1993 until his election to the State Assembly in 2008 he worked in private practice (Labor and Employment law) and taught at both the Monterey Institute of International Studies (currently Middlebury Institute of International Studies) as professor of International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and as a professor at the Monterey College of Law. Monning is also the former president and co-founder of Global Majority, Inc. Career as politician In 2008 Bill Monning ran for and won the California State District 27 Assembly seat being vacated by termed out John Laird. When asked in an interview with the National Lawyers Guild about why he decided to run for the Assembly in 2008, Monning cited California's structural budget limitations saying California was, \\"only one of three states in the union that require a 2/3 vote in both houses to pass a budget.\\" This limitation made it difficult to secure adequate funding for such needs as healthcare and education. Monning hoped to work with community groups and other legislators to effect reform in this and other areas including electoral, campaign finance and economic justice. In 2012 Monning was elected to the California State Senate after the incumbent, Sam Blakeslee, R-San Luis Obispo, chose not to run in the newly drawn 17th Senate district. Monning became Senate Majority leader in 2014 when he was appointed by then State Senate President pro tempore Kevin de Le√≥n, D-Los Angeles. Monning was reelected to the Senate in 2016 for a second and final term. In 2016 Monning seriously considered running to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Congressmen Sam Farr but felt he could be more effective in working on climate policy and other important issues as a leader in Sacramento as opposed to being a member of the minority party in Washington. In 2019 Monning was appointed to the California Coastal Conservancy by California Senate President pro tempore Toni Atkins. =Electoral history= Monning, Hsla-Coron, Cohen and Mason 2017.jpgBill Monning, Mary Hsla-Coron, Jerry Cohen and Mel Mason - panel discussion \\"What can we learn from 1960's activism to inform today's resistance movements?\\" Monning with Book.jpgMonning with book - Vision for a Healthy California Bill Monning March for Science 2017.webmBill Monning March for Science 2017 Monterey, CA Bill Monning on Climate Change.webmRecorded at a peace rally in Carmel, CA 2017 Legislation =Soda tax (SB 622)= On February 22, 2013, he introduced SB 622, which would impose a 12 cent tax on each can of soda, as well as create the Children's Health Promotion Fund, which would direct the money the tax raised to childhood obesity-preventing measures such as improving the quality of school lunches.New California Soda-Tax Bill Under ConsiderationSweetened Beverage Tax: CA Legislative Information About three months later, the bill died in committee. =Farmworker Protection= Monning authored a bill to protect California farm workers from sexual harassment and violence. Signed by Governor Jerry Brown on September 28, 2014, SB 1087 followed a 2013 investigation by Univision, UC Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program FRONTLINE, and the Center for Investigative Reporting. The investigation found that hundreds of female agriculture workers said they had been harassed and assaulted in the fields with minimal response from their supervisors or from law enforcement. The law took effect on January 1, 2015. \\"Female farmworkers are among the most vulnerable and invisible of the state's farm worker population,\\" said Monning. \\"[SB 1087] will require sexual harassment prevention training for farm labor contractors, supervisors, and employees, and is the first step to help protect these workers from unwanted sexual advances and sexual violence.\\" Senator Monning successfully authored another bill, SB 168 in 2013, to help agricultural workers get back wages and penalties owed by state-licensed farm labor contractors. According to Monning, some California contractors had fraudulently dissolved and moved their assets to new corporations, leaving farm workers without anyone to file a claim against. \\"This measure is modeled after previous legislation in the garment manufacturing and car wash industries to address fraudulent successor business scams,\\" said Monning \\"The workers most affected and victimized by such unscrupulous practices are farm workers.\\" =Death with Dignity= In 2015, Monning co-sponsored, with Lois Wolk (D-Davis), SB 128, the California End of Life Option Act. The bill was modeled after Oregon's Death With Dignity Act (1994). The law authorizes adults with six months or less to live to request a doctor's prescription for life-ending medication. It passed the California Senate easily, but stalled in the Assembly. In a legislative session in September dedicated to healthcare, several amendments were introduced, and eventually the bill passed in the Assembly 42-33, and the Senate 23-14 It was co-authored by Assembly Member Susan Talamantes Eggman (D-Stockton). California governor Jerry Brown signed the California End of Life Option Act on October 5, 2015, and it went into effect on June 9, 2016. California thus became the fifth state to pass a Death With Dignity law. In a 2018 interview with the Monterey County Weekly Monning claimed that the End of Life Option Act was \\"one of his greatest legislative achievements\\". He was very moved by the testimony of terminally ill people in Sacramento, \\"They knew that they weren't going to be able to benefit from it (the Act), and yet they still came, facing their terminal conditions, making sure that those who followed them would have options that they didn't have\\". =Climate Change= Senator Monning believes climate change is the largest long-term threat to humanity and that it will also negatively affect public health and coastal communities. In the 2015 ‚Äì 2016 legislative session Senator Monning co-authored* Senate Bill 350, the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015. This complex bill was intended to increase the state's energy efficiency, reduce petroleum use in vehicles and set new standards for California's Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Under this bill the state of California would be required to generate half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The bill was signed by Governor Jerry Brown October 7, 2015. Other sponsors of the bill were primary sponsor Senator Kevin de Le√≥n, Senator Loni Hancock, Senator Mark Leno, Assemblyman Das Williams and Assemblyman Kevin McCarty. Personal life He and his wife, Dana T. Kent, a family physician, reside in Carmel, California and have two daughters: Laura and Alexandra.

After a successful international career that brought him to London and Rome, he returned to the Austrian Netherlands where he was a sculptor to the court. Delvaux was a transitional figure between the Baroque and Neo- classicism. Life =Training= Delvaux probably trained in his native Ghent under the local sculptor J. B. van Helderberghe. At the age of 18 he went to Brussels to study under Pierre-Denis Plumier from Antwerp and attended the local drawing academy.Laurent Delvaux at the Netherlands Institute for Art History =London= He went to London in 1717 where he collaborated with his compatriot Peter Scheemakers. When they were joined by Plumier in 1721 they worked together on a number of marble funerary monuments, including that of John Sheffield, duke of Buckingham (1721‚Äì22, London, Westminster Abbey). After Plumier died soon after his arrival in 1721, Delvaux and Scheemakers are believed to have collaborated with Francis Bird on the marble monument to John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, also in Westminster Abbey.Helena Bussers. \\"Delvaux, Laurent.\\" Grove Art Online.

Web. 27 March 2014 =Rome= In Rome, Delvaux studied the work of compatriots Giambologna and Fran√ßois Duquesnoy as well as Italian sculpture of the 17th century and of his contemporaries. He keenly admired the sculpture of Classical antiquity and took the opportunity to copy newly discovered pieces. While in Rome, John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, commissioned a number of works inspired by antique examples, most notably Caunus and Byblis. This group is a free version of a sculpture by Pierre Le Gros the Younger of some 20 or so years earlier where Le Gros had deliberately added heads, hands and legs to a fragmented antique group of Amor and Psyche in such a way that it turned the love story on its head and instead of Amor showed Caunus as he vehemently defends himself against the sexual advances of his sister.Gerhard Bissell, Haud dubi√® Amoris & Psyches imagines fuerunt statu√¶ ist√¶, in: Max Kunze, Axel R√ºgler (ed.), Wiedererstandene Antike.

He also received many religious commissions including the oak group of the Conversion of St Paul dated 1736 (now in the Collegiate Church of St Gertrude in Nivelles). The same church also holds a series of oak statues of the Apostles sculpted by Delvaux in 1743‚Äì4. The pulpit (1741‚Äì5) in the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent was made by him after a design by Hendrik Frans Verbrugghen. He also made a marble funerary monument for the Van der Noot family in 1746‚Äì for the Carmelite Church in Brussels and which is now in the Rijksmuseum. After Prince Charles de Lorraine arrived in Brussels as the governor general of the Austrian Netherlands in 1741, Delvaux received many commissions for the decoration of the governor general's residences in Brussels, Tervuren (near Brussels) and Mariemont, Belgium in Hainaut. For the palace in Brussels, which survives partially, he created allegorical reliefs for the fa√ßade and the staircase and free-standing statues, including a marble Hercules at the foot of the stairs. Delvaux also worked for other European courts such as that of Portugal and for major abbeys like those at Afflighem, Floreffe and Villers. In 1734 he settled in Nivelles. In addition to monumental work, Delvaux created many excellent models in terracotta. Many Belgian churches and museums in Brussels and Ghent hold works by him. Pupils Among Delvaux's students were the sculptors Gilles-Lambert Godecharle, Pierre-Fran√ßois Le Roy, Laurent Joseph Tamine, Adrien-Joseph Anrion and Joseph Wilton. Delvaux's grandson √âdouard Delvaux (1806-1862) was a rural painter and a student of Henri Van Assche (1774-1841).

The Inner House of the Court of Session held that the pursuer had taken a chance, fully aware of the risks involved and that the Board had no responsibility to maintain the fence any more than they had.Mark Lunney, Ken Oliphant, Tort Law: Text and Materials (OUP, 2008) 286, Judgment The House of Lords dismissed the claimant's final appeal, holding that she was not owed any duty under the Occupiers' Liability (Scotland) Act 1960 on the grounds that she had voluntarily decided to run the risk of walking on the railway line. As such, the defender had no duty, at least in relation to the pursuer, to maintain the fence any better than they had, based on the principle of volenti non fit injuria.

Early life and family Naganathan was born on 31 January 1906 in Madras, India. He was the son of John Jebaratnam Hensman, registrar of the University of Madras. The Hensman family were from Ceylon but moved to South India for education and work. Naganathan's father (John Jebaratnam Hensman), grandfather (Charles Hensman) and great-grandfather (Rev. John Hensman) had all been born in Ceylon. After school Naganathan joined Madras Medical College, qualifying as a medical doctor. He then went to the United Kingdom, obtained the MRCP and FRCS qualifications and practised medicine for a period. Naganathan married Retnavathi, daughter of John Wirt Ponniah Senathirajah from Alaveddy. They had three daughters (Mary Lukshmi, Anne Nirmala and Carmel Indhira) and two sons (Elangai Anthony and John). Career After returning to Ceylon Naganathan worked as a private medical practitioner in Colombo. Naganathan was an active member of the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) and served as its secretary in 1947. He was elected to the Senate of Ceylon in 1947. In 1948 division arose amongst ACTC members over the party leadership's decision to join the United National Party (UNP) led government. Naganathan was one of those who opposed joining the UNP government. The dissidents, led by S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, C. Vanniasingam and Naganathan, eventually left the ACTC and formed the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (Federal Party) in 1949. Naganathan was ITAK's secretary for a period and became the party's president in 1966. Naganathan stood as the ITAK's candidate in Jaffna at the 1952 and 1956 parliamentary elections but on each occasion was defeated by the ACTC leader G. G. Ponnambalam. Naganathan stood as the ITAK's (Federal Party) candidate in Nallur at the March 1960 parliamentary election. He won the election and entered Parliament. He was re- elected at the July 1960 and 1965 and parliamentary elections but lost out to the ACTC candidate C. Arulampalam at the 1970 parliamentary election. On 5 June 1956 a group of Tamil activists and parliamentarians, including Naganathan, staged a satyagraha against the Sinhala Only Act on Galle Face Green opposite the Parliament. The satyagrahis were attacked by a Sinhalese mob as the police looked on, and Naganathan and V. N. Navaratnam were thrown in the lake. Following the 1958 riots ITAK and the Jathika Vimukthi Peramuna (National Liberation Front) were banned. ITAK's leaders, including Naganathan, were arrested on 4 June 1958 as they left Parliament and imprisoned. Naganathan played a leading role in the 1961 satyagraha campaign organised by ITAK. Early on the morning of 20 February 1961 a group of 55 to 75 persons staged a satyagraha at the Jaffna Kachcheri in Old Park. Among them were ITAK MPs A. Amirthalingam, S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, V. Dharmalingam, V. A. Kandiah, Naganathan, V. N. Navaratnam and K. Thurairatnam. A large group of policemen arrived in riot gear, wearing helmets and carrying batons and shields. The police started removing the protesters by lifting and carrying them away. Those who resisted were dragged away. Later, as Government Agent M. Srikantha and Superintendent of Police Richard Arndt tried to leave Old Park in a jeep the protesters blocked their way. The police reacted with brutality, beating he protesters with batons and pulled them out bodily. Palaniyappan, a young man who had thrown himself in front of the jeep was pulled away by the police and beaten severely with batons. Five ITAK MPs were amongst the protesters blocking the jeep. Kandiah was carried out and dumped on the ground, Dharmalingam and Thurairatnam were dragged out by their hands and legs whilst Amirthalingam and Naganathan were baton charged. The police also baton charged a crowd of around 5,000 who had gathered to watch the satyagraha. Naganathan died on 16 August 1971.

Community Village hall The village is scattered around the \\"30 foot\\" contour road. which joins Fulstow to the neighbouring villages of Covenham and Alvingham to the south and Tetney to the north. Fulstow is on the Greenwich Meridian Line, has fresh water springs, and a population of approximately 550. Fulstow is listed in the 1086 Domesday survey as \\"Fuglestow\\". Fulstow Grade II listed Anglican church is dedicated to St Lawrence. It originates from the early 13th century and is in Early English style.Kelly's Directory of Lincolnshire with the port of Hull 1885, p. 402 In 1885 Kelly's Directory recorded the existence of three village chapels: Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist and Wesleyan Reformers. Agriculture centred on the growing of wheat, barley, oats and turnips. The ecclesiastical parish of Fulstow is part of the Fotherby Group of the Deanery of Louthesk. The 2013 incumbent is The Rev'd Sue Allison. The civil parish, with the same boundaries, is represented by a parish council. The Village hall was built in 1986 and is used for community functions. Unlike many other village halls this one is self funding and not Parish Council controlled. There were once two public houses in the village, the Lord Nelson and the Cross Keys, but the Lord Nelson closed in 1969. The post office and general store was still operating until 2010, but was described in 2012 as \\"closed and derelict\\". The post office is now part of the Cross Keys public house. The village primary school was opened in 1869 by with local subscription,  Trivia  * Fulstow was once referred to as \\"Britain's most lawless village\\" in the Times newspaper in the 1901 due to its history of drunken violence and self-policing in its secluded geographical location. * Due to its location in the marshes of Lincolnshire as well as the surrounding roads, there is no reason to pass through the village and Fulstow can be easily missed unless specifically intended. * Since the early 2000's there has been a growing independence movement within the village (and surrounding areas). Primarily stemming from ideas surrounding the historical isle and Kingdom of Lindsey. Supported by a growing general disillusionment with the UK government at both a local and national level, and the idea that due to the land reclamation and drainage of the area beginning the middle ages onwards, the movement suggests that it is the land of the people and not that of a governmental state. The independent culture of the region's inhabitants has been around much longer however, and was even noted by E. H Rudkin, specifically in their book of Lincolnshire Folklore when commenting on the local belief in the bog spirts called Tiddy Mun. * People \\"born\\" or have resided within the village for a significant amount of time refer to themselves as \\"Fulstownians\\" - in a similar vain of the medieval tribes that previously inhabited the area, such as the Corieltauvi and later, the Lindisfaras. There are various groups on social media dedicated, restricted and strictly monitored to include only those who can trace heritage back to the village.

Heresy is any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs or customs, in particular the accepted beliefs of a church or religious organization. The term is usually used in reference to violations of important religious teachings, but is also used of views strongly opposed to any generally accepted ideas. A heretic is a proponent of heresy. The term is used particularly in reference to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.Sandle, Mark. 2007. \\"Soviet and Eastern bloc Marxism.\\" Pp. 59‚Äì77 in Twentieth-Century Marxism, edited by D. Glaser and D. M. Walker. London: Routledge. . p. 62. In certain historical Christian, Muslim and Jewish cultures, among others, espousing ideas deemed heretical has been (and in some cases still is) met with censure ranging from excommunication to the death penalty. Heresy is distinct from apostasy, which is the explicit renunciation of one's religion, principles or cause; and from blasphemy, which is an impious utterance or action concerning God or sacred things. Heresiology is the study of heresy. Etymology Derived from Ancient Greek ha√≠resis (), the English heresy originally meant 'choice' or 'thing chosen'.Cross, F. L., and E. A. Livingstone, eds. 1974. \\"Heresy.\\" The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2nd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. However, it came to mean the \\"party, or school, of a man's choice,\\"Bruce, F. F. 1964. The Spreading Flame. Exeter: Paternoster. p. 249. and also referred to that process whereby a young person would examine various philosophies to determine how to live. The word heresy is usually used within a Christian, Jewish, or Islamic context, and implies slightly different meanings in each. The founder or leader of a heretical movement is called a heresiarch, while individuals who espouse heresy or commit heresy are known as heretics. Christianity Former German Catholic friar Martin Luther was famously excommunicated as a heretic by Pope Leo X by his Papal bull Decet Romanum Pontificem in 1520. To this day, the Papal decree has not been rescinded. According to Titus 3:10 a divisive person should be warned twice before separating from him. The Greek for the phrase \\"divisive person\\" became a technical term in the early Church for a type of \\"heretic\\" who promoted dissension.The NIV Study Bible. London: Zondervan / Hodder & Stoughton. 1987. Titus 3:10n. In contrast, correct teaching is called sound not only because it builds up the faith, but because it protects it against the corrupting influence of false teachers.The NIV Study Bible. London: Zondervan / Hodder & Stoughton. 1987. Titus 1:9n. Some Church Fathers identified Jews and Judaism with heresy. They saw deviations from orthodox Christianity as heresies that were essentially Jewish in spirit. Tertullian implied that it was the Jews who most inspired heresy in Christianity: \\"From the Jew the heretic has accepted guidance in this discussion [that Jesus was not the Christ].\\" The use of the word heresy was given wide currency by Irenaeus in his 2nd century tract Contra Haereses (Against Heresies) to describe and discredit his opponents during the early centuries of the Christian community. He described the community's beliefs and doctrines as orthodox (from , orthos, 'straight' + , doxa, 'belief') and the Gnostics' teachings as heretical. He also pointed out the concept of apostolic succession to support his arguments. Appendices provide a timeline of Councils, Schisms, Heresies and Persecutions in the years 193-604. They are described in the text. Constantine the Great, who along with Licinius had decreed toleration of Christianity in the Roman Empire by what is commonly called the \\"Edict of Milan\\",Cross, F.L.; Livingstone, E.A., eds. (1974). \\"Milan, Edict of\\". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (2 ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press. and was the first Roman Emperor baptized, set precedents for later policy. By Roman law the Emperor was Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of the College of Pontiffs (Collegium Pontificum) of all recognized religions in ancient Rome. To put an end to the doctrinal debate initiated by Arius, Constantine called the first of what would afterwards be called the ecumenical councilsChadwick, Henry. 1967. The Early Christian Church. Pelican. pp. 129-30. and then enforced orthodoxy by Imperial authority. The Emperor established and enforced orthodoxy for domestic tranquility and the efficacy of prayers in support of the empire. The first known usage of the term in a legal context was in AD 380 by the Edict of Thessalonica of Theodosius I, As Christianity placed its stamp upon the Empire, the Emperor shaped the church for political purposes. which made Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire. Prior to the issuance of this edict, the Church had no state-sponsored support for any particular legal mechanism to counter what it perceived as \\"heresy\\". By this edict the state's authority and that of the Church became somewhat overlapping. One of the outcomes of this blurring of Church and state was the sharing of state powers of legal enforcement with church authorities. This reinforcement of the Church's authority gave church leaders the power to, in effect, pronounce the death sentence upon those whom the church considered heretical. Within six years of the official criminalization of heresy by the Emperor, the first Christian heretic to be executed, Priscillian, was condemned in 386 by Roman secular officials for sorcery, and put to death with four or five followers.Bassett, Paul M. 2013. \\"Priscillian.\\" Pp. 949‚Äì50 in Encyclopedia of Early Christianity (2nd ed.), edited by E. Ferguson. Routledge. . p. 950.John Anthony McGuckin, The Westminister Handbook to Patristic Theology (Westminster John Knox Press 2004 ), p. 284 However, his accusers were excommunicated both by Ambrose of Milan and Pope Siricius,Chadwick, Henry. The Early Church, Pelican, London, 1967. p.171 who opposed Priscillian's heresy, but \\"believed capital punishment to be inappropriate at best and usually unequivocally evil.\\" The edict of Theodosius II (435) provided severe punishments for those who had or spread writings of Nestorius. Those who possessed writings of Arius were sentenced to death. For some years after the Reformation, Protestant churches were also known to execute those they considered heretics, including Catholics. The last known heretic executed by sentence of the Catholic Church was Spanish schoolmaster Cayetano Ripoll in 1826. The number of people executed as heretics under the authority of the various \\"ecclesiastical authorities\\" is not known. =Catholicism= Massacre of the Waldensians of M√©rindol in 1545. In the Catholic Church, obstinate and willful manifest heresy is considered to spiritually cut one off from the Church, even before excommunication is incurred. The Codex Justinianus (1:5:12) defines \\"everyone who is not devoted to the Catholic Church and to our Orthodox holy Faith\\" a heretic. The Church had always dealt harshly with strands of Christianity that it considered heretical, but before the 11th century these tended to centre on individual preachers or small localised sects, like Arianism, Pelagianism, Donatism, Marcionism and Montanism. The diffusion of the almost Manichaean sect of Paulicians westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of Bogomils in modern-day Bulgaria, a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianity. By the 11th century, more organised groups such as the Patarini, the Dulcinians, the Waldensians and the Cathars were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of northern Italy, southern France and Flanders. In France the Cathars grew to represent a popular mass movement and the belief was spreading to other areas.\\"Massacre of the Pure.\\" Time. April 28, 1961. The Cathar Crusade was initiated by the Catholic Church to eliminate the Cathar heresy in Languedoc.Joseph Reese Strayer (1992). The Albigensian Crusades. University of Michigan Press. p. 143. Heresy was a major justification for the Inquisition (Inquisitio Haereticae Pravitatis, Inquiry on Heretical Perversity) and for the European wars of religion associated with the Protestant Reformation. Cristiano Banti's 1857 painting Galileo facing the Roman Inquisition. Galileo Galilei was brought before the Inquisition for heresy, but abjured his views and was sentenced to house arrest, under which he spent the rest of his life. Galileo was found \\"vehemently suspect of heresy\\", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe, and that the Earth is not at its centre and moves, and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture. He was required to \\"abjure, curse and detest\\" those opinions.Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288‚Äì293). Pope Gregory I stigmatized Judaism and the Jewish people in many of his writings. He described Jews as enemies of Christ: \\"The more the Holy Spirit fills the world, the more perverse hatred dominates the souls of the Jews.\\" He labeled all heresy as \\"Jewish\\", claiming that Judaism would \\"pollute [Catholics and] deceive them with sacrilegious seduction.\\" The identification of Jews and heretics in particular occurred several times in Roman-Christian law.Constitutio Sirmondiana 6, 14; Theodosius II - Novella 3; Codex Theodosianus 16:5:44, 16:8:27, 16:8:27; Codex Justinianus 1:3:54, 1:5:12,21, 1:10:2; Justinian, Novellae 37, 45 Hussite heretics defeated five anti-Hussite Crusades ordered by the Pope. =Eastern Orthodox Church= In Eastern Orthodox Christianity heresy most commonly refers to those beliefs declared heretical by the first seven Ecumenical Councils. Since the Great Schism and the Protestant Reformation, various Christian churches have also used the concept in proceedings against individuals and groups those churches deemed heretical. The Orthodox Church also rejects the early Christian heresies such as Arianism, Gnosticism, Origenism, Montanism, Judaizers, Marcionism, Docetism, Adoptionism, Nestorianism, Monophysitism, Monothelitism and Iconoclasm. =Protestantism= In his work \\"On the Jews and Their Lies\\" (1543), German Reformation leader Martin Luther claims that Jewish history was \\"assailed by much heresy\\", and that Christ the logos swept away the Jewish heresy and goes on to do so, \\"as it still does daily before our eyes.\\" He stigmatizes Jewish prayer as being \\"blasphemous\\" and a lie, and vilifies Jews in general as being spiritually \\"blind\\" and \\"surely possessed by all devils.\\" In England, the 16th-century European Reformation resulted in a number of executions on charges of heresy. During the thirty-eight years of Henry VIII's reign, about sixty heretics, mainly Protestants, were executed and a rather greater number of Catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason, notably Sir Thomas More and Cardinal John Fisher, for refusing to accept the king's supremacy over the Church in England.Christenson, Ron. 1991. Political Trials in History. Transaction Publishers. . p. 302.O'Donovan, Oliver, and Joan Lockwood O'Donovan. 1999. From Irenaeus to Grotius. Eerdmans. . p. 558. Under Edward VI, the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by Mary I; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity).Dickens, A.G. The English Reformation Fontana/Collins 1967, p.327/p.364 Under Mary, around two hundred and ninety people were burned at the stake between 1555 and 1558 after the restoration of papal jurisdiction. When Elizabeth I came to the throne, the concept of heresy was retained in theory but severely restricted by the 1559 Act of Supremacy and the one hundred and eighty or so Catholics who were executed in the forty-five years of her reign were put to death because they were considered members of \\"a subversive fifth column.\\"Neill, Stephen. Anglicanism. Pelican. pp. 96‚Äì7. The last execution of a \\"heretic\\" in England occurred under James VI and I in 1612.MacCulloch, Diarmaid. 1996. Thomas Cranmer. Yale University Press. p. 477. Although the charge was technically one of \\"blasphemy\\" there was one later execution in Scotland (still at that date an entirely independent kingdom) when in 1697 Thomas Aikenhead was accused, among other things, of denying the doctrine of the Trinity.MacCulloch, Diarmaid. 2003. The Reformation. Penguin. p. 679. Another example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the Boston martyrs in 1659, 1660, and 1661. These executions resulted from the actions of the Anglican Puritans, who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. At the time, the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a \\"purer absolute theocracy\\" within their colony. As such, they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical, even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived \\"heresies.\\" =Modern era= The trial and subsequent execution of heretics under the banner of Christianity came to an end in 1826 with the last execution of a \\"heretic,\\" Cayetano Ripoll, by the Spanish Inquisition. Although less common than in earlier periods, in modern times, formal charges of heresy within Christian churches still occur. Issues in the Protestant churches have included modern biblical criticism and the nature of God. In the Catholic Church, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith criticizes writings for \\"ambiguities and errors\\" without using the word \\"heresy.\\"An example is the Notification regarding certain writings of Fr. Marciano Vidal, C.Ss.R. Perhaps due to the many modern negative connotations associated with the term heretic, such as the Spanish inquisition, the term is used less often today. The subject of Christian heresy opens up broader questions as to who has a monopoly on spiritual truth, as explored by Jorge Luis Borges in the short story \\"The Theologians\\" within the compilation Labyrinths. On 11 July 2007, Pope Benedict XVI stated that some Protestant groups are \\"ecclesial communities\\" rather than Churches.Cf. the documents \\"Responses to Some Questions\\" and \\"Commentary\\" from the Congregation on the Doctrine of the Faith. Representatives of some of these Christian denominations accused the Vatican of effectively calling them heretics.\\"Dismay and anger as Pope declares Protestants cannot have churches.\\" The Guardian. 11 July 2007.\\"Will the Pope's Pronouncement Set Ecumenism Back a Hundred Years?\\" Progressive Theology. 11 July 2007 However, Pope Benedict XVI clarified that the phrase \\"ecclesial community\\" did not necessitate explicit heresy, but only that the communities lacked certain \\"essential elements\\" of an apostolic church, as he had written in the document Dominus Iesus. Islam Mehdiana Sahib: the Killing of Bhai Dayala, a Sikh, by the Mughals at Chandni Chowk, India in 1675 Starting in medieval times, Muslims began to refer to heretics and those who antagonized Islam as zindiqs, the charge being punishable by death.John Bowker. \\"Zindiq.\\" The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions. 1997 Ottoman Sultan Selim the Grim regarded the Shia Qizilbash as heretics, reportedly proclaimed that \\"the killing of one Shiite had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.\\"ƒÄl-e-A·∏•mad, JalƒÅl. 1982. Plagued by the West, translated by P. Sprachman. Center for Iranian Studies, Columbia University. . Shia, in general, have often been accused by Sunnis of being heretics. To Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, Sikhs were heretics. In some modern day nations and regions, heresy remains an offense punishable by death. One example is the 1989 fatwa issued by the government of Iran, offering a substantial bounty for anyone who succeeds in the assassination of author Salman Rushdie, whose writings were declared as heretical. Moreover, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is considered an Islamic heresy in Iran, with systematic persecution of Bah√° º√≠s. Judaism Orthodox Judaism considers views on the part of Jews who depart from traditional Jewish principles of faith heretical. In addition, the more right- wing groups within Orthodox Judaism hold that all Jews who reject the simple meaning of Maimonides's 13 principles of Jewish faith are heretics.Shapiro, Marc B. The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised. . (A book written as a contentious rebuttal to an article written in the Torah u'Maddah Journal.) As such, most of Orthodox Judaism considers Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism heretical movements, and regards most of Conservative Judaism as heretical. The liberal wing of Modern Orthodoxy is more tolerant of Conservative Judaism, particularly its right wing, as there is some theological and practical overlap between these groups. Other religions The act of using Church of Scientology techniques in a form different than originally described by L. Ron Hubbard is referred to within Scientology as \\"squirreling\\" and is said by Scientologists to be high treason. The Religious Technology Center has prosecuted breakaway groups that have practiced Scientology outside the official Church without authorization. Although Zoroastrianism has had an historical tolerance for other religions, it also held sects like Zurvanism and Mazdakism heretical to its main dogma and has violently persecuted them, such as burying Mazdakians with their feet upright as \\"human gardens.\\" In later periods Zoroastrians cooperated with Muslims to kill other Zoroastrians deemed as heretical.Houtsma, Martijn Theodoor (1936), First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913-1936: E.J.Brill's, BRILL, , 9789004097964 Buddhist and Taoist monks in medieval China often called the other \\"heretics\\" and competed to be praised by the royal court. Although today most Chinese believe in a hybrid of the \\"Three Teachings\\" (Buddhism, Taoism, Confucian) the bias may still be seen in some teachings and commentaries by both religions. Neo-Confucian heresy has also been described. Non-religious usage In other contexts the term does not necessarily have pejorative overtones and may even be complimentary when used, in areas where innovation is welcome, of ideas that are in fundamental disagreement with the status quo in any practice and branch of knowledge. Scientist/author Isaac Asimov considered heresy as an abstraction, mentioning religious, political, socioeconomic and scientific heresies. Asimov's views are in \\"Forward: The Role of the Heretic\\". He divided scientific heretics into: endoheretics, those from within the scientific community; and exoheretics, those from without. Characteristics were ascribed to both and examples of both kinds were offered. Asimov concluded that science orthodoxy defends itself well against endoheretics (by control of science education, grants and publication as examples), but is nearly powerless against exoheretics. He acknowledged by examples that heresy has repeatedly become orthodoxy. Publishing his findings as The Dinosaur Heresies, revisionist paleontologist Robert T. Bakker, himself a scientific endoheretic, treated the mainstream view of dinosaurs as dogma: > I have enormous respect for dinosaur paleontologists past and present. But > on average, for the last fifty years, the field hasn't tested dinosaur > orthodoxy severely enough. He adds that, \\"Most taxonomists, however, have viewed such new terminology as dangerously destabilizing to the traditional and well-known scheme.\\" The illustrations by the author show dinosaurs in very active poses, in contrast to the traditional perception of lethargy. Immanuel Velikovsky is an example of a recent scientific exoheretic; he did not have appropriate scientific credentials or did not publish in scientific journals. While the details of his work are in scientific disrepute, the concept of catastrophic change (extinction event and punctuated equilibrium) has gained acceptance in recent decades. The term heresy is used not only with regard to religion but also in the context of political theory. The term heresy is also used as an ideological pigeonhole for contemporary writers because, by definition, heresy depends on contrasts with an established orthodoxy. For example, the tongue- in-cheek contemporary usage of heresy, such as to categorize a \\"Wall Street heresy\\" a \\"Democratic heresy\\" or a \\"Republican heresy,\\" are metaphors that invariably retain a subtext that links orthodoxies in geology or biology or any other field to religion. These expanded metaphoric senses allude to both the difference between the person's views and the mainstream and the boldness of such a person in propounding these views.

Primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two continents is a historical social construct, as they have no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of the six, five, or four continents on Earth. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on paleomagnetic data. Eurasia covers around , or around 36.2% of the Earth's total land area. The landmass contains well over 5 billion people, equating to approximately 70% of the human population. Humans first settled in Eurasia between 60,000 and 125,000 years ago. Some major islands, including Great Britain, Iceland, Ireland, and Sri Lanka, as well as those of Japan, the Philippines, and most of Indonesia, are often included in the popular definition of Eurasia, in spite of being separate from the contiguous landmass. Physiographically, Eurasia is a single continent. The concepts of Europe and Asia as distinct continents date back to antiquity, and their borders are geologically arbitrary. In ancient times the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, along with their associated straits, were seen as separating the continents, but today the Ural and Caucasus ranges are more seen as the main delimiters between the two. Eurasia is connected to Africa at the Suez Canal, and Eurasia is sometimes combined with Africa to make the largest contiguous landmass on Earth called Afro-Eurasia. Due to the vast landmass and differences in latitude, Eurasia exhibits all types of climate under the K√∂ppen classification, including the harshest types of hot and cold temperatures, high and low precipitation and various types of ecosystems. Geology The boundary of 13th century Mongol Empire and location of today's Mongols in modern Mongolia, Russia and China. Eurasia formed between 375 and 325 million years ago with the merging of Siberia, Kazakhstania, and Baltica, which was joined to Laurentia, now North America, to form Euramerica. Chinese cratons collided with Siberia's southern coast. History Eurasia has been the host of many ancient civilizations, including those based in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and China. In the Axial Age (mid-first millennium BC), a continuous belt of civilizations stretched through the Eurasian subtropical zone from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This belt became the mainstream of world history for two millennia. Geopolitics Originally, ‚ÄúEurasia‚Äù is a geographical notion: in this sense, it is simply the biggest continent; the combined landmass of Europe and Asia. However, geopolitically, the word has several meanings, reflecting specific geopolitical interests. ‚ÄúEurasia‚Äù is one of the most important geopolitical concepts and it figures prominently in the commentaries on the ideas of Halford Mackinder. As Zbigniew Brzezinski observed on Eurasia: The Russian \\"Eurasianism\\" corresponded initially more or less to the land area of Imperial Russia in 1914, including parts of Eastern Europe. One of Russia's main geopolitical interests lies in ever closer integration with those countries that it considers part of ‚ÄúEurasia.‚Äù This concept is further integrated with communist eschatology by author Alexander Dugin as the guiding principle of \\"self-sufficiency of a large space\\" during expansion. The term Eurasia gained geopolitical reputation as one of the three superstates in 1984, George Orwell's novel where constant surveillance and propaganda are strategic elements (introduced as reflexive antagonists) of the heterogeneous dispositif such metapolitical constructs use in order to control and exercise power. Single markets in European and post Soviet countries; European Economic Area and Common Economic Space Regional organisations and alliances Across Eurasia, several single markets have emerged including the Eurasian Economic Space, European Single Market, ASEAN Economic Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council. There are also several international organizations and initiatives which seek to promote integration throughout Eurasia, including: ASEM Partners =Asia-Europe Meeting= * Every two years since 1996 a meeting of most Asian and European countries is organised as the Asia‚ÄìEurope Meeting (ASEM). =Commonwealth of Independent States= * The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is a political and economic association of 10 post-Soviet republics in Eurasia formed following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It has an estimated population of 239,796,010. The CIS encourages cooperation in economical, political and military affairs and has certain powers to coordinate trade, finance, lawmaking and security. In addition, six members of the CIS have joined the Collective Security Treaty Organization, an intergovernmental military alliance that was founded in 1992. =Eurasian Union= * Similar in concept to the European Union, the Eurasian Union is an economic union established in 2015 including Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and observer member Moldova and is headquartered in Moscow, Russia and Minsk, Belarus. The union promotes economic integration among members and is theoretically open to enlargement of any country in Europe or Asia. =Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges= * The Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS) is an international organization headquartered in Yerevan, comprising the main stock exchanges in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. The purpose of the Federation is to contribute to the cooperation, development, support and promotion of capital markets in the Eurasian region. Area from Lisbon to Vladivostok with all European and CIS countries =Russia-EU Common Spaces= * The Russia - EU Four Common Spaces Initiative, is a joint European Union and Russian agreement with the aim to closer integrate Russia and the EU, remove barriers to trade and investment and promote reforms and competitiveness. In 2010, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called for common economic space, free-trade area or more advanced economic integration, stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok. However, no significant progress was made and the project was put on hold after Russia-EU relations deteriorated following the Ukrainian crisis in 2013. =Shanghai Cooperation Organisation= * The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is a Eurasian political, economic and security alliance, the creation of which was announced on 15 June 2001 in Shanghai, China. It is the largest regional organisation in the world in terms of geographical coverage and population, covering three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half of the human population. Use of term =History of the Europe‚ÄìAsia division= Physical map of Asia In ancient times, the Greeks classified Europe (derived from the mythological Phoenician princess Europa) and Asia (derived from Asia, a woman in Greek mythology) as separate \\"lands\\". Where to draw the dividing line between the two regions is still a matter of discussion. Especially whether the Kuma-Manych Depression or the Caucasus Mountains form the southeast boundary is disputed, since Mount Elbrus would be part of Europe in the latter case, making it (and not Mont Blanc) Europe's highest mountain. Most accepted is probably the boundary as defined by Philip Johan von Strahlenberg in the 18th century. He defined the dividing line along the Aegean Sea, Dardanelles, Sea of Marmara, Bosporus, Black Sea, Kuma‚ÄìManych Depression, Caspian Sea, Ural River, and Ural Mountains. =Geography= In modern usage, the term \\"Eurasian\\" is a demonym usually meaning \\"of or relating to Eurasia\\" or \\"a native or inhabitant of Eurasia\\".American Heritage Dictionary It is also used to describe people of combined \\"Asian\\" and \\"European\\" descent. Located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres, Eurasia is considered a supercontinent, part of the supercontinent of Afro-Eurasia or simply a continent in its own right. In plate tectonics, the Eurasian Plate includes Europe and most of Asia but not the Indian subcontinent, the Arabian Peninsula or the area of the Russian Far East east of the Chersky Range. From the point of view of history and culture, Eurasia can be loosely subdivided into Western and Eastern Eurasia.\\"Anthropologically, historically and linguistically Eurasia is more appropriately, though vaguely subdivided into West Eurasia (often including North Africa) and East Eurasia\\", Anita Sengupta, Heartlands of Eurasia: The Geopolitics of Political Space, Lexington Books, 2009, p.25 =Soviet states after decentralization= Changes in national boundaries after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc Nineteenth-century Russian philosopher Nikolai Danilevsky defined Eurasia as an entity separate from Europe and Asia, bounded by the Himalayas, the Caucasus, the Alps, the Arctic, the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, a definition that has been influential in Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. Nowadays, partly inspired by this usage, the term Eurasia is sometimes used to refer to the post-Soviet space ‚Äì in particular Russia, the Central Asian republics, and the Transcaucasian republics ‚Äì and sometimes also adjacent regions such as Turkey, Mongolia, Afghanistan and Xinjiang. The word \\"Eurasia\\" is often used in Kazakhstan to describe its location. Numerous Kazakh institutions have the term in their names, like the L. N. Gumilev Eurasian National University (; ) (Lev Gumilev's Eurasianism ideas having been popularized in Kazakhstan by Olzhas Suleimenov), the Eurasian Media Forum, the Eurasian Cultural Foundation (), the Eurasian Development Bank (), and the Eurasian Bank. In 2007 Kazakhstan's president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, proposed building a \\"Eurasia Canal\\" to connect the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea via Russia's Kuma-Manych Depression in order to provide Kazakhstan and other Caspian-basin countries with a more efficient path to the ocean than the existing Volga-Don Canal.Canal will link Caspian Sea to world (The Times, 29 June 2007) This usage can also be seen in the names of Eurasianet, The Journal of Eurasian Studies, and the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies, as well as the titles of numerous academic programmes at US universities. This usage is comparable to how Americans use \\"Western Hemisphere\\" to describe concepts and organizations dealing with the Americas (e.g., Council on Hemispheric Affairs, Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation).

The later mansion was built up against its north, west and south walls. Monivea Castle is a former O'Kelly tower house, located near Monivea in County Galway, Ireland. It was acquired by the ffrench family, one of the fourteen Tribes of Galway, who developed it further, enhancing the lands and building the Monivea Castle‚Äîall increasing the fortification around the original Norman tower. Monivea Castle in its prime in 1876, occupied 10,121 acres of land, including the features of the tower house ruins, Monivea Castle itself, the ffrench Mausoleum and Monivea Woods. The demesne lands surrounding Monivea Castle were worked directly for the benefit of the landlord. Further outlying lands were rented out for farming. Estate farmers and domestic servants lived in the surrounding region, the town of Monivea taking shape from this initial population, homes and servicing merchant posts. Features =Monivea Castle= Monivea Castle resides in the midst of extensive woodlands, encompassed by a stone fence and five rows of enormous beech trees. Monivea Castle has two gate-lodges, one to the right of the main gate entry, where staff screened or welcomed visitors. =ffrench Mausoleum= The Ffrench Mausoleum, Monivea Set in a clearing amidst the trees of Monivea Wood, the ffrench Mausoleum and chapel was commissioned by Kathleen ffrench in honour of her late father, Robert Percy ffrench. In 1914, the Pope granted an indult, permitting official mass celebrations on special occasions and under special circumstances. Designed by architect Francis Persse (younger brother of Augusta Gregory), the mausoleum took four years to construct, at a cost of ¬£10,000 (near two million in today's economy). Built of rough-granite blocks quarried in Wicklow, the structure resembles a small castle, approximately 25-feet-wide by 30-feet-high, with crenellation along the roofline, and featuring a back, left turret. Stone steps lead up to a gothic-archway and heavy oak door secured with decorative rod iron hinges. Entering into the ffrench Mousoleum, strategically placed stained glass windows provide the only source of light and create a serene atmosphere. The building has no electricity. A central window, depicting the Resurrection, is set into the stone wall, behind the black and white marble altar bearing a carved Maltese cross. The east-facing triple-lancet stained-glass window is positioned so the rising sun lights upon the memorial sculpture. On each side wall, Munich-style stained glass windows illustrate twelve of the fourteen Tribes of Galway. All of the intricately designed windows were created by Franz Mayer & Co.‚Äîa famous German stained glass design and manufacturing company based in Munich. Mayer of Munich, still in business today, was the principal creator of stained glass for Roman Catholic churches constructed during the nineteenth and early twentieth century, including St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Paired granite pillars guard the entrance to the barrel-vaulted chancel, four black marble pillars provide structural support. The mausoleum's high-vaulted ceiling and granite gothic arches shelter a life-size cararra marble effigy of Robert Percy ffrench lying in state. Francesco Jerace, a Calabrian sculptor, created a true likeness of Robert ffrench, lying on his back, feet to door, covered by white, rhythmically draped carved marble with an inscribed Maltese cross. On the side of ffrench's effigy is carved: ‚ÄúIl lui sera beaucoup pardonne car il a beaucoup aime.‚Äù He will be forgiven much because he has loved much. =Monivea Woods= Situated 17 miles east of Galway city, north of Athenry, the estate of Monivea, once mainly bogland, has been reclaimed as useful land through the careful handling by successive generations of the ffrench family. Lime and sheep carcasses integrated into the soil provide nutrients to plants and trees, encouraging growth and subsequently stabilising the soil. Robert Percy ffrench continued to develop the estate by acquiring more land, and planting an extensive parkland surrounded by five rows of large beech trees. Monivea Woods provided a forest home for wildlife, including fox, hare, squirrel and migratory birds. It was the site for regular hunts with the local Galway Blazers. Kathleen, who inherited Monivea Castle from her father Robert ffrench, enjoyed the excitement of these events, as well as walks and recreation in the peaceful woodlands. Under the stewardship of the ffrench family, the property continued to flourish, and today, Monivea Woods is known for its unique flora and archaeology. The broadleaf forest offers a natural habitat for Irish wild fungi, lichens, bryophytes and native plants. The trees provide nesting sites and song posts for birds, encouraging the habitat of larger species of birds such as Wood Pigeons, Sparrowhawks and Jays. Lower shrubs provide shelter for small mammals. Seed-bearing plants and forest insects supply an easy food source. Monivea Woods is regarded now as being one of the most environmentally diverse and vulnerable parts of East County Galway. According to a 2002 report funded by Ireland's Department of Environment and Local Government, \\"Only 9% of Ireland has any forest cover at all today and less than 1% of the surface of the island contains forest established before 1600.\\" Monivea Woods is not only an ecological achievement but a resource for continued development of Ireland's biodiversity. Controversy Upon the death of Kathleen ffrench in 1938, with no heir apparent, she bequeathed Monivea Castle, including the estate to the Irish Nation. Kathleen's Will states: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background-color: #EEEEEE;\\" -----  \\"I give devise and bequeath to the Irish Nation the demesne of Monivea with the Castle including Kilbeg and Currendoo, the bogs, reclaimed lands and plantations, on condition that no parcel of these remains of my former estate shall ever be sold or the old trees cut down unless they fall to pieces.\\" } External links *http://monivea.galway-ireland.ie/monivea-castle.htm *http://www.jean- lombard.com References Castles in County Galway Monuments and memorials in Ireland Tourist attractions in County Galway Protected areas of County Galway Ruins in the Republic of Ireland Stained glass ","title":"Monivea Castle"},{"id":"20611123","text":"Daniel Hall√©, Christ and the Virgin appearing to St Francis, 1671.

NASA image showing Antarctica and the South Pole in 2005. The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of Earth and lies on the opposite side of Earth from the North Pole. Situated on the continent of Antarctica, it is the site of the United States Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station, which was established in 1956 and has been permanently staffed since that year. The Geographic South Pole is distinct from the South Magnetic Pole, the position of which is defined based on Earth's magnetic field. The South Pole is at the centre of the Southern Hemisphere. Geography  The Ceremonial South Pole in 1998. The Ceremonial South Pole as of February 2008. For most purposes, the Geographic South Pole is defined as the southern point of the two points where Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface (the other being the Geographic North Pole). However, Earth's axis of rotation is actually subject to very small \\"wobbles\\" (polar motion), so this definition is not adequate for very precise work. The geographic coordinates of the South Pole are usually given simply as 90¬∞S, since its longitude is geometrically undefined and irrelevant. When a longitude is desired, it may be given as At the South Pole, all directions face north. For this reason, directions at the Pole are given relative to \\"grid north\\", which points northward along the prime meridian.\\"Moving the South Pole\\" , NASA Quest Along tight latitude circles, clockwise is east, and counterclockwise is west, opposite to the North Pole. The Geographic South Pole is presently located on the continent of Antarctica, although this has not been the case for all of Earth's history because of continental drift. It sits atop a featureless, barren, windswept and icy plateau at an altitude of 2,835 metres (9,301 ft) above sea level, and is located about 1,300 km (800 mi) from the nearest open sea at Bay of Whales. The ice is estimated to be about 2,700 metres (9,000 ft) thick at the Pole, so the land surface under the ice sheet is actually near sea level.Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station, National Science Foundation, Office of Polar Programs The polar ice sheet is moving at a rate of roughly 10 metres per year in a direction between 37¬∞ and 40¬∞ west of grid north, down towards the Weddell Sea. Therefore, the position of the station and other artificial features relative to the geographic pole gradually shift over time. Garmin at 90 Deg South - South PoleThe Geographic South Pole is marked by a stake in the ice alongside a small sign; these are repositioned each year in a ceremony on New Year's Day to compensate for the movement of the ice.\\"Marker makes annual move\\", page 6, Antarctic Sun. January 8, 2006; McMurdo Station, Antarctica. The sign records the respective dates that Roald Amundsen and Robert F. Scott reached the Pole, followed by a short quotation from each man, and gives the elevation as \\"9,301 FT.\\". A new marker stake is designed and fabricated each year by staff at the site. =Ceremonial South Pole= The Ceremonial South Pole is an area set aside for photo opportunities at the South Pole Station. It is located some meters from the Geographic South Pole, and consists of a metallic sphere on a short barber pole, surrounded by the flags of the original Antarctic Treaty signatory states. =Historic monuments= Argentinian soldiers saluting the flag after erecting the pole in 1965 Amundsen's Tent The tent was erected by the Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen on its arrival on December 14, 1911. It is currently buried beneath the snow and ice in the vicinity of the Pole. It has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 80), following a proposal by Norway to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. The precise location of the tent is unknown, but based on calculations of the rate of movement of the ice and the accumulation of snow, it is believed, as of 2010, to lie between 1.8 and 2.5 km (1.1 and 1.5 miles) from the Pole at a depth of 17 m (56 ft) below the present surface. Polar Record / Volume 47 / Issue 03 / July 2011 Argentine Flagpole A flagpole erected at the South Geographical Pole in December 1965 by the First Argentine Overland Polar Expedition has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 1) following a proposal by Argentina to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting. Exploration =Pre-1900= In 1820, several expeditions claimed to have been the first to have sighted Antarctica, with the first being the Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev. The first landing was probably just over a year later when American captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice. The basic geography of the Antarctic coastline was not understood until the mid-to-late 19th century. American naval officer Charles Wilkes claimed (correctly) that Antarctica was a new continent, basing the claim on his exploration in 1839‚Äì40, while James Clark Ross, in his expedition of 1839‚Äì1843, hoped that he might be able to sail all the way to the South Pole. (He was unsuccessful.) =1900‚Äì1950= Amundsen, Hanssen, Hassel and Wisting (photo by fifth member Bjaaland). British explorer Robert Falcon Scott on the Discovery Expedition of 1901‚Äì1904 was the first to attempt to find a route from the Antarctic coastline to the South Pole. Scott, accompanied by Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson, set out with the aim of travelling as far south as possible, and on December 31, 1902, reached 82¬∞16‚Ä≤ S. Shackleton later returned to Antarctica as leader of the British Antarctic Expedition (Nimrod Expedition) in a bid to reach the Pole. On 9 January 1909, with three companions, he reached 88¬∞23' S ‚Äì from the Pole ‚Äì before being forced to turn back. The first men to reach the Geographic South Pole were the Norwegian Roald Amundsen and his party on December 14, 1911. Amundsen named his camp Polheim and the entire plateau surrounding the Pole King Haakon VII Vidde in honour of King Haakon VII of Norway. Robert Falcon Scott returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the Terra Nova Expedition, initially unaware of Amundsen's secretive expedition. Scott and four other men reached the South Pole on January 17, 1912, thirty-four days after Amundsen. On the return trip, Scott and his four companions all died of starvation and extreme cold. In 1914 Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the Endurance, was frozen in pack ice and sank 11 months later. The overland journey was never made. US Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd, with the assistance of his first pilot Bernt Balchen, became the first person to fly over the South Pole on November 29, 1929. =1950‚Äìpresent= thumbAmundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station. The ceremonial pole and flags can be seen in the background, slightly to the left of centre, below the tracks behind the buildings. The actual geographic pole is a few more metres to the left. The buildings are raised on stilts to prevent snow build-up. It was not until 31 October 1956 that humans once again set foot at the South Pole, when a party led by Admiral George J. Dufek of the US Navy landed there in an R4D-5L Skytrain (C-47 Skytrain) aircraft. The US Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station was established by air over 1956‚Äì1957 for the International Geophysical Year and has been continuously staffed since then by research and support personnel. After Amundsen and Scott, the next people to reach the South Pole overland (albeit with some air support) were Edmund Hillary (January 4, 1958) and Vivian Fuchs (January 19, 1958) and their respective parties, during the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition. There have been many subsequent expeditions to arrive at the South Pole by surface transportation, including those by Havola, Crary and Fiennes. The first group of women to reach the pole were Pam Young, Jean Pearson, Lois Jones, Eileen McSaveney, Kay Lindsay and Terry Tickhill in 1969. In 1978-79 Michele Eileen Raney became the first woman to winter at the South Pole. Subsequent to the establishment, in 1987, of the logistic support base at Patriot Hills Base Camp, the South Pole became more accessible to non-government expeditions. On December 30, 1989, Arved Fuchs and Reinhold Messner were the first to traverse Antarctica via the South Pole without animal or motorized help, using only skis and the help of wind. Two women, Victoria E. Murden and Shirley Metz reached the pole by land on January 17, 1989. The fastest unsupported journey to the Geographic South Pole from the ocean is 24 days and one hour from Hercules Inlet and was set in 2011 by Norwegian adventurer Christian Eide, who beat the previous solo record set in 2009 by American Todd Carmichael of 39 days and seven hours, and the previous group record also set in 2009 of 33 days and 23 hours. The fastest solo (female), unsupported and unassisted trek to the south pole was performed by Hannah McKeand from the UK in 2006. She made the journey in 39 days 9hrs 33mins. She started on the 19th November 2006 and finished on the 28 December 2006. In the 2011/12 summer, separate expeditions by Norwegian Aleksander Gamme and Australians James Castrission and Justin Jones jointly claimed the first unsupported trek without dogs or kites from the Antarctic coast to the South Pole and back. The two expeditions started from Hercules Inlet a day apart, with Gamme starting first, but completing according to plan the last few kilometres together. As Gamme traveled alone he thus simultaneously became the first to complete the task solo. On 28 December 2018, the first Briton unassisted journey to cross the Antarctic via the south pole was performed by Captain Lou Rudd who became the second person to make the journey in 56 days. On 10 January 2020, Mollie Hughes became the youngest person to ski to the pole, aged 29. Climate and day and night During the southern winter (March‚ÄìSeptember), the South Pole receives no sunlight at all, and from May 11 to August 1, between extended periods of twilight, it is completely dark (apart from moonlight). In the summer (September‚ÄìMarch), the sun is continuously above the horizon and appears to move in a counter-clockwise circle. However, it is always low in the sky, reaching a maximum of 23.5¬∞ in December, thanks to the 23.5¬∞ tilt of the earth's axis. Much of the sunlight that does reach the surface is reflected by the white snow. This lack of warmth from the sun, combined with the high altitude (about ), means that the South Pole has one of the coldest climates on Earth (though it is not quite the coldest; that record goes to the region in the vicinity of the Vostok Station, also in Antarctica, which lies at a higher elevation).Science question of the week, Goddard Space Flight Center. The South Pole is at an altitude of but feels like . Centrifugal force from the spin of the planet pulls the atmosphere toward the equator. The South Pole is colder than the North Pole primarily because of the elevation difference and for being in the middle of a continent. The North Pole is a few feet from sea level in the middle of an ocean. In midsummer, as the sun reaches its maximum elevation of about 23.5 degrees, high temperatures at the South Pole in January average at . As the six-month \\"day\\" wears on and the sun gets lower, temperatures drop as well: they reach around sunset (late March) and sunrise (late September). In midwinter, the average temperature remains steady at around . The highest temperature ever recorded at the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station was on Christmas Day, 2011, and the lowest was on June 23, 1982Your stay at Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station , National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs (for comparison, the lowest temperature directly recorded anywhere on earth was at Vostok Station on July 21, 1983, though was measured indirectly by satellite in East Antarctica between Dome A and Dome F in August 2010\\"NASA-USGS Landsat 8 Satellite Pinpoints Coldest Spots on Earth\\", NASA, December 9, 2013). Mean annual temperature at the South Pole is ‚Äì49.5 ¬∞C (‚Äì57.1 ¬∞F). The South Pole has an ice cap climate (K√∂ppen climate classification EF). It resembles a desert, receiving very little precipitation. Air humidity is near zero. However, high winds can cause the blowing of snowfall, and the accumulation of snow amounts to about 7 cm (2.8 in) per year.Initial environmental evaluation ‚Äì development of blue-ice and compacted-snow runways, National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs, April 9, 1993 The former dome seen in pictures of the Amundsen‚ÄìScott station is partially buried due to snow storms, and the entrance to the dome had to be regularly bulldozed to uncover it. More recent buildings are raised on stilts so that the snow does not build up against their sides. Time In most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the South Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no a priori reason for placing the South Pole in any particular time zone, but as a matter of practical convenience the Amundsen‚ÄìScott South Pole Station keeps New Zealand Time (UTC+12/UTC+13). This is because the US flies its resupply missions (\\"Operation Deep Freeze\\") out of McMurdo Station, which is supplied from Christchurch, New Zealand. Flora and fauna Due to its exceptionally harsh climate, there are no native resident plants or animals at the South Pole. Off-course south polar skuas and snow petrels are occasionally seen there.Mark Sabbatini, \\"Non-human life form seen at Pole\\", The Antarctic Sun, 5 January 2003. In 2000 it was reported that microbes had been detected living in the South Pole ice.\\"Snow microbes found at South Pole\\", BBC News, 10 July 2000 Scientists published in the journal Gondwana Research that evidence had been found of dinosaurs with feathers to protect the animals from the extreme cold. The fossils had been found over 100 years ago in Koonwarra, Australia, but in sediment which had accumulated under a lake which had been near to the South Pole millions of years ago.

According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Native Americans told early settlers not to build big houses close to the river because of the \\"big water.\\" In 1872, Dr. John McPherson moved from his Brownville, Nebraska home to the river valley. McPherson opened several stores and laid out lots in a town he called Republican. Once a post office was built, the town took the official name of Republican City. The Burlington Railroad reached the town in 1881, creating a booming trade center. On May 31, 1935 a storm dumped of rain on the Republican River watershed, which averaged nine inches (229 mm) annually. The flood wiped out Republican City within minutes, and 100 people lost their lives. Nearly 10,000 cattle were reportedly lost along the Republican River Valley along with 300 county bridges and over of roads and railway. The flood was responsible for over $26 million in damages. The town moved to avoid further damage, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers researched a potential location for the dam would work the best to prevent such flood loss. They chose an area between Republican City and Naponee. Republican City was rebuilt two miles (3 km) north on higher ground in 1952, with a few original buildings. Some of the original buildings' foundations are visible when the water level is low.  Geography  { style=\\"float:right;\\" The route of the Republican River } With a surface covering , the Harlan County Reservoir lake sits in bottom lands of the Republican River Valley. Located seven miles (11 km) from the Nebraska/Kansas border, the lake is nine miles (14 km) long and has about of shore line. The Reservoir's dam sits on the Republican River two miles (3 km) south of Republican City. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the river valley got its name from the Republican Pawnee Indian tribe who inhabited the area. The land consists of thick trees and brush as most river bottoms do. Harlan County Reservoir is Nebraska‚Äôs second largest lake.  Ecology  The lake is under the management of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps also manages surrounding the lake as well as the Republican River near the lake. Corps staff conduct safety inspections on the dam, working directly with the Kansas District Water Management to determine how much water is released from the reservoir into the Republican River. Corps Staff are also responsible for the upkeeps of the roads, utility systems, campsites, beaches, boat ramps, and picnic areas in and around the lake. The Corps also works directly with Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to manage the natural resources of Harlan County Lake. = Fish = The Harlan County Lake has fish species such as walleye, white bass, wipers, catfish, crappie and pike. Ice fishing is popular on the reservoir as well. = Birds = According to the Nebraska Birding Trails website, birds found at Harlan County Reservoir have included common loon, black-legged kittiwake, parasitic jaeger, little blue heron, white-faced ibis, and Sabine's gull. Bald eagles are also often spotted in the latter fall and winter months, especially at the Western end of the lake near Alma. Many migratory birds rely on Harlan county Reservoir each year as they pass through. With an abundance of water in the lake and river, and the thousands of acres of green wheat and corn stalks, this area is crucial as the thousands of ducks and geese fly south to their mating grounds. = Mammals = The shoreline and rivers surrounding the reservoir sustain many mammal species. Beaver and muskrat use the muddy banks of the small creeks and streams in and out of the lake as habitat. This is a prime area for such creatures needing the smaller willows and trees to make their dams and huts. The thick brush of the river bottom ground is some of the state‚Äôs best whitetail deer hunting habitat. Field mice, moles, ground squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, opossum, skunk, badger, coyote, bobcat and many more rely on the habitat supported by the lake for their survival. = Plants = The main habitat of the Harlan County Lake area is mixed prairie grasses. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers these prairies consist of Big and Little Bluestem, Indian grass, western wheatgrass, buffalo grass, blue gramma and switch grass. Much of the area is covered by trees and brush as well. A strand of Cottonwood, ash, cedar, and maple trees just to name a few are found all along the Republican River and other lowland inlets leading up to the lake. The plants of any ecosystem make up most of the habitat.  Land maintenance  A current issue at Harlan County Lake has been a problem of invasive feral hogs destroying a lot of farmland and wildlife habitat while also increasing the chance of introducing disease to other wildlife and domestic hogs in the area. In February 2008 the Nebraska Game and Parks and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers exterminated 69 feral hogs from the Harlan County Lake area. They were shot from a helicopter by a professional sharpshooter from the Kansas Wildlife Services. A large amount of native prairie and woodland have been converted back over the years in the area. Over 300,000 trees have been planted and of native prairie have been planted using funds from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission Habitat Stamp Program.

Overview Through a global database and analysis, the RULAC Project has as its aim an assessment of the implementation by states of the law applicable in armed conflicts: *international humanitarian law *international human rights law *international criminal law *refugee law The project will ultimately cover all member states of the United Nations and parties to the Geneva Conventions as well as contested territories, whether they are in situation of armed conflict or not. Indeed, certain international rules must be implemented during peacetime or are relevant in post-conflict situations, in particular those relating to the repression of international crimes. In addition, the rules regarding the fight against terrorism, also to be covered by the website, are applicable to states that are not necessarily in a situation of armed conflict. The website is divided into three parts. The homepage offers a small description of the applicable law and addresses the main legal issues in that area, for example the legal qualification of conflicts or the applicability of international law to non-state armed groups. The website then offers for each country the relevant texts and documents dealing with the national and international legal framework (national legislation and case law, resolutions of intergovernmental organizations, treaty, etc.). Finally, the website offers a legal analysis that, on one hand, qualifies the conflict under international humanitarian law and on the other hand, determines the applicable law. This part of the website, certainly the most delicate in juridical and political terms, is particular to the RULAC Project. The RULAC Project should prove to be a precious source of information for government officials, journalists and more widely for any person interested by the respect of the law in war. Geneva Conventions The first three Geneva Conventions were revised, expanded, and replaced, and the fourth one was added, in 1949. * The Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field was adopted in 1864. It was significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version, the 1929 version, and later the First Geneva Convention of 1949.1949 Geneva Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field * The Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea was adopted in 1906. It was significantly revised and replaced by the Second Geneva Convention of 1949. * The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War was adopted in 1929. It was significantly revised and replaced by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949. * The Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War was adopted in 1949. In addition, there are three additional amendment protocols to the Geneva Convention: * Protocol I (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 167 countries. * Protocol II (1977): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts. As of 12 January 2007 it had been ratified by 163 countries. * Protocol III (2005): Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem.

Historically part of Cumberland, it is near the A5086 road and is 2.5 miles (4 km) southwest of Cockermouth. It is located just outside the Lake District National Park. In 1931 the parish had a population of 233. Etymology Eaglesfield lay in the early Middle Ages within the British kingdom of Rheged, and the first element of the name is perhaps derived from the Brythonic 'eccles' \\"church\\" (cognate with Welsh 'eglwys' 'church'). The meaning would be 'open land near a British church' - something that the Anglian settlers would have seen as they \\"arrived and settled some two miles away down below at Brigham.\\" (The second element, 'Feld', is Old English for 'open country'). Alternatively, it means 'Ecgel's open land' ('Ecgel's feld'). 'Ecgel' is a personal name and possibly \\"a normal diminutive of compound names such as 'Ecglaf', or Ecgwulf' \\". Governance Eaglesfield is in the parliamentary constituency of Copeland, Trudy Harrison is the Member of Parliament. Before Brexit, it was in the North West England European Parliamentary Constituency. For Local Government purposes it is in the Dalton Ward of Allerdale Borough Council and part of the Cockermouth South Ward of Cumbria County Council. Eaglesfield does not have its own parish council, instead it is part of Dean Parish Council, which also covers villages of Dean, Deanscales, Branthwaite, Pardshaw and Ullock. Eaglesfield was a township in Brigham parish. From 1866 Eaglesfield was a civil parish in its own right until it was merged with Dean on 1 April 1934. Notable people Eaglesfield was the birthplace of John Dalton (1766‚Äì1844), acclaimed chemist, meteorologist and physicist. He was the father of the modern atomic theory. Eaglesfield was the probable birthplace of Robert de Eglesfield (c.1295‚Äì1349), founder of the Queen's College, Oxford. His father, John of Eglesfield, held lands in and near there. Moorland Close, Eaglesfield, was the birthplace of Fletcher Christian, master's mate aboard . He led the mutiny against the captain, William Bligh, during their voyage to Tahiti.

Harbottle & Lewis has 42 partners and 68 lawyers and in 2016/17 recorded turnover of ¬£28.1m.Matt Byrne, The Lawyer, 16 August 2010, Harbottle & Lewis It is recommended by the independent legal directories The Legal 500 and Chambers and Partners in all its core practice areas.  History  Laurence Harbottle and Brian Lewis met at Law School in Guildford in 1951. Both lawyers had a special interest in the legal aspects of film production and theatre and in December 1955 established Harbottle & Lewis with its office in South Molton Street, Mayfair. While Brian Lewis concentrated on film guarantees and film productions, Laurence Harbottle mainly acted for film producers as well as writers, actors and technicians. With advances in technology, their firm grew and developed its television and music industry expertise. More recently Harbottle & Lewis has also built specialist practice areas in electronic commerce and interactive entertainment. The firm moved from South Molton Street to its current location on Hanover Square in May 1988. Laurence Harbottle served as solicitor to friends Laurence Olivier and Dirk Bogarde. The firm's clients presently include The Prince of Wales, and subsequently his sons The Duke of Cambridge and The Duke of Sussex. Relations with News International In 2006 Harbottle & Lewis acted on behalf of Prince Charles in engaging with the Metropolitan Police's investigations with regards to the hacking of the phones of his sons, Princes William and Harry, in the News of the World royal phone hacking scandal. That scandal subsequently led to the dismissal of News of the World reporter Clive Goodman. When Goodman sued for unfair dismissal, Harbottle & Lewis were hired by the News of the World's parent company, News International. On 10 July 2011, Harbottle & Lewis acting for their client News International were cited by BBC News Business editor Robert Peston as being involved in the 'smoking gun' emails in the News of the World phone hacking scandal.Robert Peston, BBC, 10 July 2011, News International found \\"smoking gun\\" emails in 2007 On 18 July 2011, the firm issued an open letter outlining its position,Legal Week, 18 July 2011, Harbottle defends Hackgate position; Grabiner to lead News Corp clean-up and appointed Luther Pendragon to handle PR issues relating to the affair.

Terminology  Mainland Australia showing the continental Sahul Shelf (light blue) extending to the islands of New Guinea in the north, the island of Timor in the northwest, and Tasmania in the south The continent of Australia is sometimes known by the names Sahul, Australinea, or Meganesia to distinguish it from the country of Australia, and consists of the landmasses which sit on Australia's continental plate. This includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, and the island of New Guinea, which comprises Papua New Guinea and Western New Guinea (a province of Indonesia). The name \\"Sahul\\" takes its name from the Sahul Shelf, which is part of the continental shelf of the Australian continent. The term Oceania, originally a \\"great division\\" of the world, was replaced by the concept of Australia as a continent in the 1950s.: \\"...the 1950s... was also the period when... Oceania as a \\"great division\\" was replaced by Australia as a continent along with a series of isolated and continentally attached islands. [Footnote 78: When Southeast Asia was conceptualized as a world region during World War II..., Indonesia and the Philippines were perforce added to Asia, which reduced the extent of Oceania, leading to a reconceptualization of Australia as a continent in its own right. This maneuver is apparent in postwar atlases]\\" Today, the term Oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the Australian continent, Zealandia and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model. Archaeological terminology for this region has changed repeatedly. Before the 1970s, the single Pleistocene landmass was called Australasia, derived from the Latin , meaning \\"southern\\", although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands like New Zealand that are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, the term Greater Australia was introduced for the Pleistocene continent. Then at a 1975 conference and consequent publication, the name Sahul was extended from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent. In 1984 W. Filewood suggested the name Meganesia, meaning \\"great island\\" or \\"great island-group\\", for both the Pleistocene continent and the present-day lands, and this name has been widely accepted by biologists.e.g. Others have used Meganesia with different meanings: travel writer Paul Theroux included New Zealand in his definition and others have used it for Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. Another biologist, Richard Dawkins, coined the name Australinea in 2004. Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea has also been used.e.g. Geology and geography Sahul continent Situated in the geographical region of Oceania, Australia is the smallest continent in land area. The continent includes a continental shelf overlain by shallow seas which divide it into several landmasses‚Äîthe Arafura Sea and Torres Strait between mainland Australia and New Guinea, and Bass Strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania. When sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene ice age, including the Last Glacial Maximum about 18,000 BC, they were connected by dry land. During the past 18,000 to 10,000 years, rising sea levels overflowed the lowlands and separated the continent into today's low-lying arid to semi-arid mainland and the two mountainous islands of New Guinea and Tasmania. With a total land area of , the Australian continent is the smallest, and second-lowest human inhabited (after Antarctica) continent on Earth. The continental shelf connecting the islands, half of which is less than deep, covers some , including the Sahul Shelf and Bass Strait. As the country of Australia is mostly on a single landmass, and comprises most of the continent, it is sometimes informally referred to as an island continent, surrounded by oceans. Geological forces such as tectonic uplift of mountain ranges or clashes between tectonic plates occurred mainly in Australia's early history, when it was still a part of Gondwana. Australia is situated in the middle of the tectonic plate, and therefore currently has no active volcanism. Sea level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum. The continent primarily sits on the Indo-Australian Plate. Because of its central location on its tectonic plate Australia doesn't have any active volcanic regions, the only continent with this distinction. The lands were joined with Antarctica as part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana until the plate began to drift north about 96 million years ago. For most of the time since then, Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea remained a continuous landmass. When the last glacial period ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the Australian mainland. A northern arc consisting of the New Guinea Highlands, the Raja Ampat Islands, and Halmahera was uplifted by the northward migration of Australia and subduction of the Pacific Plate. The Outer Banda Arc was accreted along the northwestern edge the continent; it includes the islands of Timor, Tanimbar, and Seram. Papua New Guinea has several volcanoes, as it is situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Volcanic eruptions are not rare, and the area is prone to earthquakes and tsunamis because of this. Mount Wilhelm in Papua New Guinea is the second highest mountain in the continent, and at above sea level, Puncak Jaya is the highest mountain. The Australian continent, being part of the Indo-Australian Plate (more specifically, the Australian Plate), is the lowest, flattest, and oldest landmass on EarthPain, C.F., Villans, B.J., Roach, I.C., Worrall, L. & Wilford, J.R.

Human history  The Australian continent and Sunda were points of early human migrations after leaving Africa. Recent research points to a planned migration of hundreds of people using bamboo rafts, which eventually landed on Sahul. =Indigenous peoples= Aboriginal pictographs known as Wandjina in the Wunnumurra Gorge, Barnett River, Kimberley, Western Australia Indigenous Australians, that is Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander people, are the original inhabitants of the Australian continent and nearby islands. They migrated from Africa to Asia around 70,000 years ago and arrived in Australia at least 50,000 years ago, based on archaeological evidence. More recent research points to earlier arrival, possibly 65,000 years ago. They are believed to be among the earliest human migrations out of Africa. There is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between Australians in the far north and the Austronesian peoples of modern-day New Guinea and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage.Jared Diamond. (1997). Guns, Germs, and Steel. Random House. London. pp 314‚Äì316 The earliest known human remains were found at Lake Mungo, a dry lake in the southwest of New South Wales. Remains found at Mungo suggest one of the world's oldest known cremations, thus indicating early evidence for religious ritual among humans. Dreamtime remains a prominent feature of Australian Aboriginal art, the oldest continuing tradition of art in the world. Papuan habitation is estimated to have begun between 42,000 and 48,000 years ago in New Guinea. Trade between New Guinea and neighboring Indonesian islands was documented as early as the seventh century, and archipelagic rule of New Guinea by the 13th. At the beginning of the seventh century, the Sumatra-based empire of Srivijaya (7th century‚Äì13th century) engaged in trade relations with western New Guinea, initially taking items like sandalwood and birds-of-paradise in tribute to China, but later making slaves out of the natives. The rule of the Java-based empire of Majapahit (1293‚Äì1527) extended to the western fringes of New Guinea. Recent archaeological research suggests that 50,000 years ago people may have occupied sites in the highlands at New Guinean altitudes of up to , rather than being restricted to warmer coastal areas. =Pre-colonial history= Terra Australis, as it appears on a map by Rumold Mercator, 1587 Legends of Terra Australis Incognita‚Äîan \\"unknown land of the South\\"‚Äîdate back to Roman times and before, and were commonplace in medieval geography, although not based on any documented knowledge of the continent.Albert-Marie-Ferdinand Anthiaume, \\"Un pilote et cartographe havrais au XVIe si√®cle: Guillaume Le Testu\\", Bulletin de G√©ographie Historique et Descriptive, Paris, Nos 1‚Äì2, 1911, pp. 135‚Äì202, n.b. p. 176. Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle speculated of a large landmass in the southern hemisphere, saying, \\"Now since there must be a region bearing the same relation to the southern pole as the place we live in bears to our pole...\\".Meteorologica Book II 5 His ideas were later expanded by Ptolemy (2nd century AD), who believed that the lands of the Northern Hemisphere should be balanced by land in the south. The theory of balancing land has been documented as early as the 5th century on maps by Macrobius, who uses the term Australis on his maps. Terra Australis, a hypothetical continent first posited in antiquity, appeared on maps between the 15th and 18th centuries.John Noble Wilford: The Mapmakers, the Story of the Great Pioneers in Cartography from Antiquity to Space Age, p. 139, Vintage Books, Random House 1982, Scientists, such as Gerardus Mercator (1569) and Alexander Dalrymple as late as 1767 argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the south as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere.Carlos Pedro Vairo, TERRA AUSTRALIS Historical Charts of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica. Ed. Zagier & Urruty Publicationa, 2010. The cartographic depictions of the southern continent in the 16th and early 17th centuries, as might be expected for a concept based on such abundant conjecture and minimal data, varied wildly from map to map; in general, the continent shrank as potential locations were reinterpreted. At its largest, the continent included Tierra del Fuego, separated from South America by a small strait; New Guinea; and what would come to be called Australia.Spieghel der Australische Navigatie; cited by A.

Zuiderbaan (1979) Dutch Discoveries of Australia.Rigby Ltd, Australia. pp. 19‚Äì30 Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman circumnavigated and landed on parts of the Australian continental coast and discovered Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), New Zealand in 1642, and Fiji islands. He was the first known European explorer to reach these islands. In the quest for Terra Australis, Spanish explorations in the 17th century, such as the expedition led by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queir√≥s, discovered the Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos, and sailed the Torres Strait between Australia and New Guinea, named after navigator Lu√≠s Vaz de Torres, who was the first European to explore the Strait. When Europeans first arrived, inhabitants of New Guinea and nearby islands, whose technologies included bone, wood, and stone tools, had a productive agricultural system. In 1660, the Dutch recognised the Sultan of Tidore's sovereignty over New Guinea. The first known Europeans to sight New Guinea were probably the Portuguese and Spanish navigators sailing in the South Pacific in the early part of the 16th century. On 23 April 1770 British explorer James Cook made his first recorded direct observation of indigenous Australians at Brush Island near Bawley Point. On 29 April, Cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the Kurnell Peninsula. It is here that James Cook made first contact with an Aboriginal tribe known as the Gweagal, who he fired upon, injuring one.http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700429.html His expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered the eastern coastline of Australia. Captain Arthur Phillip led the First Fleet of 11 ships and about 850 convicts into Sydney on 26 January 1788. This was to be the location for the new colony. Phillip described Sydney Cove as being \\"without exception the finest harbour in the world\\". =Modern history= In 1883, the Colony of Queensland tried to annex the southern half of eastern New Guinea, but the British government did not approve.John Waiko. Short History of Papua New Guinea' (1993) The Commonwealth of Australia came into being when the Federal Constitution was proclaimed by the Governor-General, Lord Hopetoun, on 1 January 1901. From that point a system of federalism in Australia came into operation, entailing the establishment of an entirely new national government (the Commonwealth government) and an ongoing division of powers between that government and the States. With the encouragement of Queensland, in 1884, a British protectorate had been proclaimed over the southern coast of New Guinea and its adjacent islands. British New Guinea was annexed outright in 1888. The possession was placed under the authority of the newly federated Commonwealth of Australia in 1902 and with passage of the Papua Act of 1905, British New Guinea became the Australian Territory of Papua, with formal Australian administration beginning in 1906. An Australian light machine gun team in action near Wewak, Papua New Guinea, in June 1945 The bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942 was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. In an effort to isolate Australia, the Japanese planned a seaborne invasion of Port Moresby, in the Australian Territory of New Guinea. Between July and November 1942, Australian forces repulsed Japanese attempts on the city by way of the Kokoda Track, in the highlands of New Guinea. The Battle of Buna‚ÄìGona, between November 1942 and January 1943, set the tone for the bitter final stages of the New Guinea campaign, which persisted into 1945. The offensives in Papua and New Guinea of 1943‚Äì44 were the single largest series of connected operations ever mounted by the Australian armed forces. Following the 1998 commencement of reforms across Indonesia, Papua and other Indonesian provinces received greater regional autonomy. In 2001, \\"Special Autonomy\\" status was granted to Papua province, although to date, implementation has been partial and often criticized.U.S. Dept. of Defence; International Crisis Group; and International Crisis Group . Archived 19 August 2014. The region was administered as a single province until 2003, when it was split into the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Elections in 1972 resulted in the formation of a ministry headed by Chief Minister Michael Somare, who pledged to lead the country to self-government and then to independence. Papua New Guinea became self-governing on 1 December 1973 and achieved independence on 16 September 1975. The country joined the United Nations (UN) on 10 October 1975. Migration brought large numbers of southern and central Europeans to Australia for the first time. A 1958 government leaflet assured readers that unskilled non- British migrants were needed for \\"labour on rugged projects ...work which is not generally acceptable to Australians or British workers\\".cited in Michael Dugan and Josef Swarc (1984) p. 139 Australia fought on the side of Britain in the two world wars and became a long-standing ally of the United States when threatened by Imperial Japan during World War II. Trade with Asia increased and a post-war immigration program received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. Supported by immigration of people from more than 200 countries since the end of World War II, the population increased to more than 23 million by 2014. Ecology =Flora= regeneration. Baliem Valley in the New Guinea Highlands For about 40 million years Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea was almost completely isolated. During this time, the continent experienced numerous changes in climate, but the overall trend was towards greater aridity. When South America eventually separated from Antarctica, the development of the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current changed weather patterns across the world. For Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea, it brought a marked intensification of the drying trend. The great inland seas and lakes dried out. Much of the long-established broad-leaf deciduous forest began to give way to the distinctive hard-leaved sclerophyllous plants that characterise the modern Australian landscape. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the conifers Podocarpus (eastern Australia and New Guinea), the rainforest emergents Araucaria (eastern Australia and New Guinea), Nothofagus (New Guinea and Tasmania) and Agathis (northern Queensland and New Guinea), as well as tree ferns and several species of Eucalyptus. Prominent features of the Australian flora are adaptations to aridity and fire which include scleromorphy and serotiny. These adaptations are common in species from the large and well-known families Proteaceae (Banksia), Myrtaceae (Eucalyptus or gum trees, Melaleucas and Callistemons), Fabaceae (Acacias or wattles and Casuarina or she-oaks) and Grevilleas, which are typically found in the Australian mainland. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many tropical rainforest species with origins in Asia, such as Castanopsis acuminatissima, Lithocarpus spp., elaeocarps, and laurels, together with typically Australasian flora. In the New Guinean highlands, conifers such as Dacrycarpus, Dacrydium, Papuacedrus and Libocedrus are present. For many species, the primary refuge was the relatively cool and well-watered Great Dividing Range. Even today, pockets of remnant vegetation remain in the cool uplands, some species not much changed from the Gondwanan forms of 60 or 90 million years ago. Eventually, the Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea tectonic plate collided with the Eurasian plate to the north. The collision caused the northern part of the continent to buckle upwards, forming the high and rugged mountains of New Guinea and, by reverse (downwards) buckling, the Torres Strait that now separates the two main landmasses. The collision also pushed up the islands of Wallacea, which served as island 'stepping-stones' that allowed plants from Southeast Asia's rainforests to colonise New Guinea, and some plants from Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea to move into Southeast Asia. The ocean straits between the islands were narrow enough to allow plant dispersal, but served as an effective barrier to exchange of land mammals between Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea and Asia. Among the fungi, the remarkable association between Cyttaria gunnii (one of the \\"golf-ball\\" fungi) and its associated trees in the genus Nothofagus is evidence of that drift: the only other places where this association is known are New Zealand and southern Argentina and Chile. =Fauna= The king bird-of-paradise is one of over 300 bird species in West Papua. Due to the spread of animals, fungi and plants across the single Pleistocene landmass the separate lands have a related biota. There are over 300 bird species in West Papua, of which at least 20 are unique to the ecoregion, and some live only in very restricted areas. These include the grey-banded munia, Vogelkop bowerbird, and the king bird-of-paradise.WWF: Bird wonders of New Guinea's western-most province, retrieved 11 May 2010 Australia has a huge variety of animals; some 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 24% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians that inhabit the continent are endemic to Australia.Williams, J. et al. 2001. Biodiversity, Australia State of the Environment Report 2001 (Theme Report), CSIRO Publishing on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Heritage, Canberra. This high level of endemism can be attributed to the continent's long geographic isolation, tectonic stability, and the effects of an unusual pattern of climate change on the soil and flora over geological time. Australia and its territories are home to around 800 species of bird;Egerton, p. 122. 45% of these are endemic to Australia. Predominant bird species in Australia include the Australian magpie, Australian raven, the pied currawong, crested pigeons and the laughing kookaburra.Egerton, L. ed. 2005. Encyclopedia of Australian wildlife. Reader's Digest The koala, emu, platypus and kangaroo are national animals of Australia, and the Tasmanian devil is also one of the well-known animals in the country. The goanna is a predatory lizard native to the Australian mainland.Underhill D (1993) Australia's Dangerous Creatures, Reader's Digest, Sydney, New South Wales, Natural history illustrator John Gould popularised the koala with his 1863 work The Mammals of Australia. As the continent drifted north from Antarctica, a unique fauna, flora and mycobiota developed. Marsupials and monotremes also existed on other continents, but only in Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea did they out-compete the placental mammals and come to dominate. New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, rodents and bats; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral‚Äîthe latter equal to 75 percent of the world's known total. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. Bird life also flourished ‚Äì in particular, the songbirds (order Passeriformes, suborder Passeri) are thought to have evolved 50 million years ago in the part of Gondwana that later became Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and Antarctica, before radiating into a great number of different forms and then spreading around the globe. Animal groups such as macropods, monotremes, and cassowaries are endemic to Australia. There were three main reasons for the enormous diversity that developed in animal, fungal and plant life. * While much of the rest of the world underwent significant cooling and thus loss of species diversity, Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea was drifting north at such a pace that the overall global cooling effect was roughly equalled by its gradual movement toward the equator. Temperatures in Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea, in other words, remained reasonably constant for a very long time, and a vast number of different animal, fungal and plant species were able to evolve to fit particular ecological niches. * Because the continent was more isolated than any other, very few outside species arrived to colonise, and unique native forms developed unimpeded. * Finally, despite the fact that the continent was already very old and thus relatively infertile, there are dispersed areas of high fertility. Where other continents had volcanic activity and/or massive glaciation events to turn over fresh, unleached rocks rich in minerals, the rocks and soils of Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea were left largely untouched except by gradual erosion and deep weathering. In general, fertile soils produce a profusion of life, and a relatively large number of species/level of biodiversity. This is because where nutrients are plentiful, competition is largely a matter of outcompeting rival species, leaving great scope for innovative co-evolution as is witnessed in tropical, fertile ecosystems. In contrast, infertile soils tend to induce competition on an abiotic basis meaning individuals all face constant environmental pressures, leaving less scope for divergent evolution, a process instrumental in creating new species. Although New Guinea is the most northerly part of the continent, and could be expected to be the most tropical in climate, the altitude of the New Guinea highlands is such that a great many animals and plants that were once common across Australia‚ÄìNew Guinea now survive only in the tropical highlands where they are severely threatened by overpopulation pressures. Climate In New Guinea, the climate is mostly monsoonal (December to March), southeast monsoon (May to October), and tropical rainforest with slight seasonal temperature variation. In lower altitudes, the temperature is around 80 ¬∞F (27 ¬∞C) year round. But the higher altitudes, such as Mendi, are constantly around 70 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C) with cool lows nearing 52 ¬∞F (11 ¬∞C), with abundant rainfall and high humidity. The New Guinea Highlands are one of the few regions close to the equator that experience snowfall, which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland. Some areas in the island experience an extraordinary amount of precipitation, averaging roughly of rainfall annually. The Australian landmass's climate is mostly desert or semi-arid, with the southern coastal corners having a temperate climate, such as oceanic and humid subtropical climate in the east coast and Mediterranean climate in the west. The northern parts of the country have a tropical climate. Snow falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast, in the states of Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and in the Australian Capital Territory. Temperatures in Australia have ranged from above to well below . Nonetheless, minimum temperatures are moderated. The El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation is associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world. Australia is one of the continents most affected and experiences extensive droughts alongside considerable wet periods. Demography =Religion= Migrants to Australia disembarking from a ship, ca. 1885 Christianity is the predominant religion in the continent, although large proportions of Australians belong to no religion.Christianity in its Global Context, 1970‚Äì2020 Society, Religion, and Mission, Center for the Study of Global Christianity Other religions in the region include Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism, which are prominent minority religions in Australia. Traditional religions are often animist, found in New Guinea. Islam is prevalent in the Indonesian New Guinea. Many Papuans combine their Christian faith with traditional indigenous beliefs and practices. =Languages= \\"Aboriginal Australian languages\\", including the large Pama‚ÄìNyungan family, \\"Papuan languages\\" of New Guinea and neighbouring islands, including the large Trans‚ÄìNew Guinea family, and \\"Tasmanian languages\\" are generic terms for the native languages of the continent other than those of Austronesian family. Predominant languages include English in Australia, Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea, and Indonesian (Malay) in Indonesian New Guinea. Immigration to Australia have brought overseas languages such as Italian, Greek, Arabic, Filipino, Mandarin, Vietnamese and Spanish, among others. Contact between Austronesian and Papuan resulted in several instances in mixed languages such as Maisin. Tok Pisin is an English creole language spoken in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea has more languages than any other country, with over 820 indigenous languages, representing 12% of the world's total, but most have fewer than 1,000 speakers.Papua New Guinea, Ethnologue =Immigration= Since 1945, more than 7 million people have settled in Australia. From the late 1970s, there was a significant increase in immigration from Asian and other non-European countries, making Australia a multicultural country. Sydney is the most multicultural city in Oceania, having more than 250 different languages spoken with about 40 percent of residents speaking a language other than English at home. Furthermore, 36 percent of the population reported having been born overseas, with top countries being Italy, Lebanon, Vietnam and Iraq, among others. Melbourne is also fairly multicultural, having the largest Greek-speaking population outside of Europe,http://www.oecd.org/gov/regional-policy/50242959.pdf and the second largest Asian population in Australia after Sydney.

Asian Development Bank (March 2015) Politics Government House, Canberra is the official residence of the Governor-General. Australia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy with Elizabeth II at its apex as the Queen of Australia, a role that is distinct from her position as monarch of the other Commonwealth realms. The Queen is represented in Australia by the Governor-General at the federal level and by the Governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of her ministers. There are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party. Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left. Papua New Guinea is a Commonwealth realm. As such, Queen Elizabeth II is its sovereign and head of state. The constitutional convention, which prepared the draft constitution, and Australia, the outgoing metropolitan power, had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy. The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet. The monarch is represented by the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea, currently Bob Dadae. Papua New Guinea (along with the Solomon Islands) is unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors- general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.

The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture.Teo and White, pp. 125‚Äì27. Since the mid-20th century, American popular culture has strongly influenced Australia, particularly through television and cinema.Teo and White, pp. 121‚Äì23. Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries, and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations.Jupp, pp. 808‚Äì12, 74‚Äì77.

Kurulu Village War Chief at Baliem Valley in New Guinea. It is estimated that more than 7000 different cultural groups exist in Papua New Guinea, and most groups have their own language. Because of this diversity, in which they take pride, many different styles of cultural expression have emerged; each group has created its own expressive forms in art, performance art, weaponry, costumes and architecture. Papua New Guinea is one of the few cultures in Oceania to practice the tradition of bride price. In particular, Papua New Guinea is world-famous for carved wooden sculpture: masks, canoes, story-boards. Australia has a tradition of Aboriginal art which is thousands of years old, the best known forms being rock art and bark painting. Evidence of Aboriginal art in Australia can be traced back at least 30,000 years. Examples of ancient Aboriginal rock artworks can be found throughout the continent ‚Äì notably in national parks such as those of the UNESCO listed sites at Uluru and Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory, but also within protected parks in urban areas such as at Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in Sydney. Aboriginal culture includes a number of practices and ceremonies centered on a belief in the Dreamtime. Reverence for the land and oral traditions are emphasized. =Sport= Papua New Guinea's national team at the 2008 International Cup (Australian rules football) in Melbourne Popular sports in Papua New Guinea include various codes of football (rugby league, rugby union, soccer, and Australian rules football), cricket, volleyball, softball, netball, and basketball. Other Olympic sports are also gaining popularity, such as boxing and weightlifting. Rugby league is the most popular sport in Papua New Guinea (especially in the highlands), which also unofficially holds the title as the national sport. The most popular sport in Australia is cricket, the most popular sport among Australian women is netball, while Australian rules football is the most popular sport in terms of spectatorship and television ratings.Australia (Countries & Cultures), Tracey Boraas, Capstone Press (2002), Page 54 Planet Sport, Kath Woodward, 2012 p. 85 Australia (Cultures of the World), Vijeya Rajendra, Sundran Rajendra, 2002, p. 101 Australia has hosted two Summer Olympic Games: Melbourne 1956 and Sydney 2000.

It is now the site of a parador. History The castle began as a Moorish fortress in the 8th century, later improved by the Nasrid ruler of the Emirate of Granada, Abdallah ibn al-Ahmar (who also built the Alhambra). Earlier, where the parador now stands, there was a tower known as Hannibal's Tower, of which some traces remain. After King Ferdinand III of Castile captured the city in 1246 after the Siege of Ja√©n, he commenced a transformation of the castle, including construction of what became known as the New Castle on the eastern extreme of the hill. The bulk of the work, however, took place under the reigns of Alfonso X and Ferdinand IV. There are five towers and a donjon, with one of the towers holding the Chapel of Saint Catalina. One of the last structures built during this period was the donjon, which was the work of the Conestable of Castile, Miguel Lucas de Iranzo. The builders of the new castle used some of the towers and ramparts of the old fortress, and destroyed or replaced others. The construction in 1965 of the parador resulted in destruction of many of the elements of the Old Castle. The few remnants of the original fortress occupy the western extreme of the hill. The 17th century saw some interior remodeling of the buildings. Then in the early 19th century, Napoleonic forces built a gunpowder store, stables, hospital, offices, kitchen, and artillery platform. Little beyond the foundations remains of most of these. On the top of the hill there is a monumental cross that recalls the cross that Ferdinand III had erected there. At the foot of the cross, engraved in the rock, is the \\"Sonnet to the Cross\\" by the poet Almendros Aguilar. The castle and parador have a view over the valley of the Guadalquivir to the ridges of the Sierra Morena. General Charles de Gaulle stayed in the parador while writing his memoirs.

Personal life Mascarenhas was born in Goa, but his early education was in Pune and later at the St. Xavier's College, Mumbai. He is married to Dr. Jolly Mascarenhas. He has four children. He had taken a vow that he would marry only after Liberation of Goa from the colonial Portuguese rule. Hence, he married on 29 December 1961, exactly ten days after Goa's liberation on 19 December 1961.

Journalism He started his career as a journalist in the Morning Standard at Mumbai. He worked as a sub-editor at the Bombay Sentinel, under editor B. G. Horniman. Mascarenhas later joined the Onlooker as an assistant-editor. He later edited the Goan Tribune, which espoused the cause of Goa's liberation. Upon his return to liberated Goa in 1961, he joined as the editor of The Navhind Times and later established and edited Goa Today. Contribution to the independence movement Lambert Mascarenhas also contributed to India's freedom movement. He authored the Goan Tribune, which was dedicated to the cause of Goa's liberation. While at the Goan Tribune, he wrote numerous articles against the Portuguese colonial regime in Goa and caught the attention of both Indian leaders as well as the Portuguese regime. While on a visit to Goa, he was arrested and jailed by the Portuguese for his articles. He was later released on bail and expelled from Goa. Books He has authored several books, including Sorrowing Lies My Land, published in 1955. It recalls the Rammanohar Lohia-led anti-colonial movement launched in Margao in 1946. It was characterised by Ben Antao thus: > The novel covers the time span from roughly 1910 to about 1950. It is a > political novel whose message is that the people of Goa under the Portuguese > rule were denied basic civil rights such as freedom of speech and assembly, > and those who protested were quickly punished or imprisoned. The limitations > of the first person narrative, especially from the point of view of a young > boy, dilute the dramatic impact of the action in the second half. Although > the reader is aware that it is the author speaking in the guise of the boy, > the conflict is rendered less acute nonetheless. His other works include The First City , In The Womb of Saudade, The Greater Tragedy and Heartbreak Passage. Awards Lambert has been awarded the Laxmidas Borkar Memorial Award for journalism for 2004. He has also been awarded Goa's highest civilian award, the Gomant Vibhushan.

A general delineation of the Antarctic Convergence, sometimes used by scientists as the demarcation of the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60¬∞ S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the second-smallest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This oceanic zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters. By way of his voyages in the 1770s, James Cook proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as various parts of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation.The Southern Ocean is the Fifth and Newest World Ocean This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally- fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.Pyne, Stephen J.; The Ice: A Journey to Antarctica. University of Washington Press, 1986. The maximum depth of the Southern Ocean, using the definition that it lies south of 60th parallel, was surveyed by the Five Deeps Expedition in early February 2019. The expedition's multibeam sonar team identified the deepest point at 60¬∞ 28' 46\\"S, 025¬∞ 32' 32\\"W, with a depth of . The expedition leader and chief submersible pilot Victor Vescovo, has proposed naming this deepest point in the Southern Ocean the \\"Factorian Deep\\", based on the name of the manned submersible DSV Limiting Factor, in which he successfully visited the bottom for the first time on February 3, 2019.  Definitions and use  The International Hydrographic Organization's delineation of the \\"Southern Ocean\\" has moved steadily southwards since the original 1928 edition of its Limits of Oceans and Seas. Borders and names for oceans and seas were internationally agreed when the International Hydrographic Bureau, the precursor to the IHO, convened the First International Conference on 24 July 1919. The IHO then published these in its Limits of Oceans and Seas, the first edition being 1928. Since the first edition, the limits of the Southern Ocean have moved progressively southwards; since 1953, it has been omitted from the official publication and left to local hydrographic offices to determine their own limits. The IHO included the ocean and its definition as the waters south of the 60th parallel south in its 2000 revisions, but this has not been formally adopted, due to continuing impasses about some of the content, such as the naming dispute over the Sea of Japan. The 2000 IHO definition, however, was circulated in a draft edition in 2002, and is used by some within the IHO and by some other organizations such as the CIA World Factbook and Merriam- Webster. The Australian Government regards the Southern Ocean as lying immediately south of Australia (see ). The National Geographic Society does not recognize the ocean, depicting it in a typeface different from the other world oceans; instead, it shows the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans extending to Antarctica on both its print and online maps. Map publishers using the term Southern Ocean on their maps include Hema Maps and GeoNova. = Pre-20th century = \\"Southern Ocean\\" as alternative to the Aethiopian Ocean, 18th century \\"Southern Ocean\\" is an obsolete name for the Pacific Ocean or South Pacific, coined by Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, the first European to discover it, who approached it from the north. The \\"South Seas\\" is a less archaic synonym. A 1745 British Act of Parliament established a prize for discovering a Northwest Passage to \\"the Western and Southern Ocean of America\\". Authors using \\"Southern Ocean\\" to name the waters encircling the unknown southern polar regions used varying limits. James Cook's account of his second voyage implies New Caledonia borders it. Peacock's 1795 Geographical Dictionary said it lay \\"to the southward of America and Africa\\"; John Payne in 1796 used 40 degrees as the northern limit; the 1827 Edinburgh Gazetteer used 50 degrees. The Family Magazine in 1835 divided the \\"Great Southern Ocean\\" into the \\"Southern Ocean\\" and the \\"Antarctick [sic] Ocean\\" along the Antarctic Circle, with the northern limit of the Southern Ocean being lines joining Cape Horn, the Cape of Good Hope, Van Diemen's Land and the south of New Zealand. The United Kingdom's South Australia Act 1834 described the waters forming the southern limit of the new province of South Australia as \\"the Southern Ocean\\". The Colony of Victoria's Legislative Council Act 1881 delimited part of the division of Bairnsdale as \\"along the New South Wales boundary to the Southern ocean\\". = 1928 delineation = 1928 delineation In the 1928 first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas, the Southern Ocean was delineated by land-based limits: Antarctica to the south, and South America, Africa, Australia, and Broughton Island, New Zealand to the north. The detailed land-limits used were from Cape Horn in Chile eastwards to Cape Agulhas in Africa, then further eastwards to the southern coast of mainland Australia to Cape Leeuwin, Western Australia. From Cape Leeuwin, the limit then followed eastwards along the coast of mainland Australia to Cape Otway, Victoria, then southwards across Bass Strait to Cape Wickham, King Island, along the west coast of King Island, then the remainder of the way south across Bass Strait to Cape Grim, Tasmania. The limit then followed the west coast of Tasmania southwards to the South East Cape and then went eastwards to Broughton Island, New Zealand, before returning to Cape Horn. = 1937 delineation = 1937 delineation The northern limits of the Southern Ocean were moved southwards in the IHO's 1937 second edition of the Limits of Oceans and Seas. From this edition, much of the ocean's northern limit ceased to abut land masses. In the second edition, the Southern Ocean then extended from Antarctica northwards to latitude 40¬∞S between Cape Agulhas in Africa (long. 20¬∞E) and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (long. 115¬∞E), and extended to latitude 55¬∞S between Auckland Island of New Zealand (165 or 166¬∞E east) and Cape Horn in South America (67¬∞W). As is discussed in more detail below, prior to the 2002 edition the limits of oceans explicitly excluded the seas lying within each of them. The Great Australian Bight was unnamed in the 1928 edition, and delineated as shown in the figure above in the 1937 edition. It therefore encompassed former Southern Ocean waters‚Äîas designated in 1928‚Äîbut was technically not inside any of the three adjacent oceans by 1937. In the 2002 draft edition, the IHO have designated 'seas' as being subdivisions within 'oceans', so the Bight would have still been within the Southern Ocean in 1937 if the 2002 convention were in place then. To perform direct comparisons of current and former limits of oceans it is necessary to consider, or at least be aware of, how the 2002 change in IHO terminology for 'seas' can affect the comparison. = 1953 delineation = The Southern Ocean did not appear in the 1953 third edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas, a note in the publication read: Instead, in the IHO 1953 publication, the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans were extended southward, the Indian and Pacific Oceans (which had not previously touched pre 1953, as per the first and second editions) now abutted at the meridian of South East Cape, and the southern limits of the Great Australian Bight and the Tasman Sea were moved northwards. Alternate location: AWI (DOI 10013/epic.37175.d001 scan archived). = 2002 draft delineation = Area inside the black line indicates the area constituting the Pacific Ocean prior to 2002; darker blue areas are its informal current borders following the recreation of the Southern Ocean and the reinclusion of marginal seas The IHO readdressed the question of the Southern Ocean in a survey in 2000. Of its 68 member nations, 28 responded, and all responding members except Argentina agreed to redefine the ocean, reflecting the importance placed by oceanographers on ocean currents. The proposal for the name Southern Ocean won 18 votes, beating the alternative Antarctic Ocean. Half of the votes supported a definition of the ocean's northern limit at the 60th parallel south‚Äîwith no land interruptions at this latitude‚Äîwith the other 14 votes cast for other definitions, mostly the 50th parallel south, but a few for as far north as the 35th parallel south. A draft fourth edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas was circulated to IHO member states in August 2002 (sometimes referred to as the \\"2000 edition\\" as it summarized the progress to 2000). It has yet to be published due to 'areas of concern' by several countries relating to various naming issues around the world ‚Äì primarily the Sea of Japan naming dispute ‚Äì and there have been various changes, 60 seas were given new names, and even the name of the publication was changed. A reservation had also been lodged by Australia regarding the Southern Ocean limits. Effectively, the third edition‚Äîwhich did not delineate the Southern Ocean leaving delineation to local hydrographic offices‚Äîhas yet to be superseded. Continents and islands of the Southern Ocean Despite this, the fourth edition definition has partial de facto usage by many nations, scientists and organisations such as the U.S. (the CIA World Factbook uses \\"Southern Ocean\\" but none of the other new sea names within the \\"Southern Ocean\\" such as \\"Cosmonauts Sea\\") and Merriam-Webster, scientists and nations ‚Äì and even by some within the IHO. Some nations' hydrographic offices have defined their own boundaries; the United Kingdom used the 55th parallel south for example. Other organisations favour more northerly limits for the Southern Ocean. For example, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica describes the Southern Ocean as extending as far north as South America, and confers great significance on the Antarctic Convergence, yet its description of the Indian Ocean contradicts this, describing the Indian Ocean as extending south to Antarctica. Other sources, such as the National Geographic Society, show the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans as extending to Antarctica on its maps, although articles on the National Geographic web site have begun to reference the Southern Ocean. A radical shift from past IHO practices (1928‚Äì1953) was also seen in the 2002 draft edition when the IHO delineated 'seas' as being subdivisions that lay within the boundaries of 'oceans'. While the IHO are often considered the authority for such conventions, the shift brought them into line with the practices of other publications (e.g. the CIA World Fact Book) which already adopted the principle that seas are contained within oceans. This difference in practice is markedly seen for the Pacific Ocean in the adjacent figure. Thus, for example, previously the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand was not regarded by the IHO as being part of the Pacific, but as of the 2002 draft edition it is. The new delineation of seas being subdivisions of oceans has avoided the need to interrupt the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean where intersected by Drake Passage which includes all of the waters from South America to the Antarctic coast, nor interrupt it for the Scotia Sea, which also extends below the 60th parallel south. The new delineation of seas has also meant that the long-time named seas around Antarctica, excluded from the 1953 edition (the 1953 map did not even extend that far south), are 'automatically' part of the Southern Ocean. A map of Australia's official interpretation of the names and limits of oceans and seas around Australia =Australian standpoint = In Australia, cartographical authorities define the Southern Ocean as including the entire body of water between Antarctica and the south coasts of Australia and New Zealand, and up to 60¬∞S elsewhere. Coastal maps of Tasmania and South Australia label the sea areas as Southern OceanFor example: , and Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia is described as the point where the Indian and Southern Oceans meet.  History of exploration  = Unknown southern land = 1564 Typus Orbis Terrarum, a map by Abraham Ortelius showed the imagined link between the proposed continent of Antarctica and South America. Exploration of the Southern Ocean was inspired by a belief in the existence of a Terra Australis ‚Äì a vast continent in the far south of the globe to \\"balance\\" the northern lands of Eurasia and North Africa ‚Äì which had existed since the times of Ptolemy. The doubling of the Cape of Good Hope in 1487 by Bartolomeu Dias first brought explorers within touch of the Antarctic cold, and proved that there was an ocean separating Africa from any Antarctic land that might exist. Ferdinand Magellan, who passed through the Strait of Magellan in 1520, assumed that the islands of Tierra del Fuego to the south were an extension of this unknown southern land. In 1564, Abraham Ortelius published his first map, Typus Orbis Terrarum, an eight-leaved wall map of the world, on which he identified the Regio Patalis with Locach as a northward extension of the Terra Australis, reaching as far as New Guinea.Joost Depuydt, ‚ÄòOrtelius, Abraham (1527‚Äì1598)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004Peter Barber, \\"Ortelius' great world map\\", National Library of Australia, Mapping our World: Terra Incognita to Australia, Canberra, National Library of Australia, 2013, p. 95. European geographers continued to connect the coast of Tierra del Fuego with the coast of New Guinea on their globes, and allowing their imaginations to run riot in the vast unknown spaces of the south Atlantic, south Indian and Pacific oceans they sketched the outlines of the Terra Australis Incognita (\\"Unknown Southern Land\\"), a vast continent stretching in parts into the tropics. The search for this great south land was a leading motive of explorers in the 16th and the early part of the 17th centuries. The Spaniard Gabriel de Castilla, who claimed having sighted \\"snow-covered mountains\\" beyond the 64¬∞ S in 1603, is recognized as the first explorer that discovered the continent of Antarctica, although he was ignored in his time. In 1606, Pedro Fern√°ndez de Quir√≥s took possession for the king of Spain all of the lands he had discovered in Australia del Espiritu Santo (the New Hebrides) and those he would discover \\"even to the Pole\\". Francis Drake, like Spanish explorers before him, had speculated that there might be an open channel south of Tierra del Fuego. When Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire discovered the southern extremity of Tierra del Fuego and named it Cape Horn in 1615, they proved that the Tierra del Fuego archipelago was of small extent and not connected to the southern land, as previously thought. Subsequently, in 1642, Abel Tasman showed that even New Holland (Australia) was separated by sea from any continuous southern continent. = South of the Antarctic Convergence = Portrait of Edmund Halley by Godfrey Kneller, (before 1721) The visit to South Georgia by Anthony de la Roch√© in 1675 was the first ever discovery of land south of the Antarctic Convergence i.e. in the Southern Ocean/Antarctic.Dalrymple, Alexander.

(Relevant fragment) Edmond Halley's voyage in for magnetic investigations in the South Atlantic met the pack ice in 52¬∞ S in January 1700, but that latitude (he reached 140 mi off the north coast of South Georgia) was his farthest south. A determined effort on the part of the French naval officer Jean-Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier to discover the \\"South Land\\" ‚Äì described by a half legendary \\"sieur de Gonneyville\\" ‚Äì resulted in the discovery of Bouvet Island in 54¬∞10‚Ä≤ S, and in the navigation of 48¬∞ of longitude of ice-cumbered sea nearly in 55¬∞ S in 1730. In 1771, Yves Joseph Kerguelen sailed from France with instructions to proceed south from Mauritius in search of \\"a very large continent\\". He lighted upon a land in 50¬∞ S which he called South France, and believed to be the central mass of the southern continent. He was sent out again to complete the exploration of the new land, and found it to be only an inhospitable island which he renamed the Isle of Desolation, but which was ultimately named after him. = South of the Antarctic Circle = \\"Terres Australes\\" (sic) label without any charted landmass James Weddell's second expedition in 1823, depicting the brig and the cutter Beaufroy The obsession of the undiscovered continent culminated in the brain of Alexander Dalrymple, the brilliant and erratic hydrographer who was nominated by the Royal Society to command the Transit of Venus expedition to Tahiti in 1769. The command of the expedition was given by the admiralty to Captain James Cook. Sailing in 1772 with Resolution, a vessel of 462 tons under his own command and Adventure of 336 tons under Captain Tobias Furneaux, Cook first searched in vain for Bouvet Island, then sailed for 20 degrees of longitude to the westward in latitude 58¬∞ S, and then 30¬∞ eastward for the most part south of 60¬∞ S, a lower southern latitude than had ever been voluntarily entered before by any vessel. On 17 January 1773 the Antarctic Circle was crossed for the first time in history and the two ships reached by , where their course was stopped by ice. Famous official portrait of Captain James Cook who proved that waters encompassed the southern latitudes of the globe. \\"He holds his own chart of the Southern Ocean on the table and his right hand points to the east coast of Australia on it.\\" Cook then turned northward to look for French Southern and Antarctic Lands, of the discovery of which he had received news at Cape Town, but from the rough determination of his longitude by Kerguelen, Cook reached the assigned latitude 10¬∞ too far east and did not see it. He turned south again and was stopped by ice in by 95¬∞ E and continued eastward nearly on the parallel of 60¬∞ S to 147¬∞ E. On 16 March, the approaching winter drove him northward for rest to New Zealand and the tropical islands of the Pacific. In November 1773, Cook left New Zealand, having parted company with the Adventure, and reached 60¬∞ S by 177¬∞ W, whence he sailed eastward keeping as far south as the floating ice allowed. The Antarctic Circle was crossed on 20 December and Cook remained south of it for three days, being compelled after reaching to stand north again in 135¬∞ W. A long detour to served to show that there was no land connection between New Zealand and Tierra del Fuego. Turning south again, Cook crossed the Antarctic Circle for the third time at before his progress was once again blocked by ice four days later at by . This point, reached on 30 January 1774, was the farthest south attained in the 18th century. With a great detour to the east, almost to the coast of South America, the expedition regained Tahiti for refreshment. In November 1774, Cook started from New Zealand and crossed the South Pacific without sighting land between 53¬∞ and 57¬∞ S to Tierra del Fuego; then, passing Cape Horn on 29 December, he rediscovered Roch√© Island renaming it Isle of Georgia, and discovered the South Sandwich Islands (named Sandwich Land by him), the only ice-clad land he had seen, before crossing the South Atlantic to the Cape of Good Hope between 55¬∞ and 60¬∞. He thereby laid open the way for future Antarctic exploration by exploding the myth of a habitable southern continent. Cook's most southerly discovery of land lay on the temperate side of the 60th parallel, and he convinced himself that if land lay farther south it was practically inaccessible and without economic value. Voyagers rounding Cape Horn frequently met with contrary winds and were driven southward into snowy skies and ice-encumbered seas; but so far as can be ascertained none of them before 1770 reached the Antarctic Circle, or knew it, if they did. In a voyage from 1822 to 1824, James Weddell commanded the 160-ton brig Jane, accompanied by his second ship Beaufoy captained by Matthew Brisbane. Together they sailed to the South Orkneys where sealing proved disappointing. They turned south in the hope of finding a better sealing ground. The season was unusually mild and tranquil, and on 20 February 1823 the two ships reached latitude 74¬∞15' S and longitude 34¬∞16'45‚Ä≥ W the southernmost position any ship had ever reached up to that time. A few icebergs were sighted but there was still no sight of land, leading Weddell to theorize that the sea continued as far as the South Pole. Another two days' sailing would have brought him to Coat's Land (to the east of the Weddell Sea) but Weddell decided to turn back. = First sighting of land = Admiral von Bellingshausen The first land south of the parallel 60¬∞ south latitude was discovered by the Englishman William Smith, who sighted Livingston Island on 19 February 1819. A few months later Smith returned to explore the other islands of the South Shetlands archipelago, landed on King George Island, and claimed the new territories for Britain. In the meantime, the Spanish Navy ship San Telmo sank in September 1819 when trying to cross Cape Horn. Parts of her wreckage were found months later by sealers on the north coast of Livingston Island (South Shetlands). It is unknown if some survivor managed to be the first to set foot on these Antarctic islands. The first confirmed sighting of mainland Antarctica cannot be accurately attributed to one single person. It can, however, be narrowed down to three individuals. According to various sources,Palmer Station. ucsd.edu three men all sighted the ice shelf or the continent within days or months of each other: Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen, a captain in the Russian Imperial Navy; Edward Bransfield, a captain in the Royal Navy; and Nathaniel Palmer, an American sealer out of Stonington, Connecticut. It is certain that the expedition, led by von Bellingshausen and Lazarev on the ships Vostok and Mirny, reached a point within from Princess Martha Coast and recorded the sight of an ice shelf at that became known as the Fimbul Ice Shelf. On 30 January 1820, Bransfield sighted Trinity Peninsula, the northernmost point of the Antarctic mainland, while Palmer sighted the mainland in the area south of Trinity Peninsula in November 1820. Von Bellingshausen's expedition also discovered Peter I Island and Alexander I Island, the first islands to be discovered south of the circle. = Antarctic expeditions = USS Vincennes at Disappointment Bay, Antarctica in early 1840. 1911 South Polar Regions exploration map In December 1839, as part of the United States Exploring Expedition of 1838‚Äì42 conducted by the United States Navy (sometimes called \\"the Wilkes Expedition\\"), an expedition sailed from Sydney, Australia, on the sloops-of-war and , the brig , the full-rigged ship , and two schooners and .

That part of Antarctica was later named \\"Wilkes Land\\", a name it maintains to this day. Explorer James Clark Ross passed through what is now known as the Ross Sea and discovered Ross Island (both of which were named for him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the Ross Ice Shelf. Mount Erebus and Mount Terror are named after two ships from his expedition: and .

The Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914, led by Ernest Shackleton, set out to cross the continent via the pole, but their ship, , was trapped and crushed by pack ice before they even landed. The expedition members survived after an epic journey on sledges over pack ice to Elephant Island. Then Shackleton and five others crossed the Southern Ocean, in an open boat called James Caird, and then trekked over South Georgia to raise the alarm at the whaling station Grytviken. In 1946, US Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd and more than 4,700 military personnel visited the Antarctic in an expedition called Operation Highjump. Reported to the public as a scientific mission, the details were kept secret and it may have actually been a training or testing mission for the military. The expedition was, in both military or scientific planning terms, put together very quickly. The group contained an unusually high amount of military equipment, including an aircraft carrier, submarines, military support ships, assault troops and military vehicles. The expedition was planned to last for eight months but was unexpectedly terminated after only two months. With the exception of some eccentric entries in Admiral Byrd's diaries, no real explanation for the early termination has ever been officially given. Captain Finn Ronne, Byrd's executive officer, returned to Antarctica with his own expedition in 1947‚Äì1948, with Navy support, three planes, and dogs. Ronne disproved the notion that the continent was divided in two and established that East and West Antarctica was one single continent, i.e. that the Weddell Sea and the Ross Sea are not connected.

Explorer was the first cruise ship used specifically to sail the icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean and the first to sink there when she struck an unidentified submerged object on 23 November 2007, reported to be ice, which caused a gash in the hull. Explorer was abandoned in the early hours of 23 November 2007 after taking on water near the South Shetland Islands in the Southern Ocean, an area which is usually stormy but was calm at the time. Explorer was confirmed by the Chilean Navy to have sunk at approximately position: 62¬∞ 24‚Ä≤ South, 57¬∞ 16‚Ä≤ West, in roughly 600 m of water.MV Explorer Cruise Ship Sinking In South Atlantic, The Shipping Times, 23 November 2007 British engineer Richard Jenkins designed an unmanned surface vehicle called a \\"saildrone\\" that completed the first autonomous circumnavigation of the Southern Ocean on 3 August 2019 after 196 days at sea. The first completely human-powered expedition on the Southern Ocean was accomplished on 25 December 2019 by a team of rowers comprising captain Fiann Paul (Iceland), first mate Colin O'Brady (US), Andrew Towne (US), Cameron Bellamy (South Africa), Jamie Douglas-Hamilton (UK) and John Petersen (US).  Geography  The Southern Ocean, geologically the youngest of the oceans, was formed when Antarctica and South America moved apart, opening the Drake Passage, roughly 30 million years ago. The separation of the continents allowed the formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. With a northern limit at 60¬∞S, the Southern Ocean differs from the other oceans in that its largest boundary, the northern boundary, does not abut a landmass (as it did with the first edition of Limits of Oceans and Seas). Instead, the northern limit is with the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. One reason for considering it as a separate ocean stems from the fact that much of the water of the Southern Ocean differs from the water in the other oceans. Water gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica. Water in the Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles the water in the Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles the water in the Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean has typical depths of between over most of its extent with only limited areas of shallow water. The Southern Ocean's greatest depth of occurs at the southern end of the South Sandwich Trench, at 60¬∞00'S, 024¬∞W. The Antarctic continental shelf appears generally narrow and unusually deep, its edge lying at depths up to , compared to a global mean of . Equinox to equinox in line with the sun's seasonal influence, the Antarctic ice pack fluctuates from an average minimum of in March to about in September, more than a sevenfold increase in area. = Sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean = Seas that are parts of the Southern Ocean Sub-divisions of oceans are geographical features such as \\"seas\\", \\"straits\\", \\"bays\\", \\"channels\\", and \\"gulfs\\". There are many sub-divisions of the Southern Ocean defined in the never-approved 2002 draft fourth edition of the IHO publication Limits of Oceans and Seas. In clockwise order these include (with sector): * Weddell Sea (57¬∞18'W ‚Äì 12¬∞16'E) * King Haakon VII Sea (20¬∞W ‚Äì 45¬∞E) * Lazarev Sea (0¬∞ ‚Äì 14¬∞E) * Riiser-Larsen Sea (14¬∞ ‚Äì 30¬∞E) * Cosmonauts Sea (30¬∞ ‚Äì 50¬∞E) * Cooperation Sea (59¬∞34' ‚Äì 85¬∞E) * Davis Sea (82¬∞ ‚Äì 96¬∞E) * Mawson Sea (95¬∞45' ‚Äì 113¬∞E) * Dumont D'Urville Sea (140¬∞E) * Somov Sea (150¬∞ ‚Äì 170¬∞E) * Ross Sea (166¬∞E ‚Äì 155¬∞W) * Amundsen Sea (102¬∞20‚Ä≤ ‚Äì 126¬∞W) * Bellingshausen Sea (57¬∞18' ‚Äì 102¬∞20'W) * Part of the Drake Passage (54¬∞ ‚Äì 68¬∞W) * Bransfield Strait (54¬∞ ‚Äì 62¬∞W) * Part of the Scotia Sea (26¬∞30' ‚Äì 65¬∞W) A number of these such as the 2002 Russian-proposed \\"Cosmonauts Sea\\", \\"Cooperation Sea\\", and \\"Somov (mid-1950s Russian polar explorer) Sea\\" are not included in the 1953 IHO document which remains currently in force, because they received their names largely originated from 1962 onward. Leading geographic authorities and atlases do not use these latter three names, including the 2014 10th edition World Atlas from the United States' National Geographic Society and the 2014 12th edition of the British Times Atlas of the World, but Soviet and Russian-issued maps do. =Biggest seas in Southern Ocean= Top large seas:https://www.livescience.com/29533-the-worlds-biggest- oceans-and-seas.htmlhttps://www.worldatlas.com/http://listofseas.com/ # Weddell Sea - 2.8 million km¬≤ # Somov Sea - 1.15 million km¬≤ # Riiser-Larsen Sea - 1.138 million km¬≤ # Lazarev Sea - 929,000 km¬≤ # Scotia Sea - 900,000 km¬≤ # Cosmonauts Sea - 699,000 km¬≤ # Ross Sea - 637,000 km¬≤ # Bellingshausen Sea - 487,000 km¬≤ # Mawson Sea - 333,000 km¬≤ # Cooperation Sea - 258,000 km¬≤ # Amundsen Sea - 98,000 km¬≤ # Davis Sea - 21,000 km¬≤ # D'Urville Sea # King Haakon VII Sea = Natural resources = Manganese nodule The Southern Ocean probably contains large, and possibly giant, oil and gas fields on the continental margin. Placer deposits, accumulation of valuable minerals such as gold, formed by gravity separation during sedimentary processes are also expected to exist in the Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are expected to exist in the Southern Ocean. Manganese nodules are rock concretions on the sea bottom formed of concentric layers of iron and manganese hydroxides around a core. The core may be microscopically small and is sometimes completely transformed into manganese minerals by crystallization. Interest in the potential exploitation of polymetallic nodules generated a great deal of activity among prospective mining consortia in the 1960s and 1970s. The icebergs that form each year around in the Southern Ocean hold enough fresh water to meet the needs of every person on Earth for several months. For several decades there have been proposals, none yet to be feasible or successful, to tow Southern Ocean icebergs to more arid northern regions (such as Australia) where they can be harvested. = Natural hazards = An iceberg being pushed out of a shipping lane by (L to R) , , and near McMurdo Station, Antarctica, 1965 Icebergs can occur at any time of year throughout the ocean. Some may have drafts up to several hundred meters; smaller icebergs, iceberg fragments and sea-ice (generally 0.5 to 1 m thick) also pose problems for ships. The deep continental shelf has a floor of glacial deposits varying widely over short distances. Sailors know latitudes from 40 to 70 degrees south as the \\"Roaring Forties\\", \\"Furious Fifties\\" and \\"Shrieking Sixties\\" due to high winds and large waves that form as winds blow around the entire globe unimpeded by any land-mass. Icebergs, especially in May to October, make the area even more dangerous. The remoteness of the region makes sources of search and rescue scarce.  Physical oceanography  The Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) is the strongest current system in the world oceans, linking the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific basins. = Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Antarctic Convergence = The Antarctic Circumpolar Current moves perpetually eastward ‚Äì chasing and joining itself, and at in length ‚Äì it comprises the world's longest ocean current, transporting of water ‚Äì 100 times the flow of all the world's rivers. Several processes operate along the coast of Antarctica to produce, in the Southern Ocean, types of water masses not produced elsewhere in the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. One of these is the Antarctic Bottom Water, a very cold, highly saline, dense water that forms under sea ice. Associated with the Circumpolar Current is the Antarctic Convergence encircling Antarctica, where cold northward-flowing Antarctic waters meet the relatively warmer waters of the subantarctic, Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath subantarctic waters, while associated zones of mixing and upwelling create a zone very high in nutrients. These nurture high levels of phytoplankton with associated copepods and Antarctic krill, and resultant foodchains supporting fish, whales, seals, penguins, albatrosses and a wealth of other species. The Antarctic Convergence is considered to be the best natural definition of the northern extent of the Southern Ocean. = Upwelling = Large-scale upwelling is found in the Southern Ocean. Strong westerly (eastward) winds blow around Antarctica, driving a significant flow of water northwards. This is actually a type of coastal upwelling. Since there are no continents in a band of open latitudes between South America and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, some of this water is drawn up from great depths. In many numerical models and observational syntheses, the Southern Ocean upwelling represents the primary means by which deep dense water is brought to the surface. Shallower, wind-driven upwelling is also found off the west coasts of North and South America, northwest and southwest Africa, and southwest and southeast Australia, all associated with oceanic subtropical high pressure circulations. Some models of the ocean circulation suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some diffusive upwelling does probably occur. Location of the Southern Ocean gyres. = Ross and Weddell Gyres = The Ross Gyre and Weddell Gyre are two gyres that exist within the Southern Ocean. The gyres are located in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea respectively, and both rotate clockwise. The gyres are formed by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the Antarctic Continental Shelf. Sea ice has been noted to persist in the central area of the Ross Gyre. p. 10. There is some evidence that global warming has resulted in some decrease of the salinity of the waters of the Ross Gyre since the 1950s. Due to the Coriolis effect acting to the left in the Southern Hemisphere and the resulting Ekman transport away from the centres of the Weddell Gyre, these regions are very productive due to upwelling of cold, nutrient rich water.  Climate  Sea temperatures vary from about ‚àí2 to 10 ¬∞C (28 to 50 ¬∞F). Cyclonic storms travel eastward around the continent and frequently become intense because of the temperature contrast between ice and open ocean. The ocean-area from about latitude 40 south to the Antarctic Circle has the strongest average winds found anywhere on Earth. In winter the ocean freezes outward to 65 degrees south latitude in the Pacific sector and 55 degrees south latitude in the Atlantic sector, lowering surface temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius. At some coastal points, however, persistent intense drainage winds from the interior keep the shoreline ice-free throughout the winter.  Biodiversity  Orca (Orcinus orca) hunting a Weddell seal in the Southern Ocean = Animals = A variety of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and fur seals. The emperor penguin is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Ad√©lie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic. The Antarctic fur seal was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The Weddell seal, a \\"true seal\\", is named after Sir James Weddell, commander of British sealing expeditions in the Weddell Sea. Antarctic krill, which congregates in large schools, is the keystone species of the ecosystem of the Southern Ocean, and is an important food organism for whales, seals, leopard seals, fur seals, squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other birds. The benthic communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in . As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Deep-sea gigantism is common among these animals. A census of sea life carried out during the International Polar Year and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global Census of Marine Life (CoML) and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of . Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as mudworms, sea cucumbers and free- swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution ‚Äì fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than , and the major current systems or marine conveyor belt which transport egg and larva stages. However, among smaller marine animals generally assumed to be the same in the Antarctica and the Arctic, more detailed studies of each population have often‚Äîbut not always‚Äîrevealed differences, showing that they are closely related cryptic species rather than a single bipolar species. A wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) on South Georgia = Birds = The rocky shores of mainland Antarctica and its offshore islands provide nesting space for over 100 million birds every spring. These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns. The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Freshwater ducks inhabit South Georgia and the Kerguelen Islands. The flightless penguins are all located in the Southern Hemisphere, with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands. Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter. = Fish = There are relatively few fish species in few families in the Southern Ocean. The most species-rich family are the snailfish (Liparidae), followed by the cod icefish (Nototheniidae) and eelpout (Zoarcidae). Together the snailfish, eelpouts and notothenioids (which includes cod icefish and several other families) account for almost of the more than 320 described fish species of the Southern Ocean (tens of undescribed species also occur in the region, especially among the snailfish). Southern Ocean snailfish are generally found in deep waters, while the icefish also occur in shallower waters.  Icefish  Fish of the Notothenioidei suborder, such as this young icefish, are mostly restricted to the Antarctic and Subantarctic Cod icefish (Nototheniidae), as well as several other families, are part of the Notothenioidei suborder, collectively sometimes referred to as icefish. The suborder contains many species with antifreeze proteins in their blood and tissue, allowing them to live in water that is around or slightly below . Antifreeze proteins are also known from Southern Ocean snailfish. The crocodile icefish (family Channichthyidae), also known as white-blooded fish, are only found in the Southern Ocean. They lack hemoglobin in their blood, resulting in their blood being colourless. One Channichthyidae species, the mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), was once the most common fish in coastal waters less than deep, but was overfished in the 1970s and 1980s. Schools of icefish spend the day at the seafloor and the night higher in the water column eating plankton and smaller fish. There are two species from the genus Dissostichus, the Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) and the Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). These two species live on the seafloor deep, and can grow to around long weighing up to , living up to 45 years. The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Toothfish are commercially fished, and overfishing has reduced toothfish populations. Another abundant fish group is the genus Notothenia, which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies. An unusual species of icefish is the Antarctic silverfish (Pleuragramma antarcticum), which is the only truly pelagic fish in the waters near Antarctica. Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) are the most southerly of Antarctic mammals. = Mammals = Seven pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the elephant seal (Mirounga leonina), can reach up to , while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella), reach only . These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophagus) and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators. The four species that inhabit sea ice are thought to make up 50% of the total biomass of the world's seals. Crabeater seals have a population of around 15 million, making them one of the most numerous large animals on the planet. The New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri), one of the rarest and most localised pinnipeds, breeds almost exclusively on the subantarctic Auckland Islands, although historically it had a wider range. Out of all permanent mammalian residents, the Weddell seals live the furthest south. There are 10 cetacean species found in the Southern Ocean; six baleen whales, and four toothed whales. The largest of these, the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), grows to long weighing 84 tonnes. Many of these species are migratory, and travel to tropical waters during the Antarctic winter. Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a keystone species of the food web. = Invertebrates =  Arthropods  Five species of krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, have been found in the Southern Ocean. The Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is one of the most abundant animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is long and weighs over . The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per , turning the water red. Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival. During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition. Many benthic crustaceans have a non-seasonal breeding cycle, and some raise their young in a brood pouch. Glyptonotus antarcticus is an unusually large benthic isopod, reaching in length weighing . Amphipods are abundant in soft sediments, eating a range of items, from algae to other animals. The amphipods are highly diverse with more than 600 recognized species found south of the Antarctic Convergence and there are indications that many undescribed species remain. Among these are several \\"giants\\", such as the iconic epimeriids that are up to long. Slow moving sea spiders are common, sometimes growing as large as a human hand. They feed on the corals, sponges, and bryozoans that litter the seabed. warty squid (Moroteuthis ingens)  Others  Many aquatic molluscs are present in Antarctica. Bivalves such as Adamussium colbecki move around on the seafloor, while others such as Laternula elliptica live in burrows filtering the water above. There are around 70 cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean, the largest of which is the colossal squid (Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni), which at up to is among the largest invertebrate in the world. Squid makes up most of the diet of some animals, such as grey- headed albatrosses and sperm whales, and the warty squid (Moroteuthis ingens) is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates. The sea urchin genus Abatus burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it. Two species of salps are common in Antarctic waters, Salpa thompsoni and Ihlea racovitzai. Salpa thompsoni is found in ice-free areas, whereas Ihlea racovitzai is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce. Antarctic sponges are long lived, and sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health.  Environment  = Current issues = Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality. = International agreements = All international agreements regarding the world's oceans apply to the Southern Ocean. In addition, it is subject to these agreements specific to the region: * The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) prohibits commercial whaling south of 40 degrees south (south of 60 degrees south between 50 degrees and 130 degrees west). Japan regularly does not recognize this provision, because the sanctuary violates IWC charter. Since the scope of the sanctuary is limited to commercial whaling, in regard to its whaling permit and whaling for scientific research, a Japanese fleet carried out an annual whale-hunt in the region. On 31 March 2014, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan's whaling program, which Japan has long claimed is for scientific purposes, was a cloak for commercial whaling, and no further permits would be granted. * Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals is part of the Antarctic Treaty System. It was signed at the conclusion of a multilateral conference in London on 11 February 1972.Antarctic Challenge: Conflicting Interests, Cooperation, Environmental Protection, Economic Development Proceedings of an Interdisciplinary Symposium, 22‚Äì24 June 1983; Volume 88 of Ver√∂ffentlichungen des Instituts f√ºr Internationales Recht an der Universit√§t Kiel (R√ºdiger Wolfrum and Klaus Bockslaff, eds.), Duncker & Humblot, 1984, p. 99 * Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) is part of the Antarctic Treaty System. The Convention was entered into force on 7 April 1982 and has its goal is to preserve marine life and environmental integrity in and near Antarctica. It was established in large part to concerns that an increase in krill catches in the Southern Ocean could have a serious impact on populations of other marine life which are dependent upon krill for food. Many nations prohibit the exploration for and the exploitation of mineral resources south of the fluctuating Antarctic Convergence, which lies in the middle of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and serves as the dividing line between the very cold polar surface waters to the south and the warmer waters to the north. The Antarctic Treaty covers the portion of the globe south of sixty degrees south,The Antarctic Treaty, article 6 it prohibits new claims to Antarctica.The Antarctic Treaty, article 4, clause 2 The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources applies to the area south of 60¬∞ South latitude as well as the areas further north up to the limit of the Antarctic Convergence.  Economy  Between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999, fisheries landed 119,898 tonnes, of which 85% consisted of krill and 14% of Patagonian toothfish. International agreements came into force in late 1999 to reduce illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 1998‚Äì99 season landed five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery.  Ports and harbors  Severe cracks in an ice pier in use for four seasons at McMurdo Station slowed cargo operations in 1983 and proved a safety hazard. Major operational ports include: Rothera Station, Palmer Station, Villa Las Estrellas, Esperanza Base, Mawson Station, McMurdo Station, and offshore anchorages in Antarctica. Few ports or harbors exist on the southern (Antarctic) coast of the Southern Ocean, since ice conditions limit use of most shores to short periods in midsummer; even then some require icebreaker escort for access. Most Antarctic ports are operated by government research stations and, except in an emergency, remain closed to commercial or private vessels; vessels in any port south of 60 degrees south are subject to inspection by Antarctic Treaty observers. The Southern Ocean's southernmost port operates at McMurdo Station at . Winter Quarters Bay forms a small harbor, on the southern tip of Ross Island where a floating ice pier makes port operations possible in summer. Operation Deep Freeze personnel constructed the first ice pier at McMurdo in 1973.\\"Unique ice pier provides harbor for ships,\\" Antarctic Sun. 8 January 2006; McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Based on the original 1928 IHO delineation of the Southern Ocean (and the 1937 delineation if the Great Australian Bight is considered integral), Australian ports and harbors between Cape Leeuwin and Cape Otway on the Australian mainland and along the west coast of Tasmania would also be identified as ports and harbors existing in the Southern Ocean. These would include the larger ports and harbors of Albany, Thevenard, Port Lincoln, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Adelaide, Portland, Warrnambool, and Macquarie Harbour. Even though organizers of several Yacht races define their routes as involving the Southern Ocean, the actual routes don't enter the actual geographical boundaries of the Southern Ocean. The routes involve instead South Atlantic, South Pacific and Indian Ocean.

Located in Melanesia in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, it is separated by the wide Torres Strait from the Australian continent. Numerous smaller islands are located to the west and east. The eastern half of the island is the major land mass of the independent state of Papua New Guinea. The western half, known as Western New Guinea or West Papua,https://web.archive.org/web/20200209234437/https://www.tapol.org/our- work/west-papua forms a part of Indonesia and is organized as the provinces of Papua and West Papua.  Names  1644 map of New Guinea and the surrounding area. The island has been known by various names: The name Papua was used to refer to parts of the island before contact with the West. Its etymology is unclear; one theory states that it derived from Tidore, the language used by the Sultanate of Tidore, which controlled parts of the island's coastal region. The name appears to come from the words papo (to unite) and ua (negation), which means \\"not united\\" or, \\"territory that geographically is far away (and thus not united)\\". Ploeg reports that the word papua is often said to be derived from the Malay word papua or pua-pua, meaning \\"frizzly-haired\\", referring to the highly curly hair of the inhabitants of these areas. Another possibility, put forward by Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993, is that it comes from the Biak phrase sup i papwa, which means 'the land below [the sunset]', and refers to the islands west of the Bird's Head, as far as Halmahera. The name Papua came to be associated with this area, and more especially with Halmahera, which was known to the Portuguese by this name during the era of their colonization in this part of the world. When the Portuguese and Spanish explorers arrived in the island via the Spice Islands, they also referred to the island as Papua. However, Westerners, beginning with Spanish explorer Y√±igo Ortiz de Retez in 1545, used the name New Guinea, referring to the similarities of the features of the indigenous peoples to those of native Africans of the Guinea region of the continent. The name is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \\"land of the blacks\\" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants. The Dutch, who arrived later under Jacob Le Maire and Willem Schouten, called it Schouten island. They later used this name only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the Schouten Islands or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized this island as part of the Dutch East Indies, they called it Nieuw Guinea. The name Irian was used in the Indonesian language to refer to the island and Indonesian province, as Irian Barat (West Irian) Province and later Irian Jaya Province. The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo, brother of the future governor Frans Kaisiepo. It is taken from the Biak language of Biak Island, and means \\"to rise\\", or \\"rising spirit\\". Irian is the name used in the Biak language and other languages such as Serui, Merauke and Waropen. The name was used until 2001, when Papua was again used for the island and the province. The name Irian, which was originally favored by natives, is now considered to be a name imposed by the authority of Jakarta.  Geography  Regions of Oceania: Australasia, Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia. Physiographically, Australasia includes the Australian landmass (including Tasmania), New Zealand, and New Guinea. New Guinea located in relation to Melanesia New Guinea map of K√∂ppen climate classification Topographical map of New Guinea New Guinea is an island to the north of the Australian mainland, south of the equator. It is isolated by the Arafura Sea to the west, and the Torres Strait and Coral Sea to the east. Sometimes considered to be the easternmost island of the Indonesian archipelago, it lies north of Australia's Top End, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York Peninsula, and west of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands archipelago. Politically, the western half of the island comprises two provinces of Indonesia: Papua and West Papua. The eastern half forms the mainland of the country of Papua New Guinea. The shape of New Guinea is often compared to that of a bird-of-paradise (indigenous to the island), and this results in the usual names for the two extremes of the island: the Bird's Head Peninsula in the northwest (Vogelkop in Dutch, Kepala Burung in Indonesian; also known as the Doberai Peninsula), and the Bird's Tail Peninsula in the southeast (also known as the Papuan Peninsula). A spine of east‚Äìwest mountains, the New Guinea Highlands, dominates the geography of New Guinea, stretching over across the island, with many mountains over . The western half of the island contains the highest mountains in Oceania, with its highest point, Puncak Jaya, reaching an elevation of 4,884 m (16,023 ft). The tree line is around elevation, and the tallest peaks contain equatorial glaciers‚Äîwhich have been retreating since at least 1936.Prentice, M.L. and G.S. Hope (2006). \\"Climate of Papua\\".

The recession of the Carstensz Glaciers from ~11 km2 in 1942 to 2.4 km2 by 2000 represents about an 80% decrease in ice area.\\"Kincaid and Kline, \\"Retreat of the Irian Jaya Glaciers from 2000 to 2002 as Measured from IKONOS Satellite Images\\", paper presented at 61st Eastern Snow Conference, Portland, Maine, 2004Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview Various other smaller mountain ranges occur both north and west of the central ranges. Except in high elevations, most areas possess a warm humid climate throughout the year, with some seasonal variation associated with the northeast monsoon season. Mount Bosavi Another major habitat feature is the vast southern and northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometres, these include lowland rainforests, extensive wetlands, savanna grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of mangrove forest in the world. The southern lowlands are the site of Lorentz National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the Mamberamo River and its tributaries on the western side, and by the Sepik on the eastern side. The more extensive southern lowlands are drained by a larger number of rivers, principally the Digul in the west and the Fly in the east. The largest island offshore, Dolak, lies near the Digul estuary, separated by a strait so narrow it has been named a \\"creek\\". New Guinea contains many of the world's ecosystem types: glacial, alpine tundra, savanna, montane and lowland rainforest, mangroves, wetlands, lake and river ecosystems, seagrasses, and some of the richest coral reefs on the planet.  Relation to surroundings  The island of New Guinea lies to the east of the Malay Archipelago, with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater Indo- Australian Archipelago. Geologically it is a part of the same tectonic plate as Australia. When world sea levels were low, the two shared shorelines (which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level), and combined with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of Sahul, also known as Greater Australia. The two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the last glacial period. Anthropologically, New Guinea is considered part of Melanesia.\\"Melanesia, the ethnogeographic region that includes New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and New Caledonia, contains some of the most remote and inaccessible populations on earth.\\" Highly divergent molecular variants of human T-lymphotropic virus type I from isolated populations in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, A Gessian, R Yanagihara, G Franchini, R M Garruto, C L Jenkins, A B Ajdukiewicz, R C Gallo, and D C Gajdusek, PNAS September 1, 1991 vol. 88 no. 17 7694‚Äì7698 New Guinea is differentiated from its drier, flatter, and less fertile \\"Well, Australia has by far the world's least fertile soils\\". \\"Australia has the oldest, most highly weathered soils on the planet.\\" southern counterpart, Australia, by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology. Yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna, with marsupials, including wallabies and possums, and the egg-laying monotreme, the echidna. Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera, there are no pre-human indigenous placental mammals. Pigs, several additional species of rats, and the ancestor of the New Guinea singing dog were introduced with human colonization. Prior to the 1970s, archaeologists called the single Pleistocene landmass by the name Australasia, although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands, such as New Zealand, which are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, they introduced the term Greater Australia for the Pleistocene continent. Then, at a 1975 conference and consequent publication, they extended the name Sahul from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent.  Political divisions  Political divisions of New Guinea The island of New Guinea is divided politically into roughly equal halves across a north-south line: * The western portion of the island located west of 141¬∞E longitude (except for a small section of territory to the east of the Fly River which belongs to Papua New Guinea) was formerly a Dutch colony, part of the Dutch East Indies. After the Dutch New Guinea Dispute it is now two Indonesian provinces: ** West Papua with Manokwari as its capital. ** Papua with the city of Jayapura as its capital. * The eastern part forms the mainland of Papua New Guinea, which has been an independent country since 1975. It was formerly the Territory of Papua and New Guinea governed by Australia, consisting of the Trust Territory of New Guinea (northeastern quarter, formerly German New Guinea), and the Territory of Papua (southeastern quarter). The Papua New Guinea part encompasses three of four regions: ** Southern, consisting of Western, Gulf, Central, Oro (Northern) and Milne Bay provinces. ** Highlands, consisting of Southern Highlands, Hela Province, Jiwaka Province, Enga Province, Western Highlands, Simbu and Eastern Highlands provinces. ** Momase, consisting of Morobe, Madang, East Sepik and Sandaun (West Sepik) provinces.  People  Dani tribesman in the Baliem Valley The current population of the island of New Guinea is about eleven million. Many believe human habitation on the island dates to as early as 50,000 BC,Anthropology Professor Glenn Summerhayes, University of Otago, New Zealand. September 2010 and first settlement possibly dating back to 60,000 years ago has been proposed. The island is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. Ethnologue's 14th edition lists 826 languages of Papua New Guinea and 257 languages of Western New Guinea, total 1073 languages, with 12 languages overlapping. They can be divided into two groups, the Austronesian languages, and all the others, called Papuan languages for convenience. The term Papuan languages refers to an areal grouping, rather than a linguistic one, since so-called Papuan languages comprise hundreds of different languages, most of which are not related. The separation is not merely linguistic; warfare among societies was a factor in the evolution of the men's house: separate housing of groups of adult men, from the single-family houses of the women and children, for mutual protection from other tribal groups. Pig-based trade between the groups and pig-based feasts are a common theme with the other peoples of southeast Asia and Oceania. Most societies practice agriculture, supplemented by hunting and gathering. Kurulu Village War Chief at Baliem Valley Current evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time (either side of the Last Glacial Maximum, approx 21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a land bridge, forming the landmass of Sahul. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of Wallacea and Sundaland (the present Malay Archipelago) by at least 40,000 years ago. Korowai tribesman The ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from Southeast Asia, possibly originating in Taiwan. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as New Ireland and New Britain, with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of New Guinea over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement through events like transmigration. About half of the 2.4 million inhabitants of Indonesian Papua are Javanese migrants.Philippe Pataud Celerier, Autonomy isn‚Äôt independence; Indonesian democracy stops in Papua, Le Monde Diplomatique, June 2010 Large areas of New Guinea are yet to be explored by scientists and anthropologists. The Indonesian province of West Papua is home to an estimated 44 uncontacted tribal groups.First contact with isolated tribes?  Biodiversity and ecology  With some 786,000 km2 of tropical land‚Äîless than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Earth's surface‚ÄîNew Guinea has an immense biodiversity, containing between 5 and 10 percent of the total species on the planet. This percentage is about the same amount as that found in the United States or Australia. A high percentage of New Guinea's species are endemic, and thousands are still unknown to science: probably well over 200,000 species of insect, between 11,000 and 20,000 plant species, and over 650 resident bird species. Most of these species are shared, at least in their origin, with the continent of Australia, which was until fairly recent geological times part of the same landmass (see Australia-New Guinea for an overview). The island is so large that it is considered 'nearly a continent' in terms of its biological distinctiveness. In the period from 1998 to 2008, conservationists identified 1,060 new species in New Guinea, including 218 plants, 43 reptiles, 12 mammals, 580 invertebrates, 134 amphibians, 2 birds and 71 fish. Between 2011 and 2017, researchers described 465 previously undocumented plant species in New Guinea. As of 2019, the Indonesian portion of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands is estimated to have 9,518 species of vascular plants, of which 4,380 are endemic. In 2020, an international study conducted by a team of 99 experts cataloged 13,634 species representing 1,742 genera and 264 families of vascular plants for New Guinea and its associated islands (Aru Is., Bismarck Arch., D'Entrecasteaux Is., Louisiade Arch.), making it the world's most floristically diverse island, surpassing Madagascar (11,488), Borneo (11,165), Java (4,598), and the Philippines (9,432). The raggiana bird-of-paradise is native to New Guinea. The floristic region of Malesia Biogeographically, New Guinea is part of Australasia rather than the Indomalayan realm, although New Guinea's flora has many more affinities with Asia than its fauna, which is overwhelmingly Australian. Botanically, New Guinea is considered part of Malesia, a floristic region that extends from the Malay Peninsula across Indonesia to New Guinea and the East Melanesian Islands. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many tropical rainforest species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the conifers Podocarpus and the rainforest emergents Araucaria and Agathis, as well as tree ferns and several species of Eucalyptus. New Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: monotremes, three orders of marsupials, rodents and bats; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. The island's frogs are one of the most poorly known vertebrate groups, totalling 282 species, but this number is expected to double or even triple when all species have been documented. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral‚Äîthe latter equal to 75 percent of the world's known total. The entire coral area covers 18 million hectares off a peninsula in northwest New Guinea. New Guinea crocodile As of 2020, the Western portion of New Guinea, Papua and West Papua, accounts for 54% of the island's primary forest and about 51% of the island's total tree cover, according to satellite data. = Ecoregions =  Terrestrial  According to the WWF, New Guinea can be divided into twelve terrestrial ecoregions:Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J.

The first inhabitants, from whom the Papuan people are probably descended, adapted to the range of ecologies and, in time, developed one of the earliest known agricultures. Remains of this agricultural system, in the form of ancient irrigation systems in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, are being studied by archaeologists. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years.\\"The team also dated features consistent with the planting, digging, and tethering of plants and localized drainage systems to 10,000 years ago. Mounds constructed to plant water-intolerant plants such as bananas, sugarcane, and yams are dated to about 6,500 years ago.\\" \\"Was Papua New Guinea an Early Agriculture Pioneer?\\" By John Roach, for National Geographic News, June 23, 2003 Sugarcane was cultivated for the first time in New Guinea around 6000 BC.Sugar cane early origins and spread . Plant Cultures (2004-11-18). Retrieved on 2013-07-29. The gardens of the New Guinea Highlands are ancient, intensive permacultures, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm per year (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. Complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages are used in rotation on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Western agronomists still do not understand all of the practices, and it has been noted that native gardeners are as, or even more, successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.Diamond, Jared. Collapse. (German translation), Frankfurt 2005, p. 350. There is evidence that New Guinea gardeners invented crop rotation well before western Europeans.Diamond, Jared. Collapse. (German translation), Frankfurt 2005, p. 351. A unique feature of New Guinea permaculture is the silviculture of Casuarina oligodon, a tall, sturdy native ironwood tree, suited to use for timber and fuel, with root nodules that fix nitrogen. Pollen studies show that it was adopted during an ancient period of extreme deforestation. In more recent millennia, another wave of people arrived on the shores of New Guinea. These were the Austronesian people, who had spread down from Taiwan, through the South-east Asian archipelago, colonising many of the islands on the way. The Austronesian people had technology and skills extremely well adapted to ocean voyaging and Austronesian language speaking people are present along much of the coastal areas and islands of New Guinea. These Austronesian migrants are considered the ancestors of most people in insular Southeast Asia, from Sumatra and Java to Borneo and Sulawesi, as well as coastal new Guinea. = Precolonial history = Group of natives at Mairy Pass. Mainland of British New Guinea in 1885. Papuans on the Lorentz River, photographed during the third South New Guinea expedition in 1912‚Äì13. The western part of the island was in contact with kingdoms in other parts of modern-day Indonesia. The Negarakertagama mentioned the region of Wanin in eastern Nusantara as part of Majapahit's tributary. This has been identified with the Onin Peninsula, part of the Bomberai Peninsula near the city of Fakfak. The sultans of Tidore, in Maluku Islands, claimed sovereignty over various coastal parts of the island. During Tidore's rule, the main exports of the island during this period were resins, spices, slaves and the highly priced feathers of the bird-of-paradise. Sultan Nuku, one of the most famous Tidore sultans who rebelled against Dutch colonization, called himself \\"Sultan of Tidore and Papua\\", during his revolt in 1780s. He commanded loyalty from both Moluccan and Papuan chiefs, especially those of Raja Ampat Islands. Following Tidore's defeat, much of the territory it claimed in western part of New Guinea came under Dutch rule as part of Dutch East Indies. = European contact = The first European contact with New Guinea was by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the 16th century. In 1526‚Äì27, Portuguese explorer Jorge de Meneses saw the western tip of New Guinea and named it ilhas dos Papuas. In 1528, the Spanish navigator √Ålvaro de Saavedra also recorded its sighting when trying to return from Tidore to New Spain. In 1545, Spaniard √ç√±igo Ort√≠z de Retes sailed along the north coast of New Guinea as far as the Mamberamo River, near which he landed on 20 June, naming the island 'Nueva Guinea'.Collingridge, George The discovery of Australia, Sidney, 1895, pp.186‚Äì187 The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600 and shows it as 'Nova Guinea'. In 1606, Lu√≠s Vaz de Torres explored the southern coast of New Guinea from Milne Bay to the Gulf of Papua including Orangerie Bay, which he named Bah√≠a de San Lorenzo. His expedition also discovered Basilaki Island naming it Tierra de San Buenaventura, which he claimed for Spain in July 1606.Translation of Torres‚Äô report to the king in Collingridge, G. (1895) Discovery of Australia p.229-237. Golden Press Edition 1983, Gladesville, NSW. On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day Indonesia, and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain. The Netherlands controlled the western half of New Guinea, Germany the north-eastern part, and Britain the south-eastern part. A successive European claim occurred in 1828, when the Netherlands formally claimed the western half of the island as Netherlands New Guinea. In 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of New Ireland, the British colony of Queensland annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the United Kingdom revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when Germany claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of German New Guinea (also called Kaiser- Wilhelmsland). The first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902: Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with British New Guinea. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and headhunting within their respective territories.White, Osmar. Parliament of a Thousand Tribes, Heinemann, London, 1965 In 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \\"Territory of Papua\\"); and, in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. During World War I, Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the Territory of New Guinea, to be administered by Australia under a League of Nations mandate. The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942). Before about 1930, European maps showed the highlands as uninhabited forests. When first flown over by aircraft, numerous settlements with agricultural terraces and stockades were observed. The most startling discovery took place on 4 August 1938, when Richard Archbold discovered the Grand Valley of the Baliem River, which had 50,000 yet- undiscovered Stone Age farmers living in orderly villages. The people, known as the Dani, were the last society of its size to make first contact with the rest of the world.Diamond, Jared. The Third Chimpanzee. Harper Collins, 1993 A Japanese military map of New Guinea from 1943. = World War II = Australian soldiers resting in the Finisterre Ranges of New Guinea while en route to the front line. Netherlands New Guinea and the Australian territories were invaded in 1942 by the Japanese. The Australian territories were put under military administration and were known simply as New Guinea. The highlands, northern and eastern parts of the island became key battlefields in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II. Papuans often gave vital assistance to the Allies, fighting alongside Australian troops, and carrying equipment and injured men across New Guinea. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian and U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the New Guinea Campaign.\\"Remembering the war in New Guinea \\". Australian War Memorial. = Since World War II = Following the return to civil administration after World War II, the Australian section was known as the Territory of Papua-New Guinea from 1945 to 1949 and then as Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Although the rest of the Dutch East Indies achieved independence as Indonesia on 27 December 1949, the Netherlands regained control of western New Guinea. Map of New Guinea, with place names as used in English in the 1940s During the 1950s, the Dutch government began to prepare Netherlands New Guinea for full independence and allowed elections in 1959; the elected New Guinea Council took office on 5 April 1961. The Council decided on the name of West Papua for the territory, along with an emblem, flag, and anthem to complement those of the Netherlands. On 1 October 1962, the Dutch handed over the territory to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority, until 1 May 1963, when Indonesia took control. The territory was renamed West Irian and then Irian Jaya. In 1969, Indonesia, under the 1962 New York Agreement, organised a referendum named the Act of Free Choice, in which hand picked Papuan tribal elders reached a consensus to continue the union with Indonesia. There has been resistance to Indonesian integration and occupation, both through civil disobedience (such as Morning Star flag raising ceremonies) and via the formation of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM, or Free Papua Movement) in 1965. Amnesty International has estimated more than 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died as a result of government-sponsored violence against West Papuans.Report claims secret genocide in Indonesia ‚Äì University of Sydney Western New Guinea was formally annexed by Indonesia in 1969 From 1971, the name Papua New Guinea was used for the Australian territory. On 16 September 1975, Australia granted full independence to Papua New Guinea. In 2000, Irian Jaya was formally renamed \\"The Province of Papua\\" and a Law on Special Autonomy was passed in 2001. The Law established a Papuan People's Assembly (MRP) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua. The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans, raise the status of women in Papua, and to ease religious tensions in Papua; block grants were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $266 million in 2004. The Indonesian courts' enforcement of the Law on Special Autonomy blocked further creation of subdivisions of Papua: although President Megawati Sukarnoputri was able to create a separate West Papua province in 2003 as a fait accompli, plans for a third province on western New Guinea were blocked by the courts.King, 2004, p. 91 Critics argue that the Indonesian government has been reluctant to establish or issue various government implementing regulations so that the legal provisions of special autonomy could be put into practice, and as a result special autonomy in Papua has failed.Special Autonomy Issue ‚Äì ETAN The culture of inter-tribal warfare and animosity between the neighboring tribes are still present in New Guinea.

Thorner was a key figure in the formation of the American Association, which operated from 1882 to 1891. The 1882 Cincinnati Red Stockings season was the initial season of the franchise now known as the Cincinnati Reds. Biography In 1880, Thorner owned the Cincinnati Stars in the National League (NL); the team succeeded an early Cincinnati Reds franchise that operated during 1876‚Äì1879. The Stars finished in last place in their only season, then were expelled, \\"for failure to observe the rules, agreements and requirements of the league.\\" While the rest of the owners in the National League wanted changes banning Sunday baseball and beer selling at ballparks, Cincinnati objected, saying too much of the club's revenue would be lost. The expulsion of the Cincinnati franchise from the National League spurred the creation of the new American Association (AA). Thorner took ownership of the AA's Cincinnati Red Stockings franchise, which in 1882 won that league's first pennant. After the 1883 season, Thorner was succeeded as owner by Aaron S. Stern. Thorner then became owner of the Cincinnati Outlaw Reds of the Union Association (UA), which only operated in 1884. A son of Jacob and Rosalia (Baun) Thorner, he was born in 1848 in Hanover, Germany, and emigrated to the United States at a young age. He managed a brewery in Cincinnati, and in part got involved in baseball to help sell beer. Thorner was married; his wife, Pauline, died in March 1917. Eight months later, Thorner was in bankruptcy. Thorner died in Cincinnati on October 10, 1928; he was survived by a son, Bennett, and a daughter, Rose. He is buried in Cincinnati's United Jewish Cemetery.

Legend of the \\"Headless Woman\\"  Headless Woman placard at the closed pub The name of the Headless Woman public house name recalls the local legend of Grace Trigg who died in about 1664. She was a servant at nearby Hockenhull Hall, found hiding in a cellar there by Oliver Cromwell's parliamentarian soldiers after the royalist owners had fled. They tortured her to force her to reveal where the family valuables were hidden and, when she would not tell them, beheaded her in the attic, dragged her body downstairs and dumped it off one of the \\"Roman Bridges\\" (three medieval packhorse bridges on the River Gowy, still standing today at the end of Platts Lane in Hockenhull). Legend has it that, 250 years following her beheading, the inn's owners, after researching the story, ascended to the attic to discover the bloodstains were still present where she had been killed. For nearly 300 years, her ghost has been reported to wander the roads about Duddon, visiting the local park and bridges, and has been seen returning to her place of execution at the Headless Woman pub. Local farmers have reported seeing her ghost walking through rows of maize. She reportedly carries her severed head beneath her arm. The most common sightings of her ghost have been at the Roman Bridges in Hockenhull. In 2009, a professional paranormal investigation took place at the pub and bridges by local investigators to gather evidence of her ghost. With their instruments, they were able to detect unexplained sounds and many more mysterious pieces of evidence that could reveal her actual presence. The pub was demolished in 2014.

The region is dominated by the Deccan Peninsula (aka the Indian Peninsula), which occupies approx. 48.6% of the total area of the subcontinent. Geologically, the Indian subcontinent is related to the landmass that rifted from Gondwana and merged with the Eurasian landmass nearly 55 million years ago. Physiographically, it is the peninsular region in south- central Asia, delineated by the Himalayas in the north, the Hindu Kush in the west, and the Arakanese in the east. Geopolitically, the Indian subcontinent includes the coastal countries of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, the landlocked countries of Bhutan and Nepal, as well as the island countries of Maldives and Sri Lanka. The British Indian Ocean Territory is sometimes included in this subregion due to its proximity to Maldives. Nowadays, the term Indian subcontinent is often interchangeable with the term South Asia, although the latter may also include Afghanistan (a member state of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation). The United Nations geoscheme even includes Iran in its Southern Asia subregion.

Lukacs, \\"the Indian Subcontinent occupies the major landmass of South Asia.\\"John R. Lukacs, The People of South Asia: the biological anthropology of India, Pakistan, and Nepal, page 59, Plenum Press, 1984, This natural physical landmass in South Asia is the dry-land portion of the Indian Plate, which has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia. The Himalayas (from Brahmaputra River in the east to Indus River in the west), Karakoram (from Indus River in the east to Yarkand River in the west) and the Hindu Kush mountains (from Yarkand River westwards) form its northern boundary.Samiul Hasan, The Muslim World in the 21st Century: Space, Power, and Human Development, page 84, Springer Science & Business Media, 2012, Along the Eastern Hindu Kush lies the Afghanistan‚ÄìPakistan border.Vijay P. Singh, Pratap Singh and Umesh K. Haritashya, Encyclopedia of Snow, Ice and Glaciers, page 525, Springer Science & Business Media, 2011, The Western Fold Belt along the border (between the Sulaiman Range and the Chaman Fault) is the western boundary of the Indian Plate.S. Mukherjee, R. Carosi, P.A. van der Beek, B.K. Mukherjee and D.M. Robinson (ed.), Tectonics of the Himalaya, Geological Society of London, 2015, Given the difficulty of passage through the Himalayas, the sociocultural, religious and political interaction of the Indian subcontinent has largely been through the valleys of Afghanistan in its northwest, the valleys of Manipur in its east, and by maritime routes. More difficult but historically important interaction has also occurred through passages pioneered by the Tibetans. These routes and interactions have led to the spread of Buddhism out of the Indian subcontinent into other parts of Asia. And the Islamic expansion arrived into the Indian subcontinent in two ways, through Afghanistan on land and to Indian coast through the maritime routes on the Arabian Sea. Geopolitics The precise definition of an \\"Indian subcontinent\\" in a geopolitical context is somewhat contested as there is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or the Indian subcontinent., Quote: \\"To the east, Iran, as a Gulf state, offers a generally accepted limit to the Middle East. However, Afghanistan, also a Muslim state, is then left in isolation. It is not accepted as a part of Central Asia and it is clearly not part of the Indian subcontinent\\".Akhilesh Pillalamarri, South Asia or India: An Old Debate Resurfaces in California, The Diplomat, 24 May 2016; Whether called the Indian subcontinent or South Asia, the definition of the geographical extent of this region varies. In terms of modern geopolitical boundaries, the Indian subcontinent is constituted of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, besides, by convention, the island nation of Sri Lanka and other islands of the Indian Ocean, such as the Maldives.John McLeod, The history of India, page 1, Greenwood Publishing fGroup, 2002, Stephen Adolphe Wurm, Peter M√ºhlh√§usler & Darrell T.

Sharma, Geology of Nepal Himalaya and Adjacent Countries, page 14, Sangeeta Sharma Books, 1990, ASIN B0006EWSCI According to Chris Brewster and Wolfgang Mayrhofer, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan constitute the Indian subcontinent. According to Brewster and Mayrhofer, with Afghanistan and Maldives included it is more commonly referred to as South Asia.Chris Brewster and Wolfgang Mayrhofer, Handbook of Research on Comparative Human Resource Management, page 576, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2012, Afghanistan, despite often being considered as a part of South Asia, is usually not included in the Indian subcontinent. Even when some parts of Afghanistan are sometimes included in the Indian subcontinent as a boundary territory between Central Asia and northwestern parts of the Indian subcontinent, the socio-religious history of Afghanistan is more closely related to Turkic-influenced Central Asia.; The Maldives, a country consisting of a small archipelago southwest of the peninsula, is considered part of the Indian subcontinent. Some sources, including the International Monetary Fund, mention Maldives as a group of islands away from Indian subcontinent in a south-western direction.Ludwig Paul, Persian Origins, page 31, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2003, , \\"Maldive Islands which are scattered about the sea south-west of the Indian subcontinent, extending over more than 1,000km in a north-south direction.\\"Legal Department, International Monetary Fund, Maldives: Detailed Assessment Report on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism, page 15, International Monetary Fund, 2012, , \\"[Maldives] is the smallest Asian country in both population and land area.

Career A much travelled player during his career, Mardenborough's first club was Coventry City but was released after finishing his apprenticeship, joining Wolverhampton Wanderers. He struggled to make an impact on the first team. His only league goal for the club was the winner at Anfield in January 1984 against reigning champions Liverpool, who were en route to another League title as well as the 1983‚Äì84 European Cup, while Wolves would be relegated. After a loan spell at Cambridge United, Mardenborough joined Swansea City in July 1984. He was a popular figure in his single season at the club but was allowed to leave in a mass clear-out of players at the end of the year, staying in Wales to sign for Newport County. After two seasons in Newport he joined his third Welsh club in Cardiff City. He struggled to reproduce the same form he had previously shown, scoring just once in a 3-1 win over Torquay United, and was allowed to join Hereford United after one season. After leaving Hereford he spent time playing in Sweden for IFK √ñstersund before returning to England with Cheltenham Town. In 1990 he signed for Darlington where he held a regular first team place for several years, playing over 100 times for the club and helping them gain promotion back into the Football League. Leaving Darlington in 1993, he spent one year at Lincoln City before having a short spell at Colchester United and non- contract terms at Scarborough and Swansea. His second spell at Swansea would be his last in the Football League before dropping into non-league, playing in the Welsh Premier League for nearly ten years.

A growing, hip district, the area comprises parts of two of Louisville's oldest neighborhoods, Butchertown and Phoenix Hill. The district is home to schools, churches, large and small businesses and some of the city's oldest homes and businesses. A destination since Louisville's founding, Market Street has played host to a variety of businesses throughout the city's history that have drawn Louisvillians for generations to its addresses. The district is today well known for its galleries showcasing local, regional and national artists, unique specialty stores, antique shops and a growing number of upscale restaurants. While multiple art galleries are located in Louisville, they are especially concentrated in this district. Keeping with the sustainable culture of NuLu, many of its restaurants offer organic and locally sourced ingredients. The district also houses numerous architecture firms, antique stores, advertising and media agencies, a record label, film production group, publishing company, designers and more. History and architecture The area that is now NuLu was originally part of a Royal land grant to Col. William Preston for his service during the French and Indian War. In 1827, the area was annexed by the city of Louisville under the name of \\"Uptown\\". Around 1832, Market Street's eastern terminus was occupied by the Woodland Gardens, a green oasis of amusement and entertainment in the growing city that became a favorite gathering spot with German immigrants. The gardens themselves gave way to the Bourbon Stockyards when it closed in 1880, which helped fuel early growth of meat purveyors, tanners and other industries associated with the livestock trade, including the establishment of five Market Houses that populated the street. Two of these could be found in today's East Market District: the Shelby Market, between Campbell and Shelby Streets, and the Preston Market between Preston and Floyd Streets. From the early 1960s until the early 2000s, ten buildings on the 800 block of East Market area were owned by Wayside Christian Mission and used as the main housing campus for homeless women and families (men are still housed at a location on Jefferson Street). Eventually businesses in the area, led by antiques dealer Joe Ley, put pressure on the homeless shelter by opening a hearing process for Wayside's buildings to be added to the historic register, forcing Wayside to halt necessary renovations to its buildings. After months of stalled construction, Wayside Christian Mission sold its Market Street property and moved to a new location at 2nd and Broadway. Investors bought the ten properties for renovation, and hearings to add the buildings (some built as recently as the 1980s) to the historic register were called off. =Haymarket= The Haymarket area, which occupied most of the blocks around Jefferson, Market, Floyd and Preston streets, had a long and ethnically rich history, says University of Louisville archivist Dr. Tom Owen. \\"Dating as far back as the late 1800s an open-air market was operated here by vendors of varied national heritage,\\" he says. \\"At that time the Haymarket extended from Preston Street to Second Street and was the center for the majority of the produce traded in the city.\\" The first blow to the Haymarket's produce-market predominance came in 1955, when several fruit vendors and produce companies, including Horton Fruit, Al Campisano Fruit, and the Hill and Sloan, S&S;, and Clarence Mayfield produce companies formed the Louisville Produce Association and moved from East Liberty Street to Bishops Lane. The original Haymarket buildings were demolished in the late 1950s as part of an urban renewal initiative, but a new Haymarket was constructed in the 1960s and expanded several times over the next two decades. =Architecture and design= The creator of New York City's Central Park and father of Louisville's original parks system, Frederick Law Olmsted, designed two parks that replaced the original Market Houses, with the mini-parks themselves later replaced by traffic lanes. Designated in 1983 as part of the Phoenix Hill National Register Historic District, the area has a rich blend of architectural styles, ranging from pre-Civil War federal style town-homes and shotgun houses, to Italianate and Victorian residential and commercial structures, as well as large pre and turn of the 20th century buildings built to house Louisville's thriving businesses during the boom following the Civil War. Many of these buildings are today home to the many galleries, shops, restaurants and residents in the district. This includes Louisville's first commercial building seeking national LEED platinum certification as a green structure, known as The Green Building, located in a 110-year-old former dry goods store. What may be called the flagship building of NuLu is The Green Building. It was originally built in 1891 by Sternau's Dry Goods and was used as a dry goods store until it closed in 1949. It has since been used as a Goodwill Thrift Store (1956‚Äì1977) and a photography warehouse (1977‚Äì2006). In 2006, Gill and Augusta Holland purchased the building and began a dramatic renovation to try to achieve LEED Platinum Certification. The Green Building earned LEED Platinum Certification in 2010, becoming Louisville's first commercial LEED Platinum structure and Kentucky's first LEED Platinum adaptive reuse structure. Holland coined the term NuLu. Events Galleries, museums and other businesses in the East Market District as well as the West Main District are prominently featured during the monthly First Friday Hop, where free buses circle the downtown area with stops at most galleries and museums along its route. The NuLu East Market Festival is an annual event designed to showcase what the neighborhood and city of Louisville have to offer. Originally held September 26, 2009, the festival featured local vendors, food booths, beer and wine sales and a musical lineup featuring Ben Sollee. In popular culture Market Street often played host to Academy Award winning pioneer movie director, D. W. Griffith, a native of nearby Oldham County, Kentucky, whose family had moved to Louisville where D.W. began work for the Meffert Stock Company. This touring theater group was led by William H. Meffert, whose family had lived and worked in the 800 block of East Market Street from the 1850s through the 1960s. Writer and director Cameron Crowe chose the East Market District to shoot scenes for his 2005 film Elizabethtown, starring Orlando Bloom and Kirsten Dunst.

The film centers on a group of students surviving a zombie Nazi attack in the mountains of Norway. The premise of the film is similar to that of the draugr, a Scandinavian folkloric undead greedily protecting its (often stolen) treasures. NYAV Post has produced an English dub of this film for the home media release. Plot A woman, Sara, is being chased through the snows of Norway. She is ultimately cornered and eaten by zombies wearing World War II Nazi SS uniforms. Seven students on Easter vacation arrive at a small cabin near √òksfjord. The cabin is owned by Vegard, Sara‚Äôs boyfriend. The group begins to drink and party until a mysterious hiker arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during World War II, a force of Einsatzgruppe, led by Standartenf√ºhrer Herzog, occupied the area. For three years, the Nazis abused and tortured the local people. Near the end of the war, with Germany's defeat looming, the soldiers looted all the town's valuables. However, the citizens staged an uprising and ambushed them, killing many. The survivors, including Herzog, were chased into the mountains, and it was assumed that they all froze to death. The hiker then continues on his way. That night, Vegard wakes to a figure placing something beneath the floorboards of the cabin. He calls out, believing it to be Sara, but she ignores him and leaves. Vegard follows, and finds her outside covered in blood. Vegard suddenly jolts awake in his bed, revealing it was a dream. Meanwhile, the hiker has set up camp in the mountains and is eating dinner when he is disturbed by a noise outside. He investigates, and is attacked and killed by a zombie. The next morning, Vegard, out looking for Sara, discovers the hiker's body. He searches the area, falls through the snow into a cave, and is knocked unconscious. After sunset, Erlend finds an old wooden box filled with valuables and golden trinkets. They celebrate, and one of them pockets a gold coin. They eventually return the rest of the treasure to the box. Erlend goes to the outhouse where he and Chris have sex. Afterwards, Erlend returns to the cabin, and drops a gold coin. Chris is attacked by a zombie, and killed. The others leave the cabin to look for her, and find Sara's rucksack buried in the snow. Upon returning to the cabin, they are attacked. Erlend is killed in an attempt to defend the cabin, and the others secure the cabin. Vegard comes around in the cave, discovering German firearms and helmets, as well as Sara's severed head. He is attacked, but escapes to the surface, where he is confronted by a zombie. Vegard stabs the zombie in the eye, but is knocked from the cliff side by a second assailant. Vegard is bitten in the neck by the zombie, whilst the two hang from the cliff using an intestine as rope. He climbs back to the snowmobile, stitches his wounds, and mounts a MG34 machine gun to his snowmobile. Meanwhile, the remaining four students decide to split up. The two men, Martin and Roy, attempt to distract the zombies, while the two women, Hanna and Liv, run for the cars and go for help. En route to the cars, the girls are ambushed. Liv is knocked out by a zombie and awakens to him pulling out her intestines. Using an M24 stick grenade, she commits suicide and kills her assailant. Hanna leads a zombie to a cliff edge, breaks the ice, and they fall. The pair survive, and Hanna kills the zombie. Martin and Roy accidentally set fire to the cabin with Molotov cocktails. They escape, and arm themselves with power tools. More zombies attack, but they are aided by Vegard. During the attack Vegard is killed and Martin accidentally kills Hanna, who has returned to the cabin. Herzog arrives, leading a group of zombies. They attack, and Martin is bitten on the arm. To avoid becoming infected, he cuts off his arm with a chainsaw. After killing the remaining undead, Martin and Roy about to attack Herzog, who calls upon hundreds of zombies, that rise from under the snow. Whilst running from their attackers, Roy is hit in the head by a hammer, disemboweled by a tree branch, and killed by Herzog, who retrieves a watch from his pocket. Martin realises the zombies' intent, and retrieves the box from the ruined cabin. He returns the box to Herzog, and escapes to the car. There, he finds a gold coin in his pocket, just as Herzog smashes the window of the car. Cast Production In creating the film's Nazi zombies, writer and director Tommy Wirkola concluded that the best way to enhance the horror and disgust of standard zombies was to give them the Nazi element; he also used the historical backdrop of the Nazi occupation of Norway in developing the film's plot. In an interview, Wirkola said, \\"When we were about to sit down and write the actual script, we started thinking ‚ÄòWhat is more evil than a zombie‚Äô? A Nazi-zombie! We have a really strong war-history up in the north of Norway from World War Two, so it was fun to combine actual events with our own story. And you know Nazis have always been the ultimate villains in movies. Combine that with zombies and you really get something that no one would sympathise with.\\" Retrieved 20 Nov. 2010 Wirkola, who also appeared in a cameo as one of the zombie soldiers, said of his monsters, \\"I like to think of them as Nazi zombies. Nazis first, then zombies.\\"Retrieved 20 Nov. 2010 Even though a curse is alluded to in the beginning of the film, through the Nazi occupation and the subsequent burial grounds in the Norwegian mountains, it is not shown how the Nazis became zombies. However, Wirkola used the curse angle in the creation of the film's zombies. \\"We went for the old-fashioned ones where they're cursed. For me there are two types of zombie films: the curse and the plague or virus. So we wanted ours to be like a ghost story mixed with Indiana Jones.\\" Retrieved 20 Nov. 2010 The special effects make-up team responsible were Per Steinar Hoftun and Shino Kotani, both of Freax FX, and Steinar Kaarstein, of Effektmakeren.Effektmakeren, Dead Snow Retrieved 3 January 2011 The development crew also included Janne R√∏hmen (key make-up artist), Elisabeth Haugan, Gudmund Saksvik, Lene Bruks√•s, and Ragnhild Prestholt. Despite being set in √òksfjord, the film was shot in Alta and M√•lselv. Release The film was distributed by Euforia Film and released on 9 January 2009 in Norway. The U.S. premiere was held at the Sundance Film Festival, after which IFC Films purchased the U.S. distribution rights. The film received a limited release in the U.S. starting 19 June 2009, before its DVD release on 23 February 2010. Reception Dead Snow received mixed reviews from Norwegian critics, and was rated 3/6 by both Verdens Gang and Dagbladet. According to Manohla Dargis of The New York Times, director Tommy Wirkola, \\"who wrote the irrelevant screenplay with Stig Frode Henriksen, doesn‚Äôt just hit every horror beat; he pounds it to an indistinguishable pulp.\\" She highlighted the special effects team for acclaim for their \\"admirably disgusting\\" work. Stephen Witty of The Star-Ledger also commented positively on the film's visuals, and lauded Wirkola for his \\"steady hand with the action scenes\\", but identified the plot as the film's weakness. He accused the characters of lacking motivation, and for being \\"pretty much indistinguishable from one another.\\" He also had a problem with the ending.

Not to be confused with John Hall Maxwell. John Maxwell Hall, known most commonly as Maxwell Hall, was a British colonial administrator, judge and author who lived in and wrote about North Borneo (now Sabah). Early life and career Hall was born at Kempshot, near Montego Bay, Jamaica, on 7 October 1884, the son of Maxwell Hall and Agnes Gertrude Tullis. Hall was appointed West Coast Resident, North Borneo, in 1931. Before World War II and the Japanese invasion of Borneo, Maxwell Hall was a senior judge. Immediately after the war he was the Chief Advocate at some of the war crimes trials held at Labuan (holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel) and was attached to BBCAU, the British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit which was responsible for the running of North Borneo and other territories after the handover from Australian military control.http://cas.awm.gov.au/photograph/122770 .

If the caption is correct, the dates of Hall's tenure as Chief Justice are uncertain. A description by K. G. Tregonning In his 1960 book North Borneo, K. G. Tregonning described Maxwell Hall as > J. Maxwell Hall, a retired senior officer of the Chartered Company ... one > of the very few elderly Englishmen living in the Colony ... the grand old > man of the territory. > He lives in a two-storied wooden house, sparsely furnished, as befits his > Spartan physique, the owner of some fifty acres of land.

He lives as a South-East Asian squire, in > solitary contentment: but instead of becoming, after fifty years' service in > North Borneo, the grand old man of reminiscences ... this grizzled old live- > wire lives vigorously for the present and the future. He is perhaps one of > the most wide-awake and pertinent observers of the North Borneo of today > whom it was my privilege to meet. > He has written well of the past, in several hard-to-secure books published > locally, for he has an historian's bent, and he has contributed numerous > articles ...

At the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 1,553, reducing to 1,361 at the 2011 Census. There is an electoral ward with the same name whose population at the above census was 2,000. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the north, by the parishes of Hemyock, Luppitt, Combe Raleigh, Awliscombe, Broadhembury and Sheldon. History Dunkeswell is notable for having a busy small airfield, now Dunkeswell Aerodrome which was initially established as an American Navy air base during World War II, and continues to offer civil flight services to this day. The church, restored in 1868 from an older foundation, is of interest for its Norman font. Dunkeswell Eco Business Park, located near the aerodrome, was constructed to provide environmentally-friendly business space for start-up businesses, businesses who are considered to be at a disadvantage such as those run by younger owners or women, and businesses that have outgrown existing premises. Dunkeswell was the birthplace of the Canadian clergyman Henry Scadding. Climate The highest recorded temperature since 1990 was 28.3 ¬∞C on 2 and 8 July 2018 and the lowest was -7.8 ¬∞C on 2 January 1997. Dunkeswell Abbey The abbey is north of the village. The abbey was founded in 1201 by William Briwere as a Cistercian monastery and offshoot of Forde Abbey. The founder granted much property within Devon to the abbey. Around two years before his death in 1226, he entered the community and was eventually buried in front of the high altar of the abbey church. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries the abbey was closed in 1539 and granted to John Russell, 1st Baron Russell (1485‚Äì1555), later 1st Earl of Bedford, and was mostly demolished quickly, though a section remained in domestic use until the 19th century. In 1842, a parish church was built over part of the site. Some surviving fragments of monastery include the partial end wall of the cellarer's range and parts of a gatehouse. Some carved fragments survive within Holy Trinity Church which was built here in 1842 in Early English style.Pevsner, N. (1952) South Devon.

Volcanic activity  On January 4, 1641, a volcanic eruption covered much of Mindanao in darkness and sent showers of ash as far as Cebu and Panay. It was reported at the time as being from a small island \\"opposite the main river of Jolo\\" and the only possible source of eruption in Jolo is Mount Dakula near Lake Panamao.Some Philippine Volcanoes From recent studies, the eruption was finally attributed to Mount Parker in South Cotabato. A tsunami occurred in 1897, believed to have been caused by a local submarine eruption on September 21, 1897. It is possible this eruption was centered at Lake Seit, a volcanic maar with still active solfatara. Volcanoes in the Jolo Group are young and considered active on the probable eruptions above. Geology Rock types are predominantly basalt and andesite. Jolo Group is part of the Sulu Volcanic Arc, one of the two northeastern arms of the Sunda Plate which is in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt. It is an area of frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity. Like most volcanos in the former Sultanate of Sulu, the group is little studied scientifically.

It won Best Novel at the 1985 Whitbread Awards and the Guardian Fiction Prize. It tells the parallel stories of Nicholas Dyer, who builds seven churches in 18th- century London for which he needs human sacrifices, and Nicholas Hawksmoor, detective in the 1980s, who investigates murders committed in the same churches.The edition used for reference in this article is: Peter Ackroyd: Hawksmoor. With an Introduction by Will Self. Penguin Decades 80s, London 2010 Hawksmoor has been praised as Peter Ackroyd's best novel and an example of postmodernism.  Story  In the early 18th century, architect Nicholas Dyer is progressing work on several churches in London's East End. He is, however, involved in Satanic practices (something inculcated in him as an orphan), a fact which he must keep secret from all his associates, including his supervisor Sir Christopher Wren. This is all the more challenging since he indulges in human sacrifice as part of the construction of the buildings. Dyer's simmering contempt for Wren is brought closest to the surface in discussions they have concerning rationalism versus Dyer's own carefully disguised brand of mysticism. In the 20th century, DCS Nicholas Hawksmoor is called in to investigate a bizarre series of murders by strangulation that have occurred in and around the churches designed by Dyer. The murders are all the more mystifying since the murderer appeared to have left no identifying traces, not even fingerprints on the victims' necks. However the area is stalked by mysterious shadows, and it becomes clear that not only the weight of the investigation, but unseen forces from the past come to bear on Hawksmoor in a powerful, destructive manner.  Historical background  Peter Ackroyd stressed the fact that Hawksmoor is not a historical novel in the strict sense of the word: \\"I have employed many sources in the preparation of Hawksmoor, but this version of history is my own invention.\\"Peter Ackroyd: \\"Acknowledgements\\", p. 271 The novel \\"radically subverts the conventions of historical fiction\\" due to its idiosyncratic time structure.Peter Lewis (Daily Mail): \\"Peter Ackroyd Biography\\" http://biography.jrank.org/pages/4086/Ackroyd-Peter.html Nevertheless, Ackroyd uses historical characters, sites and occurrences in his book. Nicholas Dyer, the architect of the seven churches, is modelled on Nicholas Hawksmoor but doesn't share his death date (Dyer disappears in 1715, Hawksmoor died in 1736). As said in the novel, the Commission for Building Fifty New Churches, which had been established by an Act of Parliament in 1711, commissioned Hawksmoor to build six churches, all of which are dealt with in the novel: *Christ Church, Spitalfields, *St George's, Bloomsbury, *St Mary Woolnoth, *St George in the East, *St Anne's Limehouse, *St Alfege Church, Greenwich. The only fictional church in the book is Little St Hugh, venerating the historical Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. Hawksmoor was indeed assistant of Sir Christopher Wren, who is shown in the novel, historically correct, as profoundly interested in science and an active member of the Royal Society. Wren studied anatomy through dissection and vivisectionJ.A. Bennett: \\"The Mathematical Science of Christopher Wren\\". Cambridge University Press 1982, p.78 so that the dissection of a killed woman by Wren in the novel refers to actual actions by Wren but maybe not on human beings. It is not certain but possible that Christopher Wren visited Stonehenge.https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/programmes/stonehenge/day10.shtml The third historical character in the novel is Sir John Vanbrugh. Historical occurrences Ackroyd refers to are the Great Plague of London of 1665/1666 and the Great Fire of London of 1666. Bedlam was actually not only a lunatic asylum but also an attraction for paying guests in the 18th century. For a penny visitors could look into the patients' cells, view the freaks of the \\"show of Bethlehem\\" and laugh at their antics. In 1814 alone, there were 96,000 such visits.Lunatic London, BBC News Radio 4, 08 Aug. 2008 http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7537000/7537497.stm  Themes  Much of the novel is concerned with the disconnection between the 20th-century London of DCS Hawksmoor and its past, with Dyer's churches being both banal and mysterious to Hawksmoor. Wren's rationalism has succeeded in Hawksmoor's world, but we see Dyer's mysticism reassert itself in the form of murder and mystery. One critic has argued that Dyer's churches come to stand for the persistence of popular history and culture, in opposition to Wren's devotion to a rational progress driven by power and money.Link, Alex. \\"'The Capitol of Darknesse': Gothic Spatialities in the London of Peter Ackroyd's Hawksmoor.\\" Contemporary Literature. 45.3 (2004): 516-37. = Occultism = Nicholas Dyer believes in a syncretistic religion based on an utterly pessimistic view of man and world, represented by London: \\"In keeping with his Biblical belief that 'it was Cain who built the first City', Dyer leads us through the 'monstrous Pile of London' ‚Äì 'Nest of Death and Contagion', 'Capital City of the World of Affliction', 'Hive of Noise and Ignorance'.\\" Mirabilis, Nicholas Dyer's spiritual teacher, is the leader of an underground sect known as \\"Enthusiasticks\\". Mirabilis preaches that \\"Christ was the Serpent who deceiv'd Eve, and in the form of a Serpent entered the Virgin's womb\\" and that \\"Sathan is the God of this World and fit to be worshipp'd.\\" Among the sources he merges for his religion are the Ammonites, the Carthaginians, \\"the Straw Man of our Druides,\\" the Syrian Beel-Zebub, the Assyrians, the Jews, the Cabbala, Joseph of Arimathea, the Cathedral of Bath, the Temple of Moloch, Westminster and Anubis. The sect \\"sacrificed Boys since it was their Opinion that Humane life, either in desperate sicknesse or in danger of Warre, could not be secured unless a vyrgyn Boy suffered in stead.\\" A four-liner expresses the syncretist nature of Mirabilis's sect: Dyer develops his own belief in a reference between the pattern his churches form and the realm of evil and otherworldly. The pattern of his churches mirrors the \\"Proportion of the Seven Orders\\", i.e. Dyer literally tries to reproduce the pattern of the seven fixed stars that control the planetary spheres, thus hoping to submit to his will the seven planetary demons who control them. The exotic names Ackroyd gives to these demons bring to mind the seven maskim of Babylonian occultism. Due to the principles of sympathetic magic, Dyer reproduces with his churches the pattern of the seven planetary orders, and ensures that the pattern will be effective by concentrating within the septilateral figure the same kind of evil powers the seven fixed stars cast. \\"In other words, Dyer devises his churches as a huge talisman. This is why he builds them near ancient cemeteries and buries a sacrificial victim under their foundations, for, in his words: \\"when there are many Persons dead, only being buryed and laid in the Earth, there is an Assembling of Powers\\".\\"Susana Onega: \\"Metafiction and Myth in the Novels of Peter Ackroyd\\", Camden House 1999, p. 52f. Dyer believes that the ancients had an understanding of the \\"laws of harmonious proportions\\" used by the Universal Architect in the creation of the cosmos. Therefore, he studies ancient treatises on architecture. He builds his seven churches according to these principles and arranges them in a pattern imitating the Pleiades. In the end he disappears in his last church, like Hermes Trismegistus in his pyramid to begin his transmigration from body to body. Dyer undergoes a series of reincarnations both as victim and as murderer: each time he is reborn as a child or tramp, the new reincarnation is subsequently murdered by his \\"shadow\\" or dark emanation. In his last, 20th-century reincarnation, Dyer's evil emanation is embodied by the tramp called \\"The Architect\\", his good or rational side, by Nicholas Hawksmoor. The text expresses their final unification in the last paragraph of the novel when only one person speaks: What is said is separated by a wide blank on the page, indicating change of narrative level. The duality expressed in the change of narrative voices in the successive chapters is overcome by a first-person narration by somebody who is neither \\"The Architect\\" nor Hawksmoor.for the conclusions in this paragraph see: Susana Onega: \\"Metafiction and Myth in the Novels of Peter Ackroyd\\", Camden House 1999, p. 55f. = Enlightenment vs. occultism = Central to Hawksmoor is an ongoing debate between those who believe in enlightenment and rationalism and those who believe in occultism. The main protagonists of both sides are Sir Christopher Wren and Nicholas Dyer. \\"While Dyer argues that man cannot avoid the rage of evil spirits except by participating in evil, Wren and his fellow members of the Royal Society argue that man's reason will one day vanquish 'those wilde inhabitants of False worlds'. Dyer's is the voice of the most despairing (and exulting) anti- intellectualism, a throwback to medieval notions of the necessary primacy of the irrational; Wren's is the civilized voice in which we should like to believe.\\"New York Times, January 19, 1986 Joyce Carol Oates: \\"The Highest Passion is Terrour\\" https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/06/specials/ackroyd- hawksmoor.html Detective Hawksmoor begins as a member of the rationalist movement before resembling more and more Nicholas Dyer. = The nature of time = Hawksmoor transports an idea of time that is detrimental to the idea of time as a linearly progressing direction in time. \\"Ackroyd's aim is [...] to expose the linear character of time [...] for the fabrication that it is, and to propel his readers into a zone of full temporal simultaneity.\\"Will Self: \\"Introduction\\", p. vi This is achieved by parallelling numerous events happening in 18th-century and 1980s London thus indicating that Dyer and Hawksmoor experience more than only their own time. A symbol for this idea of a simultaneity of different layers of time is the uroborus: This feature of Ackroyd's novel has been seen in scholarly research as distinctive postmodern: \\"One of the features of postmodern novels is to organise narrative time in non-linear fashion and to present the story line as fragmented and disrupted.\\" This problematises reality by questioning scientific laws that governing time as well as social and cultural ideas of time that help to construct the western concept of reality. \\"There are no rational explanations for the time slips that occur between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries and, in some respects, the novel is a problematisation of that rational thinking that seeks causality and linearity.\\" The reader has to accept Ackroyd's treatment of time in order to understand the novel.Ana Sentov: \\"The Postmodern Perspective of Time in Peter Ackroyd's \\"Hawksmoor\\", relying heavily on Paul Smethurst: \\"The Postmodern Chronotope\\" (2000) Facta Universitas, Series: Linguistics and Literature Vol 7, November 2008 http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/lal/lal2009/lal2009-10.pdf Ackroyd himself called his concept of time in Hawksmoor \\"the perpetual present of the past\\" which \\"reemerges in the most unlikely ways.\\"EESE 8/1995, p. 176. Anke Sch√ºtze: \\"I think after More I will do Turner and then I will probably do Shakespeare.\\" An Interview with Peter Ackroyd http://webdoc.gwdg.de/edoc/ia/eese/articles/schuetze/8_95.html  Literary and philosophical influences  = Iain Sinclair's Lud Heat = Peter Ackroyd himself declared in the Acknowledgements that the stimulus for Hawksmoor was Iain Sinclair's poem Lud Heat: \\"I would like to express my obligation to Iain Sinclair's poem, Lud Heat, which first directed my attention to the stranger characteristics of the London churches.\\" Lud Heat (1975) is subtitled \\"a book of the dead hamlets\\". In Book One, \\"The Muck Rake\\", Sinclair devotes the first section to \\"Nicholas Hawksmoor, His Churches\\". Sinclair's thesis is that Hawksmoor planned his churches according to a strict \\"geometry of oppositions\\" producing a \\"system of energies, or unit of connection, within the city,\\" similar to those formed by \\"the old hospitals, the Inns of Courts, the markets, the prisons, the religious houses and the others\\". Sinclair argues that Hawksmoor arranged Christ Church, St George's in-the-East, and St Anne's, Limehouse, to form a triangle, while St George's, Bloomsbury, and St Alfege's, Greenwich, make up a pentacle star.Sinclair quoted in: Susana Onega: \\"Metafiction and Myth in the Novels of Peter Ackroyd\\", Camden House 1999. p. 44 Ackroyd did not follow Sinclair in really thinking that the churches form a distinctive and powerful pattern. Asked if the churches form a \\"symbol of freemasonry\\" he answered: \\"They don't really form a pattern. I made the pattern up.\\" = Psychogeography = Coined by the French Situationist Guy Debord, psychogeography originally referred to practices intended to expose the \\"urban geography falsified by the commercial and consumerist imperatives of late capitalism\\".Will Self: \\"Introduction\\", p. viii Debord undertook what he called d√©rives (literally 'drifts' across the city) that showed the various layers of place (historical, psychic, physical). For Ackroyd the 'd√©rive' is more like a \\"circumambulation through time as well as place: a widening gyre that exposes the very timelessness of this two-millennia-old city.\\"Will Self: \\"Introduction\\", p. ix The motif of the wanderer in the novel (tramps, vagrants, the restless wanderers Nicholas Dyer and Nicholas Hawksmoor) shows the influence of the psychogeographical theory in Hawksmoor. = William Blake and T. S. Eliot = Scholars have argued that the influences of William Blake and T. S. Eliot, both of whom are the subjects of Ackroyd biographies, are detectable in Hawksmoor. \\"The suggestion that Dyer was \\"more charmed by Milton's Hell than by his Paradise\\" and Hawksmoor's perception of his work as \\"that of rubbing away the grease and detritus which obscured the real picture of the world\\" echo passages in Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (35, 39).\\" \\"Dyer's obsession with physical corruption‚Äîin particular his disgust with sex‚Äîechoes the dysphoria of Eliot's most characteristic poems; his evocation of London as the Capital City of the World of Affliction and his scorn for the optimism of the Enlightenment strike an unmistakably Eliotic tone. Women are sluts and prostitutes. There is even a passing reference to hollow men.Hawksmoor, p. 15 Clearly Mr. Ackroyd shares Eliot's high regard for the language of the Renaissance and for Elizabethan and Jacobean drama.\\" \\"The basic principle at work here derives directly from Eliot's The Waste Land, a poem that juxtaposes the past with the present to show the continuity of history. [...] Those who are infected with the Black Death are called \\"Hollow Men\\", after the famous poem by Eliot. [...] Dyer's reflection on the quandaries of temporality virtually paraphrases a famous passage from Eliot's Four Quartets (1942) [...]: \\"What we call the beginning is often the end / And to make an end is to make an beginning.\\"Barry Lewis: \\"My Words Echo Thus: Possessing the Past in Peter Ackroyd\\", University of South Carolina, 2007, page 38  Structure and narrative mode, style, symbolism  = Structure and narrative mode = Hawksmoor is divided into a prologue and two untitled parts of six untitled chapters each. The odd-numbered chapters are first-person narrations by Nicholas Dyer in 18th-century London, while the even-numbered chapters take place in the 1980s and are told by an omniscient narrator, from the perspective of a tour guide through London and the murder victim Thomas Hill (chapter 2), the murder victim Ned (chapter 4) and Nicholas Hawksmoor (chapters 6, 8, 10 and 12). This clear pattern is deliberately obscured by a \\"pattern of echo and repetition\\". There are numerous parallels in characters, actions and descriptions between the chapters taking place in the 18th and those taking place in the 20th century. \\"They escape any effort at organization and create a mental fusion between past and present.\\" For example, the same fragments of popular songs, ballads, and poems are heard in the streets of London in both historical periods. This structure of repetitions and references underlines the peculiar theory of time the novel transports: \\"As we go on reading, we find more and more [...] reduplications of names, events, actions, and even identical sentences uttered by characters who live two centuries apart, until we are forced to conclude that, in the novel, nothing progresses in time, that the same events repeat themselves endlessly, and that the same people live and die only in order to be born and to live the same events again and again, eternally caught in what appears to be the ever-revolving wheel of life and death.Susana Onega: \\"Metafiction and Myth in the Novels of Peter Ackroyd\\", Camden House 1999, p. 46f. This interchangeability of characters and the circularity of events is stressed by the device of using the same words to end and to begin adjacent chapters. = Style = One of the most characteristic attributes of Hawskmoor is the first- person narration by Nicholas Dyer. Ackroyd here imitates unofficial 18th- century English (characterized by capitalization, Frenchified suffixes, irregular orthography) as can be found in Samuel Pepys's diary. Ackroyd read 18th-century texts for half a year in the British Library.Elizabeth Kolbert: \\"Wandering through History\\". Note on the Writing of Hawksmoor https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/06/specials/ackroyd-hawksmoor.html \\"texts about how to cure the gout, by a surgeon. Necromantic texts. I didn‚Äôt mind what it was as long as it was the right period.\\" The most important source was Samuel Johnson‚Äôs Dictionary: \\"Whenever I had to write a sentence about, say, someone looking out of the window, then I‚Äôd look up ‚Äòwindow‚Äô in Johnson, and there‚Äôd be all sorts of definitions, and phrases with the word in it, and these I also co-opted for the book\\".Patrick McGrath: \\"Peter Ackroyd\\": BOMB Magazine 26/Winter 1989 http://bombsite.com/issues/26/articles/1168 = Symbolism =  Shadow  The word \\"shadow\\" symbolizes not only Dyer's occult belief system but literally his dark side himself since he appears later on in the novel as a shadow killing people. Dyer admonishes his assistant Walter: \\"the art of shaddowes you must know well, Walter\\" because \\"it is only the Darknesse that can give trew Forme to our Work\\".Hawksmoor, p. 2 The name Dyer gives his occultism is \\"Scientia Umbrarum\\" (shadowy knowledge)Hawksmoor, p. 6 The murder victims all fall prey to an ominous figure called \\"the shadow\\".e.g. present-day Thomas Hill: Hawksmoor, p. 49, present-day Ned, p. 105  Stone  As symbol for the concept of eternity and overcome transitoriness Ackroyd chose the stone. Dyer becomes an architect after Mirabilis, his Satanic sect leader, prophesied to him: \\"You will build, he replied, and turn this Paper-work house (by which he meant the Meeting- place) into a Monument: let Stone be your God and you will find God in the Stone.\\"Hawksmoor, p. 60 For Dyer the monument of Stonehenge is an ancient place of occult powers, of a deep connection with a dark past because of its stones: \\"The true God is to be venerated in obscure and fearful Places, with Horror in their Approaches, and thus did our Ancestors worship the Daemon in the form of great Stones.\\"Hawksmoor, p. 69 The stones contain for ever the pain of the workers who erected them, Dyer can feel this and more since human concepts and suffering has eternalized in the stones: \\"And when I lean'd my Back against that Stone I felt in the Fabrick the Labour and Agonie of those who erected it, the power of Him who enthrall'd them, and the marks of Eternity which had been placed there.\\"Hawksmoor, p. 74  Animals  One of Satan's names, Beelzebub, can be translated as \\"Lord of the Flies\\". Thus flies and other insects (spiders, lice) are recurrently used as symbols in \\"Hawksmoor\\". Already at the very beginning of the novel Dyer advises his assistant Walter to \\"show how the Lines [of the church plans] necessarily beare upon one another, like the Web which the Spider spins in a Closet\\",Hawksmoor, p. 1 thus associating the churches with an insect. Dyer's pessimistic view of the world is stressed by his view of it as a \\"dunghill\\" attracting flies: \\"I saw the Flies on this Dunghil Earth, and then considered who their Lord might be.\\"Hawksmoor, p. 16 Ironically the occultist Dyer compares the rationalistic members of the Royal Society with flies: \\"The Company buzzed like Flies above Ordure\\".Hawksmoor, p. 172 Another animal often associated with Satan and evil is the black cat. Thus a black cat is often heard or seen near the places where the tramp called \\"The Architect\\" makes his appearance. It is also associated with Mirabilis and his Satanic sect (\\"I fell into a sound Sleep, before I did so, I seemed to hear screeching, much like that of a Catte.\\")Hawksmoor, p. 20 It is a cat which leads Thomas Hill to the church where he gets strangled.Hawksmoor, p. 43  Role as postmodern novel  Critics and scholars have identified Hawksmoor as a postmodern novel.\\"Attempts to understand Hawksmoor as a postmodernist novel (Herman, De Lange) are set in perspective by Fokkema's argument that the British reading public responds to both international postmodernist and indigenous features in the writing of Ackroyd.\\" in: Twentieth Century Literature, Winter 2000 issue: Edward J. Ahearn, Professor of Comparative Literature and French Studies, Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island: \\"The Modern English Visionary: Peter Ackroyd's Hawksmoor and Angela Carter's The Passion of New Eve\\" http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0403/is_4_46/ai_75141044/ Ackroyd uses typical postmodern techniques, such as playfulness, intertextuality, pastiche, metafiction and temporal distortion. Peter Ackroyd himself does not see Hawksmoor as an expressly postmodern novel but prefers the term \\"transitional writing\\": Ackroyd plays with the genre of the detective story by using the form of the detective novel but changing the premises in such a way that the typical course of events (crime‚Äìlogical investigation‚Äìsolution) is impossible. \\"Suffice it to say that in a detective story whose strange outcome is reincarnation, fiction and history fuse so thoroughly that an abolition of time, space, and person is, one might say, inflicted on the reader.\\" Thus Hawksmoor can be called an anti-detective novel:  Reception and awards  Hawksmoor won two of the most prestigious British literary awards: the Guardian Fiction Prize and the Whitbread Novel Award. It was reviewed predominantly positively after publication. Joyce Carol Oates for The New York Times wrote: Peter S. Prescott, in Newsweek, defined it \\"a fascinating hybrid, a tale of terrors that does double duty as a novel of ideas\\".Answers.com http://www.answers.com/topic/peter-ackroyd-children-s-author-illustrator Patrick McGrath for BOMB magazine, stated that \\"Hawksmoor is [Ackroyd's] best fiction to date. It is a dark, complex novel narrated in part in perfect 17th- century prose.\\" Peter Lewis wrote for the Daily Mail: Although most reviews were positive there were voices which criticized Hawksmoor as confusing or morally repellent, particularly in sexual terms. (Hollinghurst, King, Maddox). While most critics especially praised Ackroyd's imitation of 18th-century English there were critical voices here, for example Cedric D. Reverand II, who wrote that \\"Ackroyd's notion of the appropriate style seems at times idiosyncratic and more Jacobean‚ÄìMannerist than late seventeenth‚Äìearly eighteenth century\\".Reverand quoted in: Susana Onega: Metafiction and Myth in the Novels of Peter Ackroyd, Camden House 1999, p. 45 Hawksmoor has become the subject of numerous studies, especially on Postmodernism. Adriana Neagu and Sean Matthews wrote in 2002 that: Hawksmoor is praised for Ackroyd's \\"convincingly 18th-century prose\\" in the 2006 edition of The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English.Dominic Head (ed.): The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English. Cambridge University Press. Third Edition 2006 It was chosen by Penguin in 2010 as one of five novels representing the 1980s in their series Penguin Decades. Peter Ackroyd himself is a harsh critic of his novel:  Adaptation  The South Bank Show covered Hawksmoor in 1985.

PDO is an organic compound with many commercial applications. Conventionally, PDO is produced from crude oil products such as propylene or ethylene oxide. In recent years, however, companies such as DuPont are investing in the biological production of PDO using renewable feedstocks such as corn.http://www.chem.uu.nl/brew/BREWsymposiumWiesbaden11mei2005/WEBSITEBrewPresentations51105.PDFhttp://www.azom.com/News.asp?NewsID=8862 History In May 2004, DuPont and Tate & Lyle announced that they would start up a joint venture to build a facility that produces polymers from renewable feedstock instead of petrochemicals. In particular, their goal was to design a fermentation system that converts corn sugar into PDO (propanediol manufactured in this way is referred to in the media as \\"BioPDO\\"). They argue that using such a bioprocess is more energy efficient than conventional petrochemical processes (conversion of propylene into propanediol) because the bioprocess has four advantages over the conventional process: smaller environmental footprint, lower operating costs, smaller capital investment, and greater sustainability due to use of renewable corn feedstock. Process BioPDO can be made by the bacterial fermentation of glycerol. However, DuPont has managed to engineer a strain of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common bacterium, to allow industrial-scale production of 1,3-propanediol by fermentation of glucose. After the E. coli produce sufficient BioPDO product, DuPont uses a method to separate the BioPDO from the cellular broth that comes out of the bioreactor consisting of four steps: microfiltration and ultrafiltration, ion exchange, flash evaporation, and distillation. =Filtration= The first of the two filtration steps, microfiltration, is used to remove the cells from the reactor broth. Ceramic filters are used because, although expensive, they can last for five to ten years. High temperatures have been found to increase the flux of liquid across the microfiltration membrane, so a minimum temperature of is specified. A series of three ultrafiltration membranes are used to filter out proteins with a molecular weight of 5,000 Daltons and higher. The feed pressure to the microfiltration membrane is typically 65 psia with a transmembrane pressure drop of 40 psia. The feed pressure to each ultrafiltration membrane is 60 psia. Using these feed pressures and temperatures, typical transmembrane liquid fluxes are 108 LMH (liters per hour per square meter) for the microfiltration membrane, and 26 LMH for the ultrafiltration membrane. =Ion exchange= The next step of the scheme, ion exchange, removes impurities that cause the downstream polymer product to turn yellow. Four ion exchange columns in series are used to remove these impurities, and they are arranged in the following order: # Strong acid cationic exchanger # Strong base anionic exchanger # Strong acid cationic exchanger # Strong base anionic exchanger The first cationic exchanger replaces the divalent cations in solution with hydrogen ions. The first anionic exchanger replaces the anions in solution with hydroxide ions. The second cationic and anionic exchangers further reduce ion levels in solution. Note that hydrogen ions (H+ spontaneously react with hydroxide ions (OH‚àí) to form water (H2O): :H+ \\\\+ OH‚àí ‚Üí H2O =Flash evaporation= After the ion exchange step, excess water is produced from the hydrogen and hydroxide ions, and that can dilute the product to less than 10% concentration by weight. By sending the dilute solution to an evaporation system under vacuum, water will flash out of the solution into low-pressure steam, leaving a propanediol solution with up to 80% propanediol by weight. The low-pressure steam is then compressed to a higher pressure and temperature, and afterward directed to the outer casing of the flash evaporation unit to heat the system. =Distillation= The final step of the scheme, distillation, comprises two distillation columns, and optionally four distillation columns. The three main types of chemicals in the fluid at this stage of the separation are water, BioPDO, and impurities such as glycerol, sugars, and proteins. Of the three chemicals water has the lowest boiling point (see the water, 1,3-propanediol, and glycerol articles for boiling point information), so it is removed as distillate in the first column. The bottoms of the first column is then sent to a second column, where BioPDO is removed as distillate because of its lower boiling point. Both columns operate under low pressure (55 mm Hg in the first column; 20 mm Hg in the second column) to lower the boiling points of the distillate and bottoms streams, thereby using a lower pressure steam than that for atmospheric columns. At this point, the BioPDO stream has 99% purity. If the BioPDO is to be used for polymer production, however, then greater purity is required. To achieve greater purity, the BioPDO distillate of the second column is sent to a hydrogenation reactor to convert the remaining polymer-coloring impurities into non-coloring chemicals. The effluent of the reactor is then sent to a second set of two distillation columns that operate the same way as the first set of columns. The BioPDO distillate of the fourth distillation column has a purity of 99.97%, which is able to meet polymer- and fiber-grade standards. Energy efficiency of process According to DuPont, the BioPDO process uses 40% less energy than conventional processes. DuPont also claims that the bioprocess reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, and that the production of one hundred million pounds of BioPDO annually \\"saves the energy equivalent of fifteen million gallons of gasoline per year\\". Because of DuPont and Tate & Lyle's success in developing a renewable BioPDO process, the American Chemical Society awarded the BioPDO research teams the \\"2007 Heroes of Chemistry\\" award.

These include the Tangier-Mediterranean port (\\"Tanger-med\\") and its industrial parks, a 45,000-seat sports stadium, an expanded business district, and a renovated tourist infrastructure. Agriculture in the area of Tangier is tertiary and mainly cereal. The infrastructure of this city of the strait of Gibraltar consists of a port that manages flows of goods and travellers (more than one million travelers per annum) and integrates a marina with a fishing port. Artisanal trade in the old medina (old city) specializes mainly in leather working, handicrafts made from wood and silver, traditional clothing, and shoes of Moroccan origin. The city has seen a fast pace of rural exodus from other small cities and villages. The population has quadrupled during the last 25 years (1 million inhabitants in 2007 vs. 250,000 in 1982). This phenomenon has resulted in the appearance of peripheral suburban districts, mainly inhabited by poor people, that often lack sufficient infrastructure. History At the turn of the 20th century, Tangier produced almost no manufactures for export. Trade included trinkets for tourists; oxen, chickens, meat, and eggs for Gibraltar and Spain; and some blankets and slippers for Egypt.. It was, however, a major center for imports to its own international community, as well as northern Morocco as far as Meknes and Fez. Native tangerines were not sufficient for local consumption, and many were brought in from Tetuan. Tourism Street in Medina (Old City) A view of Tangier Bay at sunset as seen from the Malabata suburb. Tangier's economy relies heavily on tourism. Seaside resorts have been increasing with projects funded by foreign investments. Real estate and construction companies have been investing heavily in tourist infrastructures. A bay delimiting the city center extends for more than seven kilometers. Hamptons International and Emaar have identified Tangier as a major growth area and recently unveiled Tinja, a resort on the Atlantic, twenty minutes drive from Tangier and an hour from Spain. Tangier will be made up of six distinctive communities with a hill-top community as the centre-piece. Port of Tangier. Typically, the resort features a wealth of recreational and leisure facilities as well as a beach and spa hotel. With this development, Emaar aims to capitalize on the rental market; a sound strategy with a current lack of quality housing available and also no tax on rental income for purchasers for five years. In terms of pricing, on the higher-end of the market, pricing is anywhere between US$1,575 and US$4,726 per sq m built, depending on the specifications and services which remains competitive with Europe and other Middle Eastern destinations\\". Development Before 1956, Tangier was a city with international status. It had a great image and attracted many artists. After Morocco regained control over Tangier, this attention slacked off. Investment was low and the city lost its economic importance. But when Mohammed VI became king in 1999, he developed a plan for the economic revival of Tangier. The economic boom in the city caused a population boom as well. Upgrading social services and infrastructure has become a necessity. A large-scale development program was created, requiring MAD 2.46bln (about $320mln) to upgrade the city. It was approved in August 2008 under the chairmanship of King Mohammed VI. The upgrading program will benefit mainly the popular and suburban neighborhoods of the city in order to guarantee harmony in the urban setting by reinforcing basic infrastructures and providing social equipment to the environment- related projects. This colossal investment is meant to enable Tangier to hook up again with its prestigious image, and cope with the economic development triggered in the northern region, as huge, structuring projects are launched here and there on the Mediterranean coasts of the kingdom. Tangier Medina will benefit from $11.5mln to revamp the road grid, better public transportation, improve traffic and reinforce social equipment. =Infrastructure= New developments include a new airport terminal, a soccer stadium with seating for 45,000 spectators, a high-speed train line and a new highway that connects the city with Rabat and Casablanca. Additionally, a new train station was constructed, called Tanger-Ville. The high-speed \\"TGV\\" rail linking Tangier with Casablanca will be operational by 2018, and is expected to carry 8 million passengers the first year. This TGV line will require a USD 2.7Bn investment. 18 TGV cars are needed for this project that will contribute to reducing the duration of the trip between the two economic poles to 2h10 instead of 4h40 now. Tangier is also home to a highly productive automobile plant run by Renault. The factory produced 100,000 vehicles in 2013, and will eventually produce 400,000 annually. Cars produced at the plant are exported to destinations around the world, including France, Germany, and Turkey. Tangier Exportation Free Zone The creation of the TEFZ increased the economic output of the city significantly. The TEFZ is a protected free trade environment where companies from around the world can operate tax-free. It covers an area of 345 hectares. It incorporates a vast container port at the junction of the biggest maritime routes in the world with the capacity to handle both cargo and passenger ships. The free zone allowed Tangier to develop into an industrial pillar of the country.http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=23641 Tangier-Med Port of Tangier-med The Tangier-Med is the largest port in Africa and one of largest in the mediterranean sea. The complex has important economic effects in terms of jobs, creation of added value and foreign investment. Its particular position on the Straits of Gibraltar, at the crossing of two major maritime routes, and 15 km from the European Union enables it to serve a market of hundreds of millions of consumers through the industrial and commercial free zones which will be run by well-known private operators. It also wins part of the strong growth market of container transshipment and has become the leading hub for cereal transshipment, a facility which is non- existent in the north-west African region at present. The complex is implemented, coordinated and managed by TMSA, a private company with public prerogatives, operating under an agreement with the State and interacting with the different ministries involved.

The two-storey pavilion was commissioned by Sultan Abd√ºlaziz (reigned 1861-1876) as a hunting lodge, designed by the architect Sarkis Balyan in the neo-baroque style and completed in 1870. The pavilion, perched atop a steep hill, is one of the two lodges of its art within the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Park, the other one being the √áadƒ±r Pavilion (). It is located at the north side of the wall separating Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. There are also two watching and resting pavilions in the grove being the rear garden of √áƒ±raƒüan Palace from the Abd√ºl Aziz I period. The origin of the name comes from the executive use of limestone from Malta, which is the prominent material used.  Architecture  Marble fountain pool in the lower salon adorned with carved swan and fish figures. One of the salons on the second floor Malta Kiosk is an example of westernised architecture of the 19th century. The building was constructed by Sarkis Balyan and his brothers. During the Abd√ºl Mecid I period, the architects have been influenced by the European architecture and motifs of nature, flowers, fruits and hunting animal figures have been widely used on the walls. Round marble columns, terraces, bedrooms, wooden and crystal halls have features like neo-classical, neo-Islamic and neo-Ottoman characteristics. The arches in S and C shapes originated from the Rococo style. Columns, palmets or sea shells have been added to the keystones of the arches. The baroque style of the 19th century has been reflected with oval windows, fluted cornices, flushed columns with small tower on ends. The vertical and horizontal elements have been balanced in the Empire style symbolising the Napoleonic period under the influence of Egyptian and Roman architecture. The facades of the building on each side, painted in yellow and green, consists of three parts with a large center section flanked by two smaller. Main elements of the facades are triple, tall but narrow, round- arched windows. At the second floor on the side overlooking the Bosporus are also balconies. The building has four doors in total. The waterside entrance opens onto a large hall. On both sides of the entrance hall, two staircases rise to upper floor. A large chandelier hangs from a dome-shaped ceiling, which is opulently decorated with curving branches and clusters of various flower motifs. The lower salon contains a big marble fountain and a marble pool in the center decorated with carved swan and fish figures. Between the hall and the salon, there are five-tier marble fountains again with carved swan figures. Two marble columns erects here to the ceiling. The salon on the upper level is flanked with two large and one small-sized rooms. The large salons on both floors are equipped with a carved marble fireplace worked with colorful flowers. Oil paintings with landscape themes beautify the walls of the salons. Two rooms on the upper floor are decorated with flower motifs. There are balconies on the second floor facing the sea.  Witness to political incidents  When Sultan Abd√ºlaziz was dethroned in 1876, his nephew Murad V (reigned May 30-August 31, 1876) was elevated to the throne. However, he was in turn deposed only after 93 days on the grounds that he was mentally ill, and was replaced by his brother, Abdul Hamid II (reigned 1876-1909). Abdul Hamid II detained Murad V in the Malta Pavilion. Midhat Pasha, grand vizier and statesman, was ordered by Sultan Abdul Hamid II to be arrested the second time in 1881. Although escaped in the first instance, Midhat Pasha returned a short time later claiming a fair hearing. The trial was held in the nearby √áadƒ±r Pavilion, and lasted three days in June that year, during which he was tortured in the basement. The trial of Midhat Pasha took place in a tent behind the pavilion.  Redevelopment  View onto the Bosphorus from the terrace at dawn Following the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, the Malta Pavilion, as many of Ottoman imperial buildings, stood unused and was neglected over a long period. In 1979, the Touring and Automobile Club of Turkey (TTOK) under its CEO √áelik G√ºlersoy signed an agreement with the City of Istanbul to restore and preserve specific imperial residences, and to run them as public premises. Malta Pavilion was the first restoration work accomplished. The exterior walls were repainted green with white trim, and the interiors were restored to their former glory. Furnishings, chandeliers and paintings were collected to fit the style of the rich neo-baroque building. Opened to the public in 1982, the Malta Pavilion was run as a cafeteria and restaurant by the TTOK until the lease license expired, and the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul did not renew it. From 1997 until 2003, it was operated by the tourism company Beltur of the Metropolitan Municipality. Today, the premise is being run by a private company. In the restaurant and cafeteria on two floors, up to 150 guests can be served.  Dessert  \\"Malta K√∂≈ük√º\\" is also the name of a cake in the Turkish cuisine prepared with the loquat fruit ().

The case itself concerns the possible sale of potatoes by a Forfar potato merchant to an international potato merchant in Amsterdam, on 29 November 1977. The Forfar merchant telexed an offer (open for acceptance till 17.00 hrs., 30 November 1977) to sell potatoes to the international merchant, subject to certain conditions regarding delivery dates and sizes. By telex dated 30 November 1977, the international merchant purported to accept the offer, subject to certain additional conditions. Following a telephone conversation between the parties to clarify the position, the international merchant by further telex dated 30 November 1977, sent within the time-limit, again purported to accept the original offer but requested that their conditions telexed in their first telex, should be given consideration. The Forfar merchant did not supply the potatoes and was sued for damages. The question arose as to whether there was a valid contract with consensus in idem ever constituted between the parties. The sheriff after a proof before answer, held that #there was no contract between the parties, and #the pursuers failed to prove any loss. The pursuers appealed to the Court of Session where it was held that on the making of a qualified acceptance and counter-offer, the original offer falls and that on the failure to obtain the terms requested in the counter-offer, the party cannot fall back on and accept the original offer.

Although other studies have shown much higher figures.http://www.allbusiness.com/africa/1035405-1.html Investment by region =Investment from the EU= Most of the FDIs injected in Morocco came from the European Union with France, the major economic partner of the north African kingdom, topping the list with investments worth $1.86bln, followed by Spain ($783mln), the report said. The influx of European countries in Morocco's FDI represents 73.5% of the global amount received in 2007, according to the report which was presented by Souraya Ouali of the Direction of Investments. =Investment from the Arab World= 19.3% of the investments came from Arab countries, whose share in Morocco's FDI showed a marked rise, as they only represented 9.9% of the entire FDIs in 2006. A number of Arab countries, mainly from the Persian Gulf are involved in large-scale projects in Morocco, including the giant Tanger Med port on the Mediterranean. Morocco remains the preferred destination of foreign investors in the Maghreb region (Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia), with a total of $13.6mln between 2001 and 2007, which puts it largely on the top of the list. The Persian Gulf countries are investing heavily in Morocco, particularly in tourism and real estate. Construction is evident everywhere. These investments reflect the strong diplomatic relations between Morocco and the regimes in the Persian Gulf countries. Some analysts would add the Sunni affinity as another factor, but above all, it is the liberalized economy and the economic reforms in Morocco that appear to be attracting most of the investors from the Persian Gulf region. The trend of heavy Persian Gulf investments in Morocco came in the wake of 9/11, when GCC countries began to invest more in the Arab world. Due to the oil prices, which climbed about 400% in eight years, member countries of the GCC (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman) accumulated considerable liquidity that has triggered the drive for diversification.http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=190 *The United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been a major player in Morocco's development. While early investments were primarily in construction and tourism, recent investments have been directed at newer areas such as information technology, agriculture, transportation, telecommunications, automobile and aviation development. The amount of the investments is becoming of great significance for the Moroccan economy Analysts estimate that the potential of investment of the Persian Gulf countries is about $500 billion, and Morocco could conceivably attract no less than 20 billion dollars of that amount. Investment per sector In terms of sectors, tourism has the lion's share with $1.55bln, that is 33% of the total FDIs, followed by the real estate sector and the industrial sector, with respectively $930mln and $374mln. Moroccan expatriates' share of the FDI stood at $92mln in 2007, up from $57mln in 2006, and they touch mainly the sectors of real estate, tourism and catering, according to the report. Recent developments Expectations for 2008 are promising, noting that 72 projects were approved for a global amount of $9.28bln. These are due to open 40,023 direct job opportunities. Morocco is also a source of foreign investments. In 2007, it has injected $652mln in projects abroad, which put the kingdom in the third position in Africa, UNCTAD said. Morocco has become an attractive destination for European investors thanks to its relocation sites \\"Casashore\\" and \\"Rabatshore\\", and to the very rapid cost escalation in Eastern Europe, Vice chairman of the \\"Groupe d'impulsion √©conomique France-Maroc\\" (GIEFM) said in October 2008. He stressed that the offshoring sector in Morocco is of great importance as it creates high-level jobs that are generally accompanied by an influx of Moroccan immigrants. He underlined, however, that human resources remain the major concern for companies seeking to gain a foothold in Morocco. In this regard, he deemed \\"important\\" the decision of the Moroccan government to accelerate training in the required disciplines. Reforms In a bid to promote foreign investments, Morocco in 2007 adopted a series of measures and legal provisions to simplify procedures and secure appropriate conditions for projects launching and completing. Foreign trade minister, Abdellatif Maazouz cited that these measures include financial incentives and tax exemptions provided for in the investment code and the regional investment centres established to accompany projects. These measures combined with actions carried out by the Hassan II Fund for Development increased foreign investments in Morocco by $544,7 mln in 2007. 20% of these investments came from Islamic countries.

Although Milton wrote earlier poetry, his influence is largely grounded in his later poems: Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and Samson Agonistes. Miltonic verse Although Milton was not the first to use blank verse, his use of it was very influential and he became known for the style. When Miltonic verse became popular, Samuel Johnson mocked Milton for inspiring bad blank verse, but he recognized that Milton's verse style was very influential.Greene 1989 p.27 Poets such as Alexander Pope, whose final, incomplete work was intended to be written in the form,Brisman 1973 pp. 7‚Äì8 and John Keats, who complained that he relied too heavily on Milton,Keats 1899 p. 408 adopted and picked up various aspects of his poetry. In particular, Miltonic blank verse became the standard for those attempting to write English epics for centuries following the publication of Paradise Lost and his later poetry.Bate 1962 pp. 66‚Äì67 The poet Robert Bridges analyzed his versification in the monograph Milton's Prosody. Christian epic Milton was not the first to write an epic poem on a Christian theme. There are some well-known precursors: *La Battaglia celeste tra Michele e Lucifero (1568), by Antonio Alfani; *La Sepmaine (1578), by Guillaume Du Bartas; *La Gerusalemme liberata (1581), by Torquato Tasso; *Angeleida (1590), by Erasmo di Valvasone; *Le sette giornate del mondo creato (1607), by Tasso; *De la creaci√≥n del mundo (1615), by Alonso de Acevedo. He was, on the other hand and according to Tobias Gregory: > the most theologically learned among early modern epic poets. He was, > moreover, a theologian of great independence of mind, and one who developed > his talents within a society where the problem of divine justice was debated > with particular intensity.Gregory 2006 p. 178 He is able to establish divine action and his divine characters in a superior way to other Renaissance epic poets, including Ludovico Ariosto or Tasso.Gregory 2006 pp. 178‚Äì179 In Paradise Lost Milton also ignores the traditional epic format, which started with Homer, of a plot based on a mortal conflict between opposing armies with deities watching over and occasionally interfering with the action. Instead, both divinity and mortal are involved in a conflict that, while momentarily ending in tragedy, offers a future salvation. In both Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, Milton incorporates aspects of Lucan's epic model, the epic from the view of the defeated. Although he does not accept the model completely within Paradise Regained, he incorporates the \\"anti-Virgilian, anti-imperial epic tradition of Lucan\\".Quint 1993 pp. 325‚Äì326 Milton goes further than Lucan in this belief and \\"Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained carry further, too, the movement toward and valorization of romance that Lucan's tradition had begun, to the point where Milton's poems effectively create their own new genre\\".Quint 1993 p. 340 Greek tragedy Milton defined his views of Greek tragedy in the preface to Samson Agonistes. His understanding of what would make an appropriate Christian tragedy combines aspects of Greek tragedy with Hebrew scripture, which alters both forms. Here again he was not an innovator, following for example the Adamus Exul (1601) of Hugo Grotius, and the Adamo (1615) of Giovanni Battista Andreini. Milton believed that the Bible was a precursor to the classical forms relied on by the Greeks and Romans, and that the Bible accomplished what the Greeks and Romans wished in a more suitable manner.Teskey 2006 p. 144 In his introduction, Milton discusses Aristotle's definition of tragedy and sets out his own paraphrase of it to connect it to Samson Agonistes:Lewalski 2003 p. 19 > Tragedy, as it was anciently composed, hath been ever held the gravest, > moralest, and most profitable of all other poems: therefore said by > Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge the > mind of those and such-like passions, that is to temper and reduce them to > just measure with a kind of delight, stirred up by reading or seeing those > passions well imitated. Nor is nature wanting in her own effects to make > good his assertion: for so in physic things of melancholic hue and quality > are used against melancholy, sour against sour, salt to remove salt > humors.Milton 2007 p. 707 Milton continues, \\"Of the style and uniformity, and that commonly called the plot, whether intricate or explicit... they only will best judge who are not unacquainted with Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the three tragic poets unequaled yet by any, and the best rule to all who endeavor to write tragedy\\".Milton 2007 p. 708 As with his Christian epics, Milton fused classical and Scriptural ideas in order to create better English literature.Guibbory 2003 p. 72 Notes References * Bate, Walter Jackson.

It is found in article 138 which states: \\"Whoever kills another shall convicted of manslaughter, punishable with a sentence of imprisonment from ten to fifteen years\\". The main legal concept in article 138 is bad faith. It may be present in any form, whether direct or indirect. The active subject (whoever kills) as well as the passive subject (the one who is killed) are universal, meaning that either can be any person, regardless of the circumstances. Homicide committed by grave recklessness is covered in article 142, which includes both reckless homicide by weapons or motor vehicles and homicide caused by professional recklessness. It states: It is necessary to indicate that under Spanish law, involuntary homicide is not regulated; in the majority of cases the law that will be applied will be somewhere between homicide and the criminal concept which is involved. Other specific concepts, such as parricide and uxoricide also do not exist, since in Spanish criminal law the punishment is founded in the violation of the legal right and not the fact of killing one particular person or another.

They were employed by all branches of the United States Armed Forces from 1928-1969 for the purpose of training in detection, handling and familiarization with chemical warfare. Most CAIS were destroyed in the 1980s but the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency still occasionally demilitarizes CAIS that are found buried. History =Nomenclature= Throughout the military's use of CAIS they were known by several different common names aside from Chemical Agent Identification Sets. The other names were: Toxic Gas Sets, Chemical Agent Identification Training Sets, Instructional War Gas Identification Sets, Detonation War Gas Identification Sets, and Instructional Gas Identification Replacement Sets. =General history= CAIS were used by all branches of the United States military for training in detection, handling and familiarization with chemical warfare agents between the 1930s and 1960s. The U.S. Army used CAIS to train its soldiers from 1928 until 1969. During this time period more than 100,000 CAIS units were produced by all branches of the military. CAIS were declared obsolete in 1971 and systematically recalled from military installations during two operations. The first recall operation, Operation Set Consolidation I (SETCON I), was in 1978; SETCON II followed on in 1980. Specifications An example of a glass ampule found in Chemical Agent Identification Sets Chemical Agent Identification Sets were small glass vials, ampules or bottles which contained small amounts of chemical warfare agents or industrial chemicals. Each set contained more than two dozen glass ampules, each ampule contained about 100 milliliters of chemical agent. There were three subsets of CAIS, distributed in 18 different set configurations. These subsets included bottles of sulfur mustard used to purposely contaminate equipment or terrain for decontamination training.Meacham, Kim. \\"Removal and Destruction of Chemical Agent Identification Sets At Fort Benning\\", Environmental Branch, Engineering and Support Center, United States Army Corps of Engineers, via Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Great Britain). p. 3. accessed December 9, 2008. Another type of CAIS were known as \\"sniff sets\\" and were used to train soldiers to recognize the color and odor of chemical agents. Used indoors, the sniff sets contained agent-impregnated charcoal and agent simulants; they contained very little actual chemical warfare agent.Meacham, Kim. \\"Removal and Destruction of Chemical Agent Identification Sets At Fort Benning\\", Environmental Branch, Engineering and Support Center, United States Army Corps of Engineers, via Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Great Britain), accessed December 9, 2008. Chemical agents Each of the CAIS held between one and five different chemical agents. The agents used in CAIS were phosgene, adamsite, lewisite, cyanogen chloride, chloroacetophenone, sarin, nitrogen mustard, sulfur mustard and chloropicrin. In addition, triphosgene, a phosgene simulant, and ethyl malonate, a tabun simulant were also used. Sarin was the only nerve agent used in CAIS.Committee on Review and Evaluation of the Army Non-Stockpile Chemical Materiel Disposal Program, U.S. National Research Council.

Life He was the only son of John Wharton (d. 10 June 1629) by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Roger Hodson (d. 10 March 1646) of Fountains Abbey, and was born at Winston-on-Tees, county Durham, on 31 August 1614. He was admitted at Pembroke College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1638, and matriculated two days later.A slightly different matriculation date is given in He afterwards migrated to Trinity College, Oxford, where he acted for some time as tutor to John Scrope, natural son of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland. In 1642 he went to Bolton, where he remained three years studying; and then, having decided upon his future profession, removed to London and studied medicine under John Bathurst In 1646 he returned to Oxford, and was created M.D. on 7 May 1647. He was entered as a candidate of the College of Physicians on 25 January 1648, chosen fellow on 23 December 1650, incorporated at Cambridge on his doctor's degree in 1652, and held the post of censor of the Royal College of Physicians in 1658, 1661, 1666, 1667, 1668, and 1673. He obtained the appointment of physician to St Thomas's Hospital on 20 November 1659, and retained it till his death in 1673. Wharton was one of the very few physicians who remained at his post in London during the whole of the outbreak of the plague of 1665. His services were recognised by a promise of the first vacant appointment of physician in ordinary to the king. When, however, a vacancy occurred and he applied for the fulfilment of the promise, he was put off with a grant of honourable augmentation to his paternal arms, for which he had to pay Sir William Dugdale. Wharton died at his house in Aldersgate Street on 15 November 1673, and was buried on the 20th in the church of St Michael Bassishaw in Basinghall Street. He married Jane, daughter of William Ashbridge of London, by whom he had three sons: Thomas, father of George Wharton (both physicians; George married Anna Maria, daughter of William Petty), Charles, and William; the last two died young. His wife predeceased him on 20 July 1669, and was buried at St Michael Bassishaw on the 23rd. Work Wharton described the glands more accurately than had previously been done, and made researches into their nature and use, relying on dissection and experiment. He was the discoverer of the duct of the sub-mandibulary gland for the conveyance of the saliva into the mouth, which bears his name. He made a special study of the minute anatomy of the pancreas. William Oughtred, in the epistle to his Clavis Mathematicae (London, 1648), speaks of Wharton's proficiency; and Izaak Walton, in his Compleat Angler, expresses indebtedness to Wharton, and calls him a friend. He wrote four English verses under a fanciful engraving prefixed to a translation by Elias Ashmole, entitled Arcanum, or the Grand Secret of Hermetic Philosophy, and published in his Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum (London, 1652). Wharton and Bathurst had visited Arthur Dee for Ashmole (who translated his Fasciculus Chemicus, but never met him).Arthur Dee, Lyndy Abraham (editor), Elias Ashmole (translator), Fasciculus Chemicus (1997), p. lxvi. Ashmole and Wharton worked together on the catalogue of the Musaeum Tradescantianum, printed in 1650, stemming from a visit they paid John Tradescant the younger in 1650. Their friendship was troubled, but reconciliation took place before Wharton's death. Wharton published Adenographia; sive glandularum totius corporis descriptio, London, 1656 (plates); Amsterdam, 1659; Oberwesel, 1664, 1671,1675; D√ºsseldorf, 1730. Large portions of the work were printed in Le Clerc and Mangot's Bibliotheca Anatomica, Geneva, 1699.

Daniels, writing under the pseudonym of \\"Neil Mor√©t,\\" and lyrics by Gus Kahn. It is now regarded as a jazz standard. Origin The sheet music of Chlo-e (Song of the Swamp) bears the front cover image of singer Ethel Waters and connects it to the show Africana. This marked the Broadway debut of Waters, and began her rise to stardom. Produced by Earl Dancer and principally written by Donald Heywood, the show opened on July 11, 1927. \\"Chloe\\"‚Äîto which the title is frequently, and usefully, modified, and is used hereafter‚Äîmay have been placed in this revue as a later addition to the production. Waters' never recorded Chloe, and it is not listed among the known songs that she sang in Africana. The sheet music was first published in 1927 by Charles N. Daniels' own Villa Mor√©t imprint, based in San Francisco. In 1934, Heywood re-fashioned Africana into an operetta, but it did not include Chloe or any other external number. It closed after just three performances. Content Chloe tells a story. The verse is sung by an omniscient narrator, describing the struggle of a lonely character, conducting a long and determined search for \\"Chloe\\" in the \\"dismal swampland.\\" The searcher then picks up the chorus, with its hook of \\"I Got to go where you are,\\" declaring that \\"If you live, I'll find you.\\" The score is marked \\"In a tragic way\\" and while‚Äîowing to its narrative opening‚Äîit is not necessarily gender-specific, its range and melodic line suggests that it was designed for low voice. Women have sung it also, including Dinah Shore, Valaida Snow and Eva Taylor, who recorded the first female vocal version for Okeh in 1928, followed closely by Bessie Brown for Brunswick. While its topic hearkens back to the milieu of minstrel-type material, the music is uncharacteristically rich, dark hued, expressive and atypical of the Jazz Age, looking forward to the more muted and reflective sound of depression-era songwriting. Recordings The first recording of Chloe was made for Columbia in Los Angeles in September 1927 by singer Douglas Richardson, a vocalist with ties to Charles N. Daniels; it was followed by another Columbia by The Singing Sophomores made in November. The first instrumental recording of Chloe was made by the All-Star Orchestra for Victor, with a vocal chorus by Franklyn Baur, in December 1927. This is identified in the Victor ledgers as \\"the Fud and Farley Orchestra, directed by Nat Shilkret,\\" indicating the probable participation of Fud Livingston and Max Farley. Shilkret recorded another arrangement of it for Victor with his Rhyth-Melodists in March 1928. However, the record that appears to have popularized Chloe is an elaborate version by the Paul Whiteman Concert Orchestra recorded in 1928 with vocals by Austin Young. This arrived along with a host of other 1928 recordings of the song. These include Bob Haring, as the \\"Colonial Club Orchestra\\" and Louis Katzman for Brunswick, and a vocal version for Victor featuring the vocal group The Rounders, recorded in Oakland, California. The Tracy-Brown Orchestra of Chicago recorded it for Columbia in March 1928 with a vocal by Sam Coslow; Coslow also recorded a test of the piece for Victor that year, but it didn't pass. Seger Ellis recorded it in a vocal rendition for Okeh that was the first made by a crooner; Sam Lanin recorded it for Okeh in January under the name of The Gotham Troubadours. Among budget labels, Plaza Records' Hollywood Dance Orchestra, led by Adrian Schubert and with a vocal by Leroy Montesanto, recorded it in January, and Cameo/Path√© waxed it as by the Goodrich Broadcasters‚Äîpossibly Sam Lanin again‚Äîin February. The most famous recording of Chloe is a parody version by Spike Jones and his City Slickers, featuring a vocal by Red Ingle and recorded for RCA Victor in 1945. Another humorous version was cut by diseuse Leona Anderson in 1957 for her LP Music to Suffer By. Among serious recordings, instrumental versions far outdistance the vocal ones. The most respected instrumental version is the 1940 recording by Duke Ellington's Famous Orchestra, with a \\"wah-wah\\" intro by trombonist Tricky Sam Nanton, featuring Cootie Williams on trumpet alternating with bassist Jimmy Blanton and a solo by Ben Webster; Billy Strayhorn's arrangement makes a radical overhaul of Daniels' harmony, and places the verse after the chorus.This version by Duke Ellington from October 28, 1940 in Chicago is part of Never No Lament: The Blanton-Webster Band as well as other compilations of the orchestra's recordings of that time. This chart also appears on the famous live recording made of the Ellington Orchestra in Fargo, North Dakota in December 1940. Among other notable pre-war instrumental versions of Chloe is Benny Goodman's from 1937, Art Tatum's piano solo from 1938 and those by Tommy Dorsey and John Kirby (musician), both from 1940. After the war, it was recorded by jazz artists such as Herbie Harper, Don Byas, Eddie Bert, Frank Rosolino, Jimmy Rowles, Jerry Jerome, Herbie Harper, Nat Adderley, Cal Tjader, Charlie Mariano, Shelly Manne, Arne Domnerus, Paul Horn, Al Cohn, Bob Wilber (at least twice), Bill Doggett, Flip Phillips and Eddie Heywood. George Melachrino arranged it for string orchestra; Bunk Johnson‚Äîin his last session in 1948‚Äîrecorded it in a traditional jazz setting, and Ry Cooder has performed it as a guitar solo. Non-jazz oriented recordings of Chloe were made by the Everly Brothers in 1961 and by guitarist Mickey Baker in 1962. The most well- known vocal version is that by Louis Armstrong, who did not record the piece until 1952; it was also sung on record by Henry \\"Red\\" Allen, for ARC in 1936. Ray Conniff included it with a chorus on his 1965 LP Love Affair. Film and television Although it was seldom recorded in the early part of the 1930s, Chloe was heard constantly on radio during this period, as it fit in with the general mood of the times. Its popularity led to a loose horror film adaptation based on the song directed by Marshall Neilan entitled Chloe, Love Is Calling You (1934) filmed in the Everglades and starring Olive Borden. Produced by short-lived poverty row studio Pinnacle Productions, it was targeted to African-American audiences, but was unsuccessful. A 1929 short made in Britain by the early sound company Electrocord also likely was a performance of the song, but it is unclear as to by whom. Probably as a nod to the song, the monster in Norm McCabe's Daffy Duck cartoon The Impatient Patient (1942) is named \\"Chloe\\" and lives in a swamp. Singer Vera Van performs a lovely and romantic version, without the introductory verse, in the Vitaphone short, \\"Mirrors\\" featuring Freddie Rich and his Orchestra. The film was released on September 8, 1934. In an early episode of the 1951-53 CBS-TV version of Amos 'n' Andy known as The Amos 'n' Andy Show, actress singer Lillian Randolph portraying Andy's estranged ex-fiancee, Madame Queen, wins a television contest for her rendition of the song Chloe. Other songs named \\"Chloe\\" Chloe is not to be confused with Al Jolson and Buddy DeSylva's song Chloe, written for the show Sinbad in 1918 and recorded by Jolson in 1920, nor an Elton John song by that title included on his 1981 album The Fox.

He was one of the most influential public intellectuals in post‚ÄìWorld War II Slovenia.  Early years and revolutionary activity  Du≈°an Pirjevec was born in Solkan, which was then a suburb of the Italian town of Gorizia. His birthplace is now located in the Slovenian town of Nova Gorica. His father was the literary historian Avgust Pirjevec from Gorizia; his mother, Iva n√©e Mozetiƒç, came from a wealthy merchant family from Solkan.Du≈°an Pirjevec: slovenska kultura in literarna veda (Ljubljana: FF, 2011), 312 His sister, Ivica Pirjevec, later became an anti-Nazi agitator and was captured and killed by the Nazis in 1944 (a street in the Ljubljana neighbourhood of Tacen in the ≈†marna Gora District bears her name). Soon after Du≈°an's birth, the family moved to Ljubljana, in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where his father worked as the chief librarian of the National Research Library. Du≈°an attended the Ljubljana Technical High School, and in 1939 he enrolled in the University of Zagreb, where he studied agronomy. In 1940, he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Already in his teenage years, Pirjevec developed an interest in literature, especially in the French po√®tes maudits. In the years before World War II, he published several articles under different pseudonyms in the distinguished liberal-progressive literary journal Ljubljanski zvon. Together with the young poet Karel Destovnik Kajuh, he was the co-editor of the radical magazine Svobodna mladina (\\"The Free Youth\\"). In the early 1940s, he took part of the \\"Conflict on the Literary Left\\", a polemics involving the critical Croatian left-wing writer Miroslav Krle≈æa against the Communist Party's ideological hardliners around Boris Ziherl and Edvard Kardelj. In the polemics, was largely evolving around the relation between personal artistic freedom and collective revolutionary engagement, Pirjevec defended Krle≈æa's insistence on artistic freedom, trying to show that it is not in conflict with a Marxist Leninist position. Partisan Soon after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Pirjevec joined the Partisan resistance in the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, adopting the battle name Ahac, by which he remained known for the rest of his life. In late 1941, he was involved in the fight against the Italian Fascist occupation regime in the so-called Province of Ljubljana. He chose the fighting name Ahac (Agathius). The choice was highly symbolic: since the late 16th, Saint Agathius was venerated in the Slovene Lands as the patron saint against Turkish invasions, and in the 17th century he was also venerated as the saint protector of Carniola. His talent in organization was spotted by the communist leader Ale≈° Bebler who secured Pirjevec's promotion to the rank of political commissar in the military units active in Lower Carniola. During this time, he became notorious for his bellicosity and brutal treatment of opponents. In a highly controversial memoir published posthumously in 1990, fellow fighter and famous essayist Jo≈æe Javor≈°ek even accused Pirjevec of burning war prisoners alive.Jo≈æe Javor≈°ek, Spomini na Slovence III. Ljubljana: Adit, 1990. 92 He was also involved in an internal enquiry over the massacre of a group of Romani people in the region of White Carniola in 1942, but was acquitted. In 1943, he was sent to organize the resistance fight to the Slovenian Littoral and to Friulian Slovenia in Italy, and in 1944 to southern Carinthia. After the end of the War, Pirjevec was placed in the propaganda units of the newly established communist regime in Slovenia. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked as the editor of the daily newspaper Ljudska pravica (People's Justice), the main communist newspaper in Slovenia. There, he met the literary critic Bojan ≈†tih, who introduced him to contemporary trends in literature. In 1947, Pirjevec became the chairman of the Agitprop section at the University of Ljubljana. During this period, he became a close personal friend with Vitomil Zupan, with whom he engaged in several provocations of what they saw as the \\"reactionary and petit bourgeoise\\" cultural scene in Ljubljana. In summer 1948, he was arrested and trialed in a show trial for numerous severe crimes, such as subversive activity, immoral acts and rape. Unlike his close personal friend who was arrested and accused of the same crimes in the same trial, Pirjevec was sentenced to a relatively mild sentence of two years in prison. He was released already after half a year, and put on probation. He was excluded from the Communist Party and stripped of all his war honours.  The scholar  Between 1948 and 1952, Pirjevec studied French language and comparative literature at the University of Ljubljana under the supervision of the famous literary historian Anton Ocvirk. Between 1952 and 1961, he was employed as a clerk at the Institute for Literature of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, later rising to the position of personal assistant to the Institute's president Josip Vidmar. In 1958, Pirjevec became an assistant at the Department for Comparative Literature of the University of Ljubljana. In 1959, he was actively involved the so-called \\"Slodnjak affair\\", when the conservative-minded literary historian Anton Slodnjak was dismissed from his post of professor of Slovene literature for having published an anthology of Slovene literature in Germany, which included several authors which were not well viewed by the communist regime.http://www.demokracija.si/index.php?sekcija=clanki&clanek;=1088http://lit.ijs.si/okmeclu.html The same year, Pirjevec was admitted again to the Communist Party. Between 1961 and 1962, Pirjevec started a long polemic with the Serbian writer Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá regarding the cultural policies in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In contrast to ƒÜosiƒá, who argued for a more unified and centralized cultural policy in Yugoslavia, Pirjevec defended the cultural autonomy of the single republics in the Yugoslav federation. The polemic gave Pirjevec a high degree of public visibility. In 1961, Pirjevec achieved his PhD in comparative literature and in 1963 he became a professor at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. In the late 1960s, he rose to prominence among students as a charismatic professor. The Department of Comparative Literature, where he taught, became one of the most vibrant centers of Slovene intellectual scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Among Pirjevec's pupils were Dimitrij Rupel, Niko Grafenauer, Rudi ≈†eligo, Andrej Inkret and many other intellectuals who later formed the core of the intellectual movement focused around the alternative journal Nova revija. In this period, Pirjevec also developed a close friendship with literary historian Taras Kermauner and philosopher Ivo Urbanƒçiƒç, who represented critical positions towards the communist system. In 1964, Pirjevec criticized the regime's decision to prohibit the publication of the alternative journal Perspektive, and was again expulsed from the Party for this reason. In the 1960s, Pirjevec published several monographs on modern Slovene literature, focusing especially on the fin-de-siecle period. Most famous were his studies on the writer and essayist Ivan Cankar. He also published numerous studies of classical works of the western canon, in which the most famous is his treatise on the problem of evil in the works of Dostoyevski. He based his scholarly research on the esthetic theories of Hegel, Georg Luk√°cs and Mikhail Bakhtin, but also on Sartre's existential philosophy and Roman Ingarden phenomenology of the literary science. He was also receptive to currents coming from the new historicism. During this period, Pirjevec maintained close contacts with the Praxis School, which was trying to formulate an alternative and humanist vision of Marxism. He was also member of the Committee of the famous Korƒçula Summer School organized by the Praxis group. Between 1969 and 1971, he served as editor of the Slovenian journal Sodobnost. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pirjevec was sympathetic to the student movement that developed at the University of Ljubljana. In 1971, he joined the protests against the arrest of two students of the University, Frane Adam and Milan Jesih, which escalated in the occupation of the Faculty of Arts by the students. From the 1970s, Pirjevec gradually left his previous Marxist positions. Under the influence of the philosopher Ivan Urbanƒçiƒç, he grew increasingly closer to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, whom he personally met in 1974. He died in Ljubljana on August 4, 1977 and was buried in the cemetery in ≈†martno pod ≈†marno Goro.  Personal life  Pirjevec was married twice. His first wife was his partisan co-fighter, the university professor of French language Marjeta Vasiƒç, the second was the actress and later writer Nedeljka Kacin. His daughter Alenka Pirjevec is a famous theatre actress and puppeteer. His second daughter with Slovenian journalist Olga Ratej is a Slovenian dramaturg Ira Ratej.  Influence and legacy  Together with Edvard Kocbek, Pirjevec is considered one of the most influential intellectuals in Slovenia in the period between 1945 and 1980. He influenced not only literary critic and history, but also philosophers such as Tine Hribar, Ivan Urbanƒçiƒç, Dean Komel and Croatian philosopher Mario Kopiƒá.http://www.pogledi.si/knjiga/pirjevec-aktualen-na- hrvaskem He was crucial in the intellectual development of several public figures, among whom the most famous was writer and sociologist Dimitrij Rupel, who later became the first Slovenian foreign minister. Pirjevec was portrayed in several novels and memoirs, including Gert Hofmann's Die Fistelstimme (1982), Milan Dekleva's Oko v zraku (\\"The Eye in the Air\\"), Iztok Osojnik's Bra≈üow, Rudi ≈†eligo's Izgubljeni sve≈æenj (\\"The Lost Bundle\\"), and Taras Kermauner's Navzkri≈æna sreƒçavanja (\\"Crossed Encounters\\"), as well as in Boris A. Novak's epos Vrata nepovrata (\\"The Door of No Return\\"). Pirjevec's view on the national question, articulated in polemics with the ideologue of Yugoslav Socialism Edvard Kardelj, was particularly influential among the dissident Slovene intellectuals of the late 1970s and 1980s. Pirjevec was the single most quoted author in the \\"Contributions to the Slovenian National Program\\", a public manifesto written by 16 non-communist intellectuals in 1987, which is frequently seen as the beginning of the Slovene movement for independence that culminated in the declaration of independence of Slovenia in 1991. In 1997, a bust of Pirjevec was erected in the hall of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. In 1998, a memorial plaque was placed in his native house in Nova Gorica.

It has been founded in 1959 as a politically and denominationally neutral organisation and has 60 employees in Switzerland and approximately 1,400 staff abroad. The main fields of activity are fostering skills development, small and medium enterprises, financial services and resource efficiency.  History  The aim of all of Swisscontact's activities is to reduce poverty by private sector development. Swisscontact was founded in 1959 under the name of Swiss Foundation for Technical Cooperation by leading figures from the Swiss business world, universities and politics. The first initiative came from Anne-Marie Im Hof-Piguet (1916-2010), who was of the opinion \\"that because of its wealth and as country without a colonial past, Switzerland should play an important role in development aid\\".Franziska Diener: Die Schweizerische Stiftung f√ºr technische Entwicklungshilfe (Swisscontact) 1956 ‚Äì 1971. p. 19. In the 1960s, Swisscontact set up vocational training colleges in Africa, Asia and Latin America and provided further training for the instructors at these colleges. This was followed in the 1980s by the launch of schemes aimed at promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), after graduates from the vocational training colleges had said that there was an urgent need for expert advice when setting up businesses. It was also evident that SMEs were experiencing considerable difficulty in obtaining commercial and investment credits. As a result, the organization introduced programmes favouring the creation of micro-finance institutions. After training car mechanics, Swisscontact also went on to develop integral solutions for preventing air pollution. The organization was renamed in 1972, but retained its old title as a supplement.  Organisation  Swisscontact has 60 employees in Switzerland and approximately 1,100 staff abroad. It carries out over 100 projects in 36 different countries to promote economic stability. The board of trustees consists of about 30 people from the business world, university and politics. Swisscontact is specialized in project implementation, accepts assignments from public and private partners and carries out projects that have been put out to public tender. The organization also runs a programme of its own activities that are financed from donations and contributions from the state. The foundation with headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, is certified with the ZEWO seal of quality from the Swiss agency responsible for monitoring charitable organizations that raise donations in Switzerland. Two important partners of Swisscontact are the governmental organisations Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Since 2019, Springfield Centre, Durham (GB), has been a subsidiary of Swisscontact. The Springfield Centre is a consulting, training and research company focused on market systems development.  Topical priorities  Swisscontact is convinced that employment and income open up pathways out of poverty and can reduce economic disparities. An innovative private sector strengthens structurally weak regions and enables disadvantaged groups to become active market participators. All activities of Swisscontact can be divided into four areas of operation: = Skills development = Since 1959 Swisscontact has been committed to providing vocational training and further education, the assumption being that professional competence is the key to the economic and social development of a country. Swisscontact started off by setting up technical vocational training colleges (for mechanics, electricians, electronic technicians, etc.) based on the Swiss model in countries where infrastructure was lacking. Over the past 25 years the main focus in the promotion of vocational training has shifted to instructing vocational training college instructors and setting up national vocational training systems on the one hand and to holding shorter courses on the other, in particular for unemployed youngsters and disadvantaged sectors of the population (in development cooperation usually called ¬´skills training¬ª). In simple basic courses, they can acquire knowledge that will give them the chance to find a job or become self-employed. Emphasis is always placed on getting as many women as possible involved in the schemes. At present, around 45% of those who have benefited are women. Swisscontact supports practical vocational training by: *Vocational education and training: Swisscontact works locally through existing institutions and training centres, usually by training teachers and instructors or with the establishment of teacher training institutes. *Labor market insertion: This includes instruments like counseling, placement services, work programmes, employment incentives, internships, occupational and life skills training, start-up incentives. = Enterprise Promotion = Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are the largest employers in developing countries as well. Swisscontact aims at strengthening the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses. The organisation's market system development approach, referred to as Inclusive Markets addresses the constraints and opportunities of markets for disadvantaged people. To make markets more inclusive, Swisscontact refers to three different approaches: *Value chain development: This approach focuses on a certain sector with growth potential. It supports small businesses, especially farmer organisations, to establish themselves as suppliers in national and global value chains by training and technical assistance or quality management. *Regional and local economic development: In cases where geographic isolation is the primary constraint, the specific local development potential is taken as a starting point. *Entrepreneurship: Swisscontact supports innovative, risk-oriented individuals to seize business opportunities by facilitating business enabling environments, access to financial services and to non- financial resources such as information and know-how. In practice, these approaches are often combined. = Inclusive Finance = In development cooperation, all financial services provided for people on low incomes in developing countries are bracketed together under the collective term microfinance. Their aim is to give small and medium enterprises access to banking services that allow them to maintain or expand their companies. Swisscontact does not grant microcredits, but instead assists local microcredit banks, insurance companies and savings and credit associations with advice and further training.Swisscontact Approach to financial sector development Swisscontact's activities in financial services include: *develop financial products services and products with local partners for small enterprises *capacity building in financial skills *develop new technologies and improve infrastructure *improve the regulatory framework Swisscontact especially promotes microleasing (leasing productive assets, e.g. agricultural tools, livestock). = Climate-smart Economy = Swisscontact is working for an economically, socially and ecologically sustainable development and is considering the responsible use of natural resources a prerequisite to achieve this. The organisations believes that services related to climate protection and associated technologies represent a growth market and will in future be able to provide people with jobs and income in developing countries as well. An example of this is recycling of reusable materials. Swisscontact lends its support by: *Situational analyses *Public relations work to increase environmental awareness *Advising authorities on drafting laws and decrees *Training instructors and professionals and strengthening the dialogue between different actors and civil society *Transfer of technologies and processes = Senior Expert Corps = Since 1979 Swisscontact has a pool of retired professionals called the Senior Expert Corps. Its members are supporting SMEs in developing and transition countries in solving technical and operational problems on a voluntary basis. If necessary they provide further training to the personnel and management of the company. One assignment lasts a maximum of three months. The pool contains experts in: marketing and management consulting, electrical, civil and mechanical engineering, hotel and tourism services, food engineering, education, medical and health care services, agronomy and forestry engineering, construction and other specialized fields.

Overview  Pietrzak was a Polish American who joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 2003. After a tour in Iraq as a helicopter mechanic, Pietrzak returned to the United States, where he met and married Jenkins. Together, they owned and lived in a house in Winchester, a census-designated place in Riverside County, California, located near the Marine Corps Air Station Camp Pendleton, where Pietrzak worked. On October 15, 2008, four Marines entered the Pietrzak home, sexually assaulted Jenkins-Pietrzak and tortured the couple before killing them. Two of the four accused Marines worked under Pietrzak's command. Despite efforts to convey the event as being racially motivated because the perpetrators were African American, Riverside County authorities maintain the motivation was robbery, and the pending murder with special circumstances and sexual assault charges do not include an assertion that the crime was racially motivated. All four of the accused plead not guilty to murdering Pietrzak and his wife. After meeting with the families of the deceased, District Attorney Rod Pacheco decided to seek the death penalty on January 22, 2009. The preliminary trial hearings to determine whether the four assailants would stand trial occurred on March 26, 2009, and April 3, 2009 in San Diego. On 24 June 2013 a jury rendered a verdict of death for two of the four assailants and life in prison without parole for a third. The fourth assailant was later also sentenced to death.> Background Jan Pawe≈Ç Pietrzak, named after Pope John Paul II, was born in either K≈Çodzko or Bielawa, Poland. In 1994, when Pietrzak was age ten, his family emigrated to the U.S., and settled in the Bensonhurst neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Pietrzak joined the Marines in 2003, became a helicopter mechanic and was sent to Iraq. After his return, he married Jenkins, whom he had met in 2005 at a party for Marines being deployed to Iraq. Jenkins, who worked for the local Black Infant Care Center, was initially reluctant to date a Marine. But Pietrzak won her over, and they were married on August 8, 2008. They bought a house in May in Winchester, an area near Temecula, California and near Camp Pendleton, and Pietrzak remained in the Marines, working as a helicopter airframe mechanic at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.  Death  On October 15, 2008, a group of four Marines entered the Pietrzak home. It was not initially known how they managed to get in as Jenkins-Pietrzak was very careful about security and had equipped the house with an alarm. Later, it was alleged that Tyrone Miller forced entry into the residence by pointing a shotgun at Pietrzak.\\"Marines Accused of Killing Temecula Couple To Be Arraigned Thursday\\". After a short skirmish, the couple were bound with duct tape and gagged. Jenkins-Pietrzak was then sexually assaulted as her husband was forced to watch. Finally, both were shot in the head, execution-style. Several small fires were set in the home in an apparent attempt to destroy evidence of the crime. Lance Cpl. Emrys John, age 18, of Maryland, Lance Cpl. Kesaun Sykes, age 21, of California, Pvt. Kevin Darnell Cox, 20, of Tennessee, and Lance Cpl. Tyrone Miller, age 20, of North Carolina were charged with the murders. Two of the four Marines charged in the execution-style murders worked for Pietrzak.Fuentes, Gidget (June 28, 2009). \\"Killed in Their Own Home\\". Military Times. Three of the suspects claim that the shooter was 18-year-old John. Miller and Cox have reportedly confessed to the murders, although all four suspects have accused the others of raping Jenkins-Pietrzak. Shortly before the murder, John posted \\"Chillin waitin 4 da killin\\" on his MySpace page. Motives Three days after the murder, the Los Angeles Times ran an October 18, 2008, news brief noting that the bodies were identified on October 17. On November 3, the Sheriff's Department announced that it had four Marines under arrest for the murders. As part of the November 3 announcement, the Sheriff's Department noted that investigators had found numerous items of evidence since October 15 linking the four to the killings, even though the killers set a fire in the house to destroy evidence. On November 6, CNN television news journalist Jane Velez-Mitchell reported that the four Marines under arrest were African American and raised the possibility of race as a motivation. In early November, the four Marines were charged with two counts of murder with special circumstances ‚Äî murder during commission of a felony, murder during commission of a robbery and committing more than one offense. They additionally face one charge each of sexual penetration with a foreign object, and the District Attorney's office will decide if to pursue death sentences. Just after the release of the charges, the New York Post ran a story entitled \\"A Few 'Bad' Men - Race Eyed in Marine Dual Slay\\" which noted that the four accused Marines \\"could face the death penalty amid speculation the mixed-race couple was targeted in a bias attack.\\" At about the same time, District Attorney Rod Pacheco emphasized the robbery motive, commenting, \\"To burglarize their home and then to treat them in the way they did before they died and to murder them ‚Äî it's hard for our minds to comprehend this kind of savagery.\\" By mid-November, the Riverside County Sheriff's Central Homicide unit responded to the race motivation issue, stating \\"There's nothing to suggest what happened was a racial crime.\\" Detectives said jewelry, a camera, and wedding gifts had been stolen, and that some of the items were found in the suspects' barracks. Despite the conclusion proposed by the investigators, the couple's parents and many in the general populace, as shown by blogs and posts over the Internet, continue to believe that there was a possible racial motive, particularly since Jenkins-Pietrzak was sexually assaulted, and there was evidence of premeditation in the murders (as 'Chillin waitin 4 da killin' was posted on a perpetrator's MySpace page before the murders) Anti- miscegenation racial epithets in the form of \\"Nigger Lover\\" were found on the wall near the master bedroom and on a bathroom mirror. The Defendants have all indicated that spray-painting the racial epithets was a calculated attempt to misdirect investigators. On November 20, all four pleaded not guilty to murdering the Pietrzaks. District Attorney Rod Pacheco on February 2, 2009, decided to pursue the death penalty against the suspects. Correspondence and other involvement with White House Pietrzak's mother, Henryka Pietrzak-Varga has repeatedly stated she believes the murders were racially motivated, as her son and daughter-in-law were not affluent individuals. On November 11, 2008 (Veteran's Day), Pietrzak's mother composed a formal letter to president-elect Barack Obama in which she discussed what her son and daughter-in-law had endured, and the possible primary motive for the murders. In this letter, Henryka stated: \\"If it was a robbery, why didn't they come when nobody was home instead of in the dead of night, armed to the teeth? ... What was it about my son and daughter-in-law that inspired such hatred and loathing?\\" \\\\- Full text of the letter sent by Henryka Pietrzak-Varga to Barack Obama Seven months later on July 27, 2009, the Obama administration responded with generic form letter of the type issued to all soldiers killed in combat.\\"7 Months after Letter, Mom of Murdered Marine Sgt. Pietrzak Gets Form Response from Obama Aide\\". When knowledge of this indirect, insincere reply reached the news media, the Obama administration issued an apology.\\"White House Apologizes to Mom of Brooklyn Marine for Form-Letter Flap\\". The mothers of both Pietrzak and Jenkins requested a formal audience with President Obama; in a letter to the president, the mother of Sgt. Jan Pawe≈Ç Pietrzak conveyed her wishes to discuss just \\"how the sacrifice of Jan Pawe≈Ç and Quiana could unite us.\\"\\"Mothers of Slain Marine Sgt. Jan Pawe≈Ç Pietrzak and His Wife Appeal for Meeting with President Obama\\". On August 17, 2009, the Commissioner on Civil Rights in Poland also wrote to the U.S. Ambassador to Poland, supporting this request.Letter from Polish Commissioner on Civil Rights\\"Polish Official Intercedes on Behalf of Mothers of Slain Brooklyn Marine Sgt. Pietrzak and His Wife. The U.S. ambassador responded with a short letter on August 24, which although acknowledging Pietrzak's military service to the United States and stressing the general need for the perpetrators to be brought to account, was generally reticent to discuss a potential racial motivation for the murders.Reply from US Ambassador Criminal trials On April 3, at a preliminary hearing for the four defendants, prosecutors alleged that the motivation for the crime was financial, not racial. Evidence, however, presented at the hearing detailed that two racist remarks were spray painted in the couple's home. Evidence was also presented showing that Jenkins- Pietrzak was sexually assaulted and that Jan was severely beaten. Riverside County investigator Benjamin Ramirez testified that property belonging to the couple was recovered from Miller's residence on Camp Pendleton, including bank cards, a bracelet with the couple's names written in Polish, and Pietrzak's dress blue uniform. Investigators further testified that footprints left at the crime scene were linked to shoes belonging to the suspects.Rogers, Rick (April 4, 2009). \\"Slayings Of Marine, Wife Focus Of Hearing\\". The San Diego Union-Tribune. p. B1. On May 8, 2009, a recording was played in court of Cox's girlfriend, Melissa Buck, stating that after Cox and the other three accused returned home after the alleged murder, they drank beer and that one of them said, \\"Good job, E. You earned your stripes tonight.\\" Buck stated that the four had carried out other burglaries prior to the killings and that she had gone with them on one occasion.Dillon, Nancy; Siemaszko, Corky (May 9, 2009). \\"Soldiers Toasted Killing Of B'klyn Marine & Wife\\".

Weissinger had accompanied Miller and the other suspects on previous burglaries and home invasions.

The mixtape was made available to stream and download on November 4, 2008, containing snippets and demos from Fall Out Boy as well as various Decaydance artists. Origins The campaign started when the website for Decaydance Records was supposedly \\"hacked\\" by an organization called \\"Citizens For Our Betterment\\". A posted link led to the organization's website which was decorated in the colors of the American flag.Citizens for Our Betterment Links on the page were met with dead ends, requiring specific IP addresses to access their destinations. A post counter was displayed on the page with the number 59,994. Wentz left clues on his personal blog that the 60,000th would reveal something big. The Decaydance site returned to normal the following day. On August 19, his then- wife, Ashlee Simpson, was seen carrying a pamphlet for the organization, raising suspicion and sparking many rumors online. New posts appeared on the Citizens for Our Betterment web page everyday, many referring to November 4, the same day as the 2008 US presidential election. Also, Wentz posted more clues on his blog. More and more links were opened to the public as well. On August 24, one such link led to a page saying \\"FOB - The Return - November Four\\" in large Stencil font, causing many to believe that Fall Out Boy would release their new album on November 4. Others theorized that this was another one of Wentz's attempts to raise political awareness, as he did by previously holding a rally for then-US Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama. Also, many Fueled by Ramen bands posted MySpace bulletins that same day with the title \\"Welcome to the New Administration\\". Every bulletin contained one word‚Äî\\"ten\\". Finally, on August 25, 2008, the Citizens for Our Betterment website was redirected to the band's Friends or Enemies page, which displayed an image of a voting booth featuring ballots with the names of several Decaydance artists. By clicking on each individual ballot, there is an audio clip from the respective artist reciting passages from past posts on the Citizens for Our Betterment website.

It won a Mythopoeic Award in 2000 for adult literature. Plot summary Jenny Gluckstein, a moody Jewish-American teenager, lives with her mother Sally in New York City. Jenny's closest confidante is her cat, Mister Cat. When Sally marries Evan, a Englishman with two sons, the family relocates to Dorset, where Evan has been hired to renovate 300-year-old Stourhead Farm. Due to the extent of the restoration, the family must live in the farm's dilapidated manor house plagued with unexplained annoyances: erratic electricity and plumbing, strange cold spots and odors, terrifying howling overhead on stormy nights, and a darkened third-story window that does not correspond to any room in the house. For Jenny, already upset with her mother's remarriage, the move, and the state of the house, the final straw comes when Mister Cat must be quarantined for six months. Jenny resolves never to accept her step-family or her new home. After returning from quarantine, Mister Cat's presence attracts a ghostly Persian cat only he and Jenny can see. Following the cats one night, Jenny locates the mysterious third-story room, where she discovers the ghost of Tamsin Willoughby, daughter of the farm's original owner. Ghosts endure as long as they remember being alive, but Tamsin has blocked out the circumstances surrounding her death, including what became of her sweetheart Edric Davies. Jenny comes to believe something sinister happened the night Tamsin died. Jenny and Tamsin become close friends, and Tamsin introduces Jenny to the numerous supernatural creatures that occupy the grounds, including the shape-shifting Pooka, while teaching her to avoid more dangerous beings such as the all-powerful Old Lady of the Elder Tree, who ruled the land before mankind came. Through her nightly conversations with Tamsin, Jenny learns about Judge Jeffreys, whose Bloody Assizes terrorized the surrounding area after the Monmouth Rebellion, and who once romantically pursued Tamsin. The Pooka warns that Tamsin's return has also summoned the ghost of Judge Jeffreys, who is still intent on possessing her. Jeffreys' presence makes it difficult for Tamsin to retain her memories, imperiling her existence. As Jeffreys grows strong enough to impact the living, Jenny continues to research the farm's history and learns that Tamsin and Edric intended to elope in secret, but that Edric never arrived at the arranged meeting place. Tamsin waited hours in the rain before being discovered by Jeffreys. At Tamsin's bedside when she died of pneumonia, Jeffreys overheard her last words. With this information, Tamsin is able to remember the night she died: delirious with fever and believing Edric abandoned her, she cursed Edric to wait for her as she had waited in vain for him. Jeffreys used the power of Tamsin's dying words to summon the Wild Hunt to chase Edric for all eternity, resulting in the screams heard on stormy nights. The cruelty of Tamsin's curse condemned her soul to be trapped at Stourhead. Only Tamsin is capable of undoing the curse and freeing both herself and Edric, but she is slowly succumbing to Jeffreys' more powerful and determined spirit. On a stormy night when the Hunt is passing overhead, Jeffreys returns to claim a much-weakened Tamsin. With Jenny's encouragement, Tamsin calls down the Hunt and demands they release Edric, but Jeffreys, who still possesses power over the Hunt, sets them on Jenny. Jenny is forced to run for her life before encountering the Old Lady of the Elder Tree, disguised for centuries as cantankerous villager Mrs. Fallowfield, whose familiar (in the form of an ugly, vicious lapdog) Jenny has rescued from Mister Cat on several previous occasions. Because of this favor, the Lady rescues Jenny and turns the Wild Hunt on Jeffreys. The Lady commands Jenny to forget what she has witnessed, but before departing for the afterlife with Edric, Tamsin kisses Jenny, allowing her to remember. Several years later, Jenny has matured from the angry, moody teen she once was and become closer with her step-family, a change she attributes to her friendship with Tamsin. Her research into Tamsin's life and times has given her a deeper appreciation of her new home's history. On the verge of leaving Stourhead to attend the University of Cambridge, Jenny fears she will never experience magic again. The Pooka appears to assure her that she herself has been changed by what she witnessed and that she will always share a connection with the magical world, no matter where she goes.http://www.peterbeagle.com/books/tamsin/ Awards * 2000 Mythopoeic Awardhttp://www.mythsoc.org/awards/2000/ References External links * Tamsin, at Peter S.

If seen as a single entity, the EU is by far Morocco's largest trading partner. In recent years, Morocco has reduced its dependence on phosphate exports, emerging as an exporter of manufactured and agricultural products, and as a growing tourism destination. However, its competitiveness in basic manufactured goods, such as textiles, is hampered by low labour productivity and high wages. Morocco is dependent on imported fuel and its food import requirement can rise substantially in drought years, as in 2007. Although Morocco runs a structural trade deficit, this is typically offset by substantial services earnings from tourism and large remittance inflows from the diaspora, and the country normally runs a small current-account surplus.http://www.economist.com/countries/Morocco/profile.cfm?folder=Profile- FactSheet Morocco signed in 1996 an agreement of association with the European Union which came into effect in 2000. This agreement, which lies within the scope of the Barcelona Process (Euro-Mediterranean partnership) started in 1995 and envisages the progressive implementation of a free trade area planned for 2012. Trade with the EU Morocco's FTA with the EU, which was signed in 1996, entered into force in 2000 and is being incrementally implemented with the aim of creating an EU-Morocco free trade zone by 2012, noting that the abolition of tariffs on industrial goods has been a boom for Moroccan manufacturers as some 75% of Morocco's exports go to Europe. France is Morocco's largest trading partner, followed by Spain. =Trade with France= France is Morocco‚Äôs largest trading partner for both imports and exports, controlling more than 60% of foreign direct investment in Morocco. Morocco has emerged as a major cheap-labour platform for European manufacturers, as well as a commercial trans-shipment point for goods from all around the world passing through the Straits of Gibraltar. Moroccans‚Äô knowledge of French has also led French banking and call-centre firms to set up service operations in Morocco. In October 2007, French President Nicolas Sarkozy travelled to Morocco on an official state visit to King Mohammed VI. Accompanied by 70 top French business executives, Sarkozy confirmed several billion dollars' worth of contracts for French firms in Morocco. Trade with the US Moroccan-US trade has risen to $2.3 billion in 2007 from the $1.4 billion since the enforcement of the free trade agreement signed between the 2 countries in 2006, former Moroccan Minister of Trade and Economy Salaheddine Mezouar said in 2007. Mezouar pointed out that Moroccan clothing exports to the USA had increased by 122% in 2006 while perfume sales had grown by 41%, also noting that US investment in Morocco exceeded $1.5 billion, mainly in tourism and clothing. In 2006, Moroccan-US trade was up 44% over 2005. Moroccan exports to the US netted $521.2 million while American exports to Morocco reached $875.5 million, up 67% from 2005. According to the FTA agreement, Morocco can export to the US a duty-free quota of 15 million square meters of finished goods and 500 tonnes of thread and materials made from fibres and cotton from less developed Sub-Saharan African countries. Morocco is looking to expand its textile markets outside the EU due to strong competition after the EU abolished quotas for Asian textiles in January 2005.http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/newsbriefs/general/2007/05/16/newsbrief-01 Moroccan exports to the US rose by 25% in 2007, and noted that trade has been facilitated and promoted by the FTA between the 2 countries. The establishment of a direct merchant maritime line between Tangier and ports on the US East coast would be an essential step to taking trade to the next level. Trade with China Morocco was the 2nd African country to establish diplomatic ties with China since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. \\"Sino-Moroccan relations have all along developed soundly and stably with friendly cooperation deepening continuously in all fields, thanks to the joint efforts by the leaders and peoples of the 2 countries, no matter how international situation changes,\\"Wu Bangguo, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, said during his meeting with Abdeloughed Radi, president of Morocco's Chamber of Representatives, in 2005. In trade and economic cooperation, the volume of bilateral trade has increased incessantly, reaching $1.16 billion US dollars in 2004,\\"Wu said. Nothing marked results in bilateral cooperation such as in traditional fields like fisheries, agriculture, health and engineering projects. The heads of the parliaments of China and Morocco vowed in Rabat in 2005 to work for the further development of bilateral ties in all fields, including trade.http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/zflt/eng/zxxx/t210622.htm Trade with the Persian Gulf Region As part of its economic liberalization policy, Morocco has concluded free trade agreements with GCC countries, thereby lining Morocco with 1 of the largest free trade networks in the world and giving it duty-free access to a huge market.http://memrieconomicblog.org/bin/content.cgi?article=190 Trade with Africa Morocco's trade with the African countries has jumped from $533 million in 1998 to around $3 billion in 2008, up 460%. This was facilitated thanks to opening by Morocco's carrier, Royal Air Maroc, of 27 links serving the continent's major cities as well as the existence in Africa of a number of Moroccan operators, especially Royal Air Maroc, mobile operator Maroc Telecom and Attijariwafa Bank.  Trade Imbalance  Morocco's trade imbalance rose from $86 billion to $118 billion dirhams between 2006 and 2007 ‚Äì a 26.6% increase bringing the total amount to 17% of GDP. The Caisse de d√©p√¥t et de gestion forecasts that if imports continue to rise faster than exports, the disparity could reach 21% of GDP. Foreign Trade Minister Abdellatif Ma√¢zouz said earlier in September that members of the government have agreed to a plan focused on four major areas: a concerted export development strategy, the regulation of imports, market and economic monitoring, and the adaptation of regulations and working practices. The plan, Ma√¢zouz said, \\"will enable us to redress the external trade situation and to reduce Morocco‚Äôs trade deficit.\\" The minister added that he expects to see a reversal of the imbalance by 2010.http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2008/09/22/feature-02 See also *Economy of Morocco *Investment in Morocco *Bank Al-Maghrib *Economy of Tangier  References  Economy of Morocco Trade by country ","title":"Trade in Morocco"},{"id":"20612766","text":"Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Symptoms Symptoms include cough, difficulty breathing, and fatigue. Causes It has been suggested that idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia has an autoimmune mechanism, and is a possible complication of undifferentiated connective tissue disease; however, not enough research has been done at this time to find a cause. Patients with NSIP will often have other unrelated lung diseases like COPD or emphysema, along with other auto-immune disorders. Diagnosis A full clinical diagnosis can only be made from a lung biopsy of the tissue, fully best performed by a VATS, done by a cardio-thoracic surgeon. Some pulmonologists may first attempt a bronchoscopy; however, this frequently fails to give a full or correct diagnosis. Lung biopsies performed on patients with NSIP reveal two different disease patterns ‚Äì cellular and fibrosing ‚Äì which are associated with different prognoses. The cellular pattern displays chronic inflammation with minimal fibrosis. The fibrosing pattern displays interstitial fibrosis with various inflammation levels. Both patterns are uniform and lack the prominent fibroblastic foci that are found in other types of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.  Treatment  Commonly used drugs include prednisone, imuran, and cellcept. For active cases of pneumonia for these patients, Levaquin is a commonly used antibiotic. Almost all patients with NSIP will be on oxygen. Prognosis The fibrosing pattern of NSIP has a five-year survival rate of 86% to 92%, while the cellular pattern of NSIP has a 100% five year survival rate. Patients with NSIP (whether cellular or fibrosing), have a better prognosis than those with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).

The TDOA has two main divisions. The Technical Assistance Group is responsible for the protection of archaeological sites and artifacts on all lands owned or controlled by the state. This group also provides technical assistance for state agencies (including State Parks), law enforcement, municipalities, development communities, and the general public. Assistance is offered to public and private entities on legal and technical aspects of prehistoric Native American cemetery relocation and related concerns. This group also conducts research and publishes reports on archaeological subjects, some of which are available for free download via the Division of Archaeology website. The Site File and Review Group maintains accurate records on all known archaeological sites in the state, and coordinates with state agencies to assess impacts of proposed activities on known or suspected sites. This group also provides expertise to the State Historic Preservation Office by reviewing all federally funded projects within Tennessee to determine their impact on archaeological resources. The TDOA presently employs eight archaeologists, a site files coordinator, and an administrative secretary at the Nashville location. An auxiliary storage facility is located at Pinson Mounds State Park near Jackson, Tennessee. Each January, the TDOA, in conjunction with the Middle Tennessee State University Department of Sociology and Anthropology, co- sponsors the Current Research in Tennessee Archaeology meeting. The meeting is open to the public and features presentations by both professional and avocational archaeologists.  History of the TDOA  Prior to the creation of the Tennessee Division of Archaeology (TDOA) in 1970, there had been State Archaeologists, but no state organization that was tasked with watching over Tennessee's archaeology sites. The first official State Archaeologist was Parmenio E. Cox , who was appointed to the role by Governor Austin Peay in 1924 after the death of William Edward Myer, who had served as the unofficial state archaeologist. Cox held the role until he died in 1932. The TDOA was established in 1970 under the Department of Conservation through the \\"Tennessee Antiquities Act\\" (TCA 11-6-101-121), and the first staff members were hired in 1972, with Mack S. Prichard being appointed to the role of State Archaeologist in 1971. The TDOA had a very small budget when it was first created, which only allowed for the hiring of an assistant, which was Patti Coats. Prichard was able to secure additional funds and then hired three regional archaeologists and a Historical Archaeologist in 1972. These included Brian Butler (who oversaw the eastern part of the state,) John Broster (who oversaw the west), Carl Kuttruff (who oversaw Middle Tennessee), and Joe Benthall (who served as the first Historical Archaeologist). Benthall became the state archaeologist after Mack Prichard retired in 1973 and Sam Smith was then hired to take over as the Historical Archaeologist. Patti Coats was also moved into the new position of Site Files Curator during this time. The Division experienced some structural changes during the late 1970s, which merged them with the TN State Parks Department. The position of State Archaeologist was eliminated at this time and Joseph Benthall was moved to a regional archaeologist position. Historical Archaeologist Sam Smith served as the acting State Archaeologist during this period. This merger was short- lived, however, with the TDOA again becoming its own Division in 1983 with the appointment of a new State Archaeologist, Nick Fielder, by Commissioner Charles A. Howell. Fielder had been serving as the first State Historic Preservation Office Archaeologist since 1976. He served as State Archaeologist until 2007, when he retired. Mike Moore then became the State Archaeologist in 2007 and still holds the position today. In 1991, the Department of Conservation merged with the Environment side of the former Department of Health and Environment to become the Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC). The TDOA is still a Division of TDEC. State-wide field projects have comprised an important Division mandate since the beginning. Significant investigations on state-owned properties include Mound Bottom, Sellars Farm, Pinson Mounds, Fort Loudoun, Ft. Pillow, Riverbend Prison, SR-42 (Algood), Hiwassee Old Town, Sandbar Village, Carter House (Williamson County), Spencer Youth Center, Special Needs Prison, Middle TN Veterans Cemetery, Bicentennial Mall, and Ropers Knob. Select site investigations on non-state lands include Brick Church Pike Mound, Fort Southwest Point, First Hermitage, Yearwood, Penitentiary Branch, Fort Blount, Brandywine Pointe, Coats-Hines Mastodon, Johnson, Old Town, Gordontown, Austin Cave, Carson-Conn- Short, Rutherford-Kizer, Brentwood Library, Moss-Wright and collaborative investigations along the Cumberland River near Nashville following the 2010 floods. Thematic historic site surveys (such as potteries, gunmaking, Highland Rim iron industry, Civil War, World War II, Rosenwald Schools, and Trail of Tears) have also been an important component of TDOA research. Reconnaissance surveys for prehistoric sites have been conducted within the Obion, Duck, Cumberland, Harpeth, Caney Fork, Collins, Calfkiller, and Hiwassee/Ocoee River watersheds. The Division‚Äôs ability to perform larger-scale site excavations has significantly diminished over the years due to the same position reductions experienced by other state agencies. Division positions have been cut roughly 70% over the past 25 years, from about 35 positions during the mid-1980s to the current 10 positions. Most of the eliminated positions were part-time/seasonal posts used to employ project field crews. As a result, the TDOA now focuses on smaller-scale survey and site investigations, and also responds to emergency situations as possible.

With this feat, he became one of only few basketball players to have scored over 100 points in a single game. Salvador would later attribute his achievement to excellent conditioning, recounting that for a whole year prior to that game, he had practiced daily at the YMCA compound in Manila, using a medicine ball which he would throw repeatedly to acclimatize his body. He confessed to finding ease at his achievement during the game itself, owing to his daily practice routine. Bodabil and film career Beginning in 1925, Salvador would make appearances in the Manila bodabil (vaudeville) stage under the name Chipipoy, and also as Van Ludor . His sister Miami was also a bodabil performer. It was after World War II that Salvador attained the most influence in the Philippine entertainment scene. He became the most successful stage show impresario in the Philippines, organizing bodabil troupes that toured the country.Zafra, p. 316 Dubbed as \\"The Master Showman\\", he was credited with discovering and fostering the careers of such noted singers and comedians as Chiquito, Bentot, Cachupoy, Canuplin, Pepe Pimentel, Diomedes Maturan, and Eddie Peregrina. Salvador also dabbled in films and established his own production company, Master Films. He was a featured cast member of Manuel Conde's Genghis Khan (1950), which was entered into competition in the Venice Film Festival in 1952. Salvador also directed the feature films Bad Boy (1957) and Barkada (1958), which both starred his son, Lou Salvador Jr. The Lou Salvador Sr. Memorial Award is handed out by the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences in his honor.

It was built between 1783 and 1798, is a highly significant example of late 18th century, early Federal architecture. It is a rectangular, two story, five bay, clapboarded frame dwelling with one-story additions to each end. The house's landscape features include a series of two terraced falls. History Acquinsicke takes its name from a tract of escheat land patented by Anthony Neale in 1704.Patents, DD#5:240 (Annapolis). Originally known as White's Ford and renamed Acquinsicke by Neale, the had formerly been granted to Jerome White in 1669. White had immigrated to Maryland from England as a free adult about 1661. A Catholic, apparently well educated, he held a number of important and influential positions, including that of deputy governor in 1669 and the colony's Surveyor General, 1661‚Äì1671. White received land grants totaling more than ‚Äî most of which reverted to the Lords Baltimore Edward C. Papenfuse, et al., A Biographical Dictionary of the Maryland Legislature, 1635‚Äì1789, 2 Vols. (Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 2:882. when White died in England intestate and without heirs in 1677. The White's Ford grc: of was one of those that es cheated to the proprietor. When the tract was resurveyed for Anthony Neale the boundaries were found to embrace more than the stipulated in White's grant. To correct this discrepancy. Neale was requested to \\" ... leave out the surplus age where [he] should think convenient . .. \\" Patents; DD#5:240. The origin of the name Anthony Neale gave to the property is not precisely known. It is known to have derived from a word or descriptive term used by Native Americans who continued to occupy this section of Charles County at the time that Neale patented the property. It may even have been the name of a small village that once existed on or near the land. Anthony Neale's patent was recorded in 1706 and it was probably not long afterward that he established Acquinsicke as his dwelling plantation. Previous to that time he is believed to have lived on part of his father's plantation, Wollaston Manor, in the southeastern section of the county.Harry Wright Newman, Maryland Smoots and Kindred Families (Baltimore Maryland Historical Society, 1956), pp. 290. Neale's father, Capt. James Neale, was a highly educated and well-travelled member of colonial Maryland society. He first arrived in Maryland in 1635 but did not establish formal residence in the colony until 1642 . A planter and assemblyman. James Neale held a number of provincial offices, and between 1649 and 1659 served as ambassador for Charles II and the Duke of York in Spain and Portugal.Papenfuse, et al., 2:609. The Neales were staunch Roman Catholics and continued to be openly so throughout the 1691‚Äì1776 period when Catholics in Maryland were denied their basic civil rights. Anthony Neale's parents and their descendants established and supported a private mission at Wollaston Manor,J. Richard Rivoire, \\"St. Mary's Church, Newport\\" (Charles County) National Register nomination form, 1991. and Anthony Neale is said to have supported the work of the Church by providing his home at Acquinsicke Society of Jesus headquartered at as a mission chapel of the St. Thomas Manor (CH-6;NR).Margaret Brown Klapthor and Paul D. Brown, History of Charles County, Maryland (LaPlata, Maryland: Charles County Tercentenary, 1958), p.68; Jack D. Brown, et al., Charles County, Maryland, A History (LaPlata, Maryland: Charles County Bicentennial Committee, 1976), p.111. Anthony Neale died in 1723. His will devised one-half of the Acquinsicke plantation to his son Edward stipulating that \\"...it be that moiety whereon my dwelling house stands that I now live in.\\" Edward was also given \\"...my silver Chalice & suit[e] of Church Stuff to be kept and remained in my said Dwelling House and to go from heir to heir for the use of our family etc. so long as any of mine shall inhabit in the said place.\\" Edward's share of Acquinsicke was to lie south of and include the dwelling; his brother, Charles, was bequeathed the part of the plantation lying north of the dwelling together with \\"...one thousand foot of one inch pine plank to be used towards ... building him a house ...\\"Wills, AB#3:166(LaPlata). By the standards of the period, Neale clearly enjoyed a privileged lifestyle, despite the fact that the inventory of his personality suggested that his house was probably of only two rooms with small sleeping chamber above. Although he did own a \\"house clock, a small library of books. assorted pieces of silver, a violin and 5 packs of playing cards\\", his house was as modestly furnished as it was small. Nevertheless, this was true of nearly all dwellings occupied by those of Neale's stature. The estate, which included 33 slaves, was estimated to be worth over 1.108 pounds sterling, placing Neale among the county's wealthier inhabitants.Inventories, 1717‚Äì1735:327 (LaPlata). Neale also owned several other valuable properties, including a mill seat and two unimproved lots in Chandlers Town (Port Tobacco;NR) in the same county.Wills, AB#3:166 Edward Neale was probably living at the home plantation at the time of his father's death, and is known to have continued to reside there until the mid-1740s when he moved to Queen Anne's County on Maryland's Eastern Shore.Archives of Maryland, XLVI:140-142; Court Proceedings, 1812‚Äì1814:2 (LaPlata) According to several local histories, Acquinsicke continued to be used as a place of worship for local Catholics throughout Neale's occupation of the land. In 1751 Edward Neale, who had no surviving sons, conveyed the of Acquinsicke he had inherited from his father, plus an additional contiguous tract of he patented under the name Acquinsicke Enlarged to his eldest daughter Eleanor and her husband Henry Rozer of Prince George's County.Deeds, Z#2:502 (LaPlata); Patents, PL#7:273 (Annapolis). Eleanor and Henry Rozer were then living at Notley Hall, a large estate binding on the Potomac River near present-day Fort Washington which Henry had inherited from his father Notley Rozer.Effie Gwynn Bowie, Across the Years in Prince George's County (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Company, report, 1975), p.571. Seven years later Charles Neale, Edward's brother, sold his half share of Acquinsicke to Col. Samuel Hanson Deeds, G#3:177 (LaPlata) necessitating a formally surveyed division of the two parts of the original tract they had inherited on their father's death in 1723. Historical context Acquinsicke was built in the last two decades of the 18th century, a very important time of transition in the development of domestic architecture in Southern Maryland. From about 1720 until the end of the American Revolution housing forms in Southern Maryland were fairly unchanged- homes of the middle and lower economic classes were usually one-story with one or two lower rooms and small attic chambers above, while those of the more prosperous merchant planters almost invariably contained four rooms off a centered rear stair hall and with bed chambers within a gable or gambrel roof. Surviving buildings combined with historical research has provided convincing evidence that houses with central through passages and houses of a full two-story height were relatively rare before the close of the 18th century. It was not until about the second decade of the 19th century, when improved economic conditions spawned a building boom that continued well into the 1840s, that two-story dwellings with central or side passages extending the full depth of the house became increasingly common. Similarly, changing fashions in a broader American context was slow to influence local architectural trends. Consequently, there are remarkably few late-18th-century houses in Charles County whose architectural embellishments reflect to any significant degree the neoclassicism so widely embraced elsewhere in the decades following the Revolutionary War. The land on which Acquinsicke stands is part of what was once one of Charles County's largest plantations and was initially established by Anthony Neale, member of one of Maryland's most historically important Catholic families. Neale's dwelling, which is believed to have stood on or near the site of the present house, was used as both a private residence and as a mission chapel of the Society of Jesus headquartered at St. Thomas Manor INRI. The survival and growth of Catholicism in Maryland during the 1690‚Äì1116 period was almost entirely dependent on the support of these mission chapels by families such as the Neales. All of these mission chapels have disappeared, and the precise locations of nearly all of them remains unknown. Today, only St. Thomas Manor and the property encompassing St. Mary's Church, Newport INRI have documented associations with the pre-1776 history of Roman Catholicism in this area, and Acquinsicke is the only extant non-church owned site to have historically proven associations with the missionary activities of the society of Jesus in this locality . Aquinsicke is currently privately owned. Impact Acquinsicke is a very significant example of late 18th century, early Federal architecture. Remarkably enough, only a few examples of domestic architectural farms survive in this region that illustrate as well as Acquinsicke the transitional phase between entirely vernacular building traditions and those buildings whose overall designs and carpentry were obviously influenced by outside sources. In this sense, Acquinsicke's full two-story height, one-room-deep design, finished (and heated!) attic chambers, and intrepidly corbelled and plaster banded chimney stacks are of specific note. Viewed independently, each of these details is unique in a late 18th- century architectural context: Together, they establish Acquinsicke as entirely matchless. Acquinsicke is also of significance for the historical connection of the site it occupies with the history of Roman Catholicism in Southern Maryland. There is compelling historical evidence that the house rests on or immediately next to the site of an earlier structure that from about 1706 until at least the middle of that century served the dual function of private home and mission chapel served by Jesuits headquartered at St. Thomas Manor. Acquinsicke is one of only three sites in Charles County with documented affiliations with the pastoral activities of the Roman Catholic Church during the 1690‚Äì1776 period when Catholics in Maryland were denied their basic civil rights.

Although Family Guy was initially canceled in 2000 due to low ratings, following a last-minute reprieve, the series returned for a third season in 2001. The series was canceled again in 2002; however, high ratings on Adult Swim and high DVD sales renewed Fox's interest in the series. The series returned for a total of 30 new episodes in 2005.

In 2002, the series was canceled again after three seasons due to low ratings. Fox attempted to sell the rights for reruns of the show, but it was difficult to find networks that were interested; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, \\" basically for free\\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television Production. When the reruns were shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim in 2003, Family Guy became Adult Swim's most-watched show with an average 1.9 million viewers an episode. Following Family Guys high ratings on Adult Swim, the first two seasons were released on DVD in April 2003. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best- selling television DVD of 2003 and the second highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's Chappelle's Show. The third season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show's popularity in both DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest in it. They ordered 35 new episodes in 2004, marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales. Fox president Gail Berman said that it was one of her most difficult decisions to cancel the show, and was therefore happy it would return. The network also began production of a film based on the series. Dan Povenmire, who became a director on Family Guy during the series' second season, took a more prominent role in directing by the third season, having directed five episodes. Creator Seth MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom. Povenmire recalled that MacFarlane would tell him \\"We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags.

Life Rivet was born at Saint-Maixent, 43 km (27 mi) southwest of Poitiers, France. After completing his education at Berne, he studied theology privately at Berne and La Rochelle, and from 1595 to 1620 was at Thouars, first as chaplain of the duke of La Tr√©mouille and later as pastor. In 1617 he was elected president of the Synod at Vitr√©; and in 1620 he was called to Leiden as professor of theology. In 1632 Stadholder Frederick Henry appointed Rivet tutor of his son, later William II, while the university made him honorary professor. In 1641 he attended the prince on his visit to England. In 1645 he exchanged letters with Dorothy Durie concerning the roles for women in the church. In 1646 was appointed as the first Rector of the new Orange College of Breda, where he passed the remainder of his life and died. Archibald Alexander devotes a chapter of his Thoughts on Religious Experience to Rivet's \\"death- bed exercises\\". Works A learned Reformed theologian (or, less accurately, a Calvinist) and a relentless apologist of the Reformed faith against the attacks of the Roman Catholic Church, Rivet was in his day the most influential member of the theological faculty of Leyden; and together with his colleagues he drew up, in 1625, the Synopsis purioris theologiae, a series of 52 academic disputations covering the main topics of Reformed theology. At Leyden Rivet also worked in the field Old Testament exegesis. His numerous writings are divided among polemics, exegesis, dogmatics, and edification. They were collected in three volumes (Rotterdam, 1651‚Äì53), one of the most notable being the Isagoge ad scripturam sacram Veteris et Novi Testamenti (Dort, 1616).

Fox had ordered five episode scripts at the end of the third season; these episodes had been written but not produced. One of these scripts was adapted into \\"North by North Quahog\\". The original script featured Star Wars character Boba Fett, and later actor, writer and producer Aaron Spelling, but the release of the iconic film The Passion of the Christ inspired the writers to incorporate Mel Gibson into the episode. Multiple endings were written, including one in which Death comes for Gibson. During production, an episode of South Park was released entitled \\"The Passion of the Jew\\" that also featured Gibson as a prominent character. This gave the Family Guy writers pause, fearing accusations \\" that we had ripped them off.\\" Episodes Reception = Ratings = This season received high Nielsen ratings; \\"North by North Quahog\\", the premiere episode was broadcast as part of an animated television night on Fox, alongside two episodes of The Simpsons and the pilot episode of American Dad!. The episode was watched by 11.85 million viewers, the show's highest ratings since the airing of the first season episode \\"Brian: Portrait of a Dog\\". Its ratings also surpassed the ratings of both episodes of The Simpsons and American Dad!. Season four's three-part finale was watched by 8.2 million viewers, bringing the season average to 7.9 million viewers per episode. = Awards and nominations = This season was nominated for a number of awards. In 2005, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences nominated \\"North by North Quahog\\" for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour). It nominated \\"PTV\\" in the same category one year later. Neither of the episodes won the award, as South Park received the award in 2005 and The Simpsons was the eventual recipient of the award in 2006. Peter Shin and Dan Povenmire were both nominated for an Annie Award in the Best Directing in an Animated Television Production category, for directing \\"North by North Quahog\\" and \\"PTV\\" respectively; Shin eventually won the award. MacFarlane won the Annie Award for Best Voice-over Performance for providing the voice of Stewie in \\"Brian the Bachelor\\". At the Annie Awards the following year, John Viener was nominated in the category Writing in an Animated Television Production, for writing \\"Untitled Griffin Family History\\", but lost the award to Ian Maxtone-Graham, who wrote the episode of The Simpsons titled \\"The Seemingly Neverending Story\\". The editors of the episode \\"Blind Ambition\\" won the Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing in Television Animated. = Critical reception = Season 4 received positive reviews from critics. Reviewing the season premiere, Mark McGuire of The Times Union wrote: \\"... the first minute or so of the resurrected Family Guy ranks among the funniest 60 seconds I've seen so far this season.\\" The Pitt News reviewer John Nigro felt that the show had not lost its steam while it was on hiatus, and was surprised that the show had been canceled because of its \\"wildly extravagant shock factor\\". Nigro cited \\"Breaking Out Is Hard to Do\\", \\"Petarded\\" and \\"Perfect Castaway\\" as the season's best episodes. In 2007, BBC Three named the episode \\"PTV\\" \\"The Best Episode...So Far\\". The episode has also been praised by Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune, who called it \\"Family Guys most rebellious outing yet\\". The Boston Globe critic Matthew Gilbert felt Family Guys fourth season was as \\"crankily irreverent as ever\\". Fewer critics responded negatively to the season; Seattle Post-Intelligencer critic Melanie McFarland reacted very bitterly, stating \\"Three years off the air has not made the Family Guy team that much more creative\\". Critics of both PopMatters and IGN criticized the first few episodes but felt the show regained its humor after \\"Don't Make Me Over\\"; IGN's Mike Drucker commented \\"At that point, we get some amazingly creative humor. It's almost like MacFarlane and gang decided they had thanked their fans enough and could return to what made the show successful in the first place.\\" Media watchdog group the Parents Television Council, a frequent critic of the show, branded the episodes \\"North by North Quahog\\", \\"The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz\\", \\"Brian Sings and Swings\\", \\"Patriot Games\\", and \\"The Courtship of Stewie's Father\\" as \\"worst show of the week\\".

From their beginnings as a Latin America specialist in South America and Central America land tours, they have grown to now offer trips around the globe including less conventional destinations such as Africa, the Arctic, Antarctica and Alaska. Their focus is nature, cultural, and active travel, and they apply ecotourism principles to their tour and cruise programs. Most trips have a maximum group size of 12, yet typically run with 6 or fewer travelers. A large portion of travelers arrange customized or private itineraries. Since their founding in 1999, over 24,000 clients have traveled with the company. Adventure Life is registered in the State of Montana as ALJ, Inc., and they do business as Adventure Life. History Adventure Life was founded by Brian Morgan in 1999. Morgan was working as a consultant in Quito for CARE in the late 1990s, but decided to return home to Montana. While applying for jobs in Montana, Morgan planned a group tour back to Ecuador and promoted it locally. This experience made him recognize that guided tours were a service in demand, and a niche industry that his own travel experiences and Ecuadorian connections had prepared him to explore further. Adventure Life launched in February 1999 with Spanish language study-trips, internships, and tours to Peru and Ecuador. Office was initially located in Havre, Montana, and Morgan hired the first staff member. During the first year of business, Adventure Life had fewer than 100 travelers. Starting in 2000, the company decided to focus on only offering tours and no longer provides Spanish language study-trips or internships. The office moved from Havre and settled in Missoula, Montana. By the end of 2000, the company hires four full-time staff members. The company established a partner office in Lima, Peru. Between 2001-2003, Adventure Life added tours to Bolivia, Costa Rica and Belize, Chile, Argentina, Patagonia and Guatemala. The company also established a second partner office in Quito, Ecuador. The company moved from Morgan's home into its first office. In 2005, tours started sending travelers to Antarctica, and in 2006 they added Panama to the list of destinations. During 2007-2008 Adventure Life began offering small-ship cruises throughout the world. During 2007, Adventure Life provides trips for over 3500 travelers. In 2008 the Falkland Islands were added to tour options. Company launches an online community forum offering traveler Trip Journals - the system utilizes the services of Google Maps. In 2009 Nicaragua is added, and in 2011 Uruguay is added. In 2012, Mexico and Colombia trips were added to Adventure Life's selection. Brazil and Africa were added in 2013, further broadening destination options for travelers. The growing company of Adventure Life moved into a new office building near downtown Missoula at the end of 2012. Responsible travel Galapagos Conservation Fundraising Adventure Life is an active member of the International Galapagos Tour Operators Association, (IGTOA).igtoa.org The president of Adventure Life, Brian Morgan, served as the president of IGTOA from 2006-2009. In Nov. 2006, IGTOA they launched a Galapagos traveler-funding program for island conservation, and Adventure Life was one of the first members to adopt this initiative. A voluntary donation is added to all of Adventure Life's Galapagos travelers‚Äô invoices. 40% of this donation goes to IGTOA and 60% goes to the Charles Darwin Foundation. Dollar for dollar, Adventure Life matches these donations with travel vouchers for future trips with their company. Since its inception, Adventure Life‚Äôs travelers have raised over $100,000 for island conservation. IGTOA supports program in the Galapagos that include both Conservation and Professional Standards. Conservation funding is for projects that directly impact issues like introduced species, patrol of the park, and scientific research. Professional Standards relates to boat safety; passenger care; training and treatment of captains and crew members; guide training; educating travelers on conservation issues; and other issues relating to health, safety, and the rights and responsibilities of both travelers and tourist industry personnel. The Charles Darwin Foundation (CDF) has carried out research for the conservation of the Galapagos ecosystem for almost 50 years. They have been a leader in conservation science and the practical application of information gained and lessons learned in Galapagos, and are one of the most respected non-profit research organizations currently in operation. Center for Traditional Textiles of Cusco (CTTC) The CTTC is a non-profit organization established in 1996 to aid in the survival of Incan textile traditions and to provide support to weaving communities. Working with the Center, Quechua weavers and their families in the region of the former Incan capitol are engaged in skills-building, community networking and market development. By researching and documenting complex styles and techniques of the ancestors, the Center helps to ensure that 2,000-year-old textiles traditions will not be lost to future generations. Adventure Life provides an annual donation to the CTTC, and incorporates visits to the center for all of its Peru itineraries that spend time in the Cusco region. Adventure Life Grant Program Adventure Life community grants provide funding for grassroots projects in the countries the company operates tours. These grants fund such projects as reforestation efforts, youth festivals and education, operations at a women's shelter, a school science lab, reconstruction of buildings, village irrigation systems, sanitation systems, and a conservation of traditional handicraft techniques.

The Act originated from a piece of legislation proposed during the late 19th century. Marriages solemnized under Special Marriage Act are not governed by personal laws. In 1872 Act III, 1872 was enacted but later it was found inadequate for certain desired reforms, and Parliament enacted a new legislation. Henry Sumner Maine first introduced Act III of 1872, which would permit any dissenters to marry whomever they chose under a new civil marriage law. In the final wording, the law sought to legitimize marriages for those willing to renounce their profession of faith altogether (\\"I do not profess the Hindu, Christian, Jewish, etc. religion\\"). It can apply in inter- caste and inter-religion marriages.http://blog.ipleaders.in/10-things-every- indian-should-know-about-the-special-marriage-act1954/ Overall, the response from local governments and administrators was that they were unanimously opposed to Maine's Bill and believed the legislation encouraged marriages based on lust, which would inevitably lead to immorality.Perveez Mody, \\"Love and the Law: Love-Marriage in Delhi,\\" Modern Asian Studies 36:1 (2002): 223-256 The Special Marriage Act, 1954 replaced the old Act III, 1872. The new enactment has 3 major objectives: # To provide a special form of marriage in certain cases, # to provide for registration of certain marriages and, # to provide for divorce. Applicability # Any person, irrespective of religion. # Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, Christians, Parsis, or Jews can also perform marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. # Inter-religion marriages are performed under this Act. # This Act is applicable to the entire territory of India and extends to intending spouses who are both Indian nationals living abroad. # Indian national living abroad. Requirements # The marriage performed under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 is a civil contract and accordingly, there need be no rites or ceremonial requirements. # The parties have to file a Notice of Intended Marriage in the specified form to the Marriage Registrar of the district in which at least one of the parties to the marriage has resided for a period of not less than thirty days immediately preceding the date on which such notice is given. # After the expiration of thirty days from the date on which notice of an intended marriage has been published, the marriage may be solemnised, unless it has been objected to by any person. # The marriage may be solemnised at the specified Marriage Office. # Marriage is not binding on the parties unless each party states \\"I, (A), take thee (B), to be my lawful wife (or husband),\\" in the presence of the Marriage Officer and three witnesses. Conditions for marriage # Each party involved should have no other subsisting valid marriage. In other words, the resulting marriage should be monogamous for both parties. # The groom must be at least 21 years old; the bride must be at least 18 years old. # The parties should be competent in regard to their mental capacity to the extent that they are able to give valid consent for the marriage. # The parties should not fall within the degree of prohibited relationship. Court Marriage is a union of two soul where oath ceremony is performed according to Special Marriage Act-1954 before the Registrar of Marriage in the presence of three witnesses thereafter a court marriage certificate is issued directly by the Registrar of Marriage appointed by the Govt. of India.

Research was also presented in M√©moires sur l'√âgypte, which was published in four volumes between 1798‚Äì1801. On 22 November 1799, the Institut took the decision to collect and publish its scholarly work as the Description de l'√âgypte. The Institut lasted until its 47th and final meeting on 21 March 1801. The Egyptian Society The Institut d'√âgypte's activities resumed in 1836 under the name of The Egyptian Society. The work was carried out by French, German and English scholars. It was transferred to Alexandria in 1859, and its name was again changed, this time to Institut √âgyptien. The new Institut functioned under the auspices of Egypt's viceroy Sa'id Pasha, and had several prominent members, notably the German botanist Georg August Schweinfurth, as well as Egyptologists Auguste Mariette and Gaston Maspero. Later members included Ahmed Kamal, Egypt's first native Egyptologist, as well as Ahmad Zaki Pasha, a pioneering philologist. The Institut returned to Cairo in 1880. Its previous name was made official by a royal decree in 1918. Henceforth, it was directly under the Royal Palace's auspices. Some of the Institut's more recent members include famed scholar Taha Hussein. Destruction The Institute in January 2012.The Institute was burnt down on 17 December 2011, as a consequence of continued street clashes in the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution that had erupted on 25 January 2011. Opposing groups of protesters were engaged in street clashes, hurling flammable materials at each other adjacent to the Shura Council building when a Molotov cocktail, either thrown accidentally or deliberately, penetrated one of the windows of the Institute causing a massive fire. Fire brigade units were unable to promptly reach the scene of the blaze because of continued chaotic conditions on the streets. Volunteers, protesters from opposing factions, rushed into the burning building and were able to save many items and bring them to safety. Before the blaze, the repository had held over 200,000 rare and antiquarian books and texts, many dating from the Napoleonic era. A first estimate says that only 30,000 volumes have been saved.Un incendio durante los disturbios de El Cairo destruye el original de la 'Descripci√≥n de Egipto' encargada por Napole√≥n ( ) Lost, however, were the Atlas of Lower and Upper Egypt (1752), the Atlas Handler (1842), the Atlas of the Old Indian Arts and many other important works. It was incorrectly reported in the press that the original 20-volume manuscript Description de l'√âgypte (1809‚Äì29) was destroyed during these events. The majority of these volumes reside at the National Archives and the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, in Paris, France. Professor Mahmoud l-Shernoby, the general secretary of the institute, told that the damage is a \\"great loss\\" to Egypt and that those \\"who caused this disaster should be punished\\".Amid army crackdown, Egypt‚Äôs richest library set on fire ( )A black day for heritage: burning the Egyptian Scientific Institute( ) Renovations Sheikh Sultan al Qassimi, ruler of the emirate of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, had indicated his willingness to bear the cost of reconstruction of the building and to donate some of his own rare possessions to it Other works that might be made available include various copies of the Description available in other countries.

It is a -story gable-roofed house of common bond brick, built about 1850. The house has a basic Georgian plan. It is the only brick house in Charles County dating between the years 1835 and 1880. The house was built by Francis Caleb Green, on part of the of land granted in 1666 to the sons of Thomas Greene, the second Provincial Governor of Maryland, who named it \\"Green's Inheritance.\\" Green's Inheritance, formerly known as \\"Green Park\\", and home to the wealthy and prominent branch of the Green Family of Charles County, is a simple but dignified 2 1/2-story gable roofed house of common bond brick, 56' by 36'. Built c. 1850, it has a basic Georgian plan, incorporating an interesting combination of late Federal and Greek Revival features. The five-bay principal facade faces southeast. The centered, double- leafed entrance door, with transom and sidelights, has a simple Greek Revival- style wood enframement. The proportions and simplicity of a one-story porch with shallow pedimented roof and square posts sheltering the entrance suggest a Greek Revival influence. The four windows on the first floor and five on the second frame 6/6 sash and have plain wood sills and flat wood lintels. On the latter, at both floor levels, are flat pieces of wood applied in a manner to suggest recessed flat arches within the rectangular lintels, a rather curious treatment that is apparently original. A second interesting feature is a four- course brick belt or panel below the stepped brick roof cornice that extends to within 18\\" of the ends of the house. The north, or rear, elevation repeats the same fenestration and door placement of the front. However, the wood lintels of the windows are unornamented, and there is no belt course or panel below the eave cornice, and no porch sheltering the door. The door, fronted by a semi-circular brick stoop, is framed in the same basic manner as the front, but has a simulated, all-wood overlight. In 1941 a one-story porch extending the full width of this elevation was removed and replaced by the existing brick stoop and brick terrace. The east end of the house is unbroken except for a window at the attic level. On the west side there is a centered window at the second floor. The roof has two flush gable chimneys at each end. On the front and back slopes of the roof are three pedimented dormer windows, each of 6/6 sash. There is no watertable at the base of the house, although at one time the first several courses up from ground level were painted black. Small metal grilled openings at the base of the building serve to ventilate the crawl space beneath the first floor joists. In 1941 a one-story, three-bay kitchen addition of old brick with a shallow gable roof was built against the west end of the house, replacing an older frame wing. Green's Inheritance is an important landmark, regionally significant architecturally and historically. Its architecture and date of construction very nearly make it unique within the lower Southern Maryland region. In about 1825 the counties of Charles, Calvert, St. Mary's, and lower Prince George's began feeling the accumulated effect of a series of economic depressions, the last caused in large measure by the over-cultivation of tobacco, changing agricultural practices, industrialization, and the shifting of a rural society to one more urban. During the two decades preceding and following the Civil War almost all building activity ceased within the region. Green's Inheritance is therefore one of only a handful of extant buildings dating from this period in this area. It is, in fact, the only brick house in Charles County dating between the years 1835 and 1880. Considering the critical economic situation of the region at this time, it is remarkable that anyone could afford such an extravagance, particularly when many families of greater wealth and social prominence were crumbling. The house should then be recognized as a testament to the builder, who buy all accounts was a quiet, honest yet resourceful and imaginative \\"gentleman farmer.\\" The significance of Green's Inheritance, however, lies not only in its architectural value but also in the history of the property and the Green family. The house is believed to have been built about 1850 by Francis Caleb Green, on land granted in 1666 to the sons of Thomas Green, the second Provincial Governor of Maryland. Francis Caleb Green (1795-1851) held the rank of Sergeant during the War of 1812-14, and was actively involved in county affairs. His son, Francis Basil Green (1832-1907), was also active in local affairs, but especially in the concerns of nearby St. Joseph's Church, to which he donated land for expansion. His children sold the house to the late Major General DeWitt Peck, U.S.M.C., in 1941. It was during Peck's tenure that many of the renovations took place. The well-documented affairs of the Green family provide more than a superficial glimpse into the life of an average Maryland family throughout a period of some 250 years. The house, as a part of this record, provides a valuable focal point on which a historical study of socio-economic conditions in Southern Maryland, as reflected by the activities of several generations of a single family, could be based. Green's Inheritance was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977.

He coined the term Bildungsroman. Biography Morgenstern was born in Magdeburg. He studied at the University of Halle under Johann August Eberhard in philosophy and Friedrich August Wolf in philology. In 1802 he moved to Dorpat in Livonia, Russian Empire (now Tartu, Estonia) where he would spend the rest of his life. He held the chair for rhetoric, classical philology, aesthetics, and history of art and literature at the newly refounded University of Dorpat and was the first director of its library. The character of his work changed in Dorpat. He discontinued his Plato studies and wrote about literature, art, philology, and philosophy. Morgenstern's former teacher Friedrich Wolf was disappointed by this development, and he remarked in 1808 that his student was growing more elegant, vain, and boring with the years.Magdeburger Biographisches Lexikon It was in the course of this work that Morgenstern coined \\"Bildungsroman\\". Even after his retirement in 1834 Morgenstern stayed in Dorpat. He bequeathed his 12,000-volume library, containing many manuscripts and a good part of the Kant estate, to the university. Four years after his death a medal was issued in his honor. Of this medal, made by Ferdinand Helfricht in Gotha, seven pieces were issued in silver and 200 in bronze.http://hdl.handle.net/10900/100742 S. Krmnicek und M. Gaidys, Gelehrtenbilder.

State Street, Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The Newtown Hardware House is a contributing property of the Newtown Historic District which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  History  The Newtown Hardware House was built in 1869 by Cyrus Hillborn and Harrison C. Worstall at 106-108 South State Street. 108 South State Street was a hardware store operated by Hillborn and Worstall, and 106 South State Street was a dry goods store operated by George E. Dolton. Mr. Dolton sold his side to George H. McMaster in 1908. When McMaster died in 1927, both sides of the store were taken over by H.C. Worstall, and later bought out by John J. Burns. When Burns died in 1955, Robert M. Davis bought the business and operated it until 1985, when it was taken over by C. David Callahan. In 2012, C. David Callahan sold the business to William Newell of Newtown and remained on as a part-time employee. =Fire= The Newtown Hardware House was destroyed by fire on March 1, 1899. In addition to the Hardware store another store was completely burned. The loss was estimated at $80,000. The fire was one of the worst in Newtown's history. It is thought burglars set the building on fire.\\"Burglars and Incendiaries.\\" The New York Times 2 Mar. 1899: P.5. The building was rebuilt to the exact specifications of the original building and was reopened by Christmas of the same year and is still in operation. Today, when looking at the rear wall, lower left (northern) portion of the structure, a distinct brick line exists that outlines surviving brickwork dating before 1899. =Oldest business in Newton Pennsylvania= The Newtown Hardware House has been in continuous operation for over 151 years, which ranks as the longest tenure for any single business in Newtown.Rounsavill, Brian E.

The hardware store announced it was going out of business in 2012: City residents heard about the possibility that the hardware store may go out of business, so they organized a \\"Cash mob\\": a crowd of people arrived at the business to pump up sales. In 2011 the store was in trouble, and by 2012 the store's owner Dave Callahan decided to go out of business. Bill and Peggy Newell took over the hardware store.

He previously served as both an Assistant Church Historian of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and as managing director of the church's Public Affairs Department. Biography Turley was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Richard and Betty Jean Nickle Turley. His father, a nuclear engineer, scientist and professor, would later become a mission president and general authority of the LDS Church. Turley attended high school in Salt Lake City, Utah, when he met Shirley Swensen. They would later marry in the Salt Lake Temple and have six children. Turley aspired to be a lawyer, by his father's urging, and an Institute of Religion teacher, by his deep personal interest in LDS Church history. From 1975 to 1977, Turley served as an LDS missionary to the Japan Tokyo Mission. After returning from Japan, Turley studied at Brigham Young University (BYU) as a Spencer W. Kimball Scholar, receiving a B. A. in English in 1982. Then, at BYU's J. Reuben Clark Law School, he was editor of the law review and elected to the Order of the Coif. Upon graduation in April 1985, Turley received the Hugh B. Brown Barrister's Award for top classroom performance. =Church employment= After passing the Utah State Bar examination, Turley practiced law briefly before being hired by the LDS Church in January 1986. He was appointed Assistant Managing Director of the Historical Department, to replace the retiring Earl Olson. At this time, the department was already heavily involved in the investigation of Mark Hofmann, the historical documents forger who attempted to hide his fraud by murder during the previous October. Turley's legal training helped the department which had examined and acquired several Hoffman forgeries (though some argued it was to hide their controversy). Watching the case unfold in the press and in books, Turley felt misconceptions lingered from the media frenzy. To tell the story from the perspectives of the murder victims and the LDS Church (which Turley believed had been misrepresented) he published Victims: The LDS Church and the Mark Hofmann Case in 1992 through the University of Illinois Press. Though he wrote the book without church direction, his trusted position granted him church leaders' support and access to interviews, diaries, journals, memoranda, and other records. =Expanded role= Turley was appointed Managing Director of the Historical Department in 1989,John K. Carmack was Managing Director until 1989 (see this article from Encyclopedia of Mormonism), which is when Turley was referred to as Managing Director in and in 1996 he also became Managing Director of the Family History Department. While over the family history department Turley oversaw the launching of familysearch.org. In 2000, the Family History and Church History departments merged into the Family and Church History Department, over which Turley remained as Managing Director. In these roles, Turley oversaw the Church Archives, the Church History Library, and the Museum of Church History and Art, the Family History Library, the FamilySearch Center, the Granite Mountain Records Vault, and over 4,000 branch family history centers. These comprise one of the largest collections of Mormon history, western history, and genealogy in the world. As a person of authority in LDS history and past defender of the church in the Hofmann controversy, Turley later became one of three official LDS Church respondents to a popular 2003 book critical of Mormonism, Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer. =Digital projects= In the department, Turley managed several notable electronic projects. FamilySearch, a massive genealogical database website, was launched in 1999. Other records were also released on CD-ROM, including the Freedman‚Äôs Bank (of African-American records), the Mormon Immigration Index, European Vital Records Indexes, and 1880s censuses, including the 1881 British Census, which won the Besterman/McColvin Award from the Library Association of Great Britain. For these efforts, and restoring several LDS historic sites, Turley received the Historic Preservation Medal from the Daughters of the American Revolution in 2004. In 2002, BYU Press published Selected Collections From the Archives of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which Turley edited. On 74 DVDs, this released numerous important and rare early documents of the church, which some scholars and historians called \\"the most important event in modern Mormon publishing,\\" and \\"an achievement of such significance that no praise, no matter how effusive, seems sufficiently laudatory.\\" =Assistant Church Historian= More changes came to the department after Marlin K. Jensen became Church Historian in 2005. The department again staffed professional researchers, the Joseph Smith Papers Project sharply expanded, and a new Church History Library was announced. On March 12, 2008, the Family and Church History Department announced it was becoming two departments again: the Family History Department and the Church History Department. In addition, Turley became the Assistant Church Historian, an ecclesiastical position that was unfilled for over 25 years. Steven L. Olsen, the department's Associate Managing Director, took Turley's old position of Managing Director. For his contributions to public history while overseeing the church's archives, records, museums, and historic sites, Turley was awarded the 2013 Herbert Feis Award from the American Historical Association. =Public Affairs Department= In April 2016, the church announced that Turley would move from the Church History Department and become the successor to Michael Otterson as the managing director of the church's Public Affiars Department.LDS Newsroom announcement of Turley going to Public Affairs Department leadership The two worked closely together through a transition period until Otterson's departure in August, to accept an assignment as a temple president.Daily Herald article on Turley replacing OttersonSalt Lake Tribune article on Turley's appointmentDeseret News article on Turley's appointment to the Public Affairs Department managing director position Among other events and activities in this new role, Turley traveled to the Philippines in December 2017 where he gave three devotionals on Church History.LDS Newsroom article on Turley's journey to the Philippines Awards In 2017, Turley was given the Mormon Historic Sites Foundation Junius Wells Award.report on Turley receiving award Organizations Turley has been involved with several genealogical and historical organizations. * Historic Sites Committee (LDS Church) * President of the Genealogical Society of Utah (2000‚Äì2008), * The Joseph Smith Papers editorial board * Executive Committee of the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Latter-day Saint History * General editor of The Journals of George Q.

The > sure foundation of faith is spiritual and not physical. ...

The WSTF does not charge dues and has no central governing authority (i.e. board). The WSTF was patterned by its initial creators (BEA Systems, Fujitsu, IBM, and Oracle) after the SoapBuilders mailing list/community. While its main focus is to test the various Web Service specifications, it also serves as a forum where the entire Web Service community can share ideas and concerns in an open fashion.  Principles  The WSTF is founded on the following basic principles: ; Low barriers to participation : the WSTF seeks to be as inclusive as possible. Consequently it does not charge dues or any other form of membership fee. All that is required to join is have the individual or organization sign a Participation Agreement. ; No centralized control : past experience has shown that, if a subset of members is allowed to control what is and isn't tested, they tend to try and direct testing efforts towards technologies and standards that they favor and discourage testing on technologies that, for whatever reason, they do not like. In the WSTF any member is free to propose a scenario, contribute to an existing scenario, or implement a scenario as they choose. ; Interoperability by consensus : many interoperability issues arise either because the relevant specifications simply do not cover a particular area or there are conflicting, but equally valid interpretations of a specification. The WSTF seeks to resolve such cases using a common-sense, consensus approach. ; Independent testing : any test that requires two or more people from separate organizations to participate at the same time is inherently more expensive and complex than a test which can be conducted by one person alone. The WSTF seeks to promote and support testing that does not require the active participation of all the parties involved in the test. For example, the WSTF site provides a directory of all the implementations of a given scenario. These implementations are expected to be long-lived and remain up and working for the benefit of other WSTF members. ; Distribute testing costs : the WSTF provides a shared testbed where the cost of testing is spread out among the members by having each implementation host their own endpoints. This removes the need for each to duplicate this effort themselves in-house.  Scenarios  Unlike other interoperability organizations, the work of the WSTF does not center around individual specifications. Activities are organized around the concept of a \\"Test Scenario\\". Scenarios are made up of three parts: # A high-level use case that describes the problem to be solved and the constraints on that solution. # An architecture that describes the services technologies and standards that will be used to address the problem and how they will be used. # A set of test cases along with the artifacts (WSDL, XML Schema, etc.) necessary to implement those test cases.  Process  Once a scenario has been defined, members of the WSTF may implement it using their products or open source projects. They deploy these implementations onto publicly available systems and test interoperability with each other in a crosswise fashion. Problems and issues are discussed on the WSTF mailing lists. The scenario may need to be clarified or re-factored during this process. Once an implementation reaches a certain level of maturity, and the implementers choose to do so, the scenario and its implementations can be made visible outside the WSTF by publishing it. Whether published or not, the endpoints that provide the scenario implementations are expected to be maintained indefinitely. This allows other members of the WSTF to perform regression testing, test new implementations, verify behavior, etc. without requiring the active participation of the implementer. The WSTF chose to keep most of their work private for a couple of reasons. First, in an entirely public forum the members may not feel as free to bring up sensitive topics. By signing the Participation Agreement, members agree to keep all discussions private to the group - thus allowing for a much more open and honest discussion. Second, the members of the WSTF wanted a \\"WSTF Published\\" scenario to mean that it had broad community support. Without a formal \\"Publish\\" step in the process it would be hard distinguish scenarios that had the community's support versus ones that were only implemented by one company. A scenario can be published when it has five different implementations and at least two-thirds of those implementor choose to make it public. Only members of the WSTF who put up implementations/endpoints of the scenario are eligible to vote. This restriction was done to ensure that only those who \\"have skin in the game\\" are allowed to influence it. For more information on the process see the WSTF's Charter. Regression testing of web service Functional and non- functional web service testing is done with the help of WSDL parsing and regression testing is performed by identifying the changes made thereafter. Web service regression testing needs can be categories into three different ways, namely, changes in WSDL, changes in code, and selective re-testing of web service operations. To capture above three changes three intermediate forms of WSDL, namely, Difference WSDL (DWSDL), Unit WSDL (UWSDL), and Reduced WSDL (RWSDL), respectively can be used. These intermediate forms of WSDLs are then combined to form Combined WSDL (CWSDL) which is further used for regression testing of the web service. This will help in Automatic Web Service Change Management (AWSCM), by performing the selection of the relevant test cases to construct reduced test suite from the old test suite.  Results  The WSTF produces the following artifacts: * The WSTF provides a directory of the endpoints that implement a scenario. The fact that these endpoints are long-lived means that you can re-check the interoperability results at any time. You also can create your own implementation of a scenario and check what you have done against any of the existing endpoints. * Every scenario includes a set of \\"findings\\" for the scenario. These are notes that discuss what was discovered during testing including problems in the underlying specifications, possible work-arounds for problems, etc. * A set of guidelines or best practices on how to address the business case using web services technologies.

Its mission is to promote education and literacy while broadening Americans' understanding of their neighbors, which it achieves by annually sending more than 300,000 books to schools, libraries, churches, and Peace Corps volunteers throughout the developing world and in the United States. The project is based in Lexington, Kentucky, in a warehouse it has owned since 1983. History Harriet Drury Van Meter visited India in 1965 by invitation of the United States Department of State. While in India, she witnessed long lines of people waiting just to borrow a book to study from. She returned to Kentucky and placed an inquiry in the English-speaking Indian newspaper The Hindu, offering books. A large number of people responded, so Harriet Van Meter started sending books from her basement. In 1986, Harriet Van Meter was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts, and she was a finalist.Lexington Herald-Leader: Kentucky's brush with Nobelity In 2006, Kentucky Educational Television aired the documentary Harriet Van Meter: A Life Extraordinary. The International Book Project has sent over 7 million books worldwide since 1966. The organization celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2016. Mission By providing needed quality books to the people of the developing world, the International Book Project seeks: *To promote education and literacy in developing countries and in areas of need within the United States *To broaden Americans' understanding of their neighbors, and *To foster global friendships and strengthen world unity Shipping Methods IBP sends books in the following ways: *Small Shipment - 35-pound boxes of books, which can be sent to anyone in the developing world with a postal address *Pallet - A pallet typically contains 700 - 1,000 books. It is often sent to organizations that need more books than a small shipment can provide, but do not need or have funding for a sea container. *Sea Container - 20' or 40' containers that travel by sea, containing 10,000 - 40,000 books and can stock a University library or provide textbooks for an entire school district. =Volunteer Opportunities= IBP was started when volunteers started sending books from Mrs. Van Meter's basement, and IBP still needs help. IBP is a small organization, a staff of five, with just four full-time employees. Programs =Books Out= Books Out is a self-service program in which representatives from organizations abroad or in areas of need within the United States come to select books at the IBP warehouse and deliver them personally. =Books as Bridges= Books as Bridges is an international pen- pal program which partners Central Kentucky classrooms with classrooms in developing countries around the world. Through shared artwork and letters of participants, the program encourages students to develop higher reading levels, cultural awareness, and international friendships. By fostering international friendships, Books as Bridges hopes to spark a passion for social change among Central Kentucky youth. The classrooms in Central Kentucky receive cultural lessons about their partner classrooms. In the developing world, the classrooms receive a box of books as an impetus to continue in the program. Peace Corps IBP often sends books to Peace Corps Volunteers. In 1992, IBP was named \\"A Partner for Peace\\" by the US Peace Corps.

Topics The main content of BhƒÅruci's commentary deals with the duties of a king, particularly regarding whether or not the king can be a source of dharma. BhƒÅruci's view as discussed by Derrett was that the king did not have any legislative power, but he did have \\"the power to issue regulations and edicts of a temporary character or for the purpose of facilitating objects already inculcated by the dharma≈õƒÅstra.\\"Derrett, J. Duncan M., \\"BhƒÅruci on the Royal Regulative Power in India\\", Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 84, No. 4, (1964), 392. Kane agrees, stating that \\"the king is not the source of the rules of Dharma, but it is ≈õƒÅstra that defines the rules binding on the different varnas (classes) and ashramas (stages of man's life).\\"Kane, P.

The season includes 12 episodes and was shortened due to creator Seth MacFarlane's participation in the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which resulted in Fox airing episodes without MacFarlane doing the final work. The episode \\"Lois Kills Stewie\\" was the last episode completed before the strike. When the strike ended in February 2008, Fox had already aired three episodes without any input from MacFarlane. Episodes 2-8 of the sixth season are included on the Volume 6 DVD, which was released on October 21, 2008, and episodes 9-12 are included on the Volume 7 DVD, which was released on June 16, 2009. The season aired in the UK from May 4, 2008 - June 15, 2008 on BBC Three. The executive producers for the sixth production season are Seth MacFarlane, David A. Goodman, Chris Sheridan and Danny Smith. Despite this being the show's sixth television season, only four episodes from the sixth production season were aired as part of it, with the remainder being held off for seasons seven and eight as a result of the WGA strike. Goodman and Sheridan continued to serve as showrunners. Production In November 2007, Variety reported that creator Seth MacFarlane had joined the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike and refused to complete more Family Guy episodes. A spokesperson for Fox said: \\"Our hope is that he returns to work and completes his non-writing obligations on those episodes\\". IGN reported that Fox would air three episodes of Family Guy without MacFarlane doing the final work. MacFarlane noted that Fox could legally do that, but thought it was a \\"colossal dick move\\", and said that \\"They've never done anything like this before [...] It's really going to be unfortunate and damaging to our relationship if they do it.\\" Fox aired two new episodes during November 2007.

He died in Merton, Surrey and is buried at West Norwood Cemetery in London. On his death, Richard Thornton left an estate of ¬£2,800,000, which is the largest fortune to have been valued for probate in Great Britain before 1870. Richard Thornton was a merchant and trader, notably in Baltic goods. He was also a Liveryman of the Leathersellers' Company (a Livery Company of the City of London), of which he became Master in 1836. He personally funded the new almshouses built for the Leathersellers' Company at Barnet, where his bust (by Thomas Earle) is still preserved and a nearby road is named Thornton Road in his honour. The Leathersellers' Company also has a portrait of Thornton painted in 1838 by Frederick Yeates Hurlstone.Farrell, Jerome: Richard Thornton, Entrepreneur and Leatherseller in The Leathersellers' Review 2010‚Äì11, pp 16‚Äì18  Background  Richard Thornton was born in Burton-in- Lonsdale, North Yorkshire. He later funded a primary school and a church building in the village. He was educated at Christ's Hospital, Newgate Street, London from 1785 to 1791. He became a Donation Governor of Christ's Hospital in 1833. Christ's Hospital ‚Äì an English boarding school ‚Äì is now located at Horsham in Sussex.  Wealth and obscurity  Richard Thornton's wealth was remarkable. At his death in 1865, his estate of ¬£2.8m was one of the largest ever recorded. That figure equalled 0.35% of the net national income of the day, or ¬£3.9bn in 2007 terms, which makes him the 165th richest Briton since 1066. Yet, as the eminent historian W G Hoskins noted in his article for the magazine History Today, his name means nothing today, even though in his lifetime his wealth rivalled that of the Rothschilds and the Barings.  Profiting from the Baltic blockade  Richard Thornton made part of his fortune as an indirect result of Napoleon's fatal and failed invasion of Russia. During this campaign the French army was stationed at Danzig from where it guarded every Baltic port. The Danish were strong supporters of Napoleon and their hostility to English trade was considerable: captains of Danish ships were threatened with death should they engage in any form of commerce with England. This made valuable and essential Baltic trade difficult and dangerous for English merchant ships. In response Richard Thornton armed one of his own merchant ships, fought off a hostile Danish gunboat, and landed in the Baltic under an assumed German name. In the process he secured essential supplies of Baltic hemp for the Royal Navy at considerable profit to himself. Richard Thornton's lucrative Baltic trade continued and two years later, in 1812, his brother Laurence was in the port of Memel, now known as Klaipƒóda, when he heard of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. He got word back to Richard in London so speedily that it was three days before the news reached any one else in the city, including members of the British Government. Realizing this, Richard Thornton went quickly about the city obtaining signatures on contracts for the forward delivery of Baltic goods. Since the contract prices were inflated by the blockade which had now been removed, his already sizable profits became significantly greater. Richard Thornton's activities in the Baltic earned him the nickname ‚ÄúThe Duke of Danzig‚Äù.  First ever private steam yacht  On 12 June 1827, Richard Thornton sold the paddle steamer \\"Quentin Durward\\" to Kaptajnl√∏tnant Lauritz Christensen, Copenhagen, who renamed her ‚ÄúDania‚Äù. Since he first used her on pleasure tours on the Sound, this makes her the first ever private steam yacht. Petersen H M, \\"Danske dampskibe indtil 1870\\", Esbjerg, 1983, page 89.

It premiered on the Showtime Cable Network on December 14, 1984.http://www.perennialpictures.com/about/history/company/index.html The film features a cast of Mirthworms which are described as cuddly little critters about two inches long, who live in the tiny town of Wormingham.A Merry Mirthwom Christmas. 1984. VHS. FHE, 1986. Mirthworms tend to use proper nouns that play on the word \\"worm\\". The characters live in the town of Wormingham, the main character is named Burt Worm, and the antagonist is named Wormaline Wiggler. The show was followed by two additional Mirthworm specials, A Mirthworm Masquerade (1987) and Mirthworms on Stage (1989). A Merry Mirthworm Christmas Burt Worm has just moved into the town of Wormingham. Excited for the Christmas season he is invited by his neighbor, Crystal Crawler, to assist in decorating the Town Hall. Due to his clumsiness chaos is caused in the Town Hall, and holiday decorations are knocked over and broken, Burt is asked by chairworm Wormaline Wiggler to leave immediately, which he does. Burt proceeds to sing a song about how he is so lonely, and just wanted to make some friends. He writes a note, but just before he leaves, Crystal appears at his door telling him to come to the party. Burt refuses because what he did this morning and tells Crystal to head to the party without him. Crystal then leaves to the party to find out who asked Burt to not come, but after Crystal leaves, Burt leaves the house. At the party, Crystal tells everyone about how hard he tried to fit in, and tells that Christmas is for everyone and she says that Burt deserves another chance. The Mayor shows up shortly after, and is unhappy with Wormaline for asking Burt to leave, stating that Christmas is for everyone, the mayor threatens to remove Wormaline from her position as chairworm. The Mirthworms then rush to Burt's house only to realize that Burt has run away. Refusing to not give up, Wilbur Diggs starts up search parties to find Burt. The search proceeds, but the weather gets so bad that the Mirthworms have no choice but to return to Wormingham. Upon arrival at Town Hall many of the Mirthworms express how sad they are that Burt has left, stating that they really liked him. Crystal is incredibly sad, because she said that Burt is her friend and her friend was the best thing he could be. As the Mirthworms are moping about, Burt wakes up near the tree asking why they are so sad, they state that it is because they fear the worst for Burt (not realizing that it was he who asked them). When they realize that Burt is there, they are surprised and happy. Burt explains that it got so cold that he decided to come back to the Town Hall and fell asleep. Under pressure from the mayor Wormaline apologizes to Burt for asking him to leave. Despite her apology, The Mayor removes Wormaline from her chairworm position, and instead gives her a second chance for Burt to live here. Then Crystal announces how Burt can contribute to the Christmas celebration, he has an excellent singing voice. Burt proceeds to sing \\"Deck the Halls\\", and \\"I Wish You a Merry Christmas\\" (a modified version of \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\"). A Mirthworm Masquerade A Mirthworm Masquerade first aired on April 11, 1987. The Mirthworms of Wormingham are all excited about the annual Masquerade Ball, and Bert is planning to ask Crystal to be his date. But Wormaline Wiggler forces Bert to dress as Prince Pringle and accompany her to the ball when the real prince fails to show up, forcing Bert to break Crystal's heart. At the ball, Bert causes trouble, then leaves. The real Prince Pringle then arrives and puts on Bert's discarded mask, causing Wormaline to mistake him for Bert and treat him in her usual unpleasant matter. Meanwhile, Bert finds Crystal and hurries to get her to the ball. Upon arriving, Crystal is named Queen of the ball. Wormaline's anger at this changes to horror when Prince Pringle reveals himself, and she realizes just who she had been mistreating. Crystal kisses Bert on the cheek. Mirthworms on Stage The Mirthworms take center stage at the Wormingham Bowl as they present \\"Sleeping Beauty.\\" Wormaline Wiggler tries to wrangle the lead but Crystal Crawler wins the prize. Crystal is reluctant to do so, as she suffers from stage fright, but Bert convinces her. Wormaline attempts to steal the show, but her sneaky shenanigans bring down the house instead.

First published by Viking Press in 1989, it won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize that year. The novel is set in 1956, in Fetherhoughton, a dreary and isolated fictional town somewhere on the moors of northern England. The people of the town seem benighted, but are portrayed by Mantel with sympathy and affection. The plot centres on the Roman Catholic church and convent in the town and concerns the dramatic impact of the mysterious Fludd, who is apparently a curate sent by the bishop to assist Father Angwin, a priest who continues in his role despite privately having lost his faith. The novel presents an uncompromisingly harsh view of the Roman Catholic Church, portraying a vividly cruel mother superior and a thoughtless, bullying bishop. The narrative flirts with the supernatural (for instance, a wart migrates miraculously from one person to another, a character bursts into flames, Fludd causes food to vanish without appearing to eat it). Fludd resembles the Devil in various ways (he instantly succeeds in learning people's innermost feelings and wishes, and he performs subtle profane miracles like maintaining an ever-full whiskey bottle). Yet Fludd's effect on both of the two main protagonists, Father Angwin and the young Sister Philomena, turns out to be very liberating, and the novel ends with some degree of new hope for both of them.

History The exact age and origin of the tradition of making paper hearts is unknown, but the oldest known pleated Christmas hearts were made by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen in 1860. However, as Andersen's heart has no handle, it seems unlikely it could have been used as a Christmas tree ornament. That pleated heart is today located in the Hans Christian Andersen Museum in the city of Odense in Denmark. It is documented, however, that Andersen did make decorations for Christmas trees, and that the predecessors of the pleated Christmas hearts were made from wicker baskets. The oldest known guide to making pleated Christmas hearts is found in the Official Nordic handicraft Journal (1871),, and the oldest pleated Christmas heart (from 1873) is preserved at the National Museum of Denmark, in Copenhagen. But it was still some 40 years before the pleated Christmas hearts became more widespread.

Child's was deposed in 1929 as the head of the $37,000,000 Childs Restaurants chain. A 1930s undertaking, Childs' business eventually lost momentum during the Great Depression. It is significant because its founder was one of two brothers who began Childs Restaurants approximately four decades earlier. On April 29, 1930, he opened a restaurant at Broadway and 102nd Street. Old Algiers, the first establishment, was a dinery adaptation of an Algerian village. The new chain advertised itself as unstandardized in contrast to the standardized type of eateries begun by Childs and his brother, Samuel S. Childs, in the 1890s. William Childs planned additional units to be added at the rate of ten to twelve per year. Each was to have a theme patterned after an old world center, i.e. Old Normandy, Old Paris, France, and Old London, England. Located in the New York City metropolitan area, Childs' three nephews, Ellsworth, William, and Wallace, served as vice-president, secretary, and treasurer, respectively. The second restaurant, Old London, was in a former Chase National Bank branch inside Bush Tower at 130 West 42nd St., next to Times Square, where Childs leased the bottom two floors and basement in March 1931. The restaurant business had officially been christened with the corporate name Old London Inc., by this time. Architects Pruitt & Brown planned to extensively modify the space in \\"old London style\\" for an eatery with a seating capacity of 1,000 diners. The former bank counter would be utilized as a luncheonette service bar. Childs' venture did not result in a chain as he had hoped. He operated the Old Mill Inn, near his family farm in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, prior to his death on May 22, 1938. He died in Somerset County, New Jersey, Bernardsville, New Jersey.

Description The warty frogfish grows up to long. Like other members of its family, it has a globulous, extensible body, and its soft skin is covered with small dermal spinules. The skin is covered with numerous small, wart-like protuberances. Its large prognathous mouth allows it to consume prey its same size. The coloring of its body is extremely variable because it tends to match its living environment. Frogfishes have the capacity to change coloration and pigment pattern in a few weeks : during coral bleaching events, they can even turn to plain white to blend in with the environment. However, the dominant coloration goes from white to black, passing through a whole range of related nuances such as cream, pink, yellow, red, and brown, often with dark, circular spots and/or with saddles. Some heavily spotted specimens can easily be confused with its close relative Antennarius pictus. This characteristic can help to separate them: usually, A. maculatus has red or orange margins on all fins and sometimes a spike of the saddle blotch starts posterior to the eye. The first dorsal spine, the illicium is modified and is used as a fishing rod. Its extremity is endowed with a characteristic esca (lure), which looks like a small fish with a pinkish to brownish coloration. The illicium is twice the length of the second dorsal spine and its often darkly banded. The second dorsal spine is practically straight and is mobile, and the third one is bent towards the back of the body; both are membranously attached to the head. They are well separated from each other and also from the dorsal fin.Pietsch & Grobecker, ‚Äò‚ÄôFrogfishes of the world‚Äô‚Äô, Stanford University Press, 1987, The pectoral fins are angled and help, with the pelvic fins, to move the fish on the bottom and to keep a stable position for ambush. The warty frogfish exhibits biofluorescence, that is, when illuminated by blue or ultraviolet light, it re-emits it as red, and appears differently than under white light illumination. Biofluorescence may assist intraspecific communication and camouflage.

Habitat The warty frogfish is found in sheltered rocky and coral reefs; adults are usually associated with sponges down to deep. Feeding As all frogfishes, A. hispidus is a voracious carnivore which can attack all small animals that pass within its \\"strike range\\", mainly fishes. Its prey can vary in size to close to its own size. Behaviour Like other members of their family, they have a benthic and solitary lifestyle. They gather during mating period, but do not tolerate each other any more after the act of fertilization. The female can kill or eat the male if he stays close.

In 1939 he became a refugee from the Spanish Civil War and returned to France before moving on to Algeria after Germany's invasion. In Algiers, Tona was dedicated to the Resistance and participated in the organisation of the Allies' landings in 1942. Along with painter Louis Bernasconi he set up the \\"Salons de la R√©sistance\\" in North Africa to raise money for the movement. He also contributed to the newspaper Combat and the Allies' propaganda (with posters and flyers). It was at this time that Tona established strong friendships with Albert Camus, Ren√© Capitant, Max-Pol Fouchet, Ren√©-Jean Clot, Jean Brune and Jean Amrouche. Later life From 1944 to 1947 Tona exhibited his work in Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Paris. His exhibition in the \\"Champion-Cordier\\" gallery in Paris in 1946 was sponsored by Albert Marquet who also gave him lodgings in this studio in La Frette-Montigny. His work featured in various exhibitions and art shows in Algiers from 1948 to 1960. He received the \\"Prix de la critique\\" in 1950 and the \\"Prix du Salon de La France d'Outre-Mer\\" in 1952. During this time, the Art Museum of Algiers bought several of his paintings. In 1960 Tona returned to live in Paris where the supported himself with his paintings and sculptures. He organised many exhibitions of his work in France and abroad. Several of his paintings where acquired by the Art Museum of Toulouse in 1965 and the National Fund for Contemporary Art in 1980. He died in Paris on 12 February 1987.

It was one of the only two roads that connected Ladakh with the rest of India, the other being Leh-Manali Highway. The Srinagar-Leh Highway was declared as National Highway in 2006. The old Central Asian trade route Srinagar-Leh-Yarkand was also known as the Treaty Road, after a commercial treaty signed in 1870 between Maharaja Ranbir Singh and Thomas Douglas Forsyth.  New numbering  As of 2010 notification from Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, NH 1D has been renumbered as National Highway 1, along following route. Starting at Uri, Baramula, Srinagar, Kargil and terminating at Leh. The route from Uri to Srinagar was part of old NH1A before renumbering. Junction : near Kashmir Weather conditions Heavy snowfall on the highest passes can block traffic, cutting Leh from Srinagar for some six months each year. During springtime, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) plows snow and repairs damages caused by landslides. Zoji La pass received reportedly some of snowfall in 2008. Geography For most part, NH 1D transited through extremely treacherous terrain and followed the historic trade route along the Indus River, thus giving modern travelers a glimpse of villages which are historically and culturally important. Ladakh, the Road journey The road generally remained open for traffic from early June to mid-November. The total length of NH 1 was . Details of National Highways in India-Source-Govt. of India The two highest passes on NH 1D include Fotu La at elevation and Zoji La at elevation. Between Fotu La pass and Leh, a government checkpoint is stationed in the village of Khalatse. Dras, located some from Srinagar at elevation of , is the first major village over the Zoji La pass. The village is inhabited by a population of mixed Kashmiri and Dard origins, having a reputation of being the second coldest permanent inhabited spot in the world after Siberia, with temperatures dropping to . History In the 17th and 18th centuries, the road was only a track, impassable even with ponies. Goods, mainly pashmina wool, were carried by porters from Yarkand and Tibet for Kashmir shawl industry. In the 19th century, the route was improved, allowing pony caravans to pass. This work was started after Dogra General Zorawar Singh conquered Ladakh region from the Sikh Empire during 1836‚Äì1840 Trans-Himalayan campaign and princely state of Jammu and Kashmir was formed when the British sold Kashmir to maharaja Gulab Singh in 1846 Treaty of Amritsar. In April 1873, the Kashmir government allocated 2,500 rupees annually for upkeep of the Treaty Road and associated serais. During the 1950s, tensions rose in Ladakh region. China secretly built a military road spanning some from Xinjiang to western Tibet, which was discovered by Indian in 1957 and confirmed by Chinese maps showing the road in 1958. The political situation eroded, culminating in 1962 in the Sino-Indian War. The road on the Chinese side gave PLA an advantage as a reliable supply line, giving the Indian Army impetus to build a road for supply and mobilisation of their own troops. The building started from Sringar in 1962, reaching Kargil in two years. This was the basis of modern Srinagar-Leh Highway. Building the road was hazardous task, given the challenging geographical location, and maintaining the road is still an unenviable task. Restrictions on civilian traffic were lifted in 1974. This highway was used as mobilisation route by the Indian Army during Pakistani occupation of Kargil in 1999, known as Operation Vijay.

Reyniersz (or Reiniersz) was born in Amsterdam in 1604 (or perhaps 1602). He left for the Indies in 1627 as Upperbuyer (opperkoopman) on the Dutch Coromandel (Karnataka). He was promoted to Governor of the Coromandel Coast in 1635, even though he had been accused of engaging in (forbidden) private/personal trading. In 1636 he became Counsellor- extraordinary (Raad extra-ordinair) of the Dutch Council of the Indies. He returned to Amsterdam as Admiral of the returning fleet in 1638 and established himself as a merchant there. However, he lost his entire fortune, so left again, this time aboard the Salamander, for India on 24 April 1645. He arrived there on 3 December 1645. The following year, 1646, he became a full Counsellor of the Indies. His allocated task was to carry out a new policy in the Indies. Most importantly, he was, as far as possible to eliminate sources of competition. He was to take action against private trading and to deal with too much production of spices by having trees cut down. Reinier stuck strictly to this policy, which led to much conflict in West Ceram, where the population would not accept the destruction of their plantations. It took until 1658 for the area to be pacified. Four years after Reyniersz become a Counsellor, Governor-General Cornelis van der Lijn received an honorable discharge (sic) and on 26 April 1650, Reyniersz was named his successor, a task he very much looked forward to. Four years later he was dismissed. The governors of the company were not pleased by the weakness of his rule. There still exists in the Netherlands his letter of dismissal. It indicates he was being dismissed because he had been unable to carry out the duties of his office, particularly maintaining peace. The letter was never sent, because Reynier had already written to the Seventeen Lords (Heren XVII) asking to be relieved of his office on health grounds. This letter arrived just before his dismissal letter was to be sent. The Seventeen Lords willingly agreed to his request, though he died before their response reached him, on the night of 18/19 May 1653. He was buried in Batavia, Dutch East Indies and was succeed as Governor-General by Joan Maetsuycker.

It was developed by German studio keen games GmbH & Co. KG and published by Atari, Inc. (Atari, SA subsidiary) and released in North America on October 21, 2008, and in Europe on October 24. The game features several recipes, each listing preparation times, ingredients and courses. In addition, What's Cooking? can be used as a shopping list to remind players what items to purchase, and it can act as a timer to count down from a specified time and make an audible sound when it is done. The game was first revealed by Atari at the Games Convention 2008. The game was poorly received after its release; video game critics gave it an aggregated score of 49% at Metacritic. Reviewers generally agreed that presenting a cooking guide as a video game was a good idea, but they found that the game was poorly executed and mediocre as a result. Gameplay alt=Two screens, one above the other. Above, text instructions. Below, a virtual knife is cutting a lemon. What's Cooking? is an interactive cookbook and food preparation video game with recipes that each list preparation times, ingredients and courses. Recipes can be sorted by criteria such as dishes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, or vegetarian-only meals. After opening a recipe, an ingredient list is presented. Items on the list can be earmarked and added to a shopping list as a reminder to purchase in the future. A timer option is also available, which counts down from a specified time and makes an audible sound when it is done. Before doing any real cooking, a virtual representation of each step in the recipe is given on the screen that must be performed by the player. The Nintendo DS touchscreen and stylus are used to perform tasks such as whisking eggs, pouring sauces and cutting vegetables. Tutorials are also available to teach the player how to perform simple cooking preparation tasks. While cooking, the Nintendo DS responds to audible commands; saying \\"next\\" into the device's microphone will move the recipe on to the next step. One hundred recipes are included in the game, and players can create their own dishes in the game. Afterward, they can share them with others via Wi-Fi. In addition to the game's cooking aspects, What's Cooking? features challenges in which the player uses the stylus to chop, stir, and serve as quickly as possible. Development What's Cooking? was first revealed by Atari at the Games Convention 2008. The game is narrated by Jamie Oliver. In an interview with Official Nintendo Magazine, Oliver noted that he tries to make his games as \\"three dimensional as possible\\", and he wanted to \\"make it relevant\\" to the player. The developers also wanted to make the game as interactive as possible. Reception What's Cooking? was generally poorly received by video game critics, receiving a 49% aggregated score on Metacritic. IGN's Daemon Hatfield called disguising a cooking tutorial as a video game a \\"pretty brilliant idea\\", but only as long as it was done well. He stated that both the cookbook and food preparation halves of the game were not strong enough to make the game worth purchasing. Hatfield commented that the game's controls are \\"terribly unintuitive, and the cookbook doesn't offer anything its physical counterpart can't for cheaper\\". He was also disappointed that there were no pictures to illustrate each step, and not every cooking process is explained. Eurogamer's Ellie Gibson was satisfied with the number of recipes available, most of which were \\"pretty easy to follow\\". Gibson, however, preferred to see instructional videos to observe how a recipe was made before making it. In their review of the game, Official Nintendo Magazine commented that the stylus-controlled cooking tutorials are not user-friendly, and the recipe sharing is as good as it could be since players can only use ingredients and methods from recipes that they have unlocked through playing the game. They felt that the game attempts to appeal to gamers rather than aspiring chefs, concluding, \\"[The game has] some great recipes but the experience is marred by some fiddly cooking games.\\" See also *Cooking Guide: Can't Decide What to Eat? *Cooking Mama References External links * What's Cooking? with Jamie Oliver official site * What's Cooking? with Jamie Oliver at GameFAQs 2008 video games Atari games Cooking video games Video games developed in Germany Nintendo DS games Nintendo DS-only games Cookbooks Video games based on real people Cultural depictions of cooks Cultural depictions of British men ","title":"What's Cooking? with Jamie Oliver"},{"id":"20614088","text":"Urvaoba is a village in the municipality of Urva in the Qusar Rayon of Azerbaijan.

The war goddess (Nafanua) had prophesied that there would come a new religion which would end the rule of the old. Christian sailors had been visiting Samoa from the late 18th century, and had been teaching Christianity and some locals had converted.http://www.samoa.co.uk/music&culture.html; In 1830, the London Missionary Society arrived at Sapapalii.

In 1848, the first version of the New Testament was printed in the Samoan language, followed by a Samoan version of the Old Testament in 1855. Catholics and Protestants competed for converts amidst a backdrop of Imperial rivalries between Catholic France and Protestant Britain.

Biography Ben grew up in Cambridge, England where he picked up an interest in DJing and electronic music production as a teenager. Having spent two years working for British Youth For Christ where he toured the UK, he formed the house music group Aorta with DJ and friend Simon Dayman in 2002. =Aorta= Aorta was born when friends and DJs Ben Jack and Simon Dayman felt frustrated at the lack of diversity in Christian worship music. They set about to create a group which encouraged the church to think outside the box on matters of musical and non musical worship. The duo were joined in 2004 by producer Andy Searle Barnes, and quickly established themselves with appearances all over the UK, including the Greenbelt festival, Spring Harvest, and Soul Survivor (charity). In August 2005 the group released their debut EP Love Hope Future on Rubik Records to positive reviews. In 2008 the band announced they would be separating in July to concentrate on solo projects. =Going solo= As a solo artist Galactus Jack moved in a slightly different direction, embracing a broader EDM sound and a stronger focus on faith themes that would help listeners connect to the Christian gospel message. His debut single 'Headspace' gave fans their first taste of his solo material, showcasing a rockier edgier sound. The single was featured on the various artists album The Rose Sessions: Volume One (TVCM Music 2008). Galactus Jack has since produced five EP's and an Album (2016's UNIVERSAL), and has toured extensively around the UK, throughout Europe and into Asia and North America. =Reality Bytes (2009)= Reality Bytes was the Debut EP from Galactus Jack, released on 27 April 2009 worldwide through TVCM Music. The EP was written and produced with Chris Taylor at Liverpool's Rooftop Audio Studio's and features guest vocals from CCM artist Shell, MC Ad-Apt and singer/songwriter Lindsey and utilised live electric guitar parts and an electronic/rock hybrid sound. \\"Reality Bytes\\" received positive reviews from various online sites such as Cross Rhythms, Soul Audio and Louder Than The Music and won Independent Contemporary Album of the Year at the Christian Broadcast Council Awards 2010. =NEON (2012)= Neon was co-written and produced with Roo Walker over the first six months of 2012, and was released independently to a strong critical reception in July. The EP was predominantly an instrumental work drawing influences from French electronic artists such as Justice, Cassius and Daft Punk and moved Galactus Jack back to his house DJ roots. The title track was the sole featured vocal on the EP, an epic two part chill out track featuring Dawn Elektra. =UNIVERSAL (2016)= UNIVERSAL, the debut album, was released through the Message Trust, with who Galactus Jack has been working with full-time since 2014. Featuring collaborations with Lucy Speakman (Brightline), Crown Freedom (Vital Signs), Geek Boy, Lucy West (Vienna; Blush UK), and Jonathan Ogden (Rivers and Robots), UNIVERSAL embraced various styles within the EDM genre, from the commercial house sounds of Captured and Heaven, to the big room sound of Existence. Released on July 29, once again the critical response was overwhelmingly positive with Louder Than The Music heralding it as \\"modern, dance inspired, cool and fresh\\" and awarding it 5/5, and OneManInTheMiddle saying \\"this is a release that is bang up to date for the EDM crowd. If that‚Äôs your thing then my suggestion is get this album, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be disappointed\\" in their 8.9/10 review. =Younger Days (2017)= Younger Days was released as three EP's throughout 2017, with the full album to be all three EP's and new material collected onto one release in spring 2018. Part I was a four track EP and exclusive Geek Boy remix, released in March and included the single 'I Got You feat. Soulbox', which featured a music video shot on location in New York City. Part II was released on August 25 as a double A-Side single featuring the tracks 'Lay It Down feat. Philippa Hanna' and '100 feat. Dawn Elektra'. Part III is released on December 15 and brings the EP releases to a climax before the album arrives in the spring, and features three original songs including collaborations with Twelve24, Roberto Rosso, Ad-Apt and SoulBox, plus an exclusive remix of the Part II track '100' by drum and bass DJ/Producer BCee which received its debut play from Rene LaVice on BBC Radio 1's drum and bass show on 12/12/17. \\"The final part of the EP series has some of my favourite new songs on it from Younger Days, both musically and lyrically, as well as having my mate and all around legend Bcee bringing some drum and bass remix vibes to 100\\" said Galactus Jack.

Overview  Though the characters appeared together in the show's introduction, they each appeared separately in their own episodes. Each 30-minute episode of Baggy Pants and the Nitwits contained two segments: one for Baggy Pants and the other for the Nitwits. Baggy Pants is an anthropomorphic cat mimicking Charlie Chaplin's \\"Little Tramp\\" character, right down to Chaplin's signature toothbrush mustache and walking cane. Similar to Chaplin and the Pink Panther, Baggy Pants performed all of his misadventures in pantomime, without a spoken dialogue by any of the characters in his segments. The Nitwits is about an elderly superhero named Tyrone (voiced by Arte Johnson) who, by public demand, re-emerged from retirement to again fight crime, taking cases at his own discretion with help from his wife Gladys (Ruth Buzzi) and his anthropomorphic cane which he called \\"Elmo\\" which, among other things, helped Tyrone and Gladys to fly. Johnson and Buzzi adapted and reprised the roles they had originated in Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, with much of the adult innuendo (including Tyrone's original last name Horneigh) being removed to keep the cartoon family-friendly. In the opening titles of The Nitwits segment, Johnson himself was credited with having \\"created The Nitwits for television.\\" The series ran for 13 episodes; As of 2019, it has yet to be released on home video.

Struve was also the sole agent in Washington of the German Savings & Loan Society of San Francisco until 1896, at which time he was succeeded by his son Frederick Karl.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. IX, p. 248; Hunt and Kaylor, Vol. II, pp. 246-248. Mayor of Seattle In 1879, soon after moving to Seattle, Struve was appointed a regent of the Territorial University (forerunner of the University of Washington), and served, by reappointment, four terms, being president of the board during that tenure. Struve was elected mayor of Seattle in 1882 and was reelected in 1883. During his tenure the city enjoyed great prosperity and growth; many civic improvements were made, at a cost of more than $500,000, and Seattle's population doubled from 5,000 to 10,000. As mayor, he received the Villard party upon the completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad in September 1883. Upon leaving the office of mayor in 1884, Struve was elected school director, serving until 1887. Appointed judge advocate general by Governor Squire in January 1886, Struve took a prominent part in directing the militia when Seattle was placed under martial law following the anti-Chinese riots of February 1886 (during the mayoralty of Henry L. Yesler). Later life In 1887 Struve was appointed reporter of the Territorial Supreme Court. Under his supervision, the third volume of the Washington Territory Reports was compiled. Struve was greatly interested in historical research and investigated Washington's early history in his leisure hours, intending to publish the results in book form, but all of his data was lost in the great Seattle fire of June 6, 1889. However, he started on the work again at a later period. Struve was a member of the board of freeholders that framed a new city charter for Seattle in 1890. He soon had to decline many honors and confine his attention to his extensive private practice, acting as counsel for many railroads and lumbering and coal-mining companies. The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. IX, p. 248; Hunt and Kaylor, Vol. II, pp. 246-247. Henry G. Struve died during a visit to New York City on June 13, 1905. His death was very unexpected, his daughter Mary being the only member of the family with him at the time. Burial was in Lake View Cemetery in Seattle.

The name Nacotchtank, existing in several historical variants including Nacostine, Anacostine, Anaquashtank, Nacothtant, Nachatanke, and adapted into Latin as Anacostan. The name is derived from the word \\"anaquashatanik\\", meaning \\"a town of traders\\". The Nacotchtank seem to have been associated with the larger Piscataway, whose Tayac or grand chief ruled over a loose confederacy of area tribes. The Nacotchtank paid tribute to the Piscataway chief who resided to the south in the nearby village of Moyaone (present-day Accokeek). Rivals and reluctant subjects of the Tayac hoped that the English newcomers would alter the balance of power in the region. Another closely related tribe was the Doeg, whose homeland was on what is today the Virginia side of the Potomac. All of these groups are thought to have spoken the Piscataway (or similar) variant of the Nanticoke language. Villages Their principal village, named Nacotchtank, was situated within the modern borders of the District of Columbia, on the eastern bank of a small river that still bears an anglicised variant of their name -- the Anacostia. The village of Nacotchtank was the largest of the three native villages in the area and was located between the now Anacostia Park and the Bolling Air Force Base, in the floodplain below the easternmost part of Fort Circle Parks. Here the Nacotchtank chief was noted as residing in a 1624 map by Captain John Smith. The chief was known as a werence, werowance, or weroance depending on variations in English spelling. Another village was located on Capitol Hill, with farms found on the sites of the Supreme Court and Library of Congress growing corn, beans, and squash. Evidence of this village has been found in Garfield Park, and it may have been supported by a spring in the area that is today bounded by 1st Street SE, 2nd Street SE, B Street SE, and C Street SE. Some indications are that this may have been less a village, and more just an agricultural area. Another village, called Tohoga, was at the site of modern Georgetown, with a hair comb, hammer stone, and pendants found near the Whitehurst Freeway in 1997. Arrowhead points and pottery have also been found on the White House grounds. The Nacotchtank lived in wigwams and longhouses, as was typical of other tribes along the East Coast. The villages were not generally compact assemblages of buildings, but rather dispersed settlements of scattered dwellings generally following a watercourse other than occasional small clusters of buildings. The areas in between buildings were generally used for cultivation. Sharp-edged tools came from a quarry in the Piney Branch area, and bowls and pipes were mined from a soapstone quarry near what is now Van Ness. Encounters with the English The Nacotchtank were first recorded by Captain John Smith, who visited their palisaded village in 1608 and found them friendly. He noted that their main village had 80 fighting men, with a total population of about 300. It was an important trading center; tribes as distant as the Iroquois of New York would come to trade beaver pelts. The Nacotchtank traded beaver skins to the Piscataway, Susquehannocks and arriving English. These early records also noted that the Nacotchtank possessed \\"good stores of corn\\". In March 1622, Captain Henry Fleet, age 20, took a party of approximately two dozen Englishmen from Jamestown, in an attempt to barter for corn from the Nacotchtank. The Nacotchtank were suspicious of the settlers, and a confrontation erupted into fighting. All of the settlers were killed except for Captain Fleet, who was captured. Held captive for 5 years, Fleet learned the language and culture, including noting that the Nacotchtank enjoyed a monopoly among area tribes on fur trade with the Iroquois and also noting the village Tohoga in present-day Georgetown. In November 1622, a rival Patawomeck chief offered to help the settlers get the corn from his \\"mortal enemies\\" ‚Äî the Nacotchtank and the Piscataway at Moyaone ‚Äî as well as avenge the deaths of the English settlers. After a \\"stubborn fight\\" at Nacotchtank, the English killed 18 and drove the rest from their cabins before plundering and burning the village.American Anthropological Association, 1889, as indicated by https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2018/11/22/native-american-tribe-once- called-dc-home-its-had-no-living-members-centuries/ Captain Fleet remained a captive of the Nacotchtank, but would escape in 1628. In 1632, Captain Fleet returned to Nacotchtank and obtained \\"800 weight\\" of pelts. http://onceasitwasdc.org/media/Why%20Did%20the%20Anacostan%20Indians%20Choose%20to%20Live%20on%20Capitol%20Hill%20Feb%202018.pdfaccessdate=2020-10-13 The Jesuits arrived into Maryland in 1634, and Father Andrew White studied the local language to adapt church teachings for the natives. As of 1634, Jesuits noted that Captain Fleet was still in Nacotchtank as a trader. Father White introduced the Latinised name \\"Anacostine\\" and \\"Anacostan\\" for the Nacotchtank people. Around 1668, greatly depopulated from Eurasian infectious diseases endemic brought by the English, to which they had no immunity, the Nacotchtank relocated to Anacostine Island (present-day Theodore Roosevelt Island), giving the island the first name known to be associated with it. No living members of the tribe remain. Remnants and descendants likely merged with local tribes such as the Piscataway.

He is best known for his role in the band Antimatter, as well as being co-vocalist on the Number 1 single 'Broken Smile' (The Beautified Project).  Musical history  Moss began writing music for a solo career in 1995 after numerous disappointments with previous bands, the idea being that no longer could a key member pull out leaving the current project in ruins. From 96‚Äì98 the solo project went through numerous name changes, from ‚ÄòThe Reptile Brain‚Äô, to ‚ÄòHeavy Soul‚Äô and eventually ‚ÄòCloud One‚Äô. The style of music early on was instrumental with a strong leaning towards rhythmic psychedelic rock/trance. The addition of vocals to Moss‚Äôs abilities in 1996 led to a shift in musical direction, where the writing turned to dark, melodic acoustic rock. During this period he wrote and recorded key tracks ‚ÄòOver Your Shoulder‚Äô, ‚ÄòSaviour‚Äô, ‚ÄòToo Late‚Äô and ‚ÄòAngel‚Äô (later re-titled to ‚ÄòAngelic‚Äô). Antimatter was formed in 1998 when Duncan Patterson (then of Anathema) approached Moss to record an album with him after hearing Moss's demos which bore a striking resemblance to his own newer material on Anathema's 'Alternative 4' album (neither party had heard the others latest material). The project was titled 'Antimatter' by Patterson, and would record their debut album in 2000. The album 'Saviour', featured an even split of songs written separately by Patterson and Moss. This method of writing alone and then compiling completed songs into one album would continue for the course of Patterson's involvement in the project. Patterson decided he‚Äôd had enough of Antimatter after the release of the third album ‚ÄòPlanetary Confinement‚Äô. Due to the non-collaborative nature of the previous albums, Moss (with Patterson‚Äôs blessing) continued with the projects name, writing and releasing the entirety of the fourth album, ‚ÄòLeaving Eden‚Äô, and continuing to tour performing Antimatter songs of his own composition. In 2008, Mick established his own record label ‚ÄòMusic In Stone‚Äô, releasing Antimatter's Live@An Club. From 2009 ‚Äì 2010 Moss compiled the 3CD/DVD, 100 page artbook 'Alternative Matter', producing the 30 minute documentary 'The Small Yesterdays'.

Goo's efforts to protect their rights from anti-Chinese prejudices meant that many Chinese were able to prosper in their work and living.Gerber, James and Guang, Lei: Agriculture and Rural Connections in the Pacific, 1500‚Äì1900, page 192. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2006. Goo Kim Fui met the young Sun Yat-sen when Sun was studying in Hawaii. They both shared the same Christian faith and were friends with the same pastor, Sit Moon. As Chinese Vice-Consul to Hawaii, Goo was able to help Sun obtain travel visas to Honolulu. Later, Goo and other members of his church financially supported Sun in his efforts to overthrow the Qing dynasty in 1911. Goo Kim Fui fully supported Sun Yat-sen's revolution toward a modern China and shared similar ideals. As the social work of Goo Kim Fui occupied so much of his focus, appears that these innovative programs and social engineering innovations influenced the thinking of the young Sun Yat Sen.  Early life  Goo Kim Fui was born in 1835 in Mei Xian of the Guangdong province of China to a Hakka family. In his early 20s, he went to Southeast Asia to pursue new business opportunities, but in 1866, he decided to go to Hawaii to establish himself there and expand his businesses. Goo knew the English language well and was very successful in networking with the local tradesmen. In a few years, he became one of the wealthiest and prosperous merchants in Honolulu.The Overland Monthly, page 474. Samuel Carson, 1898  Religious beliefs  Chinese Christian Church, Honolulu, HI In 1875, through Sit Moon, a Chinese pastor from San Francisco, Goo converted to Christianity. At the time, they attended the church service of Rev. Samuel C. Damon's Seamen's Bethel Church. In 1877, they established the Chinese Y.M.C.A. which would later become known as the Chinese Christian Association (CCA). It was chartered by King Kalakaua on November 13, 1877 and many Chinese attended the fellowship meetings. The congregation gradually grew in number and funds were raised to construct a new church building to accommodate the people. In 1879, the Chinese Christian Church, which would later become the First Chinese Church of Christ in Hawaii, opened its doors.How Firm the Foundation: A Short History of the First Chinese Church of Christ.

Goo later succeeded his predecessor as the presidentThe Overland Monthly, page 471-473. Samuel Carson, 1898 of the United Chinese Society in July, 1892. The anti-Chinese agitation in the 1880s and increasing anti-Chinese activities led Goo to organize the Mutual Defense Association (\\"Lein Wei Hui\\") in 1894 and in response to help his own countrymen when they were refused medical help at the general hospital, he set up a Chinese hospital in March 1897 () to cater to Chinese patients. With the help of his long-time Christian friend, Sanford B. Dole, President of the Republic of Hawaii, Goo won the legal battle to protect the rights of the Chinese migrants living and working in Hawaii as well as the right to legally attain American citizenship. Following a disastrous fire on January 20, 1900 that burned down nearly all of Chinatown, Goo Kim Fui actively participated in efforts to save Chinatown and eliminate the large losses suffered by local Chinese businesses. He donated his own money to help the victims of the fire. News of this was reported back to the Qing government in China and he was honored with an award for his contribution. In July 1902 Goo Kim Fui was promoted from Vice Consul to Acting Consul General of the Chinese Legation in Honolulu following a US Department of State protest. Yang Wei-pin, the previous Chinese Consul in Hawaii resigned \\"for domestic reasons\\" and was immediately replaced by Goo Kim Fui.United States Dept. of State: Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, page 249.

Early life and studies Chaim Gliksberg was born in Pinsk, then Russia, to Rabbi Shimon Yaakov Gliksberg and Cypa Mejta, daughter of Rabbi Mordechai Dovid Alpert. When he was 2 years old his family moved to Odessa. He attended cheder and the Odessa yeshiva. In 1918 he attended the Bershadsky School of Art in Odessa. From 1920 to 1924 he studied in the city‚Äôs Art Academy under Professor Dvornikov and academician Costandi, names well known in the Russian arts‚Äô world. Life and work in Israel Arriving in Eretz Israel in 1925 he went straight to Jerusalem. He worked in Bezalel and later in road paving. Despite living hardships he painted a great deal. In 1927 his first exhibit went on display at the Lemel School under the auspices of the Hebrew Artists Association in Eretz Israel. In 1929 the artist moved to Tel-Aviv where he taught and maintained a studio. In 1930 he held a one-man show in Ohel Shem, which Hayyim Nahman Bialik opened with an enthusiastic speech. Gliksberg was not only a wonderful portraitist and an excellent artist who delved deep into the souls of his subjects, but also a gifted writer and connoisseur of music. Distinguished authors and artists such as Hayyim Nahman Bialik, Alter Druyanov and Gershon Shofman were fond of him and held him in great esteem.Ha'avar, a publication devoted to the history of Russian Jewry It seems that there was no other painter for whom Bialik sat so often. The seven portraits of Bialik painted by Gliksberg which feature the poet in summer clothes and winter clothes, with his walking stick, pouch and wide-rimmed hat are among the best portraits of Israel's national poet. Chaim Gliksberg's record of conversations he engaged in with Bialik during the sittings were assembled in a book called Bialik Day to Day and are some of the truest and most authentic among Bialik's documented oral exchanges; devoid of any attempts at falsity, distortion or artificial embellishment, they present Bialik as he truly was.Chaim Gliksberg Bialik Yom-Yom, Hotsaat Ha-Kibuts Ha-Meuhad, 1948 Tel Aviv When a dream of a full-scale municipal museum in Tel-Aviv began to take shape Gliksberg was invited to serve on the Museum Committee representing painters and sculptors. In 1934 Gliksberg was among the founders of the Painters and Sculptors Association. Awards and legacy He was awarded the Dizengoff Prize in 1936, 1937 and 1956. His paintings can be found in museums, public and private collections throughout the world. After his death a street in Tel-Aviv was named after him.

History Whittier north Whittier south The Whittier was constructed as an apartment hotel, meaning that tenants could rent an apartment, yet have access to services typically provided by a hotel.The Whittier Hotel/Whittier Apartments from Detroit1701.org The Whittier was built at a time when the population boom in Detroit increased demand for housing. The developer selected a site near the Detroit River, in an area that was, until then, primarily used for exclusive upper-class homes. Construction began in 1921, and ran until 1927.Rick Steele, \\"The Whittier Hotel - A Legend Reborn,\\" Tuesday, 26 August 2008, from CitiesOfPromise.com Over the years, the luxury hotel played host to luminaries such as Horace Dodge, Eleanor Roosevelt, Mae West, Frank Sinatra and The Beatles. During Prohibition, the hotel's convenient access to the Detroit River and Canada made it popular with underworld types, including the Purple Gang. The hotel changed hands many times, and was occupied until 2000 or 2001, when the last residents moved out. In June 2003, the building was purchased by Phoenix Communities, who refurbished the eight-story section into a senior citizen's living center, known as the Whittier Manor. Renovation of the fifteen-story tower has recently come to a deadlock. Description Charles N. Agree designed the Whittier Hotel; it was the first of several large luxury hotels designed by the architect. Due to the soft, marshy ground, Agree used a slab foundation to support the hotel. The complex actually consists of two separate structures: an eight-story building to the north, and a larger fifteen-story Italian Renaissance style tower to the south. The eight-story northern building is constructed from red brick and has regularly spaced windows.Whittier Hotel from the state of Michigan The first and second stories are faced with smooth stone, and feature a classical arcade. This building originally contained 184 units, and was completed in 1922. The fifteen-story southern building was completed in 1926. It is basically Italian Renaissance in style, and is built from buff brick with terra cotta trim in the upper floors. A modern entrance of a single story in height has been recently removed.

At New College, Oxford, he \\"enjoyed a riotous year\\", according to an obituary in The Daily Telegraph, before dropping out. A different picture of his personality was given by an obituary in the Liverpool Daily Post, which described him during his schoolboy period as \\"a shy and solitary figure, and this mood continued into New College, Oxford\\".\\"William Buchan\\", obituary, Liverpool Daily Post, 7 July 2008 Visiting the set of Alfred Hitchcock's film version of The Thirty-Nine Steps, a novel written by his father, the young man became interested in the movie industry, and Buchan senior got him a job working with Hitchcock at Gaumont-British Motion Picture Corporation. His salary as third assistant director was a token five shillings a week, so he lived off an allowance from his parents and lodged in London with the writer Elizabeth Bowen. It was becoming clear to him that he was being edged out of his job at Gaumont-British when a throat ailment resulted in an operation, causing him to leave sooner. To recuperate, he went to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, where his father was serving as governor general. On the order of the Canadian prime minister, Mackenzie King, the young Buchan was barred, along with his brother Alastair, from a nightclub outside Ottawa. King disapproved of Buchan's parents, in particular regarding his father as a \\"libertine\\". He then moved to New York in 1937, where his father provided him with literary connections. At one point he asked the critic Alexander Woollcott for a job but was told, \\"When I was a boy you were supposed to go to the bottom of the nearest tree and climb steadily until you got to the top.\\" At the suggestion of French film director and actor Michel Saint-Denis, Buchan visited Peggy Ashcroft, who had acted in The 39 Steps, and the pair began a two-year affair. Buchan then returned to England at the age of 21, but soon spent three months in Florence, Italy, and on his return met Kenneth de Courcy, publisher of Intelligence Digest and carried dispatches from de Courcy to France. On one occasion Buchan visited Otto von Habsburg, claimant to the throne of Austria, who questioned him closely about British politics. In 1939 Buchan married Nesta Crozier, and in December 1940 the couple had a daughter, Perdita Buchan. He also co-founded The Pilot Press, which published his short (at 10,000 words) but admiring book on Winston Churchill (a stance at odds with that of his father), and later his brief history of the Royal Air Force. He learned of the death of his father in 1940 from a news hoarding. War service He enlisted in the Royal Air Force in February 1940 and joined No. 32 Squadron, flying Hawker Hurricanes on patrols in the Western Approaches. He was transferred to Egypt, then to No. 261 Squadron in Iraq. He flew over Palestine and served in the defence of Cyprus. He initially served in the ranks, and was a leading aircraftman prior to being commissioned as a pilot officer on probation on 20 January 1941 (with seniority from 14 January), the commission was confirmed, and he was promoted to war substantive flying officer, precisely a year later. After the Japanese invasion of Singapore, 261 Squadron was sent to reinforce the air force on Java. By the time it arrived at Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), on the carrier Indomitable, the pilots were ordered to fly to RAF Station China Bay on that island. On Easter Day, 5 April 1942, the squadron saw intense action against Japanese bombers from five aircraft carriers mounting a major attack against Colombo. When the Japanese force withdrew four days later, the carrier Hermes and two cruisers had been sunk, and only six of 261 Squadron's original 18 aircraft were serviceable. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 20 January 1943. Buchan twice had to bale out of his aircraft and came close to death on other occasions. At one point a cannon shell struck behind his cockpit seat; on another, a shell hit his ammunition reserve but didn't go off. After serving with air defence for Ceylon and Madras, he was transferred to air headquarters in Calcutta for six months, then returned to join No. 17 Squadron in Ceylon. He was back in England in April 1945 to serve at RAF Training Command, where he compiled a history, The Royal Air Force at War, an account of the daily lives of servicemen, and was promoted to squadron leader before ending his service. This was published by his Pilot Press, as mentioned above. Later life and career His marriage broke up during the war, and in 1946 he divorced his first wife and married Barbara Ensor, with whom he had three sons and three further daughters, including the writer James Buchan and Ursula Buchan, gardening columnist for The Daily Telegraph. That marriage ended in divorce in 1960. After the war, Buchan worked in Glasgow for the explosives division of Nobel Industries, then became London editor of Reader's Digest. He spent three years with the magazine and claimed that he came up with the story \\"How My Dog Taught Me to Pray\\". Buchan founded a public relations company, which went out of business by the late 1960s, then did work for Norwest Holst, a large construction company, and later for Elf Aquitaine, the French national oil company. Simultaneously, Buchan pursued his literary career. A short story collection, The Exclusives, was published in 1943. He next published Personal Poems in 1952 and Kumari in 1955, a novel set in Calcutta. Two thrillers, Helen All Alone (1961) and The Blue Pavilion (1969), followed. He also edited the correspondence of John Masefield and the violinist Audrey Napier-Smith, Letters to Reyna, which appeared in 1982. He was best known for his John Buchan: a Memoir, also published in 1982, and his autobiography, Rags of Time, which appeared in 1990. On the death of his brother, Johnnie, in 1996, William Buchan succeeded to the title, taking his seat in the House of Lords. There he spoke once, on the case for an elected mayor of London. In 1960, the year his second marriage was dissolved, Buchan married a third time, to Saur√© Tatchell, with whom he had a son. According to Buchan's obituary in The Daily Telegraph, in addition to the eight children of his three marriages \\"there was also another daughter.\\" Buchan's eldest son, Toby (born in 1950), succeeded to the peerage. Reception of his writings The memoir of his father (1982) was regarded as his best book, but his autobiography, The Rage of Time (1990), had its admirers, according to an obituary in the Liverpool Daily Post. His book of poems, published in 1952, was praised in the Times Literary Supplement, which described his voice as \\"winning and sincere\\". The reviewer wrote, \\"In writing to please himself, he will please others too, for his unselfconcious sympathies are easy to share, his young man's experience corresponds with that of half his generation, his turn for verbal music is quietly refreshing, and everywhere competent.\\" Kumari, published in 1955, has been described as \\"a lush, complex novel about the experiences and romances of a young man in 1930s India\\". One reviewer wrote that the book tells the reader as much about India and British rule there \\"as a hundred official publications, or, it might be added, a dozen travel books\\". Buchan wrote his first thriller, Helen All Alone, deliberately in the vein of his father's novels, but with a woman as the main character, a point which provoked criticism in The Times. The reviewer declared, \\"Women in a thriller should be decorative, not pivotal.\\" The TLS, in contrast, praised the book's description of atmosphere and scenery.

The short was released on June 24, 1950, and stars Sylvester, Tweety and an unnamed bulldog, who would later become known as Hector the Bulldog. The title is an adaptation of the familiar train conductor's call, \\"All aboard!\\" The instrumental theme used to underscore the motion of the train is \\"On the 5:15\\".  Synopsis  In the opening scene, a train pulls into the station in a town called Gower Gulch, where Tweety's owner says goodbye to him and entrusts him to the care of a conductor in the baggage car. Tweety then notices Sylvester in the cage. Sylvester then opens the small door of his carrier and extends his paw to tap on the door of Tweety's cage. Tweety answers, and as Sylvester tries to grab him, the vigilant conductor swats his paw with a cane. The conductor hangs Tweety's cage on a hook in the ceiling to keep him safe and sound and warns Sylvester to behave. As soon as the conductor leaves the car, Sylvester proceeds to stack various articles of baggage to reach Tweety's cage. When Sylvester tries to grab Tweety again, Tweety finds the emergency cord, and pulls it, which causes the train to screech to an instant halt and sends poor Sylvester sailing through the air across several passenger cars, until he lands in the engine's furnace with the tender behind it. Sylvester quickly leaps out the firebox and runs back to the baggage car, and as he angrily stalks Tweety, Tweety pulls the cord again, and restarts the train, but sends Sylvester through the air into a garbage can lid that Tweety hides. Sylvester starts chasing Tweety, but is stopped by the conductor, who interrupts the chase and orders Sylvester back into his cage. In the next scene, Sylvester is in his cage next to a bulldog, who starts growling at him. Annoyed, Sylvester shouts \\"Aaaaaaah, shut up!\\" and whacks the bulldog with an umbrella, but is still with Hector growling at him, and yells \\"Aaaaaaah, shut your big yap, or I'll let you have another\\". At that moment, the train is approaching an incline and as it ascends, Sylvester slides into the bulldog, who punches him and sends him into the wall. When Sylvester slides back down, the train continues to climb, and sends the bulldog punching the poor cat again. In one occasion, Sylvester mutters \\"Mother,\\". As Sylvester starts sliding down yet again, the train starts moving down the incline, sending Sylvester sliding back to the wall and making him think he is safe, until he sees the bulldog sliding down toward him with fist extended to punch him again, which allows Tweety to say, \\"Poor puddytat!\\" Sylvester makes another attempt at stacking the baggage to reach Tweety. Tweety reaches for the emergency cord again, only to see that it has been cut and that Sylvester is holding it. Tweety pulls it anyway, and again sends Sylvester flying through the air, until he nearly lands in the engine's furnace again. Sylvester comes back and snatches Tweety, but when he hears the conductor's footsteps, he stuffs Tweety into a mailbag and leaves it on a hook alongside the track. Sylvester smiles sheepishly as the conductor walks by, then dashes to the observation car to grab the mailbag. He reaches inside and instead of Tweety finds the bulldog, who immediately chases him away. As Tweety is swinging inside his cage, Sylvester saws a hole in the roof and again finds the bulldog, instead of Tweety, who starts pursuing Sylvester atop the train. Sylvester momentarily eludes the bulldog by ducking into a space between two passenger cars, then both start running in the opposite direction. As Sylvester prepares to knock the bulldog out with a club, the train heads into a tunnel, slamming Sylvester in the face into the bridge above it (This attempt was later used again in Half Fare Hare with Bugs, Ralph and Ed.) The train finally returns to Gower Gulch station, where Sylvester, disguised as Tweety's \\"mommy\\", gets out of a taxi and rushes to the baggage car to claim him. The conductor hands him the cage, which is covered, and Sylvester hurries back to the taxi with the cage. As the taxi drives away, Sylvester uncovers the cage, it was revealed that the bulldog is inside the cage instead of Tweety! The taxi pauses at a mile marker post, and the bulldog rips it out and pummels Sylvester with it as the taxi speeds along the road. As Tweety (everyone forgot it) is observing this from the observation car, he sadly says, \\"Uh-oh, da puddytat's dot anudda pwaymate! It's donna be awfwy wonesome fwom here to Pasadena.\\" References External links * 1950 animated films 1950s American animated films American films Animated comedy films English-language films Short films directed by Friz Freleng Films set on trains Looney Tunes shorts Warner Bros.

The fictional element is in the same vein as Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. The title refers to the Rozabal shrine in Srinagar in Kashmir, which some (such as Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement, in 1899) have asserted is the tomb of Jesus of Nazareth. The historical basis is derived from several other books on the subject including Jesus Lived in India by Holger KerstenKersten, Holger. Jesus Lived in India. London: Element, 1986. and The Unknown Life of Jesus by Nicolas Notovich. Plot summary A cardboard box is found on a shelf in a London library. When the mystified librarian opens it, she screams before she falls unconscious to the floor. Within the labyrinthine recesses of the Vatican, a beautiful assassin of Asian origin swears she will eliminate all who do not believe in her twisted credo. An elite army of thirteen calling itself the Lashkar-e-Talatashar has scattered around the globe. The fate of its members curiously resembles that of Christ and his Apostles. Their agenda is Armageddon. A Hindu astrologer spots an approaching conjunction of the stars and nods to himself in grim realization of the end of the world. In Tibet, a group of Buddhist monks searches for reincarnation, much in the way their ancestors searched Judea for the Son of God. In strife-torn Kashmir, a tomb called Rozabal holds the key to a riddle that arises in Jerusalem and gets answered at Vaishno Devi. An American priest,Father Vincent Sinclair has disturbing visions of people familiar to him, except that they seem to exist in other ages. Induced into past-life regressions, he moves to India to piece together the violent images. Shadowing his every move is the Crux Decussata Permuta, a clandestine secret society which would rather wipe out creation than allow an ancient secret from being disclosed.  Author/Editions  Ashwin Sanghi The Rozabal Line is a thriller spanning between continents and centuries, with Ashwin Sanghi, under the pseudonym Shawn Haigins, tells a story that goes back to the time of the birth of Abrahamic religions. It was originally published in 2007, and a revised edition was published by Westland Ltd. & Tranquebar Press in 2008 under the author's own name, after some commentators such as Humra Quraishi said that the book should have been published under Sanghi's real name.Kashmir Times, \\"Signs of the Times\\" by Humra QuraishiAshwin Sanghi.

It also spoke of the Lashkar spinning off an ultra-elite group of twelve commandos, similar to the Deccan Mujahideen. The plot of The Rozabal Line used a ship off the coast of Gujarat as well as a Thuraya satellite phone besides describing the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower as the residence of one of the main characters in the story. Sanghi also described the group as being controlled by the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan without the knowledge of the Pakistani president.

A son of the well-respected Romford businessman William Poel, he also ran many businesses and contributed greatly to his local community. Family and personal life John was born in Romford on 14 April 1881, the son of William Poel (d.1924) and Caroline Poel n√©e McDermott (1847‚Äì1924). The Poel family lived in North Street, Romford for many years in what was locally known as Poel's Yard (John was born there). By the age of 19, John had become a foreman in the Yard, as his father let out some of the outbuildings to tradesmen such as bootmakers. On 12 September 1907 he married Miriam Gertrude May Bacon (2 January 1882 ‚Äì 28 April 1974), the daughter of Richard Bacon (1849‚Äì1913), the landlord of the Wheatsheaf public house in Hornchurch and his first wife Mary Ann Cowell (1850‚Äì1882).

Buehler. Description =Architecture= Much of the Maynard Buehler House is steel frame with redwood panel cladding; other portions are concrete block. Like many Usonian homes, the house has a distinct flat roof line, carports, underfloor heating, and is organized on a modular grid system on an L-shaped plan. The carport is cantilevered to the extreme engineering capacity. A prop was put at the corner during construction to prevent sagging. The roof was built two inches too high at that corner and when the prop was removed the roof settled right down to the proper level. This was a trademark of Wright: to take engineering to the extreme. The long leg of the L houses a wing with three bedrooms, and a small workshop. At the hinge, a small kitchen with wood cabinets and a dark countertop served the family. The more public spaces ‚Äì a living room, den, and dining room ‚Äì are arranged at an oblique angle to the main wing. The octagonal living room opens onto a dramatic space, with a shed roof soaring over it. The sloped ceiling has a large rectangular gold leaf inset that reflects the natural light. The hallway leading to the bedrooms is of redwood batten, as are the walls in the bathroom. The kitchen, with its wood cabinets and dark counter top, is conveniently nestled near the center of the house. The smaller wing was designed to accommodate Mr. Buehler's need for a home office and machine shop for his firearm accessories business. He was known for machining the highest-quality mounts, bases, and rings for rifle scopes. =Furnishings= Wright designed a number of pieces of furniture for the house. They include a dining room set with the backs of the chairs that do not intentionally rise above the tabletop so as not to impede the view of the garden. The wooden dining table consists of triangular pieces that can be moved around and more pieces added to create a large setting for Thanksgiving and other holiday feasts. The living room has a built-in bench along the perimeter. Manuel Sandoval, who made the cabinetry and furniture for the V. C. Morris Gift Shop, also crafted the Buehler pieces. =Setting= The building is on of land transversed by a small stream. The house is surrounded with Japanese style gardens designed by Henry Matsutani. There is an expansive lawn area that sprawls away from the main living area and a ceremonial Japanese Tea House or chashitsu at the farthest reach of the property. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 2006.

Listed at 6' 0\\", 180 lb., Upham batted and threw left-handed. He was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. In his first major league season, Upham appeared in 5 games as a relief pitcher, and 3 as a pinch hitter. He was notably more successful as a pinch hitter (2-for-3) than as a pitcher (33.75 ERA). All his 3 batting appearances were as a pinch hitter in games where he did not appear as a pitcher, and he did not play a fielding position in those three games. Although Upham opened the season with the Cubs, he was sent down to the minor leagues in May and did not return to the majors that year. Over a year later, in August 1968, Upham returned to the big leagues for 13 additional games with the Cubs. This time Upham was primarily used as a pinch hitter and pinch runner, but was also used as an outfielder and as a pitcher‚Äîhe appeared in two games as pitcher, and in two games as an outfielder. For one of those outfielding appearances, Upham was a late-inning defensive replacement in left; for the other, he got the start in center field on August 18 and played the entire game at that position. This made Upham the majors' last \\"two-way player\\" (i.e., a player used regularly in non-blowout/non-extra-inning games as a both a pitcher and a fielder in the same season) for 35 years. Brooks Kieschnick was the majors next two-way player, for Milwaukee in 2003. In a two-season career, Upham was a .308 hitter (4-for-13), scoring one run in 21 games.
