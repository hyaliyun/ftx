It was the eleventh cartoon in the series to be directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder in Czechoslovakia. This marks the final appearance of Tom's bald owner, as he would never be reused in anymore entrees. Further to that extant, the thin lady replaces him in the next short Buddies Thicker Than Water. Plot The film opens at the airport in Nairobi, where a big game hunter, Tom's grumpy owner, is preparing to go on a hunt through the African jungle. Tom, who was packed in a suitcase, has woken up from the long trip and is ready for the hunt, but is annoyed to find that Jerry had stowed away in the hunter's luggage. Tom and his owner are then off into the jungle riding on an elephant from Nertz. Jerry tries to climb aboard, but Tom points a shotgun at him, and in the process, he falls off and the gun's blast rockets him into a tree. Tom gets his nose stuck in the gun's barrel, but as he tries to get it out, he's at risk of getting shot because the trigger is caught on a branch. Tom's owner notices him and yells \\"THAT'S MY GUN! GIVE IT TO ME!!\\". He manages to get his nose out, and the bullets end up destroying his owner's hat, enraging him further. The elephant hands Tom over to the angry owner, who punishes him by wrapping a shotgun over his head and firing it, deafening him. Tom manages to clear his ears out and is able to hear the sounds of the jungle. Soon after, Jerry pokes his head out of a gun's barrel and taunts Tom. Tom tries to grab Jerry, but his irate owner immediately yells at him \\"DON'T TOUCH MY GUNS!!!\\", not wanting a repeat of earlier and losing any more of his weapons because of Tom's antics, which scares Tom off of the basket and onto the elephant's buckle. To make matters worse, Jerry unbuckles the belt, causing Tom to fall off. Later, the owner manages to fall off as well with the basket and his weapons. Tom's owner, blaming Tom for the act, angrily traps him in the overturned basket and the elephant walks off without them. The two attempt to get back on the elephant, but fail, and just as the owner prepares to punch Tom, they are both interrupted by the thunderous roar of a lion. Frightened, the owner reaches back for Tom to hand him a gun for self defense as Tom searches the basket. Jerry hands him with a thermos and he gives it to his owner. As Tom's owner fights the lion, Jerry puts his hat over his chest in mourning sarcastically, sobbing. After defeating the lion, the scratched-up and irritated owner takes a sip of coffee from the thermos and counts all the way to ten before clobbering Tom over his head with the thermos, blaming him for handing him the wrong item to fight off the lion. Tom's owner continues forward into the jungle, with Tom being forced to carry the basket, when the two spot their elephant resting in front of them. The hunter kicks the basket onto the elephant's back, buckles it back in place (Tom gets out from under the basket) and resumes the hunt. Tom once again finds Jerry, who hides in the lunchbox. Tom tries to find Jerry in the owner's lunchbox, throwing away the packed food in the process. Tom's owner turns red in the face upon discovering this as he slams the lid on the cat's paws, grinning sadistically with his redness fading away while Tom winces in pain with his flattened paw fingers. Later, Tom manages to get Jerry in his clutches and hides from his brutish master. The hunter finds him, but was interrupted as he threatens him when they spot a purple rhinoceros in front of them and it charges at them. As the hunter prepares to shoot his gun, Tom hides Jerry in the elephant's trunk, and the elephant sees Jerry in his trunk, scaring it and causing it to run off. All three of them try to run from the rhino, who pokes them with his horn and launches them into the air and they land on a tree branch, which snaps (at a good timing) and causes them to fall on top of the rhino. Later, the rhino, Tom's owner, and Tom are tied onto a long stick, carried by the elephant on the front end and Jerry on the back. The cartoon closes with a close-up on Jerry, who waves goodbye to the camera.

Structure It is in three sections as described below: # The Problem of Reproduction # The Historical Exposition of the Problem ## Round I: Sismondi--Malthus vs. Say --Ricardo, MacCulloch ## Round II: The Controversy between Rodbertus and von Kirchmann ## Round III: Struve-Bulgakov-Tugan Baranovski vs. Vorontsov- Kikolayon # The Historical Conditions of Accumulation Synopsis In the polemic, she argued that capitalism needs to constantly expand into noncapitalist areas in order to access new supply sources, markets for surplus value, and reservoirs of labor. According to Luxemburg, Marx had made an error in Capital in that the proletariat could not afford to buy the commodities they produced, and therefore by his own criteria it was impossible for capitalists to make a profit in a closed-capitalist system since the demand for commodities would be too low, and therefore much of the value of commodities could not be transformed into money. Therefore, according to Luxemburg, capitalists sought to realize profits through offloading surplus commodities onto non-capitalist economies, hence the phenomenon of imperialism as capitalist states sought to dominate weaker economies. This however lead to the destruction of non-capitalist economies as they were increasingly absorbed into the capitalist system. With the destruction of non-capitalist economies however, there would be no more markets to offload surplus commodities onto, and capitalism would break down. Reception The Accumulation of Capital was harshly criticized by both Marxist and non-Marxist economists, on the grounds that her logic was circular in proclaiming the impossibility of realizing profits in a close-capitalist system, and that her \\"underconsumptionist\\" theory was too crude. Her conclusion that the limits of the capitalist system drive it to imperialism and war led Luxemburg to a lifetime of campaigning against militarism and colonialism. It was however praised by prominent Marxist theorist Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs, who saw her work as a natural continuation of Marxist theory truly in the spirit of Marx, and also condemned those who criticize it, calling them bourgeois and revisionist.

A school of the Uniting Church, it operated for five years from 1985 until closure in 1989. History The school was established in 1985 in portable buildings on a north facing hillside. Initially, there were approximately 65 founding students covering years 5, 6 and 7 but over the course of five years, the school expanded to accommodate new students, staff, year levels and buildings. The founding principal was Brian Keyte and vice principal Peter Haines. They remained in their respective positions until the school's closure. Due to over expenditure and the strain of the late 1980s recession, the school was closed down at the end of 1989. At the time of the closure, at least 62 staff members and 444 students were engaged at the school.\\"Kingswood College Doncaster 1985-1989\\", page 60. 1989. Subsequently, the grounds became the Doncaster campus of Box Hill Institute of TAFE although this occupation was also short lived. Following the closure of the TAFE, the campus was vacant for some time before being razed in 2007 to make way for redevelopment.  Setting  The school benefited from a natural setting. Along, the northern and eastern boundaries, the Mullum-Mullum Creek meandered through a tree lined valley and in the basin of the valley, the school oval was formed. On the adjacent hillside, buildings were constructed. The south eastern corner near Deep Creek Drive remained mostly indigenous bushland. During 1987, Landscape plans were devised for the front entrance and for the areas around the buildings.\\"School Diary 1987 - The Year Book of Kingswood College Doncaster\\", page 5. 1987  Academia  From an inter-school perspective, Kingswood students competed in the Westpac Maths Competition, the Science Talent Search and the Alliance Francaise Competition.\\"School Diary 1987 - The Year Book of Kingswood College Doncaster\\", page 35. 1987 Within the school, \\"colors\\" were awarded for excellence in four areas (academic, creative, practical and personal) and an award (known as the \\"Wyvern Award\\") was given to a student at the end of the year for all-round excellence.  Sports  Early on, four sports teams or houses were established in which students were divided. The houses were named after local orchardists (such as Tully and Petty), thus reflecting some of the area's early history. Sports facilities, however, remained limited and this necessitated some trips between Doncaster and the sister campus at Box Hill. In 1987, Kingswood College Doncaster was admitted to the Eastern Independent Schools of Melbourne (EISM) and began competing with other schools in sports competitions. Jump Start In later years, a student rock band was formed consisting of Rachel Drew (vocals), Mark Hardley (vocals), Nick Maurer (guitar), Todd Shattock (keyboards) and Dan Morrison (drums). After finishing high school, Morrison went on to form the bands Mad Not Madness and Area-7.  Alumni  The defunct status of the school presents inherit problems for keen alumni. In the absence of any official reunion, an internet group utilizing the social utility facebook was established in 2007 in an effort to reconnect former staff and students. As of August 2010, the group has attracted 114 members.

The Triple Crown Son of the jumping trainer Jack Jones, young Herbert was apprenticed to Richard Marsh at the age of ten and rode his first winner in 1896. In 1900, he won the British Triple Crown when he rode Diamond Jubilee to victory in the 2,000 Guineas Stakes, Epsom Derby and St. Leger Stakes. He was the work rider for the temperamental Diamond Jubilee and it was noted that this wayward colt went better for him than for any more established jockey. Diamond Jubilee had rolled on his race rider Mornington Cannon after a gallop just before the 2,000 Guineas. Hence the young Jones got his chance and won the Triple Crown on the Prince of Wales's horse. Jones, Herbert (1881‚Äì1951). The National Horse racing museum Later career Jones in 1910.

The victory for the \\"royal\\" colt provoked \\"the wildest scenes of enthusiasm ever known in England\\", including a mass rendition of the National Anthem as the King led his horse to the winner's enclosure. In 1913, Jones rode another of the King's horses, Anmer, in the Derby. He was involved in a collision with Emily Davison, the suffragette, who was fatally injured.

The operating company was Soci√©t√© Luxembourgeoise de Centrales Nucl√©aires, a daughter company of RWE. It was the only nuclear power plant in the Rhineland- Palatinate after it was finished in 1986, however, due to problems with the building permit it only operated for 3 years and was taken offline in 1988. Subsequent attempts to bring the plant online continued until 1998 when the supreme court ruled for it to never be restarted. History The plant was built from 1975 to 1986 and potential problems were apparent before construction was completed. There were complaints from municipalities and delays from various suppliers. It was revealed that the construction site lay in an earthquake prone basin, the Neuwieder Becken. Due to earthquake concerns, the location was moved 70 meters from where it had been originally planned. After just three years of operation it had to be taken out of operation indefinitely, with restart pending a judicial decision. New requirements for a building permit were drafted and the licensing process essentially had to start over completely in order for the plant to come back online. The government of Rhineland Palatinate granted the plant a building permit, but it was rescinded by the higher administrative court in Koblenz in 1991 and 1995. The decision was confirmed by the federal administrative court in Berlin in 1998 in the final legal battle. The plant began the decommissioning process in 2001 and management was transferred from RWE. The removal of the fuel happened one year later. The removal of the plant and the cooling tower itself were postponed multiple times; both were still standing in 2018. Demolition of the cooling tower happened on August 9, 2019 at 15.38 local time.https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/rheinland-pfalz/koblenz/Muelheim- Kaerlich-Ein-Koloss-in-die-Knie,kuehlturm-muelheim-kaerlich- abriss-100.htmlhttps://www.dw.com/en/germany-demolishes-cooling-tower-of- former-nuclear-power-plant/a-49967279 Technical data * Owner: Soci√©t√© Luxembourgeoise de Centrales Nucl√©aires (RWE subsidiary) * Operator: RWE Power AG * Building firm: ABB * Type: Pressurized water reactor * Rated output: 1,308 MWe * First current production: 14.

He has also served Canada in international hockey, managing the 1996 and 1997 world championship teams and assisting in the 1998 Canadian Olympic squad. =Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and Ottawa Senators= From 1993 to 1995, he was the Assistant general manager for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. He left this position in 1995 to become the third general manager of the Ottawa Senators, signing a five-year contract. His time with Ottawa coincided with a turnaround in the team's fortunes. After the 1997‚Äì98 season he left his contract early, citing family issues, saying he would take time off to explore life away from hockey. Seventeen days later he was re-hired by the Ducks where he served as president and general manager. He was fired in 2002 after Anaheim missed the playoffs for three consecutive seasons. =Montreal Canadiens= On July 21, 2003, Gauthier joined the Montreal Canadiens as Director of Professional Scouting. On July 24, 2006, he was named Assistant to the General Manager while keeping the responsibilities attached to professional scouting. On February 8, 2010, he was named vice president and general manager of the Montreal Canadiens. Gauthier had a very controversial year as the Canadiens general manager in 2011‚Äì12. Gauthier fired the team coach Jacques Martin mid-season with the team slumping. Martin's replacement, Randy Cunneyworth, was chosen by Gauthier as the interim coach. Cunneyworth did not speak French, and this decision was heavily scrutinized by the Montreal media. There was outrage and protest among some Canadiens fans. Gauthier also incited the wrath of fans by trading 2010 playoff hero Michael Cammalleri to the Calgary Flames during a game against the Boston Bruins. Cammalleri had been critical of the organization in the days leading up to the trade,http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=611212 and the move was perceived by many to be a response to those comments. When he learned of the trade, Cammalleri asked if he could keep the jersey from his final game as a souvenir. Gauthier told him he could have it for the price of $1,250. On March 29, 2012, the Montreal Canadiens announced Gauthier had been relieved of his duties as general manager of the team. He then joined the Chicago Blackhawks, as Director of Player Personnel and had his name engraved on the Stanley Cup in 2013 & later in 2015. So as to right Gauthier's wrong, the new management gifted Cammalleri with the jersey from his final game as a souvenir.

Blume achieved his greatest career success at the collegiate level as a guard for an Oregon State University Beavers men's basketball. During Blume's four-year tenure the team went 86-27 and made the NCAA tournament twice. Blume won All-American honors in 1980 and was All-Conference in 1980 and 1981. He was inducted into the Oregon State Athletic Hall of Fame in 2004 and into the Pac-12 Conference Basketball Hall of Honor in 2017. Blume spent the 1981-82 season as a reserve for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association before playing the sport professionally in Europe. Biography =Early years= Bernard Ray Blume, commonly known by his middle name, was born September 23, 1958 in Valdosta, Georgia.\\"Ray Blume,\\" www.basketball-reference.com/ He attended Parkrose High School in Portland, Oregon, for whom he played basketball.Jesse Sowa, \\"Blume Inducted into Hall of Honor,\\" Corvallis Gazette-Times, March 11, 2017, pg. B3. =Collegiate career= Blume was recruited to Oregon State University by future Naismith Hall of Fame coach Ralph Miller. He was part of a 7 freshman recruiting class which joined 6 sophomores in making the 1977-78 OSU team the youngest in school history.K.J. White, Miller's Time: A Legacy of OSU Basketball, 1971-1989. Portland, OR: Highland Times Press, 1987; pg. 46. Joining the 6'4\\" Blume on the 1977-78 OSU team was Rose City backcourt rival Mark Radford, at 6'3\\" another tall guard who would later spend time in the NBA. While Blume came off the bench during his freshman year, from the 1978-79 through the 1980-81 seasons, Blume and Radford would comprise a potent backcourt combination for OSU, helping take the team to the NCAA tournament during the pair's junior and senior seasons. The Beavers finished Blume's freshman campaign with a record of 16 wins and 11 losses, with the curly- haired freshman coming off the bench to see action in all but two games. Blume's place was an important one, averaging nearly 16 minutes of game time over the course of the year, during which he scored an average of 6.2 points and garnered better than a steal per game. The season was the first of four in succession for Blume during which he made at least 50% of his shots taken from the floor, finishing the year with a field goal percentage of .521. OSU showed some improvement during Blume's second year ‚Äî a season in which he cracked the starting lineup for the opener.White, Miller's Time, pg. 52. Blume's path to the starting five was paved by the decision of previous starter Brian Hilliard not to return to OSU to play his junior season owing to a nagging injury and loss of focus. Blume took the keys to the car and never looked back, finishing the season shooting .500 en route to a scoring average of 13.4 points per game, with his backcourt mate Radford putting up very comparable numbers.\\"Mark Radford,\\" www.basketball-reference.com/ Together with 6'11 center Steve Johnson, another future NBA talent, OSU was tapped for post-season play in the National Invitational Tournament (NIT), bowing out in the first round. The 1979-80 season was a breakout year for Oregon State men's basketball ‚Äî with the team winning the Pac-10 title with an overall record of 26-4, topping out at #2 in the national polls, and gaining a regional 2-seed in the 48-team NCAA postseason tournament.White, Miller's Time, pg. 56. The season also proved to be a break-out year for Ray Blume personally. During this first of two extremely successful seasons, Blume logged more than 1100 minutes of action, upping his scoring average to 15.4 points per game as well as his shooting percentage, which finally rested at .564. Blume added averages of 2.2 steals per game and 4.5 assists to his r√©sum√©, garnering national attention with 2nd team All-American honors. Ray Blume's senior campaign, 1980‚Äì81, is the legendary year of Ralph Miller's \\"Orange Express\\" ‚Äî a season in which the team reeled off 26 consecutive victories, again winning the Pac-10 title with a record of 17-1, and sitting #1 in the polls for nearly 2 months.White, Miller's Time, pg. 63. To the senior starting core of Blume, Radford, and Johnson were added two more future NBA players, small forward JC-transfer Lester Conner and highly touted Oregon-born freshman power forward Charlie Sitton. Blume again combined shooting chops with defensive prowess, finishing the year with double-digit scoring on a much deeper team and upping his shooting percentage to a career high .569. He also managed to steal the ball 50 times for the third straight year and averaged 3.6 assists in Ralph Miller's old school \\"no bounce passes,\\" backdoor-cutting offense. The dream season came to a bitter close, however, with the team dropping its home finale to Alton Lister, Fat Lever, and the potent Arizona State Sun Devils before a shocking first-round exit in the 1981 NCAA Division-I basketball tournament. A stellar defender as well as a dangerous perimeter shooter in the years before the 3 point basket, Blume amassed 205 steals in his 111 games as a Beaver, an average of better than 1.8 steals per contest. He finished his OSU career with a scoring average of 11.6 points per game. Blume was selected for the OSU Athletics Hall of Fame in 2004 and named to the Pac-12 Basketball Hall of Honor in 2017. =Professional career= Blume was selected by the Indiana Pacers in the 2nd round (36th pick overall) of the 1981 NBA Draft and traded immediately to the Chicago Bulls along with a future 2nd round pick in exchange for Mike Oliver. Blume played for the Bulls during the 1981-82 season, appearing in 49 games, starting twice. During his brief stint in the association, Blume scored 4.6 points per game during an average of just over 11 minutes of action. Blume was sold by the Bulls to the NBA's San Diego Clippers on October 8, 1982 but he never saw regular season game action with the team. Blume was waived by the club on October 28, 1982.\\"Ray Blume,\\" Real GM, www.realgm.com/ After his short NBA career was over, Blume played basketball professionally in Europe. =Life after basketball= Following his professional basketball career, Blume returned to Portland, Oregon and began a lengthy career in the public sector working for the Multnomah County Roads Department.

Scientific jury selection is used during the jury selection phase of the trial, during which lawyers have the opportunity to question jurors. It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges‚Äîthe right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason‚Äîduring jury selection. The practice is currently confined to the American legal system. Scientific jury selection is based on the work of Fred L. Strodtbeck, the research director on the American Juries Project headed by Harry Kalvin, Jr and Hans Zeisel. He considered juries to be small groups and taped mock juries in Chicago and St. Louis and actual juries in Wichita, Kansas with the permission of the attorneys and judge but not the jurors. The study revealed that the characteristics of individual jurors influenced jury deliberations. SJS has roots in criminal trials during the Vietnam War era, but in modern times is usually employed in high-stakes civil litigation (where only money is usually at issue, in contrast to criminal trials, where the defendant can go to prison). SJS practitioners determine what background characteristics and attitudes predict favorable results, and then coordinate with attorneys in choosing the jury. Studies are mixed as to the effectiveness of the practice, though it is clear that the evidence presented at trial is the most important determiner of verdicts (the trial result) and that SJS is more likely to have an impact where that evidence is ambiguous. SJS's potential to unfairly skew the jury has led to some reform proposals, but none have yet been implemented. The limited fictional portrayals of SJS have been negative towards the practice. History and use Former Attorney General Ramsey Clark rated jurors and led the discussion among defendants, attorneys, and social scientists about jury selection in the Harrisburg Seven case. During jury selection in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option is a challenge for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or a conflict of interest), the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have a limited number of peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases. Attorneys have long used peremptory challenges to exclude \\"undesirable\\" prospective jurors, but have not always been successful at identifying these. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During that trial, social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges. The O. J. Simpson murder trial was marked by efforts to choose a friendly jury. A jury consultant helped pick the jury in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Criminologist Jo-Ellan Dimitrius used surveys to determine the ideal defense juror demographic (black women) and analyzed and judged the prospective jurors' answers to a questionnaire and response and body language during voir dire (the stage of jury selection where lawyers are permitted to directly question the jury). Prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi gives more credit to the traditional change of venue. He argues that transferring the case to a section of Los Angeles with more blacks in the jury pool was most detrimental to the selection of a prosecution-friendly jury. The prosecutor dismissed her court-appointed jury consultant early in the process. Contemporary jury consultants are often sociologists, people with experience in communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists who specialize in legal psychology.* Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation),. particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs‚Äô attorneys have invested large sums of money in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury and trial consulting firms have emerged, earning multi-million dollar revenues, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it.* Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written extensively about juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system. Methods The theory behind SJS is that juror attitudes predict voting preferences most effectively. By discovering what relationships exist between certain attitudes, attorneys can exclude those from the jury whose attitudes would predispose them to an unfavorable verdict. Researcher Shari Diamond indicates that jury consultants primarily rely on two methods: telephone surveys and mock trials (trial simulations). Telephone surveys are the practitioners' \\"primary research method\\". During a survey of the community where the trial is taking place, jury consultants ask about: # background characteristics of the jury pool such as race, sex, marital status, age, income, and job; and perhaps more specific questions that depend upon the case itself; # beliefs and attitudes likely associated with a favorable or unfavorable verdict; and # (after reading a summary of the facts of the case) which verdict the survey respondent would favor. An attorney asking questions during jury selection. Diamond writes that jury consultants then compare the three data sets to determine which background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with favorably biased or credulous jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool. An alternative is to test respondents at the researcher's facility with opening statements or a full-blown mock trial instead of reading a case summary over the telephone. The higher cost of a mock trial allows for a more realistic portrayal of the real trial and (researchers hope) more accurate data. It also provides a better opportunity to question the subjects, before and after the trial simulation. On the other hand, telephone surveys provide a larger and more representative sample of the jury pool. Diamond indicates that since both methods have advantages, SJS practitioners commonly rely on both in the same case. Besides the occasional astrologer or psychic, a few practitioners use unorthodox methods, such as in-courtroom assessment of posture, pupil dilation, or breathing to judge jurors both during selection and during trial. Though such methods have the veneer of science, psychologists reject them as nonsense and \\"science fiction\\".* Notwithstanding this, Jo-Ellan Dimitrius (from the Simpson trial) indicates that she also relies on appearance, body language, conduct, and even smells such as perfume or medication. She sometimes decides based upon her \\"gut feeling\\" about a juror.; the Kressels are repeatedly quoting from Research psychologists Kassin and Wrightsman indicate that the model employed (demographic factors predict attitudes that predict verdicts) has empirical weaknesses. That attitudes predict verdicts is taken for granted and rarely studied. For example, veterans might favor current troops, but that does not necessarily translate into a likelihood to acquit their brethren of crimes. However, the relationship between demographics and verdicts can be more reliably predicted by mock trials.. Successful prediction of jury verdicts often requires data specific to the case and jurisdiction. The sheer number of ways that one case can be unique outstrips the published research on the subject, so original research is often required. That necessity is exacerbated by the fact that many modern consultants are reluctant to share knowledge, even with other firms, because of paranoia, client confidentiality, and their regard for their work as \\"trade secrets\\".. One important variation is \\"group dynamics analysis\\". Some jury selection is concerned with the attitudes and bias of individuals. Some trial consultants also try to predict how individuals will form themselves into groups in the jury and which jurors will become leaders and followers in those groups. Consultants also use this tool after jury selection is over.. Efficacy Although advocates and practitioners of scientific jury selection claim the practice is overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The results indicated that the juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries‚Äô knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof. Another simplified experiment indicated that lawyers trained in a systematic selection method made better predictions of juror verdicts in two of four cases ‚Äì the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive relationships were weak or nonexistent. Some academic researchers argue that the actual efficacy of SJS is obscured by poor research methodology. Specifically, demographic characteristics used to predict juror attitudes and juror verdicts may not hold true across all types of cases. For example, men convict more frequently than women in some types of criminal trials but less frequently in others. Citing . Besides this, demographic characteristics are often less predictive than the attitudes jurors hold; for example, attitudes towards rape are better verdict-predictors than gender in rape trials.. The actual efficacy of jury consultants may not be very important because the demographic composition of the jury has little effect on the verdict it renders, usually causing only a 5%‚Äì15% variance in verdicts. The evidence presented at trial has far more impact on what the verdict will be.. As Kressel and Kressel indicate, \\"when the evidence is strong, nothing else matters much\\" and even when the evidence is ambiguous, demographic characteristics of jurors are a relatively minor influence.. Some researchers argue that a significant improvement in jury selection, however small, may be worthwhile when the stakes are high, as with a defendant accused of a capital crime or a corporation that stands to lose millions of dollars in a civil suit. A popular \\"proof is in the pudding\\" argument is often made, especially by consultants themselves; the argument goes that since attorneys and clients pay such high fees (sometimes as much as $500,000) for consultants, their services must be effective.. Others argue that most attorneys are unaware of the social science research on the topic.. The effectiveness of scientific jury selection has also been comparison tested against other methods, such as attorney folklore and intuition. For trial attorneys, justifying the expense of SJS is contingent upon an improvement over their own jury selection abilities. Several empirical studies of traditional jury selection (by attorneys acting alone) have indicated that it and SJS are about equally effective. Suggested reforms In light of the criticisms leveled against scientific jury selection‚Äîthat it lets lawyers stack juries and increases the influence of money‚Äîseveral reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on their race or sex.Batson v. Kentucky (1986) is the seminal case in this area, finding race-based use of peremptory challenges by prosecutors unconstitutional. Georgia v. McCollum (1992) extended the same prohibition to defense attorneys. The relevant precedents in civil law are Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company (1991) (regarding race) and J.E.B. v. Alabama (1994) (regarding gender). Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly in the context of a limited voir dire.. Other proposals include:. *lower the number of peremptories to force attorneys to use them only on the most clearly biased jurors and severely curtail their ability to \\"shape\\" the jury with peremptory challenges. *ban jury consulting through legislative action, though it may be impossible to fairly draw a line that excludes SJS but doesn't exclude advice from other attorneys in the same firm, for example. *limit useful information by severely curtailing verbal questioning and written questionnaires of prospective jurors. This may have the perverse effect of encouraging many erroneous Batson challenges based solely on race or gender instead of more sophisticated metrics of bias. *prohibit investigation of the jury pool or release the list of prospective jurors on the eve of jury selection to make investigation of prospective jurors impossible. *force disclosure of consultant use by making surveys of prospective jurors or the community discoverable by (legally accessible to) the opposing party. If consultants' research is discoverable, each party could use and benefit from their research. Despite serious discussion among lawyers, scholars, legislators, and others about various reform proposals, none have been implemented and no consensus exists about which remedy, if any, would be the most appropriate and effective.See, for example, . In fiction The major fictional representations to date have largely portrayed jury consultants as villains that are highly effective at influencing the jury, often using illegal tactics that mainstream practitioners do not use. Consultants are major characters in John Grisham's novel The Runaway Jury and the similar film adaptation. In the film, Rankin Fitch, \\"jury consultant for the defense\\", leads a team that uses high technology and sometimes-illegal tactics to prevent a judgment against their corporate client in what Salon calls \\"our worst nightmare of corporate arm-twisting\\". Writing about the book, Kressel and Kressel say Grisham \\"plays on fears that the American justice system has been hijacked by crafty attorneys and immensely effective hired-gun social scientists\\".. Jean Hanff Korelitz's A Jury of Her Peers stretches the known reality of consulting much further. Korelitz's fictional consultants are part of an unscrupulous firm that charges prosecutors to kidnap homeless people, program them with drugs into conviction-only jurors, and substitute them for those hoping to avoid jury duty. Jonakait says the novel is \\"hardly realistic\\" but \\"reveals the distrust engendered by jury consultants\\".. In a fifth-season episode of the CBS television series Numb3rs, entitled \\"Guilt Trip\\", an illegal arms dealer (James Marsters) is tried for racketeering and the murder of the key witness against him. After he is unexpectedly acquitted, the investigation reveals that he had hired a sleazy jury consultant to not only identify those jurors who would most likely sway the rest of the jury's deliberations, so as to bribe and extort them into pushing for acquittal, but also train one of his henchmen to pose as the perfect \\"prosecutor's juror\\" and get placed on the jury. In season one, episode eleven, of the television series Leverage, a pharmaceutical company is under fire for a wrongful death case involving a stimulative all-natural herbal supplement. In an attempt to prevent major losses for the pharmaceutical company in question, and to protect the investment of a soon-to-be-parent company's subsidiary, scientific jury selection is used. However, the Leverage team thwarts their efforts every step of the way, similar to a giant chess match. In the CBS television show Bull, the lead character operates a trial analysis company, which specializes in utilizing psychological profiles built by observing jurors during voir dire and online profiles to both select the jury and try arguments against mirror jurors. The show is based on the early career of Dr. Phil McGraw.

In it, the band performs the song live on a low- budget cable show while a young viewer (portrayed by Frank Howley) uses a special remote to alter the reality of the performance on his TV.

She was born on May 27, 1962 in S√∂derala, a small place in mid-Sweden and grew up in Gothenburg and Stockholm. Between 1967 and 1969, she lived with her family in British Columbia, Canada, a period which made a very deep impression on her and later in life influenced her writing. She died on 24 March 2005 of an unintentional prescription drug overdose, aged 42. Mare Kandre achieved considerable acclaim in Scandinavia and her works have been translated into more than eight languages. Her novels, short stories and prose poetry often deals with children's, in particular girls', development to adulthood; women's roles; and marginalized and traumatized individuals who opt to break with society's expectations. Mare Kandre's stories have a marked metaphysical dimension which is strengthened by her poetical language and representation, with existential themes paired with contemporary social issues. In her writing she often returns to issues like the expectations placed on women, how alienation develops, and the significance of instincts. Several of her books were influenced by Gothic fiction. Before Mare Kandre entered onto the path of writing, she was the frontwoman for the music group Global Infantilists (1981-1983).

Conducting yarns are used to manufacture carpets and other items that dissipate static electricity, Electrically conductive yarn, a patent description such as work clothes in highly flammable environments, e.g., in the petrochemistry industry. There are several methods known to manufacture electrically conductive textiles. The simplest way is to incorporate metal wires or wire meshes into fabrics. Another approach is to use metalized yarns. In staple yarns, it is possible to spin short strands of regular yarns with metal yarns. Electrically conducting yarns may be made of a central metal strand with regular yarn woven around it. It is however also possible to coat a base polymer (such as Polyamide 6 or Polyester) with metal like silver. Yarns of that sort are for example \\"Shieldex\\" or \\"SwicoSilver\\" whereas it is only possible with the latter to coat non-Polyamides as well. Furthermore, it is possible to coat filament yarns with other metals than silver with the underlying coating technology of SwicoSilver yarns: Gold coated polyester yarns are for example no impossibility anymore. An altogether different approach involves yarns based on conductive polymers, such as polyaniline.Polyaniline-coated PET conductive yarns: Study of electrical, mechanical, and electro-mechanical properties, Journal of Applied Polymer Science (2006) Volume 101, Issue 3 , Pages 1252 - 1256 Electrically conductive yarns can also be produced from carbon nanotubes (CNT). Individual CNT-based fibers are spun (wet spinning) into a fiber directly from a solution. The solution either contains pre-made dissolved CNTs or the combination of chemicals required to synthesis CNTs. Tens to hundreds of individual fibers can be woven into a yarn. CNT-based yarns find applications in energy and electrochemical water treatment and can replace copper windings, e.g. in motors, which would improve the efficiency and consequently reduce the use of energy.

Early life Slingsby Bethel was the third son of Sir Walter Bethel of Alne, North Yorkshire, who married Mary, the second daughter of Sir Henry Slingsby of Scriven, near Knaresborough, and was baptised at Alne 27 February 1617. Being a younger son, he was placed in business, and went to Hamburg in 1637, staying there until December 1649. Civil war period He was strongly opposed to the cause of the cavaliers, but did not approve of the conduct of the Protector, nor did he, as member for Knaresborough in the parliament of 1659, support Richard Cromwell's adherents in their efforts to procure his succession as protector with unlimited powers of action. In the new council of state appointed to hold office from 1 January 1660, he was the last of the ten non- parliamentary members. When the estates of his uncle, Sir Henry Slingsby, the unfortunate cavalier who suffered for his devotion to the royal cause, were sequestered, they were bought in for his family by Mr. Stapylton and Slingsby Bethel; the letters which passed between them on this matter are printed in the Diary of Sir Henry Slingsby (1836), pp. 344‚Äì54, 411. After the Restoration Through success in trade and through his family descent, he acquired considerable property in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and for many years after the Restoration he passed a retired life in London, living on his means, and taking no active part in opposition to a government which he distrusted. But on 24 June 1680 Bethel, who was a member of the Worshipful Company of Leathersellers (elected Master for 1692-93), and Henry Cornish, were chosen sheriffs of London and Middlesex, though they were unable to serve in consequence of their not having taken the oaths commanded by the Corporation Act. The country was divided into two parties through religious and political differences; Bethel and his colleague being the candidates of the whig and popular party in the city. Roger North, the tory historian, in his Examen, p. 93, says of them that 'the former used to walk about more like a corncutter than sheriff of London. He kept no house, but lived upon chops, whence it is proverbial for not feasting \\"to Bethel the city\\"'; and Dryden, in the first part of his Absalom and Achitophel threw at Bethel, under the name of Shimei, all the slanders of his opponents. By Burnet the whig historian Bethel was styled 'a known republican in principle' and 'a sullen and wilful man,' and he adds that the selection of these candidates gave some plausibility to the rumour that the king would not have justice done him against his enemies, as Bethel 'had expressed his approving the late king's death in very indecent terms', whilst their taking the sacrament, though they were independents, to qualify themselves for the office, damaged the anti- court party (History of own Times (1823 ed.), ii. 241-43). This last remark of Burnet refers to the fact that before the date of the second election Bethel and Cornish had duly qualified, and that thereupon they were elected by a large majority over the court candidates. On their retirement in 1681 they were thanked by the grand jury for the city, but Bethel was defeated on 5 September in his candidature for the aldermanship of Bishopsgate ward. The sheriffs were accused, with Sir Robert Clayton and others, of having visited Edward Fitzharris in Newgate with a message from Lord Howard that nothing would save his life but a discovery of the popish plot ; but the accusation was promptly denied in a pamphlet called Truth vindicated, 1681, which is reprinted in the State Trials, viii. 411-25. Several pamphlets were published on the conduct of the sheriffs in taking the sacrament, and on Bethel's attempt to be returned for Southwark at the election of February 1681. A folio tract published in his interest at this election, entitled The Vindication of Slingsby Bethel (1681), gave an emphatic denial to the assertion of his antagonists that he was a papist, a Jesuit, a cruel soldier in the parliamentary army, a judge of the late king, and an assistant at the scaffold when King Charles was executed. He was defeated at the poll for the borough of Southwark, and in the following October was fined five marks for assaulting a watchman at the election day, the fact being that he had removed two men who were preventing his electors from tendering their votes (The Trial of Slinqsby Bethel (1681), and State Trials, viii. 747-58). In the same month of October 1681, Bethel showed his liberality by a gift of several hundred pounds for the relief of poor prisoners for debt. In July 1682 he thought it prudent to retire to Hamburg, and there he remained until February 1689. Whilst absent he was found guilty and heavily fined, with several others (8 May 1683), for an assault on the preceding midsummer day at the election of sheriffs, a proceeding which was generally condemned. After the accession of William III and Mary II the convicted persons presented a petition to the king, praying him to except out of his act of grace all those who were concerned in this prosecution (The humble Petition of Sir Thomas Pilkinyton, Slingsby Bethel, &c.;) Bethel died early in February 1697. In Foster's Yorkshire Pedigrees (vol. ii.) he is said to have married Mary Burrell of Huntingdon; but if this statement be correct, he was a widower in 1681. Works Bethel was the author of several works. In 1659 he published A true and impartial Narrative of the most material Debates and Passages in the late Parliament reprinted in Somers Tracts (1748), iv. 524-33, in vol. vi. of the 1809 edition of the same work, and again as an appendix to his anonymous tract, The Interest of Princes and States, 1680. Most of the discourses in the last-mentioned volume were written many years previously, when the author was on his travels. They advocated freedom of trade and liberty of conscience. The World's Mistake in Oliver Cromwell (anon.), 1668, contained a severe censure of Cromwell's foreign policy, and of his conduct towards Lilburne and Sir Henry Vane. Another of Bethel's anonymous pamphlets, Observations on the Letter written to Sir Thomas Osborn, 1673, by the Duke of Buckingham, advocated the support of the Dutch Republic against France. The last of his works, The Providence of God observed through several ages towards this Nation (anon.), 1691, republished in 1694 and 1697, dealt mainly with the proceedings under the Stuarts for the establishment of arbitrary power.

He then relocated back to the place of his birth during his teenage years. He began performing under his stage name, taken from a character in the G.I. Joe comic books, while still in his teens. He honed his talents on several local sound systems before entering the studio. Career His first single, 1989's \\"Respect Woman\\", was produced by his uncle, Tuff Gong engineer Delroy \\"Spiderman\\" Thompson.Moskowitz, David V. (2006) Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, , p. 184-5 His next single, \\"Na Go Work\\", featured Tricia McKay, giving him his first hit, and bringing him to the attention of producers Captain Sinbad and Carl Nelson. Together they released a string of hit dancehall singles, including \\"Shoot to Kill\\", \\"Merciless Bad Boy\\", and \\"Ze Taurus\\", which featured tough, gangsta rap-style lyrics in keeping with the current trends of that time. In 1990, Cobra began working with producer Donovan Germain and songwriter Dave Kelly on the Penthouse Records label. This partnership spawned a series of major hits in Jamaica, including \\"Yush\\", \\"Gundelero\\", \\"Bad Boy Talk\\", and \\"Feeling Lonely\\" (with Beres Hammond). He released his first full-length album in 1991, entitled Bad Boy Talk, and over the next year worked with several different producers on yet more hit tracks (\\"O.P.P\\" with King Jammy, \\"Tek Him\\" with Bobby Digital, \\"Be Patient\\" with Sly & Robbie). In 1991 and 1992, Mad Cobra broke into the UK Reggae charts with five number one hits, bringing with it a backlash over concerns about the anti-gay sentiments of tracks such as \\"Crucifixion\\". In the wake of his British success, Mad Cobra signed a deal in America with Columbia Records. His next LP was entitled Hard to Wet, Easy to Dry, and featured \\"Flex\\", a single which interpolated elements of The Temptations' \\"Just My Imagination\\". It was a smash hit, topping the US Rap Singles chart, hitting #7 on the R&B; chart, and peaking at #13 on the Billboard Hot 100. The success of the single propelled the album to #125 on the Billboard Top 200, but the follow-up, \\"Legacy\\", failed to chart, and for the next several years Cobra's hitmaking remained primarily in Jamaica with songs such as 1993's \\"Mek Noise\\" and \\"Matti Haffie Move\\". Around this time, Cobra became involved in rivalries with fellow reggae artists Ninjaman and Buju Banton. He also made a guest appearance on rap group Run-D.M.C.'s \\"What's Next\\" on their album Down with the King. In 1994, Cobra returned with Venom, again recording with King Jammy. Jamaican hit singles from the 1994-1995 period included \\"Length and Bend\\", \\"Fat and Buff\\", and \\"Selassie I Rules\\", now adopting \\"conscious\\" lyrics. In 1996, Columbia Records released Milkman in the US market. The album peaked at #12 on Billboard's Top Reggae Albums chart and featured a minor hit, \\"Big Long John\\", which charted briefly on the US Dance and R&B; Singles charts. In 1998, a track with Mr. Vegas entitled \\"Guns High\\" charted in some countries in Europe, and a number of re-releases of his Jamaican material were issued on VP. Further albums were issued in 2001 (Cobra) and 2004 (Words of Warning). Most recently, Cobra was heard on \\"Cobrastyle\\", from Teddybears' 2004 album, Fresh and reissued in 2006 on their album Soft Machine. Personal life On the night of 11 May 2010, Mad Cobra was shot three times in the upper body near his home in Braeton, only a day after another dancehall artist, Oneil Edwards of the group Voice Mail, was also shot in Duhaney Park. He was carried to the Spanish Town Hospital for treatment. It was later ascertained that the vehicle Mad Cobra was traveling in had shone its light on a group of men and this had angered them. When Mad Cobra came out to appease the men, he was shot. He was released from hospital later that week. On the following Monday night, his house was shot up by unknown assailants but no one was injured during the incident.

Biography Sakai Tadakatsu was the sixth son of Sakai Ietsugu, castellan of Yoshida Castle and son of Sakai Tadatsugu (1527‚Äì1596), who was a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Tadakatsu's childhood name was Kog≈çr≈ç, and when he underwent his genpuku ceremony, he was awarded a kanji from the name of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Hidetada as a special mark of favor, becoming \\"Tadakatsu\\". Plutschow, Herbert. (1995). \\"Japan's Name Culture: The Significance of Names in a Religious, Political and Social Context, p.53. He became daimy≈ç of Takada Domain in Echigo Province (100,000 koku) on the death of his father in 1618. However, only one year later, he was transferred to Matsushiro Domain in Shinano Province by order of the shogunate, with the same nominal kokudaka. Three years later, in 1622, when the shogunate dispossessed the Mogami clan, Tadakatsu was transferred again, to become daimy≈ç of Sh≈çnai Domain. At that time, his kokudaka was increased to 138,000 koku. One of his first actions on becoming daimy≈ç of Sh≈çnai was to begin the construction of Tsuruoka Castle as a replacement for the dilapidated Kamegasaki Castle. However, the completed Tsuruoka Castle was given to his grandson, Sakai Tadayoshi, and he continued to reside at the old Kamegasaki Castle after his retirement. It was unusual for a domain, especially of this size, to have two castles in violation of the shogunate's \\"one domain - one castle\\" edict, and was a mark of the high standing the Sakai clan enjoyed within the shogunate. On the other hand, funding of this castle resulted in higher taxation, which caused unrest in the domain, even to the point where petitions were sent directly to the shogunate in Edo in 1634 complaining about misgovernment. In his final years, Tadakatsu instigated an O-Ie S≈çd≈ç by attempting to disinherit his own son, Sakai Tadamasa, in favor of his younger brother, Sakai Tadashige in 1642. This action was greatly opposed by the domain's senior advisors and kar≈ç and Tadakatsu died in 1647 before the issue was resolved.

He played for the Boston Red Sox and Houston Astros. Amateur career Sprowl attended George D. Chamberlain High School and was a star pitcher at the University of Alabama. In 1976, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and received the league's Outstanding Pro Prospect award, and helped lead Wareham to the league title.

Professional career =Boston Red Sox= Sprowl is best known for losing two critical games in the 1978 pennant race between the Red Sox and the New York Yankees. Before he was called up to the majors, Sprowl had compiled a 9-3 record in the AA Eastern League.\\"Bobby Sprowl Minor League Statistics & History\\". baseball- reference.com. Retrieved 2010-11-2. Boston's minor league organization claimed that he \\"had ice water in his veins,\\"Neyer, Rob. Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders (2006), p. 184. and manager Don Zimmer gave Sprowl three starts late in the season. Sprowl's first start was in Baltimore on September 5, where he went seven innings, allowing four runs (three earned) on five hits and three walks, but took the loss when Orioles ace (and future Hall-of-Famer) Jim Palmer stifled the Red Sox, who got a second-inning run on a Dwight Evans RBI double, and then nothing more. Sprowl carried the 1-0 lead into the bottom of the seventh, having allowed only two hits to that point, but then surrendered a game-tying home run to Lee May. It was alleged that if Boston left-fielder Jim Rice had not turned the wrong way, he could have caught May's hit, which barely cleared a seven-foot fence in left field. Instead he lunged at the last minute and knocked the ball into the bullpen. Andres Mora then grounded through the legs of Red Sox third baseman Butch Hobson, reaching second base. (This was Hobson's second error of the game and 35th of the season.). Sprowl retired Rick Dempsey on a grounder to shortstop, as pinch- runner Mike Dimmel advanced to third, and then with the infield playing in, Carlos Lopez hit a soft liner that didn't even reach the outfield on the fly, but dropped for a hit and allowed Dimmel to score the eventual winning run. (Sprowl retired the next two batters to end the inning, but gave up a hit and a walk to start the bottom of the eighth, and those runners eventually scored when relief pitcher Dick Drago allowed a two-out, two-strike pinch-hit double by Terry Crowley, providing Baltimore an insurance margin. Zimmer had told Drago to pitch around Crowley [\\"It doesn't matter if you walk Crowley. We can still work to Dempsey.\\"], but was ignored.) The Red Sox players lauded Sprowl's effort (\\"The kid only threw three or four bad pitches all night,\\" said catcher Carlton Fisk, \\"but he kept apologizing to me.\\") and Zimmer decided to give him a second start. His second start was on September 10 against the New York Yankees, in the fourth game of a four-game series at Fenway Park, after the Yankees had already defeated Mike Torrez, Jim Wright, and Dennis Eckersley to draw within one game of Boston. Zimmer passed over veterans Bill \\"Spaceman\\" Lee and Luis Tiant, who had dominated the Yankees during their careers. (Lee, for example, won 12 out of 17 decisions against the Yankees in 10 years with Boston. Then again, Lee had been pulled from the rotation after losing his last seven starts, had barely pitched since then because he had publicly feuded with Zimmer, and it's arguable that what Lee did against the Yankees in 1969 didn't have much relevance in 1978. The 37-year-old Tiant had thrown a two-hit shutout in Baltimore the night after Sprowl's start, and would have been working on three days' rest had Zimmer chosen to advance him in the rotation.) Sprowl walked the first two batters, got Thurman Munson to hit into a double play, but was unable to retire Reggie Jackson and escape the inning, surrendering an RBI single. He then walked Lou Piniella and Chris Chambliss and was pulled. (Reliever Bob Stanley allowed a hit to drive in two more runs, which were charged to Sprowl, before finishing the inning.) The Yankees won the game, 7-4 (although Jack Brohamer came close to a tying 3-run home run in the 9th), tying Boston for the division lead, and subjecting Zimmer to much second-guessing, due to Sprowl's perceived \\"nerves\\". Tiant started the next night against Baltimore and took a 4-1 lead into the 8th before tiring and surrendering three straight hits to open the frame; Stanley allowed the tying run, but no more, and the Red Sox scored in the bottom of the 8th to win the game and briefly reclaim first place, as the Yankees were idle. However, the Red Sox then lost their next three games (two in Cleveland to the lowly Indians) and were 1.5 games behind the Yankees when they arrived in New York on September 15, which would have been Sprowl's next start. Perhaps due to previous criticism, Zimmer this time opted to bypass Sprowl and start Tiant on short rest; Tiant lasted only 3.2 innings and allowed all four runs in the Red Sox' 4-0 defeat. Sprowl was not used at all against the Yankees that weekend (Torrez and Eckersley started, both likewise on three days' rest, and pitched well), but started the Monday (September 18) game in Detroit. He allowed three runs in 5 innings, leaving with a 4-3 lead. (Stanley blew the save in the eighth, but Boston won it in the 11th.) This would be Sprowl's last start of the season, as Zimmer went with a four-man rotation of Tiant, Torrez, Eckersley, and Stanley for the final two weeks. (Torrez and Eckersley continued to pitch well on short rest; Tiant was knocked out four batters into the September 19 game at Detroit [which Boston rallied to win], but was more effective thereafter; perhaps only pitching 3.2 innings on the 15th and to just four batters on the 19th enabled him to be essentially well-rested for his three remaining starts. [Stanley was 1-1 in his two starts.]) Overall, Sprowl went 0-2 with a 6.39 earned run average with Boston. =Houston Astros= The following season, Sprowl was traded to the Astros. He pitched in 19 games over the next three years, mostly in middle relief. He was sent back to the minors in 1982, and spent three seasons in the Astros and Baltimore Orioles organizations. The closest he ever got to the majors again was three games for the Astros' top affiliate, the Tucson Toros. He ended his major-league career with an 0-3 record in four years.

Only two were built. The aircraft was flown to Wichita for sister company Stearman Aircraft to use as a demonstrator but with the poor economy at the time, none were sold. The aircraft was sold to a wealthy pilot in New York and during its delivery, it passed through Wright Field in order to allow a thorough examination by Army Air Corps Engineers as the Air Corps was still using obsolete biplanes. After being rarely flown during 1932, the aircraft was sold to a new owner who kept it at Roosevelt Field until it was flipped over at a nearby airport. The aircraft was repaired at the Stearman factory in Wichita and used as an experimental test platform for various flap designs until it crashed due to a wing structural failure on May 4, 1934.

The constitution was adopted by the National Assembly on 29 February 1920 and replaced the provisional constitution adopted on 13 November 1918. The constitution, modelled after constitutions of established democracies, was conceived in the light of Hans Kelsen's contribution to constitutional law. The system of government the constitution introduced made Czechoslovakia the most westernized of all of the central and eastern European nations on the verge of World War II. The constitution created a parliament but also a president and cabinet, sharing powers of executive branch. Beneath them was a judiciary that was advanced with many levels of courts delegated for various types of cases. Parliamentary democracy The parliament, the National Assembly, was bicameral. The Chamber of Deputies consisted of 300 members elected for 6 years. The Senate consisted of 150 members elected for 8 years. Suffrage was exercised by all citizens, of both sexes, over the age of 21 for elections to the lower chamber; and over the age of 26 for elections to the senate. Candidates for the lower chamber had to be at least 30 years of age; and for the senate, at least 45 years of age. The parliamentary system that was installed created a complicated system of proportional representation, with relatively few constituents for each representative. It was possible to get a seat with as little as 2.6 percent of the vote. This allowed for a great variety of political parties to emerge, with no clear front runner or leading political entity. A typical Chamber of Deputies during the First Republic had well over 10 factions represented. With so many parties as part of the national forum, it was all but impossible for one party to win the 151 seats needed for a majority. No party came close to being able to govern alone until the Communist Party was able to secure 38% percent of the votes in 1946; before then, no party won more than 25 percent of the vote. Since it was so hard to secure a majority, the government was at times stalled out and unable to effectively legislate. Under the circumstances, Czechoslovak prime ministers were fairly weak figures compared to their counterparts in the rest of Europe. In most cases, the prime minister was more the chairman of the cabinet than its leader. If parliament rejected a government bill, the cabinet could unanimously refer the proposed law to referendum. No recourse was made to this constitutional provision during the First Republic. Presidency The president was elected by both chambers of parliament in joint session (acting in accordance with the standing orders of the lower chamber). The presidential term was seven years, with no more than two in a row (the first president was exempted from this provision). Candidates for the presidency had to be at least 35 years old. The framers intended for the prime minister and cabinet to hold the real power. Hence, the constitutional powers of the president were limited. However, the personal prestige of the first two presidents, Tom√°≈° Masaryk and Edvard Bene≈°, and the instability of successive governments (for example, Masaryk's presidency saw 10 cabinets headed by nine statesmen) meant that the president wielded in practice more authority than the plain text of the constitution suggested. The constitution laid down that all executive functions rested with the government except as expressly assigned to the president. However, the president could address written or verbal messages to parliament, appoint and dismiss ministers, attend and preside over cabinet meetings, and demand written reports from individual ministers. Hence, presidential influence on the executive was in practice considerable. The president concluded and ratified international treaties, saving that treaties imposing personal or military burdens upon the subject or involving territorial changes required parliamentary consent. The president could veto bills by sending them back to parliament, with accompanying observations. Parliament in turn had the right to override the veto with a simple majority of both houses. If the Senate sustained the veto, then the Chamber of Deputies could override it unilaterally by a subsequent vote by means of a three-fifths majority. The president was army's commander-in-chief, with the power to appoint all high-ranking officers. He also had the right to appoint university professors, judges and senior civil servants. Whenever the presidency was vacant, most of its functions were assumed by the prime minister. Regional autonomy In order to satisfy the protection of national minorities required by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the constitution referred explicitly to the terms of the treaty. =Carpathian Ruthenia= Carpathian Ruthenia had been formally included within the Czecho-Slovak state from 1919. The 1920 constitution provided for the autonomy of the territory. However, these provisions remained a dead letter in practice, as the supposedly autonomous institutions were controlled from Prague. =Language law= A constitutional act was adopted alongside the constitution on the same day, and was considered one of the constitutional texts. It established the \\"Czechoslovak language\\" (i.e. Czech and Slovak considered as two official dialects of one language) as an official language, but also granted status to minority languages in areas where at least 20% of the citizens spoke such a language. Development of the constitution The Constitution of 1920 would serve as the guiding document for the government of Czechoslovakia until World War II. And even after Czechoslovakia came under the control of the Soviet Union, the constitution would still continue to govern the way the state‚Äôs internal affairs by serving as the underlying example for the country‚Äôs next constitution, with provisions being made for a separate and more localized Slovak government. These local governments from that point forward would control Slovakia, with the government established by the constitution ruling over the more basic common matters as well as the Czech half of the nation. The 1920 constitution was replaced on 9 May 1948 by the Ninth-of-May Constitution, following the Communist takeover in February 1948.

Romani people in Kosovo share a very similar culture, tradition, non-distinguishing physical appearance, with Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians, most of them do not want to be put together as one minority but as distinct minorities. Mainly there are historical differences claimed. Roma speak Roma language in most cases, but also the languages that surround them, such as Serbian and Albanian. In 2011 there were 36,694 Romani, Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians living in Kosovo, or around 2% of the population. Many Romani were targeted by the Kosovo Liberation Army along with Serbs during the Kosovo War as they were considered to be allied with Serbs and Serbian national interests. Romani in Kosovo are much depleted from their former numbers, and have been in both stationary and nomadic residence there since the 15th century. The Kosovo Liberation Army were reported to have expelled 50,000 Romani from Kosovo, forcing them to take refuge in central Serbia, but many of them have since returned to Kosovo. Subgroups Romani girl in Prizren As in other parts of the Balkans, the denomination of Romani has always been subject to outside pressure. In the official census, the labels Romani and (Kosovo) Egyptians were used. After the war and encouraged by the international community, the label Romani, Ashkali and Kosovo Egyptians and its abbreviation RAE became more common. Whereas the Ashkali and Kosovo Egyptians assert their distinct origin, this is sometimes contested by Kosovo Romani who claim that all three groups are actually Romani subgroups.

Romani weddings to non-Romani (Gadje, outsiders) is extremely rare. Egyptians, Romani and Ashkalija however do not classify one another as Gadje.  Education  Formal education is of a poor standard, especially among women, due both to native beliefs that formal education is unnecessary, and to discrimination in education in the formal schools who are ill-equipped for the needs of Romani children. Serbianising and Albanizing tendencies have also led to the Romani sliding from the educational mainstream. Third-level education is not attained by the majority of Roma, and of those who do, they are mostly only half Romani, with there being Serb, Turk or Albanian heritage, too.  Discrimination Refugee camp of Kosovar Romani in southern Central Serbia, close to Kosovo Following the cessation of the Kosovo war in June 1999 and the subsequent return of ethnic Albanians from abroad, approximately four fifths of Kosovo's pre-1999 RAE population had been expelled from their homes. Many Kosovo Albanians regarded the Roma as having collaborated with the Yugoslav Army. Roma were claimed to have assisted the Serbian police in plundering Albanian homes and shops to supply the military action, and in burying the Albanian dead. According to Roma accounts, the Yugoslav authorities coerced them into providing assistance. Many Roma were also recruited into the Yugoslav Army to \\"help terrorise Albanians\\" and Roma homes were marked with an \\"R\\" on their doors to distinguish them from Albanian houses when the Serbian paramilitaries arrived to plunder. Albanians regarded these acts as further evidence that Roma had allied themselves with the enemies of the Albanian nation, and thus many Roma were targeted by the returning Albanians. The departure of the Yugoslav army and police was followed by a series of \\"retaliatory attacks\\". By June 1999, the Romani mahala of Mitrovica was burned down and the inhabitants fled. Around 3,500 Roma took shelter in a school in Kosovo Polje following threats and the Roma community of Gjakova were warned to leave their homes. The Romani quarter of Brekoc in Gjakova and Dusanova in Prizren were also burned down. German KFOR troops also discovered 15 severely beaten Roma, accused of taking part in looting and collaborating with the Serbs, in a police office in Prizren that was being used by the KLA as a prison. 5,000 displaced Roma gathered in a KFOR built camp in Obiliƒá where they were subject to insults and attacks by Albanians. Romani in Kosovo today live in constant fear of further ethnic unrest. Romani displaced in North Kosovo are today housed in lead-infested camps in North Mitrovica.See also Viewpoint (Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights): European migration policies discriminate against Roma people by Thomas Hammarberg, 22/02/10 There is ongoing campaign for rehousing and proper health provisions for the families affected, and a fatality estimate ranges from 27 to 81. =Mitrovica camps= Returning IDPs were housed by UNMIK in North Mitrovica in a lead mine site, and 27 died of lead poisoning.

She won a silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and participated at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. A playmaking midfielder, she played professional club football in Japan and the United States. Club career Born in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, Liu excelled in basketball and athletics but did not play football until she was 17 years old. Her parents were initially reluctant to let her play what they saw as a masculine sport. In 1994 Liu joined Japanese second tier club Tasaki Perule FC. She helped win promotion in her first season and remained with the club until 1997. At the 2000 WUSA Draft, Liu was selected by Philadelphia Charge in the first round, second overall behind compatriot Sun Wen. In the United States Liu experienced a culture shock; she bought only raw fruit and vegetables from the supermarket as in China she had been in regimented training camps for so long that she never learned to cook. In the 2001 WUSA season 34-year-old veteran Liu was a success, leading the team on goals (10) and points (22). She was the first woman to win WUSA's Player of the Week in two consecutive weeks, and the first woman to win it three times. Charge coach Mark Krikorian said of Liu: \\"She has been one of the greatest center midfielders in the world\\". In 2002 Liu was less effective, contributing two goals and two assists for six points in her 20 regular season appearances (11 starts). She retired at the end of the season. International career At the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Liu played the full 80 minutes in all four of China's games. The hosts reached the quarter-finals before losing 1‚Äì0 to Sweden. In the first ever FIFA Women's World Cup match, Liu scored twice in China's 4‚Äì0 win over eventual finalists Norway on 16 November 1991. In 1996 she won the silver medal with the Chinese team. She played all five matches and scored one goal. At the 1997 AFC Women's Championship Liu scored four goals in China's 10‚Äì0 semi-final win over Taiwan and two goals in the 2‚Äì0 final win over obdurate North Korea. She was named tournament MVP. Liu was named in the 16-player All-Star team at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup. She scored the winning goal in the 2‚Äì1 first round win over Sweden and two more in the 5‚Äì0 semi-final rout of defending champions Norway, securing China's place in the final, where they lost a controversial penalty shootout to the United States. In 2000, she was a member of the Chinese team which finished fifth in the Olympic women's tournament. She played all three matches. In 2003 Liu took a role as deputy secretary general of the Beijing Football Association.

It is a 151‚Äìfoot waterfall that flows over basalt from volcanic eruptions millions of years ago. Below the ridge down into the ravine through which the water falls can be seen the vertical dikes of basalt that cut through the horizontal Koloa lava flows. The name \\"≈åpaekaa\\" means rolling shrimp, \\"opae\\" being Hawaiian for \\"shrimp,\\" and \\"kaa\\" for \\"rolling\\". The name dates back to days when the native freshwater shrimp Atyoida bisulcata were plentiful in the stream and were seen rolling and tumbling down the falls and into the churning waters at the fall's base. Visually, this is a spectacular waterfall and is one of the island's few waterfalls that can be seen from the road. It flows year round and therefore is not seasonal. Most of the time it falls in a double cascade but the two sides may become one after a heavy rain. There is a highway overlook which provides a panoramic view of the wide falls and the valley below. The best time of day to see the falls is in full sunlight when the water sparkles the most. If the day is cloudy the view is less spectacular.  View from highway  The highway parking lot offers an excellent overview of the double ≈åpaekaa Falls. The tops of the Makeleha Mountains can be seen in the background while tropical birds soar through the valley below. The best view of the falls is seen by taking the sidewalk past the parking lot and walking toward the bridge. The Wailua River can be viewed by crossing the road at the pedestrian crossing sign.  Trail closures  It is not possible to climb down to where the water falls into a pool. The trail has been blocked by a steel fence since 2006 when two women fell off an unofficial but well-publicized rocky path to the pool. Two other hikers found their bodies away from the pool. At the time they fell from the path the state had already posted a sign at head of trail saying \\"Danger Keep Out ‚Äî Hazardous Conditions\\". This means that currently neither the top nor the bottom of the waterfall can be accessed on foot. However, unofficially there are paths to both places, so-called \\"secret trails\\", which circulate via guide books, websites and by word of mouth. \\"It's clear that anything that may look like a trail around ≈åpaekaa is not a state- sanctioned trail,\\" said the head of the island's official trails system. State park officials have made it clear that the trail was never part of the park's official trail system and that the steel blockade to the trail will remain in place for the foreseeable future. Violating the blockade is considered a misdemeanor with a possible penalty of a fine of up to $1,000 and up to 30 days in jail. The closing of these \\"unofficial\\" trails is very controversial and many hikers think that people should be allowed to take their chances. They feel that warning sign and other state measures are merely an attempt for the state to avoid lawsuits. There are rumors that there is an unkempt hunter trail leading to the bottom, where there is access to the large, deep pool at the bottom of the falls. Many deny the existence of the trail due to the danger in following these trails.  Directions  Once on island, the falls can be accessed by Route 580. At the milepost 6, 580 heads inland for three miles (5 km). Route 580 is called Kuamoo Road at this point and it is to the ≈åpaekaa Falls parking lot and overlook. Route 580 goes through a notch in the ridge that the Wailua River has eroded. There are no state-maintained trails to either the top or the bottom of the waterfall from the Kuamoo Road overlook.  Nearby sights  On the opposite side of the road near the falls is the relatively well-preserved ancient temple of Poliahu Heiau, also thought to have once been a luakini. It is named after the snow goddess, Poliahu, sister of Pele, the goddess of fire, lightning, volcanoes and violence. Also nearby is the bell stone believed to have been used by ancient Hawaiians to ward off danger. Striking the bell with another stone results in a distinctive low frequency sound that can be heard for at least a mile down the valley. Wailua Falls is also nearby.

It won the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and the Claude Jutra Award for the best feature film by a first-time film director in Canada. Plot Eve, a precocious nine-year-old with an overactive imagination, was born in the Year of the Fire Horse, notorious among Chinese families for producing the most troublesome children. Dinners around Eve's family table are a raucous affair, where old world propriety and new world audacity mix in even measure. But as summer approaches, it seems like Eve's carefree childhood days are behind her. When her mother chops down their apple tree ‚Äî a superstitious omen ‚Äî bad luck worms its way into their family in unexpected, tragic ways. Forced to grow up too fast, Eve learns to take pleasure in life's small gifts ‚Äî like a goldfish she believes to be the reincarnated spirit of her beloved grandmother. Meanwhile, Eve's older sister Karena is going through changes of her own, exploring a newfound fascination with Christianity. Soon, crucifixes pop up next to the Buddha in the family's house, and Eve must contend with a Sunday school class where her wild imagination is distinctly out of place. Caught between her sister's quest for premature sainthood and her own sense of right and wrong, Eve faces the challenges of childhood with fanciful humor and wide-eyed wonder. Along the way, she proves that sometimes the most troublesome children are the ones that touch our hearts most deeply.

Development During development of the game, project leader Martin Edmondson stated, \\"No code is shared between DD2 and Monster Trucks (with the exception of surrounding code such as sound and sprite routines). Monster Trucks started development about three quarters through DD1 and is a game based on those famous car-crushing, monster pick-up trucks with the oversized wheels.\\" Reception Thunder Truck Rally received overwhelmingly middling reviews. Glenn Rubenstein described it as \\"A fairly average driving game with a few new bells and whistles\\", Next Generation as \\"Not horrible, but nothing special either\\", and IGN as \\"a good, solid title, although the grainy graphics do grate sometimes.\\" GamePro concluded that \\"For off-road fans, it's a pretty solid buy, but run-of-the- mill racing buffs should get enough with only one rental.\\" Most critics found that the game's car crushing mode, which they anticipated would have the most immediate appeal to players, is shallow and ultimately unexciting. Some also complained that in endurance mode, the guiding arrow tends to veer unexpectedly, which they felt was unfair, since the AI opponents always immediately know how to take a turn. Both Rubenstein and Next Generation remarked that while the controls are generally very good, the physics make it too easy to go off on a high jump that severely damages the player's truck. Other common criticisms were the extensive pop-up and weak sound effects, while subjects of praise included the rigorous course design, and the numerous modes and options available.

Biography Clifford Smith was born in Kingston in 1974.Barrow, Steve & Dalton, Peter (2004) \\"The Rough Guide to Reggae, 3rd edn.\\", Rough Guides, , p.345 The moniker \\"Mr. Vegas\\" was given to Smith by his schoolyard football-mates, who thought that he kicked the ball like a Las Vegas dancer. In his early years as a singjay, Vegas sang covers of Jamaican hits at local parties and shows, and acquired a reputation as a troublemaker for his lyrics. During a scuffle over stolen master tapes, Vegas was hit in the face with a crowbar and had his jaw wired shut for six weeks. Vegas claims that, after hearing Beenie Man's hit \\"Who Am I\\", he immediately demanded that his still-healing jaw be unwired, changing his speech pattern but allowing him to practice toasting. He found fame in 1998 with hits such as \\"Yu Sure\\", \\"Jack It Up\\", and \\"Latest News\\". For his first major hit, Vegas versioned the wildly popular \\"Playground\\" Riddim (Sean Paul's \\"Infiltrate\\" among others) to create \\"Nike Air\\", which became a huge hit in Jamaica.

In 1998, his debut album, Heads High was released, which hit No. 5 on the US Reggae chart. Vegas won a MOBO for Best Reggae Artist for the Heads High album as well. 2000's single \\"Hot Gal Today\\" was a minor hit on the US R&B; chart, peaking at No. 66. In 2001, he issued Damn Right, featuring guest appearances from Shaggy and Big Yard; this album went to No. 2 on the US Reggae chart. 2004 saw the release of the Pull Up LP on Delicious Vinyl Records, and the title track scraped the bottom of the Billboard Top 200, peaking at No. 98 (as well as No. 68 on the R&B; chart). In 2006, he did a soca collaboration with Machel Montano, \\"Dance with You\\" on Montano's B.O.D.Y. album. His latest, 2007's Hot It Up, featured the Jamaican hits \\"Hot Wuk\\", \\"Taxi Fare\\" and \\"Tek Weh Yuhself\\". In 2008, Mr. Vegas also recorded \\"On the Floor\\" with Trinidadian artist Destra Garcia on her album, Soca or Die. Retirement In September 2008, Smith announced that he was retiring from the music industry, citing unhappiness with his work and a desire to spend more time with his children and be \\"closer to God Almighty\\". Although he had been suffering from ill-health for some time, he denied that this was a factor in his retirement.Brooks, Sadeke (2008) \\"Mr 'di do' Vegas quits music ‚Äì Turns to God and kids \\", Jamaica Star, October 2008 However, in 2009 and 2010 he made new songs such as \\"Man a Gallis\\", \\"Can't Stop Now\\" (Major Lazer), \\"Mix Up Peggy\\", \\"Wanna See You Move\\" (DJ GQ) and \\"Fi Get Rich\\".

He co-founded the Washington, D.C. branch of the Mattachine Society in 1961 with Franklin E. Kameny. He appeared in the 1967 CBS documentary, CBS Reports: The Homosexuals, under the pseudonym Warren Adkins.  Biography  Nichols was born on March 16, 1938 in Washington, D.C.. His father was an FBI agent. Nichols was raised in Chevy Chase, Maryland and came out as gay to his parents as a teenager. His parents divorced, and his mother was subsequently married to William B. Southwick, an abusive alcoholic who lived in Cocoa Beach, Florida, for six years. Nichols lived with the uncle and aunt of Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi for three years and learned Persian. Nichols dropped out of school at 12. He was inspired at age 15 by the poems of Walt Whitman and the works of Robert Burns. He recalled to Owen Keehnen that, as early as 1955, he was sharing Donald Webster Cory's book The Homosexual in America with his gay friends.  Activism  Nichols co- founded the Mattachine Society of Washington in 1961 with Frank Kameny, and the Mattachine Society of Florida in 1965. The Mattachine Society of Washington was independent of the national Mattachine Society, which had formally disbanded a few months earlier. Beginning in 1963, he chaired the Mattachine Society of Washington's Committee on Religious Concerns, which later developed into the Washington Area Council on Religion and the Homosexual. This organization was pioneering in forging links between the gay rights movement and the National Council of Churches. Nichols led the first gay rights march on the White House, in April 1965, and participated in the Annual Reminder pickets at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, held each July 4 from 1965 to 1969. He and other activists successfully lobbied the American Psychiatric Association to rescind its definition of homosexuality as a form of mental illness. In 1967, Nichols became one of the first Americans to talk openly about his homosexuality on national television when he appeared in CBS Reports: The Homosexuals, a CBS News documentary. Though he allowed himself to be interviewed on camera, Mr. Nichols used the pseudonym \\"Warren Adkins\\" in the broadcast because of his father, an FBI agent. His father had threatened him with death if the U.S. government found out Jack was his son and he lost his coveted security clearance. The use of the name \\"Warren\\" was in deference to one of Nichols' early lovers he met when visiting his aunt and uncle in Neptune Beach, Florida in 1961. Nichols had an early taste for simple country lovers and his lover, Warren, was from West Virginia. Eventually this passion for \\"hillbillies\\" would lead to the first great love of his life, Lige Clarke, who was from Kentucky. Due to his appearance in the documentary, Nichols was fired from his job at the International Inn located in Washington, D.C. the day after it aired.50 Years After 'The Homosexuals' - Advocate Writing career With his partner Lige Clarke, Nichols began writing the column \\"The Homosexual Citizen\\" for Screw magazine in 1968. \\"The Homosexual Citizen\\", which borrowed its title from the newspaper published by Mattachine D.C., was the first LGBT-interest column in a non-LGBT publication. As a result of this column, Nichols and Clarke became known as, \\"The most famous gay couple in America.\\" In 1969, after moving to New York City, Nichols and Clarke founded GAY, the first weekly newspaper for gay people in the United States distributed on newsstands. The publication continued until Clarke's murder just north of Veracruz, Mexico. From 1977-78, he served as the editor of Sexology. Nichols was hired in 1981 as the news editor of the San Francisco Sentinel. From February 1997, Nichols was Senior Editor at GayToday.com, an online newsmagazine. In November 2010, Jack Nichols' friend, Stephanie Donald, began LGBT-Today.com, in tribute to Nichols and the Gay Rights Movement and got most of the original staff of GayToday.com together including Frank Kameny who wrote exclusively for LGBT-Today.com until his death on October 11, 2011. Death He died on May 2, 2005, of complications from cancer of the saliva gland. His best friend, Steve Yates, was in attendance at the time of his death.

It followed the death of Crosby's MP Sir Graham Page, of the Conservative Party. Background The Crosby by-election took place against an almost unprecedented backdrop of division and disunity within both the Conservative and Labour parties, combined with social unrest and economic recession in the United Kingdom as a whole. The opposition Labour Party was riven by factionalism and divided over entryism - in particular, that of the Militant tendency. It expounded left-wing policies, with perceived weak leadership provided by Michael Foot, who was routinely ridiculed by the national press. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had recently sacked or neutralised the remaining allies of Edward Heath, the previous more moderate Conservative leader, and the country was being subjected to the full rigours of monetarism, her economic policy. Inflation was over 10%, with unemployment climbing towards three million, a figure not seen since the 1930s. In July 1981 the most intense and prolonged instance of public unrest in the United Kingdom in the late twentieth century had occurred in the Toxteth area of Liverpool, following on the heels of similar riots in the St Paul's area of Bristol, Handsworth and Brixton. Constituency Crosby was regarded as a very safe seat for the Conservatives. Page had sat as the constituency MP since the 1953 Crosby by-election, and the party had held the seat since its creation in 1950, also easily holding its predecessor seat, Waterloo since 1918. The constituency contained some of the wealthiest areas in the North of England. The districts of Blundellsands in Crosby and Freshfield in Formby had more in common with the likes of Surrey than they did with the nearby City of Liverpool. Only Waterloo and Seaforth, at the southern end of the constituency could be considered as working-class. The seat consisted of three main conurbations; Formby, to the north, Maghull, to the east, and Crosby, to the south. Crosby constituency had one of the top-ten highest levels of owner- occupation in the country, and had one of the largest electorates in England with over 83,000 voters. Notably, Crosby had one of the largest Roman Catholic electorates in England and Wales, with about one third of the voters adherents of the faith. There were no fewer than eighteen Catholic churches in the constituency, numerous Catholic schools including St. Mary's College, and several Catholic charities including Jospice. The Catholicism of the area could be ascribed to two factors: those of Liverpool-Irish ancestry whose families had migrated the six miles north from the city-centre over the previous century to become the middle-class intelligentsia, doctors, lawyers and the like; and a significant indigenous group who traced their roots to the village of Little Crosby, one of the oldest extant Catholic villages in England. Candidates At the 1979 general election, Page had gained more than half the votes cast. For the by-election, the Conservatives stood John Butcher, a chartered accountant and a Royal Navy reservist, living in Cheshire and working in Warrington. The Labour Party had taken second place in 1979, with just over a quarter of the vote. Their candidate had been Tony Mulhearn, a leading figure on Liverpool City Council, and a prominent member of the Militant tendency, a far left wing group with considerable influence in the city. For the by-election, the party instead chose John Backhouse, the Chair of the Crosby Labour Party, a local teacher and a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament activist. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) was formed by a split of some prominent figures on the right of the Labour Party in March 1981. Its main figures were the \\"Gang of Four\\" - Shirley Williams, Roy Jenkins, David Owen and Bill Rodgers. Of the four, Williams and Jenkins were out of Parliament, with the party keen for them to stand in by-elections under their new party label. Following the agreement of an electoral pact with the Liberal Party, who had come third in Crosby in 1979, with 15% of the vote, the two parties supported Jenkins in the 1981 Warrington by-election, where he narrowly failed to capture the seat. At Crosby, they agreed to support Williams in an attempt to become the SDP's first successful Parliamentary candidate. Williams, it transpired later, had no particular urge to return to what she described as \\"an old men's club\\", and felt her talents would be better used outside Parliament. However, her father, George Catlin, had been born in nearby Liverpool, and the constituency's large Roman Catholic electorate seemed tailor-made for a practising Catholic like Shirley Williams. The fourth candidate in 1979 had been from the Ecology Party, receiving 2.4% of the vote, in one of the party's better results. For the by-election, the party selected Richard Small, a local lecturer. John Desmond Lewis, a 22-year- old student from Hayes in Greater London, contested the election as the President of the Cambridge University Raving Loony Society. For the election, he changed his name by deed poll to Tarquin Fin-tim-lin-bin-whin-bim-lim-bus- stop-F'tang-F'tang-Ol√©-Biscuitbarrel, the outlandish name of a character from Monty Python's \\"Election Night Special\\" sketch. In the sketch, the character by that name wins Luton for the Silly Party.Chapman et al., Monty Python's Flying Circus: Just the Words Volume 1, London: Mandarin Paperbacks, 1990 (). Veteran candidate Bill Boaks stood as \\"Democratic Monarchist, Public Safety, White Resident\\", while Tom Keen stood in support of a Conservative-Liberal Alliance. John Kennedy stood to highlight the case of seven students at Middlesex Polytechnic who had been suspended after a sit-in protest demanding nursery facilities, while Donald Potter, a former Young Conservative and founder of the \\"Close Encounters\\" lonely heart group, stood to promote his idea of a national phone line for lonely people. Result Williams won the election, taking almost half the votes cast and became the first MP to be elected under the SDP label. The Conservatives and Labour both fell back by more than 15% of the vote and dropped to second and third positions respectively. For Labour, Backhouse took less than 10% of the vote and lost his deposit, while none of the other candidates achieved 1% of the votes cast. Jenkins won another seat for the SDP at the Glasgow Hillhead by-election in 1982, but the party suffered setbacks at the 1983 general election, and Williams lost Crosby to a new Conservative candidate aided by the fact that boundary changes had been implemented bringing Aintree into the constituency in place of Waterloo and Seaforth (which transferred to Bootle Constituency). When the results were declared, Lewis was referred to by the Returning Officer as \\"Mr Tarquin Biscuit-Barrel\\". He later worked with Screaming Lord Sutch to form the Official Monster Raving Loony Party for the 1983 Bermondsey by- election.

Formerly the site of the Abbey of Saint-Pierre, the site grew from the 10th century abbey to the cathedral completed in the 15th century, with the many structures at the site abandoned by the end of the 17th century. Today's ruins consist of a cathedral, refectory, dormitory, kitchen, cellars, turrets and ramparts. The cathedral has been declared a heritage monument in reflection of its Romanesque and Gothic architectural form. It was designated a monument historique on 30 January 1924. The cathedral belonged to the Diocese of Lu√ßon, with Roman Rites, and with St. Peter as the patron saint. History Around 1100, Abbot Pierre wrote two books on the founding and construction of the Abbey of Maillezais. The Abbot Pierre's account tells that during a hunting expedition in 976, Countess Emma, the wife of William IV, Duke of Aquitaine, discovered the ruins of a chapel dedicated to Saint Hilaire and decided to found an abbey at the site. The couple contributed to the structure's rebuilding and it became an important monastery in the Pays de la Loire. The new church was consecrated in 989 by Gombald, Archbishop of Bordeaux. Father Gausbert, cousin of Countess Emma, brought thirteen monks from √âglise Saint-Julien de Tours to create a Benedictine abbey, first settling in Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux, Vend√©e, about north of the current ruins. The abbey's jurisdiction later passed from √âglise Saint-Julien de Tours to √âglise Saint-Cyprien in Poitiers. In 1010, the Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux abbey moved to Maillezais, with groundbreaking for a new Maillezais chapel, soon after again dedicated to Saint Pierre (St. Peter).William V, Duke of Aquitaine was buried at the abbey's cloister in 1030. His sons Guillaume and Eudes chose to be buried in Maillezais as well. In May 1197, by the bull Officii nostri, Pope Clement III took the monastery of Maillezais under papal protection, listing all of its dependencies and properties.Lacurie, Joseph-Louis (1852). Histoire de l'abbaye de Maillezais depuis sa fondation jusqu'√† nos jours, suivie de pi√®ces justificatives la plupart in√©dites (in French). Fontenay-le- Comte: E. Fillon. p. 282 et seq. In 1225, Geoffroy d'Estissac, who was envious of Maillezais, attacked and looted the abbey. Excommunicated from the church, he went to Rome and apologized to the Pope in the presence of the abbot of Maillezais for his wrongful deeds. After he was pardoned, he restructured it with additional bays extending the nave. Under Abbot Geoffroy II Povereau in the early 14th century, it was a large property consisting of churches, priories, and large fertile land. The Abbey of Maillezais was located on an island in the waterlogged Marais Poitevin. The area was extensively developed in the early part of the 13th century, when the abbeys of Maillezais, Nieul- sur-l'Autise, Saint-Michel-en-Herm, and the Absie St. Maixent joined together for the project. The monks dug canals to manage the water and create more arable land. In 1317, after the final suppression of the Albigensians in France, Pope John XXII restructured the allocation of French bishoprics, creating two new episcopal sees, each with a cathedral, out of the diocese of Poitiers. Pope John XXII raised the status of Maillezais to that of diocese, with Saint-Pierre Cathedral (formerly the abbey church) becoming the seat of the new Bishop of Maillezais. The abbot of Maillezais, Geoffroy Povereau, was appointed the first bishop. The cathedral became a center of intellectual pursuits; in the early 16th century Fran√ßois Rabelais taught at the abbey for five years. A surviving bay of the Gothic transept The refurbishing of the cathedral was continued, and in the middle of the 14th century a Gothic transept was added and a bell was also provided. There were many improvements to the cathedral's interiors such as better furnishings, conversion of the abbot's residence into an episcopal palace, building of a monastery dormitory near the second cloister. However, what remains among the ruins of the cathedral are its eastern and southern wings. Among other bishops of the cathedral were Guillaume de Luc√© (1421‚Äì38) and Thibaud de Luc√© (1438‚Äì55), who were political counselors to Charles VII. Further improvements took place when Geoffrey d'Estissac of P√©rigord became the bishop in 1518. It was the last refurbishing done and the additions made were the choir of the cathedral and also the castle of Coulonges on l'Autise. During the period after 1528, when Rabelais had been in charge of the monastic order from 1524‚Äì28, there was internecine war between the Catholics and the Protestants. The cathedral was destroyed in 1562 in the course of the Reformation and subsequent Wars of Religion. A fortresslike aspect In 1589, Agrippa d'Aubign√©, a Protestant, a scholar and a poet, became the bishop and fortified the cathedral with a watch tower. The fort became a stronghold of the Protestants for the next thirty years till the Duke of Rohan succeeded him. When during the late 16th and early 17th century the Protestants of the Huguenots had converted it into a fort-like structure, the Catholics had to even baptize their children outside the city limits. It remained under the control of the Protestants till 1618. But by 1619 the cathedral was back under the control of the Catholics and Henri de Sourdis became the Bishop. In 1629, the Bishopric of Maillezais was one of the richest in France with a lease value of 35,000 livres. It remained the seat of the Bishopric of Maillezais until 1648, when Pope Innocent X transferred the bishopric to the St. Louis Cathedral of La Rochelle, in the Diocese of La Rochelle. The monastic community continued at the Maillezais site until 1666, when the entire site was abandoned. The cathedral site remained dormant till after the French Revolution when it was sold as national property to serve as a stone quarry. In 1840, it was returned to the people, who decided to maintain the cathedral as a heritage monument. It was designated a historical monument on 30 January 1924. It was only after 1996 that the General Council of the Vend√©e took interest in its restoration. Architectural and archaeological remains View of the ruins of Maillezais Cathedral The fa√ßade on the west gable of the church built in 1025, which consisted of two bays of naves flanked by two towers, is now fully open. The staircase to access the first floor, which existed originally, is also missing. The fortifications in the form of battlements built in the 15th century by Agrippa are still seen. Of the seven bays added with partial columns with capitals camouflaged by the fortifications, only the top four Romanesque bays are visible. A realignment is seen in this on account of the second floor raised in later years. Three large Gothic windows topped with dissimilar arcades provide light to the naves. Out of the high transepts, built in first half of the fourteenth century, only the north transept part is visible now. At the lower part of the walls of the transept decorated arches are seen, and in some part it is a door which provides views of the warheads. A decorated, arched cornice is seen at the second level and it has two large openings in the Gothic style. The bell tower has fully survived and from the top of the tower vistas of the marsh that surrounds the cathedral could be seen. Entrance to the tower is through a door decorated with carvings. The view from the tower also covers the northwest wall of the ruins. The fa√ßade on the northern side wall has five protective boxes, which were erected in the twelfth century. Archaeological excavations done at the cloister and near the refectory have revealed foundations of buildings‚Äîa kitchen, refectory, dormitory, and a chapter house, all built around a central garden. The kitchen had an octagonal layout. Tombs, pots, urns, remnants of columns, two capitals, butt of abbot copper enamels (dated to late thirteenth century), silos, washbasins, cellar (of 12th century) were also found. The fourteenth-century buildings such as the inn do not exist now. Excavation done in the south wing has revealed a salt cellar at the entrance which is a large vaulted room in the basement which was used by monks for making salt. At the ground floor level there are two rooms used for dining, with the kitchen located in the basement which had a central fireplace. On the upper floor there was a second dining room as part of the dormitory, with wooden fittings and a fireplace at the centre. A pier provided the approach to the moors which could be used for plying boats through its winding channels from where one can get views of the \\"imposing ruins of the abbey silhouetted in the sky\\".

One method is a block related design, in which two or more different conditions are alternated in order to determine the differences between the two conditions, or a control may be included in the presentation occurring between the two conditions. By contrast, event related designs are not presented in a set sequence; the presentation is randomized and the time in between stimuli can vary. efMRI attempts to model the change in fMRI signal in response to neural events associated with behavioral trials. According to D'Esposito, \\"event-related fMRI has the potential to address a number of cognitive psychology questions with a degree of inferential and statistical power not previously available.\\"D'Esposito Each trial can be composed of one experimentally controlled (such as the presentation of a word or picture) or a participant mediated \\"event\\" (such as a motor response). Within each trial, there are a number of events such as the presentation of a stimulus, delay period, and response. If the experiment is properly set up and the different events are timed correctly, efMRI allows a person to observe the differences in neural activity associated with each event. History Positron Emission Tomography (PET), was the most frequently used brain mapping technique before the development of fMRI. There are a number of advantages that are presented in comparison to PET. According to D‚ÄôEsposito, they include that fMRI ‚Äúdoes not require an injection of radioisotope into participants and is otherwise noninvasive, has better spatial resolution, and has better temporal resolution.\\" The first MRI studies employed the use of ‚Äúexogenous paramagnetic tracers to map changes in cerebral blood volume‚Äù,Dale which allowed for the assessment of brain activity over several minutes. This changed with two advancements to MRI, the rapidness of MRI techniques were increased to 1.5 Tesla by the end of the 1980s, which provided a 2-d image. Next, endogenous contrast mechanisms were discovered by Detre, Koretsky, and colleagues was based on the net longitudinal magnetization within an organ, and a ‚Äúsecond based on changes in the magnetic susceptibility induced by changing net tissue deoxyhemoglobin content‚Äù,Buckner which has been labeled BOLD contrast by Siege Ogawa. These discoveries served as inspiration for future brain mapping advancements. This allowed researchers to develop more complex types of experiments, going beyond observing the effects of single types of trials. When fMRI was developed one of its major limitations was the inability to randomize trials, but the event related fMRI fixed this problem. Cognitive subtraction was also an issue, which tried to correlate cognitive-behavioral differences between tasks with brain activity by pairing two tasks that are assumed to be matched perfectly for every sensory, motor, and cognitive process except the one of interest. Next, a push for the improvement of temporal resolution of fMRI studies led to the development of event-related designs, which according to Peterson, was inherited from ERP research in electrophysiology, but it was discovered that this averaging did not apply very well to the hemodynamic response because the response from trials could overlap. As a result, random jittering of the events was applied, which meant that the time repetition was varied and randomized for the trials in order to ensure that the activation signals did not overlap. Hemodynamic response In order to function, neurons require energy which is supplied by blood flow. Although it is not completely understood, the hemodynamic response has been correlated with neuronal activity, that is, as the activity level increases, the amount of blood used by neurons increases. This response takes several seconds to completely develop. Accordingly, fMRI has limited temporal resolution. The hemodynamic response is the basis for the BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast in fMRI.Buckner, R. The hemodynamic response occurs within seconds of the presented stimuli, but it is essential to space out the events in order to ensure that the response being measured is from the event that was presented and not from a prior event. Presenting stimuli in a more rapid sequence allows experimenters to run more trials and gather more data, but this is limited by the slow course of hemodynamic response, which generally must be allowed to return baseline before the presentation of another stimulus. According to Burock ‚Äúas the presentation rate increases in the random event related design, the variance in the signal increases thereby increasing the transient information and ability to estimate the underlying hemodynamic response‚Äù. Rapid event-related efMRI In a typical efMRI, after every trial the hemodynamic response is allowed to return to baseline. In rapid event-related fMRI, trials are randomized and the HRF is deconvolved afterwards. In order for this to be possible, every possible combination of trial sequences must be used and the inter-trial intervals jittered so that the time in between trials is not always the same. Advantages of efMRI # Ability to randomize and mix different types of events, which ensures that one event isn‚Äôt influenced by others and not affected by the cognitive state of an individual, doesn‚Äôt allow for predictability of events. # Events can be organized into categories after the experiment based on the subjects behavior # The occurrence of events can be defined by the subject # Sometimes the blocked event design cannot be applied to an event. # Treating stimuli, even when blocked, as separate events can potentially result in a more accurate model. # Rare events can be measured. Chee argues that event related designs provide a number of advantages in language-related tasks, including the ability to separate correct and incorrect responses, and show task dependent variations in temporal response profiles.Chee Disadvantages of efMRI # More complex design and analysis. # Need to increase the number of trials because the MR signal is small. # Some events are better blocked. # Timing issues: sampling (fix: random jitter, varying the timing of the presentation of the stimuli, allows for a mean hemodynamic response to be calculated at the end). # Blocked designs have higher statistical power. # Easier to identify artifacts arising from non-physiologic signal fluctuations.,. Statistical analysis In fMRI data, it is assumed that there is a linear relationship between neural stimulation and the BOLD response. The use of GLMs allows for the development of a mean to represent the mean hemodynamic response within the participants. Statistical Parametric Mapping is used to produce a design matrix, which includes all of the different response shapes produced during the event.

Big Cedar was an arm or branch of the Little Cedar Grove Baptist Church, which was the first church constituted in the Whitewater River Valley, by Elder William Tyner, who had come with colony from Virginia about 1797. The Baptist church on Big Cedar in the state of Indiana, Franklin county and Springfield Township, with 13 members, was constituted Saturday Sept. 13, 1817 and assumed the title of Big Cedar Grove Church. In May 1819 they decided to build a meeting house. Job Stout and William Hetrick each deeded one acre of land for the church and burying ground. The first meetings of this church were held at the home of Job and Rhoda Stout (daughter of Abner Howell). The first church was a log cabin, in 1824 they agreed to finish the walls with wood and clay. In May 1835 they began talking of a better church building and decided to make it of brick. Bricks were made near the site. The money for it was raised by subscription. They bought a stove in October, and in December 1837 the first service was held in this building. According to the records 214 different persons helped pay for the church. A division occurred in the membership from 1869 to 1871 on the mission subject. In April 1870 the members found the church doors barred, bolted, and locked and held their meetings in the church yard and grove until November 1870 when they met at the residence of Deacon Samuel Goudie (son of James B. Goudie Jr.) and did so for the next seven meetings. The matter went to court, where a settlement was made dividing the time between the two factions. One group was given the first and third Sundays, the other group meeting the second and fourth Sundays. Each faction was to pay half the expenses of keeping the church in repair. Each was to furnish their own wood for fuel and lights. The history of the burying ground as they always called it, was all the time connected with the business of the church. It is not known sure who was first buried here, for so many graves have no mark, but the oldest inscription on a tombstone is of John Hetrick, a child who died in 1820. The Big Cedar Grove Cemetery Association was formed April 1899. In 1901 the church transferred all her interest in the graveyard to that association. This church was disbanded, September 12, 1959. The cemetery is still active today and the church building is now maintained by the Big Cedar Cemetery Association.

It is used as a pedestrian crossing over the South Yuba River. The bridge was built in 1862 by David John Wood. Its lumber came from Plum Valley in Sierra County, California. The bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in 1972 and pedestrian traffic in 2011 due to deferred maintenance and \\"structural problems\\".Historic Bridgeport Bridge to close - Appeal-Democrat On June 20, 2014, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed budget legislation that included $1.3 million for the bridge's restoration. The work is slated to be done in two phases‚Äînear-term stabilization followed by restoration. Restoration may not begin until 2018. The Bridgeport Covered Bridge has the longest clear single span of any surviving wooden covered bridge in the world.The Nevada County, California website that claims Bridgeport Covered Bridge has a longer span than the Old Blenheim Bridge had, also claims it is a National Historic Landmark. While the National Historic Landmark search system does not report on the existence of this bridge as a National Historic Landmark. It is a California Historical Landmark and listed at the National Register of Historic Places. Historic landmark The bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and it is also a California Registered Historical Landmark No. 390. There are four plaques at the site.Comstock, David A. and Zimmerman, Bernard, Exploring Nevada County (2017 electronic edition} #4. The State Historical Landmark plaque was placed in 1964. The landmark was rededicated in 2014. The inscription on the current plaque reads: > \\"Built in 1862 by David J. Wood with lumber from his mill in Sierra County. > The covered bridge was part of the Virginia Turnpike Company toll road that > served the northern mines and the Nevada Comstock Lode. The associated ranch > and resources for rest and repair provided a necessary lifeline across the > Sierra Nevada. Utilizing a unique combination truss and arch construction, > Bridgeport Covered Bridge is one of the oldest housed spans in the western > United States and the longest single span wooden covered bridge in the > world.\\" The bridge was an important link in a freight-hauling route that stretched from the San Francisco Bay to Virginia City, Nevada and points beyond after the discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859 sparked a mining boom in Nevada. Steamboats carried freight from the San Francisco Bay up the Sacramento River to Marysville, where it was loaded onto wagons for the trip across the Sierra Nevada via the Virginia Turnpike, and Henness Pass Road. The route across the bridge was ultimately eclipsed by the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad as far as Reno in 1868 via Donner Pass, but it continued to serve nearby communities in the foothills until improved roads and bridges on other routes drew away most of the traffic. Longest span A report by the U.S. Department of the Interior states that the Bridgeport Covered Bridge ( No. CA-41) has clear spans of on one side and on the other, while Old Blenheim Bridge ( No. NY-331) had a documented clear span of in the middle (1936 drawings). With the 2011 destruction of the Old Blenheim Bridge, the Bridgeport Covered Bridge is the undisputed longest-span wooden covered bridge still surviving. Historically, the longest single-span covered bridge on record was Pennsylvania's McCall's Ferry Bridge with a claimed clear span of (built 1814‚Äì15, destroyed by ice jam 1817).

In 1960, for his work on television, ZaBach was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6505 Hollywood Blvd. Biography ZaBach was born in Chicago, the son and only child of Florian ZaBach Sr., who played clarinet with the Vienna Philharmonic, and Anna Morganfort-ZaBach. He studied music and learned to play the violin with his father and at the Chicago Cosmopolitan Conservatory of Music. At the age of 12 he debuted with the Chicago Symphony orchestra playing the Mendelssohn concerto. He went to the Prague Conservatory in Czechoslovakia to further his violin studies. When he returned to the United States, he joined the music staff of Chicago's NBC and WGN radio stations. After years in the Army Medical Corps as a private and a corporal, he resumed his musical career in Washington, D.C. at the Mayflower Hotel. Television's Arthur Godfrey discovered him there, and ZaBach appeared on Godfrey's show several times. He also appeared on most of the television shows emanating from New York at the time: Ed Sullivan, Milton Berle, Ken Murray, Red Skelton, Steve Allen, Jack Paar and 25 appearances on The Tonight Show. For over a year he performed five one-hour shows daily, seven days a week as master of ceremonies, orchestra conductor and violin soloist on the stage of Strand Theatre on Broadway. ZaBach then moved to Hollywood, where he filmed the \\"Florian ZaBach\\" show, a weekly half-hour television series that was syndicated nationwide in more than 90 markets and in major cities throughout the world. He also appeared with major symphony orchestras as soloist and conductor on their pops concerts in the United States and in London, Vienna, Genoa, Venice, Australia and Beijing, among other concert halls. ZaBach recorded many albums for Mercury and Decca using his 1732 Guarnerius del Gesu violin, created in Cremona, Italy. including million-seller \\"The Hot Canary\\" on Decca in 1951 and a minor hit \\"When The White Lilacs Bloom Again' on Mercury in 1956.

Classic Veracruz culture (or Gulf Coast Classic culture) refers to a cultural area in the north and central areas of the present-day Mexican state of Veracruz, a culture that existed from roughly 100 to 1000 CE, or during the Classic era.Various authors give various end-points, e.g. Noble (p. 645) gives 250 CE to 900 CE while others vaguely refer to the MesoamericanClassic era, which itself spans different timeframes for different regions. El Tajin was the major center of Classic Veracruz culture; other notable settlements include Higueras, Zapotal, Cerro de las Mesas, Nopiloa, and Remojadas, the latter two important ceramics centers. The culture spanned the Gulf Coast between the P√°nuco River on the north and the Papaloapan River on the south. The Classic Veracruz culture is sometimes associated with the Totonacs, who were occupying this territory at the time of the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. However, there is little or no evidence that the Totonacs were the originators of the Classic era culture.Coe, p. 115, who says \\"The tribal name 'Totonac' has often been inappropriately applied . . .\\" and Kubler, p. 137, who says \\"It is less misleading to refer to the region by chronological terms - Classic Veracruz and post-Classic - than by ethno-historical names [Totonac] of doubtful relevance.\\" Social structure Burials, monumental sculpture, relief carvings, and the distribution of architecture within the regional centers all point to a stratification of Classic Veracruz society, including the presence of an elite rank as well as craft specialization. Elite hereditary rulers held sway over these small- to medium-sized regional centers, none over 2000 km¬≤, maintaining their rule through political and religious control of far-flung trade networks and legitimizing it through typical Mesoamerican rites such as bloodletting, human sacrifice, warfare, and use of exotic goods.Pool, et al., p. 207. Much or most of the population, however, lived in isolated homesteads, hamlets, or villages.Pool, p. 205. Like the Epi-Olmec and Olmec cultures before it, Classic Veracruz culture was based on swidden, or slash-and-burn, agriculture, with maize an important component of the diet, supplemented with domestic dog, wild deer and other mammals, and fish and shellfish. Cotton was also an important crop.Pool, p. 212. Religion Little is known concerning Classic Veracruz religion and inferences have to be made from better-known Mesoamerican religions such as those of the Aztec, Mixtec, and Maya. Only some of the many deity figures known from these religions have been recognized with any certainty. Large ceramic figures show a stooped, very old man representing the Mesoamerican fire god. Equally large ceramic statues show female earth goddesses with snake girdles connected to the site of El Zapotal. Based on their closed eyes and wide open mouths, and also on the nearby shrine of a death god and on the surrounding burials, the latter have been identified as deified women who died in child birth, more or less corresponding to the much later Aztec cihuateteo ('female gods') also known from the Codex Borgia.Diehl Otherwise similar ceramic statues of earth goddesses, however, standing or seated, do not have dead faces and should therefore not be compared to the Aztec cihuateteo. The ball court reliefs of El Tajin prominently depict a death god, a rain god and what may be a sun god and are important for their narrative quality perhaps related to the origin of pulque. Hachas commonly show the head of an aged god probably connected to earth and water. An earth monster was likely inherited from the Olmecs.Pool, et al., p. 208. Many ceremonially clad ceramic figurines have been found that testify to the importance of public ritual, while the ceramic figurines of persons with smiling and laughing faces (the so-called sonrientes) seem to represent ritual performers; they may point to a cult similar to that of the much later Aztec deity Xochipilli. However, hardly anything is known about the interrelations of the deities mentioned above, their role in the religious feasts, and the possible connection of these feasts to the calendar (like the monthly feasts of the Aztec and Maya). Mesoamerican ballgame The Classic Veracruz culture was seemingly obsessed with the ballgame.Davies (p. 123) who reports that El Tajin's \\"inhabitants seem to have been obsessed by the game\\" and Coe (p. 118) who states that \\"the inhabitants of El Tajin were obsessed with the ballgame, human sacrifice, and death\\". Every cultural center had at least one ballcourt, while up to 18 ballcourts have been found at El Tajin.Metropolitan Museum of Art \\"Palma with Skeletal Head Figure (Mexico, Veracruz) (1978.412.16)\\" cites 17, while Day, p. 75, reports 18. Other researchers report lower numbers of ballcourts. The differences may be accounted for continuing discovery of additional ballcourts. It was during Late Classic here in north-central Veracruz that the ballgame reached its height.See Wilkerson (p. 48), who says \\"The ballgame ritual greatly intensitifes during this [Classic Veracruz] period, reaching a peak that may not have been equaled anywhere else in Mesoamerica.\\". The ballgame rituals appear throughout Classic Veracruz monumental art. The walls of largest ballcourt, the East Ballcourt at El Tajin are lined with carved murals showing human sacrifice in the context of the ballgame (see photo above).Kampen (1978) p. 116. The culmination of these murals is a tableau showing the rain god, who pierces his penis (an act of bloodletting) to replenish a vat of the alcoholic, ritual drink pulque, the apparent desired end result of the ballgame ritual sacrifice.Wilkerson, p. 65. A defining characteristic of the Classic Veracruz culture is the presence of stone ballgame gear: yokes, hachas, and palmas. Yokes are U-shaped stones worn about the waist of a ballplayer, while the hachas and palmas sit upon the yoke. Palmas were fitted to the front of a yoke and were elongated sculptures often of effigies of birds‚Äîlike turkeys‚Äîor realistic scenes. Hachas were thin stone heads that were markers that were typically placed in the court to score the game, but could be worn on the yoke. Archaeologists generally suppose that the stone yokes are ritual versions of leather, cotton, and/or wood yokes, although no such perishable artifacts have yet been unearthed. While the yokes and hachas have been found from Teotihuacan to Guatemala, the palmas seem peculiar to what is today northern Veracruz. Art The art of Classic Veracruz is rendered with extensive and convoluted banded scrolls that can be seen both on monumental architecture and on portable art, including ceramics and even carved bones. At least one researcher has suggested that the heads and other features formed by the scrolls are a Classic Veracruz form of pictographic writing.See Kampen-O'Riley, p. 299. This scrollwork may have grown out of similar styles found in Chiapa de Corzo and Kaminaljuyu.Kubler, p. 141. In addition to the scrollwork, the architecture is known for its remarkable ornamentation, such as that seen on the Pyramid of Niches at El Tajin. This ornamentation produces dramatic contrasts of light and shadow, what art historian George Kubler called a \\"bold chiaroscuro\\".Kubler, p. 139. While Classic Veracruz culture shows influences from Teotihuacan and the Maya,See Bruhns, who describes the culture as having an \\"international flavor\\", or Covarrubias, who mentions Teotihuacan influences, albeit minor influences, on p. 193. neither of these cultures are its direct antecedents. Instead, the seeds of this culture seems to have come at least in part from the Epi-Olmec culture centers, such as Cerro de las Mesas and La Mojarra.Wilkerson, p. 46-47. =Ceramics= Until the early 1950s, the Classic Veracruz ceramics were few, little understood, and generally without provenance. Since then, the recovery of thousands of figurines and pottery pieces from sites such as Remojadas, Los Cerros, Dicha Tuerta, and Tenenexpan, some initially by looters, has expanded our understanding and filled many museum shelves.Medellin Zenil. See also Covarrubias, p. 191. Artist and art historian Miguel Covarrubias described Classic Veracruz ceramics as \\"powerful and expressive, endowed with a charm and sensibility unprecedented in other, more formal cultures\\".Covarrubias, p. 191. Remojadas style figurines, perhaps the most easily recognizable, are usually hand-modeled, and often adorned with appliqu√©s. Of particular note are the Sonrientes (smiling faces) figurines, with triangular-shaped heads and outstretched arms. Nopiloa figurines are usually less ornate, without appliqu√©s, and often molded.Covarrubias, p. 191. The Classic Veracruz culture produced some of the few wheeled Mesoamerican figurines and is also noted for the use of bitumen for highlighting.

The power stationed operated from 11 March 1927 until March 1976. Description The Cockle Creek power station was built by Caledonian Collieries Limited between 1925 and 1927 to use low grade coal to provide power to Caledonian Collieries mines and the surrounding townships in both the Lake Macquarie and Cessnock areas. A weir at Barnsley along Cockle Creek was constructed to supply cooling water for the power station. The initial plant installed at the power station consisted of two Brown Boveri 5 MW turbo alternators with two Babock & Wilcox cross type marine water tube boilers. The two water tube boilers ran at a steam pressure of with a capacity of of steam per hour each and were each fed by two Babock & Wilcox chain grate stokers. The power station building was constructed of brick except for one end wall which was clad in galvanised sheeting to allow for future expansion. By 1936 with an increase in load requiring extra steam generating plant, a third boiler was ordered. This boiler was also built by Babcock & Wilcox and was a single drum cross type water tube boiler and ran at a steam pressure of with a capacity of of steam per hour and was fed by a single chain grate stoker. By 1938 the load on the power station had increased to the stage where a third generator set was required. An order was placed with British-Thomson Houston for a 3.222 MW turbo alternator which was then numbered No.3 and was placed into service in March 1939. Due to a failure at the Department of Railways New South Wales power station at Zaara Street in Newcastle in July 1941 the Department of Railways constructed a transmission line to join with the overland transmission line to Cessnock to allow Cockle Creek to supply power to the Railway's transmission grid. With increased demand for power during the 1950s a fourth boiler was ordered. This boiler was also built by Babcock & Wilcox and was a bi-drum radiant type water tube boiler and ran at a steam pressure of with a capacity of of steam per hour and was fed by a single Babcock \\"Detroit\\" Rotograte stocker. At its peak the power station had a capacity of 13.222 MW and provided electricity to 17 mines and to Teralba, Barnsley, Estelville, Wakefield, West Wallsend, Killingworth and Cessnock. In May 1960 Caledonian Collieries amalgamated with J & A Brown and Abermain Seaham Collieries Ltd, with the new company being named Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. Soon afterwards a connection with the J & A Brown Richmond Main to Hexham transmission line was made to interconnect the output of the two power stations. The power station was closed in March 1976 and was soon demolished.

It was the sixth and final company to start during the horse car era. It operated on a loop, or \\"belt,\\" around downtown and the National Mall. For that reason, and because of its long name, it was known colloquially as the Belt Railway. It changed its name to the Belt Railway in 1893. It expanded north and south on 11th street west to the boundaries of the city. In 1896 it attempted to use compressed air motors instead of electricity, a decision that sent them into receivership. In 1898, the company was purchased by the Anacostia and Potomac River Railroad and the company ceased to exist. Map of the Washington, D.C. Streetcar System at the end of the Horse Car era in 1888 Origins The Capitol, North O Street and South Washington Railway Company was the last streetcar company to begin operations during Washington's horsecar era. It was incorporated on March 3, 1875, and began operation later that year. Its circular route went from the Capitol along 1st Street SW; south of the Mall on Maryland and Virginia Avenues SW; north on 12th Street SW/NW, the old Ohio Avenue NW (now obliterated by Federal Triangle) and 14th Street NW to O Street NW; east on O Street NW for ten blocks; and then south on 4th Street NW, G Street NW and 1st Street NW. Expansion and name change The Capitol, North O Street and South Washington went through several changes after its initial startup. A P Street NW track was added in 1876 for westbound cars, leaving O Street NW for eastbound traffic. In 1881, the 11th street line was extended north to Boundary Street and south to Water Street SW and along that street to the Arsenal. At the same time, tracks were rerouted across the Mall. The last change came on February 18, 1893, when it changed its name to the Belt Railway Company. Switch to electricity In 1896 Congress directed the Belt Railway to try out compressed air motors, just as it had the Eckington and Soldier's Home. The compressed air motors were a failure and in 1899 the company's cars were equipped with the standard underground power system. Bankruptcy and purchase As a result of the compressed air motor fiasco, the company went into receivership. Shortly thereafter, on June 24, 1898, the Anacostia and Potomac River purchased the Belt Railway.  Notes  Street railways in Washington, D.C.

Its top speed is . The official press release stated that only 20 vehicles would be sold to the public, with one additional car (marked as 00/20) produced for the Lamborghini museum. Each car is stamped with its number in the sequence of 35 between the driver's and passenger's seats. While the exterior is new, almost all the mechanical elements, including the engine, are sourced directly from the Murci√©lago LP640. According to the official press release, the Revent√≥n's exterior styling was inspired by \\"the fastest airplanes\\". Name The car is named after a fighting bull, in line with Lamborghini tradition. The bull, raised by Don Heriberto Rodriguez, was best known for killing famed Mexican bullfighter Felix Guzman in 1943.Lamborghini Revent√≥n, Omni Auto magazine, 11 September 2007 (in Italian) Revent√≥n means \\"small explosion\\" or \\"burst\\" in Spanish, when used as a noun. In the vernacular, it is also used to define a very large party or a night in town. In automotive terms, it means \\"blowout or flat tire\\" when used as a noun.Harper-Collins Spanish Dictionary, 3rd ed., p. 640 When it was used as the name of a bull, however, it was intended to be interpreted as an adjective, a quality or property of that bull in particular. In this last sense, revent√≥n means \\"he who seems to be about to burst\\". Or, in the case of a flower (a carnation, un clavel revent√≥n) in its maximum point, of luxuriance or a mouth (una boca reventona), for its beauty and fullness. Overview Lamborghini Revent√≥n =Interior= The instrument panel in the Revent√≥n consists of three TFT liquid crystal displays (LCDs) with two different display modes. The instruments are housed in a structure milled from a solid aluminum block, protected by a carbon-fiber casing. The car's instrumentation includes a \\"g-force-meter\\" which displays the magnitude and direction of the g-forces acting upon the car. The seats of the Revent√≥n are made from black leather and brown Alcantara. =Exterior= The Revent√≥n features an all-new carbon-fiber exterior. All cars have the same exterior color, described as \\"mid opaque grey without the usual shine.\\" It is the first Lamborghini automobile to incorporate daytime running lamps into the headlamps. Seven light-emitting diodes (LED) at each headlamp flank the bi-xenon main beam and stay lit whenever the car is in motion. Due to the high temperatures in the rear lower part of the car, special heatproof LED is used for the indicator and hazard lights, stoplights, and rear lights with a triple arrow optical effect. The Reventon's exterior design created the basis for the company's current flagship, the Aventador. The active rear wing and the active air intakes integrated into the car's shoulders are electronically controlled, deploying automatically only at high speeds in an effort to maximize both aerodynamic and cooling efficiency. =Power plant= The engine is the same taken from the Murci√©lago LP640 V12 now upgraded to at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 6,000 rpm. The car accelerates from 0- in 3.4 seconds and can attain a maximum speed of over . Sales Of the original 20 coupes, 10 were delivered to the United States, seven to Europe, one to Canada, and two to Asia. One of them is in the possession of the Head of Chechenyan Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. Revent√≥n Roadster The Revent√≥n Roadster A roadster version of the vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The car would use the engine from the Murci√©lago LP 670‚Äì4 Super Veloce. In June 2009, Autocar published a report saying that potential buyers have been shown the car, although a Lamborghini spokesman told the publication that reports of the car were \\"just speculation\\". Production was set for a run of 15 units, with a MSRP of ‚Ç¨1,100,000. The actual price, however, increased twofold to around US$2,100,000, due to high demand. The Revent√≥n Roadster has a slightly lower top speed than the Revent√≥n despite having more power, at , and takes 3.4 seconds to reach . This is due to the chassis reinforcing components to compensate for the loss of the roof. The car also features deployable roll hoops which quickly extend to protect the car's occupants in the event of a rollover.

It was one of the first of several historic California gold rush mining camps along the San Juan Ridge. The name was literal as the town grew around a mule corral built by the first settler in the area, a Frenchman, in 1849. It had a post office during the period of 1859 through 1945. Few original structures remain besides an old Wells Fargo Bank building.  Location  Based on roads and trails used during its time, French Corral was located between the small towns of Rough & Ready and North San Juan. On a present-day map, French Corral is located in the extreme northwest corner of Nevada County, California. Originally, French Corral was part of nearby Bridgeport Township, the third locality in the county in terms of population and wealth during the mining years. French Corral is part of a thermal belt that runs from the town site to the Bear River along the lower foothills of the western part of Nevada County. This allowed citrus crops to be successfully grown in the area from the 1870s well into the 1920s. Due to the accommodating soil and climate, early French settlers of the area planted vineyards and produced local wines.  Founding  French Corral's name is self-descriptive in that in 1849 a Frenchman living on Frenchman's Bar on the Yuba River built a mule corral on the site that would later become the town. At about the same time, a Mr. Galloway established a trading post near by. Originally in a tent, it was upgraded to a log building. In 1851 the town showed up as Frenchmans Couill on a Milleson & Adams map, and by 1857 the town was shown as French Corral on Goddard's map. At some point during this timeframe, the locals tried to rename the town Carrolton, but the new name never stuck and it remained French Corral. Mining and, to a lesser extent, agriculture both drove the boom in French Corral. By the 1850s it was an important town between the growing gold-rush hubs of Grass Valley and Nevada City, and rural North San Juan.  History  The town thrived for several decades, by the early 1850s French Corral had a population of 300-400 residents. In 1852 a Post Office was established and by 1859 a horse express to the nearby town of North San Juan was introduced. Supported by the continuing mining opportunities, by the 1880s there were two hotels, one store, a saloon, a bakery, four blacksmiths, two carpenters, a physician, and many homes in French Corral. Helping to continue the vibrancy of the town was a stage line from North San Juan to Marysville in Yuba County that routed through French Corral. By mid 1853 the town boasted approximately 70 homes. Unfortunately, within a short time fire destroyed 50 of them. Fire would continue to plague the town with destruction and rebuilding becoming a regular part of life for the residents. Beginning in 1855, the male citizens of French Corral consistently cast votes in national and state elections and volunteered for the Bridgeport Guards, a protective organization. During the Civil War, the town contributed $300 to the ‚Äúsanitary fund‚Äù for the Union Army. Founded, and sustained to a great extent by individuals from France or of French ancestry, the town retained a Gallic influence, becoming a major grape-growing region in Nevada County. Many citizens maintained contact with their mother country. For example, in 1870, the town collected and donated $192 to the French victims of the Franco-Prussian War. As was unfortunately commonplace in the surrounding mining towns, the residents of French Corral drove out the local Chinese residents and burned down may of their homes in 1867. A trial later determined that one individual was the ‚Äúinstigator,‚Äù but most accomplices went unpunished.  Mining  French Corral's current condition contradicts its prolific past. Having \\"resounded to the tread of the prospector,\\" the town enjoyed both a placer boom and a hydraulic mining boom. The area existed as a successful mining region from 1849 well into the 1800s. Ravine mining began in the area in 1849, with surface diggings discovered around 1851. More sophisticated mining practices started in early 1852, with the building of a ditch from Shady Creek by the Messrs, Twist, Wadsworth, Williams, Spurry, and the Eddy brothers. Another Shady Creek ditch was built in 1853, brought in by the Grizzly Water Company and principally owned by Charles Marsh and W.M. Stewart. Several fires damaged the facilities, but profitable mining continued, with more ditches and deeper tunnels being built throughout the 1850s. The gold mined in the 1850s in the French Corral area was estimated in the millions of dollars. As hydraulic mining took over, several large mines were established near French Corral, including the Manzanita Mine operated by the Milton Company. By 1880, the company had 160 men on the payroll. Several men became wealthy through these mining practices. Those men included A.H. Eddy, the eventual owner of the National Exchange Hotel in Nevada City, W.G. Fenton, M.L. Marsh, and Jean Villian. Hydraulic mining lasted until the 1884 prohibition of discharging mining debris into the Yuba River. In 1894, however, the U.S. Debris Commission granted limited hydraulic mining to the French Corral region. Interestingly, diamonds of notable size and brilliance were also found in French Corral. They was said that \\"bigger and better diamonds have been found at French Corral, in Nevada County, than in any other place in California.\\"  First Long-Distance Phone Line  The world's first long-distance telephone line was built in 1877 by the Ridge Telephone Company. It connected French Corral with French Lake, approximately 60 miles away, and it was operated by the Milton Mining Company. This historic accomplishment is memorialized by California State Historic Marker #247 near the center of the physical remains of French Corral on Pleasant Valley Road. Geography French Corral is located at , and the elevation is above sea level. =Climate= According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, French Corral has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csa\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for French Corral, California Demographics In 1880, the population was 527.

EIA July 24, 2007 Additionally, WOC manages oil for several companies through its production lines running from the Sirte Basin to Es-Sider terminal. Some of these companies include Wintershall, Total S.A. and Zuietina. WOC is owned by the National Oil Corporation (NOC) in a joint venture with ConocoPhillips, Marathon and Hess Corp. History WOC was established in 1956 and its first oil discovery was made in 1959, in Dahra field. In 1962, WOC began pumping oil to a terminal operated by Conoco, Amerada Hess and Marathon. In 1968, Shell joined the consortium, purchasing shares from Amerada Hess. In 1973, after the Al-Fatah Revolution, company shares were split between these companies (49%) and NOC (51%). In 1974, Shell declined to sign this agreement and NOC bought their shares, making the split 59-41%. This resulted in the formation of Oasis Oil Company. In 1986, former U.S. President Ronald Reagan issued an Executive Order to all U.S. oil companies to withdraw from Libya. This led to an agreement between NOC and the U.S. oil companies to freeze previous agreements for three years, pending review. However, once economic sanctions were established they never returned. After this, NOC became the sole owner of WOC. In 2002, the previous parties involved re-established communications with NOC and WOC.United World Interview: Dergham On 20 September 2004, President George W.

It consists of pieces of soft baked dough sprinkled with cinnamon. It is often served at fairs and festivals. Name Monkey bread having been pulled apart with a fork The origin of the term \\"monkey bread\\" comes from the pastry being a finger food; the consumer would pick apart the bread as a monkey would. Other names for the bread include Christmas morning delights, monkey puzzle bread, monkey brains, sticky bread, Hungarian coffee cake, golden dumpling coffee cake, pinch-me cake, pluck-it cake, bubble loaf and funky bread. Origins What most people know as monkey bread today in the United States is actually the Hungarian dessert arany galuska (\\"golden dumpling\\"). Dating back to the 1880s in Hungarian literature, Hungarian immigrants brought this dish with them when they immigrated to America and began introducing it into the country's food landscape when Hungarian and Hungarian Jewish bakeries began selling it in the mid-twentieth century. In 1972, a cookbook published by Betty Crocker included a recipe for arany galuska, which they referred to as \\"Hungarian Coffee Cake\\". As it became more popular in America, arany galuska came to be confused with monkey bread in which the balls of dough are not dipped in cinnamon and sugar but only in butter. \\"Monkey bread\\" soon became the more common name for this Hungarian Jewish dessert. Recipes for the bread first appeared in American women's magazines and community cookbooks in the 1950s, but the dish is still virtually unknown outside the United States. Preparation The bread is made with pieces of sweet yeast dough (often frozen), which are baked in a cake pan at high heat after first being individually covered in melted butter, cinnamon, sugar, and chopped pecans. It is traditionally served hot so that the baked segments can be easily torn away with the fingers and eaten by hand.

Early years Born in Glasgow, Scotland and an operative in the boot trade. He enjoyed the poetry of Robert Burns and was member of the Burns Club. On arriving in Wellington McLaren became involved in the Union movement seeking to improve the lot of lower paid workers. McLaren was Secretary of the Wellington Wharf Labourers Union in New Zealand.Wellington: Biography of a city by Redmer Yska (Reed, Auckland, 2006) pages 98f He was considered a moderate socialist. He was a member of the Wellington City Council for 11 years from 1901 to 1912 and was elected Mayor of Wellington from 1912 to 1913. McLaren was also member of the Hospital Board for 12 years. During World War I McLaren was appointed to the Military Service Board, and also served on the War Relief Association from its inception in 1914. At the end of the war he was appointed to the Influenza Epidemic Commission. Member of Parliament McLaren was one of nine candidates who contested the three-member electorate in the ; he came last with 7% of the vote. In the , McLaren stood in the electorate for the Independent Political Labour League (IPLL). Two Liberal candidates received similar votes and both were eliminated in the first ballot. This left McLaren face a conservative candidate, Arthur Richmond Atkinson, in the second ballot, and with many liberal voters transferring their allegiance to McLaren, he became the only candidate of the IPLL who was ever elected to the House of Representatives. McLaren attended the Liberal Party's caucus, but maintained his independence in the house, voting both with and against them. In 1911 he was defeated by the conservative candidate, Alfred Newman, by 65 votes. At the 1914 contest, McLaren was again unsuccessful, this time by 48 votes. McLaren became estranged from the Labour Party during World War I. He was concerned about the rise of militant elements within the party. Later on, McLaren organised the wartime Welfare League and through this was associated with Edward Kellett. He died on 3 November 1939 at Wellington Public Hospital. He was survived by his wife and daughter who were living in London.

Her book Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern outlines the scope of a materialist feminism, proposing a transdisciplinary analysis of the embodied roots of capitalist patriarchal globalisation. The book is one of the earliest eco-socialist statements. Ariel Salleh (2017) Ecofeminism as Politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern. 2nd edn. London: ZED Publishings. Salleh traces the effects of what she sees as the \\"originary contradiction\\": economic resourcing of labour (women's bodies in the first instance) \\"as nature\\" and the eurocentric ideology of \\"humanity v nature\\" used to justify that systemic exploitation. Ariel Salleh (2017) Ecofeminism as politics: Nature, Marx and the Postmodern. 2nd edn. London: ZED Publishings. The failure to observe natures ‚Äòmetabolic value‚Äô and the inherent thought of production and exchange value are ignored by the radical left. The book contains a sharp critique of the patriarchal bias in both orthodox Marxist thought and in green politics.

Her critical studies of green thought, environmental ethics, and ecopolitics, run to some 100 articles and chapters. She lectures on ecofeminism internationally. Key concepts =Embodied materialism= Following Marx‚Äôs analysis, Salleh uses a dialectical methodology to extend the classic Marxist meaning of materialism to ‚Äúembodied materialism‚Äù through highlighting the hands-on lay knowledge of women, domestic providers, small farmers, and hunter-gatherers.

According to her theoretical developments and her experience as an activist, understanding the materiality of gender fractures allows for a confluence between different movements and a renewed integration of transformative perspectives.Canavan, G., Klarr, L., & Vu, R. (2010). Embodied materialism in action: an interview with Ariel Salleh. Polygraph, 22, 183. Her call for integrating eco-socialist and eco-feminist frameworks lays on the need to understand that historically, women¬¥s experiences and responses to different crises are different than those of men.Ariel Salleh (2017) Ecofeminism as politics: Nature, Marx and the postmodern. 2nd edn.

In her approach, \\"humans are nature in an embodied form\\". Salleh, A. (2005). Moving to an embodied materialism. Capitalism Nature Socialism, 16(2), 9-14. Embodied materialism is a theoretical tool for political practice, that analyses this materiality from a dialectical understanding of the daily life of women, peasants, and indigenous peoples in their particular relation to nature, in other words, the relations and knowledge of the meta-industrial class. =Meta-industrial labour= Meta- industrial labour is one of the key concepts in Ariel Salleh's work. The term refers to work outside of capitalist structures, done by care-givers, peasants, and indigenes, together forming the meta-industrial class. This meta-industrial class performs work that creates a metabolic value (opposite of metabolic rift, as defined by Karl Marx), by maintaining natural cycles. This opposes the current extractive industrial model, which creates ecological, embodied and social debt. Being marginalised by capitalist societies and politics, this class seems is often victimised or seen as something from the past. In reality, they manage to do what ‚Äòsustainability‚Äô is all about; meeting human needs while sustaining their natural environment.

First steps as a professional Possibly the most talented Portuguese basketball player of his generation, he played mostly for Benfica in Portugal - after being league champion with Estrelas da Avenida. With some lack of luck, he became a professional player right after the ending of the Golden Era of the basketball team of Benfica. In any case, he still won three trophies as young player, before leaving his favourite club to go play abroad, in the fantastic Serie A, for Adecco Milano. Career abroad At the age of 24, S√©rgio left his country and went to Adecco Milano to play in the Serie A. For the next season, he tried his luck in another Italian team, De Vizia Avellino, where he improved his game quality. After that season, he went to Spain, to play in the Liga ACB. He stayed 4 years in the ACB with CE Lleida B√†squet, team with which he reached the play-off for the title and also played in European competitions during its best moments.

The IBM arc system extends over 2800 km south from Tokyo, Japan, to beyond Guam, and includes the Izu Islands, Bonin Islands, and Mariana Islands; much more of the IBM arc system is submerged below sealevel. The IBM arc system lies along the eastern margin of the Philippine Sea Plate in the Western Pacific Ocean. It is the site of the deepest gash in Earth's solid surface, the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench. The IBM arc system formed as a result of subduction of the western Pacific plate. The IBM arc system now subducts mid-Jurassic to Early Cretaceous lithosphere, with younger lithosphere in the north and older lithosphere in the south, including the oldest (~170 million years old, or Ma) oceanic crust. Subduction rates vary from ~2 cm (1 inch) per year in the south to 6 cm (~2.5 inches) in the north. The volcanic islands that comprise these island arcs are thought to have been formed from the release of volatiles (steam from trapped water, and other gases) being released from the subducted plate, as it reached sufficient depth for the temperature to cause release of these materials. The associated trenches are formed as the oldest (most western) part of the Pacific plate crust increases in density with age, and because of this process finally reaches its lowest point just as it subducts under the crust to the west of it. The IBM arc system is an excellent example of an intra-oceanic convergent margin (IOCM). IOCMs are built on oceanic crust and contrast fundamentally with island arcs built on continental crust, such as Japan or the Andes. Because IOCM crust is thinner, denser, and more refractory than that beneath Andean-type margins, study of IOCM melts and fluids allows more confident assessment of mantle-to-crust fluxes and processes than is possible for Andean-type convergent margins. Because IOCMs are far removed from continents they are not affected by the large volume of alluvial and glacial sediments. The consequent thin sedimentary cover makes it much easier to study arc infrastructure and determine the mass and composition of subducted sediments. Active hydrothermal systems found on the submarine parts of IOCMs give us a chance to study how many of earth's important ore deposits formed. Boundaries of IBM Arc system Crust and lithosphere produced by the IBM arc system during its ~50 Ma history are found today as far west as the Kyushu- Palau Ridge (just east of the West Philippine Sea Basin), up to 1,000 km from the present IBM trench. The IBM arc system is the surficial expression of the operation of a subduction zone and this defines its vertical extent. The northern boundary of the IBM arc system follows the Nankai Trough northeastward and onto southern Honsh≈´, joining up with a complex system of thrusts that continue offshore eastward to the Japan Trench. The intersection of the IBM, Japan, and Sagami trenches at the Boso Triple Junction is the only trench-trench-trench triple junction on Earth. The IBM arc system is bounded on the east by a very deep trench, which ranges from almost 11 km deep in the Challenger Deep to less than 3 km where the Ogasawara Plateau enters the trench. The southern boundary is found where the IBM Trench meets the Kyushu- Palau Ridge near Belau. Thus defined, the IBM arc system spans over 25¬∞ of latitude, from 11¬∞N to 35¬∞20‚ÄôN Plate motions Cross-section through the shallow part of a subduction zone showing the relative positions of an active magmatic arc and back-arc basin, such as the southern part of the Izu-Bonin- Mariana Arc. The IBM arc system is part of the Philippine Sea Plate, at least to the first approximation. Although the IBM arc deforms internally ‚Äì and in fact in the south a small plate known as the Mariana Plate is separated from the Philippine Sea Plate by a spreading ridge in the Mariana Trough ‚Äì it is still useful to discuss approximate rates and directions of the Philippine Sea Plate with its lithospheric neighbors, because these define, to a first order, how rapidly and along what streamlines material is fed into the Subduction Factory. The Philippine Sea Plate (PH) has four neighboring plates: Pacific (PA), Eurasian (EU), North American (NA), and Caroline (CR). There is minor relative motion between PH and CR; furthermore, CR does not feed the IBM Subduction Factory, so it is not discussed further. The North American plate includes northern Japan, but relative motion between it and Eurasia is sufficiently small that relative motion between PH and EU explains the motion of interest. The Euler pole for PH-PA as inferred from the NUVEL-1A model for current plate motions lies about 8¬∞N 137.3¬∞E, near the southern end of the Philippine Sea Plate. PA rotates around this pole CCW ~1¬∞/Ma with respect to PH. This means that relative to the southernmost IBM, PA is moving NW and being subducted at about 20‚Äì30 mm/y, whereas relative to the northernmost IBM, PA is moving WNW and twice as fast. At the south end of IBM, there is almost no convergence between the Caroline Plate and the Philippine Sea Plate. The IBM arc is not experiencing trench ‚Äòroll-back‚Äô, that is, the migration of the oceanic trench towards the ocean. The trench is moving towards Eurasia, although a strongly extensional regime is maintained in the IBM arc system because of rapid PH-EU convergence. The nearly vertical orientation of the subducted plate beneath southern IBM exerts a strong ‚Äúsea-anchor‚Äù force that strongly resists its lateral motion. Back-arc basin spreading is thought to be due to the combined effects of the sea-anchor force and rapid PH-EU convergence . The obliquity of convergence between PA and the IBM arc system change markedly along the IBM arc system. Plate convergence inferred from earthquake slip vectors is nearly strike-slip in the northernmost Marianas, adjacent to and south of the northern terminus of the Mariana Trough, where the arc has been ‚Äòbowed-out‚Äô by back-arc basin opening, resulting in a trench which strikes approximately parallel to the convergence vectors. Convergence is strongly oblique for most of the Mariana Arc system but is more nearly orthogonal for the southernmost Marianas and most of the Izu-Bonin segments. noted that the arc-parallel slip rate in the forearc reaches a maximum of 30 mm/yr in the northern Marianas. According to McCaffrey, this is fast enough to have produced geologically significant effects, such as unroofing of high- grade metamorphic rocks, and provides one explanation for why the forearc in southern IBM is tectonically more active than that in northern IBM. Geologic history of the IBM Arc system Simplified tectonic history of the IBM arc system, viewed along E-W profiles. Red corresponds to regions of magmatic activity, blue is magmatically extinct. The evolution of the IBM arc system is among the best known of any convergent margin. Because IBM has always been an arc system under strong extension, its components encompass a broad area, from the Palau-Kyushu Ridge to the IBM trench (see first-right figure). In general, the oldest components are farthest west, but a complete record of evolution is preserved in the forearc. The IBM subduction zone began as part of a hemispheric-scale foundering of old, dense lithosphere in the Western Pacific . The beginning of true subduction localized the magmatic arc close to its present position, about 200 km away from the trench, and allowed the sub- forearc mantle to stabilize and cool. The arc stabilized until about 30 Ma, when it began to rift to form the Parece Vela Basin. Spreading also began in the northernmost part of the IBM arc about 25 Ma and propagated south to form the Shikoku Basin. Parece Vela and Shikoku basin spreading systems met about 20 Ma and the combined Parece Vela Basin-Shikioku Basin continued widening until about 15 Ma, ultimately producing Earth's largest back-arc basin. The arc was disrupted during rifting but began to build again as a distinct magmatic system once seafloor spreading began. Arc volcanism, especially explosive volcanism, waned during much of this episode, with a resurgence beginning about 20 Ma in the south and about 17 Ma in the north. Tephra from northern and southern IBM show that strong compositional differences observed for the modern arc have existed over most of the arc's history, with northern IBM being more depleted and southern IBM being relatively enriched. About 15 Ma, the northernmost IBM began to collide with Honsh≈´, probably as a result of new subduction along the Nankai Trough. A new episode of rifting to form the Mariana Trough back-arc basin began sometime after 10 Ma, with seafloor spreading beginning about 3‚Äì4 Ma. Because disruption of the arc is the first stage in forming any back-arc basin, the present Mariana arc volcanoes cannot be older than 3‚Äì4 Ma but the Izu-Bonin volcanoes could be as old as ~25 Ma. The Izu interarc rifts began to form about 2 Ma. IBM Arc system components Simplified bathymetric and topographic profile along the IBM magmatic arc Simplified bathymetric profiles across the IBM arc system, approximate locations shown in first figure. T indicates position of trench. The three segments of IBM (figure to right) do not correspond to variations on the incoming plate. Boundaries are defined by the Sofugan Tectonic Line (~29¬∞30‚ÄôN) separating the Izu and Bonin segments, and by the northern end of the Mariana Trough back-arc basin (~23¬∞N), that defines the boundary between the Bonin and Mariana segments. Forearc, active arc, and back arc are expressed differently on either side of these boundaries (see figure below). The forearc is that part of the arc system between the trench and the magmatic front of the arc and includes uplifted sectors of the forearc situated near the magmatic front, sometimes called the ‚Äòfrontal arc‚Äô. The IBM forearc from Guam to Japan is about 200 km wide. Uplifted portions of the forearc, composed of Eocene igneous basement surmounted by reef terraces of Eocene and younger age, produce the island chain from Guam north to Ferdinand de Medinilla in the Marianas. Similarly, the Bonin or Ogasawara Islands are mostly composed of Eocene igneous rocks. There is no accretionary prism associated with the IBM forearc or trench. The magmatic axis of the arc is well defined from Honsh≈´ to Guam. This ‚Äòmagmatic arc‚Äô is often submarine, with volcanoes built on a submarine platform that lies between 1 and 4 km water depth. Volcanic islands are common in the Izu segment, including O-shima, Hachijojima, and Miyakejima. The Izu segment farther south also contains several submarine felsic calderas. The Izu arc segment is also punctuated by inter-arc rifts. The Bonin segment to the south of the Sofugan Tectonic Line contains mostly submarine volcanoes and also some that rise slightly above sealevel, such as Nishino-shima. The Bonin segment is characterized by a deep basin, the Ogasawara Trough, between the magmatic arc and the Bonin Islands forearc uplift. The highest elevations in the IBM arc (not including the Izu Peninsula, where IBM comes onshore in Japan) are found in the southern part of the Bonin segment, where the extinct volcanic islands of Minami Iwo Jima and Kita Iwo Jima rise to almost 1000 m above sealevel. The bathymetric high associated with magmatic arc of the Izu and Bonin segments is often referred to as the Shichito Ridge in Japanese publications, and the Bonins are often referred to as the Ogasawara Islands. Volcanoes erupting lavas of unusual composition ‚Äì the shoshonitic province ‚Äì are found in the transition between the Bonin and Mariana arc segments, including Iwo Jima. The magmatic arc in the Marianas is submarine to the north of Uracas, south of which the Mariana arc includes volcanic islands (from north to south): Asuncion, Maug, Agrigan, Pagan, Alamagan, Guguan, Sarigan, and Anatahan. Mariana volcanoes again becomes submarine south of Anatahan. The back-arc regions of the three segments are quite different. The Izu segment is marked by several volcanic cross-chains which extend SW away from the magmatic front. The magmatically-starved Bonin arc segment has no back-arc basin, inter-arc rift, or rear-arc cross chains. The Mariana segment is characterized by an actively spreading back arc basin known as the Mariana Trough. The Mariana Trough shows marked variations along strike, with seafloor spreading south of 19¬∞15‚Äô and rifting farther north. The IBM arc system southwest of Guam is markedly different from the region to the north. The forearc region is very narrow and the intersection of backarc basin spreading axis with the arc magmatic systems is complex. =Behavior and composition of the Western Pacific plate= Everything on the Pacific plate that enters the IBM trench is subducted. The next section discusses some modifications of the lithosphere just prior to its descent and the age and composition of oceanic crust and sediments on the Pacific plate adjacent to the trench. In addition to subducted sediments and crust of the Pacific plate, there is also a very substantial volume of material from the overriding IBM forearc that is lost to the subduction zone by tectonic erosion .

Dashed box in regional map (upper left) shows area of detail shown in upper right map. Upper right map shows features up to about 100 km on either side of central Mariana Trench. Dashed line shows location of multichannel seismic reflection line 53-53, which is interpreted in lower cross section. Flexure-related faults are outlined in black. Lower figure is a cross-section of the shallow Mariana Subduction Zone along MCS Line 53‚Äì54 with numerically annotated features .The oceanic trench and the associated outer trench swell mark where Pacific Plate begins its descent into the IBM Subduction Zone. The IBM trench is where the Pacific Plate lithosphere begins to sink. The IBM trench is devoid of any significant sediment fill; the ~400 m or so thickness of sediments is completely subducted with the downgoing plate. The IBM outer trench swell rises to about 300 m above the surrounding seafloor just before the trench. The lithosphere that is about to descend into a trench starts to bend just outboard of the trench; the seafloor is elevated into a broad swell that is a few hundred meters high and referred to as the \\"outer trench bulge\\" or ‚Äúouter trench rise‚Äù. The about-to-be subducted plate is highly faulted, allowing seawater to penetrate into the plate interior, where hydration of mantle peridotite may generate serpentinite. Serpentinite thus generated may carry water deep into the mantle as a result of subduction. Geology and composition of the westernmost Pacific plate The Pacific plate subducts in the IBM trench, so understanding what is subducted beneath IBM requires understanding the history of the western Pacific. The IBM arc system subducts mid-Jurassic to Early Cretaceous lithosphere, with younger lithosphere in the north and older lithosphere in the south. It is not possible to directly know the composition of subducted materials presently being processed by the IBM Subduction Factory ‚Äì what is now 130 km deep in the subduction zone entered the trench 4 ‚Äì 10 million years ago. However, the composition of the western Pacific seafloor-oceanic crust ‚Äì sediments, crust, and mantle lithosphere ‚Äì varies sufficiently systematically that, to a first approximation, we can understand what is now being processed by studying what lies on the seafloor east of the IBM trench. The Pacific plate seafloor east of the IBM arc system can be subdivided into a northern portion that is bathymetrically ‚Äòsmooth‚Äô and a southern portion that is bathymetrically rugged, separated by the Ogasawara Plateau. These large-scale variations mark distinct geologic histories to the north and south. The featureless north is dominated by the Nadezhda Basin. In the south, crude alignments of seamounts, atolls, and islands define three great, WNW-ESE trending chains : the Marcus Island-Wake Island-Ogasawara Plateau, the Magellan Seamounts Chain, and the Caroline Islands Ridge. The first two chains formed by off-ridge volcanism during Cretaceous time, whereas the Caroline Islands chain formed over the past 20 million years. Two important basins lie between these chains: the Pigafetta Basin lies between the Marcus-Wake and Magellan chains, and the East Mariana Basin lies between the Magellan and Caroline chains. Simplified geologic and magnetic map of the western Pacific, based on the work of . Relative motion of the Pacific Plate with respect to the Philippine Sea Plate is shown with arrows, numbers correspond to velocities (mm/year), after . Numbers with asterisks represent scientific drilling sites, especially Ocean Drilling Project and Deep Sea Drilling Program drillsites. The age of Western Pacific seafloor has been interpreted from seafloor magnetic anomalies correlated to the geomagnetic reversal timescale and confirmed by Ocean Drilling Program scientific drilling. Three major sets of magnetic anomalies have been identified in the area of interest. Each of these lineation sets comprises M-series (mid-Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous) magnetic anomalies that are essentially \\"growth rings\\" of the Pacific Plate. These anomaly sets indicate that the small, roughly triangular Pacific plate grew by spreading along three ridges . The oldest identifiable lineations are M33 to M35 or perhaps even M38 . It is difficult to say how old these lineations and the older crust might be; the oldest magnetic lineations for which ages have been assigned are M29 (157 Ma; . Magnetic lineations as old as M29 are not known from other oceans, and the area in the Western Pacific that lies inside the M29 lineation ‚Äì that is, crust older than M29 ‚Äì is on the order of 3x106 km2, about a third of the size of the United States. ODP site 801 lies on seafloor that isconsiderably older than M29 and the MORB basement there yields Ar-Ar ages of 167¬±5 Ma . The oldest sediments at site 801C are middle Jurassic, Callovian or latest Bathonian (~162 Ma; ). Seafloor spreading in the Pacific during the Cretaceous evolved from a more E-W 'Tethyan' orientation to the modern N-S trend. This occurred during mid-Cretaceous time, a ~35‚Äì40 Ma interval characterized by a lack of magnetic reversals known as the Cretaceous Superchron or Quiet Zone. Subsequently, the location of N-S trending spreading ridges relative to the Pacific Basin migrated progressively to the east throughout Cretaceous and Tertiary time, resulting in the present marked asymmetry of the Pacific, with very young seafloor in the Eastern Pacific and very old seafloor in the Western Pacific. Sediments being delivered to the IBM trench are not thick considering that this some of Earth's oldest seafloor. Away from seamounts, the pelagic sequence is dominated by chert and pelagic clay, with little carbonate. Carbonates are important near guyots, common in the southern part of the region. Cenozoic sediments are unimportant except for volcanic ash and Asian loess deposited adjacent to Japan and carbonate sediment s associated with the relatively shallow Caroline Ridge and Caroline plate. Strong seafloor currents are probably responsible for this erosion or non-deposition. The compositions of sediments being subducted beneath the northern and southern parts of the IBM arc are significantly different, because of the Cretaceous off-ridge volcanic succession in the south that is missing in the north. Lavas and volcaniclastics associated with an intense episode of intraplate volcanism correspond in time closely to the Cretaceous Superchron. Off-ridge volcanism became increasingly important approaching the Ontong-Java Plateau. There are 100‚Äì400 m thick tholeiitic sills in the East Mariana Basin and Pigafetta Basin , and at least 650 m of tholeiitic flows and sills in the Nauru Basin, near ODP Site 462. suggest that this province may reflect the formation of a mid-Cretaceous spreading system in the Nauru and East Mariana basins. Farther north, deposits related to this episode consist of thick sequences of Aptian-Albian volcaniclastic turbidites shed from emerging volcanic islands, such as preserved at DSDP site 585 and ODP sites 800 and 801. A few hundred meters of volcaniclastic deposits probably characterizes the sedimentary succession in and around the East Mariana and Pigafetta basins. Farther north, at DSDP sites 196 and 307 and ODP site 1149, there is little evidence of mid-Cretaceous volcanic activity. It appears that the Aptian-Albian volcanic episode was largely restricted to the region south of present 20¬∞N latitude. Paleomagnetic and plate kinematic considerations place this broad region of off-ridge volcanism in the present vicinity of Polynesia, where today off-ridge volcanism, shallow bathymetry, and thin lithosphere is known as the 'Superswell' (; ). Sediment cored at Ocean Drilling Program Site 1149 (see previous figure for location). Far right gives lithology and age, 3 columns show vertical variations of Calcium, Silicon, and Aluminum, indicators of relative carbonate, chert, and clay or ash. Modified from Plank et al. (2006). The figure above shows the typical sediments drilled at Ocean Drilling Program site 1149, east of the Izu-Bonin segment. The sediments drilled at ODP site 1149 are about 400 m thick and are as old as 134 million years. The sedimentary section is a typical pelagic stratigraphy, accumulated mostly in the Cretaceous but also in the last 7 million years (late Neogene) built on a basement of Early Cretaceous oceanic crust. The lowermost portion is carbonate and chert, the next layer is very chert-rich, the third layer is clay-rich. This is followed by a long depositional hiatus before sedimentation resumes ~6.5 Ma (Late Miocene), with deposition of volcanic ash, clay, and windblown dust. The stratigraphy east of the Mariana segment differs from that being subducted beneath the Izu-Bonin segment in having a much greater abundance of Early Cretaceous intra-plate volcanics and flood basalts. About 470m of oceanic crust was penetrated at ODP site 801C during Legs 129 and 185. These are typical mid-ocean ridge basalt that were affected by low-temperature hydrothermal alteration. This crust is overlain by a 3 m thick, bright yellow hydrothermal deposit and about 60 m of alkali olivine basalt, 157.4¬±0.5 Ma old . =Geophysics of the subducted slab and mantle= The deep structure of the IBM system has been imaged using a variety of geophysical techniques. This section provides an overview of these data, including a discussion of mantle structure at depths >200 km. Seismicity Spatial patterns of seismicity are essential for locating and understanding the morphology and rheology of subducting lithospheric slabs, and this is particularly true for the IBM Wadati‚ÄìBenioff zone (WBZ). first outlined the most important features of the IBM WBZ. Their study detected a zone of deep earthquakes beneath the southern Marianas and provided some of the first constraints on the deep, vertical nature of subducting Pacific lithosphere beneath southern IBM. They also found a region of reduced shallow seismicity (‚â§70 km) and an absence of deep (‚â• 300 km) events beneath the Volcano Islands adjacent to the junction of the Izu Bonin and Mariana trenches, where the trench trends nearly parallel to the convergence vector. Map view of bathymetry and seismicity in the IBM subduction zone using the earthquake catalog of . Circles denote epicentral locations; lighter circles represent shallower events, darker circles represent deeper events. Black lines denote cross sectional areas depicted in 6 profiles on right, organized from N to S. Black circles represent hypocentral locations in volume ~60 km to each side of the lines shown on the map at left. Large variations in slab dip and maximum depth of seismicity are apparent. Distance along each section is measured from the magmatic arc. A) Northern Izu-Bonin region. Slab dip is ~45¬∞; seismicity tapers off from ~175 km to ~300 km depth but increases around 400 km, and terminates at ~475 km. B) Central Izu Bonin region. Slab dip is nearly vertical; seismicity tapers off from ~100 km to ~325 km but increases in rate and extends horizontally around 500 km, and terminates at ~550 km. C) Southern Izu Bonin region. Slab dip is ~50¬∞; seismicity is continuous to ~200 km, but a very few anomalous events are evident down to ~600 km. D) Northern Mariana region. Slab dip is ~60¬∞; seismicity is continuous to ~375 km and terminates at ~400 km, but a very few anomalous events are evident down to ~600 km. E) Central Mariana region. Slab dip is vertical; seismicity tapers off slightly between ~275 km and ~575 km, but is essentially continuous. A pocket of deep events around 600 km exists, as well as 1 deep event at 680 km. F) Southern Mariana region. Slab dip is ~55¬∞; seismicity is continuous to ~225 km, with an anomalous event at 375 km. Figure courtesy of Dr. Matt Fouch, Arizona State University More recently, provided an earthquake catalog containing improved locations (Figure 10). This data set shows that, beneath northern IBM, the dip of the WBZ steepens smoothly from ~40¬∞ to ~80¬∞ southwards, and seismicity diminishes between depths of ~150 km and ~300 km (Figures 11a c). The subducted slab beneath central IBM (near 25¬∞N; Fig. 11c) is delineated by reduced seismic activity that nevertheless defines a more vertical orientation that persists southward (Figures 11d f). Deep earthquakes, here defined as seismic events ‚â•300 km deep, are common beneath parts of the IBM arc system (Figures 10, 11). Deep events in the IBM system are less frequent than for most other subduction zones with deep seismicity, such as Tonga/Fiji/Kermadec and South America. Beneath northern IBM, deep seismicity extends southward to ~27.5¬∞N, and a small pocket of events between 275 km and 325 km depth exists at ~22¬∞N. There is narrow band of deep earthquakes beneath southern IBM between ~21¬∞N and ~17¬∞N, but south of this there are extremely few deep events. Although early studies assumed that seismicity demarcated the upper boundary of the slab, more recent evidence has shown that many of these earthquakes occur within the slab. For instance, a study by showed that a region of events beneath northernmost IBM region occur ~20 km beneath the top of the subducting plate. They propose that transformational faulting, which occurs when metastable olivine changes to a more compact spinel structure, produces this zone of seismicity. Indeed, the faulting mechanism for deep earthquakes is a hotly debated topic (e.g., ), and has yet to be resolved. Double seismic zones (DSZs) have been detected in several parts of the IBM subduction zone, but their locations within the slab as well as interpretations for their existence vary dramatically. Beneath southern IBM, found a DSZ lying 80 km and 120 km deep, with the two zones separated by 30 35 km. Earthquake focal mechanisms indicate that the upper zone, where most events occur, is in downdip compression, while the lower zone is in downdip extension. This DSZ is located at a depth where the curvature of slab is greatest; at greater depths it unbends into a more planar donfiguration. suggested that unbending or thermal stresses in the upper 150 km of the slab may the primary cause of the seismicity. For northern IBM, used a refined earthquake relocation scheme to detect a DSZ between depths of 300 km and 400 km, which also has a spacing of 30 35 km between the upper and lower zones. They interpreted data from S to P converted phases and thermal modeling to propose that the DSZ results from transformational faulting of a metastable olivine wedge in the slab. Recent work suggests that compositional variations in the subducting slab may also contribute to double seismic zone , or that DSZs represent the locus of serpentine dehydration in the slab . =Mariana Arc volcanism and hydrothermal activity= Bathymetry of the Mariana arc region , showing all 51 edifices presently named along the volcanic front between 12¬∞30‚ÄôN and 23¬∞10‚ÄôN. Hydrothermally or volcanically active submarine edifices are labeled red; active subaerial edifices are labeled green. Inactive submarine and subaerial edifices are labeled in smaller black and green font, respectively. For all edifices, caldera labels are in bold italics. Black circles (20 km diameter) identify those volcanic centers composed of multiple individual edifices. Solid red line is the backarc spreading center. Arc volcanism identified 76 volcanic edifices along 1370 km of the Mariana arc, grouped into 60 ‚Äò‚Äòvolcanic centers,‚Äô‚Äô of which at least 26 (20 submarine) are hydrothermally or volcanically active. The overall volcanic center density is 4.4/100 km of arc, and that of active centers is 1.9/100 km. Active volcanoes lie 80 to 230 km above the subducting Pacific plate, and ~25% lie behind the arc magmatic front. There is no evidence for a regular spacing of volcanoes along the Mariana arc. The frequency distribution of volcano spacing along the arc magmatic front peaks between 20 and 30 km and shows the asymmetric, long-tail shape typical for many other arcs. The first global compilation of arc volcanoes using recent bathymetric data estimated that arcs that are at least partially submarine have a population of almost 700 volcanoes, of which at least 200 are submerged . Arc hydrothermal activity estimated that intraoceanic arcs combined may contribute hydrothermal emissions equal to ~10% of that from the global mid-ocean ridge system. Historical importance of IBM arc system Guam in the southern IBM arc system is where Magellan first landed after his epic crossing of the Pacific Ocean in 1521. The Bonin Islands were a significant stop for water and supplies for New England whaling during the early 19th century. At that time they were known as the Peel Islands. Terrible battles were fought on the islands of Saipan and Iwo Jima in 1944 and 1945; many young Japanese and American soldiers died in these battles. George H. W. Bush was shot down in 1945 near Chichijima in the Bonin Islands. Twelve Japanese seamen were stranded in June 1944 on volcanic Anatahan for seven years, along with the overseer of the abandoned plantation and an attractive young Japanese woman. The novel and 1953 movie Anatahan is based on these events. The B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew from Tinian to drop the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945. Sergeant Shoichi Yokoi hid out in the wilds of Guam for 28 years before coming out of hiding in 1972. The Brown tree snake was accidentally introduced during World War II and has since devastated native birds on Guam.

CD103 binds integrin beta 7 (Œ≤7‚Äì ITGB7) to form the complete heterodimeric integrin molecule Œ±EŒ≤7, which has no distinct name. The Œ±EŒ≤7 complex is often referred to as \\"CD103\\" though this strictly refers only to the Œ±E chain. Note that the Œ≤7 subunit can bind with other integrin Œ± chains, such as Œ±4 (CD49d).  Tissue distribution  CD103 is expressed widely on intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) T cells (both Œ±Œ≤ T cells and Œ≥Œ¥ T cells) and on some peripheral regulatory T cells (Tregs). It has also been reported on lamina propria T cells. A subset of dendritic cells in the gut mucosa and mesenteric lymph nodes, known as CD103 dendritic cells, also expresses this marker. It is useful in identifying hairy cell leukemia which is positive for this marker in contrast to most other hematologic malignancies which are negative for CD103 except enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma.  Function  The chief ligand for Œ±EŒ≤7 is E-cadherin, a cellular adhesion molecule (CAM) found on epithelial cells. It is probably important for T cell homing to the intestinal sites. Tregs are important for decreasing the immune response and appear to play a crucial role in the prevention of autoimmune diseases. Tregs are defined as CD4+/CD25+/Foxp3+ cells. Some CD4+/FoxP3‚àí cells also express CD103 and have been attributed regulatory activity. It is unclear whether the presence of CD103 on Treg cells represents a specialized feature for Treg, or Treg differentiation of IEL T cells.

It serves the Lowell Line as well as a limited number of trains from the Haverhill Line which run via the Wildcat Branch. It is located near the intersection of Main Street (Routes 38/129) and Church Street (Route 62) in Wilmington's town center. The station is accessible, with mini-high platforms serving both tracks. Station layout and history Interlocking south of Wilmington station in May 2016. This interlocking allows southbound trains from the Wildcat Branch to reach the southbound main, as well as serving as a general purpose crossover. The platforms are staggered; the southbound platform is entirely to the north of the Route 62 overpass, while over half of the northbound platform is south of the bridge. A pedestrian crossing between the two platforms is located just north of the bridge; until a path from an adjacent apartment complex opened in 2015, this was the only access to the southbound platform. The station formerly had a single small side platform and no MBTA parking lot. In 1998, the MBTA began planning a $5.2 million renovation which included longer accessible platforms and a 227-space parking lot. The project was completed in 2003 at a total cost of $13 million. The Wildcat Branch, used by Amtrak Downeaster trains and some Haverhill Line express trains, connects with the Lowell Line at Wilmington station. The single-track branch splits from the northbound track just north of the platform. Southbound trains coming from the Wildcat Branch cannot reach the southbound platform; instead, they use the northbound platform. An interlocking south of the station allows these trains to switch onto the southbound track. The Boston and Lowell Railroad originally had no intermediate stations, but Wilmington petitioned for a stop as early as 1836. An early station building was constructed either for the Andover and Wilmington Railroad in 1835 or 1836, or for the B&L; and B&M; a decade later. It was replaced by a small wooden structure around 1887. Both structures are still extant; the earlier structure was moved east on Church Street in the 1890s and reused as a house, while the newer structure houses a business.

He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2014, and returned to the Diet (national legislature) in 2016 as a member of the House of Councillors. Early life Watanabe is a native of Nishinasuno, Nasu District, Tochigi (now part of the city of Nasushiobara) and graduated from Waseda University and Chuo University. His father is Michio Watanabe, a major political figure first elected to the Diet while Watanabe was in junior high school. Watanabe developed an interest in politics soon after his father was elected to office, and served as his father's secretary during the elder Watanabe's appointments as Minister of International Trade and Industry and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Yoshimi Watanabe's nephew Michitaro Watanabe is also a politician (member of the House of Councilors). Political career Following his father's death in 1995, Watanabe was elected to the House of Representatives for the first time in the 1996 general election, representing the Tochigi 3rd district, a newly created seat in his father's previous constituency in Tochigi Prefecture. Watanabe continued to represent the district, having successfully defended it in five subsequent general elections before being defeated in 2014. He was tapped by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to lead an administrative reform commission studying the potential for implementing the d≈çsh≈´sei federal government system in Japan, and served in this capacity from 2006 to 2007. From August 2007 to August 2008, Cabinet of Yasuo Fukuda served as Minister in charge of financial services and Minister in charge of administrative reform,he urged the U.S. government to use public funds to solve the deepening subprime mortgage crisis, stating that \\"if there is a big hole in the bottom of the tub, no matter how much hot water you keep adding, you will never have enough hot water.\\" He supported Yuriko Koike in the 2008 LDP leadership election, which was ultimately won by Taro Aso. =Your Party= Watanabe formed Your Party as a splinter from the Liberal Democratic Party prior to the 2009 general election. His party ran on a platform of downsizing Japan's vast bureaucracy, but managed to win only five seats in the election, which was a resounding victory for the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. The party pushed forward into 2010 with a platform of deregulation and halving the corporate tax rate. His new party became popular among private investors and upper middle-class professionals. Your Party won ten seats in the House of Councillors in the 2010 election, the third-strongest showing behind the LDP and DPJ. Watanabe planned to use his party's popularity to push for fiscal reforms, stating: \\"Our priority is anti-deflation legislation because Japan's economy faces the risk of a double-dip recession. We want to revise the BOJ law so the central bank and the government can agree on a goal of 2 percent inflation within two to three years.\\" Watanabe was chosen as the Japanese public's most preferred candidate for prime minister in a July 2010 poll. In January 2012, Watanabe announced that Your Party would join forces with Osaka governor Toru Hashimoto's political group Osaka Ishin-no-kai, and praised Hashimoto's economic reform efforts in Osaka. He announced that Your Party would sever ties with Hashimoto's Japan Restoration Party in May 2013 after Hashimoto made controversial comments regarding comfort women being a necessary part of World War II and suggesting that American servicemen use the Japanese sex industry to keep their urges under control. Watanabe opposed the appointment of Haruhiko Kuroda as president of the Bank of Japan, saying that he would prefer to see a president come from a background other than the Ministry of Finance; he instead supported Heizo Takenaka for the position. =Scandal and resignation= In April 2014, Watanabe was found to have accepted a loan of 800 million yen from the chairman of a cosmetics company without disclosing it as a political donation. While insisting that the loan was used for personal purposes and not for political activities, he resigned as president of Your Party. The party commissioned an investigation by an outside attorney and CPA, who found that Watanabe had paid interest on the loan and had mainly used the funds for paying credit card bills for himself and his wife. While they found no violation of campaign finance laws, they discovered that Watanabe had also borrowed money from five other parties totaling 615 million yen. In the 2014 House of Representatives election, Watanabe lost his Tochigi 3 seat as an independent to Liberal Democrat Kazuo Yana by more than 11.000 votes.Yomiuri Shimbun: 2014 House of Representatives election results, Tochigi In the 2016 House of Councillors election, Initiatives from Osaka announced that he would be nominated in the (nationwide) proportional district.Initiatives from Osaka: Candidates for the 24th regular election of members of the House of Councillors He won a seat in the election, stating after the victory that \\"the story of my 'revenge' starts today.

Biography =Early life= Jacobson as a teenager The Jacobson family had mostly moved to the American West Coast by the early 1930s after having originally immigrated to Northfield, Minnesota from Norway. Clayton Junior Jacobson or Clayton Jacobson II was born in Multnomah County Hospital, Portland, OR on October 12, 1933 to Clayton Jacobson and Sarah Fauntelle Shrock. By the mid-1940s Jacobson, his parents and his sister Carmen had made their way to what they referred to as the promised land, Southern California. In addition to his studies in physics and engineering while at Manual Arts High School and Los Angeles City College, Jacobson spent much of his time bodybuilding, street racing and working at an automotive garage. Having had a strong fascination with airplane seats and flying while growing up, Jacobson joined the Marine Corps Reserve (Air Corps) in an effort to work closely with the jets at Los Alamitos Army Airfield (formerly Los Alamitos Naval Airstation) and to learn drafting and jet engine technology. =Before the Jet Ski= Jacobson went to work in wholesale food for a short while, and while doing so met his would be wife Dianne, with whom he'd have four children: Karen, Margo, Clayton 3 and Tava. Jacobson left the food business to begin working with Diane's father at his savings and loan. He moved the family to Palos Verdes, CA and became heavily involved in motocross racing. =Invention of the Jet Ski= \\"...that's me #597 racing the day I invented the jet ski. What happened was, I fell down somewhere along in this day and abraded my arm, gravel road rash on my arm, my shoulder and my neck. We stopped at an irrigation ditch on the way home, have a beer, burn one and get the gravel out.\\" During the early 1960s Jacobson had become a very serious motorcycle racer and frequently found himself in the Mojave Desert heat while riding. One somewhat dangerous way to beat the heat and gain some psychological advantage was to ride with no padded leather jumper or sleeves. One day on the way home after a minor crash on the racetrack, Jacobson found himself taking a break in an irrigation ditch to have a beer with a friend while picking the gravel out of his wounds and lamenting that there had to be a way to enjoy the exhilaration and excitement of a motorcycle without the inherent danger of falling onto hard ground at high speeds. That night Jacobson sketched his \\"motorcycle for the water\\"; which, at the time, looked like a sort of powered water ski. =Personal watercraft development= *Stand-up: The first prototype By the mid 1960s Jacobson had quit his work in finance to pursue developing his jet ski concept full-time. The first prototype was up and running by 1965. This fixed-handlepole, stand-up design was constructed out of aluminum and powered by a West Bend two-stroke engine driving a Berkeley jet pump. A second prototype, built in 1966, caught the attention of what was, at the time, primarily a snow-mobile manufacturer, Bombardier Recreational Products; and prompted the licensing of Jacobson's patents for the sit-down version of his jet-propelled personal watercraft that would become the Sea-Doo. In all, Jacobson would eventually build 12 different stand-up prototypes. His development of the stand-up models continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s resulting in additional patents for a pivoting handlepole and a self-righting function. *Sit-down: A 320cc Rotax engine was used for development. The Rotax engine required a larger planing surface and sufficient induction for its air cooling, so Jacobson developed an entirely new sit-down model to adapt. Jacobson applied for a patent on the sit-down model in February 1968 and received the patent a year later in February 1969. =Licensing= Sit-down prototype *Bombardier: Bombardier entered a licensing agreement with Jacobson for his sit-down personal watercraft patents in order to produce their first model of Sea-Doo, which was produced from 1968 to 1970.Sampsell, Michael M.; et al. (2002). Boat Accident Reconstruction and Litigation. Lawyers & Judges Publishing. pp. 63‚Äì4. *Kawasaki: Jacobson's agreement with Bombardier prevented him from entering into any other licensing agreement until 1971, at which point he entered into an exclusive agreement to license his patents and development on the stand-up models to Kawasaki. By this point Jacobson was on his 7th prototype stand-up model. Kawasaki introduced the first production stand-up Jet Ski in 1973. In 1976 Kawasaki sent a letter of intent to end their agreement with Jacobson, which resulted in legal dispute and the loss of Kawasaki's licenses' exclusivity.Unknown author (1992-08-17). \\"Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd.: U.S. Unit, Inventor Reach Settlement in Legal Dispute\\".

It is located just northeast of downtown Tampa and north of Port Tampa Bay. The neighborhood has distinct architectural, culinary, cultural, and historical legacy that reflects its multi-ethnic composition. It was unique in the American South as a prosperous manufacturing community built and populated almost entirely by immigrants. Ybor City was founded as an independent town in 1885 by a group of cigar manufacturers led by Vicente Martinez-Ybor and was annexed by Tampa in 1887. The original population was mostly composed of Cuban and Spanish immigrants who worked in the cigar factories. Italian and Eastern-European Jewish immigrants followed shortly thereafter and established many retail shops, farms and grocery stores, box factories, print shops, and other enterprises which catered to the cigar industry and its workers. Restored casitas at the Ybor City Museum State Park Martinez-Ybor started the practice of building small houses, \\"casitas\\", that his workers could buy at cost, in order to increase staff retention. He also helped to ensure medical care and paved the local streets and sidewalks.Ybor City: Past, Present, and FutureVICENTE MARTINEZ-YBOR ( C. 1818-1896) The neighborhood grew rapidly during the 1890s, quickly evolving from a primitive outpost with streets of loose sand populated mainly by young Cuban and Spanish men seeking work into a bustling city with modern amenities and a diverse demographic makeup. During this decade, Ybor City's residents founded mutual aid societies, labor organizations, newspapers in several languages, and many other social and civic organizations along with a diverse roster of businesses, helping to create a vibrant civil society that blended the residents' different cultures of origin into a new \\"Latin\\" culture unique to Tampa. Ybor City continued to grow and prosper through the 1920s, by which time its factories were producing almost half a billion hand-rolled cigars every year, giving Tampa the nickname of the \\"Cigar City\\". The coming of the Great Depression in the early 1930s brought a sharp reduction in the worldwide demand for fine cigars, and Ybor City's economic base suffered greatly. Some cigar factories closed, others ended the hand-rolled tradition and turned to mechanization to reduce costs, and remaining operations sharply decreased production and payrolls, resulting in widespread unemployment and hardship across the entire neighborhood. Demand for cigars increased after World War II, but by that time, almost all of Ybor City's cigar factories were mechanized and did not re-hire the skilled and well-paid artisans they had once employed by the thousands. As veterans returned from the war, they largely chose to leave the aging neighborhood for areas with better housing and economic prospects, accelerating the trend of declining population and economic contraction. This process accelerated further through the 1950s and 60s, when the federal Urban Renewal program and the construction of Interstate 4 resulted in the demolition of many structures, including hundreds of housing units. Planned redevelopment never took place, and, with its commercial district and social core virtually abandoned, Ybor City lapsed into a period of neglect and decay. Beginning in the 1980s, the old business district centered on 7th Avenue (La Septima) began a slow recovery, first as a bohemian haven for artists and, by the early 1990s, as a popular nightlife and entertainment district. Since 2000, many historic structures near 7th Avenue have been renovated and restored, and construction has filled in most long- vacant lots. Among the new structures are hotels, office and retail space, and apartment complexes, leading to the Ybor City's first population increases in over half a century. Residential areas such as V.M. Ybor and Tampa Heights have also begun to see gentrification, with older structures being restored and new ones built. While Ybor City's old business district and some nearby residential areas have been revitalized, not all of the original neighborhood has shared in the recovery. Poverty and blight are ongoing problems in portions of Greater Ybor City, especially north of I-4 and east of 22nd Street. Establishment = Guavas and cigars = Gavino Gutierrez Ybor City came into existence as a direct result of a New York City businessman's failed search for guava trees. Spanish √©migr√© Gavino Gutierrez was a civil engineer by training, but was employed by a New York City fruit packing and canning firm in the mid-1880s. He had heard that there were many guava trees growing wild in the Tampa Bay area and, looking to add to his company's product line, set out to find them in November 1884. The trip was long and difficult. The existing railroad line to Florida run by the Plant System only went as far south as Jacksonville, Florida, with a steamboat connection down the St. Johns River to Sanford, Florida (near present-day Orlando). Gutierrez took the rest of the trip across the state by stagecoach over unpaved country roads (an isolated rail line, the South Florida Railroad, connected Sanford and Tampa at this time and was completed less than a year prior to Gutierrez's visit). Gutierrez did not find any commercial quality guavas in the isolated village of Tampa. The community's main commercial activities were fishing and the shipping of Florida cattle and citrus from its small port. The local economy was struggling; however, Henry Plant, owner of the Plant System and majority shareholder of the South Florida Railroad, was in the process of extending his network of railroad lines across the state, which would eventually connect Tampa directly with the rest of the U.S. rail system. Gutierrez left Tampa convinced that the area had the potential for development once the railroad was complete. Tampa would acquire its first direct rail connection to the rest of the country via a line built by the Jacksonville, Tampa and Key West Railway, which opened on February 20, 1886 and connected the Plant System at Jacksonville with the South Florida Railroad at Sanford. This line would later be purchased by the Plant System in 1899. Vicente Martinez YborGutierrez returned to New York by sea, stopping on the way to visit his friend Vicente Martinez Ybor at his home in Key West, Florida. Ybor was a fellow Spaniard who had built a prosperous cigar-making operation in Havana, Cuba based on his El Pr√≠ncipe de Gales (Prince of Wales) brand. However, Ybor had provided public support and private financial assistance to Cuban revolutionaries fighting against Spanish colonial rule, and had escaped from Cuba with his family in 1868 to avoid being arrested or killed by the Spanish authorities. Ybor rebuilt a successful business in Key West. However, by the early 1880s, high costs, labor strife, and transportation issues (overseas land links were still decades away) had him exploring relocation options once again. Several southern American port cities such as Mobile, Alabama; Pensacola, Florida; and Galveston, Texas had offered land and other concessions to attract Ybor's factories to their town, but none of the proposals were satisfactory. Upon learning about Ybor's plans, Gutierrez mentioned Tampa as another possible site for relocation. Ybor was intrigued, as was Ignacio Haya, a visiting Spanish cigar manufacturer from New York who was also looking for a new factory location. Haya and Ybor boarded the next available steamship sailing for Tampa and arrived the next day. They agreed that Tampa was an excellent location for cigar production: it was near enough to Cuba that importing Cuban tobacco by sea would be quick and cheap; the climate was warm and humid, which would keep the tobacco leaves fresh and workable; and Plant's new railroad line would make it easy to ship the finished cigars across the United States. However, Ybor continued negotiating with other cities while opening talks with Tampa's Board of Trade to secure land and other enticements. =Making a deal= Months later, in September 1885, Ybor and Haya set out on a \\"fact- finding mission\\" to the most promising relocation sites, hoping to finalize a deal and begin moving their operations soon thereafter. Their first visit was to Tampa, where the sticking point was the price of a tract of land that Ybor was interested in buying from John T. Lesley for $9000, but Ybor was only willing to pay $5000. Ybor had hoped that face to face negotiations would facilitate an agreement, but neither side was willing to budge. Seemingly at an impasse, Ybor and Haya prepared to move on to their next potential site: Galveston, Texas. But on October 5, 1885, as the men were literally about to depart, the Tampa Board of Trade, including W. C. Brown and W. B. Henderson, offered to subsidize the $4000 difference in the price of the land Ybor wished to buy. Ybor readily agreed, and quickly moved to purchase 50 more adjoining acres. Haya bought his own smaller tract. Preparation to move their cigar operations began immediately. On October 8, only three days after making the real estate deals, Ybor had crews at work clearing the land and had invited Gavino Gutierrez to lay out a street grid for a new town, which was to be dubbed Ybor City. There was almost a major crisis before the settlement got started. The only bank in Tampa at the time was a branch of the Jacksonville- based First National Bank. Due to the stagnant state of commercial business in town, bank management had decided to close the location. When Ignacio Haya heard the news, he visited the bank's office to find the fixtures and equipment being packed up for shipment back to Jacksonville. Haya explained to branch manager T.C. Taliaferro that he and Ybor would need the services of a local bank to run their operations, and promised that the initial payroll would come to at least $10,000. On his own volition, Taliaferro began unpacking the boxes. The branch remained open and the crisis was averted. =Company town= Cigar making was not just a job to the tabaqueros (literally, \\"tobacco workers\\"). The torcedores who rolled the finished cigars, especially, thought of themselves as \\"more of an artist than a worker.\\" The trade was closely regulated by the tabaqueros in a manner reminiscent of the artisan's guilds of old Europe. Beginners trained through lengthy apprenticeships in the hopes of someday becoming a well-respected (and well- paid) master torcedor. Key West was home to thousands of trained tabaqueros in 1885. In contrast, Tampa was a small town with a population of about 3,000 and no resident cigar workers. Ybor would have to convince potential employees to leave established communities in Key West (and Cuba and New York) to help build a frontier settlement. While he enjoyed the goodwill of many Cuban tabaqueros because of his well-known support for Cuba Libre, that would not be enough. Ybor's idea was to build a modified company town. Unlike other such communities in which the company owned virtually all of the housing and businesses (such as Pullman, Illinois), Ybor envisioned a place in which employees could own their homes and private entrepreneurs could buy land on which to build businesses. This, he hoped, would create a pleasant environment to better attract more residents to Ybor City. Ybor also had good business reasons to be magnanimous. His goal was to not only attract residents to town, but to get them to stay. His employees in Key West had often traveled back and forth between Florida and Cuba looking for the best pay and conditions. By offering the anchor of land and home ownership ‚Äì something most tabaqueros had never experienced, especially in land-scarce Key West ‚Äì Ybor encouraged his workers to stick around. Though the workforce was still relatively fluid in the early years, enough workers remained in Tampa to keep the cigar factories fully staffed and running year-round. Along with the hastily built wooden factories constructed by Ybor and Haya, some of the first structures in Ybor City were 50 small houses (casitas) for prospective employees. These narrow shotgun-style homes (so called because a shot fired through the front door would theoretically exit harmlessly out of the aligned back door) were small wooden structures, but they were well-built and relatively comfortable. Ybor offered them for sale at a price just above his cost to build them (initially $400), payable in small deductions from the workers' salary in his cigar factory. Another of Ybor's modifications to the company town model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) company town. To increase the number of jobs (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar workers and other cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few were willing to take the risk of moving to and buying a home in a new place that might not last. Cigar maker's tools, Ybor City Museum State Park On April 13, 1886, Haya's factory produced the first Ybor City cigar. Ybor's factory followed suit a few days later. At the time, they still had less than 100 employees between them. Later in the same month, Key West suffered a fire that ravaged much of the city. Hundreds of homes and several cigar factories were destroyed, including Ybor's still-operational main location. Needing jobs and not willing to wait for their homes and workplaces to be rebuilt, many tabaqueros decided to pack up their surviving belongings and board a steamship for Tampa. The fire also encouraged several Key West cigar manufacturers to either build a branch factory in Ybor City or relocate altogether. Cigar makers in New York and Cuba also took note, and many followed suit in the coming years. More available jobs in the cigar industry attracted more residents. Cigar workers found ready employment in the ever-growing number of large factories and small storefront shops (\\"buckeyes\\") and came in ever-growing numbers. More immigration meant more amenities such as a wider range of businesses and more opportunities for social and cultural events, which in turn attracted more new residents, which attracted more businesses, etc. This cycle of growth lasted until the late 1920s, by which time Ybor City was home to hundreds of cigar making businesses and tens of thousands of permanent residents and had a thriving cultural scene. By the end of 1886, Ybor's and Haya's factories had combined to produce over 1,000,000 hand-rolled cigars in just over six months. This number would be dwarfed in the years to come. Early Ybor City: 1886‚Äì1901 World's largest cigar factory, 1902 Sandy street in Ybor City, 1886 = From frontier town to bustling neighborhood = In 1888, Ybor completed an imposing 3-story brick building which was the largest cigar factory in the world at the time,http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/jun/04/church-scientology-buys-historic- ybor-square/news-breaking/ and in 1897 he opened The Florida Brewing Company building which was the tallest building in Tampa until 1913. But for the most part, the Ybor City that greeted the first arrivals was primitive. Structures in the new town were mainly wooden and quickly built. Unpaved streets of thick sand made travel difficult, especially by wagon. There were no sidewalks or streetlights, and nighttime travelers often carried a lantern to find their way and a gun for protection from alligators, bears, panthers, or other wildlife that often wandered into town from the surrounding swamps, forests, and scrubland. As an early resident observed, \\"What we found when we arrived was a stinking hole with swamps and pestilence everywhere.\\" As is typical in boom towns, many of the first residents of Ybor City were either unmarried men or men who had left their families behind (if only temporarily) to take jobs in a place where work was plentiful but living conditions were rough. These pioneers began the process of developing the community. As another early resident explains, \\"[the first immigrants] did not arrive in a city where they found work; they created a city out of the work they did.\\" By 1887, Tampa city leaders had expressed concern about the lack of a trained police force in the rapidly growing \\"wild frontier town\\". They also saw the potential to greatly increase the city's tax rolls by gaining control of the prosperous community that had suddenly sprouted just outside the city limits. So on June 2, 1887, Tampa annexed Ybor City over the protestations of Ybor himself, who felt that relinquishing civil authority would add nothing to his company town except new regulations and red tape. In spite (or because) of its new status as a \\"city within a city\\", by the turn of the 20th Century, Ybor City had many fine brick buildings, paved streets with streetlights, a streetcar line connecting it to Tampa and other nearby communities, and ever-expanding cultural and social opportunities. The civic improvements were made possible by Ybor City's effect on Tampa's revenue. In 1885, the annual export-import duties collected at Tampa's port totaled $683. In 1895, they totaled over $625,000, due almost entirely to the importing of fine Cuban tobacco and the exporting of Tampa- made cigars.  Rapid growth and diversification  Tampa's city budget was not the only number that experienced tremendous growth after Ybor City's annexation. From less than 800 residents in 1880, the population of Tampa had risen to over 5000 in 1890 and almost 16,000 in 1900. The vast majority of these new residents were immigrants who had settled in Ybor City. One factor that expedited the city's growth was US immigration policy of the time. While thousands of immigrants from all over the world were carefully screened at major immigrant processing centers like Angel Island in San Francisco and Ellis Island in New York, there were few restrictions on immigration from Cuba, and the restrictions that existed were laxly enforced at the port of Tampa. With few impediments, the flow of Cuban and Spanish workers and their families back and forth between Florida and Cuba was both substantial and largely undocumented. Despite V.M. Ybor's efforts to anchor his employees in Tampa through home ownership, many Ybor City cigar workers were still open to heading back to Cuba to seek out better wages and conditions into the 1890s. Due to this divided national loyalty, it would be years before many of the early residents of Ybor City became American citizens, and many never saw reason to apply at all. In the largely insular community, immigrants could live surrounded by their own culture, so attachment to their countries of origin remained high, especially in the first generation. = Diversification = The population of Ybor City diversified through the late 1880s and early 1890s as an influx of Italian immigrants began to arrive. Almost all of them were originally from the poverty-stricken Sicilian towns of Alessandria Della Rocca and Santo Stefano Quisquina, though many had first tried to find work in New Orleans, New York City, or the sugar cane fields of the Kissimmee/St. Cloud area in central Florida before relocating to Tampa. Arriving around the same time were a small number of Jewish immigrants, mainly Romanians and Germans escaping religious persecution and looking for economic opportunities. Not having cigar making experience, they were unable to break into the tightly self-regulated industry in any numbers. As they tried to learn Spanish (the language of Ybor City) and English (the language of the rest of Tampa), they initially took whatever work they could find. Eventually, many opened businesses catering to the cigar factories and their workers. Most notable among these were successful grocery, clothing, and general goods stores; cigar box and cigar box art firms; and vegetable and dairy farms established in rural areas a few miles east of the city. =Cuba Libre= Jose Marti (center) with cigar workers on the steps of V.M. Ybor's cigar factory, 1893 Before 1900, a majority of the residents of early Ybor City considered themselves Cuban, with Spaniards comprising the second largest group. Consequently, the ongoing Cuban struggle for independence from Spanish colonial rule was a topic of intense interest and constant tension in the immigrant community. The issue had caused controversy right from the start. In 1886, Vicente Martinez-Ybor's cigar factory had been the first to be built and equipped. However, the start of production was delayed because his Cuban workers refused to work for a Spanish foreman who had earned an anti-Cuban reputation in Key West. Only after the offending supervisor was replaced (and after Ignacio Haya's factory had already rolled the first Ybor City cigars) would V.M. Ybor's workers return to their benches. When Cuba seemed poised to erupt again in the early 1890s, Ybor City became a vital source of funds, equipment, and inspiration for the independence-seekers. \\"El dia pa la patria\\" (\\"one day for the homeland\\") - donating one day's pay per week to the Cuban cause - became a patriotic duty for Tampa's Cuban population, with some of their Italian, Jewish, and even Spanish neighbors chipping in. Jose Marti, the \\"Apostle of Cuban Independence\\", visited Ybor City and West Tampa many times, delivering several passionate speeches to audiences of thousands. One 1893 speech from the steps of Ybor's factory was reprinted in newspapers all over the US and Cuba and led directly to war. A few Tampa residents volunteered to fight alongside Marti in Cuba, and many lost their lives in 1895 during the same skirmish that killed their inspirational leader. Donations and organizing continued among Tampa's Latin population through 1898, when the US entered the ongoing struggle and it escalated into the larger Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Henry Plant used his contacts in the War Department to make Tampa the main port of embarkation for US forces on their way to the conflict, providing a huge economic boost both to his railroad line and to Tampa as a whole. Over 30,000 troops (about double Tampa's total population at the time) and thousands of railcars full of supplies arrived to await orders to ship out, providing sudden prosperity for local businesses but stretching the small town's resources to the limit. The troops were particularly welcome in Ybor City by Cubans who surmised that \\"Cuba Libre\\" was finally within reach. They were correct. The war lasted only a few months, and ended with Spain losing most of her remaining colonial possessions. Some Cubans jubilantly left Tampa for their homeland, eager to enjoy the fruits of their long-fought revolution. However, most of these would eventually return. The main factors in their decision was the lack of economic opportunities and general devastation resulting from years of conflict, and the realization that Spanish colonial control had simply been replaced by American neo-colonial control. As a group, they overwhelmingly choose to put down roots and settle in Ybor City for the long term, though some migration for family and work reasons continued. The \\"Golden Age\\": 1902‚Äì1929 With the turn of the 20th Century, the perception of Ybor City residents had evolved. Previously, many residents had thought of Tampa as a temporary place to work and live; a refuge from the political and/or economic troubles in their homelands. By the early 1900s, however, attitudes had changed. Ybor City had become a permanent home. One major factor was the neighborhood's high quality of life. Like most immigrant communities at the time, Ybor City had everything a recent arrival could need: work, shops, schools, churches, and most importantly, other immigrants who shared the language and customs of the old country. But unlike most U.S. immigrant enclaves of the period, Ybor City was no slum. The \\"Latin\\" residents of Ybor City created a bustling community that combined Cuban, Spanish, Italian, and Jewish culture into a unique mix. \\"Ybor City is Tampa's Spanish India,\\" observed a visitor to the area, \\"What a colorful, screaming, shrill, and turbulent world.\\" Distinctive red brick and iron balconied architecture cuisine, such as the deviled crab, emerged. But it took more than pride to turn a sand-clogged primitive village into a thriving neighborhood; it took the financial resources of a prosperous industry. During the first decades of the 20th century, the port duties and the payrolls of Tampa's cigar manufacturers were the engine that made the city grow and prosper. Cigar workers, especially experienced rollers of the finer cigar varieties, made a good wage and could afford to frequent the many shops in downtown Tampa and in Ybor City's commercial district centered on 7th Avenue (La S√©ptima). The tabaquero culture emphasized professionalism and encouraged \\"tasteful appreciation of the finer things in life\\", much to the appreciation of Tampa's shopkeepers. By pumping out hundreds of millions of hand-rolled cigars annually (the peak was 500,000,000 in 1929, right before the Great Depression took hold), the cigar workers of Ybor City not only made a good life for themselves, but also pumped millions of dollars into the coffers of local businesses and city government. L'Unione Italiana (The Italian Club) =The Mutual Aid Societies (social clubs)= Mutual aid societies and social clubs were used to improve life for the residents of Ybor City and have been called the \\"heart\\" of Ybor City.WPA Stories: Ybor City The longest-lasting of these organizations were the Deutscher-Americaner (German-American Club), L'Unione Italiana (Italian Club), La Union Mart√≠-Maceo, Circulo Cubano (Cuban Club), El Centro Espa√±ol, and El Centro Asturiano. These clubs were founded in Ybor City's early days (the 1st had been the Centro Espa√±ol in 1891) as places were new arrivals could find support and community among other people from their country of origin. As time went on, they offered a broader range of social and entertainment opportunities. Despite the immigrant element, Ybor City's mutual aid clubs had less in common with aid associations such as Hull House and other settlement houses than with benefit societies and fraternal organizations. Ybor City's social clubs were founded by immigrants for the benefit of immigrants - the funds to build the large and often opulent clubhouses and to operate the organizations came from dues collected from members, usually about 5% of a member's salary. The German-American (Deutscher-Americaner) Club El Centro Asturiano While the clubs provided a place to socialize, the main reason they were founded was to provide basic medical care for their members. Medical care at Ybor City clinics was included for the price of weekly dues, and two of the clubs (El Centro Asturiano and El Centro Espa√±ol) also established hospitals. In the days before medical insurance, this benefit was a compelling reason for residents to join. Besides medical care, the clubs offered many social activities. Club buildings housed gymnasiums, cantinas (small caf√©s for members), and large auditoriums for concerts and often elaborate theatrical performances. They also organized events such as dances and picnics, sometimes hiring buses for outings at Ballast Point Park, Clearwater Beach, or other locations outside of Ybor City itself. An active club filled a family's social calendar, and collectively, they served as extended families and communal gathering places for generations of Ybor City residents. El Centro Espa√±ol de Tampa The clubs were open to those of particular descent: the Italian Club for Italians, El Centro Espa√±ol for Spaniards, and so on. Two notable situations were the existence of two distinct clubs for Cubans and the spinoff club founded by northern Spaniards, El Centro Asturiano. Though racism among the residents of Ybor City was not generally an issue,\\"100 Years of Ybor City\\" it was situated in the American Deep South in the era of Jim Crow, so its organizations had to follow the segregationist laws of Tampa. Ybor's Cuban immigrants were often racially mixed, and skin tones within families might cover a range of human colorations. Local law, however, required that darker-skinned and lighter- skinned people not socialize publicly. Circulo Cubano (Cuban Club) Ybor City's Cuban community organized two main clubs: La Union Mart√≠-Maceo for darker- skinned Cubans and Circulo Cubano for those with lighter skin. This was especially awkward when members of the same family had different shades of skin and were required to join different clubs, but it was the law at the time. Not surprisingly in that era, the members of Mart√≠-Maceo found acceptance and upward mobility harder to achieve in the larger Anglo community than their white Cuban counterparts. And when the 1960s federal Urban Renewal program attempted to redevelop Ybor City, their club building was the only one to be demolished. Sign on current Marti-Maceo building El Centro Asturiano was founded by immigrants from Asturias, a province of northern Spain, who split from the Centro Espa√±ol and formed a Tampa branch of El Centro Asturiano Club of Havana. However, unlike the other clubs, membership was soon opened to all people of Latin descent who wanted to join. Because of this and the fact that the club built a well-respected hospital, it consistently had the largest membership of all the clubs. Ybor cigar rollers ply their craft c.1920. Note Lector on elevated reading platform, background right =El Lector= One tradition that the tabaqueros brought with them from cigar factories in Cuba was that of El Lector (The Reader). Because the job of rolling cigar after cigar could become monotonous, the workers wanted something to occupy and stimulate the mind. Thus arose the tradition of \\"lectors\\", who sat perched on an elevated platform in the cigar factory, reading to the workers. Typically, the lector would start the day reading local Spanish newspapers and some fiction, such as a romance or adventure novel. Since most residents of Ybor were very interested in politics, the lector would then usually move on to political treatises or writings about the current events in Cuba or Spain or other countries. In the afternoon, the selection was often a literary novel, such as Don Quixote or other works of classic literature. (In Nilo Cruz's Pulitzer Prize-winning play Anna in the Tropics set in Ybor City, Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is read.) Because of the lector system, even cigar workers who could not read were exposed to classic literature and were conversant on political philosophy and current events both in Ybor City and around the world. Lectors were well respected and often highly educated. Most could look at text written in English or Italian and read it aloud in Spanish, the language of the factories. The lectors were hired and fired by the tabaqueros, not the factory owners. Their salary was paid directly by the workers through a small deduction from everyone's weekly earnings. Despite the cost, the tabaqueros enthusiastically sustained the lector tradition. Most factory owners were less supportive. They felt that the lectors stirred up their workforce by fostering \\"radical ideas\\". News of labor conditions or problems in other locations, especially, led to worker walkouts and protests on many occasions. More than one owner tried to ban lectors from his factory floor, leading to bitter strikes as the employees fought for the right to have a lector. The lectors would remain fixtures in Tampa's cigar factories until 1921, when several owners negotiated the removal of the lectors as part of an agreement to end a labor strike. At the end of a particularly bitter strike in 1931, workers in all Ybor City and West Tampa cigar factories were forced to agree to the removal of lectors Some of the lectors continued to speak to the cigar workers in other ways. Victoriano Manteiga, for example, founded La Gaceta, a tri-lingual (English, Spanish, and Italian) newspaper which is still published by his grandson in Tampa. Some took other jobs, becoming teachers or regular tabaqueros. Some went to Cuba to seek lector positions in factories which still allowed the practice. =Organized Crime= Bolita was an illegal lottery game run by organized criminals that was very popular in Tampa, especially Ybor City, during the first half of the 20th century. The game operated openly and with virtual impunity thanks to regular bribes and kickbacks to key local politicians and law enforcement officials. Charlie Wall, a member of a prominent \\"Anglo\\" Tampa family and son of a former mayor, organized bolita into an extremely profitable business in the late 1920s, and his organization soon diversified into bootlegging, casino gambling, prostitution, and other illegal ventures from his base of operations in Ybor City.http://www.sptimes.com/2006/05/09/Floridian/Cigar_city_confidenti.shtml The 1930s were a time of rampant corruption in Tampa, with many accusations of stolen elections and mayors on the payrolls of rival organized crime factions. After a time known locally as the \\"Era of Blood\\" in which local criminal interests fought over control, Santo Trafficante, Sr. pushed Wall aside and emerged as Tampa and Ybor City's leading crime boss in the 1940s. Later, his son Santo Trafficante, Jr. allegedly extended the family's influence far beyond the area. This era of rampant corruption wound down with increased federal law enforcement efforts beginning in the 1950s. Although few of the resulting trials resulted in convictions and some mob-related activity continued, the sense of lawlessness in Ybor City and Tampa in general gradually diminished. Decline =The Depression Era= The markedly decreased demand for cigars during the Great Depression of the 1930s had serious consequences for Ybor City. Many smokers found themselves unable to afford luxury items and switched to cheaper cigarettes, weakening the neighborhood's dominant industry and starting the area on a slow economic and social decline. As occurred elsewhere, many businesses laid off workers or closed altogether and many banks failed. To help keep food on the table during hard times, many residents of Ybor City plowed under their yards or vacant lots to plant vegetables and bought cows, goats, and chickens to provide milk, eggs, and meat for the family, with any surplus sold around town. The descendants of those chickens still roam the area. Tampa and the Spanish Civil War During the Spanish Civil War of 1936‚Äì39, the cry of \\"No pasaran!\\" energized Ybor City much as the cause of Cuba Libre had done so 40 years previously. The community overwhelmingly supported the democratically elected government of Republican Spain in its fight against the fascist uprising led by General Franco, and many residents donated 10% of their salary and tons of old clothes to the Republican cause.Excerpt from \\"Hard Times\\" by Studs Terkel A cigar worker turned the slogan of the Republicans, No pasaran! (They shall not pass!), into a song which was sung at rallies in both Tampa and in Spain,https://www.scribd.com/doc/7660166/The-Volunteer-July-2000 and a handful of the most ardent supporters joined the fighting as members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.Journal of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade The news that Franco's forces had triumphed in 1939 was crushing news in Ybor City. Besides the disappointment about the failure of a fervently supported cause, the end of the war cut many ties between Spanish residents of Ybor City and their mostly Republican families back in Spain. In some cases, their relatives had been killed, either during the war or in Franco's post-war purge of political opponents. In other cases, Franco's tightening control and the coming of World War II made communication difficult or impossible. In either case, links back to the mother country, which had been waning as the second generation of Ybor City residents came of age, were further weakened. =Post World War II= After World War II, the slow decline of the neighborhood which had begun in the early 1930s accelerated, as veterans returning home from service found a neighborhood with little economic opportunity and little prospects for improvement, leading many to relocate outside of Ybor City. Several factors played a role in that process. For one, the worldwide demand for cigars had not returned to pre-Depression levels, and many factories that had closed in the 1930s remained shuttered and empty. By 1945, the cigar industry in Tampa employed less than half the number of the workers than it had in 1935, when the Depression had already decreased the workforce from the peak level of 1929. The quantity and quality of jobs in the cigar industry would continue to fall as Tampa's manufacturers underwent a near-universal shift to mechanization. Replacing traditional hand-rolled cigars with machine- made varieties allowed cigar firms to employ fewer workers and pay them less. Even when demand quickly increased to record levels during American's post-war boom, the number of workers employed in Ybor City's factories continued to decrease due to more efficient machines. By then, Tampa's economy was buoyed by other industries such as shipping and tourism. However, little new activity had replaced cigar manufacturing in Ybor City, and job seekers often had to look elsewhere for employment. Another issue in Ybor City after World War II was the aging of the area's housing stock. New construction had all but stopped during the Depression and the war, and thousands of homes built during the neighborhood's era of rapid growth around 1900 were still in use. These old wooden structures were becoming dilapidated and were thus not particularly attractive to first-time home buyers such as returning veterans, who tended to gravitate to West Tampa or the booming suburbs of Tampa.Living in America: 100 Years of Ybor City The Veterans Administration encouraged this trend by offering mortgage loans on new homes at very favorable rates to returning vets. Since there were few new homes or empty lots for new construction available in Ybor City, veterans who wanted a VA loan were also pushed to buy elsewhere. Finally, the G.I. Bill made it possible for many Ybor City-born veterans to get a college education and start a career outside of the dying local cigar industry. While many of these eventually settled back in Tampa after finishing school, few could find suitable employment in their old neighborhood and relocated as well. For all these reasons, Ybor City's WWII generation was the first to leave the area in large numbers since Vicente Martinez-Ybor had first cleared the scrubland in 1885.  Urban Renewal  Empty lot in Ybor City The period from the late 1950s to the early 1970s saw two seemingly contradictory trends in Ybor City history. While the neighborhood was dying, two of its native sons, Nick Nuccio and Dick Greco, became the first \\"Latins\\" to serve as mayor of Tampa. Despite this newfound political clout, Ybor City stagnated and declined. As its cigar industry continued to consolidate, mechanize, and cut workforce, its population steadily moved to other parts of Tampa (especially West Tampa) or out of the Tampa area altogether. The Federal Urban Renewal Program of the 1960s were supposed to revitalize Ybor City with new residences and businesses designed to attract tourists to \\"Tampa's Latin Quarter\\" (a nod to the French Quarter in New Orleans). Thousands of remaining residents were forced to move as entire blocks of old homes, business, and cigar factories were razed. Due to a lack of funds and political will, however, the replacement construction never took place, and old buildings were replaced by empty lots. Another blow was the construction of Interstate 4, which cut east‚Äìwest across the approximate center of the neighborhood. Besides resulting in the demolition of even more homes and other structures, the highway cut most of the north‚Äìsouth routes through the area.  Cuban embargo  Ybor City's cigar industry had been in decline for years by the early 1960s, but the most serious blow of all came in February 1962, when rising tensions between Fidel Castro's Cuban government and the United States led to an embargo on all imports from Cuba, including tobacco. Faced with the sudden end of the supply of \\"Havana clear\\" tobacco leaves that had long been used to make the vast majority of Tampa cigars, many cigar manufacturing operations shut down, further damaging Ybor City's economy and prompting more residents to leave the neighborhood. An era had come to an end, and the neighborhood became a collection of vacant cigar factories, empty storefronts, and deserted sidewalks. Decline of the mutual aide societies With the emptying of Ybor City in the 1950s and 1960s and the passing away of the first generations of immigrants, membership in Ybor City's mutual aide societies declined, and the clubs' offerings and amenities fell accordingly. By the 21st Century, most survive as archival projects with very few members or services. The German-American Club shut down due to anti-German sentiments before World War II. Its building was used by the Young Men's Hebrew Association for several decades, and was subsequently purchased and remodeled by the city of Tampa in the late 1990s for city office space.Historical marker El Centro Espa√±ol ceased most operations in the late 1980s. After sitting vacant for several years, its building on 7th Ave. was restored and is now part of the Centro Ybor shopping/entertainment complex, and its branch clubhouse in West Tampa was partially restored to house the Hillsborough Education Foundation.\\"New Life for an Old Building\\" - Tampa Bay Magazine, Sept./Oct. 1990 The original home of the Marti-Maceo Club was demolished in 1965 by Urban Renewal (sardonically referred to as \\"Urban Removal\\" by its members) and the club is now housed in a former firehouse on 7th Avenue. The remaining clubs have greatly reduced their benefits and focus most of their resources on preserving their history and buildings. The Cuban Club, Centro Asturiano, and Italian Club buildings have been at least partially restored using club dues, various fund raisers, rental fees on their ballrooms and theaters, and preservation grants.\\"Hillsborough County agrees to help historic halls\\" - St. Pete Times = Empty lots, empty plans = With the local cigar industry collapsing and federal redevelopment funds drying up by the late 1960s, local leaders struggled to find ways to revitalize the historic Ybor City neighborhood. Several proposals sought to convert vacant land and buildings into urban residences, shopping areas, or tourist attractions. For example, Mayor Dick Greco suggested digging canals and importing gondolas to create an attraction that simulated Venice, Italy. Another idea was a 1967 scheme to convert the center of the neighborhood into an \\"Old Spain\\"-themed attraction enclosed in a medieval \\"walled city\\" and featuring \\"bloodless\\" bullfighting. Organizers staged an exhibition bullfight, but the bull escaped and had to be killed by a sheriff's deputy with a high- powered rifle. The theme park proposal died along with the bull. Due to a lack of money and popular support, none of these ideas got past the planning stages. By the early 1970s, very few businesses and residents remained in the formerly bustling commercial center of Ybor City around 7th Avenue, most notably the Columbia Restaurant The northern portion of the neighborhood (now known as V.M. Ybor), which had been separated by I-4, still had a substantial population, but a clear demographic shift had occurred. The area changed from a predominately middle-class Latino neighborhood to one that was predominately working poor and African American. Urban Renewal had not touched northern Ybor City, and a majority of residents lived in decaying small homes which had been built for new immigrants in the early 1900s. Redevelopment Statue of Vicente Martinez Ybor in Centro Ybor Centro Espa√±ol Club, now part of Centro Ybor Starting in the late 1980s, an influx of artists seeking interesting and inexpensive studio quarters began converting long-vacant storefronts along 7th Avenue into studio and gallery space, leading to a period of commercial gentrification. By the early 1990s, many of these same old brick buildings on 7th Avenue had been converted into bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and other nightlife attractions.Seizing The Day , The Tampa Tribune, March 27, 2005. The crowds grew until portions of the old neighborhood became a nighttime carnival, especially on weekends. The city built parking garages and closed 7th Ave. to traffic to deal with the growth in visitors. F. Lorenzo cigar factory in Ybor City Despite the positive aspects, some residents and leaders became concerned about the disruption from the revelry and traffic. Since around 2000, the City of Tampa has encouraged a broader emphasis in development. A family-oriented shopping complex and movie theater (Centro Ybor) has opened in the former Centro Espa√±ol social club. New apartments, condominiums and a hotel have been built on the empty lots, along with residences and hotels now occupying restored buildings. In 2009, IKEA opened Florida's largest IKEA store on 22nd Street just north of the Selmon Expressway. People were moving back to the area around once-vibrant 7th Avenue for the first time in many years. The recovery has not impacted different portions of historic Ybor City equally nor at the same rate. While the once- abandoned commercial district south of Interstate 4 underwent much redevelopment during the 1990s, populated areas north of I-4 and east of 22nd St. did not. Despite years of public and private attempts to spur economic growth, urban decay and high poverty have long been widespread in this area, with many residents still living in former cigar workers' homes built almost a century ago. From 2000 to 2009, gentrification and redevelopment slowly began to spread to the current V.M. Ybor neighborhood locatednorth and west of the Ybor City Historic District. During the period, the poverty rate in this area dropped from over 40% to about 13%. Most Tampa cigar factories were made of wood and by 2018, only two such structures remained: the Oliva factory, totally renovated and converted into apartments, and the Salvador Rodriguez Co. on 22nd St. S. in the Palmetto Beach area, now an office building. One of last wooden cigar factories reopening soon as Ybor City apartments The local museum is the Ybor City Museum State Park in the former Ferlita Bakery building (originally La Joven Francesca) building on 9th Avenue. Tours of the gardens and the \\"casitas\\" (small homes of cigar company workers) are provided by a ranger. Exhibits, period photos and a video cover the founding of Ybor City and the cigar making industry.Visit the Museum In July 2018 the Tampa Bay Rays announced their plans to build their new stadium in Ybor city. In December 2018 the team announced that the Ybor City location was no longer viable.

Philip Chetwinde (fl. 1653‚Äì1674) was a seventeenth-century London bookseller and publisher, noted for his publication of the Third Folio of Shakespeare's plays.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 98. A rough start Chetwinde was originally a clothworker. Through his 1637 marriage to Mary Allot, the widow of Second Folio publisher Robert Allot, Chetwinde acquired rights to Allot's published works ‚Äì which included the rights to a substantial portion of the dramatic output of both Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Chetwinde attempted to move into the publishing business after his marriage; but he faced opposition from the established booksellers and publishers, since he had not risen through the apprentice system of the Stationers Company. Chetwinde used his rights to Jonson's works in the publication of the Second Jonson folio of 1640/1, though that volume's publisher of record was Richard Meighen.W. P. Williams, \\"Chetwin, Crooke, and the Jonson Folios,\\" Studies in Bibliography 30 (1977), pp. 75‚Äì95. It was not until 1653 that Chetwinde was able to operate fully as a stationer. Shakespeare In 1663, he employed his rights to Shakespeare's plays to publish the Third Folio, a corrected reprint of the Second Folio of 1632. The Third Folio was printed by Alice Warren, Roger Daniel, and either Thomas Ratcliffe or John Hayes.Andrew Murphy, Shakespeare in Print: A History and Chronology of Shakespeare Publishing, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2003; p. 53. (In the seventeenth century and earlier, the functions of printers and publishers were largely [though not absolutely] separate; booksellers chose works to publish and commissioned printers to print them.) In the following year, 1664, Chetwinde issued a second impression of the Third Folio, to which he added seven plays: Locrine, The London Prodigal, The Puritan, Sir John Oldcastle, Thomas Lord Cromwell, A Yorkshire Tragedy, and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Only the last of these, Pericles, is accepted by the modern critical consensus as, even in part, authentically Shakespearean in authorship; the other six are part of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. Career Like virtually all the publishers of his time and place, Chetwinde produced an abundant supply of religious works; Bishop Bayly's The Practice of Piety, which Chetwinde issued in multiple editions, is only one example. Chetwinde was unusual among London publishers of his generation in that he published books in the Welsh language. It can be noted that Chetwinde worked, with some frequency, with female printers ‚Äì the widows of printers who had continued their late husbands' businesses. Alice Warren, as noted, worked on the Third Folio; some of Chetwinde's Welsh-language books were printed by Ellen Cotes and Sarah Griffin.

The route of the new railroad (one of the oldest railroads in North America) was built on land acquired from Peter Chardon Brooks, who sold a strip for the right-of-way plus a parcel for the station on High Street. The initial stop was called \\"Medford Gates\\"; it gave birth to West Medford Square and, eventually, the surrounding residential neighborhoods. The depot structure built in 1880 was destroyed by a fire in 1950. The finial from the roof of the station now resides today at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. In 2019, the MBTA listed West Medford as a \\"Tier I\\" accessibility priority.

Education and Experience As a youth, Linn attended Poly Prep Country Day School. He earned a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1965. He was a patent examiner, United States Patent and Trademark Office from 1965 to 1968. He earned a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center in 1969. Linn served as a patent adviser in the Office of Naval Research of the Naval Air Systems Command from 1971 to 1972. He specialized in patent and intellectual property law in private practice at the law firms of Marks & Murase, and Foley & Lardner. Federal judicial service Linn was nominated by President Bill Clinton on September 28, 1999, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated by Judge Giles Rich. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 19, 1999, and received commission on November 22, 1999. He was sworn in on January 1, 2000. He assumed senior status on October 31, 2012.

Linn was a founding member of the Board of Governors of the Virginia State Bar Section on Patent, Trademark and Copyright Law. He received the Rensselaer Alumni Association Fellows Award in 2000.  Linn Inn Alliance  Linn became actively involved in the American Inns of Court movement upon joining the Federal Circuit in 2000, when he began attending monthly meetings of the Giles Sutherland Rich American Inn of Court at the Federal Circuit. Linn later served a term as President of the Giles Rich Inn. The Richard Linn American Inn of Court was formed in Chicago on the initiative of Olivia Luk, a lawyer who had been mentored by Linn at the Giles Rich Inn. Upon moving to Chicago, Luk found that there was no Inn of Court focused on intellectual property there, and asked for Linn's help in forming an organizing committee. The organizers later decided to name the Inn for him in honor of his contributions to intellectual property law, and the Linn Inn was chartered in 2007. The Linn Inn Alliance also began in 2007, as an alliance of the Linn Inn with the four previously-existing intellectual property focused American Inns of Court: the Giles Rich Inn, the John Lifland Inn (New Jersey), the Benjamin Franklin Inn (Philadelphia), and the San Francisco Bay Area IP Inn of Court. Expanding this alliance, Linn set out to form additional intellectual property focused Inns of Court in most major American cities, and within five years, the Tokyo IP Inn of Court became the 21st member of the Linn Inn Alliance, and the first to be formed outside the United States. Through the alliance, the IP Inns share their creative programs and allow visiting attorneys to attend meetings of sister Inns while traveling. Notable cases * NTP, Inc. v.

Instruments used include nabal (brass horn), nagak (seashell horn), and taepyeongso (shawm), with jing (gong), jabara (cymbals), and yonggo (hangul: Ïö©Í≥†; hanja: ÈæçÈºì; drum painted with dragon designs and played with mallets). This style of Korean military music is often used in the reenactment of the Guard Changing Ceremony at Seoul's Gyeongbok Palace, as well as in Deoksu Palace. A special daechwita today is under the service of the Traditional Guard Unit, Republic of Korea Army, and is the only one that also has the Ulla (small tuned gongs), Pungmul-buk and Galgo in its instrumentation. This is the same case for traditional Korean bands outside the homeland, which also have a pungmul marching percussion battery (with kkwaenggwari, janggu and pungmul-buk drums) at the rear with distinguishing uniforms between the two ensembles. Few modern bands based in schools sport bass drums together with the kwaennggwari, galgo and janggu as part of their instrumentation. Uniforms in the band are in royal gold or red and white, as these were connected in the Imperial period to the Imperial family and the armed forces.

She would also listen to regional music like carimb√≥ through the records brought by an uncle who travelled to the Amazon. She was also familiar with samba, sertaneja music, and even brega Italian music, which were available to her through a local AM radio station. In several interviews, she cites deceased samba singer Clara Nunes as an influential figure in her compositions and image. At age 14, Vanessa moved alone to Uberl√¢ndia, Minas Gerais, 1,199 km (745 miles) away from Alto Gar√ßas, to prepare for her vestibular exam, through which she intended to join a Medical school. There, she discovered that her real passion was singing, and by the following year was already performing in local clubs.

Two other songs from the album, \\"Nossa Can√ß√£o\\" and \\"Onde Ir\\", both included in the soundtrack albums of two Rede Globo telenovelas, became minor hits, reaching peak positions of 40th and 69th in the Brazilian chart, respectively. In 2004, Vanessa released her second album, titled Essa Boneca Tem Manual. The album produced the singer's first number- one hit in Brazil, the song \\"Ai, Ai, Ai\\", which also peaked at 13th in the Sweden chart. Other hits include a remix version of the same song, which reached the 3rd position in the Brazilian chart and \\"Ainda Bem\\", which reached the 21st position.

The book starts in approximately the year 2020 and follows the protracted adventures of Drake Merlin, in his quest to save his wife from a terminal brain disease, over the course of eons. Similar premises are presented in the 2006 film The Fountain, as well as the Isaac Asimov story \\"The Last Question\\". Plot summary Originally, Drake is a professional musician, with minor celebrity. When his wife Ana is diagnosed with an unspecified incurable brain disorder, Drake exhausts every option attempting to cure her. Only then does he decide to have her body cryogenically stored, in the hopes future generations will discover an effective treatment. However, Drake is extremely cautious, and in case the future culture doesn't care about her plight, he has himself frozen as well. Furthermore, he devotes all his energies for a decade before his freezing to becoming an expert primary source on the musically notable people of his era. He correctly assumes that if you become the world's foremost expert in any subject, eventually someone will want to write a book on that exact subject. At that time the hypothetical future writer will want to awaken Drake, and he can in turn awaken his wife, if treatment is available. He is awakened in the year 2512. Although society is vastly different, no cure for Ana yet exists. He spends six years apprenticed to a musical historian to pay for his reviving costs and to gain a foothold in this new world. Drake is continually laid dormant and revived, progressively later into the future, all the way until the time of the Big Crunch. Human civilization alters radically over the eons, but Ana's mangled brain proves an extremely difficult problem. Despite the incomprehensible changes surrounding in each successive awakening, Drake never loses sight of his mission. Eventually, in the extremely remote posthuman future a few billions years later, Drake's original biological body has disintegrated, despite the cryogenic treatment, and he has become an uploaded consciousness, though still in stasis. At this point the descendants of humanity have colonized the entire Milky Way galaxy, yet an inexplicable threat is wiping out their colonies in a widening arc. The leaders of this civilization have exhausted every answer they can conceive of and have zero information as to even the cause of the threat. Their last hope is Drake, an ancient holdover, who may have ideas new to them‚Äînamely, war. The main problem is that the beings have no idea what is happening because the planets wiped out seem exactly the same, but they do not respond to signals, and outside communication is impossible. All probes sent do not return, nor do they reply once they reach the surface of the planet. Drake becomes the commander of the residents of the galaxy, in designing weapons and defenses, ideas that have long vanished from the minds of these beings. At this time, their technology allows for extremely powerful and deep manipulation of matter at a fundamental scale. An experimental technology called the caesura is used as the plot device to carry the novel. It is a means of instantaneous teleportation using exotic physics, which has by now developed to a stage where it will have no meaning to the causal being. This caesura is not guaranteed teleportation but has a low chance of succeeding. Billions upon billions of copies of Drake are thus sent out to the planets on the border of the invasion, and by means of the caesura they are teleported back to the base to collect information about the threat. Eventually it is discovered that the threat is an exotic interplanetary type of plant life with spores that migrate between systems. These plants do not intentionally destroy the living beings on the planet, but as a result of their growth they do so. After the cause of the problem is found, the posthumans decide that the militant Drake is no longer needed or deemed a positive influence‚Äîhe is seen as too warlike. They tell him to merge with all the returning Drake copies, of which there are billions. This he agrees to, and over billions of years, he collates those copies‚Äîforming a collective mind of copies of himself. In one subplot, a version of himself was randomly teleported by the caesura to a distant galaxy, and he manages to return over a few billion years. Finally, the collective version of Drake resolves to use the Omega Point to gain complete knowledge of everything and to restore Ana. The story ends on an ambiguous note as Ana is potentially revived, and they seek to create a new universe by means of the caesura to live in.SF Site Reviews, Catherine Asaro. _Tomorrow & Tomorrow_. http://www.sfsite.com/06a/tomm34.htm 1997 American novels American science fiction novels 1997 science fiction novels Cryonics in fiction ","title":"Tomorrow and Tomorrow (novel)"},{"id":"13208945","text":"Russ Irwin is an American singer-songwriter, producer, composer and multi- instrumentalist from New York City.

It is located on Gardner Avenue in a small outlying area of the city, near the county fairgrounds on a small rise south of NY 211. The school, formerly Anthony Veraldi Junior High School, built in 1959, replaced the building now known as Twin Towers Middle School as the district's high school in 1976 after a major expansion. It has been expanded at least four times since then. Recent years =2000s controversies= The school has been at the center of a number of controversies in the last several years. When former district superintendent Robert Sigler was investigated and convicted in 2003 for sexually abusing a male student, then-principal Bernard Cohen was suspended by the school board (with pay) and barred from school-related events for allegedly not doing enough to prevent it, and other allegations against him. These included under reporting violence and complaints at the school (involving students, teachers and him), falsifying records in a corrupt manner, putting students who dropped out or got expelled under the \\"transferred schools\\" category, and last but not least, unethically accepting money and/or other bribes and favors in return for getting students diplomas who didn't meet NY state requirements. He claimed it was retaliation for his testimony before the county grand jury investigating the abuse and that he was being scapegoated. Students claiming to be sympathetic to him organized a protest walkout, spoke in his behalf at board meetings and then helped campaign during the ensuing elections, in which two incumbents were defeated, Cohen denied having anything to do with this. Four years later, the school district settled with Cohen for $425,000. The 2005 school year began chaotically when many students received incorrect class schedules or none at all due to problems implementing a new computer program, (some called it Cohen's revenge as he still had influence at the school) and continued as ongoing construction did not run smoothly and disrupted the school. Students again staged a walkout over a number of their concerns that they believed were not being taken seriously by the district administration, such as overcrowding and safety issues. Cohen's replacement, Larry Ashley, resigned three months into the school year, citing health problems. Later that month, the district sought to fire tenured art teacher Peter Panse, who had offered his senior students a nude figure drawing class taught off-campus as a way to improve their portfolios and chances for scholarships at art schools. Very few of his students supported him, but many claimed they had felt pressured into taking the class. The district argued Panse had a conflict of interest, since he personally profited from the students taking the class. After lengthy litigation, in January 2007 a state administrative law judge ruled that he should have been suspended for only 15 days and ordered him reinstated. The beginning of the 2007-08 school year also saw some more scheduling problems, with new textbooks ordered only the week before school opened and many teachers not knowing their own schedules. The 2007-2008 school year also started off rough. However, the MHS community came together to overcome the obstacles of the past and had the largest graduating class in 10 years. In 2008 the school opened state of the art athletic facilities, Faller Field, and opened the brand new stadium with the Erie Bell game in which Middletown was victorious over Port Jervis. The turf field is Class One FIFA approved and IAAF-certified. Student body Current enrollment at Middletown High School is 2,146 students (as of 2012), though this number is expected to increase in the coming years. The student body is made up of 946 Hispanic students, 650 black students, 489 white students, 52 Asian students, and 9 students of two or more races. The school is classified as an inner city district and high poverty district, with 63.6% of students registered for free or reduced price lunch. Middletown has 142 full-time teachers, with a student-teacher ratio of 15 to 1. Average class size at Middletown is roughly 24. Athletics The Middletown Middies football team shares a historic rivalry with the Port Jervis High School Red Raiders, named the Erie Bell game after the trophy, which is an old railroad bell from the Port Jervis-Middletown line. The game is an alternating home-and-away series and started in 1897. Middletown leads the series 72-58-7 as of 2015, and has won three of the last four games. Beginning in 2014, the game is on the list of U.S. Marines Great American Rivalry games. Middletown's boys basketball team is highly regarded in the state, and during the 2011-2012 school year the team went to the final four of the state playoffs. The Middies returned to the playoffs in 2015-2016, making the state finals and losing to Aquinas Institute. The team has a rivalry with the NFA Goldbacks from nearby Newburgh. Middletown's track and field team is nationally recognized and has produced a number of successful college athletes and state and national qualifiers. The boys 4x400 meter relay team won a national championship in 2011. However, there is no greater sport in the high school than the Middletown Softball Team. Home to aces Jazmyn Martinez and Allison Marcano, as well as homerun hitter Elivia Perez, the underdog team went from a 1 and 19 season in 2011 to a section appearance in 2012 , making the section tourney every consecutive year since then. Since 2012 they have managed to have a winning record each year, and won the Section 9 Championship in 2016. They host the championship in 2017.

In many countries it is offered as an optional subject in some secondary schools and universities, and may be compulsory for students in certain institutions or following certain courses. For those wishing to learn the language independently, there are printed and online resources. For the most part, the language is treated as a written language in formal instruction; however, the Living Latin movement advocates teaching it also through speaking and listening. Philosophical aims Although Latin was once the universal academic language in Europe, academics no longer use it for writing papers or daily discourse. Furthermore, the Roman Catholic Church, as part of the Vatican II reforms in the 1960s, modernized its religious liturgies to allow less use of Latin and more use of vernacular languages. Nonetheless, the study of Latin has remained an academic staple into the 21st century. Most of the Latin courses currently offered in secondary schools and universities are geared toward translating historical texts into modern languages, rather than using Latin for direct oral communication. As such, they primarily treat Latin as a written dead language, although some works of modern literature such as Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe, Paddington Bear, Winnie the Pooh, The Adventures of Tintin, Asterix, Harry Potter, Le Petit Prince, Max und Moritz, Peter Rabbit, Green Eggs and Ham, and The Cat in the Hat have been translated into Latin in order to promote interest in the language. =Living Latin= Conversely, proponents of the Living Latin movement believe that Latin can be taught in the same way that modern \\"living\\" languages are taught, i.e. by incorporating oral fluency and listening comprehension as well as textual skills. This approach offers speculative and stylistic insight into how ancient authors spoke and incorporated sounds of the language, as patterns in Latin poetry and literature can be difficult to identify without an understanding of the sounds of words. Living Latin can be seen in action in Schola , a social networking site where all transactions are in Latin, including conversations in real-time in the site's locutorium (chatroom). Institutions that offer Living Latin instruction include the Vatican and the University of Kentucky. In Great Britain, the Classical Association encourages this approach, and Latin language books describing the adventures of a mouse called Minimus have been published. The Latinum podcast, teaching conversational Classical Latin, is also broadcast from London. There are several websites offering Nuntii Latini (Latin News) which usually cover international matters: in Finland (weekly), in Bremen/Germany (monthly), and on Radio Vatican . In the United States, the National Junior Classical League (with more than 50,000 members) encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin, and the National Senior Classical League encourages college students to continue their studies of the language. =Influence on artificial languages= Many international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by Latin; the successful language Interlingua considers itself a modernized and simplified version of the language. Latino sine Flexione is a language created from Latin with its inflections dropped, that laid claim to a sizable following in the early 20th century. Curriculum requirements in Australia Latin is not offered by the mainstream curriculum; however it is offered in many high schools as an elective subject. Many schools, particularly private schools, offer many languages in year 7 to expose the student to languages as possible electives; Latin is often among these introductory languages. Alternatively, many universities or colleges offer the subject for students should they desire to study it. Curriculum requirements in Europe =Belgium= Dutch- speaking regions Latin is optionally taught. Most students can choose Latin as one of the two majors. Other majors may be Greek, maths, science, humane sciences or modern languages. Almost one third of \\"ASO\\" students learn Latin for a number of years. Francophone regions Latin is optionally taught in secondary schools. =France= Latin is optionally studied in French secondary schools. =Germany= In Germany Latin is a choice for the compulsory second language at the Gymnasium (main secondary school preparing for university entry), usually together with French and sometimes Spanish, Russian etc. Nearly one third of students at the Gymnasiumhttp://www.spiegel.de/schulspiegel/wissen/untote-sprache-jeder- dritte-gymnasiast-bimst-latein-a-503814.html Der Spiegel , lookup 11-6-2014 learn Latin for a number of years,There are three levels of certificates, requiring different numbers of periods: Kleines (small) Latinum, Latinum, Gro√ües (big) Latinum and a Latin certificate (\\"Latinum\\") is a requirement for various university courses. It is the third most popular language learnt in school after English and French, ahead of Spanish or Russian. In some regions, especially majority-Catholic ones such as Bavaria, it is still very popular, to the point that more than 40% of all grammar school students study Latin. However, in Eastern Germany where educational traditions were broken during the communist period, it does not command much popularity. =Greece= The teaching of Latin has a very long history in Greece. Latin is today compulsory for high school students who wish to study law, social and political sciences and humanities, and is one of the four subjects tested in Greek examinations for entry into university-level courses in these fields. In high school, the subject is taught in a very detailed manner that has provoked criticisms. =Ireland= Latin until recently was quite popular in secondary schools. Latin is now not widely taught, but can be taken as an optional subject in some secondary schools. =Italy= In Italy, Latin is compulsory in secondary schools such as the Liceo Classico and Liceo Scientifico, which are usually attended by people who aim to the highest level of education. In liceo classico, which is the school that was historically attended by the Ruling class, Ancient Greek is a compulsory subject too. Italian high schools other than liceo classico and liceo scientifico normally do not include the subjects Latin and Ancient Greek. About one third of Italian high school graduates (19-year-olds) have taken Latin for five years. Latin is also taught at the Accademia Vivarium Novum. Around 40 percent of Italian high school students study Latin at high school for five years.http://www.flcgil.it/rassegna- stampa/nazionale/corriere-latino-italia-record-lo-studiano-4-su-10.flc Latin courses comprises a quite high number of weekly periods, and this contributes to make Italian schooling system somewhat different from other countries', where only a negligible number of students decides to take Latin courses at high school. In Italy, Latin and Ancient Greek are considered important because they are believed to help the students learn an effective study method. In Italy, it is also believed to \\"open the students' minds\\" (as people say) i.e., to make them more skilled and more intelligent, even though there is no conclusive statistical evidence for this. Due to words overlaps between Latin and Italian, and sometimes even in English, it is believed that students of Latin have a wider vocabulary in the fields of science, literature, law, philosophy,and also in foreign language(Spanish, French, Portuguese, English, Romanian). Some content that, Latin and Ancient Greek courses may reduce the remaining weekly periods devoted to any other course one can deem more important https://www.ilfoglio.it/bandiera-bianca/2016/11/01/news/i-dati-che- smontano-la-presunta-superiorita-del-liceo- classico-106074/http://noisefromamerika.org/articolo/aboliamo-classico Latin and Ancient Greek courses at high school comprise both grammar and literature. Grammar is normally analysis of the text given, and this, among other things, is supposed to improve the students' language skills. Inside liceo classico and liceo scientifico, the almost daily translation of short texts from Latin and Ancient Greek usually takes the most part of the daily time devoted by each student to homework. studied in the first two years of high school. Literature is studied in the remaining three years. Students are also assigned daily homework consisting of translating short texts from Latin and Ancient Greek (in Italian, they are called versione di latino and versione di greco respectively). Students are taught to carry out a translation assignment following a strict semantic analysis. The translation of short texts from Latin and Ancient Greek has been compared by Italian physicist Guido Tonelli to \\"scientific research\\" and it is said to be a useful mental exercise. Italian schooling system has received both praises and criticism. It has also been suggested that it should be revised to meet the needs of the contemporary era, mainly because it is very different from other successful schooling systems, such as those of Finland and the United States. Despite the efforts of Italian politicians to reform it, very little changed when it comes to Latin and Ancient Greek. http://noisefromamerika.org/articolo/aboliamo- classico Inside Italian schools, the pronunciation adopted by teachers is normally that of New Latin. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands, Latin is (together with Ancient Greek) compulsory at the highest variant of secondary education, the gymnasium - both languages for at least the first three years. After that, the pupils can choose either to keep only Latin, or to keep only Greek, or to keep both classical languages in their curriculum for three more years. =Poland= Latin is a non-compulsory foreign language that students of some high schools can choose to learn. Latin language and the culture of antiquity is also one of the extra examinations a high school graduate may take during their matura. Latin language is a compulsory subject for students of law, medicine, veterinary and language studies. =Spain= Latin is a compulsory subject for all those who study humanities (students can select from three sorts of study: sciences, humanities or a mixture) in grades 11 and 12. =Switzerland= Since the 1980s when about half of all Gymnasium (grammar school, type of secondary leading to university entry) students had Latin, the language took a deep dip. After modest recovery in the past years about one fifth of all students at the Gymnasium nowadays take some years of Latin. There are regional differences: whereas in few cantons like Uri the language is not being taught any more, in Appenzell, Graub√ºnden und Glarus and Z√ºrich around 40% of Gymnasium students take Latin.NZZ 21.09.2014 \\"Latein ist beliebter als angenommen\\" =United Kingdom= In the first half of the 20th century, Latin was taught in approximately 25% of schools. However, from the 1960s, universities gradually began to abandon Latin as an entry requirement for Medicine and Law degrees. After the introduction of the Modern Language General Certificate of Secondary Education in the 1980s, Latin began to be replaced by other languages in many schools. Latin is still taught in a small number, particularly private schools. Three British exam boards offer Latin, OCR, SQA and WJEC. In 2006, it was dropped by the exam board AQA. =Other countries= In Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Austria, Republic of Macedonia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania, Latin is studied at high school level as compulsory or optional subject. It is compulsory in Gymnasium high school programs. In Portugal, Latin is also studied. In Finland, Latin is studied at a small minority of high schools. Curriculum requirements in North America =Canada= Latin is occasionally provided in a small number of Canadian secondary schools, usually studied as an elective. =United States= In the United States, Latin is occasionally taught in high schools and middle schools, usually as an elective or option. There is, however, a growing classical education movement consisting of private schools and home schools that are teaching Latin at the elementary or grammar school level. Latin is often taught in Catholic secondary schools, and in some of them it is a required course. More than 149,000 Latin students took the 2007 National Latin Exam. In 2006, 3,333 students took the AP Latin Literature exam. There is also a National Latin Exam administered to students in the U.S. and other countries. Curriculum requirements in South America =Chile= Latin is not a compulsory subject in school, and it is presented as optional in very few secondary schools. However, many universities impart Latin as a compulsory subject for the students of Philosophy, Literature, Linguistics, Theology and sometimes Law. =Venezuela= In Venezuela Latin is taught as a compulsory subject in the branch of humanities of the bachillerato for two years. Bachillerato is a segment of secondary education similar to American high schools and is divided into two branches: sciences and humanities. Students learn Latin grammar in their first year of study, then construct and translate Latin texts in the second year.Duque Arellano, Jos√© Gonzalo Pertinencia y vigencia del lat√≠n en la ense√±anza de la lengua espa√±ola, en las √°reas de la morfolog√≠a y de la sintaxis ; Universidad de los Andes At university level, the University of the Andes offers a degree program for Letras Menci√≥n Lengua y Literaturas Cl√°sicas (Classical Languages and Literatures). In this program (the only one of its type in Venezuela), the students learn Latin, Ancient Greek and the literature of both languages for five years. Detalle de la Carrera: \\"Letras Menci√≥n Lengua y Literaturas Clasicas\\" ; CNU-OPSU: Oportunidades de Estudio de Educaci√≥n Superior en Venezuela In other Venezuelan universities, Latin is a compulsory subject of the program for Letras (Hispanic Literature) and Educaci√≥n, menci√≥n: Castellano y Literatura (Education of Spanish language and Hispanic Literature). Latin is also taught in Roman Catholic seminaries. Curriculum requirements in Asia =Mainland China and Taiwan= Latin was one of the things which were taught by the Jesuits. A school was established by them for this purpose. A diplomatic delegation found a local who composed a letter in fluent Latin. Latin is a rare language in Asia, including Taiwan. There are fewer than five universities offering Latin curriculum. As a Catholic university, Fu Jen University is the most important school to offer the Latin curriculum in Taiwan. It offers short-term Latin courses with dormitory in summer vacation and even attracts many students from mainland China. In China many universities offer Latin courses. At Beijing Foreign Studies University since 2009 there is a Centre for Latin Studies called Latinitas Sinica. Independent study A number of people interested in Latin do not have access to formal instruction. In many countries, Latin has fallen out of favour in schools and colleges. As a result, there is a growing demand for resources allowing people to study Latin independently. Online study groups offer a certain degree of guidance to independent learners. The beginners' textbook Wheelock's Latin is particularly well-adapted to independent study because of its clear and comprehensive instructions, its numerous exercises, the included answer key, and the wealth of supplementary and third-party aids adapted to the textbook. Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata by Hans Henning √òrberg is an instructional book that teaches Latin entirely in Latin. A teacher‚Äôs guide and other support materials are available, including a spoken version of the book. There is useful public domain material online for learning Latin, including old school textbooks, readers, and grammars such as Meissner's Latin Phrasebook. There are also a number of online courses, such as Avitus' Schola Latina Universalis and Molendinarius' Latin-only YouTube course, Cursum Latinum, and the Latinum Podcast.

If you insert a 10 crown coin into the slot, the biggest hit song of Milan Hlavsa, , will start playing. Milan \\"Mejla\\" Hlavsa (Prague, March 6, 1951 ‚Äì January 5, 2001) was the founder, chief songwriter, and original bassist of the Czech band Plastic People of the Universe, which was part of the inspiration for the anti-establishment movement Charter 77.  Biography  =Early life and musical exposure= Milan Hlavsa was born on March 6, 1951 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. His father was employed as a bank clerk. Hlavsa himself labored as a butcher's apprentice before he founded the Plastic People of the Universe (PPU) in 1968. Due to oppression by Czechoslovakia's communist regime, access to Western music was limited. Native Czechs maintained a link to the Western music world by obtaining albums from friends and family abroad. This is how a young Hlavsa developed an affinity for American rock and roll. He was also a part of the movement called m√°niƒçky. =The formation of the Plastic People= In 1967, a friend of Hlavsa's introduced him to the music of The Velvet Underground. They would prove to be a tremendous influence, along with the music of Frank Zappa. At the time, Hlavsa was in a band known as The Primitives. In 1968, Hlavsa abandoned The Primitives and joined with Michal Jernek, Ji≈ô√≠ ≈†tevich and Josef Brabec to form the Plastic People of the Universe. =Social impact= In 1970, two years after the Plastic People of the Universe were formed, the government stripped them of their professional license. Without this, they were unable to play legally. To circumvent the system, the members of the PPU took jobs working in the forest. They continued to perform despite minor skirmishes with the police. That year, the PPU were members of a festival that promoted \\"druh√° kultura\\", or second culture. The communist regime denounced the festival, arrested the members of the PPU, and tried them on various charges. Three members were jailed, and a former member (Canadian Paul Wilson) was deported. Hlavsa, the founding member, was the only one who escaped without a sentence. It was the arrest and trial of the PPU that would convince V√°clav Havel, along with others, to take action against the communist government. Their efforts would culminate in the organization Charter 77, which aimed to persuade the government to follow the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the Helsinki Accords, both of which the government had signed. This organization would be one of the most prominent dissident societies to arise in Czechoslovakia in opposition to the communist government.Stokes, Gale. The Walls Came Tumbling Down. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. Following their release from prison, the PPU would continue to perform discreetly until the government permitted them to play publicly in 1988. =Hiatus, P≈Ølnoc, and reuniting the Plastic People= In 1988, the Czech government ended its 18-year-old policy of suppressing the PPU and allowed them to perform publicly. Unfortunately, the band split up soon afterwards. Hlavsa formed a new group called P≈Ølnoc (which means \\"midnight\\" in Czech). The band included PPU keyboardist Josef Jan√≠ƒçek and violist Ji≈ô√≠ Kabe≈°. P≈Ølnoc released _City of Hysteria_ in the United States on Arista Records in 1991. In 1997, at Havel's suggestion, Hlavsa reunited with the other Plastic People of the Universe and performed a series of concerts to mark the 20th anniversary of Charter 77, the Czech declaration of human rights. In 1999, the PPU performed at the White House along with Lou Reed. =Death= On January 5, 2001, Hlavsa died of lung cancer. He was 49 years old.

He died soon afterwards at La Sisla and was buried in the monastic cemetery there. His community at Lupiana recorded their memories of him as a pious and dedicated monk. Apparently his preference was to study and work at night, so he was rarely to be seen in daytime.

The revolt had the support of several Visigothic counts, all Arians probably, but not rebelling necessarily out of devotion to their theological principles. The low-level conspirators were deprived of their property and offices and sent into exile, but one of the chief rebels, Vagrila, took refuge in the basilica of Saint Eulalia. Claudius was told, upon request, to give Vagrila, his family, and his possessions over to the church of M√©rida, which he did.

It was a subsidiary of the state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC).EIA (2007) Overview Agoco's roots go back to 1971 when the Arabian Gulf Exploration Company (AGECO) was established, following the implementation of Law No. 115, issued by the Libyan Revolutionary Command Council nationalizing shares held by British Petroleum (BP). Agoco was formed by the NOC in late 1979 to take over the assets of a partnership of BP and Nelson Bunker Hunt of the United States, and a partnership of Chevron and Texaco called Amoseas. Agoco has upstream operations in eight oil fields, including Sarir, Messla, Nafoora, Beda and Hammada. The company also operates an oil terminal and a refinery in Tobruk and Sarir. =Agoco Fields= The Sarir field was discovered in the Sirte Basin by BP in 1961 is considered the country's largest field.C. Lewis (1990) The Messla field was discovered in 1971 and is situated 500 km southeast of Benghazi and is also considered as one of the biggest fields in the Sirte basin. Nafoora field is situated in the northeastern part of the Sirte basin and discovered in early 1965.T. Ahlbrandt (2001) The Beda and Hamada fields were discovered during 1959, in the eastern Sirte basin and the southern border of the Grahames basin respectively. Bede and Hamada are nearly considered dead fields unless new Enhanced oil recovery technology can be implemented. Additionally, Agoco often operates fields owned by other companies. Agoco production was estimated by NOC at around in 2003. As of 2010, Agoco produced around , representing approximately 25% of total Libyan crude oil production. Refineries and Oil Terminal The Sarir refinery started operations in 1989 and has a refining capacity of . The fuel supply from the refinery meets requirements for the Sarir Agricultural Project as well as for the general area. Agoco also has a portable petroleum refinery or topping plant at Sarir. The Tobruk refinery has been on stream since 1971 and entered the production phase during 1989. In 1990, the refinery operations were transferred to Agoco after being directly managed by the NOC. In 1996, Tobruk had two thermo-compression distillation units installed to produce 750 cm/d of drinking water from the Mediterranean Sea. The General contractor for the project was United Kingdom-based Weir Westgarth Ltd., a subsidiary of the Weir Group. Currently, Tobruk has an estimated capacity of . The Marsa El Hariga Terminal (Tobruk) is situated on the southern coast of the Tobruk trading port. Construction of the terminal started in 1964, and was completed in 1966. The Marsa El Hariega oil terminal was officially inaugurated by exporting the first shipment of crude oil from Sarir in 1967. The crude from Sarir is pumped through a 400 km pipeline, with an auxiliary pumping station between Sarir and the terminal. Marsa El Hariga has three berths with a loading capacity of 8,000 tons/hour for tankers of up to . Other ancillary facilities at the terminal include oil products storage tanks with a capacity of 116,500 cubic metres. 2011 Libyan civil war The Arabian Gulf Oil Company announced plans to use oil funds to support anti-Gaddafi forces.

The battle was a huge success for the ARBiH, which was able to rout Abdiƒá's forces and occupy the territory of Western Bosnia. Fikret Abdiƒá was able to recapture the territory in December 1994 in Operation Spider.  Background  The early 1990s saw the existence of a western \\"Muslim\\" enclave held by Bosnian government forces under the leadership of the ARBiH commander, Atif Dudakoviƒá. The region was fortunate that even having some Croatian population in southwest, it was able to avoid internecine fighting between the once-allied Croatian Defence Council (HVO) forces and government Bosnian ARBiH forces that plagued central Bosnia. This was however about the only thing the western enclave had in its favour. In addition to being completely surrounded by Serbian forces with the Republic of Serbian Krajina to the west and the Bosnian Republika Srpska (VRS) to the east, the Western enclave forces had to deal with the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia and its leader Fikret Abdiƒá. =AP Western Bosnia= The Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia was a de facto independent entity that existed in the Western enclave of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1993 and 1995. Its capital city was Velika Kladu≈°a. In 1993 Fikret Abdiƒá, once the president of the Agrokomerc company, decided to carve out a little state for himself and succeeded in recruiting enough followers to make his dream a reality. Abdiƒá was able to hold power over his mini-state by using cult-like propaganda techniques over his followers and Serbian arms and military training. Local residents of Velika Kladusa were reported as treating Abdiƒá \\"like a god\\" and \\"were ready to do whatever he said.\\" =5th Corps= Even though it was totally surrounded by Serbian forces and constantly harassed by Abdiƒá's followers, the western enclave protected by the 5th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (five infantry brigades strong) was able to hold its own and achieve some success partly thanks to the leadership of Atif Dudakoviƒá. By the summer of 1994, Dudakoviƒá had developed a plan in hopes of eliminating the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia. Secret plan The plan was hatched by Dudakoviƒá and the commander of the 5th Corps 502nd Brigade, Hamdija Abdiƒá known as \\"Tigar\\" (no relation to Fikret Abdiƒá). In total secrecy, Hamdija approached Fikret Abdiƒá as a dissatisfied military commander willing to sell his services and treachery to him for the right price. Fikret Abdiƒá was suspicious but decided to take the risk and gave Hamdija a large sum of money, promising that if fighting broke out he would support Hamdija's coup attempt. Hamdija promptly informed Dudakoviƒá, who ordered that all aid workers be confined to quarters and that large fires be started using piles of tires to create the illusion of burning buildings. Then Dudakoviƒá told his dumbfounded troops to fire in the air as if they were fighting an invisible enemy. Fikret Abdiƒá and his Serbian backers, watching from a distance, saw the smoke and heard the gunfire while listening to rattled aid workers yelling over their radio channels for extraction. Assuming they were seeing a military coup in progress, they promptly sent in their best weapons, troops and officers to support Hamdija Abdiƒá. Abdiƒá had been lured into a trap, and Dudakoviƒá and the still-loyal 5th Corps were able to force the swift surrender of his forces and seize badly needed weapons. The Serbian VRS and SVK turned out Fikret Abdiƒá in a rage, and what was left of his demoralized forces had to face an attack by Dudakoviƒá's strengthened 5th Corps. They were quickly routed. The testimony of Colonel Patrick Barriot *Q.Tell me, in Krajina, at the time of the conflict between the Muslim forces in the Bihaƒá pocket, according to the information I have, is it correct that there were 40.000 Muslim refugees in Krajina? *A. Yes. I can confirm the figures. This happened during the summer of 1994. The 5th Corps of the BH army in the Bihaƒá pocket was headed by General Atif Dudakoviƒá and it launched an attack especially in the area of Velika Kladu≈°a, and it expelled up to 40.000 Muslims who were faithful to Fikret Abdiƒá. These 40.000 Muslims were expelled towards the Krajina area, and they were taken in two camps which I personally visited together with people, officials from the UNHCR. Bertrand Dupasquier was a responsible official at the time. These 40.000 people were taken in the Batnoga and Turan camps where they were taken care of with a lot of humanity by the local population in Krajina. The local population fed them but also looked after them medically speaking; if they were wounded, if they were sick, if they were women about to deliver, they were taken care of. So all these Muslims were gathered in Batnoga and Turan and they were taken care of in the Glina Hospital with total dedication. They were given blood supplies. They were helped without any kind of discrimination. And very often the few medicines, the few supplies that there were in the Glina Hospital were given to the Muslim population. *Q. These refugees, these 40.000 Muslims who came to Krajina, could they have gone to Croatia or somewhere else? *A. No. It was impossible for them to get out and to seek shelter in Krajina or elsewhere. The only opening for them or the only possibility offered to them later on was a return to the Bihac pocket early in 1995. And it is precisely in the Bihaƒá pocket that the large amount of them were massacred during the Operation Storm by the 5th Corps of the BH army, but also by Croat troops that had infiltrated in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Western Bosnia. *Q. Does that mean that there was a double standard involved in terms of treating the Muslim population itself; those who were on Alija Izetbegoviƒá's side received support whereas those who were on Fikret Abdiƒá's side were exposed to all kinds of persecution, destruction and the like? *A. I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand your question. *Q. Does that mean that the Muslims who were on the side of Fikret Abdiƒá, including these 40.000 expelled refugees, were practically victims of persecution by the Muslim and Croat forces? *A. Yes, quite. Absolutely. In 1994, it was obvious that the central authority in Sarajevo and that Izetbegoviƒá's army was trying everything possible to eliminate both Fikret Abdiƒá and to remove all the Muslims in the Bihaƒá pocket faithful to the latter. So they were exposed, and they were victims of the central authority in Sarajevo, and they also fell prey to the Croat forces which were intent on removing any kind of support to the Krajina Serbs, support by the Muslims who were in the Bihaƒá pocket. *Q. What about the authorities of the Republic of the Serbian Krajina? Was it clear to them that since these Muslims had nowhere to go that a considerable number of these people could stay on in Krajina forever? *A. Yes. In my view there was no problem whatsoever regarding taking in the Muslims in the Krajina Republic, because even before the 5th Corps was created in the Bihaƒá pocket, it was obvious and it was frequent that Muslims would come from Velika Kladu≈°a, from that area towards Glina where they were taken care of, they were looked after, and they could remain very safely in that area and also in Banovina.Colonel Patrick Barriot.Wednesday, 12 January 2005 Aftermath Fikret Abdiƒá was able to recapture the territory in December 1994 in Operation Spider. It was renamed to \\"Republic of Western Bosnia\\" in 1995. As a consequence of the 1995 Operation Storm, the Republic of Western Bosnia was dissolved, its forces defeated and its territory was incorporated into the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (present day Una- Sana Canton). Fikret Abdiƒá was arrested and after the war he was convicted for acts of war crimes against civilian Bosniaks that stayed loyal to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The government of Bosnia-Herzegovina charged him with the deaths of 121 civilians and three prisoners of war, and the wounding of 400 civilians in the Bihaƒá region. Croatia, where he had taken refuge, refused to extradite him, but he was put on trial there. In 2002 he was sentenced to 20 years in prison for war crimes committed in the area of the \\"Bihaƒá pocket\\". In 2005 the Croatian Supreme Court reduced the sentence to 15 years. Other major counterattacks by both Croatian and Bosnian forces in western Bosnia included Croatian Operation Mistral 2 (September 1995) and Bosnian Operation Sana (October 1995). Further offensives were ended by the signing of the Dayton Agreement, largely thanks to pressure from those operations and the NATO bombardment of Bosnian Serbs. The Serbian population of those areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina fled east, to Banja Luka and as far as Vojvodina and Kosovo. The United Nations estimated there were 150,000-200,000 refugees from Croatia alone. The number of refugees from western Bosnia is unknown.

Life and work As an artist, Verdizotti is mainly remembered for his friendship with Titian, whose pupil he was, and later his secretary from 1556. No painted work can be attributed with certainty to him but, judging from the prints in his \\"100 Moral Fables\\" (Cento favole morali), his speciality was small landscapes with tiny figures. There is a signed pen and ink drawing by him of Cephalus and Procris (Brunswick, Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum), which resembles Titian's graphic style. Other drawings attributed to Verdizotti are a pen and ink Landscape with Houses (Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana) and the Titian-like Study of a Tree (Madrid, Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando). He probably also executed the pen and wash drawing of \\"A Bear Devouring a Rabbit in a Landscape\\" (Florence, Uffizi), which has as motto naturam ars vincit, a work close in style to the woodcuts that illustrate his fables. Similarly, the supposed ink portrait of Titian (Haarlem, Teyler's Museum) is close to the \\"Cephalus and Procris\\".The Concise Grove Dictionary of Art, Oxford University Press 2002, online access Verdizotti's poetic work includes a translation into ottava rima of the second book of the Aeneid (1560) and a chivalric romance, Del L'Aspramonte (1594). His most celebrated work was the \\"100 Moral Fables\\", valued as much for the beauty of his woodprints as for the verse and the interesting choice of subjects. According to Ruth Mortimer,Italian 16th Century Books in the Harvard College Library, San Francisco CA 1974, p.523 he was probably influenced by Gabriele Faerno's Centum Fabulae (1563), the engravings in which are considered as being by Titian and which Verdizotti may have seen in preparation. Among Verdizotti's fables, 37 of Faerno's subjects do not appear, the rejected texts dealing mainly with men and gods. His preference is for animal fables but he also added the Biblical \\"The Trees and the Bramble\\". In 1597 Verdizotti published a prose \\"Lives of the Holy Fathers\\" (Vite de Santi Padri) in which he mentioned that he had a canonry at Castelcucco, near Treviso.

He led the ill-fated Goettge Patrol in the early days of the Guadalcanal campaign, and was killed during that operation. Biography Goettge was born in Canton, Ohio, on December 30, 1895. He enlisted in the Marine Corps during World War I in May 1917, after spending one year at Ohio University. Goettge was commissioned as a first lieutenant in 1918. During World War I, Goettge served with the 5th Marines in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and later served in occupation duty at Segendorf, Germany. Goettge c. 1921 After the war, Goettge served in a number of billets, including the 1st Provisional Brigade in Haiti, and at Headquarters of the Department of the Pacific, in San Francisco and Hawaii. In 1924, Goettge went to Quantico and was later sent to the Marine Detachment in Peking, China. In June 1933, Goettge served aboard the battleship , and then was commanding officer of the Marine detachment at Annapolis, Maryland. In June 1941, Goettge was assigned to the 1st Marine Division, and remained in that unit as division intelligence officer, until his death the following year. Goettge was known for his prowess on the football field; first at Barberton High School in Ohio, then for several semi-pro football teams and on the Ohio Bobcats freshman football team. Goettge gained national fame playing football for the Quantico Marines. Drawing attention from the NFL, Goettge eventually turned down a contract with the New York Giants. Goettge Patrol Prior to the Marine invasion of the Solomon Islands in Operation Watchtower, Goettge, Division D-2 augmented Marine Intelligence when he traveled to Australia spending a week in Melbourne and a few days in Sydney gathering information on the Islands from people who lived and worked there. In addition to information gleaned from interviews Goettge brought eight Australians to where the First Marine Division was forming in Wellington, New Zealand.p.13 Leckie, Robert Strong Men Armed: The United States Marines Against Japan Da Capo Press, 2011 The Marines landed on Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, and within several days rounded up a number of Japanese Navy laborers, who had been assigned to construct the airfield at Lunga Point. Most were malnourished and sick from tropical illnesses. A Japanese warrant officer was among the prisoners and, after being plied with alcohol, told the Marines that there were a number of Japanese west of the Matanikau River. These soldiers were reportedly sick, demoralized, and willing to surrender. At about the same time, Marines near the Matanikau perimeter reported seeing a white flag flying from a tree. It is possible that this was actually a normal Japanese flag with the Hinomaru disc insignia obscured. These reports, as well as several other similar accounts were given to Goettge. He thought that this might be an opportunity to secure much of the island without significant fighting and he decided to act quickly. He organized a 25 man patrol to land just west of the Matanikau estuary. The plan was to follow the Matanikau upstream, bivouac for a night, then head east back to the Lunga perimeter. The patrol consisted of Goettge; Japanese translator Lieutenant Ralph Corry; regimental surgeon, Lieutenant Commander Malcom Pratt; and a handful of scouts and infantry. Just before the patrol departed on the evening of August 12, Goettge was informed by Colonel William J. Whaling, the 5th Marine Regiment's executive officer, that the Japanese were strongly defending the area between Point Cruz and the mouth of the Matanikau. Whaling suggested a landing west of Point Cruz. The Goettge Patrol left at dusk on a tank lighter. However, a flare was seen to the east and the lighter returned to the perimeter, thinking it was a signal to return. The patrol then left for a second time around 9:00 p.m. Despite Whaling's warning, the boat headed for an area just to the west of the Matanikau river mouth. Before the patrol reached the beach, the lighter ran aground on a sandbar. The coxswain gunned the motor to free the vessel, and the Marines disembarked on the beach around 10:00 p.m. Unbeknownst to Goettge, the Japanese had heard the sound of the stuck landing craft, and began organizing troops on a coral plateau about inland from the Marines. Goettge ordered a defensive perimeter established, then took two men, Captain Ringer and First Sergeant Custer, with him to scout the jungle. Not long after they left the beach, the Japanese opened fire and Goettge was killed with a shot to the head. Ringer and Custer managed to make it back to the perimeter. Platoon Sergeant Frank Lowell Few and two Marines went back into the jungle to confirm that Goettge was indeed dead. They found his body and took his watch and insignia, so the Japanese would not be able to identify him as an officer. Over the next nine hours, the patrol lay pinned on the beach. The Japanese maintained fire on the American perimeter, but the Marines were unable to locate the Japanese in the dark jungle. About 30 minutes after landing, Sergeant Arndt was tasked to head out into the ocean and try to swim back to the Lunga perimeter, over to the east. Arndt reached American lines around 5:00 a.m., but it was too late to affect the fate of the Goettge Patrol. During the course of the night, the Japanese picked the Marines off, one by one. The Japanese would occasionally launch a flare to illuminate the beachhead perimeter. However, the Marines were unable to discern the Japanese positions in the moonless night. After some time, Captain Ringer ordered another Marine, Corporal Spaulding, to make a second attempt to get back to American lines. Like Arndt, Spaulding ran off the beach into the ocean, and then started on the grueling swim to safety. He reached American lines around 7:30 a.m. By dawn, only four members of the patrol were still alive. Captain Ringer decided they stood a better chance in the jungle. As the Marines made their dash off the beach, the Japanese opened fire, cutting down the remaining survivors except for Platoon Sergeant Frank Few. Few managed to reach the trees. He saw a Japanese soldier firing into the corpses of the Marines and decided it would be certain death to remain. Few drew his pistol, killed the soldier, then made a dash into the sea. Few looked back and saw Japanese troops swarming the beach, mutilating the bodies of the dead or wounded but still alive Marines. Few also managed to make it back to friendly lines by swimming approximately through shark-infested waters. Few was the last survivor of the Goettge Patrol. A slightly fictionalized version of the incident is in the movie Guadalcanal Diary. In the film, the patrol is led by a \\"Captain Cross\\" and there is only one survivor, though one Marine is shown running along the beach for help. According to a Marine Corps monograph previous to August 21, a patrol found Pratt's dispatch case and a cloth with Goettge's name on it; the monograph also claimed no identifiable remains were found. (See Note # 16 at ) However on August 18, a Marine patrol from 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, made a combat patrol in the same area that the Goettge Patrol was annihilated. They reported seeing remains, but Goettge's body was never found. There are at least five eyewitness reports of finding the remains of the patrol- one from Company \\"I\\"/3/5; one from Company \\"K\\"/3/5;http://kymem.org/warandworksamples.htm and three from Company \\"L\\"/3/5.

It is a major pest of cabbage and related crops in the Brassicaceae, as well as the ornamental flower cleome throughout tropical and North America, especially the warmer parts of the United States. Nymphs are active during the summer and in the tropics the bug can achieve three to six generations a year. In the northern range there is only one generation annually and the insects overwinter as adults in crop residues or field edges. Organic control involves hand-picking the insects off the plants (they can be dropped into soapy water to drown them) and being especially careful to remove and destroy all the eggs, which are black-and-white striped, laid in clutches of twelve. Feeding and chemical defense Harlequin bugs are phytophagous insects. Adults and nymphs feed on the stems and leaves of plants such as cabbage, broccoli, kale, turnip, radish, horseradish, mustard and rapeseed, and often cause blotching by their piercing-sucking feeding. These plants are economically important and are abundant in crop fields but when they are not in production, harlequin bugs are able to feed on wild plants as well. Cruciferous plants such as cabbage produce mustard oil glycosides which give them a stinging flavor. This chemical compound is sequestered by harlequin bugs and stored in the prothorax as they feed. The adult bugs have been shown to be unpalatable to some species of birds thanks to this chemical defense, which could explain their warning coloration. As glucosinolates are often used by crucifers to reduce insect herbivory, their sequestration could also reduce attack rates by insect predators.  Circulation  Like all insects, harlequin bugs have an open circulatory system. Blood is pumped to the head (anteriorly) through the dorsal blood vessel and posteriorly through the ventral body cavity. To map out the circulation of blood in these insects, Craig et al. injected radioactive phosphorus into the posterior end of the heart and traced it through the body cavity. The blood reached the wings first, then the antennae, and then pairs of legs in order from anterior to posterior. Craig et al. also tested the time it takes for blood to form a homogeneous mixture (complete mixing). The time it took for blood to completely mix in harlequin bugs was about twenty-five minutes. Mating Mating pair Harlequin bugs reproduce rapidly and females mate multiple times with many males before laying up to 149 eggs per female. Mating in harlequin bugs is similar to other insects in that the male transfers sperm to the female and the female stores this sperm in a specialized structure called the spermatheca. Using electron microscopy, Stacconi et al. were able to study the structure of the spermatheca in detail (2011). A saccular dilation in the spermatheca stores spermatozoa received from males during copulation. It can maximize efficiency and use of sperm. Derived from the ectoderm, the spermatheca is covered in fat and tissue and has three main regions: the distal region, the medial region and the proximal region. The coiled distal region is responsible for the control of sperm flow. It can modulate how much sperm is excreted which ensures that the female does not lose an excess of sperm. The proximal region contains valves which prevent the backflow of sperm when muscles dilate. This region is connected to the spermathecal duct where sperm exits. Stacconi and Romani (2011) found that, overall, the saccular structure within the spermatheca plays a key role in identifying mated and unmated females. Males are able to identify a mated versus unmated female by the volume of the saccular gland. The study also shows that parasitoid insects are able to identify mated and unmated females. Female mate choice is based heavily on host plants because male size and coloration, which is important in mating, is determined by the type of host plant were reared on. During mating, females also prefer males which have similar odor cues to the host plant of the female. Females of M. histrionica oviposit on specific plants that are able to provide better nutrition and habitat for their offspring. One study done by Hemley-Hartman and Miller (2014) studied the effects of host plants on female oviposition site choice. The researchers used broccoli and mustard as two different host plants and found that individuals reared on broccoli were more likely to mate in general and all individuals reared on mustard mated. Individuals reared on mustard were larger than individuals reared on broccoli. Also, the distinctive orange color of M. histrionica which plays a role in mate choice, was not affected by host plants. This study shows that M. histrionica have variation in mate choice depending on changing seasons because the availability of these commercial plants also changes with season.  Migration  It is important for M. histrionica to migrate from plant to plant depending on seasonal and insect density changes. In a study conducted by Englishloeb and Collier (1987), insects released from the original bush had different migration preferences depending on their sex. Males tended to migrate to short distances from the original plant and females mostly remained on the original plant. The results of this study were appropriate because males are more inclined to find mates and reduce competition by migrating away from a dense area while females need to oviposit. Plants with higher flowering capability were more likely to house females for a long period of time because flowers and buds are able to provide more nourishment for nymphs. Pheromones and aggregation M. histrionica males contain 10,11-epoxy-1-bisabolen-3-ol, a pheromone more commonly known as murgantinol. The stereoisomers of male harlequin bug pheromones consists of two compounds: tridecane and murgantinol. These substances, found specifically in male pheromones, are responsible for aggregation of the insects to aid in sexual reproduction and can also be used in warning predators. A study conducted by Zahn et al. (2008) found that mature male insects produced pheromones that recruited females, other males and young insects based on attractiveness. For females, the pheromone is used as a sex-pheromone to attract mates. Other males use a different version of this pheromone to aggregate more males to a given area to signal the availability of food and it serves a similar purpose with nymphs. Nymphs use the pheromone to guide themselves to the food source in starving conditions. Pheromones can also be used to bait plants that are staples for M. histrionica and trap the insects. M. histrionica are major pests of plants in the family Brassicaceae. In a study conducted by Ludwig and Kok (2001), researchers tested broccoli, mustard and rape plants for attractiveness to the harlequin bug and found that these plants do not significantly delay development in the bugs. This is what leads to these economically important plants to be targeted by M. histrionica. The study showed that all plants, especially small and young plants even at lower densities of insects, experienced death after being targeted by harlequin bugs, although larger plants could bear more numbers.

Early life Darnell was born in Camden, New Jersey. At age 16, while working as a lifeguard in Wildwood, New Jersey, he was playfighting with co-workers when a wrestling promoter spotted him and asked him to help with his roster, as many current ones were seeing action in World War II. Career His first match with later rival Buddy Rogers was in February 1944, tagging with him in Philadelphia and Baltimore-Washington. Darnell would himself leave wrestling for World War II service in December 1944, joining the United States Army. Post-war Darnell returned to wrestling in Texas, once more with Rogers, who had previously wrestled under his real name Herman Rohde. At the time he was becoming \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers, and Darnell was booked as his brother Billy Rogers. This was largely in part to promoter and Rogers' booker Jack Pfefer, though Darnell himself has stated he wasn't sure if the idea for the brother gimmick was Rogers' or Pfefer's. Darnell and Rogers next went to California, with wrestling reaching new popularity thanks to television exposure. For the showmanship of it Rogers donned sequined capes, whereas Darnell first donned the leopard-skin outfit, for which he would become famous. Their careers would become forever intertwined when they began facing each other with Rogers as the heel champion and Darnell becoming a heavy fan favorite. Promoters nationwide wanted the Rogers-Darnell match, with more than 200 matches occurring between them. Despite their history Rogers still crushed discs in Darnell's neck with a botched piledriver, though he himself accidentally knocked out some of Rogers' teeth. Les Thatcher has even stated that Darnell's matches with Rogers inspired him to enter the wrestling business. Darnell was also known for a well recognized team with Bill Melby, winning the Chicago version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship with him in 1953. In 1954, he worked with Sam Muchnick in St. Louis and also booked for an Indiana promotion. In a televised match on 20 May 1961, Darnell beat Ali Pasha (Alexander Vieira Fontes) who died of a heart attack after being slammed down. He used his World War II G.I. Bill to attend aviation school and become a pilot, flying himself to his matches. He also ran a nightclub until 1985. Though Darnell retired in 1961, he would wrestle sparsely into the next year, then went to a chiropractic school in Glendale, California, finishing in Indiana. He would begin practicing in his home of New Jersey and moved to Florida for a period, getting back in touch with Rogers, before returning to New Jersey. Darnell regularly attended Cauliflower Alley Club reunions and received the Senator Hugh Farley Award from the Amsterdam, New York-based Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame.

The dodder resembles a pile of yellow-orange straw wrapped tightly around its host plant. It is mostly stem; the leaves are reduced to scales on the stem's surface, since they are not needed for photosynthesis while the dodder is obtaining nutrients from its host. It bears tiny white flowers which are only about 3 millimeters wide, and fruits which are even smaller. Habitat This is a member of grassland and chaparral plant communities and can be found in weedy, partially disturbed areas.

He argued numerous cases before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses in defense of their religious freedoms, winning most of them. In 1967, he defended then world heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali in his legal battle against the draft during the Vietnam War. Early life Covington was born in East Texas, and reared on a farm near Dallas, Texas. His father was a Texas Ranger. An able student, Covington worked his way through law school in San Antonio, at the San Antonio Public School of Law, in its waning days before becoming St. Mary's University School of Law in 1934.Ernest A. Raba, St. Mary's University School of Law: A Personal Reminiscence (1986) Covington successfully passing the Texas bar exam, with an impressively high score, one year before graduation. He was admitted to the Texas Bar in 1933. Jehovah's Witnesses Covington was first exposed to Jehovah's Witnesses through the broadcast sermons of Watch Tower Society President Joseph F. Rutherford on radio station KTSA in San Antonio. He was attracted to the group's teachings, and defended several of its members in Texas courts before being formally baptized as a member in 1934.Penton, M. James Apocalypse Delayed, 3rd Ed. (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 205) pg 106 After Rutherford learned of Covington's successes defending Jehovah's Witnesses, he asked Covington to represent the Society for a case before the US Supreme Court. He was then invited to join the headquarters staff as general counsel in 1939, succeeding Olin R. Moyle.Penton, M. James Apocalypse Delayed 106 When Rutherford died in January 1942, Covington maintained his aggressive litigation policy. Covington was elected vice-president of the Watch Tower Society, succeeding the newly elected president, Nathan H. Knorr, despite having been a Jehovah's Witness for only five years. Until 2000, appointment to the board of directors of the Watch Tower Society was almost exclusively limited to those professing to be of the \\"anointed class\\" who would \\"rule as Kings\\" in heaven with Christ, Covington being the only exception.\\"How the Governing Body Differs From a Legal Corporation\\", The Watchtower, January 15, 2001, page 28, \\"Annual meetings of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania have been held since January of 1885. When the ingathering of anointed Christians was underway in the late 19th century, the directors and officers of this corporation had the heavenly hope. In fact, this has almost always been the case. There was one exception. In 1940, Hayden C. Covington‚Äîthen the Society's legal counsel and one of the \\"other sheep,\\" with the earthly hope‚Äîwas elected a director of the Society. (John 10:16) He served as the Society's vice president from 1942 to 1945. At that time, Brother Covington stepped aside as a director to comply with what then seemed to be Jehovah's will‚Äîthat all directors and officers of the Pennsylvania corporation be anointed Christians. Lyman A. Swingle replaced Hayden C. Covington on the board of directors, and Frederick W. Franz was elected vice president. Why did Jehovah's servants believe that all the directors and officers of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania should be anointed Christians? Because at the time, the board of directors and officers of the Pennsylvania corporation were closely identified with the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses, which has always been made up entirely of spirit-anointed men. A subsequent policy change resulted in Covington's resignation from the Vice Presidency and departure from the board in 1945; however, he remained on staff as legal counsel.\\"Education for the Theocratic Ministry Advanced\\", The Watchtower, November 1, 1955, page 650, \\"On September 24, 1945, H. C. Covington graciously declined to serve further as a member of the board of directors and as vice-president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, not as an evasion of responsibilities, but rather as an effort to comply with what appeared to be the Lord's will for all the members of the directorate and the officers to be of the anointed ones [with a heavenly hope], since his hope was [earthly as] that of one of the \\"other sheep.\\" ...Covington has continued to head the Society's legal department\\"\\"Declaring the Good News Without Letup (1942-1975)\\", Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, page 91, \\"In September 1945, Brother Covington graciously declined to serve further as vice president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (of Pennsylvania), explaining that he wished to comply with what was then understood to be Jehovah's will for all members of the directorate and officers‚Äîthat they be spirit-anointed Christians, whereas he professed to be one of the 'other sheep.'\\" In 1950, he wrote the Watch Tower tract, Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News to advise Witnesses of their constitutional rights in the United States.Covington, Hayden C. Defending and Legally Establishing the Good News (New York: Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, 1950) p. 2. Covington was subsequently recognized as one of the greatest civil liberties attorneys in American history. During his tenure as the head of the Watch Tower Society's legal department, he presented 111 petitions and appeals to the Supreme Court. He won exactly 37 (more than 80%) of the 44 cases he brought before the Court, involving issues including compulsory flag-salute statutes, public preaching and door-to-door literature distribution. He later resigned as head of the Watch Tower Society's legal department, and was eventually disfellowshipped after clashes with the Society's then-President Nathan Knorr and revelations of a drinking problem. He was reinstated prior to his death in 1978.Penton, M. James, \\"Apocalypse Delayed\\", p. 107. =Cases argued before the Supreme Court= *Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940) *Cox v.

It is held in September on the first Saturday after Labor Day.  About LoToJa  LoToJa was started in 1983 by two Logan cyclists, David Bern, a student at Utah State University, and Jeff Keller, the owner of Sunrise Cyclery. The two men wanted a race that resembled the difficulty of a one-day European classic like Paris- Roubaix or the Tour of Flanders. LoToJa's first year featured seven cyclists racing 192 miles from Logan to a finish line in Jackson's town square. The winning time was just over nine hours by Bob VanSlyke. Since then, LoToJa has grown into one of the nation‚Äôs premier amateur cycling races and continues to be a grueling test of one's physical and mental stamina. Many compete to win their respective category, while others just ride to cross the finish line. At 200+ miles, LoToJa is the longest one-day USAC-sanctioned bicycle race in the country. Cyclists must conquer three mountain passes as they pedal through the scenic terrain of Utah, Idaho and Wyoming en route to a finish line below the rugged Tetons at the base of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. http://www.lotojaclassic.com/ Official LOTOJA Website  Course  The race starts at the Sunrise Cyclery bike shop in Logan, Utah and heads north into southeastern Idaho and winds across western Wyoming. The finish line is near the base of the Grand Teton at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort (at Teton Village), one of America's top ski destinations. Along the scenic or course are three mountain passes, plus hilly to rolling terrain that results in more than of climbing.

Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire and on Machines Fitted to Develop that Power is a book published in 1824 by French physicist Sadi Carnot. (full text of 1897 ed.) ( Full text of 1897 edition on Wikisource 12px) The 118-page book's French title was R√©flexions sur la puissance motrice du feu et sur les machines propres √† d√©velopper cette puissance. It is a significant publication in the history of thermodynamics about a generalized theory of heat engines. Overview The book is considered the founding work of thermodynamics. It contains the preliminary outline of the second law of thermodynamics. Carnot stated that motive power is due to the fall of caloric (heat) from a hot to a cold body. The work was unnoticed until 1834 when French mining engineer √âmile Clapeyron put it on a graphical footing in his Memoir on the Motive Power of Heat. Through Clapeyron's paper, German physicist Rudolf Clausius learned of Carnot's theory of heat and through a modification of Carnot's suppositions on heat, Clausius put the second law in mathematical form with his introduction of the concept of entropy.Clausius, R. (1867). The Mechanical Theory of Heat ‚Äì with its Applications to the Steam Engine and to Physical Properties of Bodies. London: John van Voorst, 1 Paternoster Row. MDCCCLXVII. By 1849, thermo-dynamic, as a functional term, was used in William Thomson's paper An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat.Kelvin, William T. (1849) An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat - with Numerical Results Deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam. Transactions of the Edinburgh Royal Society, XVI. January 2. Scanned Copy The Reflections contain a number of principles such as the Carnot cycle, the Carnot heat engine, Carnot's theorem, thermodynamic efficiency. Similar to how the Reflections was the precursor to the second law, English physicist James Joule's 1843 paper Mechanical equivalent of heat was the precursor to the first law of thermodynamics. Despite the fact that the caloric theory of heat was incorrect, Carnot's work brought together three insights that remain relevant and was used by his successors that led to the concept of entropy: * The \\"fall of heat\\" from a high temperature to a lower temperature is where the work comes from. * Analyzing a cycle, rather than an open system, is the correct way to analyze a heat engine. * The concept of a reversible process.

It was built in honor of the legendary king Po Klaung Garai, who ruled Panduranga from 1151 to 1205, by the historic King Jaya Sinhavarman III,Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.228. Legend of King Klong Garai According to legend, Po Klong Garai (Cham language : Dragon king of J'rai people) started life as a lowly cowherd, but became king of Champa by destiny, ruling wisely and for the good of the people. When the Khmer of Cambodia invaded his kingdom, he challenged them to settle the matter peacefully in a tower- building contest. Po Klaung Garai prevailed in the contest, thereby obliging the invaders to return home.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.232. After his death, Po Klaung Garai became a god and protector of the people on earth; it is said that the tower he built in his contest with the Khmer is the tower that today is known by his name.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.233. History of the Temple The Cham King Jaya Simhavarman III (Viet: Ch√™ M√¢n) is credited with constructing the tower in honor of Po Klaung Garai toward the end of the 13th century. However, the presence of several steles from an earlier period suggests that Jaya Simhavarman may merely have restored and added to structures that were already in place.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.235. An inscription, dated 1050, at Po Klong Garai commemorated the military victory of two Cham princes (presumably representing the northern dynasty of Indrapura headquartered near M·ªπ S∆°n) over the people of Panduranga in southern Champa. According to the inscription, the victorious princes celebrated by erecting two lingas and a victory column.Jean Boisselier, La Statuaire du Champa, p.245-246. Site of the Temple The temple of Po Klaung Garai belongs to what is known as the Thap Mam Style of Cham art and architecture. It consists of three brick towers: a main tower with three stories, a smaller gate tower, and an elongated tower with a saddle-like roof. The group of buildings is well preserved, and \\"is distinguished by the purity of its outlines and the austerity of its decor.\\"Emmanuel Guillon, Hindu Buddhist Art of Vietnam, p.60. Over the front door of the main tower is a sculpture of the god Siva that is regarded as one of the masterpieces of the Thap Mam Style.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, 235-236. The remaining images are less impressive, revealing \\"an art in terminal decline, due to its stiffness and arid workmanship.\\"Emmanuel Guillon, Hindu Buddhist Art of Vietnam, p.61. The tower with the saddle-like roof is said to be dedicated to the God of Flame, Thang Chuh Yang Pui.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.239, 242. The primary religious image in the temple is a mukhalinga of the 16th or 17th century. A mukhalinga is a linga with a human face. In general, the linga is the emblem of the Hindu god Siva, but the Cham say that this one is a statue of King Po Klaung Garai. The temple is still the site of Cham religious festivals.Ng√¥ V«én Doanh, Champa: Ancient Towers, p.241.

The act sought funding to improve availability of and access to care for low-income, uninsured, and under-insured people affected by HIV/AIDS and their families. The act is named in honor of Ryan White, an Indiana teenager who contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion. He was diagnosed with AIDS in 1984 and was subsequently expelled from school because of the disease. White became a well-known advocate for AIDS research and awareness, until his death on April 8, 1990. Ryan White programs are \\"payer of last resort\\" which fund treatment when no other resources are available. As AIDS has spread, the funding of the program has increased. In 1991, the first year funds were appropriated, around US$220 million were spent; by the early 2000s, this number had almost increased 10-fold. The Act was reauthorized in 1996, 2000, 2006, and 2009. The program provides some level of care for around 500,000 people a year and, in 2004, provided funds to 2,567 organizations. The Ryan White programs also fund local and state primary medical care providers, support services, healthcare provider training programs, and provide technical assistance to such organizations. In fiscal year 2005, federal funding for the Ryan White CARE Act was $2.1 billion. As of 2005, roughly one-third of this money went to the AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP) which provides drugs for 30 percent of people living with HIV. The primary activity of ADAP is providing FDA-approved prescription medication. The Ryan White CARE Act mandates that EMS personnel can find out whether they were exposed to life- threatening diseases while providing care. (This notification provision was included in the original 1990 act, dropped in the 2006 reauthorization, and reinstated in the 2008 reauthorization). 2006 reauthorization President Bush signs the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006, in the Oval Office, December 19, 2006. The Ryan White Care Act was due to be reauthorized at the end of 2005, but Congress could not reach agreement on changes, and the act was extended for one year under the old terms. In 2006, the act was reauthorized for three more years, ending on September 30, 2009 with a funding level of $2.1 billion. Prior to the reauthorization, the act allocated money based on the proportion of patients with AIDS in each region. The 2006 reauthorization changed this allocation mechanism to also consider the number of people living with HIV who do not have a clinical diagnosis of AIDS A significant portion of funding from the act is emergency relief for Eligible Metropolitan Areas. The 2006 reauthorization redefined EMAs as cities with a population greater than 50,000, instead of previous versions which required 500,000. 2009 reauthorization President Obama signs the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009. In 2009, Congress passed the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act, which was signed by President Obama on October 30, 2009. This bill extends the Ryan White Care Act for an additional four years. 2013 expiration In 2013, the Ryan White CARE Act expired; however the Program remains as Congress continues to appropriate funding. Special Projects of National Significance The Special Projects of National Significance (often abbreviated to SPNS) program is a United States Department of Health program that helps to \\"advance knowledge and skills in the health and support services to underserved populations diagnosed with HIV infection.\\" The current SPNS effort began in 1991 with several federal grants; portfolio of 72 grants currently address issues in HIV care.

Pathmanathan was on Interpol's most wanted list for various charges including arms smuggling and criminal conspiracy.http://www.interpol.int/notice/search/wanted/1998-4743 He is also wanted by India's law enforcement agencies in connection with the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 and for violation of the Terrorist Act and the Indian Explosive Act. He was arrested on 5 August 2009. Pathmanathan was released from prison on 17 October 2012, when the complaints against him by Sri Lanka were withdrawn. Early life Little information is available on Pathmanthan's early life. He was born Shanmugam Kumaran Tharmalingam on 6 April 1955 in the town of Kankesanthurai in the Jaffna District of Ceylon. Pathmanathan, who can converse in Tamil, English, French and Sinhala is known to have left Sri Lanka in 1983. Aliases Pathmanathan is known to use more than 23 aliases and masks. In addition, his last name can be spelled as Padmanadan or Pathmanaban or Pathmanadan or Pathmanathan, hence there are numerous variations of his name. Involvement in LTTE =Fund raising activities= Pathmanathan was one of the top LTTE officials and the chief procurer of arms for the organization. He ran a global network of LTTE offices which were engaged in its weapons procurement, logistics and money laundering operations. Initially based in Malaysia, where he set up a shipping company in 1987, he was forced to move out after the Malaysian Special Branch cracked down on LTTE activities in the country in 1990, culminating in the seizure of an LTTE ship the same year. Pathmanathan then moved to Thailand, which became a safe haven for the LTTE. There he established himself as the head of banking, procurement and shipping for the LTTE. He is believed to have obtained citizenship of Thailand. According to a report by Jane's Intelligence Review: In Thailand Pathmanathann set up and led the \\"KP Department\\", the procurement arm of the LTTE, the oldest international wing of the organisation. He was responsible for equipping the rebels with a modern day arsenal which enabled them to challenge the Sri Lankan Military and to fight a high intensity war. He procured modern hardware, paid for them through secret bank accounts, and shipped them to the rebels using a merchant shipping network operated by the \\"KP Department\\", known as the \\"sea pigeons\\". Apart from setting up a number of lucrative businesses in Thailand, Pathmanathan established a state-of-the-art boatyard in the country, which manufactured over a dozen different boats, including mini-submarines and suicide boats. The \\"KP Department\\" was complemented by another international wing of the LTTE called the \\"Aiyanna Group\\". While the \\"KP Department\\" acted as the procurement arm of the LTTE, the Aiyanna Group looked after the fund raising and intelligence operations of the organization. Jane's Intelligence Review estimated in 2007 that the LTTE earns between $200‚Äì300 million per year through their fund-raising activities and numerous illegal businesses. The heads of both departments operated under the direct guidance of the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and intelligence head Pottu Amman, both of whom were also on the Interpol most wanted list. =Rajiv Gandhi assassination= On 21 May 1991, former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber at a public meeting in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu. The assassination was carried out by the LTTE suicide bomber Thenmuli Rajaratnam, also known as Dhanu, who detonated an RDX explosive-laden belt tucked below her dress as she bent down to greet him. Intelligence agencies believe that Pathmanathan had links with the planning of the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. The Indian Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) approached 23 countries in 2001 requesting information regarding LTTE members who they believed were linked with the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. Sweden, where Pathmanathan was believed to be hiding at the time, was one of the countries. The Interpol Headquarters in Lyon, France also issued a red notice against Pathmanathan, which requests member states to arrest the suspect and hold him for extradition. The notice stated, \\"Tharmalingam (Pathmanathan) is alleged to have been involved in the murder of Rajiv Gandhi on 21 May 1991 in Tamil Nadu, India.\\" =Intended presence at peace negotiations= Following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE in 2002, the LTTE nominated Pathmanathan as a member of its delegation to the Peace Talks scheduled with the government in late 2003. They passed on a request, through Norwegian facilitators of the negotiations, to find out whether the Government had any objections to \\"Shanmugam Kumaran Tharmalingam\\" being part of the delegation. The Government rejected the request, mainly because he was wanted in India for links with Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, and letting him join the delegation would have ruptured relations between the two nations. The LTTE's reasons for nominating Pathmanathan to the delegations are unclear but most likely had were linked to him being sought by Interpol, CIA and MI5. Being on the list of peace negotiators would have meant, with Sri Lanka's approval, Pathmanathan would no longer be one of the world's most wanted men. =Department of International Relations= In January 2009 Pathmanathan was appointed head of the newly created \\"Department of International Relations\\". He was LTTE's chief international spokesman during the last months of the civil war. =Leader of the LTTE= Pathmanathan was left as the most senior LTTE member following the death of most of the LTTE's leadership, including Prabhakaran, in the final stages of the civil war. On 21 July 2009 a statement was issued, allegedly from the Executive Committee of the LTTE, stating that Pathmanathan had been appointed leader of the LTTE. Fugitive status Pathmanathan was the subject of a worldwide manhunt, which involved police from cities including Johannesburg, Yangon, Singapore and Bangkok. Some of the world's foremost intelligence agencies, including the American CIA and British MI5, were on his trail. He was believed to have had bank accounts in London, Frankfurt, Denmark, Athens and Australia and over 200 passports for his use. In May 2011, he alleged that the United Nations and a \\"western country\\" worked to help many LTTE operatives escape from Sri Lanka.UN tried 'to help Tamil Tigers flee': report AFP - 24 May 2011 Known as an elusive, secretive individual, he helped keep a low profile by having direct contact only with LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. Arrest There were conflicting reports from Thailand that Pathmanathan had been arrested on 11 September 2007. The reports were preceded by the detention in Ranong Province of three other LTTE operatives the month before, for trying to buy guns and 45,000 rounds of ammunition. However a number of Thai officials rejected the reports, claiming they had no information about such an arrest. Thai immigration officers claimed that no such person had entered the country in the last two years. Pathmanathan was arrested in a South East Asian country on 5 August 2009. Initial reports suggested that he was captured in Thailand, but this was denied by Thai authorities. But it was later revealed that he had been arrested by Sri Lankan State Intelligence Service agents and a covert Sri Lankan military intelligence unit, with the cooperation of local authorities, in the Tune Hotel, downtown Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Sri Lankan Government announced on 7 August that he had been brought to Colombo. Sources have termed him \\"crucial\\" to the uncovering of various Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam crime networks.No alliance with detained LTTE leader: Sri Lanka Govt Hindustan Times - 5 July 2010 After the arrest he began cooperating with the Sri Lanka government. On 9 July 2010, Pathmanathan established the North-East Rehabilitation and Development Organization (NERDO), a Non-Governmental Organization for the provision of relief to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) while upgrading facilities for better physical, mental and living conditions for them. In October 2012, media sources reported that Pathmanathan was being released from custody, quoting the head of Media Center for National Security Lakshman Hulugalle.http://in.news.yahoo.com/lankan-military- authorities-free-ex-top-ltte- commander-142509954.htmlhttp://news.in.msn.com/international/sri-lanka-ex-top- ltte-commander-freed Later he rejected the reports by saying Pathmanathan who is under special protection was permitted to engage in his NGO work and has not been released as claimed by media.KP has not been released - Hulugalle References External links *LTTE Department of International Relations *Interpol wanted notice 1955 births Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam members Living people Sri Lankan Tamil rebels ","title":"Selvarasa Pathmanathan"},{"id":"13210272","text":"The Royal Maintenance Corps \\"silah al siyana al-malaki\\" (ÿ≥ŸÑÿßÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿµŸäÿßŸÜÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑŸÉŸä) is a branch of the Jordanian Armed Forces.

Its latest variant is still in service along with several different modern helmets, but is being phased out in favor of more modern kevlar helmets. History and variants During World War I Bulgarian soldiers were equipped with the German Stahlhelm M1916, which remained in service up to the end of the 1930s. The restrictions imposed on the Bulgarian Army by the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine of 1919 were overcome in the mid-1930s and in 1935 the High Command ordered the design of a new army helmet. At the end of 1935 the prototype was ready and subsequently approved in 1936.–•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ –ü. –î–µ—Ä–º–µ–Ω–¥–∂–∏–µ–≤, \\"–ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∏ –∫–∞—Å–∫–∏ \\", \\"–í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ- –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ —Å–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫\\", –±—Ä–æ–π 2, 2004, retrieved on September 11, 2007. The general design was distantly reminiscent of the Stahlhelm, but with some considerable alterations. The general structure and depth were similar, but the brim was shortened, opened wider and more gradually turned. The ventilation apertures were retained, but set in smaller rounded fittings. The angles of the side and upper surfaces were conically increased with the aim of causing hits of over 90¬∞ angle to ricochet. From mid-front to mid-rear a well- pronounced projecting rib was shaped. As a result, the helmet received a very distinctive outline with only a distant likeness to the Stahlhelm.helmets.ru, –ë–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è –ú36, retrieved on September 11, 2007. It was made of steel with only a small quantity of the first model made of lighter laminated iron, exclusively as officers' dress gear. The edges of the shell were rolled over in the earliest type known as A, while on the later type known as B these were straight cut. In 1939 a new redesigned version with shallowed shell and shortened brim, known as type C, was brought into service. An estimated 70% of all production was of this third model. Factory-issued helmets were initially dark greyish-green in colour with a small shield in Bulgarian flag colours on the right. Later new brighter pea-green shade was introduced.kaski.boinaslava.net , retrieved on September 11, 2007. The leather suspension, or liner, were produced in several different variants. The M36 helmet design became lighter, more compact, and more comfortable than the First World War-era designs and provided excellent protection. It was introduced in regular service in 1936. Initially, production began outside Bulgaria in three foreign factories: Sandrik in Doln√© H√°mre and Br√ºder Gottlieb und Brauchbar in Brno (Brat≈ôi G&B; ‚Äì Brno) in Czechoslovakia and Eisenhuttenwerk Thale in Thale, Germany. In the end of 1935 a punching press was imported from Germany to Bulgaria and installed at the military works in the town of Kazanlak, and subsequently production continued in Bulgaria as well. The earlier bigger and heavier types A and B were phased out in the early 1950s, but the latest type C is still in service in the Bulgarian army, but is being phased out completely in the 2010s, in favor of a newer kevlar helmet, the BK-3 developed by the Croatian-based company ≈†estan-Busch.

Debuted in April 1985, the RX-Z it was very popular in Malaysia and Singapore and has been sold for more than two decades before the production was ended in 2011. In 2004, the model was revised cosmetically and a catalytic converter was installed.  Overview  The Yamaha RX-Z was originally equipped with a five-speed transmission with solid front disc brake. The model shared the same platform and chassis as its predecessor, the water-cooled Yamaha RD125. Shortly after the launch, the RX-Z became popular among young motorcyclists especially in Malaysia. A few years later, the engine was upgraded with the installation of a six-speed transmission, together with newer instrument panel and handlebar switches, as well as a cross-drilled front disc brake rotor. Since then, the design of the RX-Z remained unchanged until 2004 when the model was updated, with the rear lights borrowed from the Yamaha Y125Z. The new RX-Z was equipped with a catalytic converter, sacrificing 1 PS of maximum power (original maximum power: 21 PS). However, the maximum torque remained unchanged but the low-end torque was improved compared with the early models. Some owners of the earlier RX-Z motorcycles may have problems during take-off because the engine tends to stall when an inexperienced rider tries to take off in the first gear. However, the problem was resolved in the new model. In Malaysia, the RX-Z was one of the motorcycle models often associated with Mat Rempit street racers. As a result, many Malay movies including Remp-It use the RX-Z in their movies. The production of the RX-Z ended in 2011 after being sold for more than two decades.

She also served as the former artistic administrator of the Royal Opera House in London. Biography She was born in London in 1916. She enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music and studied piano. However, she initially decided to pursue a career as an insurance agent. She became acquainted with the classical music industry by attending a large number of concerts. Through her concert contacts, she was offered a job with the Entertainments National Service Association, a United Kingdom World War II era agency that provided entertainment to British military servicemen. Following the end of World War II, Ingpen established her own classical music talent management agency, Ingpen & Williams in 1946. The Ingpen & Williams agency was named for herself and her pet dachshund, Williams, whom she considered to be co-founders of the agency Her early clients during the 1950s included conductors Sir Georg Solti, Geraint Evans and Rudolf Kempe, as well as Joan Sutherland. She was keen to cast British singers, including David Ward, William McCue and William McAlpine. Ingpen sold Ingpen & Williams in 1961 in order to become the artistic administrator of the Royal Opera House that same year. However, she remained actively involved in her former agency. In 1963, Ingpen heard in Dublin a young Italian tenor, Luciano Pavarotti, whose potential she recognised immediately. She booked him as substitute/stand-in singer for Giuseppe di Stefano in a revival of La Boh√®me, offering him the role of Rodolfo for the final performance. Pavarotti took Covent Garden by storm and his performance earned him critical praise and helped to launch his career as an internationally renowned tenor. Retirement Ingpen retired from the industry in 1984 and returned to her home near Brighton, England. However, she continued to work, this time with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City as a vocal consultant, until her retirement from that institution in 1987. Death Joan Ingpen died at her hometown of Hove, England, on 29 December 2007, after a short illness. She was 91 years old. She had been married twice and had no children. In Brighton, she lived with her partner, actor Sebastian Shaw, who predeceased her.

The episode was written by Bill Wrubel and directed by Rodman Flender. This episode would mark Alan Dale's last episode in this series as a full-time regular, as Ugly Betty would be his third television series in which Dale's characters were all written out of each series respectively through fatal heart attacks, following Neighbours and The O.C.. Plot The story begins with the news of Bradford ending up in the hospital after he suffered a heart attack during the wedding, as reported by Suzuki St. Pierre. Betty shows up at the hospital, where the resuscitated Bradford is in the Intensive Care Unit, and she's snubbed by Daniel. When Christina see this, Betty tells her that Daniel has indeed fired her. And while Betty goes unnoticed by Daniel, he does see and kicks Wilhelmina out of Bradford's room, saying that since the wedding didn't take place she is not a member of the family. As Daniel and Alexis argue, Bradford wakes up and tells them to stop fighting, and they do. As Alexis leaves the room, Daniel tells Bradford that after what has happened, he still loves him and after Daniel leaves, Bradford said that he loved Daniel too. While the two sit around over what has happened, Daniel gets some encouragement from Amanda, who says that Daniel does have his father's jaw line. Betty goes back to the MODE office to clean out her desk and she meets L'Amanda, the weekend security guard, who is aware of Betty's relationship with Henry, since L'Amanda has the hots for \\"Sugar Stick\\" (aka Henry). As she walks in to pick up her pink bunny Betty hears a voice that wants to take it from her. She then looks up and sees that she's talking to the version of herself (wearing the \\"Guadajara\\" poncho) from the first day that she started her job, as it appears that Past Betty is disappointed by some of the things that this Current Betty has been doing with her life, not to mention being disappointed that current Betty have not moved up in the publishing world (and learning that Amanda is still mean). Betty later comes back to reality as she sees Christina walk in. When Betty gets home she finds Claire and Yoga hiding in her bedroom, waiting for her. Claire tells Betty that she plans to leave the country for Italy that very night, but before she goes she has to know that in the event that Bradford dies he has not changed his will to leave the company to Wilhelmina. She gives Betty the location of the will and the combination of the safe in which it's contained, and Betty decides to go along with Claire's plan so she can try to make amends for having kept Wilhelmina's affair with Dwayne to herself. After Betty leaves, Ignacio hears noises coming from Betty's room and he discovers Claire and Yoga, Yoga pretending to be cable TV repairmen, a gimmick that Claire finds lame. Soon after they are also discovered by Hilda, who gives Claire a makeover to help her to look more like the Latina on the passport (under the faux name \\"Maria Elena Sonzoni\\") that she intends to use. After she sees Justin coming from the living room Claire decides that she can't leave without seeing her family one last time, so Ignacio agrees to help get Claire into the hospital and get to Daniel. Claire also tells Yoga that if she doesn't return, Yoga is to leave without her. While riding back to the Meade Building, Wilhelmina ponders her next move as she tells Marc she has to find a way to become a Meade and was hoping to walk into the Building as the new owner. And like Betty, Wilhelmina decides that she'd like to find Bradford's will, too, before Bradford gives everything away to charity (which Marc thought was a person's name). Later that day at the Building, Amanda won't let Betty (who claimed she left stuff behind) back into the building because she's no longer an employee, so Betty turns to Henry for help. Betty and Henry make their way to Bradford's office and are soon joined by Wilhelmina and Marc. After the foursome square off Betty opens the safe (the combination written on her hand), but there is no will there, so she and Marc get the idea that the coveted document might be somewhere in Fey's secret love dungeon, thus giving the foursome the same idea, prompting Marc to tell Betty that she has something on her glasses, and then tosses them to the floor. He gives Henry a push, and grabs Wilhelmina. They run off and lock Henry and Betty in the office. As Henry decides that he and Betty should crawl through the building's heating ducts to get to the secret room, Wilhelmina is offended that she never knew about this place and that she was never invited there. In the dungeon, Marc finds the will that states that Wilhelmina would only get a share, but only after she marries Bradford. Meanwhile, in another part of the building, Henry falls through a grate and practically lands in L'Amanda's lustful arms. He distracts her long enough for Betty to make her escape, then he breaks free from L'Amanda's embrace. Like Wilhelmina and Marc, they also find the will and calls Claire to tell her that Daniel and Alexis will still inherit the company. As they prepare to leave, Betty decides to write a nasty letter and leave it on Marc's desk, but as she tapes it to the computer Betty and Henry accidentally discover that Marc has been ordained over the internet to perform weddings. They realize what Wilhelmina is up to, so they rush to the hospital to stop her plan. While Bradford's room is empty, Wilhelmina and Marc slip in so that Marc can perform a legal wedding ceremony, but Bradford would come to his senses and stops the ceremony by telling Wilhelmina that Daniel had told him about how she'd cheated on him with her bodyguard Dwayne. When he asked her to look him in the eye to see if she loved him, Wilhelmina didn't, prompting Bradford to ask her to leave. When Ignacio arrives at the hospital, he informs Daniel and Alexis that their mother is here, so they head to the elevator, where besides telling her children how much she loves them, Claire also tells Daniel the reason why Betty hadn't told him sooner about Wilhelmina's fling with Dwayne, which was to get Ignacio back into the United States. As Betty arrived to Bradford's room, she is relieved that Bradford didn't marry Wilhelmina now that he knows the truth. Betty then calls Claire's cell phone so that the Meades can be reunited. As Claire answers the phone, she tells her children that will give up her plan to flee to Italy, so she walks out of the elevator and reveal her identity to the reporters and photographers in the hallway as she enters Bradford's room. The two talk and finally reconcile for what would be their last time together. Daniel tells Betty that after what has happened and that he now knows why she had to betray him, he'd like her to come back to work for him, but as she once again sees her past Betty looking at her, she does not think that she should return to MODE because Betty believes that she is not the Betty that she used to be. The Past Betty is relieved as she walks away (and as usual, still bumps into glass doors). Claire leaves and is caught by police and is dragged away. Betty again visits Bradford after Daniel asks Betty to stay with him. Bradford tells Betty that he wants her to promise that she will take care of Daniel because he knew from the first day he saw her walk into the building that she would be the one that guide Daniel's path. As Betty gets Bradford his water, he dies as Betty watches the doctors attempt to unsuccessfully save him. After his death and Claire's arrest makes the evening news, the Suarezes turn around to see Yoga sneak off towards the airport when they hear the reporter mentioned Claire stating that Yoga (whose real name is Amelia Bluman) was \\"killed\\" in their escape attempt. Hours later, Wilhelmina later appears in the morgue and makes a proposition to the young doctor who is attending to Bradford's body. As we find out in \\"Bananas for Betty\\", Whilhelmina took some of Bradford's sperm and plans to give birth to a baby, so that she can get her stake in the company. Production \\"I See Me, I.C.U.\\" was originally titled \\"You May Find Yourself\\", but as with most episodes in the series, it was changed at the last minute.From The Futon Critic Prior to the episode's airing, there was speculation that one of the series' regulars would die in the second season by year's end.The stench of death is going to envelop someone on - Ask Ausiello  TVGuide.com This would be the first episode in which viewers would hear Yoga's real name, Amelia Bluman. It also marked Lorraine Toussaint's final appearance in that recurring role. Ironically, viewers were hoping that Yoga would stick around as a regular character because of the chemistry between Claire and Yoga, but the producers have decided to write her character out of the series, with no plans to bring her back.From TV Guide Music notes The song played at the end of the episode is \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" by U2.

A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as Nashville's Director of Law under Mayor Bill Purcell from 1999 to 2007. In 1990, 1994 and 1998, he was elected the city's public defender. Dean, an attorney by occupation, is currently an Adjunct Professor of Law at Vanderbilt University Law School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University in 1978 and a Juris Doctor from Vanderbilt University in 1981. His campaign message for Mayor of Nashville focused on improving education, public safety and economic development saying \\"it's all connected.\\" During Dean's first year in office, he reworked the arrangement between Metro and the Nashville Predators in order to keep the team in Nashville. During Dean's first term, he faced two major challenges: the Great Recession and the 2010 Tennessee floods. During his two terms in office, Dean transformed Downtown Nashville by adding a new minor league baseball stadium, a riverfront amphitheater and park and a new convention center dubbed Music City Center. Dean was friendly towards business and often used tax incentives to lure companies to Nashville. He is also involved in conservationist efforts of historical areas such as Music Row through his involvement with Music Industry Coalition. He helped preserve historic sites such as RCA Studio A. In 2017, Dean declared his candidacy for Governor of Tennessee in the 2018 election. In the first three months of the campaign, Dean raised $1.2 million and spent $200,000; he went on to win the Democratic nomination on August 2, 2018 and advanced to the general election. Dean lost the election to businessman Bill Lee. Legal opinions as Metro Law Director In March 2005, Karl Dean wrote that Mayor Bill Purcell could seek a third term, despite a 1994 referendum on \\"any elected office authorized or created by the [Metro] charter.\\" This was because the 1963 charter states that there is a three-term limit for mayors, the 1994 amendment took place against a backdrop of a push for congressional term limits, and local public discussion focused on the Metro Council. In January 2003, he said a proposed law to ban job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was not unconstitutional. When Metro Council members' health-care benefits came under scrutiny in September 2004, because the Metro Charter does not allow pension benefits for Council members, Dean said that a health-care benefit wouldn't legally fall under a pension benefit, and therefore wouldn't be against the Charter. When asked if an amendment to the Metropolitan Charter requiring raises in the maximum property tax rates approved by the Metro Council to also be approved by Metro voters, Dean said that a court was likely to find that provision of the Metro Charter invalid. This is because, he said, the Tennessee General Assembly has not authorized the charter of a consolidated government to restrict the authority of a legislative body to levy an ad valorem tax on property. Mayor of Nashville = Elections = Dean at a 2007 Nashville mayoral debate Dean announced his mayoral candidacy on December 19, 2006. His campaign message focused on improving education, public safety, and economic development saying \\"it's all connected.\\" In the general election on August 2, 2007, he placed first with 24.6% of the vote. This advanced him to a run-off election against Bob Clement. On September 11, 2007 Dean won the run-off election with 52.2% of the vote. Dean easily won re-election in August 2011 with 79.2% of the vote. Dean left office on September 25, 2015. He was succeeded by Megan Barry, the first woman to be Mayor of Nashville. = Education policy = During Dean's two terms, the budget for Metro Nashville schools increased by $218 million (37 percent) and Nashville schools saw increased graduation rates, reduced dropout rates, and improved test scores. He created the Limitless Libraries program, which connects Nashville Public Libraries to Metro Nashville Schools, part of a greater push to enable opportunities for underserved schools in the city. Dean also improved school choice by recruiting charter schools to the city and augmented teaching talent by partnering with Teach for America. As a part of this partnership, summer academies were created. = Economic development = Dean's tenure as Mayor marked sales taxes revenue increased by over $100 million (36 percent), indicative of the growth of Nashville as a major city. One of the marquee projects of Dean's mayoral career was overseeing the creation of Music City Center, a massive convention center that has generated over $735 million in revenue for the city. Other projects included the construction of Ascend Amphitheater and First Tennessee Park, public venues that bring in millions of dollars of revenue to the city and have been instrumental in the expansion of downtown Nashville. Finally, Dean incentivized businesses to relocate to Nashville, including Bridgestone Americas and HCA.  Great Recession  Dean led Nashville during the Great Recession. At that time, the city experiencing 7 years of GDP growth and an increase of $35 billion (45 percent) in that time. Nashville has had one of the most successful recoveries from the recession. By the end of Dean's mayoral term, Nashville had added the third highest percentage employment since its lowest point in the recession out of all cities in the US, adding over 144,300 jobs (19.3 percent employment growth). = Crime and safety = With public safety as one of Dean's primary campaign promises, Dean increased the size of the Nashville police force by 13.5 percent. In conjunction with this, Dean opened two new precincts to more equally distribute areas of coverage and started Nashville's first DNA crime lab. By 2013, Nashville had reached the lowest crime numbers and homicide rate in its history. = Environment = Dean's time as Mayor was accompanied by increased construction of greenway and bike paths around the city of Nashville. He added over 4,000 acres of park land and created the city's Office of Environment and Sustainability. As a result of his efforts, curbside recycling was expanded around the Metro area and the city moved in a more green direction. Gubernatorial campaign On February 26, 2017, Dean announced he would run for Governor of Tennessee in the 2018 election as a Democrat. He cast himself as a pro-business moderate running on a message of education, jobs, and healthcare in Tennessee. In the first three months of the campaign, Dean raised $1.2 million and spent $200,000, making him the third most funded candidate for governor behind Republicans Randy Boyd & Bill Lee. Dean easily won the primary election over long-time state representative Craig Fitzhugh, earning over 75% of the primary vote. In the general election, Dean was defeated handily by Bill Lee, a native Tennessean who inherited his father's plumbing and contracting business and won victory as a first-time candidate who has never held elective office. Lee defeated Dean in the November 6 general election, receiving 1,336,106 votes (59.5%) to Dean's 864,863 votes (38.5%). Personal life Dean has been married to Anne Davis, a prominent Tennessee lawyer, since August 6, 1983. Anne Davis is a relative of Joe C. Davis Jr. and Rascoe Davis and is a proprietor of the Joe C. Davis Foundation in Nashville. Both Anne and Karl are Catholic. Dean and his wife have three children, Rascoe, Frances, and Wallen.

As do all branch temples, way-places, and organizations of Fo Guang Shan, the branch follows Humanistic Buddhism, a modernized style of Buddhist teaching as propagated by Venerable Master Hsing Yun, spiritual founder and teacher of the order. History  In 1989, while monks from the Fo Guang Shan order were preaching Buddhist teachings on the southern islands of Cebu and Bacolod, they received requests from lay followers in Manila. In November 1992, Venerable Yung Guang brought with her statues of the Three Treasure Buddhas (namely Sakyamuni, Amitabha, and Bhaisajyaguru) to the famous Ongpin Street, in Manila's Chinatown. In the beginning, Venerable Yung Guang founded the small Manila Buddhist Center in a premises offered by lay devotees. After half a year of preaching, the number of lay followers increased, and the space was no longer sufficient to accommodate all of them. Having realized the great potential in the capital of the Philippines, Venerable Yung Guang invited Venerable Tzu Chuang, director of the Overseas Supervisory Council and senior bhikkuni of the Fo Guang Shan order, to come to Manila to inspect a historical building, which was the former USSR Embassy, and renamed it the \\"Manila Lecture Hall\\". This constituted a new page in the history of Buddhist preaching in the Philippines. Following the guiding principles set out by Fo Guang Shan, the Manila Lecture Hall propagated Dharma through education, cultural activities, charitable programs, and Buddhist practices. Activities such as Youth Summer Camps, Children's Summer Camps, Filipino children's classes, and lectures on Buddhism were conducted regularly. With the assistance of the local Buddhist community, a seven-day exhibit on hundreds of Buddhist statues from private collections was held at the Century Park Hotel. This was an unprecedented undertaking in the history of Buddhism in the Philippines which attracted a huge number of Buddhists and non-Buddhists who came to appreciate Buddhist art. One of the Manila Lecture Hall's charitable programs was to help Filipinos in times of natural calamities while respecting local religions and customs. Thus, the Manila Lecture Hall steadily integrated itself into the society and culture of the Philippines. It has also regularly been invited to take part in many inter- religious dialogues and other activities. Hundreds of university students who wished to learn more about Buddhism visit the temple every year to participate in various lectures. Over the years, the cultural, educational and charitable programs organized by the temple have attracted an increasing number of participants and received recognition from both the lay and religious community. Consequently, it has changed its name to I.B.P.S. Manila and became the main branch of the Fo Guang Shan Temple in the Philippines. The temple was also relocated once again to a property beside the former location in preparation for the construction of the new I.B.P.S. building. Under the direction of its head abbess, Venerable Yung Jau, who has been in the Philippines for twelve years, and together with the venerables and lay devotees of the Chu Un Temple in Cebu City, the Yuan Thong Temple in Bacolod City, and the Iliolo Fo Guang Vihara, IBPS Manila vowed to \\"sow the seeds of culture and education that help purify people‚Äôs minds in this beautiful archipelago\\".

Although it belongs to a subdivision called the inarticulata which have shells where the mineral content consist of calcium phosphate, the Craniidae have shells that consist of calcium carbonate. Other special characteristics of this family are that no outgrowths are developed to form a hinge between both valves, nor is there any support for the lophophore. As adults, craniids either lived free on the ocean floor or, more commonly, were attached to a hard object with all or part of the ventral valve. All other brachiopods are supposed to have a stalk or pedicle, at least as an adolescent, but in craniids a pedicle is not known from any development stage. They are the only members of the order Craniida and the monotypic suborder Craniidina and superfamily Cranioidea; consequently, the latter two taxa are presently redundant and not used very often. Valdiviathyris and Neoancistrocrania were sometimes separated in a family Valdiviathyrididae but this has turned out to be unjustified.Robinson & Lee (2007) Most Craniidae are long extinct forms known only from fossils like all other Craniforma. However, some 20 species of this 470-million-year-old lineage are surviving today. They include Valdiviathyris quenstedti which has remained essentially unchanged for the last 35 million years or so. Although some minimal evolution would obviously have taken place in the meantime, this was essentially silent mutations and marginal adaptations to cooler habitat. Present-day Valdiviathyris are all but inseparable from those of the Late Eocene and the genus cannot even be divided into chronospecies. Thus, V. quenstedti is a true living fossil and one of the oldest and most long-lived species known to science.

He won the commission for the design of the national pantheon in 1903 and graduated the following year. After further studies abroad he returned home and began working on the combination of reinforced concrete technology with folkloric design elements. He also travelled to northern Africa and India to study the architecture there. In 1906, he took the mother's grandfather's surname for Medgyaszay. Medgyaszay had a successful academic career and was highly regarded until the communist takeover in the late 1940s when he was criticised for his apolitical or so-called formalist approach to art.

For most places this meant that two elections, the municipal elections and the county elections ran concurrently. In addition, several municipalities held direct mayoral elections. For the country at large, the election produced a major setback for the Socialist Left Party, while most other parties, including the two other parties of the governing Red-Green Coalition, the Norwegian Labour Party and the Centre Party, made some advances or held their position from 2003. Term of office was 1 January 2008 until 31 December 2011. Identification requirement A new rule required voters to produce an identity document in order to vote. This change was criticized by the Red Electoral Alliance who argued that poor people without such documents would be unable to afford such a document, and thus wind up disenfranchised. The minister in charge of the election, √Öslaug Haga, prompted the local election authorities to exercise discretion, and aid people who need identification if necessary. It was also not necessary to have identification if the ballot recipient knew the voter and could vouch for him or her.-Fattige har ikke stemmerett (\\"The poor don't have the right to vote\\") NRK √òstlandssendingen, September 3, 2007 Voter turnout concerns Ahead of the election, it was feared that voter turnout would be lower than the 59% of the 2003 local elections, which was already low by Norwegian standards. Even so, a few days before the early voting deadline had past, about 291,200 ballots had been cast prior to the election, up from the 249,022 ballots cast in 2003.Low voter turnout predicted Aftenposten, September 6, 2007 The final result showed a turnout of 61.7% in the municipal election,Election results: municipal and 57.5% in the county election.Election results: county Results and response =Municipal elections= 2,209,706 valid votes were cast for the municipal elections, a turnout of 61.7%.

Most other main line parties could log slight gains or a result comparable with the previous election. Part of the explanation for SV's poor performance has been laid on their performance in the cabinet. In particular Helen Bj√∏rn√∏y, the minister of environmental affairs, and √òystein Djupedal, the minister of education and research have faced criticism. Bj√∏rn√∏y has been well respected, but has suffered due to having to make compromises on environmental issues, in particular to the Centre Party which favors rural development, often over conservation. Djupedal has had to contend with accusations of arrogance, and several teachers, who SV have traditionally fared well amongst, have complained about the lack of improvement in the country's education system. Also, SV's party leader and Norway's minister of finance, Kristin Halvorsen has been behind some unpopular economic measures.Government changes loom after election 'catastrophe' Aftenposten, September 11, 2007 Olav Gunnar Ballo, an SV member of parliament has called for the resignation of both Bj√∏rn√∏y and Djupedal,Krever hoderulling etter SV-fiaskoen Demands head rolling after SV fiasco, Aftenposten, September 11, but on the day after the election, Halvorsen announced that none of the SV cabinet members would be dismissed.Sparker ikke SV-ministre (\\"Will not fire SV ministers\\") NRK, September 11, 2007 Allegations of electoral fraud in Drammen In the municipal election in Drammen, it was revealed that a number of drug addicts had been offered 50 NOK (approximately 8 USD) if they would vote for the Labour Party, and with a personal vote for the candidate Yousuf Gilani.

The film was based on the historic Beefsteak Raid of September 1864 led by Confederate Major General Wade Hampton III. Plot Cattleman Alvarez Kelly (William Holden) is contracted to deliver a herd to the Union Army in Virginia. As he nears the end of his long cattle drive, Kelly is captured by Confederate raiders led by Colonel Tom Rossiter (Richard Widmark). The Confederacy desperately needs the beef to feed its soldiers besieged in Richmond. Kelly is \\"persuaded\\" to help shanghai and deliver the stolen herd to Richmond. Despite the hatred between the two men, they manage to work together. Kelly first teaches Rossiter's men how to drive cattle. Then, they proceed to capture and drive the herd away, despite the efforts of Union officer Major Albert Stedman (Patrick O'Neal). As revenge, Kelly arranges passage for Rossiter's discontented fianc√©e, Liz Pickering (Janice Rule), on a blockade runner leaving the besieged city.

Reception The film was generally well received by critics. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times remarked that it was \\"a good picture‚Äînice and crisp and tough\\", praised the script writer Franklin Coen for \\"blueprinting a fresh idea, and salting it with some tingling, unstereotyped behavior and gristly dialogue\\". He further praised the cinematography, the casting of Holden and Widmark, which he considered \\"sardonic perfection\\", and added that the \\"picture perks up beautifully in the ripely-detailed homestretch\\". Variety praised the action sequences with the cattle stampede but, unlike Crowther, thought there were some issues with the script which they believed \\"overdevelops some characters and situations, and underdevelops others\\". Author John H. Lenihan compares the film to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, in that both films \\"offer no consolation in their vivid deglamorization of war. The heroes, or antiheroes, of both films pursue selfish pecuniary ventures as a conscious alternative to becoming committed in a pointless destructive war\\".

He influenced improving military collaboration between Jordan and Turkey. He had been educated in Turkey and was fluent in the language.  Early life  Samkari was born in Irbid in 1942. He was educated there and finished high school when he was 16. He then enrolled in Engineering School in Istanbul, Turkey in 1959 where he met his future wife Enji Kanarya. His brothers were a major influence on him joining the Army as all three had served in the military; his oldest brother Yassin had served in the 1950s as a major in the cavalry. His brother Izzat had been a Brigadier General and director of the Jordanian Royal Medical Services. His younger brother Sameer had joined a few years earlier and was a Captain for the Royal Jordanian Air Force, before his death in a fighter jet crash while training in the United States in 1967  Education  Samkari attended Istanbul Technical University(1959‚Äì1965) where he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees in mechanical engineering.

Samkari's role as director came at a sensitive time. After the Gulf War, the face of the middle east had changed. Samkari reused parts and reassembled them, due to the shortage of spare parts. That changed by the time of the start of the peace talks between Jordan and Israel. By that time Jordan had started an era of sophisticated military force.  Role in military improvement  General Samkari was a member of the envoy to the Soviet Union which acquired Russian made anti aircraft weaponry, the ZSU-23-4 \\"Shilka\\" and the 9K33 Osa missiles and targeting radar.

He added that \\"we have also disrupted Shia militia extremists, capturing the head and numerous other leaders of the Iranian- supported Special Groups, along with a senior Lebanese Hezbollah operative supporting Iran's activities in Iraq.\\" He argued that Coalition and Iraqi operations had drastically reduced ethno-sectarian violence in the country, though he stated that the gains were not entirely even.

Three other government reports measuring progress in Iraq were commissioned prior to Petraeus' testimony. A Government Accountability Office report stated that the Iraqi Government did not meet 11 of the 18 benchmark measures as of August 30, 2007. On September 14, a White House survey reported \\"satisfactory\\" progress on 9 of the 18 benchmarks. Lionel Beehner of the nonpartisan Council of Foreign Relations has called the benchmarks \\"vague because the metrics to measure them are imprecise.\\" The New York Times stated on May 13 that \\"Nobody in Washington seems to agree on what progress actually means ‚Äì or how, precisely, it might be measured.\\" Petraeus has stated that his recommendations are not dependent on the Iraqi government's ability to meet the benchmarks.

This is part and parcel of a larger story.\\" Fellow Charles Kupchan argued that \\"The central issue is whether the surge shows signs of providing sufficient security in Baghdad and elsewhere to promote political stability, sectarian reconciliation, and functioning state institutions. The answer is unequivocally, \\"no.\\"\\" Fellow Stephen Biddle argued that \\"Monday's testimony yielded a mixed picture\\". Thomas Engelhardt wrote in left-liberal journal The Nation that \\"Numbers in Iraq are a slippery matter at best, though again, why anyone pays serious attention to US military numbers from that country is a mystery. On countless occasions in the past, these have been ridiculous undercounts of disaster.\\" The Washington Post stated on September 25 that \\"Apparent contradictions are relatively easy to find in the flood of bar charts and trend lines the military produces.

An early September CNN poll found that 53% did not believe the General's report would be \\"independent and objective\\"; an August USA Today poll stated the same thing. A mid-September Pew Research Center survey found that, of everyone who has heard of his report, 57% support his recommendations. The survey also stated that 32% of Americans have not heard of the report and that, overall, the President's address and Petraeus' report did not change minds about the surge. Another Pew Research Center survey found that 18% of Americans want to remove all troops immediately, 18% support a gradual withdrawal over the next two years, 39% support keeping troops in, and 7% feel unsure. A late-September ABC News poll asked about Petraeus' recommendations without mentioning him by name. The poll reported that 43% of Americans think the number of troops should be reduced \\"more quickly\\", 12% \\"more slowly\\", and 38% agree with the recommendations.

The poll also found that 43% think that the troop increase is \\"making the situation there better\\".\\"Progress in Iraq reshapes debate over war\\". USA Today. Published February 18, 2008. Iraqi public opinion The New York Times has stated that Iraqis viewed the report ambivalently, but that most believed it accurately portrayed the situation on the ground. A BBC News poll published the day of Petraeus' testimony reported that 70% of Iraqis believe that the surge has worsened conditions in the country. It also reported that over 90% of Iraqi Sunnis consider attacks on American forces acceptable while 50% of Iraqi Shia do.

Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix.) is a clade or family of derived titanosaur sauropods that lived during the Early Cretaceous and Late Cretaceous. The group was defined by Unchurch et al. in 2004 as the most recent common ancestor of Malawisaurus and Saltasaurus and all the descendants of that ancestor. Lithostrotia is derived from the Ancient Greek , meaning \\"inlaid with stones\\", referring to the fact that many known lithostrotians are preserved with osteoderms. However, osteoderms are not a distinguishing feature of the group, as the two noted by Unchurch et al. include caudal vertebrae with strongly concave front faces (procoely), although the farthest vertebrae are not procoelous. History of research In 1895, Richard Lydekker named the family Titanosauridae to summarize sauropods with procoelous (concave on the front) caudal vertebrae. The name Titanosauridae has since been widely used, and was defined by Salgado and colleagues (1997), Gonzalaz-Riga (2003) and Salgado (2003) as node-based taxon. According to a proposal by Wilson and Upchurch (2003) looks today much of the research on the use of that name from: Wilson and Upchurch published a revision of the genus Titanosaurus and declare the type species Titanosaurus indicus as invalid because it is based only on two vertebrae of the tail, showing no diagnostically usable features. Consistently these authors consider ranking groups that are based on Titanosaurus as the nominal taxon, Titanosauridae, Titanosaurinae and Titanosauroidea - also considered invalid. In 2004 Upchurch and colleagues presented the new group Lithostrotia to describe the same group as Titanosauridae, but instead it was not based upon a specific taxon. The name Lithostrotia is not currently recognized by all researchers. Definition and synapomorphies Caudal vertebrae of Malawisaurus (top right) and Saltasaurus (bottom) compared with Tornieria Upchurch and colleagues (2004) define the Lithostrotia as a node-based taxon that includes the last common ancestor of Malawisaurus and Saltasaurus and all descendants of that ancestor. According to this definition the Lithostrotia includes all forms that are more derived than Malawisaurus in phylogenies. In addition to defining the group Upchurch and colleagues gave two common derived features (synapomorphies), which serve to distinguish the group from non-members. The first is that all caudal vertebrae apart from the farthest distal were procoelous, meaning their front face was concave. Also, the front (proximal) caudal vertebrae were particularly strong procoelous. This first feature is also shared with Mamenchisauridae. Unchurch et al. named Lithostrotia based on the presence of osteoderms in many members, but the eponymous osteoderms do not represent synapomorphy, as the evolutionary history of osteoderms is unknown within the titanosaurs. It may be this trait has developed multiple times independently within the titanosaurs and Lithostrotia, as osteoderms are known in many saltasaurids, Mendozasaurus, Aeolosaurus, Ampelosaurus and various other genera both within and outside Lithostrotia with different morphologies. Systematics Malawisaurus skeleton, Royal Ontario Museum Lithostrotia is a derived group of titanosaurs, excluding primitive forms such as Andesaurus and Phuwiangosaurus. The possibly equivalent clade Titanosauridae was positioned in a phylogenetic analysis by Calvo et al. (2007), where it included all titanosaurs apart from Andesaurus, though multiple primitive forms were not analyzed. Other phylogenies, by Unchurch et al. (2015), instead have found a few, non-lithostrotian titanosaurs, or nearly all non-brachiosaurid titanosauriformes within the group. Poropat et al. (2015) conducted a similar analysis to one of Unchurch et al. (2015). This analysis found that Andesaurus, Argentinosaurus and Epachthosaurus were within Titanosauria but outside Lithostrotia, and the latter group included Malawisaurus, Nemegtosaurus, Diamantinasaurus, Tapuiasaurus and Alamosaurus as basal lithostrotians outside Saltasauridae. The results of their analysis is shown below. Another phylogenetic analysis in 2016, partially reproduced below, found Diamantinasaurus as a non-lithostrotian titanosaur and the sister taxon of the contemporary Savannasaurus.

Until 9 March 2009, the complex was operated by the RASCO, a subsidiary of the National Oil Corporation. The current operator is the Libyan Emirates Oil Refining Company. History The Ra's Lanuf Refinery became operational during 1984. In 2007, the decision to expand the refinery for the production of benzene, butadiene, and MTBE was made. For this, NOC concluded a contract to establish a joint venture with Dow Chemical Company. In 2008, a $2 billion contract with the Star Consortium, comprising the Al Ghurair's subsidiary TransAsia Gas International and ETA Ascon Star Group's Star Petro Energy, to own and upgrade the refinery was concluded. However, in March 2009, NOC and Al Ghurair's subsidiary Trusta signed an agreement to form a joint venture the Libyan Emirati Refining Company (Lerco) to operate and upgrade the refinery. Additional storage tanks were to be built by Vitol, with the expansion expected to be completed by 2013. Description The refinery has a capacity of . It is a simple hydroskimming refinery, but its products meet market specifications due to the use of high quality crude oil. It produces fuel oil, gas oil, naphtha and kerosene. The complex also produces petrochemicals, utilizing naphtha as a feed stock for an ethylene plant with a capacity of 1.2 million tons per year (tpy). Its main products are ethylene (330,000 tpy), propylene (170,000 tpy), Mix C4 (130,000 tpy) and P Gasoline (335,000 tpy).

Energy Information Administration. July 24, 2007 Background The first construction phase for the Ra's Lanuf petrochemical complex began during April 1987. Rasco contracted Hemijska Industria Pancevo (Yugoslavia) to manage the complex. During the first two years production was well below capacity. It began increasing in 1989 and by 1994 operated at about 85% of capacity. The operation was impacted by UN sanctions, specifically Security Council Resolution 883 of November 11, 1993, which banned Libya from importing refinery equipment. Performance improved after the UN suspended sanctions in April 1999. The ethylene cracker was closed for a four-week maintenance in May 1999. The second phase was scheduled to finish in 1994, with Monenco as manager. However, the venture ran into numerous obstacles. In 1985, Tecnimont won a $50 million management contract, but when the contract expired in 1990, Rasco appointed Monenco. In October 1989, the first contract was awarded to a consortium consisting of Energoinvest, Hemijska Industria Pancevo, INA-Project and Brown & Root. In 1990, Brown & Root ended its participation and was replaced by Technip. In February 1991, Hyundai Engineering and Construction was awarded a $200 million contract for the polyethlene unit, with John Brown Engineering acting as sub- contractor. Included in the contract was a hydrogen and ethylene purification unit. By the end of 1992, Uhde GmbH (German subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp) won the contract. In 1993, Rasco terminated the construction contract due to the consortia failure to fulfill its terms. Expansion During early June 2007, National Oil Corporation was evaluating investment proposals for upgrading Ra's Lanuf. The total cost of the upgrade is estimated at $2 billion. These expansions will permit the production of benzene, butadiene, and methyl tert- butyl ether. On April 19, 2007, National Oil Corporation and the Dow Chemical Company announced plans to participate in a joint venture to operate and expand the Ra's Lanuf complex.Libya‚Äôs NOC and Dow Chemical Co., Announce Joint Venture Plans To Expand Petrochemical Complex April 18, 2007 The joint venture agreement encompasses the Ra's Lanuf site's existing naphtha cracker, two polyethylene production facilities and associated infrastructure. The project will include refurbishment and expansion of the existing units, followed by construction of an ethane cracker and additional polyethylene and polypropylene facilities. Later phases will include construction of additional hydrocarbon, plastics and chemical production facilities based on natural gas.

View south along US 1 Alt. and west along US 50 in Washington, D.C. ;Route description In the District of Columbia, U.S. 1 Alternate splits from U.S. 1 at New York Avenue, following U.S. Route 50 east. U.S. 1 Alternate then turns on to Bladensburg Road, which it travels into Prince George's County, Maryland. After passing through Colmar Manor and Cottage City, the road enters Bladensburg and turns onto Baltimore Avenue toward Hyattsville, where it rejoins U.S. 1 at Rhode Island Avenue. US 1 Alternate crosses Eastern Avenue NE and enters the state of Maryland from the District of Columbia in Prince George's County. The route heads northeast along the partially four-lane divided Bladensburg Road passing industrial areas and warehouses on the northwest and the Fort Lincoln Funeral Home and Cemetery on the southeast straddling the southeastern boundary of the town of Cottage City. US 1 Alternate crosses over Dueling Creek adjacent to the Bladensburg Dueling Grounds on the southeast before heading into a commercial area where the route begins to follow the northwestern boundary of the town of Colmar Manor. In this area, the route insects the southern terminus of Maryland Route 208 (38th Street), before continuing along the town line and passing through a mix of residential and commercial areas. US 1 Alternate leaves the boundary between Colmar Manor and Cottage City as it crosses over the Anacostia River just to the southeast of the confluence between its Northeast and Northwest Branches and enters the town of Bladensburg. Immediately after crossing the river, the route's median for its directional Y intersection with the eastern terminus of MD 450 (Annapolis Road), which is the old alignment of US 50 in the capital region of Maryland which heads east into downtown Bladensburg. In the middle of the insection is a Maryland memorial for World War I soldiers known as the Peace Cross. Past MD 450, US 1 Alternate curves north and its name changes to Baltimore Avenue passing industrial areas on the east and the Old Port of Bladensburg Community Park on the west. The route leaves Bladensburg at its crossing over the Northeast Branch and enters the city of Hyattsville. The route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and continues through a mix of residential, commercial, and industrial areas. US 1 Alternate reaches an at-grade railroad crossing with a component of the wye junction between CSX's Capital Subdivision line and its Alexandria Extension. A short distance past the crossing, the route enters a long bridge with a sweeping curve that crosses over the Capital Subdivision before the route reaches its northern terminus at US 1 (Baltimore Avenue) in downtown Hyattsville. Baltimore Avenue turns northward on US 1, taking over that route name from US 1 Alternate through the northern suburbs of Prince George's County including Riverdale Park, University Park, College Park, Beltsville, and Laurel. View north along US 1 Alt. at MD 208 in Colmar Manor ;History In the 1940s, this route was known as Bypass US 1, and was cosigned with U.S. Route 50 Alternate and Maryland Route 411. ;Major intersections =Baltimore alternate route= U.S. Route 1 Alternate is a long alternate route forming a loop off US 1 between Arbutus and Baltimore, Maryland.

The entire length of US 1 Bus. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. In 2003, a western bypass of Swainsboro was proposed. The next year, US 1/SR 4 were shifted onto this bypass. Their former path through the city was redesignated as US 1 Bus./SR 4 Bus. =Wadley business loop= U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) is a business route of US 1 that is mostly within the city limits of Wadley. It is concurrent with U.S. Route 1 Business (US 1 Bus.) for its entire length.

He served as Minister of Culture (1976‚Äì1980), Minister of Education (1980‚Äì1982) and Minister of State (1988‚Äì1990). He was also a Member of Parliament from 1983 to 1994. Life and career =Career in the Communist Party= Pozsgay was born in K√≥ny on 26 November 1933 as the son of tailor Imre Pozsgay, Sr. (died 1938) and housewife Roz√°lia L√©n√°rt.Visszatekint√©s a rendszerv√°lt√°sra (Magyar Sz√≥ ‚Äì Issue 79. March 2005) After finishing elementary and secondary studies in Enying and Fert≈ëd, respectively, he joined the Hungarian Working People's Party (MDP) in 1950 which had established a Communist one-party system by then. In 1951, he became head of the Balatonbozsok (today part of Enying) party branch. Following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Pozsgay became a member of the reorganized state party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party (MSZMP). After that he graduated with an English degree from the Lenin Institute in Budapest, which belonged to the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. During that time he published an article for Pet≈ëfi N√©pe on 15 December 1957 about the 1956 uprising under the title \\"Revolution or Counter-revolution?\\". Therein he called the 1956 events as a \\"pure counter-revolution\\", which tried to restore the \\"capitalist conditions and the bourgeois rule\\". Imre Nagy was characterized by Pozsgay as an \\"unprincipled\\" person who became Prime Minister \\"in the days of the raging White Terror\\". Between 1957 and 1965, he functioned as Director of the MSZMP B√°cs-Kiskun County Committee's Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Evening University. Between 1965 and 1968, he was Head of the Agitation and Propaganda Department of the local county branch. Until 1969, he served as Secretary of the party's B√°cs- Kiskun County branch. After that he was appointed Head of the Central Committee's Press Department. From 1971 to 1975, he was Deputy Editor in Chief of T√°rsadalmi Szemle. He defended his C.Sc. thesis in philosophy in 1970. In 1975, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Culture under L√°szl√≥ Orb√°n in the cabinet of Prime Minister Gy√∂rgy L√°z√°r. In the next year he was promoted to Minister of Culture, replacing Orb√°n. In June 1980, his ministry was merged into the Ministry of Education, his responsibilities conferred with education and cultural affairs after that. Beside his ministership, he also became a member of the MSZMP's Central Committee. As minister, he established the independent Katona J√≥zsef Theatre in 1982. In 1982, his calls for reform (which he describes in his book Turning Point and Reform) led to a falling-out with the party's leader J√°nos K√°d√°r which in turn moved Pozsgay to become Secretary-General of the party's mass organization, the Patriotic People's Front (HNF) under President Gyula K√°llai. In 1983, he was elected to the National Assembly of Hungary during a by-election. In the 1985 parliamentary election, he became MP from the party's national list. Returning to the government sphere, he became Minister of State in the cabinets of K√°roly Gr√≥sz then Mikl√≥s N√©meth from 1988 to 1990. He was also a member of the Politburo until its dissolution in 1989, and Chairman of the College of Political Communication, Political Science and Nationalities. On 28 January 1989, Pozsgay, as the first from ruling party, stunned the Communist establishment by labelling the 1956 Hungarian revolution not a counterrevolution but a \\"popular uprising\\".\\"Hungary.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Pozsgay participated in the reburial of Imre Nagy in June 1989, which proved to be a catalyst event; the hard-line K√°roly Gr√≥sz was outranked by a four-member collective presidency (included Pozsgay) of the reformist wing within the MSZMP on 26 June 1989. The ruling communist party began discussions with the opposition groups within the framework of the so-called Round Table Talks. Jointly with Otto von Habsburg, Imre Pozsgay was the sponsor of the Pan- European Picnic of 19 August 1989, where hundreds of East Germans who were visiting Hungary were able to cross the previously impenetrable Iron Curtain into Austria. The question of the post-communist presidential position was one of the most problematic disputes between the parties. The MSZMP suggested a directly elected semi-presidential system. However, this proposal was strongly opposed by the sharply anti-communist SZDSZ and Fidesz. They presumed that Pozsgay, the country's most popular politician at the time, would win any ensuing election. Following collecting signatures by Fidesz and SZDSZ, a four- part referendum was held on 26 November 1989, where the voters chose \\"yes\\" for the question of \\"Should the president be elected after parliamentary election?\\" and also adopted a system in which the president would be indirectly elected by parliament. Pozsgay had donated his personal documents and records to the Hoover Institution Library and Archives in 1989, and authorized the institution to make them public after twenty years, in 2009. Richard Sousa, director of the Institution, estimated that Pozsgay will be recognized by history as a leader who helped the transition to democracy in his country. =After the transition to democracy= In October 1989, the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party renamed itself the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and announced Poszgay as their Deputy President. He was the party's candidate for the position of President of Hungary in 1990. He was elected MP from the MSZP's B√°cs-Kiskun County Regional List, after defeated by J√≥zsef Sz√°jer (Fidesz) in Sopron constituency (Gy≈ër-Moson-Sopron County VII). He served as leader of its parliamentary group from May until November 1990, when he quit the caucus and the party itself, and became an independent MP. In May 1991, Pozsgay formed a new party, which he headed himself alongside Zolt√°n B√≠r√≥, called the National Democratic Alliance. The NDSZ, which had a third way ideology and advocated a varying synthesis of right-wing economic and left- wing social policies, have failed to win any seats in the 1994 parliamentary election, receiving only 0.52 percent of the vote. After that the party dissolved on 20 January 1996. From 1996 to 2001, he was a member of the presidium of the World Federation of Hungarians (MVSZ). Since 1991, he had been teaching at the University of Debrecen (formerly Kossuth Lajos University). He was also a lecturer at the K√°roli G√°sp√°r University of the Reformed Church in Hungary since 2003. Beside that he was also Rector of the Saint Ladislaus Academy between 1995 and 2000. He received Hungarian Heritage Award in 2003. In 2012, he founded a journal St√°dium in Sz√°zhalombatta. In 2015, he was awarded Saint Stephen Prize. Pozsgay became an adviser to the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) in 1997, he was also the party's candidate in the 1998 parliamentary election but did not gain a mandate. He returned to the political sphere in 2005, when he became a member of the National Consultation Body led by Viktor Orb√°n, the President of Fidesz. In 2010, a new government led by Fidesz initiated a drafting process for a new constitution. Pozsgay became a member of the board advising Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n on the conceptual foundations of the new fundamental law. Death Imre Pozsgay died on 25 March 2016, at the age of 82, his family told Magyar T√°virati Iroda. In a statement, the Fidesz‚ÄìKDNP government sent its condolences to his family, and noted Pozsgay's \\"inevitable\\" role in the transition process to democracy. According to the statement, Pozsgay \\"despite his major role in the Communist and Socialist parties, had a commitment to the future of the country and its people\\". Awards In 2010 Pozsgay received the Dr.Rainer Hildebrandt Human Rights Award endowed by Alexandra Hildebrandt. The award is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, non-violent commitment to human rights.

It aired on MBC from July 26 to September 14, 2006 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 16 episodes. Synopsis Over the Rainbow is about three people who love to dance. Jeong Hee-su ran away from her father in New Zealand and tried to make a go as a singer in Seoul. She ended up renting a room in Kwon Hyeok-ju's home and helped him realized his talent in dancing. Her main goal was to become famous and for that she turned to the famous singer Rex and dumped her boyfriend Hyeok-ju. Rex didn't mind being used and helped her along even though Hee-su wasn't that talented. Then there was this oddball, Sang-mi, who was a huge fan of Rex. She was poor but full of passion for doing the things she loved. At first, she was despised by everyone but bit by bit she won people over. Hyeok- ju began to develop feelings for her. Things went crazy when Rex started to fall for Sang-mi. Hyeok-ju and his group, Gangster, are signed on to Pride, the company of which Rex and Hee-su are part of. They are signed on because Rex's popularity is falling because his fans feel that he doesn't have as much passion in his singing as he used to have. Sang-mi was the stylist for Gangster when they were still anonymous, but the president of Pride didn't let her be their stylist anymore, so she instead became Rex's stylist, after an intense scene between Sang-mi and Rex, which Hyeok-ju was not pleased about. Hee-su destroys her own career by singing live, since she cannot sing well, and it is difficult to sing and dance at the same time. She takes pills and is almost in critical condition. Hyeok-ju rushes to the hospital, and Sang-mi follows, and Rex tries to stop her. When she insists on going, he takes her there in his car. Hyeok-ju and Hee-su reconcile, and Sang-mi walks into the hospital room when they are hugging and Hee-su is crying. She feels like an outsider and leaves, and Rex, seeing her face, takes her to a karaoke place. He sings her his song \\"Tomorrow\\" and puts his arm around her while she cries but tries to smile at the same time. Eventually Rex falls in love with Sang- mi, but Sang-mi is still in love with Hyeok-ju.

He is known for having tried to incorporate Tahiti to the Spanish seaborne empire. His father, Juan Bauptista de Bonechea Aramburu (1685‚Äì1770), son of Geronimo Boneachea and Mariana Aramburu, commanded the fishing vessel Terranova off Nova Scotia in 1727 became a captain in the Spanish Royal Navy, and was Alcalde (mayor) of Getaria in 1756; his uncle Francisco de Bonechea Aramburu was a frigate captain. His mother was Francisca Andonaegui Narbasta; the parents married on 25 March 1714, a few months after Domingo's birth. His younger brother Francisco Bonechea Andonaegui was also a naval officer, mentioned as a lieutenant aboard one of the frigates that escorted Carlos III from Italy to Spain in 1759 on his accession to the Spanish throne. He was a cousin of the explorer Manuel Facundo Agote Bonechea 1755-1803), with whom he corresponded. Domingo de Bonechea Andonaegui did not pass through naval college or formal navigational studies. He served in the Spanish navy as a pilot from 1732 to 1740, when he became midshipman (Alferez) of a frigate. He took part in the Battle of Toulon (22/23 February 1744) He was promoted to Midshipman of a Ship of the Line in 1749 and to Frigate lieutenant in 1751. In 1754 he was promoted to lieutenant of a ship of the line. His first command seems to have been the Corvette Maite (18)in which he took part in the action in which Spain lost Havana to the British Admiral Pocock in 1762. After a desperate action on June 28 against the British Captain George Mackenzie he surrendered at Mariel together with the Virganza (24) commanded by Diego Argote. He was exonerated of all blame and acquitted with honour. In 1766 he became a frigate captain and from 1767 commanded the frigate Santa Maria Magdalena, afterwards renamed Aguila. Together with the Lievre, he took supplies to the Falkland Islands and reached the port of Concepcion (Chile) on 14 April 1768. From there he continued on to Callao (Peru) and seems to have remained in the region for several years. Domingo de Bonechea's exploratory voyages were commissioned by the Viceroy of Peru, Manuel de Amat y Juniet, who was concerned that Captain Cook's explorations might lead to the creation of British bases from which to attack Peru. De Bonechea reached Tahiti only weeks after Cook's First Voyage, and indeed found an axe left there by Cook's expedition. He recorded a great many local native words. First voyage (1772‚Äì1773) On September 26, 1772, de Bonechea went on an exploratory expedition to Tahiti. He sailed with Tom√°s Gayangos as his lieutenant on the Aguila, Santa Maria Magdalena, from Callao harbour, Peru, and reached Tahiti on 7 Nov. He anchored in Vaiuru's Bay, which de Bonechea christened \\"Puerto Santa Maria Magdalena\\". De Bonechea forbade himself and his crew any sexual relations with local women, which surprised the Tahitians greatly. He left Tahiti on December 20 and reached Valpara√≠so on February 21, 1773. Georg Forster, who accompanied Cook on his Second Voyage, refers to him as \\"Domingo Buenechea\\". Second Voyage (1774‚Äì1775) The aim of this expedition was the annexation of Tahiti to the Spanish crown, with the approval and encouragement of King Carlos III, and to convert its inhabitants. Two ships, the Aguila and the Jupiter left Callao on September 20, 1774. Bonechea and Tu decided a place within 150 yards of the Vaitepiha River, in Vaitepiha Bay, was the best place for a mission. This area is now known as Tautira Bay, but referred to by the Spanish as 'La Santissima Cruz de Ohatutira'. However, de Bonechea died on 26 January 1775, in Tahiti, and buried near the Holy Cross marking Spain's dominion over the island, near the mission house. The mission was abandoned on 12 November, however. The cross, with the inscription Christus Vincit Carolus III imperat 1774, was taken down by the British in 1777. His grave was rediscovered in the 20th century in the village of Tautira.

Known for his skills in oratory and elocution, he also taught public speaking and drama, and was known as a \\"public reciter.\\" A native and lifelong resident of the greater Boston area, he was described by Time magazine as a \\"professional director of civic and patriotic shows.\\" By the mid-1920s, Burrell had developed a nationwide reputation for his work, having had 75,000 participants in his productions, which had collectively been performed in front of over 900,000 people. According to a printed program used at a service in his memory, \\"His mastery of the spoken and written word led him to be a well known public speaker with an enviable reputation as a teacher of oratory, and later as an author and director of national distinction.\\"Program for Memorial Service, October 2, 2004. Burrell served as the first supreme historian of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity from 1901 to 1903, and the sixth supreme (national) president of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity from 1907 to 1914, and along with fraternity founder Ossian E. Mills has been credited by fraternity historians with encouraging the early expansion of and formulating the basic ideals espoused by the fraternity. Much of this fundamental philosophy is encapsulated in his presidential messages expounding the fraternity's Object, which appeared in the Sinfonia Yearbooks between 1908 and 1910. Today, these writings are regularly used to instruct the fraternity's probationary members about the fraternity's Object, and the obligations and expectations of fraternity membership. Early life and education Born to Joseph and Alice Burrell of the Beacon Hill area of Boston on February 10, 1877, Percy Burrell attended the Phillips Grammar School in Boston, from which he graduated in 1891, and the English High School of Boston, from which he graduated in 1894. He studied oratory at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, graduating with a Diploma in Elocution in 1896. He later received the post-graduate degree of Bachelor of Oratory (B.O.) from Boston University, where he later took coursework in Methodist theology, and was initiated into Boston University's chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Burrell maintained a connection to the New England Conservatory for many years. He was called upon to serve as commencement speaker at the Conservatory in 1908, and was published several times in the New England Conservatory Quarterly. His writings at that time advocated the teaching of oratory in the public schools.http://www.sinfonia.org/Resources/writings/Burrell/BurrellAdditional/Burrell11-00-1908.pdf In 1897, he had published a sixteen-page work entitled Oratory in the Public Schools. As of 1910, Burrell was serving as a trustee of the conservatory.The Directory of Directors in the City of Boston and Vicinity, p. 67. As of 1951, Burrell was serving as an associate editor of Alumni Opus, a publication of the New England Conservatory Alumni Association.https://www.consortiumlibrary.org/archives/CollectionsInv/STtoUSArmy/Talleybbgdbflst.html Early Leadership in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity Burrell was initiated into Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia's Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory on June 12, 1899, and soon thereafter was elected as the chapter's second president in January 1900. His leadership was significant as the fraternity had only recently been founded at the Conservatory eight months earlier, during the previous school year in October 1898; it would not be until two years later, in 1901, that a National or \\"Supreme\\" President would be elected. Thus, he was in a position to influence the direction of the fraternity as it grew from the campus of the conservatory to other campuses, initially to the Broad Street Conservatory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the American Institute of Applied Arts in New York City, New York in the fall of 1900. He served as Supreme (or National) Historian from 1901 to 1903. At the seventh national convention, held in Boston in 1907, he was elected Supreme President, and served in this role until 1914. Serving as president for seven years, he holds the third longest tenure in this role, behind Richard Crosby (nine years, non-consecutive) and Archie N. Jones (ten years, consecutive). During the years of his supreme presidency, the Fraternity expanded to include chapters at the University of Missouri, Northwestern University, Peabody Conservatory of Music, De Pauw University, the University of Oklahoma, Denison University, the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music, and the University of Kansas. For more specific information on the specific chapters and campuses involved, see {Chapters of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia}. During this period, the modern pin was adopted, the coat-of-arms was adopted, the first pledge pin was adopted, and the membership shingle was adopted. Protocol for the appropriate manner by which to wear the Fraternity pin was established in 1909 and the Fraternity's composition contest was launched in 1912. Burrell also wrote the lyrics to the song \\"The Mystic Cat\\", with music composed by American composer George Whitefield Chadwick, director of the New England Conservatory from 1897 to 1930 and the second honorary member of the fraternity, which appeared in the 1908 edition of the Fraternity's songbook, the first such book issued by the Fraternity. He also wrote the lyrics to the song \\"Alma Mater\\" for the 1914 edition of the songbook, with music by fellow Alpha Chapter brother Charles H. Doersam. He was listed in the 1915 edition of Leading Greeks: An Encyclopedia of the Workers in the American College Fraternities and Sororities, edited by William Collin Levere. Professional accomplishments In his book American Historical Pageantry: The Uses of Tradition in the Early Twentieth Century, David Glassberg notes that Burrell was one of thirteen dramatists employed as field workers by the Department of Community Drama in a program called Community Service, Inc. Such field workers helped local Community Service \\"chapters establish amateur dramatic programs.\\"Glassberg, p. 235. Burrell was affiliated with this program as of 1921. According to Martha Candler's book Drama in Religious Service (1922), Burrell helped conduct six-week drama institutes in Boston and New York for those involved in church related drama.Martha Candler, Drama in Religious Service (1922), p. 125, p. 128. From approximately 1917 to 1945, Burrell was in high demand throughout the United States and, according to Mongiovi, \\"stood preeminent in his profession as a consultant, author, organizer and director of historical and patriotic pageants and community and religious drama\\" by the 1930s.Jewett family newsletter article by John Mongiovi. Dr. Albert Bushnell Hart, Professor- Emeritus of History at Harvard University called Burrell ‚Äúthe master pageant- master,‚Äù and fellow American dramatist Percy MacKaye said of Burrell, ‚ÄúI know of no other person who combines his mastery of minutiae with the kind of human idealism necessary for projecting such phases of community art.‚Äù Burrell's historically themed pageants were often performed outdoors in stadiums, football fields, and even on battlefields. The topic was usually related to a significant historical milestone of the city or region in which the pageant was produced. His works might be considered predecessors to the outdoor dramas that Kermit Hunter, author of Unto These Hills and Horn in the West, and Paul Green, author of The Lost Colony, were later known for. Although his work took him throughout the country, much of his work was centered in New England and surrounding states. According to David Walbert, Burrell's works utilized \\"classical allusion and poetry to edify as well as entertain audiences.\\"David Walbert, Garden Spot: Lancaster County, the Old Order Amish, and the Settling of Rural America, p.42. Walbert further described Burrell's pageants as productions that should \\"transform a 'city of strangers' into a 'community of neighbors' - a genteel alternative to the '100% Americanism' of the early 1920s that sparked divisiveness and xenophobia in the wake of the First World War. Instead of warding off dangerous outsiders, historical pageants stressed unity and identification with community by building pride in common achievement.\\"Walbert, p, 42. One of Burrell's first works was Hope Valley, which was described as a \\"rural musical play\\" and a \\"charming musical comedy\\" set in a New England country village, was premiered at the New England Conservatory in April 1910 ([ibid.]). According to Glassberg, Burrell began to gain a reputation in the 1910s directing pageants of a religious nature (Glassberg, p. 235). Burrell collaborated with Oliver Huckel in 1913 on Four Epochs of World Conquest, a work designed to support participants in the pageant \\"The Pageant of Darkness and Light.\\" Among his early works are The Pioneer Pageant: How the West Was Won (1924), which was a collaboration with Stephen B. L. Penrose (then president of Whitman College), and was produced in Walla Walla, Washington. The Pageant of Saratoga, produced on October 8, 1927 on the Saratoga, New York battlefield, had 6,500 participants and 125,000 spectators making it \\"the largest historical spectacle of its type ever given in the country at the time.\\"Jewett Family newsletter. The Pageant of Wyoming Valley was produced in 1928 to commemorate the one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the battle of Wyoming Valley. The Pageant of New Brunswick: the Drama on the Highway was produced at Rutgers University in October 1930. Burrell produced Pageant of Colorado, a work with music composed by Charles Wakefield Cadman, in Denver, Colorado in May 1927. Also that year, he produced The York Pageant: How the American Federation Was Founded, in collaboration with Lillian White Spencer and Alice Kraft Burrell produced two pageants during the 1920s at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The Pageant of Liberty: Commemorating Lancaster Pennsylvania in the American Revolution was produced in July 1926 on the one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Described as a ‚Äústupendous historical spectacle‚Äù, the work depicted Lancaster‚Äôs role in the fight for independence. The York Pageant was produced in York, Pennsylvania, in 1927. The Pageant of Gratitude: For two hundred years of blessing upon Lancaster County was a ten-act work produced in June 1929. Written and directed by Burrell in collaboration with Alice Kraft and Harry A. Sykes, the production featured over 3,000 participants and included drama, dance, and music. The pageant is described in detail in David Walbert's book Garden Spot: Lancaster County, the Old Order Amish, and the Settling of Rural America. In 1929, Burrell served as general director of New York State's one-hundred-fiftieth anniversary Sullivan Expedition pageants. By the 1930s, over 100,000 persons had come under his guidance as pageant participants and committee members, and over 1,200,000 spectators had seen his productions.Jewett Family newsletter article by J. Mongiovi. During the 1930s, he authored Pageant of Time: An Adventure of Education in the Realm of Leisure; an allegory (1930). In 1930, he served as pageantry advisor for the Massachusetts Bay Tercentenary. In 1932, he served as a pageant consultant to the United States Commission on the two-hundredth anniversary of the birth of George Washington. In 1934, he adapted Matthew Page Andrews' Soul of Maryland:Pageant of the Founding for performance in Baltimore Stadium (Library of Congress Catalog). The work was a celebration of the \\"sesqui-centennial of Methodism.\\" In 1935 he authored America‚Äôs Making in Connecticut (the more complete title of which is The Connecticut Tercentenary Commission offers America's making in Connecticut: A pageant of the races), and The Pageant of Hingham, a work celebrating the three-hundredth anniversary of Hingham, Massachusetts (Library of Congress Catalog). A pageant that perhaps received the most widespread attention in the national media was his Glory of the Light: The Drama of Missions, a production sponsored by the Episcopal Church, which utilized the talents of 1,300 actors, was produced in Philadelphia in 1937, and received coverage in Time magazine. Following its initial production in Philadelphia, it was produced in Cincinnati as part of the triennial Episcopal General Convention. The Cincinnati cast included Charles Phelps Taft II, son of former U.S. President William Howard Taft. Towards the close of World War II, he produced Watchers of the World, which was described as \\"a dramatic ritual in honor of the living who serve and in tribute to the fallen in the cause of the United nations, a ceremonial for dedication of service flag, honor roll and for [M]emorial [D]ay\\" in 1944([Library of Congress Catalog]). This was followed in 1945 with For Freedom‚Äôs Sake!, \\"a pageant of the people in three actions: In celebration of victory; In gratitude for peace; In consecration to freedom\\" (Library of Congress catalog). Later involvement in Sinfonia The extent of Burrell's involvement in Sinfonia between after the conclusion of his term as Supreme President in 1914 and 1948 is not clear, though periodically there appeared references to him in the annual publications. Both he and 1922‚Äì1928 Supreme President Peter Dykema were associated with the organization Community Service so it is possible that their paths crossed in that context. To help commemorate Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia's 50th anniversary in 1948, Burrell authored Sinfonia Birthday, which was described as \\"An Historical Play based upon facts of the founding of Phi Mu Alpha Fraternity.\\"http://www.sinfonia.org/Resources/writings/Burrell/SinfoniaBirthday.pdf Although the work had a somewhat humorous tone, and although it is possible that the author took dramatic licence with this work, the play has been used to help form an understanding of the fraternity's earliest years by fraternity historians, and was a source for the fraternity's Centennial History, authored by Dr. T. Jervis Underwood. A photograph in a Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia magazine showed Burrell at the 1948 national fraternity convention assisting in the presentation of a commemorative gavel made of wood taken from the . The gavel continues to be used today during the Fraternity's triennial national conventions and is stored at the fraternity's national headquarters, Lyrecrest, in Evansville, Indiana, when not in use. He also spoke at the 1952 national convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, which is believed to be his last visit to a national fraternity event. A photograph in the fraternity's archives taken at the convention - possibly the last known picture of Burrell at a national fraternity event - shows him presenting a photograph of the first National Convention held in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1901. While the archives contain no official explanation of his intentions in presenting the picture, some believe that he did so as a reminder of the fraternity's early days, of which he was an integral part. The photograph is on display at Lyrecrest. Death and posthumous honors Burrell died at the age of 87 in 1964, and was buried in what would for many years be an unmarked grave in Watertown, Massachusetts, on the outskirts of Boston. Throughout most of the twentieth century, his role in the early development of the philosophies of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity was largely sidelined in fraternity publications and in the fraternity's ongoing philosophical dialogue. However, as the centennial of the fraternity approached in 1998, there was a revival of interest in the fraternity's original philosophies and values, much of which originated with Burrell as evidenced by his writings. After locating his grave in 1999, a fund-raising effort was undertaken by the fraternity's national historian to provide a monument for Burrell's burial site. The monument was dedicated by national fraternity leaders in a graveside ceremony on the morning of Saturday, October 2, 2004, as part of the fraternity's annual Founders Day observance. On the stone is inscribed the phrase used to describe Burrell: \\"Master Pageant Master.\\" Burrell has also been memorialized through the Burrell Award for Province Interaction, presented to fraternity chapters in the state of Virginia.http://www.mysticcat.org/~province18/media/documents/burrell_award.doc. In addition, The Percy is a traveling wooden trophy which one fraternity chapter retrieves from another chapter from time to time. The trophy is named in honor of Burrell because of his influence in the early expansion of the fraternity. It was established in February 1996 by Curtis Shirley, one of the pioneers of the Fraternity's CPR Council and the fraternity's Province 28 (made up of chapters in northern and central Indiana).

He commanded a naval squadron made of his flagship, the Delf√≠n de Escocia, and the Dobladilla, two 500 ton galleons. On 7 August 1604 he captured an English privateer at the Battle of the Gulf of C√°diz.Arzamendi Orbegozo, Ignacio (1981). El Almirante D. Antonio de Oquendo. Sociedad Guipuzcoana de Ediciones y Publicaciones, p. 130 At that time he was serving in the fleet of Admiral Luis Fajardo. In 1607 he was appointed commander of the Biscay squadron, which was that year enlarged and renamed the squadron of the Bay of Biscay. From the same year he also functioned as the General of the Fleet of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1619 he temporarily replaced Juan Fajardo de Tenza, 1st Marquess of Espinardo, arrested for insubordination, as commander of the Squadron of the Ocean, the Atlantic high seas navy. Ordered to be Fajardo's successor he refused, at the same time trying to make the government aware of the many shortcomings in the naval organisation; as a result he was himself incarcerated. Soon his imprisonment was changed for a forced stay in a convent. After a while Prince Philbert arranged his release; De Oquendo was then given command for a few years of the yearly Spanish treasure fleet, transporting the silver from the Andes to Spain. In 1624 he was brought to trial on accusations of fraud and nepotism but managed to show that the charges were fabricated by his enemies within the fleet. Nevertheless, he was barred from command of the treasure fleet for four years and condemned to pay an indemnity of 12,000 ducats for having caused the loss of the galleons Esp√≠ritu Santo and Sant√≠sima Trinidad near Cuba through neglect of duty. =Later promotions= In 1626 De Oquendo became Admiral-General of the Ocean Fleet, under Captain-General Fadrique de Toledo. In 1628 by his own initiative he relieved La M√°mora, at the time besieged by the Moors. In 1631 he commanded a troop convoy destined for Brazil, to retake the city of Pernambuco, the previous year conquered by the Dutch West India Company. On 12 September he engaged and defeated a Dutch WIC fleet under Admiral Adriaan Pater, allowing him to successfully land the troop contingent. The Spanish lost one vessel, the Dutch three. De Oquendo was now promoted to the highest rank, that of Captain-General. In 1636 he was arrested for duelling an Italian nobleman in Madrid. In 1637 he refused to reinforce the fleet of the Kingdom of Naples because his squadron was undermanned and poorly supplied. He was punished by being appointed governor of Mah√≥n, the capital of the island of Menorca. Role in the Battle of the Downs However, in 1639 the situation of Spain in the Thirty Years War strongly deteriorated. France had blocked the usual land route to the Army of Flanders and in August De Oquendo was made a viscount and given command of a large transport fleet to ship reinforcements from Cadiz to Dunkirk. On 15 September he was intercepted near the Strait of Dover by the squadron of Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, who was reinforced two days later by a flotilla of Vice-Admiral Witte de With. Though the Dutch force was rather small, consisting of only seventeen vessels, it managed by a clever use of the line-of-battle to severely damage the larger and crowded Spanish ships. De Oquendo feared that if he entered the narrow channel to Dunkirk, he would be trapped in that port, so he opted to take refuge in The Downs, in neutral English waters at the coast of Kent. As Charles I of England had concluded a secret treaty with Spain against the Dutch, De Oquendo hoped to move his troops to Flanders by means of English shipping. On 31 October the Dutch fleet, grown to over a hundred ships, violated English neutrality and attacked the Spanish fleet, succeeding in destroying or capturing many enemy vessels. De Oquendo himself escaped but was heavily wounded and morally broken. He never fully recovered. After his return to Spain he soon died in A Coru√±a.

Between 1946 and 1996, Edmonton's Charles Camsell Hospital was located in the neighbourhood. The hospital was named after Canadian geologist and map maker Charles Camsell. The neighbourhood is bounded on the north by 118 Avenue, on the south by 111 Avenue, on the west by Groat Road, and on the east by a former Canadian National Railway right of way. The community is represented by the Inglewood Community League, established in 1950, which maintains a community hall located at 125 Street and 116 Avenue.  History  As of 1882, portions of the present neighbourhood were owned by an employee of the Hudson's Bay fur trading company, operating a few kilometers away at Fort Edmonton. Located along the original St. Albert Trail, connecting the settlements of St. Albert and Edmonton, the area was used by M√©tis and First Nations peoples for their campsites when they came to do business in Edmonton. The majority of Inglewood was added to Edmonton during an annexation in 1904, with the portion west of 127 Street added in a 1908 annexation.

With a land area of , it had a population density of people/km2 in 2012.  Residential development  Residential development in Inglewood began prior to the end of World War II, when roughly one residence in eight was constructed. However, most of the existing residences (78% of the total) were built during the next 35 years. Residential construction tapered off during the 1980s and was substantially complete by 1990.http://censusdocs.edmonton.ca/DD23/FEDERAL%202001/Neighbourhood/INGLEWOOD.pdf According to the 2005 municipal census, the most common type of residence in the neighbourhood is the rented apartment; these constitute seven out of ten (69%) of the residences. Most apartments are in low-rise buildings with fewer than five stories. Single-family dwellings account for only one in four (25%) of all residences. Duplexes account for the remaining 6%.Duplexes include triplexes and quadruplexes. Three out of four (76%) of residences are rented with the remainder being owner occupied.http://censusdocs.edmonton.ca/C05002/MUNICIPAL%202005/Neighbourhood/INGLEWOOD.pdf  Population mobility  The population in Inglewood is highly mobile.

In 1964 the Department of Indian Affairs established the Northern Medical Research Unit under the direction of Otto Schaefer. The Unit was created to address the overwhelming response to a 1959 paper about Arctic health Schaefer published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. The paper was a summary of his medical and personal observations of the changes to Inuit lifestyle with the coming of the DEW Line and increasing southern influence. For the next two decades Schaefer and his staff travelled the Arctic collecting medical information, administering vaccinations to remote camps, and seeing to the general health care of Inuit and First Nations groups in the Arctic. The Unit spent two months a year in the Arctic, as well as occasional emergence trips, and at the Charles Camsell Hospital analysing the data collected and seeing to patients. The conclusions of this research indicated changes to traditional life by increased influence of southern non-Native culture on lifestyle, diet, and social structure had enormous negative health effects. Schaefer became a vocal advocate for a return to traditional lifestyles as a means of countering declining health and better treating medical problems in the Arctic and in hospitals like the Charles Camsell. Between 1945 and 1967, the hospital operated an occupational therapy program for aboriginal patients. In 1990, the hospital donated a collection of over 400 arts and crafts items made by patients in the program to the Royal Alberta Museum.Royal Alberta Museum: Museum Shop: Catalogues A new 385-bed Charles Camsell Hospital was completed in 1966-1967 at 128th street and 114th avenue in Edmonton, Alberta. The hospital was closed and abandoned in 1996, condemned due in part to asbestos. The hospital had been owned by a number of people over the years with development in mind, and some construction and gutting of the floors has taken place, but nothing substantial has been done. No actual development has been finished. The movie \\"White Coats,\\" released in 2004, was filmed in this hospital. In 2006, there was a fire in the building caused by a demolition crew, but firefighters had to fight the fire from the outside of the building since barbed wire had been wrapped around the railings of staircases, in a poor attempt to keep the homeless population out of the building.

However, in 1977 came the first major success for the club, when they achieved the promotion to the Yugoslav First League. In the following 1977‚Äì78 season, the club relegated in the Yugoslav Second League, but managed to achieve the 1977‚Äì78 Yugoslav Cup final, where they lost against NK Rijeka by 0‚Äì1 after extra time.

After the war in 1999, the city was divided into a southern part with almost exclusively Kosovo Albanian and a northern part with non-Albanian or predominantly Serb population. During the war, many Serbs and non-Albanians fled to the northern part of the city or were expelled. Its followed the 2004 unrest in Kosovo, the nationwide pogrom-like riots in March against the Serb and non-Albanian population from Albanian extremist only reinforced the ethnic division of the city.

History In 1955, against the backdrop of despair and pessimism of the Great Depression in Iran, Ali Asghar Karbaschian who known as Allameh founded the Alavi Institute as an Islamic high school in Tehran, the capital of Iran. In 1957 new students entered classes on an old house which was bought for about $15000 and remodeled. The school was accredited by the Ministry of Education, and beside academic subjects, taught Islamic matters. Alavi institution is a branch of National Organization of Exceptional Talents and has gained a strong reputation for its bright students. Mr. Allameh was a scholar in the city of Qom. He said that \\"There is no important job in more than conduct and help human beings to be better and worship God\\"'' He left preaching activities and came to Tehran and established the institute in the name of Imam Ali, the first Imam of the Shi'as. The big milestone after establishing the high school was hiring Ostad Reza Rouzbeh, who was a researcher and teacher, as a Director of the school. Ostad Rouzbeh died in 1973 and after that Dr. Mohammad Reza Khosravi was put in charge.  Admissions  Alavi High school is difficult to gain admission to. About 70-80% of the 9th grade class are students that completed education in Alavi's primary and middle schools. The school's admissions process includes an examination and then an interview. The entrance examination includes Mathematics, Sciences, Persian Literature and History, as well as Shia Islamic fundamentals. The competition is fierce, and out of the hundreds that take the exam about one hundred are invited back for interviews. The interviews examine the student's social and religious core, as well as the parents'. What is looked for is an upper-class or highly educated middle-class family with strong religious convictions. 70-80 students are selected for the 9th grade to form that year's class; these students are then grouped into three classes. The 9th grade class continues to 12th grade and the students are mixed and re- grouped every year; admissions past 9th grade is extremely rare.  Reputation Several students from Alavi high school have been awarded medals at international math and science olympiads such as IMO, IPHO, ICHO, and IBO.  Education  Alavi High School teaches its students three majors which are Math and Physics, Natural Sciences, and Humanities.

Ipswich, 1546), whose Christian name is not known, was a man condemned by the Justices and executed by burning at the stake in Ipswich, Suffolk, for his Protestant beliefs, along with Roger Clarke. He is numbered among the Ipswich Martyrs. He died for denying the Roman Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation of the Host. This was the first recorded execution by burning in Ipswich for such a cause, but was followed by several others over the ensuing twelve years, so that by the death of Queen Mary in 1558 there are said to have been seventy-seven persons in Ipswich under condemnation, who were afterwards released. Ipswich had witnessed the arrest of Thomas Bilney in May 1527 and was the birthplace and childhood home of Thomas Wolsey.  Imprisonment of Messrs. Kerby and Roger  Kerby was one of two men, the other surnamed Roger, who stood accused under the terms of the Act of Six Articles of not accepting the doctrine of transubstantiation. The two were imprisoned in the town gaol which was then located in the West Gate, a mediaeval stone and brick structure which stood on the line of the town ramparts very near to the famous pilgrim chapel of Our Lady of Ipswich. Their gaoler was John Bird, a sympathetic man who had already run close to implication under similar charges, and was much later actually accused by the Commissioners. An important figure instrumental in the accusation against Kerby and Roger was one William Foster, a Justice living at Copdock (a little south of Ipswich), who was later very active in the arrests of the martyrs Rowland Taylor, Robert Samuel, Agnes Potten and Joan Trunchfield.  Visits in prison  During his imprisonment, Kerby was visited by Robert Wingfield, the young heir of Humphrey Wingfield, with Master Breuss of Wenham. Wingfield attempted to dissuade him from his course, saying \\"Remember, the fire is hot; take heed of thine enterprise, that thou take no more upon thee than thou shalt be able to perform. The terror is great, the pain will be extreme; and life is sweet. Better it were betimes to stick to mercy, while there is hope of life, than rashly to begin, and then to shrink.\\" Kerby replied, \\"Oh, Master Wingfield, be at my burning, and you shall say, 'There standeth a Christian soldier in the fire.' For I know that fire and water and sword and all other things are in the hands of God, and he will suffer no more to be laid upon us, than he will give us strength to bear.\\" Wingfield answered, \\"Ah, Kerby! if thou be at that point, I will bid thee farewell, for I promise thee I am not so strong that I am able to burn.\\"  An appeal to justice  The Examination was to take place in the old Town Hall of Ipswich (on the site of the present Town Hall), in the remains of the mediaeval church of St Mildred, beside the Corn Hill. The night before, a bill was nailed to the door by an unknown person, carrying the following words: > Juste judicate filii hominum: Yet, when ye shall judge, minister your > justice with mercy. > A fearful thing it is to fall into the hands of the living God: be ye > learned, therefore, in true knowledge, ye that judge the earth, lest the > Lord be angry with you. > The blood of the righteous shall be required at your hands. What though the > veil hanged before Moses' face, yet at Christ's death it fell down. > The stones will speak if these should hold their peace: Therefore harden > not your hearts against the verity. For fearfully shall the Lord appear in > the day of vengeance to the troubled in conscience. No excuse shall then be > of ignorance. Therefore, have remorse in your conscience; fear Him that may > kill both body and soul. > Beware of innocent blood-shedding; take heed of justice ignorantly > administered; work discreetly as the Scripture doth command; look to it that > ye make not the Truth to be forsaken. > We beseech God to save our King, King Henry the Eighth, that he be not led > into temptation. So be it.  The examination and condemnation  Next morning the bill was discovered and taken to Lord Wentworth, who was to conduct the examination, and he answered that 'the bill was good counsel.' The Justices assembled in the Town Hall, and the prisoners were brought in, who 'made their prayers secretly to God for a space of time' with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven. The articles were read to them, but even the first proved impossible to accept, that 'after the consecration [i.e., of the Host], there is present really the natural body and blood of our Saviour Jesus Christ, conceived of the Virgin Mary, and that after the said consecration there remaineth no substance of bread and wine.' the penalty for non-acceptance was prescribed to be 'death by burning, without any abjuration, benefit of the clergy, or sanctuary.' To this article both Kerby and Roger replied that \\"they did not so believe,\\" and \\"that there was neither flesh nor blood to be eaten with the teeth, but bread and wine; and yet more than bread and wine, for that it is consecrated to a holy use.\\" Lord Wentworth pronounced the sentence of death upon them, at which Kerby held up his hands and, bowing devoutly with humble reverence, he said \\"Praised be Almighty God,\\" and then stood there amid a profound silence. The judge leaned back to whisper a remark to one of his colleagues, whereupon Roger challenged him to say it openly if there was something on his conscience. Lord Wentworth, 'somewhat flushing and changing his countenance', answered \\"I did speak nothing of you, nor have I done anything unto you but as the law is.\\" Kerby was sentenced to be burned in Ipswich on the following Saturday, and Roger at Bury St Edmunds on the Gang Monday following.  The execution  A large crowd (many hundreds) of the public gathered on the Saturday to witness the execution, which was held at the Cornhill (then called the Market Place) outside the Town Hall. Adjacent was the market building called the 'Shambles', a large timbered structure with an arcade around the ground floor, and with a balcony above from which public spectacles could be viewed. A large company, including most of the neighbouring justices, were assembled there, and the stake, broom and brushwood faggots were set up in the centre of the Cornhill. Kerby was fastened to the stake with irons. From the balcony of the Shambles Dr Rugham, formerly a monk of Bury St Edmunds, delivered a sermon, taking his text from Chapter 6 of the Gospel of St John. For there it is written, that in the Synagogue in Capernaum Christ said: > \\"I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any man eat of this > bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, > which I will give for the life of the world.\\" (vs. 51) > \\"Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no > life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal > life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, > and my blood is drink indeed.' (vs. 53-55) As Dr Rugham delivered his sermon, Kerby interrupted with statements to the people telling them here to 'believe him', or there 'it is not true'. The priest then called upon Kerby to declare again his belief concerning the sacrament of the mass, and Kerby replied again as before. The under-Sheriff then asked him if he had anything more to say. \\"Yea, sir, if you will give me leave,\\" replied Kerby. \\"Say on.\\" 'Then Kerby, taking his cap from his head, put it under his arm as though it should have done him service again; but, remembering himself, he cast it from him, and lifting up his arms he said the hymn Te Deum [We praise thee, O God, we acknowledge thee to be the Lord, etc.] and the Belief [i.e. the Credo, I believe in One God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, etc.], with other prayers in the English tongue.' At this Lord Wentworth, who stood in the gallery, was seen to turn aside behind one of the posts of the gallery, and weep, and many of the beholders wept also. The flames were kindled, and with a loud cry to God Kerby beat upon his breast 'so long as his remembrance would serve'; and, in the words of a modern writer, 'in a chariot of fire his soul passes into the unseen world.' As he died a great shout of admiration for his constancy went up from the crowd of witnesses.  Sources  *John Foxe, The Booke of Martyrs *N. F.

It is in the comarca (region) of Alto Palancia.  Geography  The municipality has an area of . It is crossed by the river Palancia, and an area in the south is part of the Calderona mountain range. However, no part of the municipality is in the Sierra Calderona National Park. The town centre is located at a height of , on a rocky promontory along the San Roque Mountain. The population has settled in the opposite direction, staggered along the slope of the hill. =Districts and pedan√≠as= In the municipality of Viver, there are four population centres: * Viver * Mas√≠as de Ragudo * Mas√≠as de Parrela * Mas√≠as del Cristo * Mas√≠as del Rio =Bordering localities= Surrounding Viver are: Teresa, Tor√°s, Barracas, Pina de Montalgrao, Benafer, J√©rica, all localities in the province of Castell√≥n. History There is evidence of human settlements during the paleolithic period in the cave of El Sargal. The first historical data documented for Viver is that the Roman Marco Poncio Cat√≥n founded this locality, with the name of Belsino, in 193 BC. Later, he changed the name to Vivarium, from which the present name was derived. Around 1237‚Äì1239, King Jaime I conquered Viver from the Arabs. On 24 April 1244, the King granted to the population the title of \\"Real Villa\\" (royal estate), and 12 April 1367 the Puebla Letter is granted to him by Juan Alonso, Sire of J√©rica. Later, this villa was given back to the King and finally sold to the Duke of Calabria, Virrey of Valencia, in 1537. The Duke died on 26 October 1550, bequeathing his estate to the monastery of San Miguel of Reyes in Valencia,(which was founded by him), and the monks took possession of Viver. During the Spanish civil war, Viver underwent serious deterioration. In 1945, the Parochial Church was recovered, and many of the houses were reconstructed.  Administration  The current mayor is Patricio G√≥mez G√≥mez of the Socialist Party of Valencian Country, part of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party. He was elected to office in 2011. Viver's Town Hall  Economy  Traditionally, the viverense economy has been based mainly in the primary sector, the agricultural, stressing the vine, but as a result of the scourge of phylloxera in the late 19th century, the almond and olive had become more important. Destacable is the production of olives of high quality. Lately, rural tourism has been growing, through the construction of several farmhouses.  Transport  The simplest access route by road is via the Sagunto to Somport autopista A-23. The town is from Valencia, from Castell√≥n de la Plana, from Sagunto, and 70 km from Teruel. The town can be accessed by rail with a station (J√©rica-Viver) at . The town is on the C-5 del n√∫cleo de cercan√≠as de Valencia Valencia-Caudiel that connects Valencia and Castell√≥n de la Plana.

On 9 October 1787, the patriots were forced to hand in their unit weapons in Amsterdam and Mappa fled like so many others to northern France. With a few friends, like Johan Valckenaer and Herman Willem Daendels he rented an uninhabited castle in Watten.

On 1 December 1789, he arrived with his wife and children to New York and they were granted accommodation with John Adams on Richmond Hill. Mappa became the New York City's very first type-manufacturer (on 22 Greenwich Street, Manhattan) but, even though he could produce Oriental letters, the business was not a success.., In 1794, he took over from Gerrit Boon an appointment as agent of the Holland Land Company in Trenton.

Summary The eponymous heroine is a 1960s anti-war and pro-environmental activist who has in the modern day (1980s --when the novel was written and is partially-set) become part of an illegal underground revolutionary network which resembles the real Weatherman (later known as the Weather Underground). The story is told in the then present-day and in flashbacks to the 1960s. Vida struggles to maintain a double life; still having contacts with legitimate members of society, notably her lover Leigh, while continuing to carry out illegal actions against the government. The novel is notable for describing what everyday-life was like for 60s radical fugitives living \\"underground\\", as Jo Walton writes: > Vida here is realising that the choices she has made have left her > irrelevant not just politically but personally‚Äîher husband is marrying and > having a baby with someone else, she is trapped with the other fugitives she > increasingly dislikes, writing position papers nobody reads. She has false > papers, a false name, she uses codes on the phone with her sister, she > constantly has to appease people who are helping her. It‚Äôs very hard for her > not to feel useless, because in fact she is useless, the revolution she was > waiting for never happened, and she can‚Äôt be with the people she loves. And > the other characters are just as real and well developed, even the minor > characters. Reception John Leonard wrote in the New York Times: > Vida is feisty, she is also emblematic. Marge Piercy, in her sixth novel, > employs Vida to tell us exactly how it was in the lofts of the Left as the > 1960s turned into the 1970s, as the massive peace marches turned into a > tantrum of the cadres. This is the way everybody sounded, as if translated > by thumb from the German and the Russian and the Chinese, at the endless > meetings to establish policy. This is the way everybody behaved, in games of > faction and musical beds. Here are the people who sold out -- to the media, > the academy, the cops and medical school -- and those who persevered, in > their purity and rage. > > There is no reason to doubt that underground life for the radical fugitives > is exactly as Miss Piercy describes it -- with pay phones ringing on > prearranged hours on prearranged days, the switching of subways, the mail > drop and the \\"safe house,\\" the motel room and the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, > the commune in Los Angeles and the A-frame in Vermont... Cynthia Macdonald wrote in the Washington Post: > MARGE PIERCY's strong, complex yet lucid political novel is a flame-opus, > not soap-opera, saved from being the latter by its incandescence...

A travelogue film is an early type of travel documentary, serving as an exploratory ethnographic film. The genre has been represented by television shows such as Across the Seven Seas, which showcased travelogues produced by third parties, and by occasional itinerant presentations of travelogues in theaters and other venues. The British comedian and actor Michael Palin has made several series in this genre beginning with Around the World in 80 Days (1989). PBS has several travel shows including those hosted by Rick Steves and Burt Wolf. History =Travelogues= Travelogues were used to provide the general public with a means of observing different countries and cultures since the late 19th century. Travelogues are considered to be a form of virtual tourism or travel documentary and were often presented as lectures narrating accompanying films and photos. Travelogues are defined as nonfiction films that use a place as their primary subject. They often display the cinematic apparatus and have an open narration. Travelogues were usually about eighty minutes in length, consisting of two 1000-foot reels of 16mm film, with an intermission in- between to change reels. The travelogue film speaker, often but not always the filmmaker, would usually introduce each reel, ask for the lights to be dimmed, and then narrate the film live from an onstage lectern. Travelogue series were usually offered during the winter months and were often sold on subscription basis in small and medium-sized towns. Patrons could then meet the speaker in- person after the show. As cinema progress, the standard film program provided by the most theaters consisted of a feature-length film accompanied by a newsreel and at least one additional short subject, which might take the form of a travelogue, a comedy, a cartoon, or a film about a topical novelty subject matter. Travelogues further developed to incorporate movie rides which were coordinated sounds, motion pictures and mechanical movement to simulate virtual travel. Cin√©orama, which simulates a ride in a hot air balloon and Mareorama, which simulates voyages of the sea, became major attractions at world fairs and expositions. Today's travelogues may be shown with either live or recorded voice-over narration, often with an in-sync audio soundtrack featuring music and location sound. The shows are often performed in school gymnasiums, civic auditoriums, senior center multi-purpose rooms, private clubs, and theatrical venues. Travelogues have been a popular source of fundraising for local, non-profit community-service organizations, such as Kiwanis, Lions Clubs, and Rotary Clubs, among others, with many such clubs hosting travelogue series for decades. Travelogues stem from the work of American writer and lecturer, John Lawson Stoddard who began traveling around the world in 1874. He went on to publish books about his adventures and gave lectures across North America. The original lectures were accompanied by black and white lantern slides printed from his photographs. In 1892, John Lawson Stoddard recruited Burton Holmes as his junior associate. When Stoddard was ready to retire in 1897, he arranged for Holmes to take over the rest of his speaking arrangements. Holmes went on to become the premier travel lecturer of his day and coined the term, \\"travelogues,\\" in 1904 when he introduced film clips to lecture series making them wildly popular. After World War II, Lowell Thomas created popular Movietone News Reel travelogues shown in movie theaters across the U.S. During the 1950s and 1960s, more independent film producers created travelogues, which were shown in towns and schools across the U.S. and Canada. In the 1970s and 1980s, the popularity of traditional travelogues declined but the advent of cable television channels and the availability of small, high quality, digital video equipment has renewed the popularity of travel films. Though travelogues have enjoyed much popularity historically, these films have been criticized for culturally insensitive representations since the films were not made by anthropologists. A famous example is the film about a family in the Canadian Arctic, Nanook of the North, where much of the scenes were staged. =Modern= Travelogues are credited with helping cultivating the interest in the travel industry at the same time transportation infrastructure was being developed to make it possible. As railways and steamships became more accessible, more people became willing and eager to travel to distant places because of what was displayed in the popular travelogues of the day. Today, travelogues are most often seen in IMAX Theaters and play a role in fiction film cinematography. IMAX was invented more than 40 years ago by Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroiter, and Robert Kerr who pioneered the technology and debuted it at the EXPO 67 in Montreal, Canada and later again at EXPO 70 in Osaka, Japan. Since then, IMAX and travelogues have latched onto each other. In the 1970s and 1980s, the popularity of traditional travelogues declined. But the advent of cable television channels, such as the Discovery Channel and the Travel Channel and the availability of small, high quality, digital video equipment has renewed the popularity of travel films. Amateur films of an individual's travels can be considered travelogues as well. The Flavor of Kolkata (2015), a short travel documentary shot in the Indian city Kolkata, was India's first 3D short travel documentary. Content Travel documentary is a kind of documentary. Travel documentaries generally tell stories about travel or introduce travel destinations. In general, there will be a leading figure in the documentary. This figure will lead the audience to play and introduce the audience to the local cultural landscape, food and customs. From these documentaries, viewers can understand where these places are worth playing and eating. Therefore, travel documentaries can also be described as human geography documentaries. They can lead the audience to better understand a place  Shooting techniques and targeting audiences  It takes a lot of energy to shoot a travel documentary. There are many things to worry about. The production process of travel documentaries is very complicated. First, the director needs to place a large number of staff and allocate all the equipment. In addition, they have to be responsible for formulating travel plans. They also need to book hotels and foods in advance. And they may have to prepare for many unexpected situations. The documentary filming method is different from many other films. In the process of documentary filming, it is often necessary to interview other people. So the quality of the interview is very important for the documentary. The details of the documentary are also very important. Take tourism documentaries as an example. Only by making every appealing place in the tourist destination clear, can we attract more people to travel there. There are also some questions about the shooting angle. Because documentaries have a higher requirement for authenticity, they must have the most reasonable shooting angle. In the opinion of director Lydia B. Smith, the most valuable part of the travel documentary encourages people to walk out of the comfort zone and into the world, to experience a variety of different cultures and to further enhance themselves. He also believes that his people should understand how people in other countries think of their own country. This is the significance of travel documentary. How can such a complicated and tedious process be always interested in shooting travel documentaries? Smith gave his own answer: ‚ÄúOnly do it if you are 100% passionate about your subject matter and that it will fuel you as well during the process.\\" Key figures * Burton Holmes was an American traveler, photographer and filmmaker, who coined the term \\"travelogue\\". Each summer for over fifty years Holmes would travel the world and then tour American auditoriums in the winter; during the 1945-46 season alone he gave 157 two-hour lectures. By the end of his life, Holmes's had given over 8000 travelogue lectures which were known to draw large audiences in cities like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.

KLSW is owned and operated by Educational Media Foundation. History KMCQ, who signed on the air on November 28, 1968 as KCIV-FM and changed call letters to KMCQ on June 20, 1984, has been serving The Dalles/Hood River, Oregon area since its sign on, as a beautiful music station under the KCIV-FM calls, then mostly as a Hot AC under the KMCQ calls until March 30, 2007. In 2005, a realignment of FM frequencies in the Pacific Northwest area resulted in several stations moving to new locations. KMCQ would end up being one of the stations relocating in the shuffle as the 104.5 signal changed its city of license to Covington, Washington, a suburb of Seattle in southwest King County. As a result of this move, KMIH, a class-D FM station licensed to Mercer Island, Washington, vacated the 104.5 signal to make room for KMCQ and moved to 88.9 after the changes were made. Already another station at this same frequency, KCFL-LP, has since relocated to Ocean Shores, Washington at 89.5. KMCQ was testing its signal and allowed KMIH to remain at their current frequency, but requested that they sign-off their 104.5 transmission occasionally at night in order to do the testing. The testing was done most of time with programing provided by KMIH, possibly to lower the number of listener complaints. At the same time there were several issues holding up the move-in as they also waited on KAFE/Bellingham, Washington's planned move from 104.3 to 104.1 which was delayed by the coordination process with Canada as the stations are all in the Canadian border zone. In addition, CHHR 104.1 Vancouver was approved as a new station in 2008 by the CRTC. In February 2009, CHHR-FM applied to the CRTC to move from 104.1 to 104.3, allowing KAFE to move to 104.1 and allowing KMCQ to move to Cougar Mountain; CHHR themselves would begin broadcast on July 1, 2009 at 104.1. On August 27, 2008, it was announced that KMIH and KMCQ finalized their frequency swap. The move now paved the way for KMCQ to finally target the Puget Sound area. KMCQ also announced that on August 31, 2008, that they will flip from adult contemporary to oldies, filling the void left open by KBSG, who dropped the format for news/talk as KIRO-FM two weeks earlier.Mercer Island school station gets new home From Seattle Post-Intelligencer (August 27, 2008) The frequency swap between CHHR-FM and KAFE was granted on March 31, 2009;Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-168 the two stations swapped frequencies on January 14, 2010 at 7:30 AM,Press Release KAFE-FM to move to dial position 104.1 thus allowing KMCQ to increase its effective radiated power and become a full-fledged Seattle radio station with wider coverage, beginning February 8, 2010.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/1571/104-5-kmcq-seattle-officially- launches/ Following the flip of KVI to talk in January 2012, KMCQ became the market's only oldies station, with rival KJR-FM being a classic hits station that focuses on 1970s and early 1980s.

(1977) Patriots and liberators. Revolution in the Netherlands, 1780-1813, p. 74, 168, 651. (First American edition, New York). Having been a promising student in Groningen, Franeker and Amsterdam, he led the local militia (exercitiegenootschap) in Wijk bij Duurstede and ended up in captivity. Van der Kemp was released on 9 December 1787 for a ransom of 45,000 guilder and emigrated to the U.S.A.Rosendaal, J.G.M.M., De Nederlandse Revolutie. Vrijheid, volk en vaderland 1783-1799 (Nijmegen 2005), p. 62-64. Life Adriaan was the son of an army officer, his mother was related to Willem Jacob 's Gravesande, a scientist. He grew up in Zutphen and Zwolle, but in 1766 the family moved to 's-Hertogenbosch. Adriaan studied at the local grammar school and moved to the University of Groningen to study Oriental languages and botany under Petrus Camper. Van der Kemp was offered a role as a civil servant in Elmina, now in Ghana, but did not go. Instead he went over to the Mennonites and studied theology in Amsterdam with Abraham Staal and Wybo Fijnje. Van der Kemp refused an appointment in Goes and Makkum, but accepted one at Westzaan.Kemp, Francis Adrian van der (1903) An Autobiography, with an historical sketch by Helen C. Fairchild, New York, p. . In 1775 he moved to Leiden. From the pulpit Van der Kemp proclaimed: \\"In America the Sun of Salvation has risen, which will also cast its rays upon us if we so wish: only America can teach us how to counter the degeneration of the national character, to curb the corruption of morals, to ward off bribery, to suffocate the seeds of tyranny and to restore to health our dying freedom.

It is said Van der Kemp was the author or ghostwriter of the \\"libel\\" \\"To the People of the Netherlands\\".Hulzen, A. van (1966) Utrecht in de patriottentijd, p. 160. Simon Schama notes he was the distributor of the pamphlet.Schama, S. (1977) Patriots and liberators. Revolution in the Netherlands, 1780-1813, p. 64. (4th edition, Amsterdam 2005). Van der Kemp wrote a series of anti-bailiff or droste pamphlets for Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol under different pseudonyms.Landdrost was a leftover from the medieval feudal system, to which farmers in Overijssel were subjected right up to the end of the Dutch Republic. Van der Kemp and van der Capellen argued that these feudal rights were arbitrarily applied and even unlawful, thus bringing them into conflict with the drosten and the Prince of Orange, who derived the rights of his noble position from such things. In 1782, he married Reinira Engelbartha Johanna Vos, a daughter of a mayor of Nijmegen. They were the parents of three children: John Jacob Vanderkemp (1783-1855), Cuneira Englebertha Vanderkemp (1785‚Äì1865) and Peter A. A. T. Vanderkemp (1789‚Äì1857). In 1783 Van der Kemp moved to Wijk bij Duurstede and became the leader of the local patriots.Hulzen, A. van (1966) Utrecht in de patriottentijd, p. 188. The arrest of Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia at the end of June 1787 demanded a response, and so Van der Kemp and Adriaan de Nijs were taken prisoner on 5 July, near Wijk bij Duurstede by a regiment of soldiers from Baden-Durlach and taken to Amersfoort.Hulzen, A. van (1966) Utrecht in de patriottentijd, p. 283. After his release he emigrated to America. In his baggage was a portrait of Van der Capellen. Van der Kemp published Van der Capellen's collected works in six parts and also contained, next to all Van der Capellen's reasonings, official documents that had not been intended for actual publication. =Van der Kemp as immigrant= In 1788 Van der Kemp arrived in New York. He bought a farm in Ulster County, New York in 1789, not far from Kingston and from 1777 the capital of New York. He had a house, a shed, a chicken coop, and a few slaves\\".Kemp, Francis Adrian van der (1903) An Autobiography, with an historical sketch by Helen C. Fairchild, New York In 1795, he was the founder of the Agricultural Society for the Western District of New York. Van der Kemp was linked to and visited in Kempwick by various Founding Fathers: John Adams, with whom he had an extensive and fascinating correspondence, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton. Mrs DeWitt Clinton, Hamilton and Tappan were all able to speak Dutch with his wife.L. Ligtenberg (1999) De nieuwe wereld van Peter Stuyvesant. Nederlandse voetsporen in de Verenigde Staten. p. 77. He shared George Washington's interest in scientific agriculture after a visit to Mount Vernon. Van der Kemp withdrew from political life and threw himself into a new project at 'Nieuw Rotterdam', now called Constantia, in Oswego County. Constantia had a fantastic location and a fine nature, and there was sufficient game for hunting and fish in the lake. Also Marc Isambard Brunel lived in the neighborhood. However, the bears and Native Americans were never far away, and his friend Adam Gerard Mappa lived at a day's travel away. Van der Kemp moved his family to Barneveld, now called Trenton. His house in Constantia was converted into a school. The Holland Land Company, that had taken into its service Gerrit Boon from Rotterdam, had meanwhile set up a proper village, planted ahorns and had a sugar mill built. On the national scene, Van der Kemp's opinions influenced many of the great leaders of America. John Adams credited him with a \\"vast view of civilization\\" and respected his advice. His warm friendship with John and Abigail Adams endured till their deaths, and John Quincy Adams continued the relationship.Jackson, Harry F., (1963) Scholar in the Wilderness: Francis Adrian Van der Kemp He persuaded Thomas Jefferson to anonymously publish his religious work a \\"Syllabus of an estimate of the doctrines of Jesus compared with those of others\\".Misbach, Matthew A., (2007) The Van der Kemp Collection: A bundle of Thomas Jefferson's Letters: He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1807.

He published 138 scientific papers, most of them dealing with his specialist field, the myriapods. He described about 1800 new species and subspecies from all over the world. Life Attems was born in 1868 in Graz, to the aristocratic family of Attems. He attended school in Graz, then he followed his family's wish and studied law and law history. After finishing his studies in 1891 he went to Bonn and dedicated himself to his main interest: zoology. He started his zoology studies in Germany, later moved to Vienna. Attems completed his degree with the dissertation \\"Die Copulationsf√º√üe der Polydesmiden\\". During his further studies he spent a lot of time examining the myriapod collection of the Viennese Hofmuseum (today's Naturhistorisches Museum). In 1898 he visited the zoological station at Naples and one year later he went to Crete. The resulting publication was named \\"Myriopoden von Kreta, nebst Beitr√§gen zur allgemeinen Kenntnis einiger Gattungen.\\" (Myriopods of Crete, with contributions to common knowledge of some species.) In 1905 he became an assistant in the Crustacea, Arachnoidea, and Myriapoda collection of the museum. On several excursions to Macedonia, Slovenia, and Croatia he collected myriapods, which he afterwards examined in addition to other collections from all over the world. In between Attems was appointed curator of the Evertebrata-Varia collection and spent the summer of 1911 in Roscoff, France, studying polychaetes. In the same year he married Emma von Montbach. Befriended scientist Karl Wilhelm Verhoeff dedicated him several genus (Attemsia Verh., Attemsocyphus Verh., Attemsodesmus R. F. Lawrence). During World War I he was called up for military service. Due to the economic crisis during the late 1920s he had to retire from any bureaucratic activity and focussed exclusively on his myriapod studies. Every day he visited the museum's collection. On 19 April 1952 Attems died on his usual way to the museum. Major works Attems was regarded for synthesizing and generalizing existing knowledge, and making it accessible to future generations. The myriapodologist Richard L. Hoffman, writing nearly 50 years after Attems' death, recognized this skill in Attems' major monographs, most prominently in three volumes on the Polydesmidea published from 1937 to 1940, \\"the capstone of an illustrious lifetime of accomplishment\\".

It was formerly made illegally and is thus similar to moonshine. It is most typical of the Mekong Delta region of southwestern Vietnam (its equivalent in northern Vietnam is called r∆∞·ª£u qu·ªëc l·ªßi). Its strength varies, but is typically 40 percent alcohol by volume. It is usually clear, and a bit cloudy in appearance. Etymology The term r∆∞·ª£u ƒë·∫ø literally means \\"ƒë·∫ø (Kans grass) liquor.\\" This name is explained by the fact that in Cochinchina (southern Vietnam) during the early period of French colonization, the imperialist government had a monopoly on alcohol production, and the only distilled alcoholic beverage the general population could legally purchase was r∆∞·ª£u C√¥ng Ty (literally \\"Company alcohol\\"; also known as r∆∞·ª£u Ty). Those who paid a special fee were given a sign emblazoned with the letters \\"RA\\" (an abbreviation for \\"R√©gie d'Alcool\\") to hang in front of their store, which gave them the privilege to be able to sell alcohol from the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise des Distilleries de l'Indochine, which was a diluted distilled alcoholic beverage made from rice and corn. In order to obtain liquor with a higher proof, many people resorted to distilling their own liquor in secret by hiding it in tall grass called c·ªè tranh (Imperata cylindrica), or in another kind of grass called ƒë·∫ø (Kans grass, which grows up to three meters tall), far away from their homes. Whenever such individuals saw the tax collector, they would bring their alcohol and hide it in a field overgrown with ƒë·∫ø plants. R∆∞·ª£u ƒë·∫ø is sometimes referred to as r∆∞·ª£u l·∫≠u, literally \\"contraband liquor\\", although this term may also refer to other varieties of illegally produced Vietnamese liquor or rice wine. While the term r∆∞·ª£u ƒë·∫ø is used most often in southern Vietnam, such liquor is typically called r∆∞·ª£u qu·ªëc l·ªßi in northern Vietnam. Although the exact etymology of the latter term is unclear, its component words translate literally as follows: r∆∞·ª£u=liquor; qu·ªëc=nation, state; and l·ªßi=to slip away. There are several theories of the origin of this term. The first proposes that it is a corruption of r∆∞·ª£u cu·ªëc l·ªßi (literally \\"swamphen slips away liquor\\"), as cu·ªëc (Porphyrio, a type of swamphen) and qu·ªëc are homophones; this term may have come about because those who produce and sell this form of liquor have to do it in fear of prosecution, selling and then slipping away, like the behavior of the cu·ªëc bird. The second theory is that the term is a parody of the foreign term \\"national spirit\\" (literally translated as qu·ªëc h·ªìn qu·ªëc t√∫y, but can be understood to refer to a type of liquor), because the \\"national spirit\\" has to be produced surreptitiously, it is thus called r∆∞·ª£u qu·ªëc l·ªßi. The third theory states that the term was created to distinguish this liquor from r∆∞·ª£u qu·ªëc doanh (literally \\"state enterprise alcohol\\"); the government in northern Vietnam under communist rule prior to ƒë·ªïi m·ªõi in the 1980s had a monopoly on liquor production, so this illegally produced alcohol is similar to American moonshine‚Äîagain highlighting the theme of secrecy.

Having taken Borazjan without a fight, the British expeditionary army under Sir James Outram was in the process of withdrawing to Bushehr when it was ambushed by a far larger Persian force under Khanlar Mirza, drawn up in battle order to its rear. The distinguishing action of the battle was the charge of the 3rd Bombay Light Cavalry (now amalgamated into The Poona Horse) against an infantry square of the 1st Khusgai Regiment of Fars, in which two Victoria Crosses were won. The recipients were the commander's adjutant Lieutenant Arthur Thomas Moore, who first broke into the square, and Captain John Grant Malcolmson, who then extricated Moore. Only twenty of the five hundred soldiers in the square escaped. Having beaten off the ambush, the British continued their withdrawal to Bushehr.

Details It has been described as a clearinghouse for requests by law enforcement, border security, and other domestic homeland security agencies to access feeds from spy satellites that have collected data for mainly scientific and military uses in the past. The name of the agency has been described as \\"deceptive.\\"Politico, June 12, 2009, http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23664.html Access to spy satellite surveillance tools allows Homeland Security and law enforcement officials to see real-time, high-quality images. This allows them to identify gang safehouses, border smuggler staging areas, or even hideouts of would-be terrorists. The spy surveillance satellites are considered by military experts to be far more powerful than those currently available to civilian officials. For example, they can take color photos, see through cloud cover and forest canopies, and use different parts of the light spectrum to locate traces left by chemical weapons. However, the full capabilities of these systems are among the most carefully held governmental secrets. As of October 2, 2007, the United States Congress has filed an injunction against the NAO, that orders it not to begin operations. This is due largely to questions about civil liberty issues. Some in Congress wanted to shut down the agency because of concerns that the satellites could be used to create a \\"Big Brother\\" in the sky directed willy-nilly at anyone's house, place of worship or school.Politico, June 12, 2009, http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/23664.html The NAO's charter was signed in February 2008. On November 9, 2008 the Government Accountability Office released a recommendation that the NAO's role be more strictly defined. This might be seen as evidence that the aforementioned civil liberty issues have not been sufficiently addressed.

The early Restoration period (1660‚Äì77) This list includes several earlier ships which were rebuilt for the Royal Navy in this period‚Äîspecifically the first-rate Prince Royal (in 1663), the second-rate Victory (in 1666), the third-rate Montague (in 1675) and the fourth-rates Bonaventure (in 1663) and Constant Warwick (in 1666). The process, which generally involved the dismantling in dry dock of the old ship and constructing it to a new design incorporating part of the materials from the old vessel, produced what were in effect substantially new ships with altered dimensions and sizes, and generally mounting a somewhat larger number of guns. =First rates= * Prince Royal 92 (rebuilt 1663) ‚Äì taken and burnt by the Dutch 1666 * Charles 96 (1668) ‚Äì renamed St George 1687, re-classed as second rate 1691, rebuilt 1701 * St Andrew 96 (1670) ‚Äì renamed Royal Anne when rebuilt 1704 * London 96 (1670) ‚Äì broken up 1701 * Prince 100 (1670) ‚Äì repaired and renamed Royal William 1692, rebuilt 1719 * Royal James 100 (1671) ‚Äì burned in action 1672 * Royal Charles 100 (1673) ‚Äì repaired and renamed Queen 1693, rebuilt and renamed Royal George in 1715 * Royal James 100 (1675) ‚Äì renamed Victory 1691, then Royal George 1714, then Victory again in 1715; burnt by accident 1721 =Second rates= * Royal Katherine 76 (1664) ‚Äì rebuilt from 1699 to 1703 * Royal Oak 76 (1664) ‚Äì burned by the Dutch on 14 June 1667 * Loyal London 80 (1666) ‚Äì burned by the Dutch on 14 June 1667 * Victory 76 (Rebuilt 1666) ‚Äì condemned and broken up 1691 * French Ruby 66 (1666) ‚Äì a prize, Le Rubis, captured from the French, hulked January 1686 at Portsmouth after storm damage and broken up * St Michael 90 (1669) ‚Äì re- classed as a first rate 1672, then back to a second rate 1689; renamed Marlborough in 1706 and rebuilt 1706 to 1708 =Third rates= * Clove Tree 62 (1665) ‚Äì a prize, formerly VOC ship Nagelboom, captured from the Dutch, retaken by them 1666 * House of Sweeds 70 (1665) ‚Äì formerly Huis te Zwieten, a prize captured from the Dutch, sunk as a blockship in the Thames 1667 * Golden Phoenix 70 (1665) ‚Äì formerly Geldersche Ruyter, a prize captured from the Dutch, sunk as a blockship in the Thames 1667 * Slothany 60 (1665) ‚Äì formerly Slot Hooningen, a prize captured from the Dutch, hulked 1667, sold 1686 * Helverson 60 (1665) ‚Äì formerly Hilversum, a prize captured from the Dutch in June 1665, sunk as a blockship in the Medway 1667 * Cambridge 64 (1666) ‚Äì wrecked 1694 * Warspite 64 (1666) ‚Äì rebuilt 1702 * Defiance 64 (1666) ‚Äì burned by accident 1668 * Rupert 64 (1666) ‚Äì rebuilt 1703 * Resolution 64 (1667) ‚Äì rebuilt 1698 * Monmouth 64 (1667) ‚Äì rebuilt 1700 * Edgar 72 (1668) ‚Äì rebuilt 1700 * Swiftsure 66 (1673) ‚Äì rebuilt 1696 * Harwich 66 (1674) ‚Äì wrecked 1691 * Royal Oak 70 (1674) ‚Äì rebuilt 1713 * Defiance 64 (1675) ‚Äì rebuilt 1695 * Arms of Rotterdam 60 (1674) ‚Äì a prize captured from the Dutch, hulked 1675, broken up 1703 * Montague 62 ‚Äì built as Lyme in 1654, rebuilt as Montague in 1675 and again rebuilt in 1698 =Fourth rates= * Bonaventure 48 ‚Äì previously named HMS President.

List of ships-of-the-line of the Royal Navy (1755‚Äì85) By or soon after the appointment of Baron George Anson as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1751, the system of establishments that covered the design of British warships was abandoned, and with the appointment of Thomas Slade and William Bately as joint holders of the post of Surveyor of the Navy in 1755, new principles governed the composition of the battle fleet. The Navy Board stopped building any further three-decker 80-gun ships. Production of the 70-gun and 60-gun ships also ceased. Instead, new 74-gun and 64-gun ships replaced these classes. Although 50-gun and 44-gun two-deckers continued to be built for cruising duties, the Navy no longer considered the 50-gun ships powerful enough to serve as ships of the line. :Number of main guns follows name (see rating system of the Royal Navy) =First rate of 100 guns (three-deckers)= * Victory class (Slade) ** Victory 100 (1765) ‚Äì \\"great repair\\" 1801‚Äì03, flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar 1805, 1805‚Äì08 modernised and re-rated as 98-gun second rate, hulked at Portsmouth 1824, dry-docked 1922, converted during the 1920s to her 1805 appearance, preserved in commission at Portsmouth as the only remaining ship of the linepp. 62‚Äì63 Lyon The Sailing Navy List, p. 175 Lavery The Ship of the Line Volume I, HMS Victory.com * Royal Sovereign class (Williams) ** Royal Sovereign 100 (1786) ‚Äì broken up 1841 * Umpire class (Hunt) ** Royal George 100 (1788) ‚Äì broken up 1822 ** Queen Charlotte 100 (1790) ‚Äì an accidental fire in 1800 destroyed her and killed 673 of her crew of 859 ** Queen Charlotte 104 (1810) ‚Äì renamed Excellent 1860, broken up 1892 =Second rates of 90 guns [later 98 guns] (three-deckers)= * Sandwich class (Slade) ** Sandwich 90 (1759) ‚Äì floating battery 1780, harbour service 1790, broken up 1810 ** Blenheim 90 (1761) ‚Äì reduced to 74 in 1800; foundered, presumably off Madagascar, with all hands 1807 ** Ocean 90 (1761) ‚Äì Modified version of the Sandwich class, sold 1793 * London class (Slade) ** London 90 (1766) ‚Äì broken up 1811 * Barfleur class (Slade, based on Royal William) ** Barfleur 90 (1768) ‚Äì broken up 1819p. 64 Lyon The Sailing Navy List The date of breaking up quoted in Lavery is wrong. p. 175 Lavery The Ship of the Line Volume I, HMS Victory.com ** Prince George 90 (1772) ‚Äì broken up 1839 ** Princess Royal 90 (1773) ‚Äì broken up 1807 ** Formidable 90/98 (1777) ‚Äì broken up 1813 * Queen class (Bately) ** Queen 90 (1769) ‚Äì reduced to 74 in 1811, broken up 1821 * Duke class (Williams) ** Duke 98 (1777) ‚Äì broken up 1843 ** St George 98 (1785) ‚Äì wrecked 1811 off the coast of Jutland with the loss of almost her entire crew ** Glory 98 (1788) ‚Äì broken up 1825 ** Atlas 98 (1782) ‚Äì broken up 1821 * Revived London class (Slade) ** Prince 98 (1788) ‚Äì lengthened by 17 ft in 1796, broken up 1837 ** Impregnable 98 (1786) ‚Äì wrecked 1799, with no loss of life, on the Chichester Shoals ** Windsor Castle 98 (1790) ‚Äì razeed to 74-gun-ship 1814, broken up 1839 * Boyne class (Hunt) ** Boyne 98 (1790) ‚Äì caught fire by accident and blew up at Spithead 1795 ** Prince of Wales 98 (1794) ‚Äì broken up 1822. =Third rates of 80 guns (two- deckers)= * Caesar' class (Hunt) ** Caesar 80 (1793) ‚Äì 1814 hulked ‚Äì used as army depot at Portsmouth, broken up 1821 =Third rates of 74 guns (two- deckers)= * Dublin class (Slade) ** Dublin 74 (1757) ‚Äì the first British \\"74\\".

Captain Symonds was a naval officer and yacht designer, \\"who had risen to prominence by his success in competitive sailing trials between small warships. His selection implied a criticism of the dockyard-trained architects of the preceding 200 years\\".p15, Lambert Battleships in Transition Symonds attempted a revolution in warship design. His ships were designed to be faster under sail, and have more room for the gunners to work the guns (improving ergonomics). To achieve this, his ships were larger, and used a different hull form to provide stability without needing large amounts of ballast. Unfortunately the Surveyor's department was understaffed for the amount of work they were undertaking, and mistakes were made. Symonds' designs had more stability than was desirable, with the result that they rolled excessively and therefore were poor gun platforms. Another problem with Symonds' ships was that they were very sensitive to the distribution of weights on board ship, such as the stores carried and consumed on a voyage.p66-87, Lambert The Last Sailing Battlefleet Symonds worked very closely with John Edye, an experienced and well-educated shipwright officer. Edye was responsible for the details of structure and construction. The ships that Symonds and Edye designed had far more iron in their structure than the previous generation of ships designed by Seppings. =First rates of 120 guns (three-deckers)= * Royal Albert class (Lang) 3-decker, 120 guns ** Royal Albert 120 (1854) ‚Äì laid down 1844, converted to screw 1852‚Äì54 p. 170, Lyon, The Sailing Navy Listp128, Lambert, Battleships in Transition * Duke of Wellington class (Surveyors Department) improved Queen, 3-deckers, 120 guns ** Windsor Castle 120 (1852) ‚Äì laid down 1849, converted to screw 131-guns 1852, renamed Duke of Wellington pp. 127‚Äì28, Lambert, Battleships in Transition ** Marlborough 120 (1855) ‚Äì laid down 1850, converted to screw 131-guns 1853‚Äì55 ** Royal Sovereign 120 (1857) ‚Äì laid down 1849, converted to screw 1855‚Äì57 ** Prince of Wales 120 (1860) ‚Äì laid down 1848, converted to screw 1856‚Äì60 =First rates of 110 guns (three- deckers)= * Queen class (Symonds & Edye) 3-decker 110 guns ** Queen 116 (1839) ‚Äì ex-Royal Frederick, laid down 1833, converted to screw 2-decker 1858‚Äì59 p135-6, Lambert Battleships in Transition ** Victoria 116 (1858) ‚Äì laid down 1844, renamed Windsor Castle 1855, converted to screw 1857‚Äì58 p129, Lambert Battleships in Transition ** Frederick William 116 (1860) ‚Äì ex-Royal Frederick, laid down 1841, converted to screw 2-decker 1859‚Äì60 ** Algiers ‚Äì ordered 1833, but not begun, cancelled 11 December 1834.p171, Lyon, The Sailing Navy List ** Royal Sovereign ‚Äì ordered 1832, probably not begun, cancelled 1838. =Second rates of 90 guns (two-deckers)= * Albion class (Symonds & Edye) ** Albion 90 (1842) ‚Äì laid down 1839.

Sites of Memory ‚Äì Suitcase 2006 screenprint Biography Born in Marylebone, London, he studied fine art at the West of England College of Art from 1972 to 1975 and then studied printmaking at postgraduate level at the Slade school of art 1975‚Äì77, where his teachers included Barto. Dos Santos and Stanley Jones. He was employed as research assistant at the Slade from 1978 to 1981. He was appointed Subject Leader MA Printmaking at Camberwell College of Arts in 1997 and 1998 took over as project leader for a research project The Integration of Computers within Fine art practice developing his interest in the use of digital technology within Printmaking. He curated Computers & Printmaking with Tessa Sidey, for Birmingham Museums and Art Gallery 1999 and has further developed these concerns through an AHRC funded project The Personalised Surface within Fine Art Digital Printmaking. In 2001 he was appointed professor at The London Institute (now The University of the Arts London).http://www.icfar.co.uk/artists/paulcoldwell?sort His curatorial practice includes Digital Responses for the V&A; 2002‚Äì03 and Morandi's Legacy; Influences on British Art for the Estorick Collection London and Abbot Hall Cumbria 2006, which explored his long-term interest in this Italian artist. His interest in working with collections and other artists is further evidenced in the installation of his work in the house, Kettle's Yard, Cambridge, 2008 entitled \\"I called while you were out\\". In addition to his teaching and studio practice, he worked with Paula Rego on all her etchings between 1985 and 2005, including the Nursery Rhymes and Peter Pan. He wrote the catalogue Paula Rego Printmaker 2005 to accompany her travelling print retrospective and authored a chapter on her printmaking technique in Paula Rego-The complete Graphic work, TG Rosenthal, Thames & Hudson. His book Printmaking: A Contemporary Perspective provides a broad overview of the history of printmaking with a focus on contemporary approaches to both new and old print technologies. Coldwell's practice embraces printmaking, bookworks and sculpture. He has exhibited widely, solo exhibitions include Kafka's Doll & other works, Eagle Gallery London 2007, Case Studies, London Print Studio and Queens Gallery, New Delhi, By this I mean‚Ä¶ Arthouse Dublin,1999 and Freud's Coat, Freud Museum London 1996.

Affecting all the major stock markets in the world, particularly the United Kingdom, it was one of the worst stock market downturns since the Great Depression, the other being the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The crash came after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system over the previous two years, with the associated 'Nixon Shock' and United States dollar devaluation under the Smithsonian Agreement. It was compounded by the outbreak of the 1973 oil crisis in October of that year. It was a major event of the 1970s recession. History In the 694 days between 11 January 1973 and 6 December 1974, the New York Stock Exchange's Dow Jones Industrial Average benchmark suffered the seventh-worst bear market in its history, losing over 45% of its value. 1972 had been a good year for the DJIA, with gains of 15% in the twelve months. 1973 had been expected to be even better, with Time magazine reporting just 3 days before the crash began that it was 'shaping up as a gilt-edged year'. In the two years from 1972 to 1974, the American economy slowed from 7.2% real GDP growth to ‚àí2.1% contraction, while inflation (by CPI) jumped from 3.4% in 1972 to 12.3% in 1974. The effect was worse in the United Kingdom, particularly on the London Stock Exchange's FT 30, which lost 73% of its value during the crash. From a rate of 5.1% real GDP growth in 1972, the UK went into recession in 1974, with GDP falling by 1.1%. At the time, the UK's property market was going through a major crisis, and a secondary banking crisis forced the Bank of England to bail out a number of lenders. In the United Kingdom, the crash ended after the rent freeze was lifted on 19 December 1974, allowing a readjustment of property prices; over the following year, stock prices rose by 150%. The definitive market low for the FT30 Index (a forerunner of the FTSE100 today) came on 6 January 1975, when the index closed at 146 (having reached a nadir of 145.8 intra-day). The market then practically doubled in just over 3 months. However, unlike in the United States, inflation continued to rise, to 25% in 1975, giving way to the era of stagflation. The Hong Kong Hang Seng Index also fell from 1,800 in early 1973 to close to 300.Cairncross, Frances. McRae, Hamish. [1975] (1975) The Second great crash.

In all cases, the recovery was a slow process. Although West Germany's market was the fastest to recover, returning to the original nominal level within eighteen months, it did not return to the same real level until June 1985. The United Kingdom didn't return to the same market level until May 1987 (only a few months before the Black Monday crash), whilst the United States didn't see the same level in real terms until August 1993, over twenty years after the 1973‚Äì74 crash began.

It is considered a problematic invasive species due to its use in home aquariums and subsequent release into non- native habitats.  Description  Egeria densa flower Egeria densa is an aquatic plant growing in water up to deep, with trailing stems to or more long, producing roots at intervals along the stem. The leaves are produced in whorls of four to eight, long and broad, with a pointed leaf tip. The stem system of the plant will grow until it reaches the surface of the water, where it will begin to spread out, creating a thick flower canopy that blocks light from reaching plants below it. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants; the flowers are diameter, with three broad, rounded, white petals, long on male plants, and long on female plants.Flora of NW Europe: Egeria densaFlora North America: Egeria densaJepson Flora: Egeria densaWashington Department of Ecology: Egeria densa = Life cycle = Egeria densa typically displays little variation in growth patterns throughout the year when grown in tropical environments; however, when grown in more moderate environments the plant spends most of its energy on starch production and storage in the winter and canopy growth during the summer season = Habitat and ecology =  Location  Egeria densa is native to Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay. As a result of its popularity in aquariums the plant has now spread to North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.  Temperature  Temperature is important to the growth of Egeria densa; however, its growth is mostly stable in temperatures ranging from , with an upper temperature limit of that results in reduced shoot growth and photosynthetic output. Colder temperatures will limit growth of the plant and can be used as a method of controlling its spread in non-native habitats.  Lighting  Egeria densa is able to match photosynthetic output to available light like many macrophyte species. The species' ability to thrive in low light conditions and its ability to form a dense canopy makes it a very successful invader compared with other macrophytes, resulting in a reduction in the diversity of plant species where it is introduced.  Cultivation and uses  Egeria densa is a popular aquarium plant, but is no longer sold in some areas due to its invasive potential. Plants in cultivation are all a male clone, reproducing vegetatively. It grows well in the cooler aquarium and is suitable for the beginner. It is easily propagated by cuttings. According to reports it secretes antibiotic substances which can help prevent blue-green algae. It grows best in a nutrient-rich, high light environment, but has shown an ability to outcompete other species when it is introduced. = Economics = E. densa, like other macrophytes, are effective when used in wastewater treatment plants due to the same factors that make it a potential invasive plant; mainly its ability to uptake nutrients, and sedimentation of particles from the water column. = Invasive species = Egeria densa has escaped from cultivation and become naturalized and invasive in many warm temperate to subtropical regions of the world, including Europe, southern Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia and North America. In the United States it occurs from New York south to Florida and west to California and Oregon. In the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, it was introduced in the 1960s and has since had a significant adverse impact on the local ecosystem. The plant currently infests , or 12% of the total surface area of the delta, along with other states and even as far north as Canada. Recently, E. densa was reported as naturalized alien species in Iceland where it invaded the naturally heated water bodies. Due to its occurrence in northern Iceland, E. densa is one of the first freshwater alien plant species that reached the Arctic. Most of its impact occurs in the shallow waterways; the plant forms thick mats that obstruct boat passage, clog water intakes and aqueducts, trap sediments, crowd out native vegetation, and impede the migration of anadromous fish.Foschi, P. G., Fields, G., & Liu, H. (undated). Detecting a Spectrally Variable Subject in Color Infrared Imagery Using Data-Mining and Knowledge- Engine Methods. PRRS04-018. Available online (pdf file)California Department of Boating and Waterways: Aquatic Pest Control  Role as ecosystem engineer  Though it is sometimes debated, E. densa is referred to as an ecosystem engineer as a result of the impact it has on a habitat once it is introduced. Some of these impacts are due to its fast growth and high dispersal rate when fragmented, its ability to adapt to different light and nutrient availability, its uptake of nutrients from the water column and its effect on sedimentation of these nutrients, and the large light-blocking canopy that its flowers form at the surface of the water. Egeria densa is also responsible for changing the amount of phytoplankton present in the water column due to limiting light availability from the dense canopy that it forms, and from the amount of nutrients that removes from the water column. It can, however, also function as shelter for zooplankton and smaller invertebrates.  Control  A variety of methods are needed to ensure that growth of E. densa is stopped due to its ability to regrow when fragmented through mechanical means. The best way is to remove the plant in entirety from the water column or use herbicides to kill the plant. One of the potential solutions to the problem are water drawdowns, as the plant is very sensitive to drying out and the plant can die in as short as an hour when removed from water. In addition cold weather has been found to be effective in controlling the plant, though this has practical limitations. When herbicides were applied to the plant, the levels of phosphorus and nitrogen increased but not greatly, suggesting that most of the nutrients remained in the plant biomass and did not reabsorb into the water column.

Working in the United States from 1969 until her death, she became Distinguished Professor of English and Dean of Graduate Studies at Rutgers University. A former child actor and scriptwriter, Lansbury was the author of several works of fiction and non-fiction. The latter included The Reasonable Man: Trollope's Legal Fiction (1970), Elizabeth Gaskell: The Novel of Social Crisis (1975), and The Old Brown Dog: Women, Workers, and Vivisection in Edwardian England (1985). Her best-known novel was The Grotto (1989). Lansbury's son, Malcolm Turnbull, became the 29th Prime Minister of Australia. Early life and education Lansbury was born in Melbourne, Victoria, to an English mother, May Lansbury (n√©e Morle), and an Australian father, Oscar Vincent Stephen Lansbury.http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lansbury-coral-magnolia-17182 Her parents were stage actors in London.

In 1948 she won the Henry Lawson poetry prize for Krubi of the Illawarra.https://www.overdrive.com/media/2410248 Chapter \\"Malco\\" She studied Arts (history, anthropology and archaeology) and achieved first-class honours, but she was ineligible to graduate as she had not matriculated. Her student card is in the University of Sydney archives. She was the recipient of the George Arnold Wood Memorial Prize (aeq), awarded annually for proficiency in History II, and the Maud Stiles Memorial Prize (aeq), awarded annually to a woman student for proficiency in History II. She gained her doctorate at the University of Auckland before moving to Philadelphia in the United States in 1969. Career At 19, Lansbury started work at the Australian Broadcasting Commission (as it was then known). Her father worked in the early radio industry in Australia with the ABC, and he got her a part in a radio drama. She worked as both a scriptwriter and actor in radio during its heyday. The National Film and Sound Archive list of the productions with which she is associated as a scriptwriter includes:National Film and Sound Archive Australian Radio Series 1930s to 1970s *Becket: Re- enactment of the relationship between Henry II and Thomas Becket. 104 x 15-min. episodes *Empty Arms: Drama serial about adoption and the effect on the mother. 104 x 15-min. episodes *Fallen Angel: Angel, a successful model whose husband dies leaving her with a newborn child. 146 x 15-min. episodes (1955) *Judith: Based on the biblical story of Judith, played by actress Judi Farr. 104 x 15-min. episodes. *The Reverend Matthew: A story about a country minister. 1105 x 15-min. episodes (1956‚Äì59) *Stairway to Fame: Cast included Sheila Sewell, Ray Barrett, Dinah Shearing, Lyndall Barbour, John Meillon, Max Orbiston, Margo Lee, Neva Carr Glyn, Ruth Cracknell, Queenie Ashton. 208 episodes (c. 1954) *Thirty Minutes To Go: Mystery drama. 30 minutes. *This Was Sylvia: Dramatic story of a beautiful and insatiably ambitious woman. 208 x 15-min. episodes. 1956 *True Dog Stories: Stories about different breeds of dogs. 26 x 15-min. episodes (1960s) She worked for the ABC into the 1960s but as television supplanted radio drama she turned more to academic interests. After gaining her doctorate, Lansbury worked as an academic in the United States. Her major interest was Victorian literature. Between 1975 and 1984 she wrote four books on Anthony Trollope and other Victorian literary figures. She served as president of the Victorian Studies Association and of the Victorian executive committee of the Modern Language Association. She became Professor of English at Rutgers University in New Jersey and the first dean of the Graduate School at the Camden Campus. Lansbury wrote five works of fiction: Ringarra (1985), Sweet Alice (1986), Felicity (1987), The Grotto (1989), and Opium!, published posthumously. One of her book reviewers was her son, Malcolm Turnbull. He wrote in his regular column in The Bulletin magazine in 1981, of The Reasonable Man: Trollope's Legal Fiction (1970): \\"It is refreshing, if not surprising, to find someone who maintains that that most pellucid of novelists, Anthony Trollope, owed his literary style to the law.... The book provides a fresh insight into the novels of Trollope and to an explanation for his style.\\" Personal life Lansbury's first marriage was to radio producer George Edwards, her godfather and friend of her father, on 20 February 1953. Edwards had enjoyed some fame as Dad in Dad and Dave from Snake Gully. Lansbury was his fourth wife and was 40 years his junior. The next day, he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia and died six months later, on 28 August 1953. Lansbury had a \\"whirlwind romance\\" with Bruce Turnbull, who became her second husband, and in 1954, she gave birth prematurely to her son, Malcolm Turnbull. In 1963, she moved to New Zealand after separating from Bruce Turnbull, and later married John Salmon, a university professor. Her son, Malcolm, was raised by his father after she left the family home when Malcolm was 10 years old. Death Lansbury died of bowel cancer on 3 April 1991, aged 61, at her home in Philadelphia.

It is shown simultaneously by all local TV stations in mainland China, making it one of the world's most-watched programmes. It has been broadcast since 1 January 1978. This program is used as a medium for the state to announce government announcements and meetings, commentaries on major economic and policy issues, and the activities of national leaders. The program reflects official positions of the Chinese Communist Party on a wide range of matters. Some accuse the program as serving more as a means for the party to divulge its political agenda rather than to examine the day's important news events. As with other national media outlets of comparable size, it has been criticized both within China and internationally for its lack of neutrality. Despite declining popularity, it remains a widely watched program. Name, format, and distribution There is no standard English translation of the name. Variants in use include \\"Evening News\\" and \\"Network News Broadcast\\". An Oxford dictionary gives news hook-up. The Chinese name contains two words: \\"Xinwen\\" (/) meaning \\"news\\" and \\"Lianbo\\" (/) closely translating to \\"joint broadcast\\" or \\"simulcast\\", referring to the fact that material is broadcast by all provincial and civic television stations (usually their channel one) in China, which guarantee that audience could watch the programme by Terrestrial television all over the country. And all the provincial TV stations have correspondents and reporters that are obliged to provide the programme with news reports and features from their respective areas. The programme consists of a daily news bulletin of approximately thirty minutes, beginning with the headlines and proceeding to detailed reports.See the Duowei external link below, passim. In special circumstances, the broadcast is extended beyond the 30 minutes allotted when deemed necessary. For example, in 1997, the death of Deng Xiaoping extended Xinwen Lianbo broadcast beyond the regular time for over a week. The announcers are shown seated, with a window into the control room behind them.See this edition at 00:16, where a lady clearly walks behind the window: The format has hardly varied for three decades, even its details. Mandarin language is always used, in accordance with government language policies, and throughout the broadcast the language is formal and flowery. The delivery is stilted, without happy talk or humour. Prior to January 2013, Xinwen Lianbo never included \\"two-ways\\" (where the anchor conducts direct dialogue with a reporter or a commentator) or live reports before January 2013, (although it did air live reports of the launch of the Chang'e 2 lunar satellite on October 1, 2010). The first live report was made on January 26, 2013.They have implemented only Vizrt-powered graphics since the September 25, 2011 newscast. , the opening titles and music had been substantially unchanged since 1988. The programme justifies its title with a comprehensive distribution system that has led the Washington Post to dub it \\"one of the world's most-watched news programs.\\" Calculations based on official statistics suggest as many as 135 million people tune in each day, which makes sense if one considers the large number people who live in China. The Wall Street Journal calculated in 2006 that it had fourteen times the audience of the highest-rated US news show. The initial 19:00 CST of primetime television evening-nightly news bulletin is broadcast simultaneously on CCTV-1 and CCTV-13 (simulcast on CCTV) and on the primary channel of each four municipalities stations (Beijing Television, Radio and Television of Shanghai, Shanghai Television, Shanghai Satellite Television, Shanghai Mandarin Oriental Television, Chongqing Television and Tianjin Television). CCTV-13 usually repeats the programme at 9:00 pm (21:00 hours), CCTV-4 usually repeats the programme at 2:00 am (02:00 hours) and CCTV-1 usually repeats the programme at 4:59 am while there are later repeats dubbed into selected minority languages for viewers in appropriate regions (as of 2006, at least Mongolian and Tibetan). This ensures that urban cable viewers may see around half the available channels carrying the programme, while it is often carried on all the available terrestrial television channels in rural China. On 17 July 2020, Xinwen Lianbo transitioned to 16:9 high definition format. = Presenters = It is always presented by two news presenters, usually one male and one female. From 1989 to 2006, the main newscasters were Xing Zhibin and Luo Jing, assisted by four others. On June 5, 2006, two younger newscasters were introduced, namely Li Zimeng and Kang Hui.

Political significance =News values= Effectively, Xinwen Lianbo is a mouthpiece for the party and the state. As with all news broadcasts in mainland China, the running order is dictated by the socio-political importance of the individual or group concerned (rather than other news values). Therefore, the activities of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China are almost always the first item, followed by reports on the members of the Politburo Standing Committee in rank order. Diplomatic engagements are usually shown before domestic engagements. Significant statements from the Central People's Government or the Communist Party of China have been read out, in full, after the headlines.See this edition at 01:09, where a Party announcement related to the 17th Party Congress preceded coverage of the one-year countdown to the Beijing Olympics: When significant events or speeches are covered, the camera will carefully pan across the Politburo Standing Committee.See this edition, where Standing Committee members are mentioned by rank at 00:42 and shown at approx. 01:50: The program has been heavily criticized for its formulaic presentation of news items and its heavy focus on party and state leaders, and its lack of critical focus. Around half of the programming on average is dedicated to political content: party announcements, government meetings, or leaders' activities. =News orientation= The programme plays a role in the CPC's communication mechanisms at both the mass and √©lite levels. Zhan Jiang, professor at China Youth University for Political Sciences, aptly summed up its content in three phrases: \\"The leaders are busy, the motherland is developing rapidly, other countries are in chaos.\\" On the one hand, it is the news source with the widest reach amongst China's large population, and so it provides the Party with the opportunity to influence the masses. According to Li, watching the bulletin has traditionally been \\"a national ritual at the family dinner table.\\" On the other hand, it has been used as a mechanism to signal changes and continuities in policy and personnel. New policies have been introduced by special features, such as the 'model cadre' used to promote Three Represents in 2002. The ranked shots of the Politburo Standing Committee indicate their relative power: \\"Each leader is allocated a certain number of seconds in front of the camera, Chinese media experts say, with the time for each one carefully regulated by the party propaganda department.\\" This lies behind the programme's extreme formality, because any miscommunication could have serious consequences. Declining popularity All CCTV programmes are under commercial pressure, but Xinwen Lianbo is less-affected than most. It has few competitors, though Hong Kong's Phoenix Television and Shanghai's Dragon TV news shows' are competition.. Note that the station's Chinese name translates as \\"Eastern TV\\" or \\"Oriental TV\\". It is the flagship station of the Shanghai Media Group. It is also one of CCTV's major earners. While there are no commercials during the show, the slots immediately afterwards have sold for US$100,000 each,Dean and Fowler, op.cit. CCTV commercial spots have sold through a complex auction process, so this is likely to be an estimate. and the five-second slot just before 7 pm has been the most expensive CCTV offered, worth 24 million RMB in 2003 (about 7% of CCTV's annual advertising revenue). The China Daily reported that interest in the programme has declined, only receiving 10% of the audience share market compared to 40% before 1998. This was due in part to reporting of official government announcements, which have attracted little interest. After June 20, 2009, Xinwen Lianbo has focused more on critical reporting and human-interest stories.CCTV to revamp flagship news program, China Daily, June 10, 2009 Overview =Broadcast time= All times are (UTC+08:00).

Controversies =Very erotic very violent= On 27 December 2007, Xinwen Lianbo aired a report about the wide and easy availability of explicit content on the internet. The report appealed to juristic institutions and government to hurry to make relevant legislation in order to purify the internet environment. In the report, a young student described a pop-up advertisement she saw as being \\"very erotic very violent\\". After the airing of the report, many parodies were posted by internet users ridiculing the comment and CCTV's credibility in part. The incident also questioned the reliability of Xinwen Lianbo, noting the unlikelihood of a web page being both violent and erotic at the same time (even though such pages do exist), and the age of the student interviewed. Personal information of the interviewed girl was later also leaked, identifying the girl in the report by name.Kuso events caused by ‚Äúvery erotic very violent\\", on 7 January 2008, Yangtze Evening News Online message boards were populated by large threads about the incident, and a satirical work even stated that CCTV's website was the number one \\"very erotic very violent\\" website on the internet, with some users even creating their own toplists of sites which meet these criteria, the \\"top 8 very erotic very violent sports events\\" and even identifying things that are yellow as being erotic (since ÈªÑ, hu√°ng, the Mandarin character for \\"yellow\\", also means \\"erotic\\"). =Chengdu J-10 footage= On 23 January 2011, the program showcased the Chengdu J-10 in the air by firing a missile at an airplane, the target plane then exploded.

He accompanied William of Orange to England in 1688. After fighting against Jacobite forces in Ireland, Lillingstone received his first command in 1692, when he took over the colonelcy of Jonathan Foulkes's Regiment on the latter's death. On assuming command the regiment became Luke Lillingstone's Regiment of Foot, and was to be the first of three regiments to bear this title. Lillingstone's regiment was disbanded in 1694, but was reraised the same year for service in the West Indies. This second regiment was disbanded in 1696 or 1697. 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot , (regiments.org), accessed 11 September 2007 150px Lillingstone was without a command until 1705, when he was authorised to raise a regiment of foot. The third Lillingstone's Regiment was duly raised at the King's Head, Bird Street, Lichfield on 25 March 1705. The regiment was ordered to Antigua in 1707, but Lillingstone did not accompany it. In 1708 Lillingstone was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general, and ordered to join his regiment. He refused, and was dismissed on 2 June. Lillingstone's Regiment was given to his second-in- command, becoming James Jones's Regiment of Foot. The regiment continued in existence, becoming the 38th Regiment of Foot in 1751, one of the forebears of the modern Mercian Regiment. Lillingstone was refused the purchase price of his regiment, and this led to the forced sale of his estate, Ferriby Grange, North Ferriby, in the East Riding of Yorkshire. Lillingstone was married twice, but had no male issue. Lillingstone died on 6 April 1713, and a monument to his memory was erected in the parish church of All Saints, North Ferriby.

It consists of five cylindrical towers, with the ride simulating a trip into space and re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.Coaster Kingdom > Europa Park > Euro Mir > Our Thoughts The largest tower, which contains the helical lift hill, is a dodecagon, across and high while the maximum drop of the ride is . The ride opened in 1997 and carries nine trains, each comprising four circular spinning cars. Riders are seated back to back in pairs, with a maximum of 16 riders per train.

Life =Early life= Gerverot was born in Lun√©ville. His father was a \\"musicus\\" (singer) at the court of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, former king of Poland, who became in 1737 the duke of Lotharingen. His mother, Barbe Oubert, sent him to the porcelain factory in S√®vres in 1764, to learn his trade. Possibly he had himself already asked to specialize in the painting of porcelain with flowers and (fantastical) birds. Gerverot became extremely able in the preparation of colour, clay mixtures, and (since his stay in Niderviller) in other trade secrets. His urge to travel and to turn his knowledge into money (or his inability to stay in any one place for long) resulted in his short periods in various porcelain factories. In succession, he was active in Ludwigsburg, Ansbach, H√∂chst, F√ºrstenberg and Frankenthal. =Weesp and Loosdrecht= In 1767, Gerverot won a large sum in the city lottery of Mainz. In 1769, he came to Weesp, and worked in the porcelain factory of Bertrand Philip, count of Gronsveld, former envoy in Berlin, and now drost of Muiden and president of the Admiralty of Amsterdam. Production and activity did not take off and thus this enterprise, Holland's first porcelain factory, closed in 1771. Gerverot left for the faience- or porcelain factory of Offenbach am Main, H√∂chst and Ellwangen. In nearby Schrezheim, Gerverot worked at his own expense. Minister Joannes de Mol sent Gerverot a portrait of a minister-colleague in 1774 from which he made a bust, and in return de Mol brought Gerverot up to Oud-Loosdrecht as a manager, painter and pigment-maker. The designing of new models was not his strongest suit, but nevertheless Gerverot deserved his new salary, of 150 guilder per month. =Amsterdam= Gerverot possibly lived an unconventional life, as may be seen from the fact that in 1776 he witnessed the christening of a child in the French Roman Catholic chapel. The child was named Louis Victor George d' Onis, with his father noted as George Alexander d' Onis and his mother a black woman, named Coba. The legality of their marriage was called into doubt by the authorities. Gerverot in 1777 married Modesta Johanna Salomons, from Hamburg. In Amsterdam, they had three children: Louis Victor (born 1778), Johannes Victor (born 1780) and Georg Samuel (born in 1783, but buried in Amsterdam in 1784). L.V. Gerverot lived in the Plantage (plantation), then a large park with inns, speelhuizen (playhouses, where billiards was played) and brothels, now Artis and its surroundings. All his children were baptized at home, since he did not belong to a particular church. On 1 March 1779, Gerverot was dismissed in Loosdrecht, having lent De Mol 28,000 guilder. Cooperation seemed to be impossible. Gerverot opened a porcelain store in Amsterdam, but early in 1788 had to declare bankruptcy. (This period in the life of Gerverot is unclear. It may be that he also worked in Cologne, M√ºnster and Hanover). Gerverot traveled to England and took employment with John Turner, one of Wedgwood's most significant competitors. In 1795, his purse again empty, he arrived in Brunswick and was taken on once more at the F√ºrstenberg factory. Two years later he was its manager. Under his leadership the factory became commercially successful for the first time in its existence. In 1814, Gerverot was dismissed for collaboration with the French. He died at Bevern.

An applicant (the injured party) usually sues the respondent (the owner or occupier) under common law based on negligence and/or damages. Claims are usually successful when it can be shown that the owner/occupier was responsible for an injury, therefore they breached their duty of care. The duty of care is very complex, but in basic terms it is the standard by which one would expect to be treated whilst one is in the care of another. Once a breach of duty of care has been established, an action brought in a common law court would most likely be successful. Based on the injuries and the losses of the applicant the court would award a financial compensation package.  The law of insurance and public liability  In the course of managing any property, one is obligated to comply with laws and statutes administered by government and municipal bodies. These bodies impose various liabilities of which the property owner/manager should be aware. The most common examples of statute liability are in areas where an individual is required by law to effect insurance, e.g. workers' compensation and motor vehicle compulsory third party. Property, hotel and operations managers should become familiar with the various types of contracts involved in commercial and retail activities. These cover a wide field but the more significant contracts are: *the head lease or the management agreements *tenancy and casual leasing agreements *contracts with independent contractors for cleaning, lift and escalator maintenance, air conditioning and fire protection maintenance, etc. The major contractual liability from an insurance viewpoint is undoubtedly found in head lease and management agreements. These require the manager or head lessee to fully maintain, repair and replace the property, if damaged, until expiration of the agreement or lease. Furthermore, the contracts usually require an indemnity to the owner against liabilities imposed upon the business for injuries and property damage arising out of the use, occupation or management of the property. Every contract contains covenants imposing responsibilities on one or other of the parties. These should be carefully examined to ensure they are not unduly onerous.  Degrees of duty of care  Owner/occupiers are required to provide a certain level of care. The duty of care is not the same for all people. It is dependent on a number of issues. To assist in establishing the duty of care required it is more clear to divide into groups the individuals who use premises and for what reasons. An example of this would be in the context of a large shopping complex, whereby the following groups of individuals would attract different levels of care. = Invitees = Invitees are people who by some form have been invited into the complex. This invitation can be through marketing and advertising, or it can be implied simply because the building is a shopping complex or hotel. The greatest duty of care is owed to invitees who, in the case of shopping centres and hotels, are mainly customers, contractors and sub contractors. They are there because of the invitation extended to them. The duty of care owed to them is relatively simple. One must take reasonable care to ensure the premises are safe. They in turn must take reasonable care for their own safety. If however an invitee spends money for a service, i.e. forms a contract with the owner, increasing the duty of care owed. An example of this could be a games arcade where the invitee pays for a ride on a motorcycle game. If, as a result of playing this game, the invitee is electrocuted, the owner has breached their duty of care and will most likely be found to be liable for any damages. If, however, the reason for the electrocution was not due to the owner's negligence but a product defect, and the owner has done all that is reasonably expected of an arcade owner to detect and fix this defect, the owner may proceed to sue the supplier of the game. This is because the supplier also owns a duty of care to the arcade owner as well as a contractual duty to provide safe, functioning equipment. = Licensees = These are people who enter premises with the permission of the occupier but, unlike invitees, do so without any economic advantage to the occupier. They come in the hope of doing business with the owner or their tenants and include such people as salesmen, commercial travellers, etc. The duty of care owed to licensees are not quite as extreme as in the case of the invitees. = Trespassers = These are classified as people who intrude onto property without permission. The degree of care owed to trespassers, although slight, nevertheless exists particularly in situations where a source of danger is deliberately created or where small children are involved. An example would be where live wires were left exposed after the centre had closed. If some children entered the premises for some reason, despite that reason, if they were injured the owner of the centre would be liable.

In 2001, amidst great popular pressure and a media circus (defined at times as a \\"public lynching\\" of the accused), a jury trial convicted 52-year-old Mar√≠a Dolores \\"Loli\\" V√°zquez, the estranged lover of Wanninkhof's mother, Alicia Hornos, for the murder, even though there was no evidence relating her to the crime. This miscarriage of justice has been blamed on prejudices about V√°zquez's homosexuality and the fabrication of an unsubstantiated narrative about her being a \\"dominant\\", \\"predatory\\" lesbian who had seduced Hornos and later killed Wanninkhof because she blamed her for the end of the relationship.Gimeno Reinoso, B. (2008) La construcci√≥n de la lesbiana perversa: Visibilidad y representaci√≥n de las lesbianas. GEDISA, 256 pages. Others have also cited malinterpretations of V√°zquez's behavior due to her Galician extraction and traditional British education being in dissonance with local social norms, attitudes and expectations. Three months after V√°zquez's conviction, the High Court of Andalusia overturned the sentence and ordered a new trial. However, all charges against V√°zquez were dropped when DNA found near Wanninkhof's body was matched to Tony Alexander King, a 32-year-old British sexual offender with a long criminal history in the United Kingdom, and who was also identified through DNA as the perpetrator of the murder of 17-year-old Sonia Carabantes in Co√≠n, in 2003. King was convicted of both murders and sentenced to 55 years in prison. The whole affair is popularly known in Spain as the Wanninkhof Case (Caso Wanninkhof). V√°zquez's conviction has been named as the biggest miscarriage of justice in the judiciary history of Spain since the 1910 \\"Crime of Cuenca\\". Antecedents View of Mijas from Benalm√°dena. =Alicia Hornos and Dolores V√°zquez= Roc√≠o was born in 1979 to Willem \\"Guillermo\\" Wanninkhof, a Dutch citizen, and his Spanish wife Hilaria Alicia Hornos (known as Alicia), a native of Arroyo del Ojanco in rural Ja√©n province. She had a sister and a brother. Hornos, who claims that Willem Wanninkhof was a domestic abuser, began her relationship with V√°zquez while she was still married, in 1982. The following year, Hornos left her husband - who returned to the Netherlands - and moved in with V√°zquez. The two purchased a house together, although V√°zquez was named as the sole proprietor in the contract. After her divorce in 1983, Hornos kept legal custody of the children and she raised them with V√°zquez as the couple's own. Roc√≠o and her sister Rosa said that they had two mothers at their school, and they signed several times with the surnames \\"V√°zquez Hornos\\" in place of their legal name, Wanninkhof Hornos. Such was the case of Roc√≠o's own personal diaries. Rosa also claimed that her own relation with V√°zquez was one of \\"affection\\", even at the height of the media frenzy incriminating V√°zquez. Though Hornos and V√°zquez ended their relationship in 1988, they continued to live together for a while, and generally remained on good terms until around 1994. The detonator of their enmity may have been a dispute over the ownership of the house and other properties, according to Hornos's sister-in-law. Hornos continued to reside in Mijas with her children, and later began a new relationship with a Spanish man, Juan Cerrillo, that was ongoing at the time of Roc√≠o's murder and V√°zquez's trial. =Tony Alexander King= King was born Anthony \\"Tony\\" Bromwich in 1967. He claimed he was physically abused by his older brother as a child. In 1986, when he was 19, he was sentenced to ten years in a detention center for young delinquents for the non-fatal strangulation and sexual abuse of five women in the London district of Holloway. One victim was also thrown against the pavement during the attack, resulting in the fracture of her nose and jaw. King, who always attacked on Monday and Wednesday because he was with his fianc√©e on the other days, never penetrated his victims because he was sexually impotent. King was released in 1991 from HMP Grendon where he had undergone Therapy to ‚ÄòAddress‚Äô his offending behaviour, after serving only half of his sentence. But was rearrested six months later for robbing a woman at gunpoint. He was then recluded in regular prison until 1996. Shortly after his release, he changed his name, which is allowed to people convicted in cases of great public notoriety in the United Kingdom. The same year, he married Chilean-born Cecilia Matilde Pantoja when she was two months pregnant with their daughter, Sabrina. King told Pantoja that he had antecedents for armed robbery, but claimed that he had been forced into it because of poverty. In August 1997, King threatened a Hungarian woman with a knife and attempted to rape her in Leatherhead train station. The attack was recorded by a security camera; after the film was broadcast on BBC One's Crimewatch on September 2, Scotland Yard received numerous calls from viewers who identified the attacker as King. An order of arrest was issued the next day, but King and his wife had already fled to M√°laga and found refuge in its large British community. Six months later, British police located King in Mijas, where he was working as a real estate agent, and requested him to return voluntarily to the United Kingdom. When he refused, they informed Spain's Ministry of the Interior of King's presence in M√°laga, but this notice was labeled \\"low risk\\" and was not accompanied by a petition of arrest and extradition. Alicia Hornos worked in King's firm as a maid, but they never interacted. King's wife (who continued to use his surname) abandoned him in 2000, citing economic problems and her own fear that he was involved in Wanninkhof's murder. However, she didn't report her suspicions to Police, and they were reported to have remained in contact and in good terms by other people. In 2001, King began to work in a local English pub called \\"Chicken Shack\\", where he became friends with a coworker named Simon Bowers. Bowers later moved to Alhaur√≠n el Grande and opened his own bar there, \\"The Simon Arms\\", employing King as a cook, waiter and bouncer. While working there, King met a local school janitor, Mariluz Gallego, and he moved in with her and her three children. The home they lived in was inside the school and next to a Spanish Civil Guard station. However, King only interacted with the officers once in 2001, when he was questioned for poaching rabbits. Following his arrest in 2003, the British tabloids News of the World and The Sun claimed that British police were investigating King as a suspect in twelve unsolved murders of women in the United Kingdom that had taken place between 1987 and 1994. Scotland Yard dismissed this information as \\"pure speculation\\". However, it was later announced that King would be interrogated as a suspect in the 2002 murder of Milly Dowler. Murder =Disappearance= Road to Fuengirola at night. Wanninkhof said goodbye to her mother and sister around 17:30 of October 9, 1999. She walked the 500 meters between her home in the Mijas residential area \\"La Cortijera\\" and her boyfriend's home in La Cala de Mijas, where she stayed until 21:30. According to her boyfriend, she left then with the intention of taking a shower and changing clothes in her home, before reuniting with him and other friends in Fuengirola's fair later that night. This was the first and only time that she made the return trip alone and on foot; usually she would either be driven home by her boyfriend or picked up at his home by her mother or sister. A foreign resident that passed away before V√°zquez's trial was the last person to see her alive, walking from La Cala to Mijas. Wanninkhof's mother and sister contacted her boyfriend and friends the next day, all of whom denied to have seen her at the fair. Though already alarmed, Hornos decided to go for a walk with Cerrillo to ease herself, rather than reporting Wanninkhof's disappearance right away. During this walk, the couple found a pair of running shoes that they identified as Wanninkhof's, a napkin and several blood stains in a vacant lot next to the road used by her. They alerted the Civil Guard, who cordoned the area and started the search with the help of Wanninkhof's family and over one thousand neighbors. Despite the absence of the body, it was apparent to law enforcement from the beginning that Wanninkhof had been murdered. A blood trail began at 1'10 meters from the sidewalk and continued to a blood pool large enough to have caused her death from exsanguination. Next to the pool were dragging marks, and crossing over them and the blood, there were tire tracks made by a small vehicle with a tire model that went out of production in 1993. Because the dragging marks continued over severely inclined terrain that would have made it difficult for one person to drag a body alone, it was believed that the body was dragged by at least two people, then left in a less exposed area of the vacant lot before the vehicle was brought in to transport the body to another location. \\"Three or four days\\" after the disappearance, a taxi driver came forward to say that the night of the crime, at 22:00, he dodged an off-road vehicle driving on the wrong lane at the exact point on the road where the running shoes were found. When the vehicle passed his own, he heard a high-pitched \\"shriek or scream\\" that scared him. On October 16, DNA testing confirmed that the blood belonged to Wanninkhof. Despite the evidence, the family and friends of Wanninkhof stated that they believed she was still alive. A couple that employed her as an au pair offered a reward of two million pesetas for any useful information about her disappearance, and an English resident offered ten million for her safe return. =Discovery of the body= Wanninkhof's body was found on November 2 near the sporting club \\"Los Altos del Rodeo\\", between Marbella and San Pedro de Alc√°ntara. It was nude, disfigured, stabbed nine times, partially mummified and skeletonized. The advanced state of decomposition, only three weeks after the disappearance, raised doubts about its identity. This was attributed successively to carbonization, acid corrosion and flesh-eating wasps. However, Wanninkhof's sister recognized some rings, two T-shirts and other objects found in two trash bags near the body as belonging to Roc√≠o. The T-shirts were torn by the stabs, and no clothes from the waist down were ever found. The autopsy confirmed that it was indeed Wanninkhof's body, and also revealed that she had been beaten first, then stabbed once in the left section of the chest, likely when she tried to flee. This stab was the most damaging, as it affected several organs and pulmonary arteries. As a result, Wanninkhof became instantly paralyzed or unconscious, and her death was quick. Once on the ground, she was stabbed eight more times on a small area of the back, in quick succession, with the likely aim of ensuring her death. The wounds were all caused by the same weapon: a thin, single-edged razor. Sexual assault could not be proven either way, due to the advanced decomposition of the body. The body was left on the ground for several hours before the killer returned and put it on the car, and was later deposited, not thrown, in the second location. It was partially covered by bushes and fallen leaves when it was found. Because a number eight was drawn on one of the bags, it was believed that the bags were not acquired with the intention of using them in a murder, but that they had been repurposed after being already used. The killer was also believed to be familiar with the area where the body was abandoned, as it was only accessible by a trail perpendicular to the N-340 highway, which was very difficult to see from the road. =Suspects= Trial of Dolores V√°zquez The trial was done with a popular jury which is a system with no tradition in Spain, having been newly implemented. Most factual evidence exculpated her but the prosecutor relied heavily in attacking the character of Dolores and her lesbian relationship with Roc√≠o's mother Alicia. The verdict repeated word for word the prosecutor's allegations and found Dolores guilty of the murder of Roc√≠o. She was sentenced to serve 15 years in prison. All this was conducted in the middle of a media circus and feeding frenzy. Dolores appealed and the higher court agreed and declared the case should be retried. Murder of Sonia Carabantes While she was in prison awaiting her new trial, in August 2003, there was a similar crime when 17-year-old Sonia Carabantes disappeared. In their investigation of this case the police discovered DNA which matched DNA found at the scene of the murder of Roc√≠o. A woman soon told police that she suspected her ex-husband and when the police questioned him it was soon discovered that it was, indeed, his DNA. His name was Tony Alexander King and he was an English immigrant who, with his wife and daughter had come to live in southern Spain. It turned out he had a long criminal history and had served time in England for sexual crimes before changing his name and settling in Spain. Dolores' upcoming trial was first suspended and then the case was closed and she was set free having been 17 months in prison. Trial of Tony Alexander King In 2005 Tony Alexander King was sentenced to 36 years in prison for the death of Sonia Carabantes and to an additional seven years for an unrelated sexual attack he had committed. In 2006 he was found guilty of the death of Roc√≠o Wanninkhof and was sentenced to 19 years in prison for that crime. Aftermath Despite V√°zquez's exoneration and subsequent conviction of King, Hornos remains convinced that V√°zquez was involved in her daughter's murder and has stated this belief repeatedly. She also denies to be homosexual or bisexual, despite admitting her past relationship with V√°zquez, and blames the latter on V√°zquez's manipulation alone. =Post-trial legal proceedings= =Death of Sabrina King= Criticism =Press coverage= =Self-isolation of British communities in Spain= British-oriented business in Mijas with English-only signs. In 2003 it was estimated that the whole province was home to 180,000 permanent British residents and four or five times more transient ones, in addition to seven English-language newspapers, eight English-language radio stations and numerous real estate firms and pubs staffed and catered to British customers only. In media A miniseries called El Caso Wanninkhof was released on television, with Valentina Bargue√±o starring Roc√≠o.

The game, published by WizKids, saw first release in May 2006 and was officially canceled in March 2007. Game summary Two or more players vie for influence in an attempt to win control of the Colonial Fleet. A player loses the game when his or her influence is reduced to zero, and wins the game either when he or she achieves 20 influence or all opponents have lost. Because it is possible for these conditions to be achieved simultaneously, ties may occur. There is no limit on the number of players in a game. Players primarily lose influence by failing to provide a defender when another player initiates a challenge, or by failing to respond to a Cylon threat. Play sequence Turns consist of three phases, with all players working through each phase before moving onto the next phase. The phases are defined as follows: # Ready Phase ‚Äì During the ready phase, players ready and restore existing cards, draw two new cards, and may then play a card as a supply card or asset. # Execution Phase ‚Äì Players alternate playing a card, playing an ability, challenging, or resolving a mission. When both players have passed consecutively, the phase ends. # Cylon Phase ‚Äì If the Cylon threat level of the face-up alert and reserve cards exceeds the fleet defense level, the Cylons attack. When this occurs, each player reveals a Cylon threat, and each player must then challenge a threat or pass (losing one influence) until no threats remain or everyone has passed. The player who goes first in all situations is the player with the lowest current influence at the start of the current phase. Card types * Bases ‚Äì Cards which are not part of the main play deck. Each player reveals a base card at the start of the game, and this card determines a number of factors, including starting hand size and influence. * Events ‚Äì Events which have an immediate effect on the game. * Personnel ‚Äì Individuals or characters from the universe of Battlestar Galactica. * Missions ‚Äì A task or mission which a player's fleet can attempt. Players typically resolve missions by meeting the mission requirements using face-up alert units. * Ships ‚Äì Space-going vessels or ships from Battlestar Galactica. Deck composition Each player's deck must contain at least 60 cards, with no more than four copies of any one card. Cards with the same title but different subtitles count as different cards. Players must also supply a single base card, which does not count towards the 60-card minimum. Products Cards are available both in a two-player starter set and in booster packs. The two- player starter set can be split to form two 31-card decks for two players, or can be used to make a single 61-card deck (removing the spare base card). It includes a quick-start ruleset, a complete rulebook, and 62 fixed cards: 10 cards exclusive to the starter deck (5 are foil cards), and 52 others.

Wiz Kids announced on March 13, 2007 that they were discontinuing development of the expansion. Concepts and comparisons to existing games The Battlestar Galactica Collectible Card Game borrows a number of its game mechanics or concepts from existing collectible card games. This includes: * Assets / supply cards ‚Äì The concept of any card being able to be used as a resource card instead of for its normal use. This mechanic is used in games such as the Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game and the VS System. * Mystic values ‚Äì The concept of generating a random number by flipping a card from the top of the deck into the discard pile and consulting one of the fields on the card which was revealed. This mechanic is used in games such as the original Star Wars Customizable Card Game by Decipher as well as the Legend of the Five Rings. * Cylon attacks ‚Äì The concept of a rogue enemy element in the game that is dangerous to all players is very similar to the Wanderer mechanic from Allegiance: War of Factions. * Use of rounds instead of turns ‚Äì This mechanic, where all players work through the same phase of the game simultaneously before proceeding to the next, has been used in a number of previous games, including Doomtown and Allegiance. The general feel of the game is understandably similar to earlier science fiction games, most notably the Star Trek Customizable Card Game (which itself featured missions that could be completed by having the appropriate traits available). Game cancellation Officially announced on the Wizkids website on 13 March 2007, Battlestar Galactica CCG has been cancelled.Battlestar Galactica Collectible Card Game From the official announcement: \\"We are sorry to announce that the next expansion for the Battlestar Galactica CCG, Martial Law, previously planned for February, will not be releasing.

He notably played in the Premier League for Leicester City, having also played for Nuneaton Borough and Cambridge United on loan. He joined Grimsby Town in 1996 and remained with the club until 2001 where he then retired through injury. Career =Leicester City= Born in Lutterworth, Leicestershire Smith joined Leicester City as a junior and came through the club's youth setup. In 1988, he was added to the first team squad by then manager David Pleat. He went on to play under Brian Little, Mark McGhee and Martin O'Neill at Filbert Street and spent a loan spell with Cambridge United in 1989. He played in several Premier League seasons with The Foxes, the last of which was the 1994‚Äì1995 season when the club were relegated to the First Division. He would go on to make 120 first team appearances in all competitions, scoring twice. =Grimsby Town= In September 1995, Smith was loaned to fellow First Division side Grimsby Town. He would make 8 appearances for Brian Laws side during this spell which led to him joining the club permanently in March 1996 when Leicester and Grimsby agreed a ¬£50,000 transfer fee. In his time at Grimsby he was in and out of the team both under Laws and his replacement Alan Buckley. The Mariners defensive set up in the mid to late nineties had boasted such club legends as Mark Lever, Peter Handyside, John McDermott, Graham Rodger and Kevin Jobling, so Smith was dipped in and out of the first team. The club were eventually relegated to the Second Division in May 1997, only to bounce back the following season by winning the Second Division Play-Off Final at Wembley Stadium. Town had also triumphed in the Football League Trophy that season, but injury had forced Smith to miss the entire season. During his final three seasons at Grimsby, Smith continued to play a cameo role in the first team with numerous injury problems preventing him from having any lengthy spell in the team. In his final season the 2000-2001 campaign, he managed only 7 games, scoring once. In what would be his final game in professional football he played the full 90 minutes of an FA Cup third round reply defeat at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 16 January 2001. His final goal had come earlier in that season during a 2‚Äì2 away draw with Wimbledon F.C.. The Mariners now managed by Lennie Lawrence saw fit to release Smith from his contract in June 2001 due to his ongoing injury concerns, this eventually led to his retirement from professional football at the age of 30.

It is adjacent to the Royal Route, at Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie 26/28. Originally built in 1637-41, it was first rebuilt in 1660 for King John II Casimir (, from whom it takes its name) and again in 1765-68, by Domenico Merlini, for the Corps of Cadets established by King Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus. Since 1816, the Kazimierz Palace has served intermittently as the seat of Warsaw University (which was closed by the Russian Imperial authorities after each Uprising on the part of their Polish subjects, and in 1939-44 by the Germans). History =Origin= Prince Zygmunt Kazimierz Vasa in the palace's loggia, facing the Vistula River, 1644 Villa Regia (\\"Royal Villa\\"), 1656 The Kazimierz Palace was erected in 1637-41 for King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV in the mannerist-early Baroque style as a villa suburbana (suburban villa) christened the Villa Regia (Latin for \\"Royal Villa\\"), to the design of Italian architect Giovanni Trevano. It was constructed as a rectangular building with corner towers, a type of residence known as Poggio‚ÄìReale - Serlio after the Villa Poggio Reale in Naples. The Villa Regia had a magnificent loggia at its garden facade, with a wonderful view of the Vistula River and its opposite, Praga bank. It had four alcoves and two gardens ‚Äî a flower garden at the front, and a botanical garden at the rear. Both gardens were adorned with sculptures that had been procured by royal architect Agostino Locci. Some had been purchased in Florence for 7,000 guldens, others had been produced in Prague by Adrien de Vries. According to Adam Jarzƒôbski, they had included a Hercules Fighting the Centaur Nessus and a Horse Bitten by a Snake. Another feature of the gardens was a large arbor where initially the Fleming royal painter Christian Melich had his studio, but which was later selected by Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga as the venue for her literary salon. The palace had rich furnishings, with Venetian-style gilded ceilings (surviving examples of such ceilings in Poland may be seen at the Bishop's Palace in Kielce) and brown Chƒôciny and black Dƒôbnik marble portals. In the 1650s, sculptor Giovanni Francesco Rossi created profuse Roman-Baroque- style marble decorations, with busts of Roman emperors and of King John II Casimir and Queen Marie Louise Gonzaga (today displayed at Gripsholm Castle in Sweden). These decorations were so precious that during the Swedish Deluge Sweden's King Charles X Gustav ordered the very window frames pulled out and transported to Sweden. The Villa Regia had a large concert hall, decorated with an oil-painted plafond depicting St. Cecilia, patron saint of music and of Queen Cecila Renata, where the Royal Cappella Vasa gave frequent concerts, and a large collection of ancient sculptures which would be plundered during the Deluge by Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, and taken to Berlin; while the garden sculptures were taken to Sweden. Then, having been plundered, the palace was burned. Su≈Çkowski's palace Following the devastations wrought by the Deluge, the Villa Regia was rebuilt twice, in 1652 and 1660, to designs by Izydor Affait or Titus Livius Burattini, and came to be called the \\"Kazimierz Palace\\" for King John II Casimir, who favored it as a residence. Abandoned in 1667, the palace later became the property of King John III Sobieski. In 1695, the building was totally destroyed by fire. =Rebuilding= In about 1724, the property's ownership was transferred to King Augustus II. In this period were constructed an entrance gate at Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie and eight barracks set perpendicularly to the palace fa√ßade. Corps of Cadets, 1785 In 1735, the palace became the property of Count Aleksander J√≥zef Su≈Çkowski. A brickworks, a stove factory and a brewery were established here, and in 1737-39 he rebuilt the palace, probably to a rococo design by Johann Sigmund Deybel and Joachim Daniel von Jauch. The palace was enlarged and covered with mansard roofs. The central portion of the building was adorned with a bulbous top bearing a clock and an eagle. In 1765, ownership was transferred to King Stanis≈Çaw II August, who located the Corps of Cadets here following interior redesigns by Domenico Merlini. From 1769, the famous newspaper sponsored by the King, the Monitor, was printed in an establishment housed in an outbuilding of the palace. On April 5, 1769, the patriotic play Junak was presented on a Cadet Corps stage in the palace. In 1794, after the suppression of the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising, the Corps of Cadets was closed down. =Warsaw University= Kazimierz Palace, 2006 In 1814, a fire destroyed the barracks before the palace, and in 1816 their place was taken initially by two side pavilions designed by Jakub Kubicki. That same year, the palace became the seat of Warsaw University. Concurrently, in 1817‚Äì1831, it also housed the Warsaw Lyceum, a secondary school where Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's father taught French and whose alumni included young Chopin himself. The years 1818-22 saw expansion by two pavilions parallel to Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie, designed by Micha≈Ç Kado. In 1824, the palace was thoroughly rebuilt in the classicist style to the design probably of Hilary Szpilowski and Wac≈Çaw Ritschel. In about 1820, two further pavilions, a northern and a southern one, arose at the palace building itself. Plaque on Warsaw University's Kazimierz Palace, commemorating 1866‚Äì68 student Boles≈Çaw Prus In 1840-41, the next pavilion was built, designed by Antonio Corazzi, originally to be a secondary school and later serving as the seat of the \\"Main School\\" (i.e., Warsaw University). In about 1863, the pavilions were rebuilt to designs by Antoni Sulimowski. In 1891-94, in the yard between the palace and the Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie gate, a library building was erected to a design by Antoni Jab≈Ço≈Ñski-Jasie≈Ñczyk and Stefan Szyller, and in 1910 a new Krakowskie Przedmie≈õcie gate was built. In 1929-31, the library building was rebuilt, and in 1930, the Auditorium Maximum building was erected to a design by Aleksander Bojemski. During World War II, the Kazimierz Palace was destroyed, along with other Warsaw University buildings. It suffered during both the 1939 defense of Warsaw and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. After the war, in 1945-54, the palace was rebuilt to a design by Piotr Biega≈Ñski. The reconstruction of the whole campus was finally completed in 1960. The Kazimierz Palace currently houses the Warsaw University rectorate, as well as the Museum of the History of Warsaw University. Since the building's revitalization in 2006 (partly with European Union funds), the building is one of the most attractive on Warsaw's Royal Route.

That enterprise involved 370 tons of weapons sold to the Croatian government by Chile on 7 December 1991, when Croatia was under a United Nations embargo arising from the war in Yugoslavia.Biographical notice on Memoria viva NGO website In January 1992, Magistrate Correa sought testimony from Huber on the deal. However, Huber may well have been silenced to avoid implicating former Chilean President and then-Commander-in-Chief of the Army Augusto Pinochet, who was himself awaiting trial on related charges.Andrea Chaparro, CDE insiste en unir caso Huber con tr√°fico de armas a Croacia, La Naci√≥n, 15 August 2005  Life  Gerardo Huber graduated from military school in 1964, specializing as an engineer.Manuel Salazar Salvo, Roto el pacto de silencio en la inteligencia militar , Punto Final, No. 611, 24 March ‚Äì 6 April 2006 Ten years later, after Augusto Pinochet's coup in 1973, he began working for the DINA intelligence agency and was sent to Argentina to infiltrate groups supporting the Chilean MIR faction in its struggle against Pinochet's dictatorship. When he returned to Chile, he worked with American-born DINA agent Michael Townley in producing chemical weapons, which were used against political dissidents. At the beginning of the 1980s, Huber was sent to the military chemical installation in Talagante. He served as governor of Talagante Province from 1987 to 1989. Colonel Huber was nominated in March 1991 to the Army's Directorate of Logistics, where he was tasked with the buying and selling of weapons abroad. According to his widow, he met with Pinochet in May 1991 to inform him of various irregularities occurring in the logistics service of the Army. Huber's widow alleges that Pinochet's reaction was to send him to a military hospital so he could see a psychiatrist.  The arms deal and Huber's death  Ives Marziale, representative of Ivi Finance & Management Incorporated, a firm directed by German Gunter Leinthauser, arrived in Chile in October 1991 in hopes of buying second-hand weapons from the Chilean Army to sell to the Croatian Army. At that time, Croatia was preparing for the defense of Bosnia ahead of a Serbian offensive to capture Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. However, the UN had imposed an arms embargo on the region to try to quell the fighting, and Croatia was thus hampered in its efforts to secure weapons and ordnance. On 19 November 1991, Marziale closed the deal with General Guillermo Letelier Skinner, a close associate of Pinochet'sEl verdadero objetivo del \\"boinazo\\" de Pinochet , Diario Siete, 25 September 2005 and head of the Chilean Famae (F√°bricas y Maestranzas del Ej√©rcito, Factories and Arsenals of the Army of Chile), the quasi-military firm in charge of producing the weapons. The agreement was worth more than US$6 million; the weaponry purchased included 370 tons of weaponry, including SG 542 firearms, Blowpipe surface-to-air missiles, Mamba anti-tank missiles, rockets, grenades, mortars, and loads of 7.62mm ammunition. The illegal arms deal was revealed in December 1991, when the weapons, disguised as \\"humanitarian aid\\" from a Chilean military hospital, were discovered in Budapest. On 7 December 1991, a Hungarian newspaper published the scoop, and on 2 January 1992, General Letelier was forced to resign. Two days later, at the request of Minister of Defence Patricio Rojas, the Chilean Supreme Court nominated Magistrate de la Cerda to investigate the arms deal. The magistrate called Gerardo Huber as a witness; Huber declared that he had been following orders from General Krumm, the logistics chief. On 29 January 1992, Huber, who was vacationing in San Alfonso, Caj√≥n del Maipo, \\"disappeared\\". His body was found on 20 February 1992, with the skull shattered.Caso Huber: Suprema rechaz√≥ recurso en favor de general (r) Provis, Radio Cooperativa, 28 March 2006  Investigations  Chilean police at first declared Huber's death to be a suicide. In 1996, Magistrate Mar√≠a Soledad Espina, in charge of investigations concerning Huber's case, categorically excluded the possibility of suicide. Despite this, the case remained dormant until Magistrate Claudio Pavez took over the case in September 2005; he subsequently found the death of Huber to be a homicide. Pavez has since accused the civilian police of obstruction of justice in relation to the investigation. On 7 March 2006, Magistrate Pavez indicted five retired high-ranking military officers on charges of conspiracy to cover up Huber's assassination. They included General Eugenio Covarrubias, head of the Direcci√≥n de Inteligencia del Ej√©rcito (DINE, or the Military Intelligence Directorate, DINA's successor) in 1992; General V√≠ctor Liz√°rraga, then Deputy- Director of DINE; General Krumm; Brigadier Manuel Provis Carrasco, then head of the Batall√≥n de Inteligencia del Ej√©rcito (BIE, or the Military Intelligence Agency); and Captain Julio Mu√±oz, a friend of Huber and former member of the BIE. General Krumm testified to Magistrate Pavez that the arms deal had been directly approved by President Pinochet. Following statements made by Captain Pedro Araya, Krumm confirmed a meeting was held prior to the deal. According to Araya, Richard Quass, director of Operations of the Army; General Florienco Tejos, chief of War Materiel; General Jaime Concha, Commandant of Military Institutions; General Guido Riquelme, Chief Commandant of the 2nd Army Division; General Guillermo Skinner; and General Krumm all attended the meeting. Captain Araya, who had been sentenced to five years in prison for his involvement in the arms deal, turned state's evidence in 2005 and declared that he had acted under orders from the military hierarchy. He also stated that Pinochet \\"had full knowledge of this sale, since he was in close communication with the director of Famae and made available on the army's part the arms that were sold by Famae.\\" Further, official documents state that money from the arms deal was funneled into Pinochet's personal bank accounts abroad. Evidence presented suggested that Famae head General Letelier may have been complicit in laundering the funds. Another witness and defendant in the case, Jorge Molina Sanhueza, testified in March 2006 that on 22 January 1992, shortly before Huber's assassination, he had a private meeting with Pinochet upon returning from a trip to Israel.News cables, Caso Huber: investigan presunta falsificaci√≥n de parte policial, La Naci√≥n, 13 March 2006 Gerardo Huber sab√≠a demasiado, pero no alcanz√≥ a contarlo. El coronel que le pena al ej√©rcito , La Naci√≥n, 25 September 2005 General Liz√°rraga, the number two man at DINE, had previously denied this meeting took place. Eventually, both General Liz√°rraga and General Covarrubias admitted to the magistrate that Pinochet personally headed the BIE, which the former dictator declared his nescience of. According to Pavez' investigations, between his \\"disappearance\\" and the discovery of his corpse, Colonel Huber had been detained in a secret military installation operated by Chilean intelligence. Pavez has suggested that Huber had been kidnapped by BIE agents and transferred to a secret detention center of the Escuela de Inteligencia del Ej√©rcito (EIE, School of Army Intelligence) in Nos, which was also the location of the Laboratorio de Guerra Bacteriol√≥gica del Ej√©rcito (Bacteriological Warfare Army Laboratory). The laboratory was headed in 1992 by General Covarrubias. Along with Manuel Provis, one of the main suspects in the Huber assassination, Covarrubias also allegedly detained DINA biochemist Eugenio Berr√≠os in September 1991 before sending him to Argentina and then Uruguay. Covarrubias was also indicted for the kidnapping and murder of Berr√≠os, who was killed in Uruguay in 1995.Caso Berr√≠os - La guerra secreta entre un esp√≠a y un abogado , El Periodista, N¬∞59, 8 April 2004 = Convictions = Investigations into the murder officially ended in July 2007.Justicia cerr√≥ la investigaci√≥n por el homicidio del coronel Gerardo Huber, Radio Cooperativa, 31 July 2007 Following their trial, on 5 October 2009 a civilian court convicted Generals Liz√°rraga and Krum and Colonels Provis and Munoz of the murder of Huber. Liz√°rraga and Provis were also convicted of conspiracy, receiving ten and eight years' imprisonment respectively. Krum was convicted of conspiracy and received 541 days imprisonment. Munoz was sentenced to 600 days in prison for murder. General Covarrubias was found not guilty of all charges. This brought to a close the proceedings against the officers, as well as others; eleven men had already been convicted and sentenced by a military court in June 2009 for their part in the arrangement of the arms deal. The identity of the actual gunman was not disclosed by the court.  Berr√≠os and Les Assassins  The Berr√≠os murder case, involving the DINA biochemist found dead in Uruguay, has been linked by investigating magistrates to the Huber case. In both cases, the DINE was involved. Like Huber, Berr√≠os probably was seen as knowing too much, as he had been implicated both in the Letelier case and in production of black cocaine and sarin gas for Pinochet. Berr√≠os escaped from Chile in 1992, assisted by a Special Unit of the DINE known as Operaci√≥n Silencio (Operation Silence). Furthermore, Main Cargo, the firm which worked with Famae to export the weapons, was owned by Marianne Cheyre Stevenson, the sister of Juan Carlos Cheyre. Stevenson also owned the restaurant Les Assassins, where Berr√≠os met with drug-dealers and former DINA agents in the early 1990s. The Cheyres are distant relatives of Juan Emilio Cheyre, Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army from 2002 to 2006.

She was a technological leap in battleship development for the French Navy, as she was the first ship in the fleet with turbine engines. However, like all battleships of her type, she was completed after the Royal Navy battleship , and as such she was outclassed before she was even commissioned. During her career Danton was sent to Great Britain to honor the coronation of George V, and later served in World War I as an escort for supply ships and troop transports, guarding them from elements of the German Navy. While en route to aid a blockade, she was torpedoed and sunk on 19 March 1917 by a German U-boat, leaving 296 men dead. The location of the wreck remained a mystery until an underwater survey team inadvertently discovered the battleship in December 2007. In February 2009, the wreck was confirmed to be Danton. The ship is in remarkably good shape for her age. Danton rests upright on the ocean floor, and most of the original equipment is reported to be intact.  Design  Danton-class design as depicted by Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 Although the s were a significant improvement from the preceding , especially with the 3,000-ton displacement increase, they were outclassed by the advent of the dreadnought well before they were completed. This, combined with other poor traits, including the great weight in coal they had to carry, made them rather unsuccessful ships, though their numerous rapid-firing guns were of some use in the Mediterranean. Danton was long overall and had a beam of and a full-load draft of . She displaced at full load and had a crew of 681 officers and enlisted men. She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines with twenty-six Belleville boilers, the first French warship to use turbines. They were rated at and provided a top speed of around . Coal storage amounted to . Dantons main battery consisted of four 305mm/45 Mod√®le 1906 guns (12-inch) mounted in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve 240mm/50 Mod√®le 1902 guns in twin turrets, three on either side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included sixteen L/65 guns and ten guns. The ship was also armed with two torpedo tubes. The ship's main belt was thick and the main battery was protected by up to of armor. The conning tower also had 300 mm thick sides.  Service  Danton underway Danton was laid down at the Arsenal de Brest in February 1906. Her launching was scheduled for May 1909, but socialist activists prevented the ship from leaving the stocks, and so the launching was delayed until on 4 July 1909. After completing fitting-out work, she was commissioned into the French Navy on 1 June 1911. A week after she was completed, she was sent to the United Kingdom in honour of the Coronation of George V in 1911. Upon her return to France, Danton was to the 1st Battleship Squadron in April 1912, along with her five sister ships. Later that year, while off Hy√®res in the Mediterranean, Danton suffered an explosion in one of her gun turrets, which killed three men and injured several others. In 1913, the squadron was joined by the two powerful dreadnoughts Courbet and Jean Bart. Danton served in World War I in the French Mediterranean Fleet. At the outbreak of the war in early August 1914, she was assigned to guard convoys bringing French soldiers from North Africa, to protect from attack by the German battlecruiser and light cruiser , which were operating in the area. At the time, she remained in the 1st Battle Squadron alongside her sister ships, under the command of Vice Admiral Chocheprat. By 16 August, the French naval commander, Admiral de Lapeyr√®re, took the bulk of the French fleet from Malta to the entrance of the Adriatic to keep the Austro-Hungarian Navy bottled up. = Sinking = Danton, commanded by Captain Delage, was torpedoed by , commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Robert Moraht, at 13:17 on 19 March 1917, south- west of Sardinia. The battleship was returning to duty from a refit in Toulon and was bound for the Greek island of Corfu to join the Allied blockade of the Strait of Otranto. Danton was carrying more men than normal, as many were crew members of other ships at Corfu, and had been zig-zagging to foil enemy submarines. The ship sank in 45 minutes; 806 men were rescued by the destroyer Massue and nearby patrol boats, but 296, including Captain Delage, went down with the ship. Massue attacked U-64 with depth charges, but the U-boat successfully evaded her attacker.  Discovery  In February 2009, it was made public that in late 2007 the wreck of the ship was discovered \\"in remarkable condition\\" during an underwater survey between Italy and Algeria for the GALSI gas pipeline. The wreck lies at , a few kilometres away from where it had been thought she sank, sitting upright with many of her gun turrets intact at a depth of over .  Footnotes   References  .

The ship was transferred to the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron in May 1918 and returned to Mudros where she remained for the rest of the war. =Postwar career= From 6 December 1918 to 2 March 1919, Condorcet represented France in the Allied squadron in Fiume that supervised the settlement of the Yugoslav question. Afterwards, the ship was assigned to the Channel Division of the French Navy. She was modernized in 1923‚Äì24 to improve her underwater protection and her four aft 75 mm guns were removed. Together with her sisters and , she was assigned to the Training Division at Toulon. Condorcet housed the torpedo and electrical schools and had a torpedo tube fitted on the port side of her quarterdeck. She was partially disarmed in 1931 and converted into an accommodation hulk; by 1939 her propellers had been removed. The famous underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau began diving while stationed aboard the ship in 1936.Cousteau, p. 251 In April 1941, the ship was towed to sea to evaluate the propellant used by the battleship during the Battle of Dakar on 24 September 1940. One gun had an explosion in the breech and the propellant for the shell was thought to be the cause. A number of shots were successfully fired from Condorcets aft turret by remote control that exonerated the propellant. The following July, the ship was modified to house the signal, radio and electrician's schools. Berthing areas were installed in the bases of four funnels, which had been removed previously, and the latest radio equipment was installed for the students to train on. Later that year, Condorcet was accidentally rammed by the submarine as she was leaving drydock. The impact punctured the ship's hull and flooded one compartment which required Condorcet to be drydocked for repairs. The ship was captured intact by the Germans when they occupied Vichy France on 27 November 1942. Unlike the bulk of the French Fleet in Toulon, Condorcet was not scuttled because she had trainees aboard. Used by the Germans as a barracks ship, she was badly damaged by Allied aircraft in August 1944 and scuttled that same month by the Germans. Some of her 240 mm guns were used by the Germans in a coastal battery on the north bank of the Gironde estuary on the Bay of Biscay in 1944. The ship was salvaged in September 1945 and listed for sale on 14 December. Condorcets breaking up was completed about 1949.

Completed in 1911, the ship often served as a flagship before the beginning of World War I three years later. Mirabeau spent the war in the Mediterranean Sea and spent most of her time blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean. She also participated in the attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence to Allied operations in Macedonia in late 1916. Mirabeau briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war in late 1918 and was deployed in the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. She ran aground in February 1919 off the coast of the Crimea and could not be refloated until some of her guns, armor and boilers were removed. After returning to France later that year, the ship was stricken from the Navy List. Mirabeau was given to a salvage company as payment for salvaging another battleship and broken up in 1922.

She displaced at normal load and had a crew of 25 officers and 831 enlisted men. While serving as a flagship, her crew numbered 31 officers and 886 enlisted men. The ship was powered by four Parsons steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam generated by twenty-six Belleville boilers. The turbines were rated at and were designed to provide a top speed of . Mirabeau slightly exceeded this figure when she reached a top speed of on her sea trials. The ship carried enough coal to give her a range of at a speed of .Jordan & Caresse, p. 119 The main battery of the Dantons consisted of four Canon de mod√®le 1906 mounted in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament consisted of a dozen Canon de mod√®le 1902 guns in twin turrets, three on each side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included sixteen Canon de mod√®le 1908 guns in casemates in the sides of the hull and eight Hotchkiss guns mounted on the superstructure. She was also armed with two submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside. The ship's waterline armor belt ranged in thickness from and the main gun turrets were protected by armor thick. The sides of the conning tower consisted of armor plates. =Wartime modifications= The four aft 75-millimeter gun positions were very prone to flooding in anything other than calm weather and were removed from the Dantons in 1915‚Äì1917; their embrasures were plated over to stop the flooding. The four 47-millimeter guns on the aft superstructure were transferred to other ships at some point during the war. Those on the forward superstructure received high-angle mounts and were repositioned to better serve as anti-aircraft guns.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 282‚Äì283 Construction and career Map of the western Mediterranean, where Mirabeau spent the majority of her peacetime career Ordered as part of the second tranche of the 1900 naval law that authorized a total of 19 battleships by 1919,Jordan & Caresse, p. 113 Mirabeau was named after Honor√© Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau, an early leader of the French Revolution.Silverstone, p. 105 Construction of the ship began on 8 May 1906Gille, p. 120 at the Arsenal de Lorient and she was laid down on 4 May 1908. Mirabeau was launched on 28 October 1909 and was completed () on 1 August 1911. Upon reaching Toulon on 15 August, the ship became the flagship of Rear Admiral () Dominique-Marie Gauchet, commander of the Mediterranean Squadron ('s) Second Division () of the First Battle Squadron ().Jordan & Caresse, pp. 116, 238 Together with four of her sisters, she participated in a large naval review by the President of France, Armand Falli√®res, off Cap Brun on 4 SeptemberCaresse, p. 125 and then the visit by the Navy Minister, Th√©ophile Delcass√© on the 8th.Jordan & Caresse, p. 238 In mid-April 1912, the First Battle Squadron hosted three British armored cruisers at Golfe-Juan as their commander, Rear-Admiral Edward Gamble unveiled monuments to King Edward VII and his mother, Queen Victoria, at Cannes. Mirabeau participated in the July maneuvers in the Western Mediterranean and the exercise simulating a blockade of Ajaccio, Corsica, in November. On 3 March 1913 the First Battle Squadron conducted gunnery training off the √éles d'Hy√®res with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, observing.Jordan & Caresse, p. 240 The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and French Tunisia in May‚ÄìJuneGille, p. 117 and the subsequent naval review conducted by the President of the Council, Raymond Poincar√©, on 7 June.Meirat, p. 5 Rear Admiral Marie-Jean-Lucien Lacaze relieved Gauchet on 16 AugustJordan & Caresse, p. 247 and Mirabeau joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October‚ÄìDecember, making port visits in Egypt, Syria, and Greece. Lacaze shifted his flag to her sister on 12 March 1914 and the ship had to briefly withdraw from the grand fleet exercises on 13 May due to engine troubles. As tensions rose during the July Crisis, Mirabeau and the other ships of the First Battle Squadron downloaded their practice ammunition and exchanged suspect lots of propellant for new ones beginning on 27 July. They recoaled four days later and the mobilized on 2 August.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 242, 247 =World War I= Before the French declared war on the German Empire on the morning of 4 August, Vice Admiral () Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, commander of the 1st Naval Army (), as the Mediterranean Squadron had been renamed in 1913, ordered most of his ships to concentrate off the Algerian coast to escort troop convoys to Metropolitan France and to blockade German shipping in the Mediterranean. Despite this deployment the German battlecruiser and light cruiser were able to bombard B√¥ne and Philippeville on 4 August. Despite Mirabeaus machinery problems which limited the 1st Battle Squadron to a speed of , the squadron probably would have intercepted the German ships later that morning if its commander, Vice Admiral Paul Chocheprat, had not ordered a turn to the west.Jordan & Caresse, p. 254 Mirabeau spent the rest of the month under repair. Aside from several uneventful sorties into the Adriatic, the French capital ships spent most of their time cruising between the neutral Greek and Italian coastsJordan & Caresse, pp. 254‚Äì257 to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic.Halpern, p. 19 The torpedoing of the dreadnought battleship on 21 December by the Austro-Hungarian submarine showed that the battleships were vulnerable to this threat, and they were withdrawn to spend the rest of the month further south at an anchorage in Navarino Bay.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 257‚Äì258 On 11 January 1915, the French were alerted that the Austro-Hungarian fleet was going to sortie from its base at Pola, so the Naval Army sailed north to the Albanian coast. It proved to be a false alarm, and they were back at their moorings three days later. In the meantime, the ships patrolled the Ionian Sea. The declaration of war on Austria-Hungary by Italy on 23 May, and the Italian decision to assume responsibility for naval operations in the Adriatic, allowed the French Navy to withdraw to either Malta or Bizerte, Tunisia, to cover the Otranto Barrage. Mirabeau was in Malta on 30 June when a torpedo exploded in a nearby warehouse. The ship was only lightly damaged, but two men of her crew were killed and eleven wounded.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 258, 260 thumb In November 1916, she transported landing parties from the other ships of her division to Athens. On 1 December, those landing parties participated in the Allied attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence to Allied operations in Macedonia. Greek resistance to the Allied action ended after Mirabeau fired four rounds from her main armament into the city, one of which landed near the Royal Palace. Afterwards, she spent 1917 based at Corfu or at Mudros to prevent Goeben, by this time transferred to the Ottoman Empire and renamed Yavuz Sultan Selim, from breaking out into the Mediterranean. In August the ship tested a tethered balloon, but it was destroyed by a lightning strike on 31 October.Jordan & Caresse, p. 276 In April 1918, Mirabeau accompanied her sisters and to Mudros where they remained for the rest of the war.Gille, p. 118 The 1st Naval Army was reorganized on 1 July and most of the Danton-class ships were assigned to the Second Squadron () with Mirabeau part of the First Division of the Squadron.Jordan & Caresse, p. 277 =Postwar= One of the ship's main guns being reinstalled in Sevastopol in 1919 After the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship participated in the early stage of the occupation of Constantinople beginning on 12 November. By 8 December Mirabeau was already deployed to the Black Sea to support White Russian forces in Sevastopol and deter Soviet forces who were advancing on the city during the Russian Civil War.Jordan & Caresse, p. 279 Mirabeau ran aground during a snowstorm on 18 February 1919 off the Crimean coast. She could not be refloated until of weight were removed. To this end, her guns, turret armour, most of her boilers, coal, ammunition and the upper strake of belt armor was disembarked. After several weeks of effort, the ship was refloated on 6 April and she was towed by the and the tugboat Thernomore to a drydock in Sevastopol to repair any damage and to have her equipment reinstalled. This process began on 12 April, but Mirabeau was refloated three days later as news was received of the Red Army's advance on the city. Only her guns, ammunition and part of her armor had been replaced by the time the city was evacuated by the Allies on 5 May. She was towed to Constantinople by the battleship and five tugs where she remained from 7‚Äì15 May. Justice then resumed the tow and they reached Toulon on the 24th. After an inspection of the ship in a drydock, Mirabeau was stricken on 22 August and turned over as compensation to the company that salvaged the pre-dreadnought battleship . Her hulk was towed to Savona, Italy, to be scrapped on 28 April 1922.Jordan & Caresse, p. 285 Notes Bibliography   Further reading *  External links  * CUIRASSE Danton Danton-class battleships Ships built in France 1909 ships ","title":"French battleship Mirabeau"},{"id":"13212987","text":"Vergniaud was one of the six semi-dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy in the late 1800s.

She briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war and was deployed in the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. The ship's crew mutinied after one of its members was killed when a protest against intervention against the Bolsheviks was bloodily suppressed. Vergniaud returned to France and was later placed in reserve after a brief deployment in the Eastern Mediterranean. She was condemned in 1921 and used as a target ship until 1926. The ship was sold for scrap two years later. Design and description Although the s were a significant improvement from the preceding , they were outclassed by the advent of the dreadnought well before they were completed.

Afterwards, Vergniaud joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October‚ÄìDecember 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914. =World War I= At the beginning of the war, the ship, together with her sister and the dreadnought , unsuccessfully searched for the German battlecruiser Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau in the Balearic Islands. She later escorted troop convoys from North Africa to France before she joined her sistersGille, pp. 118, 120 at Malta. On 16 August 1914 the combined Anglo-French Fleet under Admiral Auguste Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, including Vergniaud, made a sweep of the Adriatic Sea. The Allied ships encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , escorted by the destroyer , blockading the coast of Montenegro. There were too many ships for Zenta to escape, so she remained behind to allow Ulan to get away and was sunk by gunfire during the Battle of Antivari off the coast of Bar, Montenegro. Vergniaud was one of the ships that bombarded Cattaro on 1 September and blockaded the Strait of Otranto for the rest of the year and through August 1915. She was based at Malta and Bizerte until February 1916 when she sailed to Toulon. Vergniaud was transferred to the Second Squadron on 27 March 1916 and resumed her former duties of blockading the Strait of Otranto from bases in Argostoli and Corfu for most of the rest of the war. The ship transferred some of her men to her sister that participated in the Allied attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence to Allied operations in Macedonia in Athens on 1 December 1916. The lieutenant in charge of her landing party was killed as were several other men during the incident. She was given a short refit at Toulon from 9 November 1917 to January 1918 and returned to Corfu. Vergniaud was transferred to Mudros in May to prevent Goeben from breaking out into the Mediterranean. A boiler burst on 14 September, killing four men and wounding nine others. After the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire, the ship participated in the early stage of the occupation of Constantinople. She returned to Toulon on 17 December for a short refit.Meirat, p. 6 =Postwar career= In early 1919, Vergniaud was among the ships stationed off Sevastopol as an Allied deterrent to Soviet forces who were encroaching on the city during the Russian civil war. Despite Allied support, the city's White Russian forces were in a seemingly hopeless position, and in April 1919 the French naval high command ordered the ships to evacuate. Rejecting this, the commander of the Second Squadron, Vice-Admiral (vice-amiral) Jean-Fran√ßoise-Charles Amet, attempted to have his forces intervene in the fighting, only to have a mutiny erupt on several of his ships. War-weary sailors demanded to return home and the ensuing standoff culminated in a mass shooting of sailor demonstrators. Fifteen people were wounded, but only one died, a sailor from Vergniaud. The battleship's crew had thus far remained neutral in the conflict but quickly joined the ranks of the most radical mutineers, unfurling red banners in support of the Bolshevik forces. The four-day stalemate ended in a victory for the sailors: the ships withdrew from the Black Sea and Vergniaud returned to France. The ship departed on 29 April, towing the merchant ship to Constantinople.Meirat, p. 6 A surviving pair of 240mm/50 Mod√®le 1902 guns from the Vergniaud that were mounted on the √éle de Gor√©e in Senegal. Vergniaud was based in Beirut from May to August 1919 to monitor Turkish activities off the coasts of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. She arrived in Toulon on 6 September and was placed in special reserve on 1 October. This ship was later found to be in poor shape, decommissioned in June 1921 and condemned on 27 October. She was disarmed in 1922. Nine of her 240mm guns were installed as coastal defence batteries around the port city of Dakar, Senegal.Dumas & Pr√©voteaux p. 107 Two of the guns and their barbettes were sited on the √éle de Gor√©e; due to their prominence they have become known as the \\"Les canons de Navaronne\\" after the eponymous 1961 film The Guns of Navarone. In 1940, the port batteries forced an Allied fleet to withdraw from the Vichy French port during the Battle of Dakar. Vergniaud became a target ship and was used to evaluate the effects of poison gases and bombs until 1926. She was listed for disposal on 5 May 1927 and was sold for breaking up on 27 November 1928 for the price of 5,623,123 francs. A monument to the French mutineers of 1919 was erected by the Soviets in Sevastopol, at Morska√Øa Square where Vergniauds sailor was killed.

It included both former allies and opponents of deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his outlawed Thai Rak Thai Party (TRT). Suwit Khunkitti and Watchara Punnachet were elected party leader and party secretary general respectively. The party appointed Vatana Asavahame as the party chairman, and Police General Pracha Promnok as party chief adviser. General Pallop Pinmanee, adviser to the Internal Security Command Operation, accepted to become adviser to the party, overseeing security. Thaksin (right) with Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai (left) at Rumsfeld in Pentangon, 2005  2007 election  At the party's first caucus, Puea Pandin leader Suwit Khunkitti vowed to win more than 60 seats in Parliament and promised to implement nine policies to improve the state of the Thai economy. By 28 October 2007, the party had formed its finance and tourism team in the form of the party's Academic Council, chaired by former Deputy Prime Minister, Surakiart Sathirathai. Members included former Governor of the Bank of Thailand Vijit Supinich, former Secretary to the Ministry of Finance Supachai Pisitvanit, former Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives Bunpod Hongthong and Finance specialists Vichien Techapaiboon and Nithit Pukkanasud. Although Surakiart Sathirathai was one of 111 TRT executives banned from politics for five years, he said that the party's Academic Council only provides policy guidelines and is not part of the political party. The tourism team was led by former Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Juthamas Siriwan and former senators Suradej Yasawat and Jirayu Vasurut. All three were also deputy party leaders. Their main policy was to make Thailand a hub for tourism with expected earnings of 1.33 trillion baht in 2011. Three days before the 2007 general election, deputy party leader Juthamas Siriwan resigned from the party amidst a bribery scandal stemming from her tenure as governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand and president of the Bangkok International Film Festival.Hollywood bribery scandal takes spotlight in Thailand, with prime minister vowing justice, Associated Press via International Herald Tribune; retrieved 2007-12-25 In the election, the party won 24 seats in parliament: seven party-list candidates and 17 constituency candidates. Most of them were elected in districts in the Northeastern Region (Isan), especially in the provinces of Nakhon Ratchasima and Surin. The party became a junior partner in the government coalition led by Samak Sundaravej and his PPP. Its representation increased to 32 seats after the Constitutional Court dissolved the PPP in the 2008 political crisis and its members defected to other parties. Puea Pandin then changed its allegiance and helped to elect Abhisit Vejjajiva of the Democrat Party prime minister.  Since 2011  Many Puea Pandin's members of parliament defected to other parties ahead of the election in 2011, hoping to increase their chances of being re-elected. By the end of the 2007-2011 term, 12 of the 32 Puea Pandin MPs had joined the Bhumjaithai Party, three had defected to Pheu Thai, two to the Democrats, two to Chartthaipattana, and one each to Matubhum and Tankun Pandin. The remaining nine representatives joined forces with their Chart Pattana Party colleagues, running under the new Chart Pattana Puea Pandin Party and winning 7 of 500 seats. After conflicts between the two parties, Puea Pandin returned to contest the 2014 general election on its own, but the election was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court.

She took part in the Battle of Antivari later in August, and the seizure of Corfu in January 1916, but saw no further action during the war. After the war, the British and French intervened in the Russian Civil War; this included a major naval deployment to the Black Sea, which included Ernest Renan. She served as a training ship in the late 1920s before she was sunk as a target ship in the 1930s. Design and description Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1923 Ernest Renan was intended to be a member of the , but naval architect Emile Bertin repeatedly tinkered with the design and decided to lengthen the ship in an attempt to increase her speed.

The boilers were grouped into two sets of boiler rooms that were separated by the amidships gun turrets and their magazines and exhausted into six funnels. Ernest Renan had a designed speed of , but reached from during her sea trials. She initially carried up to of coal, although this was later reduced to , which gave her a range of at a speed of . Ernest Renans main armament consisted of four 50-caliber Canon de 194 mm Mod√®le 1902 guns mounted in twin gun turrets fore and aft. Her intermediate armament was twelve 45-caliber Canon de 164 mm Mod√®le 1893-96 guns. Eight of these were in single turrets on the forecastle deck and the other four were in casemates. For anti-torpedo boat defence she carried sixteen guns and eight Hotchkiss guns. She was also armed with two submerged torpedo tubes. During World War I, some of her lighter guns were replaced by anti-aircraft guns, but details are lacking. The waterline armored belt of Ernest Renan was thick amidships and extended from below the waterline to above it. The armor thinned to forward of the foremast and aft of the mainmast. It did not extend all the way to the stern and terminated in a bulkhead. The upper strake of armor was thick and extended to the upper deck. The curved protective deck had a thickness of along its centerline that increased to at its outer edges and over the rudder. A watertight internal cofferdam, filled with cellulose, ran the length of the ship between the upper and main decks. The main gun turrets had thick sides and roofs and the intermediate turrets were protected by sides and had roofs. The supports for the turrets ranged from in thickness for the main turrets and for the intermediate turrets. The conning tower was 203 mm thick.The armor layout is somewhat unclear; in Directory of the World's Capital Ships, Silverstone provides different figures, including an armored belt thick and thinner protection for the main turrets and intermediate turrets, at and , respectively. See Silverstone, p. 82, for further details. Construction and career Ernest Renan, named after the philosopher and philologist Ernest Renan, was built at the Chantiers de Penho√´t shipyard in Saint-Nazaire. Her keel was laid down on 21 October 1903 and she was launched on 9 April 1906.Silverstone, p. 97, gives 1 October 1903 and 9 March 1906 respectively; however the contemporary professional article differs. The linked article contains interesting photographs of the hull on the ways and after launch. Fitting-out work was completed by early 1909, and she was commissioned into the French Navy in February. After entering service, Ernest Renan was assigned to the cruiser squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, based in Toulon.Earle, p. 1113 In April 1912, she was assigned to the 1st Light Squadron, along with the two s.Ingersoll, p. 1385 =World War I= Ernest Renan steaming at high speed At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Ernest Renan and the armored cruisers and were mobilized as the First Light Division and tasked with hunting down the German battlecruiser and her consort Breslau. These ships, along with a flotilla of twelve destroyers, was to steam to Philippeville on 4 August, but the German ships had bombarded the port the previous day. This attack, coupled with reports that suggested the Germans would try to break out of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic, prompted the French high command to send Ernest Renan and the First Light Division further west, to Algiers.Corbett, pp. 61-62 After the German ships escaped to Constantinople, rather than attack the French troop transports from North Africa as had been expected, Ernest Renan joined the rest of the French fleet in its blockade of the Adriatic Sea. The fleet, commanded by Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re, had assembled by the night of 15 August; the following morning, it conducted a sweep into the Adriatic and encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser . In the ensuing Battle of Antivari, Zenta was sunk, with no losses on the French side. The French fleet then withdrew due to the threat of Austro-Hungarian U-boats in the area.Corbett, pp. 88-89 On 8 January 1916, Ernest Renan, Edgar Quinet, and embarked a contingent of Chasseurs Alpins (mountain troops) to seize the Greek island of Corfu. The cruisers sent the troops ashore on the night of 10 January; the Greek officials on the island protested the move but offered no resistance.Lauzanne, pp. 121-122 On 22 December, Ernest Renan collided with an Italian steamer, several passengers of which drowned in the accident.New York Times Index, p. 4 Ernest Renan spent the rest of the war in the Mediterranean and did not see further action. =Postwar= Shortly after the end of the war, British and French warships began to operate in the Black Sea in what became a large-scale intervention in the Russian Civil War against the Bolsheviks. Ernest Renan was among the first Allied warships to enter the area; she arrived in Novorossiysk with the British light cruiser and two torpedo boats on 23 November 1918.Chamberlin, p. 153 On 18 March 1921, the leadership of the Democratic Republic of Georgia was evacuated on board Ernest Renan to France after the Red Army invasion of Georgia.Smele, p. 147 After returning to France, the ship's mainmast was removed to allow her to tow a balloon and anti-aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the after 164 mm gun turrets.Gardiner & Gray, p. 193 Ernest Renan finished her active career as a gunnery training ship from 1927 to 1929, after which she was stricken from the naval register.Jordan & Moulin, p. 167 During her tenure in the gunnery school, she was commanded by √âmile Muselier, who went on to serve as the commander of the Free French Naval Forces during World War II.Callo & Wilson, p. 293 In 1931, the old cruiser was expended as a target ship for aircraft and naval gunners.The ship's fate is also unclear, Silverstone says that she was discarded in 1936 and sunk in 1939.

With a floor area of , it is the 32nd largest shopping centre in the United Kingdom and the largest in the surrounding area. The centre has 107 shops, a bowling alley, a cinema, a library (which opened on 3 June 2008), parking for 1,600 cars on site, and car parking other car parks available nearby. The complex is part of a major regeneration of High Wycombe in a bid to transform the town into a regional shopping destination. The complex includes a new bus station and 48 residential flats. The shopping centre opened on 13 March 2008, the bus station opening earlier in July 2006. Eden attracted one million visitors within two weeks of opening and regularly attracts over 350,000 visitors per week. History =Background= Eden formed part of a multi-million programme of investment to transform the town. In 1991, the area later occupied by Eden was known as 'the western desert', and Wycombe District Council placed improving it as a top priority. Before the construction of Eden, the town centre of High Wycombe contained two shopping centres, the Octagon Centre and the Chilterns Shopping Centre. The Octagon which opened in the 1970s was dated and was incorporated into the redevelopment. High Wycombe has a population of 120,257 people and the town centre was not much of an attraction, with shops spread out over a large area. Moreover, the town was seen as being overshadowed by nearby towns with larger shopping centres, such as the Queensmere Observatory (Slough), King Edward Court (Windsor), the Oracle (Reading), the Chimes (Uxbridge), Harlequin Shopping Centre (Watford) and Central Milton Keynes Shopping Centre (Milton Keynes). A new shopping centre was agreed to rejuvenate the town. The development was known as Western Sector, Project Phoenix and TCR (town centre redevelopment), until the name 'Eden' was announced at the annual meeting of Wycombe District Council on 9 May 2005. This name was recommended by marketing consultants DS Emotion, who had been appointed to choose an appropriate name for the development. Letters written to local newspaper Bucks Free Press revealed a mixed reaction to the name: some readers felt that it was unrelated to local culture and not inclusive for High Wycombe's ethnic community, but others approved of the name and remarked on the sense of calm it evoked. The new shopping centre would include a new bus station, library, cinema, and a bowling alley. 48 new flats would also be built. =Construction= The bid for the contract was won by Stannifer, the construction arm of Multiplex UK. Despite some initial uncertainty when it emerged that Multiplex UK was in financial difficulties related to its rebuilding project at Wembley Stadium, the construction work began in September 2005. Construction was scheduled to begin on 5 September, but there was a delay due to incomplete paperwork, and building work began properly on 30 September. Demolition work started in August, beginning with Iceland. While Eden was being built, the fencing around the site contained 'vision holes' so that visitors could see the progress being made. During construction work for the new shopping centre, car parking in the town was affected, as Bridge Street car park was closed. Some roads were also closed or partly closed. =Opening= Ferris wheel erected to celebrate the centre's opening Eden officially opened on 13 March 2008. Free rides on a large ferris wheel named the Wycombe Eye and carnival style celebrations were major parts of the opening ceremony. The actual opening ceremony involved a lone musician beginning in the high street, walking towards the new complex where he was joined by more musicians and dancers. The opening ceremony was meant to represent the town's ethnic minorities and included lightly dressed dancers. Wycombe Islamic Society criticised the dress of some performers as being inappropriate. The entertainment complex and library were officially opened on 9 July 2008 by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, who unveiled a plaque in the library. Site Eden Centre under construction (3 March 2006) The site for the new complex was to be just south of Oxford Road, a dual carriageway section of the A40 on two flat car parks. The centre would also extend over the site of the old bus station and connect to the existing Octagon Centre, which would be renamed as the Eden Centre. The Tesco store would remain in position throughout, a decision which has been criticised as the centre had to be built around the Tesco. The Tesco building is considered by some to out of place, compared to the new, modern-looking buildings. Construction of the new centre begun in October 2005 and was to take about two and a half years. As well as the new building containing the new shopping centre, a new multi- storey car park was built to connect with the existing Newlands Car Park and the old part refurbished. The new bus station was built alongside the shopping centre, with direct access to the shops from the bus station. The old bus garage was viewed as dangerous at night with little lighting so the new station was welcomed. The new bus station opened in July 2006. Centre features The centre on the first Saturday after opening The shopping centre contains 107 shops, of which 54 were new to the town and 53 resited from elsewhere in the town. The two largest stores in the centre are House of Fraser, which is four stories high, and Marks and Spencer, which moved to Eden from the Chiltern Shopping Centre. The complex has eleven restaurants and caf√©s. Additionally, the centre contains a 12-screen Cineworld Cinema, a 22-lane Hollywood Bowl alley, a 58,000-book library, up from 45,000 books held at the old library. The new library is step-free. A 18-bay bus station was constructed with a direct link to the shopping area and a cafe, and a new car park was built to extend the existing facility above the Tesco store, providing a total of 1,500 spaces. 48 new apartments were also built on the south side of the centre. Travel =Park and ride= A park and ride operates between High Wycombe Bus Station (adjoining the Eden center) and High Wycombe Coachway (part of the Handy Cross Hub) near junction 4 of the M40 motorway, which also serves the railway station and the hospital. The service began on 5 September 2005 and operates every 20 minutes during the day. =Rail= High Wycombe railway station, located near the High Street, is operated by Chiltern Railways with services to London Marylebone, Aylesbury and Birmingham Moor Street. Effect on the town centre The Eden project formed part of a larger plan of regeneration, which resulted in other developments, including the development of a new enlarged Sainsbury's store facing onto Oxford Road. In 2009, property consultants Colliers CRE conducted a survey of 15 towns and cities across the UK, which revealed that in October 2008 High Wycombe had the highest proportion of empty retail units, at 23.6 per cent. This was attributed to the joint impact of the recession and the opening of Eden, which had drawn many major retailers and shoppers out of other areas of the town. =High Street= High Street covered by snow in February 2007 The town centre of High Wycombe has gradually been moving west and the High Street is no longer the place for high-brand shops though it retains WHSmith, Boots and a McDonald's, amongst others so is still used by shoppers. The High Street and nearby streets are notable for containing the main banks like HSBC, TSB Bank, Metro Bank, Halifax and Barclays Bank and it leads the way to the railway station. Supermarket Iceland, who was forced to leave their former site on Desborough Road in 2005 as part of the Eden shopping centre redevelopment, re-opened on the High Street in 2010, occupying the space that previously housed Woolworths. =Chilterns' Shopping Centre= Chilterns' Shopping Centre was opened in the 1980s is located only a matter of feet from where Eden is now located. With the opening of the Eden Centre, there was fear that business would be pulled away from the centre, as shops such as Marks and Spencer and Wallis moved to Eden. However, the managers of the centre were more optimistic. and in October 2004 it was announced that a major store would replace the Marks and Spencer. In February 2008 the store was confirmed to be Primark, the new store opened on 1 October 2008. The centre started to become empty gradually, with Buckinghamshire New University purchasing home areas to convert into accommodation. By December 2017, only five or so units occupied the twenty-nine unit site. The site was purchased by Dandara Homes in December 2017, and in May 2018, it was confirmed that Dandara would transform the centre into flats. In March 2019, Dandara Homes confirmed that they were still interested in converting it into flats, and were looking to work alongside the council to help improve Frogmoor. =Elsewhere= The large out-of-town John Lewis near the M40 on Holmers Farm Way received some initial competition from Eden, especially House of Fraser, but store bosses were confident that John Lewis's reputation would enable it to retain customers. This has been more than borne out by the fact that in 2013 John Lewis refurbished and expanded the store to include clothing and other departments, incorporating some designer brands into their outfits. Time capsule In November 2007, a time capsule was buried underneath part of the shopping centre. Various items were placed in the capsule, which is not expected to be dug up for fifty years. Events Since August 2009, the shopping centre has held an annual food festival. The centre was used as a filming location for the Black Mirror episode, \\"The Waldo Moment\\". Public opinion Local newspaper the Bucks Free Press received many complaints about the design of the shopping centre, especially the fact that there is not a proper roof, resulting in the centre being compared to a 'wind tunnel'. This is disputable, as the designers had to work their way around the existing Tesco. However general response to the centre was positive. with the centre remaining very busy as of June 2009.

It is more common in soldiers, but also occurs in hikers, organists, people whose duties entail much standing (such as hospital doctors). March fractures most commonly occur in the second and third metatarsal bones of the foot.Hamilton Bailey's Demonstrations of Physical Signs in Clinical Surgery It is a common cause of foot pain, especially when people suddenly increase their activities.http://orthopedics.about.com/cs/lowerfx/g/march.htm  Signs and symptoms  The onset is not dramatic. When the boot or shoes are taken off, there is a cramp-like pain in the affected forefoot, and moderate local edema appears on the dorsal aspect. On moving each toe in turn, that of the involved metatarsal causes pain, and when the bone is palpated from the dorsal surface, a point of tenderness is found directly over the lesion. Radiography at this stage is negative, but the condition is diagnosed correctly by military surgeons without the aid of x-rays. In civil life, it is seldom diagnosed correctly for a week or two, when, because of lack of immobilization, there is an excessive deposit of callus (which may be palpable) around the fracture.  Diagnosis  X-ray is seldom helpful, but a CT scan and an MRI study may help in diagnosis.Emergency Orthopedics: The Extremities By Robert Rutha Simon and Steven Koenigsknecht Bone scans are positive early on. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry is also helpful to rule out comorbid osteoporosis. = Differential diagnosis = * Acute metatarsal fracture * Hallux rigidus * Jones fracture * Sesamoid stress fracture * Acute sesamoid fracture * Proximal fifth metatarsal avulsion fracture  Treatment  The first line treatment should be reduction of movements for 6 to 12 weeks. Wooden-soled shoes or a cast should be given for this purpose. In rare cases in which stress fracture occurs with a cavus foot, plantar fascia release may be appropriate.  Occurrence  Stress fractures can occur at many sites in the body; \\"march fracture\\" simply refers to a stress fracture specifically of the metatarsals, so named because the injury is sometimes sustained by soldiers during sustained periods of marching. Although march fractures can occur to the 5th metatarsal, fractures of this bone are more likely to be trauma-related fractures to the diaphysis, termed Jones fractures. In runners, march fracture occurs most often in the metatarsal neck, while in dancers it occurs in the proximal shaft. In ballet dancers, fracture mostly occurs at the base of the second metatarsal and at Lisfranc joints. This fracture always occurs following a prolonged stress or weight bearing, and the history of direct trauma is very rare. Consideration should always be given to osteoporosis and osteomalacia. Cavus feet are a risk factor for march fracture.http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/metatarsal_stress_frx  References   External links  Bone fractures Injuries of ankle and foot ","title":"March fracture"},{"id":"13213116","text":"Captology is the study of computers as persuasive technologies.https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/captology This area of inquiry explores the overlapping space between persuasion in general (influence, motivation, behavior change, etc.) and computing technology.https://www.wired.com/2000/03/fiddling-with-human-behavior/ This includes the design, research, and program analysis of interactive computing products (such as the Web, desktop software, specialized devices, etc.) created for the purpose of changing people's attitudes or behaviors.https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/1999/5/7910-persuasive- technologies/fulltext B.

Exercitiegenootschappen were propagated by Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, who translated an old book (1732) by Andrew Fletcher on arming a nation's citizens and so got the idea from Scotland. He also saw them as necessary due to the serious decline in the existing, Orangist schutterijen. Cause and context Exercitiegenootschappen were set up after the Scottish, American and Swiss examples of musket-armed citizens. The expenses of a standing army, the attracting of foreign officers into the national army and the neglect of the navy were all loudly criticised and reform was called for. The leaders of the Patriots tried to seek a solution during the Fourth Anglo- Dutch War, at the cheapest possible cost. Immediately the war (which had begun badly) developed disastrously, a wave of deprivation spreading through the country, and this result of the attempted reform was widely felt as a matter of national shame, with the harrowing contrast between the famous past and the miserable present becoming clear to everyone. Organisation and structure The first exercitiegenootschappen were set up in the beginning of 1783 in Deventer, Dordrecht or Utrecht. Quint Ondaatje was the leader of the exercitiegenootschap in Utrecht, and he soon spoke in deeds as well as words. He knew that the exercitiegenootschappen had to be organized firstly at provincial (and later at national) levels. In 1784 a number of nationally organized free-corps (vrijcorpsen) signed the Acte van Verbintenis (Act of Agreement), in which they promised to come to the aid of each other as the Patriots saw necessary. This Act especially stimulated the exercitiegenootschappen and vrijcorpsen in the small cities to confidence and action. Gerrit Paape set himself the task of being a historian of these local societies. Many people wanted to become a member, with Catholics and Mennonites no longer excluded. Not only many shopkeepers, but also ministers, such as Fran√ßois Adriaans van der Kemp, reported for duty. They exercised at least once a week, mostly on Sundays after the religious service or, in bad weather, actually inside the church. (There were almost no chairs, but a few benches for the nobility and members of the vroedschap). Members never needed to be wealthy enough to buy their own weapon, unlike in the schutterijen. Non- attendance earned a fine of a few stuivers. Exercitiegenootschappen had the preference above free corps, being completely independent of the existing schutterij. Vrijcorpsen arose mainly in the countryside, because there was no schutterij for their area. After the Rotterdam exercitiegenootschap in 1784 was forbidden, more and more so-called \\"genootschappen in de wapenhandel\\" (societies for weapons training) sprang up, as in Bolsward, and they were very progressive for their time and would speak out regularly. Escalation An incident with the Austrian emperor Joseph II about the Scheldt, known as the kettle war - for two hundred years closed off by Holland and Zeeland - led to organization of the provincial armies in January 1785. Court Lambertus of Beyma took the initiative in Friesland, causing a wave of new exercitiegenootschappen and free-corps that spring. The Provincial States reached an understanding in their regulations. In the regulations of the exercitiegenootschappen, their underlying aim of bringing the people republican principles and petitioning for and demanding their participation in choosing the composition of the city administration had never been taken up. Initial support, however, turned into a discouraging administration in the summer of 1785, with the aristocrats moving more and more towards the prince. At the beginning of August 1786 in Utrecht, the exercitiegenootschappen gathered together to commemorate the Battle of Dogger Bank, with 20,000 men marching through the city. At that meeting, a radical decision was taken: sixteen democratically chosen Patriots were appointed to the council. This was a unique event in Europe. A few weeks later Herman Willem Daendels, captain of the local exercitiegenootschap, was inspired to take action in Hattem, upon which all exercitiegenootschappen meetings and mutual support were banned in Friesland and Gelderland. Freedom of assembly had reached its limits. In May 1787 the professors and students in Franeker were forbidden from joining the local exercitiegenootschappen or militia. East of Utrecht, the State army camped; there were several shootings, but not very many were hurt. Moreover, it was a war in propaganda. In June 1787, the exercitiegenootschap of Gouda stopped princess Wilhelmina of Prussia, by the Vlist. A flying army unit under Adam Gerard Mappa occupied a number of cities in Holland, and another did the same in Friesland. They tried to take the vroedschappen into their own hands, shortly before Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick the commander of the troops of king of Prussia occupied the Republic, on 13 September. The Orange restoration became established, with its superior force of 20.000 soldiers. Stadholder William V was returned to his position. All the officers of the exercitiegenootschappen who had not already escaped to northern France were captured and condemned, if they had been involved in an occupation of the city hall or defending the cities ramparts.

It is located on HaShalom Interchange over the Ayalon Highway in Tel Aviv. Opened in 1996, was built by Polish company Mostostal WarszawaEli Barbur \\"W≈Ça≈õnie Izrael\\" the station serves one of the busiest commercial areas in Tel Aviv, as well as the HaKirya IDF base. Like in all four railway stations in Tel Aviv, the railway tracks are located between the southbound and northbound lanes of the Ayalon Highway. The station was originally built with two side platforms, separated by two tracks. On September 2, 2006 a third track was opened on the eastern side of platform 2 and the platform was widened, creating the island platform 2‚Äì3. The station building is located above the platforms and has two entrances: a primary entrance from HaShalom Road and a secondary one, a bridge connected directly to the Azrieli shopping mall. New exit-only stairways were opened in 2008, allowing to climb from the platforms directly to the southern side of HaShalom Road. This new exit considerably shortened the walking distance to the eastbound bus stops. Israel Railways is currently performing complex construction works at the station in order to improve customer services, adding a new entrance and exit directly from the southern side of HaShalom Road, and adding a parking area for two-wheeled vehicles on the bridge. The works include erecting two steel structures 6.4m high, 60m long, with an overall weight of 560 tons; they will be the base for the southern terminal floor. Electronic boards display the timetable in the station building and in the Azrieli shopping mall. Electronic boards also exist on platforms 1 and 2 and display the next two trains departing from each platform. Electrification works in the station were completed on 5 April 2020. An additional side- platform and fourth track is expected to be added to the station in the mid-2020s as part of the four-tracking project of the Ayalon Railway. Access The station has a central location in the city of Tel Aviv, adjacent to some of the most important crossroads in the city, and is also close to most parts of Givatayim. Kaplan Street stretches from the station to the west, towards the center of Tel Aviv. Begin Road passes near the station, separated from the railway track by the Azrieli Center. HaShalom Road is the continuation of Kaplan Street eastwards, and connects the station with east Tel Aviv, Givatayim, Ramat Gan and the eastern part of the Gush Dan metropolitan area. Dozens of bus lines pass along Begin Road on their way to the central bus station and many other parts of Tel Aviv and Israel. A few lines pass on HaShalom Road and stop at the station's entrances. The bus lines are served primarily by Egged and Dan, but also by Kavim, Superbus, Afikim and Nateev Express. Line 63, operated by Dan Bus Company, offers the most convenient way of getting to the city center, including Dizengoff Center and the beach promenades.

IP address and MAC address data is collected into a PostgreSQL database using SNMP, CLI, or device APIs. It allows network administrators to locate the exact switch port of any node connected to the network. Details Netdisco utilizes SNMP to fetch ARP tables from routers and MAC tables from layer 2 switches. If Cisco Discovery Protocol, Link Layer Discovery Protocol, Foundry Discovery Protocol or SynOptics Network Management Protocol is available, discovery of the network topology is mostly automatic. In case the above-mentioned protocols are not enabled (for example due to incompatibilities between the network devices or for security reasons) the topology can be defined manually. A record is maintained of the IP addresses and ports each node has used.

At that time a wave of terrorist attack struck Israel, and the situation in Israel made its way to UN discussions. Danon‚Äôs first speech took place at the Security Council‚Äôs meeting on the Situation in the Middle East. The Palestinian representative to the UN, Riyad Mansour, interrupted Danon‚Äôs speech, violating protocol. In a Security Council meeting on the same issue in April 2015, Danon accused the Palestinian representative for failing to condemn terror. Ambassador Danon has visited Israel with the Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, where they visited Israelis wounded in the recent wave of terror attacks, and met with the wife of late Richard Lakin, who was brutally stabbed in a terror attack in the capital's Armon Hanatziv neighborhood. Danon visited Israel again with US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, where they toured Israel by helicopter and were briefed on the security challenges Israel faces. During Danon‚Äôs term as Permanent Representative, the Israeli Mission marked several notable achievements including: Recognition of Yom Kippur as an Official UN holiday, Acceptance to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), ZAKA and Access Israel, both Israeli NGOs, received consultative status at the UN, an Israeli UN resolution on Agricultural Technologies for Sustainable Development was adopted by the UN General Assembly, US Secretary of State John Kerry attended an event marking 40 years since Chaim Herzog‚Äôs historic UN speech, Israel held the first ever international summit at the UN against BDS, and Ambassador Danon became the first ever Israeli representative to chair a main UN committee. The Israeli Mission also held an event in remembrance of the Jews that were persecuted in Arab countries. His time as envoy to the UN is also characterized by a strong push against the UN‚Äôs historically poor treatment of Israel. After 8 months elapsed in which the UN refused to condemn the wave of terror in Israel, including a statement by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon that it is ‚ÄúHuman Nature to react to occupation,‚Äù On June 9, both the Secretary General and the Security Council condemned terror in Israel for the first time following the Attack in the Sarona Market in Tel Aviv. In addition, Danon marked another victory when the Israeli Mission partnered with \\"Stand With Us\\" to display an exhibit about Israel, which was partially censored for its panels about Jerusalem and Zionism, was later displayed fully following pressure and diplomatic efforts by Ambassador Danon. In 2016, Danon led a delegation of 14 ambassadors from the UN to Israel. Days later, the Security Council adopted resolution 2334, which noted that Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including in Jerusalem, are a violation of international law and an obstacle to peace. Despite Israel anticipating the Obama administration to use its veto, the resolution passed. On May 31, 2017, Danon was elected as Vice President of the General Assembly as the representative of the Western states. Views on conflict with Palestinians In 2013, Danon asserted that the Likud party has no place for anyone supporting a peace agreement with the Palestinians. He is opposed to a two-state solution. He argues for extending Israeli sovereignty over the majority of the West Bank.David Horowitz, 'Danny Danon, dismally, is the true face of Netanyahu‚Äôs Israel,' Times of Israel 14 August 2015. Two year prior, in May 2011, Danon advocated that Israel annex all West Bank settlements and \\"uninhabited areas\\". He concluded that Israel would bear no responsibility to Palestinians in the West Bank, who would live in their own \\"unannexed\\" towns and that this solution would avert the \\"threat to the Jewish and democratic status of Israel by a growing Palestinian population\\". Danon has advocated for punitive attacks against Palestinian civilians and infrastructure, including a suggestion that Israel ‚Äúdelete‚Äù one neighborhood in Gaza in response for every rocket launched by Hamas.The Party Faithful, The New Yorker, January 21, 2013 In July 2014, Danon advocated cutting off all electricity and fuel supplies to Gaza to induce Hamas to request a cease-fire. Subsequently, on August 1, 2014 after the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier, Danon was quoted as saying \\"If we don't get the soldier back within a few hours we should start levelling Gaza.\\" = Political views = MK Danon called for restricting the age of viewing programs with \\"unworthy\\" content such as \\"Big Brother.\\" He also submitted a bill that proposed the establishment of a government authority which would filter online sites that contain pedophilia content and endanger state security, ultimately dealing with information security and privacy on the Web. In December 2011, he proposed that on receiving an identity card, passport, or driver's license, one must be required to sign a declaration of loyalty to the State of Israel. Danon served as chairman of the lobby in the Knesset to solve the problem of asylum seekers from Africa to Israel. On May 23, 2012, he participated in a demonstration in south Tel Aviv against ‚Äòinfiltrators‚Äô from Africa, He declared during the rally \\"The State of Israel is at war! An enemy state of infiltrators has been established within the State of Israel, and its capital - South Tel Aviv. We have to put an end to this, expel all the infiltrators before it is too late.‚Äù In November 2017, an article by Amit Segal published in the Central Edition on Channel Two alleged that Danon had employed about 100 Likud activists in the Zionist organization and in return they would support him. The Israel Police subsequently opened an investigation and in September 2018 announced that the case had been closed because of a lack of evidence.  Writing  Danon published his first book in September 2012 titled \\"Israel: the Will to Prevail.‚Äù The book analyzes the Israel-US relationship, and presents alternative approaches to the conventional wisdom on negotiating peace between Israelis and Palestinians. It also criticizes President Obama's approach to Israel.

Oaths of Allegiance are usually made on a Bible, or some other book holy to the person, such as a Koran; but the person may opt to make an affirmation in lieu of an oath. Note that this oath is not the same as the Australian Citizenship Pledge which is required to be made when being naturalized as an Australian citizen. Oath of Allegiance All members of the Australian Parliament are required to make, before taking their seat in Parliament, an oath or affirmation of allegiance before the Governor-General of Australia. The requirement to take the oath is set out in section 42 of the Australian Constitution and the wording of the oath and affirmation are set out in the Schedule to the Constitution. The oath is: The affirmation is: \\"A.B.\\" is to be substituted with the name of the person swearing or affirming, and the reference to Queen Victoria is to be substituted with the name of the current monarch of the United Kingdom, who is simultaneously the monarch of Australia. Oath of Office Upon taking office, a Governor-General designate is required to take the above Oath of Allegiance as well as a separate Oath of Office, in the presence of the Chief Justice or another Justice of the High Court. In addition to swearing the Oath of Allegiance upon becoming a member of parliament, the Prime Minister, ministers and parliamentary secretaries also recite an Oath of Office upon entering office. The wording of this oath is not prescribed within the constitution and is ultimately determined by the prime minister of the day. Traditionally, the oath has repeated the swearing of allegiance to the sovereign, although this is not required. The current Oath of Office is: Armed forces The oath taken by a member of the navy, army or air force is:DEFENCE (PERSONNEL) REGULATIONS 2002 ‚Äì SCHEDULE 2 The affirmation: Pledge of Commitment for citizenship The wording of the Oath of Allegiance taken by newly naturalising Australian citizens has changed over time. Australian nationality was created by the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, which came into effect on 26 January 1949. British subjects could become Australian citizens after one year's residence in Australia as an immigrant by registration, and there was no requirement to attend a citizenship ceremony or take an oath of allegiance. Non-British subjects, on the other hand, were required to apply for naturalization, which had stricter requirements, including a five-year residency. They were required to attend a citizenship ceremony and swear an oath of allegiance, which was: :I, A. B; swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King George the Sixth, his heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. In 1966, the Holt Government added the clause \\"renouncing all other allegiance\\" to the oath,Changes in the Australian oath of citizenship. though there was no requirement for new citizens to formally take steps under the law of their former country to renounce the previous citizenship. In 1973, the Whitlam Government ended the preferential treatment for British subjects from 1 December 1973 and inserted a reference to the \\"Queen of Australia\\",Australian Citizenship Act 1973 to become: :I, A. B., renouncing all other allegiance, swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. In 1986, the Hawke Government removed the renunciation requirement and the requirement for candidates to state their names, the wording becoming: :I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. In 1994, the Keating Government replaced the oath with a Pledge of Commitment to Australia and removed the reference to the Crown:See section 27 of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 and Schedule 1 :From this time forward, [under God,] :I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, :whose democratic beliefs I share, :whose rights and liberties I respect, and :whose laws I will uphold and obey. The prospective citizen has the option of making the pledge with or without the words \\"under God\\". There have been no changes since. =Australian Citizenship Affirmation= There is also a variant known as the Australian Citizenship Affirmation that was first recited at Galston Park in NSW on Australia Day 1999 that reads: :As an Australian citizen, :I affirm my loyalty to Australia and its people, :Whose democratic beliefs I share, :Whose rights and liberties I respect, :And whose laws I uphold and obey. The Department of Home Affairs encourages use of this affirmation by school students and members of the general public including on such occasions as Harmony Day, Refugee Week, Australian Citizenship Day (17 September) and Australia Day (26 January).https://www.sbs.com.au/news/tanya-plibersek-calls-for-australian- children-to-take-pledge-of- allegiancehttps://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/citizenship/ceremony/affirmation References Australia Government of Australia Monarchy in Australia Australian nationality law ","title":"Oath of Allegiance (Australia)"},{"id":"13213360","text":"Samuel Grossman may refer to: * Samuel S.

Life Dierckx was born and died in Berchem (Antwerp). He studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and at the higher institute of arts of Antwerp. His teachers included , the former's brother Albrecht De Vriendt and Charles Verlat. Pieter Dierckx became a member of the Antwerp art society \\"De Scalden\\". He was appointed director of the drawing academy of Temse in September 1896 and also taught drawing. He changed the way and content of the teaching and brought the school to a higher level. As an etcher and graphic designer he provided his services to clubs and societies. In 1899 he illustrated the Studentenliederboek ('Student song book') of Karel Heyndrickx and in 1910 a few children's stories for the author Lodewijk Scheltjens (1861‚Äì1946). In 1912 he took part in the design of the historic procession in Rupelmonde in honour of the 400th birthday of Mercator. During the first world war he mainly painted country scenes with titles such as Potato peelers in an old age home, A sober meal, A thatch making place, The lace maker, A clog maker, A basket maker, The small quay (1917), A burned farm, A level crossing attendant, A weaver family, The spinning wheel, Piety on the heather, etc. His main subject were landscapes, mainly of forest views. He belonged to the neo-impressionistic school, and light played an important role in his works. He also worked in the historic-Romantice genre, taking inspiration from the leading Romantic painter Henri Leys. Franz Courtens held Pieter Dierckx in high esteem. He recommended Dierckx for an important commission in the town of Lokeren: two paintings for the town hall showing historic events. The first one depicts the emperor Charles V handing over the privilege of holding a market every week to the deputies of the city in 1555. The other panel shows the foundation of the Saint Sebastian guild by Albrecht and Isabella in 1613, while issuing the privilege for holding a yearly market. These are big paintings, confirming the greatness of the school of Leys. In addition they show that Pieter Dierckx has the ability to expertly picture an historic event. In March 1919 he returned to Antwerp and started a painting studio. In 1939 he confirmed himself as a painter of historic events with the almost 5 meter wide painting of \\"Saint Willibrordus explaining the bible to the people living on the shores of the river Scheld around 700 AD\\". This painting can be admired in the church of the Holy Heart in the Lange Beeldekensstraat 18 in Antwerp. He also painted mythological scenes such as The dancing sylphides and Orpheus, the soft voiced singer of Tracia. The latter painting showed the theme of the first one in the background. He was also in demand as a portrait painter. Since 1952 the \\"Pieter Dierckx Price for Painting\\" is issued biannually at the drawing academy in Temse. In 1986 the town of Temse honoured Pieter Dierckx by naming a street after him.

Launched by David Buckland in 2001 with a series of ground-breaking artist and scientist manned expeditions to the Arctic, Cape Farewell has become an international not-for-profit programme based at the University of the Arts London: Chelsea. Cape Farewell aims to change the way people think about climate change, and to widely communicate, educate and inspire action on the need for urgent, and achievable, change. Cape Farewell engages with our greatest creative, scientific and visionary minds to work together with clean technology entrepreneurs, sociologists and universities to achieve the non-carbon society we must all aspire to. In 15 years Cape Farewell have supported over 300 artists in the research and creation of artworks. For example, Marcus Coates‚Äô 'The Sound of Others' opened the Manchester Science Festival in partnership with The Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) in 2014; Guy Martin installed Forcey's Tower, Dorset, 2014; Sabrina Mahfouz completed her poetry residency with performances at the London School of Economics and the Southbank Centre; and SWITCH showcased young climate poets in partnership with the Royal Shakespeare Company, Stratford. Cape Farewell is a partner organisation, working with major cultural institutions ‚Äì such as the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, Tidal Lagoon Swansea, Tate, Eden Project, Royal Academy, Maritime Museum and Southbank Centre - to create new and challenging artworks that explore and highlight the urgency of climate change and bring the vital conversation around environmental sustainability into the public domain. Expeditions Cape Farewell uses expeditions ‚Äì Arctic, island, urban and conceptual ‚Äì to look into the scientific, social and economic realities that lead to climate disruption. Since 2003 Cape Farewell has led eight expeditions to the Arctic, two to the Scottish Islands, and one to the Peruvian Andes, including two youth expeditions, taking creatives such as land artist Chris Drury, scientists, educators and communicators to experience the effects of climate change first hand. Discoveries found on the trips are recorded and relayed through scientific experiments, live web broadcasts, film, events, exhibitions and the overall insights of artists and educators. These expeditions resulted in an incredible and varied body of artworks, exhibitions, publications and educational resources. Each journey is a catalyst for all subsequent activity. An expedition was made in September 2008 to Disko Bay on the west coast of Greenland, in partnership with the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, The University of Southampton and British Geological Survey. Scientists onboard extended their investigations into climate whilst artists, writers, and communicators kept blogs posting their response. The crew included musicians Jarvis Cocker, Leslie Feist, Laurie Anderson, Vanessa Carlton, Robyn Hitchcock, Ryuichi Sakamoto, KT Tunstall, Martha Wainwright, Luke Bullen, and beatboxer Shlomo, comedian Marcus Brigstocke, composer Jonathan Dove, theatre makers Mojisola Adebayo, Suzan-Lori Parks, visual artists Kathy Barber, David Buckland, Sophie Calle, Jude Kelly, Mich√®le Noach, Tracey Rowledge, Julian Stair, Shiro Takatani, Chris Wainwright, architects Francesca Galeazzi, and Sunand Prasad, poet Lemn Sissay, photographer Nathan Gallagher, BBC presenter Quentin Cooper, Senior Lecturer (Open University), Joe Smith, activist David Noble, media executive Lori Majewski and film director Peter Gilbert. Oceanographers included Simon Boxall, Emily Venables and geoscientists Carol Cotterill and Dave Smith. Arts Programme From these expeditions has sprung a large body of artwork, including: * An exhibition curated with the Natural History Museum that toured to the Barbican Art Gallery, International Department. The exhibition comprised a range of media including photographic work, video, installations, and prints from a selection of leading contemporary artists including Antony Gormley, Rachel Whiteread, Alex Hartley and the novelist Ian McEwan. The exhibition was last shown in Tokyo during the G8 meetings (July 2008) where it was opened by Sarah Brown, wife of then UK prime minister Gordon Brown. * A film co-produced by the BBC Art from a Changing Arctic * A book Burning Ice * The CD ARCTIC by Max Eastley * Educational resources for GCSE Geography and Science * A UN award-winning website * Ongoing arts and events programme.

Since its inception in 1966 the group has provided volunteer workers, acted in a watchdog role and undertaken the restoration of the Groudle Glen Railway on the island, as well as supporting projects on the railway and producing a journal Manx Steam Railway News regularly. Beginnings No. 11 Maitland at St. John's Station in July 1967, the line's penultimate year of full operation. The group was originally one of two (the other being the short-lived Mannin Railway Group which was merged to form the one association within the first few months) formed in 1966 when the future of the Isle of Man Railway hung in the balance, this group provided a watchdog role over the railway until it was eventually nationalised in 1978 when the future of the remaining section from Douglas to Port Erin was assured. In 1966 however, the railway did not operate any services for the first time in its history which dates back to 1873 when the line to Peel was opened. In 1967 however the full network (save for the Foxdale Railway which had closed back in 1940) was reopened thanks to the intervention of the Marquess of Ailsa who ran services until September 1968 when the lines to Peel and Ramsey were closed for good. This was a period of concern for the Supporters' Association but the future of the line to Port Erin was assured and trains ran on this southern line in 1969 and onwards, celebrating the centenaries in 1973 and 1974 with special trains. But in 1975 and 1976 the services were curtailed between Port Erin and Castletown, then Port Erin and Ballasalla and the group became politically active in fighting for the retention of the full southern line. Following major campaigns that included the Supporters' Association heavily, trains returned to Douglas in 1977 and following nationalisation the following year the group took on more of a watchdog role, ultimately moving on to restore another railway in Groudle Glen whilst maintaining strong connections with the railway into the twenty first century. Volunteering Volunteers from the Supporters' Association repainting the crossing gates at Port St. Mary in July 1973 In its time the Supporters' Association has undertaken many supportive projects on the railway, from the basic painting and maintenance of level crossing gates (which were controversially replaced with automated barriers in 2001) to more menial matters such as the general tidying up of stations along the line, at one time their input ranged all the way up to providing volunteer operational staff such as station masters and train guards each summer during the 1970s. However, by 1978 when the railway was nationalised the role of the group decreased somewhat with volunteer-based workers causing difficulties within a government-run organisation. An ambitious attempt to fully restore a steam locomotive (No.9 Douglas, built by Beyer Peacock at their Gorton Foundry in 1896 and withdrawn from traffic in 1953) was aborted and so after much deliberation of other major projects (and having used some the intended funds to re-tube No. 11 Maitland in 1981) in 1982 the association began the ambitious restoration project of the Groudle Glen Railway which, since that time has been re-opened in its entirety and now operates at weekends and certain evenings in the summer months. The railway is owned entirely by the Supporters' Association and operated by volunteer labour. Since this time all the volunteer labour provided by the members of the group is concentrated on the railway at Groudle Glen and activities connected to the Isle of Man Railway have been predominantly fund-raising and/or provision of parts, see below. A more enlightened relationship with the management in recent times has seen something of a return to voluntary input, notably the cleaning and maintenance of the signal box at Douglas Station which has been opened to the public as part of annual transport festivals since 2010, the group have also provided voluntary chaperones to escort members of the public around the railways workshop facilities during these periods. It is hoped to expand upon these activities in the future. Projects Since the organisation's inception it has always had a pro-active role on the railway; prior to the nationalisation in 1978 they undertook tasks on the line such as the re- painting of station buildings, tending to flower beds at the stations, upkeep of the level crossing gates, etc. After the government took ownership the association took on more of watchdog role and ultimately took on their own major project in the resurrection of the Groudle Glen Railway in 1982 but recent projects on the railway have included:- No.6 Peveril Cosmetically Restored 1994 The Level Railway Station Restored February 2012 Locomotive No. 4 Loch Un-Loch Your Cash 1998 * New Injectors For Locomotive No. 11 Maitland (1981) * Cosmetic Restoration Of Locomotive No. 6 Peveril (1994) * Provision Of Water Tanks For Locomotive M.N.Ry.

St. Mary Railway Station (Commencing 2021) * Replica Running-In Board Peel Road Railway Station (Coming 2020-2021) * Further Restoration Of The Level Crossing & Halt (2020) * Further Restoration Of Four Roads Crossing (2020) * Restoration Of Ballasalla Gatekeepers' Lodge (2020-2021) The association have also been vocal in their support of the completion of the re-build of the diesel railcars which presently are in store uncompleted at Douglas station. They attend regular meetings with the relevant government department and in 2003 a preservation policy was put in place thereby securing the future of the line in a way sympathetic to its origins, ensuring that they are consulted when any major projects are considered by the railway's management. Groudle Groudle Glen Railway (2009) Since the nationalisation of the railway secured its future the main thrust of the group has been the restoration of the Groudle Glen Railway commencing in 1982 and the line continues today. Since starting the project, at which time the line had been reduced to a footpath, the line has been relaid to its full length for the first time since 1939 which was officially opened in 1992, seen the return of the original steam locomotive Sea Lion to service in 1987, the erection of various replica station buildings starting with the station canopy in 1993, and the continuing improvement of the line as one of the island's tourist attractions; this has included the added attraction of visiting steam locomotives, gala days in conjunction with Isle of Man Heritage Railways and popular off-season events such as Santa Trains and Bunny Trains each Easter weekend. In more recent times there have also been Jester Express days, promotions in connection with Father's Day and operations on New Year's Day were introduced in 2011. Additionally, Driver Experience Days are also offered where, for a fee, members of the public may spend the day on the footplate of a steam locomotive and drive trains. The railway is now a stand-alone charity and operates seasonally, whilst the volunteers of the Supporters' Association continue to maintain strong ties with the Isle of Man Railway albeit in a watchdog role, and provision of project items. The group maintains a strong working relationship with the management and attends regular meetings to ensure the development. Area Groups Wagon M.78 Built 1998 Wagon H.1 Built 2000 At the time the group was formed there was much support for the retention of the railway both on and off the island and area groups quickly sprouted up across the country, with members of the island committee regularly travelling to meetings on the mainland to provide updates, slide shows, film shows and get-togethers. Groups existed in Greater London, Manchester, Liverpool/Merseyside, Northern Ireland and the Midlands at one time or another but latterly, there was just one, the \\"Mainland Area Group\\". It was this group that were responsible for the building of two wagons for the railway. The \\"M\\" class of wagon numbered nearly 80 and were part of the Isle of Man Railway's stock of goods vehicles; by the time of nationalisation of the line in 1978 when the Isle of Man Government took responsibility, there were very few examples left in existence; one (numbered M.70) had been left to rot for many years and was resident in a siding at Santon station for many years. It was this vehicle that was used as a template for a project undertaken by the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association in 1997, resulting in the presentation to the railway of M.78. This wagon is now part of the railway's historic fleet of vehicles and bears plaques denoting its origins. Together with H.1 (the next project by the group) these two wagons now form the Troublesome Trucks for the Friends of Thomas weekend that takes place on the railway annually. The \\"H\\" class of wagon were part of the goods fleet of the Isle of Man Railway and consisted of a four-wheel two-plank construction; these had all been scrapped by the time the railway was nationalised in 1978 but in 1999 the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association took on the ambitious task of building one of these vehicles from scratch. Through a fund- raising campaign this was achieved and the wagon is now part of the rolling stock of the railing and has been numbered \\"H.1\\", being the re-used number of the first vehicle of the class, long since destroyed. This was the second project undertaken by the supporters, the first being the building of a similar vehicle M.78. By the year 2000 the area groups had dwindled down to a few members, too far scattered in location to warrant regular meetings and was disbanded. The possibility of reforming one of the area groups has been mooted in the past, primarily so a group of enthusiasts may take a more hands-on approach on the railway to further make advantage of the good working relationship that the group now has with the railway's management; a number of possible ideas have been floated and it is hoped that a group of volunteers may one day be allowed to have an active role on the railway once again, as it did in the early years of the association's existence. 2010 saw a return to volunteering when, as part of the railway's Rush Hour event over the May Holiday Weekend members manned the signal box at Douglas and provided guides for tours of the railway's workshops and running sheds for the first time in a number of years. Manx Steam Railway News Since its inception in 1966, the Supporters' Association has produced a newsletter to all its members, initially a foolscap sheet, later expanded into the journal Steam Railway News which contains news, views, historical articles and photographs. Initially this was produced on a small scale to limited circulation and took the form of a foolscap-sized newsletter but the format was changed to an A5 sized booklet early on which is the format it maintains today. The prefix \\"Manx\\" was added after national magazine adapted the magazine's original title, this change occurring in 1985. Apart from a spell in the 1980s and 1990s when it was produced and edited on the mainland, the magazine is produced entirely on the island and reaches a membership of approximately 1,000 usually four times a year but the fact that it is entirely prepared by volunteers can mean that the number of issues per annum fluctuates. Members and non-members alike may contribute articles and photographic material for reproduction within the pages of the journal. In 1992 the magazine celebrated its century (one- hundredth issue) with a colour cover, something which had only been seem three times previously, one of those being for the centenary of the railway in 1973. Since 2002 the outer covers of the magazine have been in full colour for each issue whilst internal photographs and images remain in black and white. The advent of the Supporters' Association official website in late 2008 at [www.iomsrsa.com] has meant that news can be more readily distributed but as a great number of members do not have internet access, the news is primarily still delivered via the journal, with more general articles appearing on the website, and announcements. The website also serves as an online archive documenting many historical documents from the railway's history and is expanded at regular intervals to include newly discovered documents as well as photographs and contemporary articles on its subject matter. From 2009 the quality of production of Manx Steam Railway News was also improved with a greater number of colour photographs and images in each issue, and the upgrading of paper quality which also enhances photographic reproduction.

He was born in Cincinnati and his family moved to the suburb of Wyoming in Ohio. Payne competed in the 110 and 400 meter hurdles while attending the University of Cincinnati. While at UC, Payne won multiple individual titles in Conference USA and was named Conference USA Outdoor Athlete of the Year while guiding the Bearcats to the C-USA 2004 outdoor title. He set school records for both distances and was a two time NCAA All-American in the 110m hurdles. Payne now resides in Northern Kentucky and trains in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 2007 he won the silver medal at the Pan American Games behind Dayron Robles, and the bronze medal at the 2007 World Championships, the latter in a personal best time of 13.02 seconds. This feat was especially surprising since Payne was filling in, as an alternate, for the injured American record holder, Dominique Arnold, and had only arrived in Japan from the U.S. less than 24 hours before he was to race. Payne competing at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin Payne grabbed the final qualifying spot for the Beijing Olympics at the 2008 Outdoor National Championships. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China, Payne continued his ascent in the track and field world and won a Silver Medal in the 110m hurdles in a season best time of 13.17 seconds. World record holder Dayron Robles, of Cuba, won the gold. In 2009, after sitting out most of the indoor season, Payne returned to Olympic form during the outdoor season capturing the 2009 USATF National Championship in the 110m hurdles, a feat which qualified him for the 2009 World Championships in Berlin, Germany. In a photo finish, Payne edged out fellow 2008 Olympian, 2007 World Silver Medalist, and former 110m hurdle National Champion Terrence Trammell by 0.003 of a second with a winning time of 13.115. Again, Payne surprised many by overtaking Trammell in the final steps although Trammell led coming off the final hurdle and was thought by the announcers to have won.

Its main objective is to promote cultural exchanges between the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and to spread information and ideas around the area. In 2002, the association launched Babelmed.net, which aims to be a link between people, events and cultural production in the Mediterranean and to provide independent information on a range of issues. It is run by a central editorial team in Rome and a network of 17 correspondents around the Mediterranean Basin.  Philosophy  The name \\"babelmed\\" refers to the Mediterranean \\"med\\" and its cultural diversity \\"babel\\". \\"Bab\\" is also the Arabic word for \\"door\\". Languages featured on the site are mainly French and English, and partly Arabic. Articles in the different country sections are presented in their original languages. The organisation's output emphasises the close connections between Western European countries and Muslim Mediterranean countries through history, cultural roots, and mutual fertilisation of music, literature and films, on the basis that the cultural dimensions of these broad subjects plays a key role towards improving mutual understanding and reducing tensions.  Content  Babelmed focuses on culture, broadly defined. The content of the site is divided into several sections: cultural agenda, press review, features, creations and archives. Each section is then divided into sub-sections such as Visual Arts, Performing arts, Literature, and so on. The site also contains on-line and interactive exhibitions, such as \\"Syria, in the eyes of Europe, or \\"The sense of commerce\\". Social and political issues are covered from a cultural point of view, attempting to promote cross-cultural understanding of national or local phenomena. Permanent sections deal with specific themes: Films, Books and CDs, Impressions, Travels, Cooking Chronicles, Poetry, Geoart. The content of the site is also available by country, with a research engine to help find specific articles on the site from their source. The site also carries features on the central issues of Mediterranean cultures, sorted by main themes (women, migration, war, cuisine, for example) or by geographical locations.  Editorial line  Babelmed's main goal is to provide politically-independent information on cultural issues in the Mediterranean region. It is an independent organisation that does not belong to any media group and has no link with any political, professional or religious body.

She has a personal best of 11.39 seconds in the 100 metres. She won a gold medal in the 4x100 m relay at the 2008 Summer Olympics with teammates Hanna Mari√´n, √âlodie Ou√©draogo, and Kim Gevaert in a time of 42.54 seconds, which set a new Belgian record. Sport career Borl√©e represented Belgium at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She competed at the 4x100 metres relay together with Gevaert, Mari√´n and Ou√©draogo. In their first round heat, they placed first in front of Great Britain, Brazil, and Nigeria. Their time of 42.92 seconds was the third fastest time overall out of sixteen participating nations. With this result, they qualified for the final in which they sprinted to a time of 42.54 seconds and 2nd place behind Russia but in front of Nigeria to take the silver medal, missing out on the gold medal by 0.23 seconds. However, one of the Russian runners, Yuliya Chermoshanskaya, was later found to have used two banned performance-enhancing drugs, resulting in the Russian team's disqualification, thereby promoting Belgium to the gold medal position. Borl√©e was awarded the gold medal eight years later on September 10, 2016. Borl√©e represented Belgium at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. She competed in the 200 metres event. She finished 7th in her heat with a time of 23.53 seconds. She did not qualify for the semifinals. She was the flag bearer for Belgium during the Parade of Nations. She retired after the Rio games.  Fashion career  After retiring from professional sport, Borl√©e and Olympic teammate Elodie Ouedraogo teamed up again to found the sustainable sportswear brand 4254, named after their Olympic medal-winning time. The brand won the Emerging Talent of the Year at the 2018 Belgian Fashion Awards.  Personal life  Borl√©e's brothers, twins Jonathan and Kevin (b. 1988), and Dylan (b. 1992), are also athletes. Coached by their father, Jaqcues (b. 1957), the brothers were three of the four runners representing the 4th place Belgium team in the 2016 Olympic 4x400 metres relay final.

Mercedes also unveiled at the 1951 Frankfurt Motor show a larger 3.0-litre M186 ‚Äòbig six‚Äô inline-6 to power its new flagship 300 (W186) Adenauer four-door saloon. While sharing many design features such as staggered valve arrangement and rockers running off a single overhead camshaft driven by a duplex cam-chain, the engines were of completely different design with little or no inter-changeability of parts.Six Appeal, Mercedes Enthusiast, May 2007, pp 52-58 M180 Variants = M180= The original M180 engine was rated at . It powered the W187 220 sedan, coup√©, and cabriolet (Type A and B) from 1951 to 1955, the W180 220a sedan, coup√©, and cabriolet from 1954 to 1956 and the W105 219 4-door sedan from 1956 to 1959. It also powered the MB Unimog 404s, the military all-round vehicle: It was built from 1955 until 1980. It was used as a \\"Pritsche\\", for towing light guns and carrying their crew, as ambulance, Radio vehicle, Fire vehicle, especially at airports and airbases. Other Unimogs, agricultural used, used already OM- type engines (√ñl Motor, or Diesel engine) but in the given period it was considered more cost effective to use petrol engines for the military. =M127= The W180 Ponton 220S Sedan, Coupe and Cabriolet of 1956-1959 benefited from the up-rated M180.924 which delivered . In 1958 Bosch mechanical fuel injection was added to the 2.2-litre six and the engine, now giving , was redesignated M127. The M127 was fitted to the last of the Pontons: the rare 1958 W128 220SE, of which fewer than 4000 were produced. In 1959 the first series of W111 \\"Fintail\\" 220SE and 220SEb models was introduced, with the carburetted M180 in the 220b and 220Sb and the M127 used in the 220SEb. The addition of the lower case ‚Äòb‚Äô was added to differentiate the Fintails from the earlier Pontons. In 1965 the W111/W112 sedans were superseded by the new W108/109 series 250 and 250S (apart from the W111 230/230S, produced from 1965 to 1968). The M180 was bored by , creating an bore √ó stroke of and displacement of . All models received the new 2.3 L engine. =M129= The M180's stroke was increased to produce the 2.5 L engine for the new Mercedes-Benz W108 250S and 250SE. A increase resulted in a bore √ó stroke of and displacement of , carburetted on the 250S and fuel-injected on the 250SE, designated the M129. The M129 was fitted with a mechanically controlled six-piston fuel injection pump. A change from four to seven main bearings was necessary in order smoothly to handle the resulting increase in power. A larger capacity oil pump was also specified. Connecting rods were slightly shortened, reflecting the longer stroke in a block of unchanged overall height. The redesigned cylinder heads incorporated larger ports, and the valve diameters were increased by . On the fuel injected cars a six- plunger pump replaced the previous car's two plunger pump and the injectors were repositioned to give a more direct angle towards the inlet valve heads. The engine cooling fan now had six blades instead of four and incorporated a viscous coupling which activated the fan only when engine speed exceeded 3,000 rpm or the radiator water temperature reached a preset limit. The engine of the 250 S was called M108 (for W108 chassis) and only the 250 SE engine was designated M129. =M114= In 1968 the ‚ÄòNew Generation‚Äô or /8 models were introduced, along with a change to the venerable mid-size six. The M180 engine of the 230/230S was continued in the W114 230 and 230.6, while the M180 of the 250S underwent a few changes and was renamed the M114. This was also available with Bosch D-Jetronic fuel injection, as fitted to the 250CE. =M130= In 1968 the 2.5L M129 of the 250SE was superseded by the 2.8L M130, the ultimate variant of the mid-sized six, obtained by increasing the bore by . The result was a bore √ó stroke of ; ), the maximum practical enlargement of the engine given the limitations of the block, which required deletion of water passages between the cylinders. It was used in the W108 280S and 280SE, in the W109 300SEL from December 1967 to January 1970, and in the W113 280SL. =M123= The final incarnation of the M180 line of engines was the 2.5L M123, fitted with the notorious Solex four-barrel carburator in the W123 chassis 250 produced between 1975 and 1985.

He is the second son of the Indian writer Nirad C. Chaudhuri. Chaudhuri has spent most of his adult life travelling and working in the Middle East, North Africa, South America, and Europe. He is a member of the British Academy and the Academia Europaea..Chaudhuri was ranked Number 58 on The Daily Telegraph's list of the \\"Top 100 Living Geniuses\\".[2] He is the author of several historical monographs, over thirty artist's booksK N Chaudhuri on the British Library Public Catalogue http://catalogue.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?dscnt=0&frbg;=&scp.scps;=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&tab;=local_tab&dstmp;=1418390695026&srt;=rank&ct;=search&mode;=Basic&vl;(488279563UI0)=any&dum;=true&tb;=t&indx;=1&vl;(freeText0)=chaudhuri%20k%20n&vid;=BLVU1&fn;=search and the director of twelve feature films. Early life and education Chaudhuri was born in Calcutta and spent his childhood in Kolkata and Delhi. In his early life, he was also a pianist and a general musician. He sat for the entrance examination for the University of London and studied history at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University College London, Birkbeck College, and the London School of Economics. His teachers included Arthur Llewellyn Basham, Cyril Philips, William G. Beasley, C. R. Boxer, Bernard Lewis, Eric Hobsbawm, G.J. Renier, Michael Oakeshott, and Karl Popper. In 1959, he was the first undergraduate since Bernard Lewis in 1936 to obtain First Class Honours in Final BA Examinations in History from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. Chaudhuri graduated with first-class honours in 1959 and was awarded the Derby Fellowship for Doctoral Research Studies. Chaudhuri completed his PhD in 1961, in just over two years. His dissertation was on the early history of the English East India Company. He was immediately offered a position at the University of London and became a lecturer, reader, and professor of economic history.  Academic career  Chaudhuri's first monograph The English East India Company: the Study of an Early Joint Stock Company 1600‚Äì1640, was published in 1965, and it is still regarded as one of the seminal works on the history of the East India Company since W.R. Scott published his classic three volume work in 1912. After the publication of the monograph, Chaudhuri began in 1966 a major research project on the later history of the East India Company. It was supported by a substantial research grant from UK Social Science Research Council. British economic historian Sir John Habakkuk, chairman of the SSRC, personally expressed his appreciation and support for Chaudhuri‚Äôs still-unproven research and methodology. The research grant enabled Chaudhuri to computerise the vast array of quantitative data on the Company‚Äôs transcontinental trade and shipping. The research was published by the Cambridge University Press in 1978 under the title The Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company 1660‚Äì1760. The Cambridge University Press reprinted the work in 2006. The methodology of the book was based on computerised data processing and rigorous statistical methods and systems analysis. This provided historians with a wide range of reliable statistical data on early modern trade and shipping, and Chaudhuri's conclusions point to the way early modern capitalism and business methods developed in Europe and the Indian Ocean. Economic History Net described the book as one of the most significant works in twentieth century economic history.The Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company, 1660‚Äì1760 Book Reviews In 1980, the Cambridge University Press commissioned Chaudhuri to write a two-volume work on the history of the Indian Ocean similar in scope and narrative to the work of the French historian Fernand Braudel. Chaudhuri was profoundly influenced by Braudel's approach and remained in close touch with the French historian until the latter's death in 1985. The Cambridge University Press contract led to the publication in 1985 of The Trade and Civilisation in Indian Ocean from the Rise of Islam to 1750 and Asia before Europe in 1990. Whereas Trade and Civilisation mainly follows the traditional descriptive method of a historian, Asia before Europe is a study, using mathematical set theory, of the dynamic interaction between economic life, society, and civilisation in the regions around and beyond the Indian Ocean during the period from the rise of Islam to 1750. It raises and answers the question how the identity of different Asian civilisations is established in the first place and then goes on to examine the structural features of food habits, clothing, architectural styles, and housing. The analysis of the different modes of economic production is followed by a description of the role of crop raising, pastoral nomadism, industrial activities, and the history of urbanisation for the main regions of the Indian Ocean. The book also presents a distinctive theory of comparative history. An extension of Fernand Braudel's theory of time and space, the methodology sets out precisely the logical foundation of the historical perceptions of unities and disunities, continuities, ruptures, and thresholds. The analysis of the historical evidence leads to the conclusion that Indian Ocean societies were united or separated from one another by a conscious cultural and linguistic identity. Below this surface level of awareness was a deeper structure of unities created by a common ecology, technology of economic production, traditions of government, theory of political obligations rights, and shared historical experience. The theory makes it possible to show that the name or the linguistic sign \\"Indian Ocean\\" is an arbitrary construction with a narrow range of meaning: the real Indian Ocean was an area which extended historically from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf to the sea which lies beyond Japan. The \\"axiom of choice\\" in mathematical set theory is used to show that even the great deserts of Asia can be included in the \\"set\\" Indian Ocean through the logic of dialectical opposition. = Criticism and impact = Santhi Hejeebu, of the Department of Economics at the University of Iowa, in her general critique of the Trading World of Asia and English East India Company, commented on the use of systems theory to describe the East India Company: ‚ÄúHe writes of the Company as a trading system, one in which the decision-rules employed by management can be mapped to a sequence of physical inputs and outputs, suggesting the Company operated like an engine.\\"K.N. Chaudhuri, The Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company 1660 1760, Cambridge, 1978, p. 486. She noted that the use of systems theory was unusual approach to organisational analysis,Jean Tirole. 1989. Theory of Industrial Organization. Cambridge: MIT Press. George Stigler. 1968. Organization of Industry. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. though it could still be useful to economic history, particularly when you need to understand the details of a very complex operation.K. N. Chaudhuri. 1983. \\"The Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company, 1660‚Äì1760: A review of reviews.\\" South Asia Research (London) 3 (1) (May): 10‚Äì17. p. 14 The gargantuan task of synthesising the thousands of volumes of records pertaining to the Company over the period indeed required a coherent approach embedded in a structural model of the Company's various operations. ‚ÄúThe drawback to systems theory is that it is a static model of the organization and it therefore offers no guidance on how to ask the deeper questions about efficiency or organizational change. Writes Chaudhuri, 'For a model cannot without destroying itself take account of the passage of time which affects its structural boundaries and parameters'.K. N. Chaudhuri. 1983. \\"The Trading World of Asia and the English East India Company, 1660‚Äì1760: A review of reviews.\\" South Asia Research (London) 3 (1) (May): 10‚Äì17. p. 41 Theories of institutional change are of fundamental concern and those that are not amenable to changes over time appear to have little explanatory power. Thus while useful as an organising heuristic, systems analysis seems rather unlikely to yield insights regarding organizational change.‚Äù Clive Dewey noted that the Trading World of Asia \\"represented the work of a lifetime, not only‚Äîor even mainly‚Äîin the sense that it took a significant proportion of [the author's] working life to write, but in the sense that such a book is only likely to be written once in a lifetime.\\" Ten productive years of archival work (involving English, French, Dutch, and Belgian sources) went into the production of Trading World of Asia.C.J. Dewey, Review in Times Literary Supplement, 23 July 1980. Dewey goes on to write, ‚ÄúThe book influenced numerous literatures within economics and history. Chaudhuri's emphasis on the efficiency of the East India Company resonates in the literature on the origins of the multinational organization and on the character of the English chartered companies. While Chaudhuri used systems theory, others (Anderson et al. 1983 and Carlos and Nicholas, 1988) have employed transactions cost analysis, agency theory, and Chandlerian analysis of firm structure to argue that the East India Company was an organizational innovation on par with a modern multinational firm such as General Motors.Gary Anderson, Robert McCormick and Robert Tollison. 1983. \\"The Economic Organization of the English East India Company,\\" Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization. 4 (4): 221‚Äì238.

They emphasize the efficacy of the firm's internal operations as its main commercial legacy. They de- emphasize the firm's imperial legacy. Other studies by contrast have highlighted the significance of \\"merchant empires\\" to European expansion. These works have also drawn on Chaudhuri's insights.\\" On Asia before Europe, Sugata Bose, Gardiner Professor of History at Harvard University, wrote: ‚ÄúYet it remains an open question whether the recourse to mathematical precision fares much better than a historian‚Äôs intuitive presumptions in resolving the problem of the spatial limits of an interregional arena of human interaction.‚ÄùSugata Bose, Hundred Horizons, The Indian Ocean in the age of Global Empire, Harvard University Press, 2006, p.,11. In 1991, Chaudhuri was invited to become the first Vasco da Gama Professor of the History of European Expansion at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy, with the support of the Portuguese National Commission for Maritime Discoveries.O tempo lento do Indico, Interview between K.N. Chaudhuri and Rui Rocha, Expresso, Revista, Lisbon, Saturday, 3 August 1991 and \\"Indian History and the Indian Ocean (Professor K. N. Chaudhuri Interviewed by Ranabir Chakrabarti).\\" Calcutta Historical Journal. 14 (1‚Äì2) (July 1989 ‚Äì June 1990): 78‚Äì83. Chaudhuri completed his contract in 1999 and has returned to his earlier activities as a creative writer and an artist. Chaudhuri was elected to the British Academy (1990), the Royal Historical Society (1993), and Academia Europaea (1994). The Portuguese government and National Commission for Discoveries awarded him the Don John de Castro Prize in International History (1994).  Later literary and artistic works  In 1994, Kirti Chaudhuri founded Gallery Schifanoia and its associated imprint house Schifanoia Firenze to exhibit, print, and publish his artistic and literary works along with the works of other artists and writers. The chance purchase of two rare books, the facsimile edition of the Calligraphic Models of Ludovico Degli Arrighi surnamed Vicento (1525) and the Socratic dialogue Crito by Plato, hand printed by Hans Mardersteig in Montagnola in 1926, led Chaudhuri to the idea of founding a printing and publishing enterprise similar to Mardersteig‚Äôs Officina Bodoni, which was later transferred to Verona and joined to the letter-press printing house Stamperia Valdonega. The press has published thirty titles so far and further projects are being planned for future publication. The activities of Schifanoia Firenze as a private press and a publishing house belong to the same genre and the tradition created by Ambroise Vollard at the beginning of the twentieth century, a tradition that was actively taken up by other art dealers and art publishers such as Daniel Henry Kahnweiler, Albert Skira, T√©riade, and Fabiani. Schifanoia Firenze has tried to maintain the standards of bookwork set by Gutenberg, Nicholas Jensen, Aldus, Claude Garamond, Bodoni, and modern designers such as Jan Tschischold, Hans Mardersteig, Bruce Rogers, and Frederick Warde. The search for fine printing paper led Chaudhuri to the high narrow valley of Pescia in Tuscany where fifteenth-century methods are still being followed in the paper mill of Cartiere Enrico Magnani. The exquisite Japanese Kozo bark paper and the Gampi vellum are used for special reserve copies, which are bound by famous designer binders in full Morocco leather. Some of these examples can be seen at the National Art Library, Victoria; the Albert Museum in London; and in the British Library. Chaudhuri‚Äôs graphic work, large prints and photographic images, have been exhibited in Florence, London, and Paris. His artistic work took a new direction with an audio play, Four Nights in Tunis. He wrote and directed the production of the compact disk in June 2007 and it is part of an audio book. The audio play was recorded at the professional sound studio A1 Vox and mastered at Iguana Music Studio, London. The parts were played by Beverley Beer and Andy Rowe. Chaudhuri was the narrator. From 2008 Chaudhuri became actively involved in the direction and production of films and created a completely new genre, a mixture of semiotic films, narration, and fictional documentary. The first film which he directed, produced, and wrote the screen play was released in 2009 under the title The Downfall and the Redemption of Dr John Faustino. This was followed by a two part series entitled In Santuario del Milagro with Jaguar of Chaco as the first part and Dolor de Rosita Valdez as the second. Then came a trilogy in 2011, Night Blooming Flower of the Poison Thicket. In 2013, Chaudhuri produced the trilogy Double Insanity Nostos Algos? Nostalgia?, Guilt from a Night of the Full Moon, and Dr Johannes von Faust. The cinematic and audio creations were produced two by the production studios Schifanoia Films and Centre Polyphony.

Better known as simply \\"Metro,\\" the authority provides transit services to the metropolitan area in and around Washington, D.C. The authority has a fleet of 1,500 buses, including 74 hybrid electric buses and Metro plans to have nearly 500 more hybrid-electric buses by 2012. Vice Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, who last year committed to convert the entire Maryland Transit Administration bus fleet to hybrid- electric buses by 2014. Maryland has already accelerated its purchase of hybrid-electric buses with the help of Recovery Act funds (Clean Cities). The logos for the Tennessee Clean Cities Programs, as well as some other logos for projects or initiatives that these coalitions operate.  Tennessee Clean Fuels  The state of Tennessee has two designated Clean Cities coalitions: the East Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition and the Middle-West Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition. They sometimes operate under the shared name \\"Tennessee Clean Fuels\\". Both were designated in 2004, and collectively serve the entire state. Many fleets in Tennessee use alternative fuels like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park; cities like Knoxville, Nashville, Sevierville and Kingsport; Oak Ridge National Laboratory; utilities and airports; mass transit agencies; and large international companies like UPS and Waste Management. As of early 2020, Tennessee has about 70 public E-85 stations, 13 large public CNG stations, 19 public propane sites, and over 390 EV charging locations. The East Tennessee coalition - ETCleanFuels - has started numerous projects and initiatives over the years. Here are a few examples: * The Fuels Fix is website and monthly email service that is \\"Clean Cities stories and alternative fuel news.\\" Each month, other Clean Cities coalitions from around the country provide articles and then those articles are sent to email subscribers. * The I-75 Green Corridor Project was a project that ETCleanFuels led from 2009-2015 that installed 40 biofuel pumps along I-75 to build it into \\"the longest biofuels corridor on the planet.\\" Both ethanol E-85 and biodiesel B-20 pumps were installed during the project. * Tennessee Green Fleets is a fleet certification program that offers fleets or any type that are reducing their petroleum use and increasingly using alternative fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions a way to get recognized for their efforts. Fleets have to meet criteria and submit data to get certified. * Drive Electric Tennessee, or DriveElectricTN, is a statewide program that is a collaboration of many partners in Tennessee including Tennessee Valley Authority, the TDEC Office of Energy Programs, and many other stakeholders. The partnership has developed an \\"EV Roadmap\\" for the state and as of 2020 is building out working groups that will tackle issues like awareness, infrastructure, policies and programs, and innovation to help drive electric vehicle (EV) adoption across the state.  Wisconsin  The state of Wisconsin has one Clean City coalition designated in 1994 called Wisconsin Clean Cities. Serving the entire state of Wisconsin, WCC has provided education and outreach regarding alternative fuels, vehicles, infrastructure, fuel efficiency improvements and idle reduction. WCC has been instrumental in securing federal and state funding to implement many projects across the state of Wisconsin. Since 2010 WCC has participated in hundreds of events and public engagements statewide. In 2013, WCC reported a reduction of nearly 12 million in gasoline gallon equivalents due to the increase of alternative fuels and technologies. WCC also reported a greenhouse gas emission reduction at 57.9 tons in 2012, a 99% increase from the previous year.  Empire Clean Cities  Empire Clean Cities is the Clean Cities coalition for New York City & the Lower Hudson Valley (Westchester, Rockland, & Putnam Counties). ECC was incorporated in 2007 and was formerly known as New York City & Lower Hudson Valley Clean Cities. ECC has been tasked with providing support and management skills necessary to advance the region's economic, environmental, and energy security by building local public-private partnerships towards promoting the use of technologies and practices that reduce petroleum consumption. In 2012 ECC introduced Empire Green Fleets a metric used to evaluate the overall impact of public and private fleets operating in the region. ECC also launched a Green Food Trucks initiative in 2012. With the popularity of food trucks in NYC growing ECC conducted an investigation on the feasibility of promoting the use of biodiesel in these trucks.  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  On 2009 Earth Day, Vice President Joe Biden announced the availability of $300 million in funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for state and local governments and transit authorities to expand the nation's fleet of clean, sustainable vehicles and the fueling infrastructure necessary to support them. The Clean Cities Alternative Fuel and Advanced Technology Vehicles Pilot Program supported 25 cost-share projects involving alternative fuels or advanced vehicles in collaboration with 50 Clean Cities coalitions and 700 stakeholders who provided an additional $500 million in matching funds. Eligible technologies included a number of different light- and heavy-duty vehicles, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid electric, hydraulic hybrid, electric, fuel cell, and compressed natural gas vehicles. In addition, projects supported refueling infrastructure for alternative fuels, including biofuels and natural gas. Other efforts eligible for funds included public awareness campaigns and training programs on alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles and infrastructure. The program required a 50% cost share from participants.DOE Offers $300 Million in Recovery Act Funds for Clean Cities Program. Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy News, April 29, 2009 These projects established 1,380 alternative fueling stations and put more than 9,000 alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles on the road while supporting U.S. energy independence and contributing to regional economic development. The Clean Cities Coalition Network compiled a report, Designing a Successful Transportation Project: Lessons Learned from the Clean Cities American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Projects, summarizing high-level project design and administrative considerations for conducting a successful transportation project. The Southeast Propane Autogas Development Program is the largest Clean Cities alternative fuel vehicle conversion deployment program in history. The Program is administered by Virginia Clean Cities at James Madison University and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy. The Program is converting fleet vehicles from gasoline to autogas in the Southeastern United States. The project received an $8.6 million grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Criticism  In 2009, the California Cars Initiative stated that the Clean Cities American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Project Awards included a scattering of funding for electrification and charging stations, but most of it was for carbon-based liquid fuels or non-pluggable hybrids.The Ultimate Posting on Plug-In Hybrid Developments: Clip & Save. CalCars, September 22, 2009 Clean Cities federal funding in 2010-2011 was set up with a majority of the funding favoring plug- in EVs and HEVs. However, the amount of funding and focus of that funding ebbs and flows between the alternative fuels over time due to advances in technology and interest in those fuels. CNG and propane were more popular in the early 2000s, the biofuels ethanol and biodiesel took center stage in the mid-2000s. The U.S. Department of Energy has awarded nearly $460 million through its funding opportunities for hundreds of projects across the country to implement alternative fuels and energy-efficient vehicle technologies. These awards leveraged almost $1.2 billion more in matching funds and in-kind contributions from the private and public sector. These project awards contribute to advancing affordable, domestic transportation fuels and fuel- saving technologies and practices. Funded projects have included: * Understanding transportation electrification in public and private fleets. * Integrating alternative fuel vehicles and refueling infrastructure in urban and rural communities. * Implementing living lab projects that demonstrate and assess new mobility solutions that maximize the return on investment to mobility systems in terms of time, cost, energy, and opportunity. * Developing fueling and charging stations along busy transportation corridors. * Providing resiliency planning through diversified vehicle and fueling options. * Securing real-world data on total cost of ownership for alternative fuels.

Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Bob McKimson. The cartoon was released on April 6, 1946, and stars Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. Daffy is the notorious \\"moustache fiend\\", bent on putting a mustache on every lip in sight, while Porky is a police officer intent on capturing Daffy. This cartoon is the first full-length cartoon that animator Robert McKimson directed. Mel Blanc provided the voices for the characters, and Warren Foster was the writer. Plot A narrator intones that in a large eastern city, the residents are terrified and the police baffled - all because someone has been painting moustaches on all the advertisements in sight; even people are victims to having mustaches painted on them. As the narrator states the suspect could be anyone (\\"It could be you! It could be me!\\"), Daffy Duck eventually confesses to being the guilty party to the audience. Porky Pig, as a police officer, is set as a \\"booby trap\\"--he's holding up a picture frame around his own face. Daffy manages to draw a mustache on Porky's face and run off, and Porky gives chase. Daffy runs off to a subway platform, where he cleverly paints mustaches on the commuters. He then tricks Porky into getting on the arriving train and escapes (not before giving Porky another mustache). Later on Porky, having come across more of Daffy's work, sees Daffy, a rope around his waist, painting a mustache on a giant billboard face. Porky gives chase and gets up to the billboard as Daffy is singing \\"She Was an Acrobat's Daughter\\" while still swinging from the rope. Porky clubs Daffy in the head, and Daffy wanders to the edge. He jumps and seemingly falls to his death, but in fact stops on the ledge around the roof and paints a mustache on Porky. Porky, muttering to the audience \\"I hate that duck!\\", chases Daffy around the ledge. The chase continues with Daffy on a motor bike and ends back on the roof, where both of them crash through a skylight, leaving Porky with a literal handlebar moustache amid the wreckage. Porky chases Daffy through the building, where the duck cleverly gives him more mustaches. Porky finally spots Daffy inside a mail chute and races downstairs to pull him out. Daffy arrives and slaps handcuffs on himself and Porky upon accusing the latter of \\"robbing a mailbox.\\" While still handcuffed, Daffy places one more mustache on Porky and laughs, but this time, the tables are turned and he is clubbed by Porky. Daffy ends up in court and pleads to the bulldog judge for mercy and to not send him to \\"Sing-Sing-Sing... Sing.\\" When the jury (all composed of moustached Jerry Colonnas) finds Daffy not guilty, Daffy swears never again to draw another mustache; instead, he declares he'll paint beards. He then laughs as he paints a beard on the judge and paints over the screen until it's all black. Availability Currently, the cartoon is available on at least two VHS tapes: \\"Porky!\\" and also \\"Porky Pig & Daffy Duck Cartoon Festival featuring Tick Tock Tuckered\\". It also included as a bonus feature of the DVD My Reputation, starring Barbara Stanwyck.

It has been dubbed the \\"Little Isabella\\" owing to its alleged resemblance to the Laxey Wheel in nearby Laxey which was opened in 1854 by Lady Isabella, the wife of the then Lieutenant Governor of the island. In its time the wheel has been used for various purposes, including pumping water to the Groudle Hotel (designed by Hugh Ballie-Scott) and providing power for the fairy lights that ran through the glen from the entrance to Lhen Coan, the terminus of the Groudle Glen Railway. Latterly its function has become entirely aesthetic. The wheel house was rebuilt in 1954 when the glen was enjoying something of a renaissance as a tourist attraction, and rumors abounded at this time that the wheel house was haunted. The wheel was featured, in a disguised form, in a 1986 episode of the BBC series Lovejoy, in a story that led to buried treasure being discovered in one of the paddles. In 1994 the wheel was refurbished by Laxey Towing Co. Ltd. and re-opened to the fanfare music of Onchan Silver Band.

He played for the St. Louis Cardinals, and Pittsburgh Pirates. Born in Chicago, he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1938 and got his nickname from a poem a fan wrote after he hit a home run in the minors. He was very briefly with the 1941 Houston Buffaloes of the Class A1 Texas League, who won 103 games. He earned cups of coffee in the majors with the Cards in 1941 and 1942 and then returned to the club from 1946 to 1951. He mostly played outfield for them, with some games at second base and third base. On July 7, 1946, he hit a game-winning, three-run home run to beat the Brooklyn Dodgers and to move his club within a half game of the National League lead. The Cardinals went on to win the World Series, and Dusak played in 4 Series games, getting 4 at-bats and hitting a double in Game 2. Dusak saw his most big league action in 1947, hitting .284 in 111 games. He drew walks well, with a lifetime .334 on-base percentage that was 91 points higher than his batting average. When his batting average dropped, he turned to pitching for a while (appearing in 23 games), but ended up his career primarily as a position player with the Pittsburgh Pirates. After retiring in 1952, Dusak was an insurance agent for 21 years and worked in a bowling alley for a decade. He died in Glendale Heights, Illinois, aged 74.

Emerging from the remnants of punk bands ( Security Risk ), mod revival groups like The Merton Parkas and the VIPs, their original lineup included Phil Ward, Tony Conway, Andy Godfrey, Guy Morley, Paul Shurey, and Simon Smith. Debuting with two tracks - \\"Just Like a Dream\\" and \\"Plastic Flowers\\" - on the A Splash of Colour compilation, the group found itself caught up in the forefront of the short-lived British new psychedelic revival. Signing to EMI, Mood Six issued their first official single written by Tony Conway, \\"Hanging Around\\", but parted from the label when the release of the follow-up, \\"She's Too Far (Out),\\" was bizarrely aborted, leaving only white label versions in circulation. 80's artist Toni Basil chose to record her own version of \\"Hanging Around\\" and this is included as the B-side to her massive selling \\"Hey Mickey\\" single. It was also included on her hit album \\" Word of Mouth\\". In 1985, Mood Six resurfaced on the Psycho label with the LP The Difference Is.... After this was well received, especially in Europe, in 1986 they signed to Cherry Red to issue A Matter Of!, which was also released to great acclaim in the USA. They guested in the award-winning music video to the Moody Blues' single \\"Your Wildest Dreams\\", playing a younger version of the band. After a long period of seeming inactivity, the band returned in 1993, releasing And This Is It on their own Lost Recording Company label. Two compilations were later released on Cherry Red, \\"Songs from the Lost Boutique\\" and \\"Cutting Edge Retro\\". In 2016, they had two tracks, 'Plastic Flowers' and 'Just Like a Dream' on Cherry Red's compilation 'Another Splash of Colour'. They reformed in the summer of 2016 to play a gig in London.

Originally billed as \\"The Fern Land Of Mona!\\", the glen was further improved in the late 19th century by the planting of many different types of tree. Whereas most glens are formed naturally, it was a conscious effort by the owners to provide part of the attraction to the Victorian visitor by being able to inspect a wide variety of trees, something which is still evident today. At the beach there were bowling and croquet greens, a mill, crofters' cottages and a bridge accessing the Howstrake Holiday Camp which was on the adjacent headland. At the point where the pack-horse road (now a footpath) crosses the railway line there is an old lime kiln from which the intermediate railway station also takes its name. \\"Little Isabella\\" water wheel About 60 yards below the \\"Little Isabella\\" wheel, still visible, is the ruin of the base of the refreshment kiosk, just across the stream by the old bandstand,(rebuilt on the site,but much smaller). In the 1920s this kiosk was run by Mona May Cannell (n√©e Grose, in those days), of Laxey old village; she travelled to and from Laxey via the tram from South Cape each day. At the outer reaches of the glen a small cove was dammed off and a zoo built featuring sea lions and polar bears in 1893 and the remains of this remarkable construction remain in situ today as a testament to the incredible feat of engineering. To serve the zoo, in 1896 the Groudle Glen Railway was constructed over a three-quarter-mile length from the depths of the glen onto the headland. This resulted in the outer station being named \\"Sea Lion Rocks\\", a name it still carries today. Described since as the \\"Alton Towers of its day\\", the glen featured many attractions for the discerning Victorian visitor, from a dance floor and bandstand, to fortune tellers, many stalls, a playground, water wheel (known as the \\"Little Isabella\\", a reference to the world-famous Laxey Wheel which is a short distance away) and the narrow gauge railway. As trends changed, so did the fortunes of the glen and it never really recovered after World War II, with the railway being the sole surviving attraction. The line closed in 1962 and the glen returned to a tranquil footpath for the next twenty years, at which point the railway was restored by volunteers. Groudle Glen Railway The glen itself runs from the Whitebridge in Onchan to the sea at Port Groudle and is still open to the public today, although the majority of the attractions, save for the restored railway, have all but disappeared. The water wheel is extant and the old dance floor was replaced in 1993 with a new bandstand structure. The glen has the only natural canyon on the island, the \\"Lhen Coan\\", which is Manx Gaelic for \\"Lonely Valley\\" (sometimes rendered inaccurately as \\"Lovely Glen\\", \\"Lonely Glen\\", Lovely Valley\\" etc.). In the lower (seaward) section of the glen, which is now in private ownership, were lily ponds that the accessed by the public by a series of winding boarded walkways. Having fallen into disrepair for many years the ponds were substantially refurbished by the Manx Heritage Trust in 1986 which was deemed to be \\"Heritage Year\\" on the island, but since this time the maintenance has not been kept up and the ponds are not easily accessible. The railway still operates in the summer months and now has a visitors centre nearby to the old zoo with tea rooms.

PBC was designed to give healthcare staff, usually general medical practitioners (GPs), the resources and support to become directly involved in decisions on commissioning health services. Policymakers wanted PBC to lead to high-quality services for patients in local and convenient settings. The incentive for GP involvement was that their practices could retain a proportion of any savings they made to invest in their own practices. In this respect, it was seen as a new Labour policy successor to the early 1990s Conservative policy of GP fundholding. Lord Warner, former Labour Minister of State for Health, described the benefits of PBC as: \\"If there is an alternative that is better for the patient and better for the NHS, then practice-based commissioning provides the basis on which they can change the way that services are delivered.\\" The government intended GP practices to be supported by the PCTs (primary care trusts) to buy in (\\"commission\\") services for their patients based on cost and quality of care. This process was expected to generate financial savings of which 7/10ths may be retained by the practice for further investment while the remainder is passed back to the PCT. Two years after the initiative was introduced, both doctors and primary care trusts were struggling to understand how to implement the scheme. By 2010, GP practices were forming coalitions known as consortia, in order to commission services at the necessary scale and efficiency. While this process was initially voluntary, eventually practices were ordered to become part of commissioning groups as part of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.

He is also a philanthropist and an author in the subjects of financial reporting, financial history, and political economy. Fridson has been referred to as the \\"dean of high yield debt.\\"Moyer, Stephen G.: \\"Distressed Debt Analysis\\", page 6. J. Ross Publishing, 2004 He is currently Chief Investment Officer of Lehmann, Livian, Fridson Advisors LLC, an investment firm based in New York , and publisher of Income Securities Investor newsletter. He lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side with his wife, Elaine Sisman. Education Fridson earned a B.A. cum laude in History from Harvard University in 1974, and as a result of gaining entrepreneurial work experience with Southwestern Advantage selling books door-to-door during college, was able to attend Harvard Business School the following semester, eventually graduating in 1976 with an MBA. He was also awarded the Chartered Financial Analyst designation in 1982. Career Fridson interviewed with Mitchell Hutchins and accepted a position as an electric utility bond trader in 1976. After Mitchell Hutchins was acquired by Paine Webber in 1977 he left with his trading group to Scandinavian Securities where he worked ultimately as an assistant vice president. In 1980 he went to Paine Webber's Jackon Curtis arm as a vice president in credit research and fixed income investment strategy. In 1981 he joined Salomon Brothers as a Vice President focusing primarily in credit research continuing to take a high interest in the high yield debt world. At this time, high yield debt came into the sights of institutional investors as a portfolio enhancing investment and there was a great demand for quality research in the field. According to Fridson, much of the high yield analysis at the time was indistinguishable from advocacy. Realizing the opportunity for this kind of research he left for Morgan Stanley in 1984, where he began to challenge market lore and accepted practices by using statistical and econometric techniques, leading to many active trading strategies. Here he became a principal before leaving for Merrill Lynch in 1989, where he was Director of High Yield Strategy until 2002. His contributions to the field of high yield debt at Merrill came from applying econometric techniques to active portfolio management strategies. While at Merrill he also documented a definitive history of the high yield debt market, which as Fridson says, \\"was shrouded in myth.\\"Fridson, Martin S.\\"High Yield Bonds\\" Probus Professional, 1989 In 2002, he left Merrill to found his own firm, FridsonVision LLC. In May 2008, Fridson sold Leverage World and Distressed Debt Investor, the two primary research products of FridsonVision, and became the CEO of Fridson Investment Advisors, an investment management company focusing on corporate credit opportunities. Following that firm's acquisition by BNP Paribas, he served as Global Credit Strategist in the bank's asset management subsidiary. In August 2012 he resumed operations under the FridsonVision LLC banner. Fridson has also been a consultant to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors since the Clinton Administration. He has been a guest lecturer at the graduate business schools of Babson College, Columbia University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, Fordham University, Georgetown University, Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, University of Notre Dame, Rutgers University and the Wharton School of Business, as well as the Amsterdam Institute of Finance.

History  = Predecessors = Yugoslavia has a long history of precision display flying which was first demonstrated to the public during an airshow at Zemun ‚Äì Belgrade's military airfield ‚Äì in June 1938. After World War II, a pair of SFR Yugoslav Air Force Jungmeisters made regular appearances at air displays in the late 1940s. These were followed by team of three Yakovlev Yak-3s, a five- plane grouping of the Ikarus S-49Cs (redesigned IK-3s) and in the late 1950s, the Air Force's first jet display team, flying F-84G Thunderjets. A new team formed by the 204th Fighter Aviation Regiment based at Batajnica (the unit's Canadair Mk 4 Sabers being responsible for the defense of Belgrade) flew over a crowd of 200.000 spectators attending the 1960 Belgrade Air show held at Zemun. This team lasted for five years until a four‚Äìship group using the indigenous G-2 Galeb basic jet trainer that performed for the first time at Ljubljana in July 1968, replaced it. The Galeb was replaced by single‚Äìseat light attack variant of the G‚Äì2, the J-21 Jastreb which was flown until 1979. In that year a pair of Czech Zlin Z-526 trainers, flown by Yugoslav Air Force instructors, took over and became the first postwar YAF demonstration team to an overseas invent, the Venice International air show in 1979 = The Flying stars = By 1985 the team had reverted to flying six IJ-21 Jastreb, and the following year it was officially named the Flying stars, nicknamed Kanarinci (Canarys). Over the next five years, the distinctive red, white, blue and yellow Jastrebs of the Flying Stars became a familiar sight at air show throughout Yugoslavia. They were replicated in 1990 by the G-4 Super Galeb advanced jet trainer and light attack aircraft which had made its debut in the West at the 1983 Paris air show. However, almost exactly a year after their first public appearance, at the 1990 Batajnica airshow ‚Äì and just before they were to make their international debut in Italy ‚Äì the Flying Stars were grounded by the outbreak of hostilities in Slovenia at 1991. During the years of isolation and sanctions, the team's Super Galebs were used for advanced training by the Air Force, although some the retained their red, white and blue color schemes. Once the decision to reform the Flying stars had been made at the October 9, 1996, Major General Blagoje Grahovac, Commander of the Aviation Corps, gave the 172nd Air Brigade ‚Äì controlling units at Podgorica ‚Äì the responsibility of choosing new pilots and working out new routines. Pilots were selected from a large number of volunteers, all of whom were experienced instructors and included two former members of the 1990 team, Major Predrag Vuka≈°inoviƒá and Captain Sa≈°a Ristiƒá. Under the leadership of Major Vuka≈°inoviƒá and Captain Ristiƒá each pilot was put through five test flights of the Super Galeb, two solo flights with the \\"boss\\" in the back seat, and another three outings, flying as a member of the full team. By February 1997, the team manager and commentator (who is also the reserve pilot) and six pilots with varying backgrounds ‚Äì one is a former MiG-21 pilot, while another flew the J-22 Orao ‚Äì had been chosen and training begun in earnest. New routines were practiced using a basic formation of four, interspersed with a synchro pair. The display is flown at between 160-435 mph (260‚Äì700 km) with the main formation maintaining a separation of only 2 ft (60 cm)! A \\"flat\\" program for use in low cloud base condition was also designed and practiced. The final program, which lasts for 20 minutes, was demonstrated before senior officers in April 1997 after which approval for public appearance was given. The new Flying Stars, with the three ‚Äì bar roundel replacing the former Yugoslavia Air Force roundels with new ones, were seen in public for the first time at the Batajnica air show on June 15, 1997. Other domestic shows followed at Podgorica, Ni≈° and Vr≈°ac, culminating in the first overseas appearance of a Yugoslav Air Force display team for nearly two decades. On September 27/28 1997, the Flying Stars and their support aircraft, a YAF An-26 with the ground crews and ground handling equipment, appeared at the Bulgarian air show at Plovdiv Airport ‚Äì Krumovo Air Base in front of more than 50,000 enthusiastic spectators. General Veliƒçkoviƒá, piloting his own Super Galeb accompanied them to Krumovo. The Flying Stars also appeared at the CIAF 1998 in Czech Republic. All seven aircraft of the Flying Stars team were destroyed on Podgorica airfield during the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia. General Veliƒçkoviƒá was killed on Batajnica airfield at the end of the war, he was only Yugoslav flag ranking officer who was killed during the war. Flying Stars After the war Flying Stars have appeared Air Force day‚ÄîAugust 2, 2000, at Golubovci air base, flying on regular G-4 Super Galeb aircraft painted in standard green- gray-blue color schemes. Soon after that, the bad situation in military and air force both, lack of fuel, aircraft and money have influenced the disband of Flying Stars. Its pilots continued aerobatic flying as test pilot of Flight Test Center‚ÄîVOC (now Flight Test Section of Technical Testing Center) performing their program on solo flight at Super Galeb aircraft at various airshows in Czech Republic, Hungary, Greece, Slovakia and Romania.  Aircraft  Soko J-21 Jastreb 1985‚Äì1990 The Flying Stars had for a short time, used seven Jastreb light attack- reconnaissance aircraft. They were painted yellow with the colours of the Yugoslav Flag in blue, white and red. After being replaced by G-4 they were returned to service in the Yugoslav Air Force combat units.
