It resulted from a breach of moraines forming a large glacial lake fed by the melting of the Late Wisconsin Laurentide Ice Sheet. The point of origin of the flood was Lake Chicago. The landscape south of Chicago still shows the effects of the torrent, particularly at Kankakee River State ParkFrankie, W.T., 1998. \\"Guide to the Geology of Kankakee River State Park Area, Kankakee County, Illinois.\\" Illinois Geological Survey, Field Trip 1997C, Field Trip 1998 B. 11-17. and on the Illinois River at Starved Rock State Park. Geomorphology features Michigan ice lobe at the alt=The Kankakee Torrent was responsible for extensive modification of the Kankakee River and Illinois River river valleys and landforms characteristic of megaflooding. Both the Kankakee River and Illinois River largely follow paths carved out by the torrent, a process that is believed to have taken only days. Most notable today is a region in north-central Illinois known as Starved Rock; while most of Illinois is located on a low-lying plain with little variation in elevation, Starved Rock State Park features several canyons which were created in the Kankakee Torrent.Filipek, K., Friant, K., and Richards, M., 1998, \\"Starved Rock State Park.\\" Department of Geology and Environmental Sciences, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois. Retrieved 2017-09-24. Another, very different, geologic effect left over from the Kankakee Torrent is the existence of \\"sand prairies\\". Sand prairies exist where the massive flood waters stopped their movement and deposited large quantities of sand. When European settlers arrived, one remaining sign of these deposits were sand dunes located along parts of the flood's course. The Kankakee River also bears several features that are direct results of the catastrophic flood. The Kankakee River State Park encompasses all of the types of features that formed as a result of the catastrophic flood event. Along much of its course, tributaries enter the Kankakee over waterfalls, a phenomenon known as \\"hanging tributaries\\". This is because the flood carved the Kankakee far deeper than would normal river erosion, and the erosion of the bedrock along the slow-moving tributaries has never caught up. This effect is most evident where Rock Creek joins the Kankakee. The Illinois State Geological Survey reports that Rock Creek is cutting through the dolomite bedrock to the waterfall point, upstream of its confluence with the Kankakee River, at the rate of per year.Wiggers(1997), p.131 The effects of the Kankakee Torrent were not limited to northeast Illinois. Both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers appear to have had their courses altered by the Kankakee Torrent, with the Ohio being pushed further south and the Mississippi further west. Flood hypothesis Designed from 1942 - Illinois Glacial Lakes by George, E. EckblawThe area is underlain by dolomite bedrock of Silurian age. Pre-glacial erosion of the surface of the bedrock created an irregular surface, allowing the glacial drift to vary in depth over short distances. Some areas are underlain by bedrock near the surface; in other areas it can be deep. Some hills are solely glacial drift; others may be entirely of limestone.Earth Science Field Trip, Guide Leaflet, Kankakee Area, Kankakee High School; 18 May 1957; John C. Frye; State Geological Survey; Urbana, Illinois; 1957 The water came from the melting \\"Valparaiso glacier\\", the glacier that deposited first the Manhattan moraine and then other moraines to the northeast in the Valparaiso morainic system. The melt-water came from three glacial lobes of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. In addition to the melt-water from the Michigan lobe in the Michigan basin, melt-water came from the Huron- Erie lobe to the east in the Maumee valley in Ohio and from the Sturgis Lobe coming out of Michigan across northeast Indiana. The water backed up behind the Marseilles moraine, forming a series of lakes. In the Morris Basin was Lake Wauponsee, which reached east up the Kankakee Valley into Indiana. It flowed south via the Iroquois River into Lake Watseka over the Chatsworth ridge of the Marseilles morainic system to the Vermillion River Valley, past Pontiac, Illinois. The volume of water was blocked at the gap in the Farm Ridge moraine, a unit of the Bloomington morainic system near LaSalle, Illinois. This blockage created Lake Ottawa between Farm Ridge and the Marseilles moraine in the Illinois Valley, and Lake Pontiac between the Cropsey (unit of the Bloomington morainic system), and Marseilles moraines in the Vermilion Valley. = Flood = The flood did not occur just once, or all at once. It was a repetitive event, over possibly hundreds of years. In the early years it was doubtless small, but as the years passed it became larger and larger until at some time it reached a maximum, and then, as the Valparaiso glacier receded, it gradually subsided. Before the torrent, the valley of the Kankakee River near the city of Kankakee, Illinois, was neither deep nor broad. It was a wide plain of Marseilles drift, with a small river. The early outflows spread across this plain. At its highest level, the torrent found channels in the Minooka ridge and flowed across the ridge to the drift plain in the west. As the outflows continued, the Marseilles drift plain in the east was eroded. This removed much of the drift and even began eroding into the Silurian dolomite beneath. In the last stages, channels were cut in the bedrock. The area along the southern bank of the Kankakee River, west of Kankakee, Illinois, consists of long narrow ridges leading to the northwest. These are gravel bars from the Kankakee outwash. The force of outflow scoured some of the dolomite bedrock, which can be seen in the gravel bars. The heavy flow of water transported boulders downstream and moved glacial erratics from the tills. The faster flow towards center created a channel, which the modern river still follows. Floodwaters were confined to the inter-moraine channels, which moved it west, then to the south. Upon reaching the LaSalle, Illinois, area, the flood entered the ancestral Mississippi valley, now abandoned. The area where the old Mississippi valley was joined is called the Big Bend of the Illinois River.Hajic, E.R., 1990. \\"Late Pleistocene and Holocene landscape evolution, depositional subsystems, and stratigraphy in the Lower Illinois River Valley and adjacent Central Mississippi River Valley.\\" Unpublished PhD dissertation, University of Illinois, Urbana ‚Äì Champaign, 301 p. Outwash Outwash from the glacier was carried beyond the Kankakee area. The coarser outwash, consisting of the coarser pieces of the local drift and of rubble ripped from the bedrock, became bars along the river. At the end of the outflow, the lighter sands and silts were deposited in bars and across the valley floor. The sand was picked up by the wind, creating sand dunes to the south and southeast. Sand bars can be found as far south as Sand Ridge State Forest in central Illinois.

Founded in the late nineteenth century, it remains an active parish to the present day. Its rectory, which was built in the early twentieth century, has been designated a historic site. Parish history During the middle third of the nineteenth century, Ohioans began to clear the forests of the Great Black Swamp region, revealing fertile prairies. As these lands became open for farming, and as the construction of the Miami and Erie Canal created significant demand for laborers, the economy of western Ohio grew rapidly.Brown, Mary Ann and Mary Niekamp. '. National Park Service, July 1978. Accessed 2010-12-31. Most settlers in the region were German farmers, while significant numbers of the canal workers were Irish.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: St. Patrick Catholic Church. Ohio Historical Society, October 1977. By 1850, priests of the Society of the Precious Blood had become established in the village of Minster, approximately west of McCartyville.DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 55. . From that place, they spread out to serve the Catholics of the surrounding region. Located in northwestern Shelby County, approximately apart, the two heavily Catholic communities of St. Patrick and McCartyville chose to co√∂perate in both civil and religious matters. In order to save resources, it was decided that individuals living near St. Patrick would go to McCartyville for their post office, while McCartyville's settlers would travel to St. Patrick for worship.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: Sacred Heart of Jesus Rectory. Ohio Historical Society, October 1977. St. Patrick's Catholic Church was organized in 1862; it was originally served by priests from Minster, and from Fort Loramie to the southwest.Brown, Mary Ann. Ohio Historic Inventory Nomination: St. Patrick Catholic Rectory. Ohio Historical Society, October 1977. This arrangement endured until 1882; in this year, the McCartyville parishioners were separated into their own parish, which was dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Twenty families formed the charter membership of the new church, which was the last parish to be created within the original boundaries of St. Augustine parish in Minster.Lamott, John Henry. History of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 1821-1921. New York and Cincinnati: Pustet, 1921, 156. Precious Blood priests continued to serve the parish until 1906; since that time, the parish has been served by diocesan priests. Property Three buildings are associated with the parish: the rectory, the church, and a former school. All three lie along the northern side of State Route 119 just east of its intersection with State Route 29. A cemetery is also associated with the church. =Rectory= From the earliest years of Catholic settlement in the Black Swamp region, parish priests typically lived at the convent closest to their churches. Early in the twentieth century, all parishes in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati were enjoined to construct rectories for their priests. Many of these houses were simple two-story rectangular brick structures with hipped roofs. The rectory at Sacred Heart church, which is similar to many other rectories in the region, lies immediately west of the church. Built in 1911, it is a square-shaped building with three bays on each side, that rests upon a foundation of cut stone with a concrete water table and a basement. Among its distinctive architectural features are a prominent cornice, large lug sills and lintels around the windows, and sidelights on both sides of the main entrance. Dominating the facade is a massive verandah- style porch with heavy brick pillars and a brick railing. The interior may be accessed through the recessed front door on the porch or through an exterior in-ground basement entrance. =Church= Located east of the rectory and west of the school, the recently constructed parish church is the largest building associated with Sacred Heart parish. =School= Many Precious Blood-served parishes in the Black Swamp region founded small parish schools for their children, because the Society and the settlers of the region placed great emphasis on Catholic education. Sacred Heart was one of these churches; its present school building was constructed in 1930. After only a few years of use, the school closed, and its building was sold to the state government for use as a public school. Recent history Front of Sacred Heart Church In 1977, the Sacred Heart rectory was recorded by the \\"Ohio Historic Inventory,\\" a historic preservation program of the Ohio Historical Society. The inventory found no evidence of a preservation program for the house; however, it was seen as being in good condition without any threats to its historic integrity. Although it was assessed at that time as being ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, it was listed on the Register two years later because of its historically significant architecture. It was one of more than thirty different Catholic churches, rectories, and other buildings to be added together to the Register; they composed a multiple property submission of buildings in western Ohio connected to the Society of the Precious Blood. Many of the churches in the region feature tall steeples that can be seen from far away; as a result, the region has become known as the \\"Land of the Cross- Tipped Churches.\\" Unlike its sister parish in St. Patrick, Sacred Heart remains an active parish in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. It is clustered with Immaculate Conception parish in Botkins and St. Lawrence parish in Rhine; all three churches are part of the Sidney Deanery.The Futures Project, Archdiocese of Cincinnati.

He was noted for his paintings of landscapes and structures. Early in his career, Guo Zhongshu served under the Later Han governor Liu Yun until Liu was murdered by the usurper Guo Wei. He later served in the Later Zhou and Song imperial governments, but was banished multiple times for behavioral problems. Especially in his later life, he was known for his eccentricity. Su Shi's eulogy as well as later anecdotes celebrated his apparent free spirit, wit, courage, and egalitarian tendencies. Alexander Soper, however, saw symptoms of schizophrenia which he blamed for Guo's death. Early life Emperor Ming Huang (ÊòéÁöáÈÅøÊöëÂÆÆ), collection of Osaka City Museum of Fine Arts. Guo Zhongshu was from Luoyang, while his ancestral home was in Shanghe County. A child prodigy, at the age of 6 he could already recite Confucian classics and compose essays, and that year he passed the Later Tang dynasty's national children's examination (). (The exam was for children under 15 who could recite Classics and compose poetry in both the shi and fu forms, recommended by the prefect and personally tested by the emperor.) He was also good at calligraphy, especially the seal script and the large seal script. Once, when shown a manuscript in the rare bird seal script, he was so absorbed by it that he read and copied it overnight. During the Later Han dynasty, Liu Yun‚Äîa cousin of the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou‚Äîwas named the military governor of Wuning Circuit (Ê≠¶ÂØß, headquartered in Xu Prefecture) in 948. Guo Zhongshu, who was around 19 at that time, went to Xu Prefecture and served as a prefectural judge () under him. In late 950, military governor Guo Wei rebelled and quickly captured the capital Daliang (also known as Kaifeng). The emperor Liu Chengyou was killed on January 2, 951. With Guo Wei's ostensible consent, the widowed Empress Dowager Li (Liu Chengyou's mother) chose Liu Yun to succeed the throne. On January 4, senior official Feng Dao was sent with her edict to Xu Prefecture to escort Liu Yun back to the capital. After Feng Dao's arrival, Liu Yun took most of his retinue (including Guo Zhongshu) and set out for Daliang‚Äîbut he wouldn't make it, because Guo Wei having consolidated enough power in Daliang was no longer satisfied with remaining a mere subject. On January 30, supported by thousands of his soldiers who made a (likely orchestrated) commotion, Guo Wei agreed to ascend the throne, and immediately general Guo Chongwei was sent with 700 cavalries to intercept Liu Yun, who had by then arrived in Song Prefecture. When Guo Chongwei came to Song Prefecture, he first met with Feng Dao outside the city gate before venturing inside to meet with Liu Yun. Realizing this is a conspiracy, the 22-year-old Guo Zhongshu angrily lambasted the 69-year-old Feng Dao, who had disloyally held high positions under the Later Tang, Later Jin, and the Liao dynasty before Later Han: Feng Dao was too ashamed to respond. Guo Zhongshu and others then advised Liu Yun to immediately kill Feng Dao, gather the troops in Song Prefecture and flee to Hedong Circuit where Liu Yun's father Liu Chong was stationed as the military governor. Liu Yun hesitated (because Guo Chongwei said Guo Wei had nothing but good intentions), but by the next morning everything was already too late‚ÄîGuo Chongwei had secretly taken control of his guards the night before and put him under house arrest. Guo Zhongshu fled to the \\"mountains and wilderness\\", and in less than a month Guo Wei founded the Later Zhou dynasty and had Liu Yun murdered. (Su Shi's eulogy (included in his Dongpo Ji Êù±Âù°ÈõÜ) offers a different account. It states that Guo Zhongshu resigned from his post before 950, following a quarrel with Dong Yi (), a staff supervisor ().) During Later Zhou and Song dynasties Traveling on the River in Snow (Èõ™ÈúΩÊ±üË°å), latter half of 10th century, collection of National Palace Museum. Guo Zhongshu reemerged in officialdom when Guo Wei was still emperor. He likely denied his former relationship with Liu Yun, because official records claimed he \\"swung his sleeve and spurned\\" Liu Yun when the latter offered him a position. At any rate, around 952 he had concurrent positions in the Imperial Clan Court and the Directorate of Education (where he was the I Ching specialist). The Later Zhou dynasty was replaced by the Song dynasty in 960, but Guo Zhongshu kept his positions. One day in 961, Guo Zhongshu came to the imperial court very drunk and argued loudly with Fu Zhaowen (), a Secretariat of the Heir Apparent (). When a censor () tried to submit a memorial criticizing them, Guo Zhongshu yelled at the censor, grabbed his memorial and destroyed it. Due to these unruly behaviors, on October 10, 961, he was banished to Qian Prefecture to serve as a revenue administrator (), but he did not mend his ways there. After he drunkenly beat up a local clerk named Fan Di () and failed to report for duty, he was arrested and further banished to Lingwu. Thereafter Guo Zhongshu became a drifting artist, wandering between Qi Prefecture, Yong Prefecture, the capital Kaifeng and his hometown Luoyang, often appearing drunk and untoward. If he chanced upon a beautiful mountain or body of water during his travels, he would linger for weeks even without any food. People thought he was odd: he could be seen standing under the scorching sun during the summer, and swimming in rivers floating with ice during the winter. He mingled with both the rich and the poor and treated everyone the same. Once during a trip, he got off his horse and invited his servant to drink with him in a roadside teahouse. The servant naturally declined because it was socially unacceptable, but Guo Zhongshu said: It was during this time that he became very famous for his paintings. The aristocrats and royalty whose homes he frequented often had to entice him with good wine, and a white scroll would be prepared beforehand on the wall: if he was in the mood he would finish a painting, but requesting one would result in him leaving in a huff. Thus his paintings became even more treasured. The 17th-century writer Feng Menglong included a funny story in his Anecdotes Old and New (). When Guo Zhongshu was in Qi Prefecture, a young man from a rich family was into arts and craved a painting from him, so he treated Guo Zhongshu very well with a daily supply of booze. After many days he finally told Guo Zhongshu of his desire and provided a long hanging scroll. Guo Zhongshu just drew a small child flying a kite, with the kite string taking up several feet of the scroll space. The young man was so enraged that he broke off with Guo Zhongshu. Zhao Guangyi became the emperor in 976, and being a connoisseur he summoned Guo Zhongshu back to the imperial court and provided him with sumptuous gifts such as silver belts. Ending his 15-year exile, Guo Zhongshu returned to the Directorate of Education to assume the position of master of records (). Initially the emperor had him stay with a eunuch named Dou Shenxing (). Guo Zhongshu had a long lush beard, but suddenly he shaved it all off. Dou Shenxing was puzzled and asked him. Guo Zhongshu replied, \\"Don't mind me, I'm just awkwardly imitating.\\" The eunuch (undoubtedly beardless) was so infuriated he complained to the emperor. Because cutting off one's body hair was contrary to Confucian social norms, Guo Zhongshu was removed from the Directorate of Education and assigned to the Taixue to review historical manuscripts. In the following months he again violated many rules and conventions, and the emperor had to pardon him again and again on account of his unique talent. Whenever he had too much to drink Guo Zhongshu could never control his tongue, and his slanderous remarks soon reached the ears of others. Guo Zhongshu also had a habit of selling his official accessories. Since these behaviors were punishable by death, when he was reported the emperor could only reduce his death sentence to an exile to Deng Prefecture with a round of clubbing. The year was 977, and he died when he got to Linyi in Qi Prefecture. He reportedly said \\"I will die today!\\" and stooped down to dig his grave with his hands, and when the hole got to the size of his face he collapsed and died. The escorting guards had to bury him hurriedly on the side of the main road, and it was several months later when his family dug out his remains for a reburial. Han Jian Guo Zhongshu authored at least 6 titles, all of them in the fields of palaeography and lexicography. Only one work is extant, the palaeographic compilation Han Jian (), which, among other materials, features the inscriptions of the Stone Drums of Qin. The name of the dictionary means \\"making the bamboo sweet\\" and refers to the process of preparation of the bamboo slips for writing (so called , ÊÆ∫Èùí, \\"killing the green\\" ). Despite being included into the bibliographic chapter of the History of Song, this work was much neglected during the following dynasties. Veracity of some interpretations in the Han Jian was not proven until the second half of the 20th century.Galambos, Imre.

He died in 1610 owning nearly 7,000 acres in Somerset and Hampshire, including the Rockbourne estate which he had only recently purchased. Cooper was then still a minor, but his ward-ship was acquired by an uncle for ¬£324, after a sweetener of ¬£600 was paid to Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, who was at the time the Lord High Treasurer. Cpoper's connection with Dorset dated from his marriage to Sir Anthony Ashley's only child, but initially he played little part in local affairs. In 1623 he was living with his father-in-law in St Giles in the Fields. He had four sisters, Bridget, Margaret, Martha and Jane.Arthur Collins, Peerage of England, pp. 545-546 On 4 July 1622, Cooper was created a Baronet by letters patent which described him as of Rockbourne in the county of Southampton. In 1628 Cooper was elected Member of Parliament for Poole. The parliament was dissolved on 10 March 1629. Cooper married firstly Anne Ashley, the daughter and sole heir of Sir Anthony Ashley, 1st Baronet, of Wimborne St Giles in Dorset. His first wife died soon after her father on 20 July 1628, leaving a daughter, Philippa (who married Sir Adam Brown and died in 1701) and two sons, Anthony-Ashley and George. Cooper married secondly Mary, Lady Morrison, the widow of Sir Charles Morrison, 1st Baronet and a daughter and coheir of Baptist Hicks, Viscount Campden (1551‚Äì1629). There were no children of the marriage. Cooper was probably recommended to the electors of Poole in 1625 by his wife's uncle, Sir Francis Ashley. He is not known to have contributed to debate during the first Caroline Parliament, and was appointed only to legislative committees concerned with larceny, benefit of clergy, and concealed Crown lands (25 June). Later that year, he was assessed at ¬£50 for a Privy Seal loan. Cooper again sat for Poole in 1628, this time failing to attract a single appointment. However, on 9 Feb. 1629 he confirmed the allegations of Catholic sympathies leveled by his friend Sir Daniel Norton at Bishop Neile of Winchester. Despite his hostility to the doctrines, practices, and ceremonies associated with the Pope or the papal system, Cooper displayed no obvious puritan leanings, being ‚Äòof an easy and an affable nature‚Äô and a compulsive gambler. His first wife died of smallpox in 1628, shortly after succeeding to the Ashley estate, and Cooper, who was reputedly ‚Äòvery lovely and graceful both in face and person‚Äô, He married again to another wealthy widow. According to family tradition he kept three houses fully furnished and staffed, and exercised great hospitality at each of them. He died of tuberculosis in 1631 at Cassiobury, his wife's jointure estate, and was buried at Wimborne St. Giles, leaving debts computed at ¬£40,000 or more. His widow Mary, Lady Morrison, took as her third husband the younger son of Edward Alford, Sir Daniel Norton acted as guardian to his Stepson and heir, Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, who sat for Tewkesbury in the Short Parliament, and who, as 1st earl of Shaftesbury, became one of the leading politicians of the Restoration era Notes 1630 deaths 17th-century English nobility 17th-century deaths from tuberculosis Baronets in the Baronetage of England English MPs 1625 English landowners John English MPs 1628‚Äì1629 Year of birth missing ","title":"Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"30266563","text":"McCartyville (also McCarthyville) is an unincorporated community in Shelby County, Ohio, United States.

McCartyville was founded during the mid-19th century, at the same time as the nearby settlement of St. Patrick. Settlers in both areas, who were heavily Catholic, decided to split social functions between the two communities: their church was in St. Patrick, and their post office was in McCartyville.Brown, Mary Ann.

The Mutschel is a traditional star-shaped bread from Reutlingen, Germany. The pastry, and the corresponding Mutscheltag (Mutschel Day), have probably existed since the 13th century. Mutscheln are roughly star-shaped and come in various sizes: usually approximately six inches in diameter, but bakeries often offer breads three or more feet in diameter. The most common Mutschel is made of wheat, yeast, a small amount of fat like lard or butter and eggs. They are sometimes made in sweet varieties. There are several theories about the origin of the bread form. One is that the high central part of the bread represents the castle atop the Achalm, a hill next to Reutlingen, and the eight points of the star represent medieval guilds. The star could also have Christian allegorical meaning as the Star of Bethlehem. A third possibility is that Reutlingen baker Albrecht Mutschler invented the shape in the 14th century. This baker was mentioned first in the 1435 Reutlinger Heimatbuch.Reutlinger Heimatbuch. 1954, p. 37. Mutscheltag On Mutscheltag (the first Thursday after Epiphany), townspeople gather in halls and homes to play dice games, the winner of which earns parts or whole Mutschel breads.Reutlinger Heimatbuch. 1954, p. 234. You can participate when you are invited into the circle. The Mutschelspiele (Mutschel games) consists of small games scored by tally marks. The games are won both independently and by grand total at the end of the hour or night. Before the game starts it is announced what the winner gets and some details of the rules. The rules can be changed between the rounds. The first rounds are played about the points, then about the center. If it is a very big one, the center is also cut into pieces. At later rounds, the winner might get a whole Mutschel. It is ok to eat it at the event, with some butter that is served, it is also ok to take it home and eat it the following days. It is also ok for someone who had lots of luck to give a part of it to somebody who has been out of luck most of the evening. Mutscheltag is about community, about sharing and making everybody happy and a winner at the end of the day. Usually, there is an abundance of Mutschels so nobody goes home hungry or without some bread for the next day. If a loved one can¬¥t participate, a friend pays a visit to bring over a Mutschel. In the neighboring community of Pfullingen, there is a similar custom with a cake called \\"star\\". The stars of Pfullingen have seven points, the Mutschel usually has eight points, very big ones can also have multiples of eight. Never call a star of Pfullingen a Mutschel, this might be considered offensive as it touches an old and deep rivalry between Pfullingen and Reutlingen. On the other hand, you might inaccurately call a Mutschel a star without being offensive because it truly resembles a star and is connected to the tradition of the Three Kings that followed the star to Bethlehem. Common dice gamesDer Mutscheltag. Reutlinger Wochenblatt newspaper insert. January 3, 2008. are: =Twenty-one= Played with one die. Player number one lays the die in front of him with one dot face up. He passes it to his neighbor on the right, who rolls and adds the numbers together (one dot from player one and the new roll from player two). She passes the die to the third player, who rolls and gets a new total. Whichever player reaches 21 or higher receives a tally mark. Play as long as desired. Choose whether the most or fewest tally marks wins. Note similarities to 21 (drinking game). =House numbers= Played with three dice. The point of the game is to get the smallest three-digit \\"house number.\\" Each player rolls three times. After each roll, write down the die result in the hundreds, tens, or ones place. The three rolls will therefore create a three-digit number. That is, a roll of one should most properly be written down in the hundreds place so that the house number can be as small as possible. A roll of six should be in the ones place. The rule can change to the opposite where the goal is to roll the biggest possible number. =Sequence= Played with three dice. The player who doesn't roll a sequence (1 2 3, 2 3 4, 3 4 5, or 4 5 6) receives a tally mark against him. Alternatively, players could play Yahtzee-style where after the first roll of three dice, a player can keep one or two dice and roll the others up to two more times. If after the third roll there is no sequence, she receives a tally mark against her. Play as long as desired. =Farm window= Played with two dice. Only the numbers 3 and 5 count. If players don't roll a 3 or 5, they receive tally marks against them. Play as long as desired. =Naked Luisle= Played with three dice. Players must roll every number from 1 to 10 twice. Roll three dice and combine them into totals. For instance, rolling a 1, 2, and 4 allows a player to score 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 by adding the dice in various ways. Rolling 3, 5, and 6 results in the totals 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9. Going around the table one roll at a time, each player must roll all ten numbers first. Once all are reached, players have to roll 1 through 10 again to \\"cross off\\" what was rolled before. The first player to roll all ten numbers, then cross all ten numbers off, is the winner. =Long duck crap= Played with three dice. Only rolls in which players roll a 1, 2, and 3 count; all other rolls result in a tally mark against the player. The group can choose to let players roll two or three times (Yahtzee-style) to try for this sequence. =Other games include= * The guard blows from the tower (in which players blow a die off an overturned cup and compare it with a hidden die underneath the cup) * Seven eat like animals * \\"M√§xle\\" (though it is not strictly speaking a Mutschel game).

Post-Classical amplifications and reinterpretations of that story and others involving her are dealt with in the main article. The instances mentioned here are more recent allusions and adaptations. Literature *In John Myers Myers's 1949 novel Silverlock, Circe turns the main character into a pig due to his proclivity for food and fornication. *Although Julio Cort√°zar titled one of his short stories \\"Circe\\" (1951), its main theme is about perverse sexual gratification in a repressed Catholic environment. Delia Ma√±ara is notorious in her quarter of Buenos Aires for the mysterious deaths of two of her fianc√©s. She lives in a twilight world and gains most satisfaction through the exercise of power over others. It emerges that she killed the two men by poisoning them with the sweets she makes; when this fails with her third fianc√©, he is freed from her fatal attraction by the knowledge.The mythical correspondences are explored by Sophie Dufays in Circ√© de Cort√°zar : au carrefour du mythe et du fantastique, Folia Electronica Classica, B Louvain-la-Neuve 2007, Num√©ro 13 In 1964 it was made into a film in Argentina with Graciela Borges as Delia. *In 1992 novel The Brothers K by David James Duncan, Everett has an extended sexual encounter with a woman named Circe. At one point she shows him a mirror and he sees himself as a pig in his reflection. *Circe appears in Dan Simmons' 2005 science-fiction novel Olympos, whose plot draws upon The Odyssey. *In Rick Riordan's 2006 novel The Sea of Monsters Circe runs an island health spa and turns Percy Jackson into a guinea pig (she says that they are \\"much more convenient\\" than real pigs), and his friend Annabeth Chase uses magical multivitamins to restore Percy to his true form. It is revealed she turned Blackbeard and some of his crew into guinea pigs, and once they turn back they wreck the place. *Madeline Miller's 2018 novel Circe follows the character through her life, focusing on Circe's own interpretation of events.  Comics  *In the DC Universe, Circe is a constant and deadly foe of Wonder Woman and is in league with the witchcraft goddess Hecate. *In the Marvel Universe, the immortal Eternal superheroine Sersi, created by Jack Kirby, is based on Circe, transforming Odysseus's men into pigs not out of malice, but because they were misbehaving at one of her parties. *In the 1963 Carl Barks comic Oddball Odyssey, Magica de Spell impersonates a modern-day descendant of Circe and lures Scrooge McDuck to a Mediterranean island to bid on \\"ancient treasure\\" (actually worthless imitations). Her initial plan fails, but she then discovers a sealed-up cave that turns out to be where the real Circe once lived. Finding Circe's magic wand, Magica proceeds to turn Scrooge, Donald Duck and his young nephews into animals, referencing Circe's abilities in the original Odyssey. Only the eventual destruction of the wand prevents Magica's triumph. However, in some later Carl Barks stories Magica is still using formulas she says she found in Circe's cave. Film and television *In the 1983 film Hercules, Circe is played by Mirella D'Angelo and appears first as an old woman. Transformed by drinking the hero's blood, she helps him when he is attacked by the robots that stand in for monsters in this 'updated' version, but for selfish reasons of her own. *Circe appeared disguised as \\"Mrs. Cissy Hawk\\" (\\"hawk\\" being the English version of \\"Circe\\") in the episode \\"The Remarkable Mrs. Hawk\\" on the show Thriller, hosted by Boris Karloff. The episode was based on the short story \\"Mrs. Hawk\\" by Margaret St. Clair, originally published in the July 1950 issue of Weird Tales. *Circe appears in the sixth and 12th episodes of first series of 2013 drama series Atlantis, portrayed by Lucy Cohu. *Circe appeared in the cartoon Ulysses 31 where she attempted to build a tower that would house all the knowledge of the universe, thus making her more powerful than the gods. *Circe is depicted in one episode of Hercules: The Animated Series (voiced by Idina Menzel) as a beautiful voluptuous young woman with long black hair, wearing a red mermaid style chiton dress and holding a dragon-headed magic staff in her hand, searching for \\"one good man\\" and picks Hercules' best friend Icarus. When she tires of his foolish behavior, she turns him into a platypus, later, Hercules into a lemur and then Prince Adonis into a peacock. * In an episode of the Disney cartoon series DuckTales, titled \\"Home, Sweet Homer\\", Circe (voiced by Tress MacNeille) appears as an anthropomorphic pig with a pet black cat. She attempts to send Homer forward in time, but her cat interrupts the spell, and instead Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie are brought back in time to ancient Greece. She eventually succeeds in turning Queen Ariel, Homer, and Scrooge into pigs, but is later foiled when Huey shatters her medallion; this not only reverses all the spells she has cast‚Äîcausing everyone she has transformed to revert to their normal selves‚Äîbut she herself is turned into an ordinary (i.e., non-anthropomorphic) pig. *In the animated show Generator Rex, Circe is a minor supporting character, who is the romantic interest and girlfriend of the titular character, Rex Salazar. Like her lover, she is one of the few E.V.O.s who appear fully human, and has full control over her strong sound-controlling abilities. *In The Simpsons, in 14 episode of 13 season (\\"Tales from the Public Domain\\") , Circe (Lindsey Naegle) appears in the first story, \\"D'oh, Brother Where Art Thou?\\". *In the book and television series Game of Thrones, major character Cersei Lannister draws name and traits from Circe. *In part 3 of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Pagan witch Circe has the ability to change a person into ‚Äúany creature she‚Äôs ever seen.‚Äù She transforms friends of Harvey Kinkle into pigs (then back again). She also turns a solid stone Roz and Dorcas back to life.  Video games  *Circe is one of the summonable Servants that appears in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order, appearing under the Caster class. She can be summoned after the release of the Salem story chapter. *Circe appears in the mission 'Old Friends' of the campaign in the 2002 Ensemble Studios game Age of Mythology as an enemy waylaying Odysseus and his allies in her trademark human-to-animal fashion. *Circe is briefly mentioned in the MMORPG Pirate101 as the Immortal that cursed the sirens Agalope, Calypso and Parthenope with their \\"irresistible\\" voices, which lured in Eagle captains to crash their ships into the island of Anthemusa. *Circe is a playable character in the MOBA game Heroes of Newerth.

Dick, first published in 1955 in Startling Stories and later in The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick. It has since been republished several times, including in Beyond Lies the Wub in 1988.  Plot summary The story takes place in the future where every family has a mechanical robot as a Nanny. A family of four has an older model Nanny, and every night, when the family goes to sleep, the nanny and the neighbor's nanny, which is a different model, meet in the back yard and fight. The Nanny gets damaged and must be repaired, which frustrates the family, as they're advised to upgrade to a newer model. One day, the kids take the nanny to the park, where it gets assaulted and killed by another, much larger and more powerful Nanny. Their father, upset with this, goes and buys a brand new Nanny, the toughest model available. The kids are excited, but later, their new nanny kills the nanny of another family, whose father is forced to buy another Nanny, an even bigger one.  Adaptation  The story was likely the basis for \\"The People's Choice\\" story in EC Comics Weird Science comic book and corresponding episode of HBO's Perversions of Science.

These raids targeted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bases and sought to disrupt the bombing of Japan by B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers operating from the islands. The Japanese lost 37 aircraft during this operation, but destroyed 11 B-29s and damaged a further 43. Preparations were also made for commando raids on the bases in early and mid-1945 but these did not go ahead. While the attacks on the Mariana Islands did not seriously disrupt the USAAF air campaign, they had an effect on other American operations. After determining that the Japanese raiders were staging through Iwo Jima, American forces stepped up their attacks on that island. While the decision to invade Iwo Jima had been made before the raids commenced, stopping the attacks formed part of the justification for the landing. In addition, further air defense units were deployed to the Mariana Islands to protect the B-29 bases. Background United States forces recaptured Guam and captured Saipan and Tinian in the Mariana Islands between June and August 1944, as part of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign.Tillman (2010), p. 68 These islands were needed to provide bases for USAAF Twentieth Air Force B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers to attack the Japanese home islands.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 578 Construction of the large air bases needed to support B-29s began on Saipan in June 1944, before the end of the Battle of Saipan, and work on air fields on Tinian and Guam commenced in July and August respectively.Tillman (2010), pp. 70‚Äì73 The B-29s of the XXI Bomber Command began to arrive at Saipan starting on October 12, and the 73rd Bombardment Wing began flying warm-up missions against Japanese- held islands in the Pacific on October 27 in preparation for operations against Japan itself.Tillman (2010), pp. 77‚Äì79 Locations of U.S. 20th Air Force bases in the Marianas Islands, on Guam, Saipan and Tinian, during World War II The USAAF bases in the Mariana Islands were within range of a number of Japanese air bases in the Pacific. These included Wake Island to the east, Truk and the Gilbert and Marshall Islands to the southeast, Woleai to the south and Yap to the southwest. To the north the Japanese had air bases in the Nampo Shoto chain of islands and Bonin Islands, which included three airstrips on Iwo Jima. Several of the minor islands in the Mariana chain also remained in Japanese hands, and there were airfields on Rota and Pagan.Cate and Olson (1953), pp. 578‚Äì579 The Japanese were unable to use most of these bases, however, as they had been isolated and heavily damaged by United States air attacks, and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had relatively few aircraft and pilots available.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 579 Despite the limited threat of attack, the United States military took steps to protect the B-29 bases in the Mariana Islands. The USAAF's Seventh Air Force played the most important role, and continuously attacked the Japanese-held islands until just before the end of the war. United States Navy (USN) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) aircraft and XXI Bomber Command B-29s also occasionally participated in these attacks. The Seventh Air Force also provided air defence for the Mariana Islands; this task was assigned to the 318th Fighter Group, which was equipped with P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, and the 6th Night Fighter Squadron which flew Northrop P-61 Black Widows. The Thunderbolts were also responsible for suppressing the Japanese-held Mariana Islands, though it proved difficult to stop the 3,600-man garrison from repairing the airfield on Pagan.Cate and Olson (1953), pp. 580‚Äì581 In addition, the US Army stationed elements of eight anti-aircraft gun battalions and two searchlight battalions on Saipan between July 1944 and February 1945.Stanton (1984), pp. 490‚Äì509 The head of the USAAF General \\"Hap\\" Arnold, who also directly commanded the Twentieth Air Force, was concerned about whether these defenses were sufficient, particularly given the high cost of the Superfortress bombers. Accordingly, he allocated a Microwave Early Warning (MEW) radar to protect the bases on Saipan. This advanced radar was not immediately installed, however, as the local commanders believed that the island's air defenses were adequate. Japanese attacks Locations of the Mariana Islands, Iwo Jima and Japan The first Japanese air attacks on the B-29 bases occurred while they were under construction. Small numbers of Japanese aircraft flying from Guam, Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Truk made occasional raids on the American forces on Saipan during the fighting there, but caused little damage.Denfeld (1997), p. 59 Between June 24 and July 21 the 6th Night Fighter Squadron intercepted 37 raids on Saipan, and claimed three \\"kills\\". These raids typically comprised twelve IJN Mitsubishi G4M bombers (labeled \\"Betty\\" bombers by the Allies),McFarland (1998), pp. 38‚Äì39 or IJAAF Mitsubishi Ki-67 bombers operating from bases on mainland Japan and staging through Iwo Jima.Francillon (1970), p. 190.Bueschel (1997), pp. 5‚Äì6. The attacks disrupted airbase construction on several days and contributed to delays completing the B-29 base on Saipan, Isley Field.Fagg (1983), p. 305 Small numbers of Japanese soldiers who had avoided capture at the end of the battles on the islands also raided the B-29 bases on occasion, mainly in search of food.Werrell (1996), p. 127 The main Japanese air offensive against the Mariana Islands began in early November 1944. On November 1, a B-29 flying from the Marianas overflew the Tokyo region for the first time. The next day, nine or ten IJN G4Ms belonging to the IJN Attack Hik≈çtai 703 struck Isley Field and the adjacent Kobler Field on Saipan. The raiders arrived over Saipan shortly after 1:30 am and dropped their bombs from low altitude. Only five bombs struck Isley Field, and these caused little damage. A Black Widow from the 6th Night Fighter Squadron shot down one of the G4Ms and another two were lost to other causes.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 581Sakaida and Takaki (2001), p. 27 On November 3 the Imperial General Headquarters issued a statement which falsely claimed that Japanese aircraft had bombed and destroyed fifteen locations in Saipan and Tinian.Hoyt (1987), p. 376 A further attack by either five or ten G4Ms with fighter escorts took place at 1:30 am on November 7, but also caused little damage. The USAAF official history states that three G4Ms were downed in this raid while another source states there were no Japanese losses.Sakaida and Takaki (2001), p. 28 Imperial General Headquarters claimed that 20 B-29s out of 40 located were destroyed in the November 7 raid.Hoyt (1987), p. 377 These and all subsequent Japanese air attacks on the Marianas were overseen by the Air Training Army.Foreign Histories Division, Headquarters, United States Army Japan (1980), pp. 28‚Äì29 Further attacks were conducted against Saipan during late November in an attempt to disrupt the American offensive.Bradley (1999), p. 10 On November 24, Marianas-based B-29s conducted their first raid against Japan, bombing targets in and around Tokyo.Tillman (2010), pp. 84‚Äì86 Three days later the Japanese mounted two raids against their bases. During the early hours of November 27, two G4Ms flying from Iwo Jima struck Isley Field from low altitude and escaped after destroying one B-29 and damaging eleven others.Tillman (2010), p. 86 This attack came as a surprise to the Americans, and construction lights were still on at Isley at the start of the raid.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 582 Later that day, twelve bomb-equipped Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zero\\" fighters from the IJN's 252 K≈çk≈´tai (252 Air Group) accompanied by two Nakajima C6N \\"Myrt\\" reconnaissance aircraft for navigation purposes departed Iwo Jima for Saipan. The attackers flew just above sea level to avoid US radar, and one of the A6Ms was forced to divert to Pagan after its propeller struck a wave; this aircraft was shot down by a USAAF Thunderbolt while attempting to land. The remaining eleven A6Ms arrived over Saipan at noon, shortly after XXI Bomber Command's second raid on Tokyo had departed. These aircraft strafed Isley Field destroying three or four B-29s and damaging up to two others. One of the Japanese pilots landed his fighter on Isley Field and fired on airfield personnel with his pistol until he was killed by rifle fire; this incident was witnessed by Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell, the commander of XXI Bomber Command.Sakaida and Takaki (2001), p. 33Hata, p. 117. The leader of the raid was Lieutenant Junior Grade Kenji ≈åmura. The raid was conceived and planned as a one-way mission. The 252 Air Group was based at Tateyama Air Field and forward deployed to Iwo Jima. None of the ten other A6Ms survived; four were shot down by USAAF fighters and six by anti-aircraft guns. The U.S. gunners also downed a USAAF Thunderbolt in circumstances which an official assessment later described as \\"inexcusable\\". On the night of November 28/29 six or eight G4Ms from Attack Hik≈çtai 704 bombed Isley Field from high altitude but caused little damage.Tagaya (2001), p. 91 B-29s burning at Isley Field on November 27 The United States military took steps to improve Saipan's defenses after the raids of November 27. Two USN destroyers were stationed northwest of the island to provide radar warning of further attacks. These ships detected some of the later Japanese raiders, but others managed to arrive undetected. An AN/TPS-3 radar was also flown to Saipan from Hawaii. Arnold became frustrated that the MEW still was not in use, and on December 3 Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the commander of the Pacific Ocean Areas, ordered that the highest priority be given to installing the radar. Despite this, it still was not ready until after the conclusion of the Japanese air campaign.Cate and Olson (1953), pp. 582‚Äì583 Two B-24 Liberator bombers fitted with air-to-air radar sets were also dispatched to Saipan. This was the first use of airborne warning and control aircraft by the United States, but they were not used in combat.McFarland (1998), p. 39 Further attacks were mounted in December. On December 7, Japanese aircraft, which included Attack Hik≈çtai 704 G4Ms and 110th Sentai (Wing) Ki-67s, conducted a simultaneous attack from high and low altitudes which destroyed three B-29s and damaged another 23.Bueschel (1997), p. 7. Japanese losses were heavy, however, with six out of eight Ki-67s of the 110th Sentai lost during this attack, the first carried out by this unit. The largest attack on Saipan occurred on the night of December 25/26 when 25 Japanese aircraft again attacked from high and low altitudes and destroyed one B-29, damaged three beyond repair and caused minor damage to a further eleven.Cate and Olson (1953), pp. 581‚Äì582 Also on 26 December, the Air Training Army was redesignated the 6th Air Army but retained the mission of conducting attacks on the Marianas.Foreign Histories Division, Headquarters, United States Army Japan (1980), p. 26 The raid on Christmas night was the last major Japanese attack on the Marianas. On January 2, a single Japanese aircraft destroyed one B-29 and damaged another three. A further two small raids were attempted in January and one on February 2, but none of five aircraft dispatched reached the islands and four were shot down.Werrell (1996), p. 128 In early February the 6th Air Army's parent headquarters, the General Defense Command (GDC), reached the conclusion that the raiding forces being dispatched against the American bomber bases were too small to be effective. As it was not possible to allocate additional aircraft to bolster these missions, the GDC directed that the offensive cease and that the 6th Air Army be held in reserve to be used against any Allied forces which landed in the Japanese home islands.Foreign Histories Division, Headquarters, United States Army Japan (1980), p. 27 Overall, more than 80 Japanese aircraft were dispatched against Saipan and Tinian between November 1944 and the end of the offensive in February 1945. The Japanese destroyed 11 B-29s, caused major damage to eight and minor damage to another 35. American casualties were 45 dead and over 200 wounded. USAAF fighters and anti-aircraft guns shot down about 37 Japanese aircraft during these raids. US counterattacks B-24 Liberators fly away from Iwo Jima after bombing the island on December 15, 1944 After the Marianas began to come under attack, the United States military stepped up its raids on the Japanese-held islands which could be used to launch raids on the B-29 bases. Particular attention was given to Iwo Jima, as it was correctly assumed that the Japanese aircraft which attacked the Marianas were flying from Japan and staging through the island en route to their targets. Following the first raid against Saipan in November, XXI Bomber Command B-29s were dispatched against Iwo Jima's airfields on November 5 and 8.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 583 These attacks were primarily training missions and caused little damage. The first raid was unopposed by the Japanese, but the second was met by eight fighters which inflicted light damage on a B-29; this was the first combat damage suffered by any of XXI Bomber Command's aircraft.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 550 The Seventh Air Force also increased the number of B-24 Liberator attacks on Iwo Jima, and these attacked the island 30 times during November.Cate and Olson (1953), pp. 583‚Äì584 Nimitz ordered a major attack on Iwo Jima following the raids of November 27 and dispatched Lieutenant General Millard Harmon, the commander of Army Air Forces in the Pacific Ocean Areas, from Hawaii to Saipan to oversee this operation. Harmon arrived there on December 5 and met with Admiral John H. Hoover and Hansell to discuss his plans for a daylight attack using all available P-38 Lightning fighters and B-24 and B-29 bombers in conjunction with a naval bombardment by the heavy cruisers , and of Cruiser Division 5. This operation was scheduled for December 7, but was delayed by a day due to bad weather. The attack began at 9:45 am on December 8 when 24 P-38s attacked the island. The B-29 raid took place at 11:00 am and the B-24s attacked at noon. Due to cloud cover over Iwo Jima the heavy bombers were forced to use radar rather than visual bombing, which limited the effectiveness of these attacks. The operation concluded with a 70-minute bombardment by the three cruisers which began at 1:47 pm. Overall, the USAAF dropped 814 tons of bombs and the cruisers fired 1,500 rounds of 8-inch and 5,334 rounds of 5-inch shells. The damage caused by this attack contributed to the cessation of Japanese raids on the Marianas until December 25.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 584Morison (2002), p. 11 The bombardment of Iwo Jima continued until the Battle of Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945. The island was attacked at least once each day by the Seventh Air Force's B-24s between December 8, 1944, and February 15, 1945, and several of these aircraft were shot down. Cruiser Division 5 also conducted naval bombardments on December 24 and 27 as well as January 5 and 24. In the last of these attacks the heavy cruisers were joined by the battleship . US aircraft also mounted small-scale night attacks to disrupt Japanese repair efforts. In addition, the USAAF continued to attack the other Pacific islands within range of the Marianas until July 1945. While the attacks on Iwo Jima damaged the island's airfields, the Japanese managed to keep at least one of them operational at all times, and none were closed for more than a single day.Cate and Olson (1953), pp. 584‚Äì585Morison (2002), pp. 11‚Äì13Tillman (2010), p. 87 The need to repair damage to the airfields forced the Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima to divert labor from building defensive positions, however.Garand and Strobridge (1971), p. 456 The combination of heavy losses over Saipan and damage to the airfields on Iwo Jima caused the Japanese to break off their attacks against the Marianas on 2 January.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 585 Few Japanese aircraft visited Iwo Jima starting in January, and due to their losses in the Philippines Campaign, the IJAAF and IJN lacked the long-ranged aircraft needed to resume attacks on the Marianas in early 1945.Burrell (2004), pp. 1167‚Äì1168 Operation Tsurugi In December 1944, the Japanese Army's 1st Raiding Regiment, an elite commando formation, was ordered to attack the B-29 bases at Saipan. A 136-man force designated the Giretsu Airborne Unit was formed for this suicide mission, which called for the destruction with explosive charges of B-29s by troops carried by Mitsubishi Ki-21 \\"Sally\\" bombers. These aircraft lacked the range to reach Saipan directly from Japan, and it was planned that they would refuel at Iwo Jima. The commandos undertook intensive training at Saitama Kanto and the raid was scheduled to take place on January 17, 1945, but was canceled after damage to the airfields at Iwo Jima. The Giretsu Airborne Unit instead attacked a U.S. airbase at Okinawa on 24 May, destroying nine aircraft and damaging another 29.Rottman and Takizawa (2005), pp. 53‚Äì57 Following the perceived success of the raid on Okinawa the IJN developed plans for a force of naval commandos to attack airfields in the Marianas. On June 24, it issued orders for a raid involving 30 Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" bombers and 20 G4Ms carrying naval commandos. The plan, Operation Tsurugi, called for the P1Ys to strafe the airfields before the G4Ms crash-landed on them. The commandos would then destroy as many B-29s as possible before fighting to the death. The commandos and G4Ms selected to land in the Marianas conducted intensive training at bases in northern Honshu and the operation was scheduled for late July. USN carrier raids on this area on July 14 and 15 destroyed many of the force's aircraft, however, and the operation was postponed until August.Tagaya (2001), pp. 95‚Äì97 Following its postponement the scale of Operation Tsurugi was expanded to include 60 G4Ms carrying 300 naval commandos from the 101st Kure Special Naval Landing Force and 300 Army commandos from the 1st Raiding Regiment. It was planned that 20 G4Ms would carry naval commandos to Guam, another 20 would carry army commandos to Saipan and the remaining 20 would transport a joint Army‚ÄìNavy force to Tinian. The revised plan also called for a B-29 to be captured and flown back to Japan. This attack was scheduled to take place between August 19 and 23. Allied intelligence became aware of Operation Tsurugi, however, and another carrier attack on Honshu destroyed 29 G4Ms and 20 P1Ys on August 9. While the operation was not called off after this raid, it did not go ahead after the Japanese surrender on 15 August.Tagaya (2001), pp. 97‚Äì100 The Japanese military also developed a plan to attack Saipan using Mitsubishi Ki-167 suicide aircraft during August, but nothing came of this.Zaloga (2011), p. 16 Aftermath A B-29 undergoing maintenance on Saipan The Japanese attacks on the Mariana Islands during 1944 and 1945 did not seriously disrupt the USAAF's strategic air campaign against Japan. They did, however, force the United States to allocate forces to defend the islands in order to prevent further losses of expensive B-29s. Moreover, due to the high cost of the heavy bombers, the ratio of losses was in favor of the Japanese. When the U.S. military was considering future operations in the Bonin Islands during August 1944 the planners assessed that an occupation of Iwo Jima might be necessary to protect the Marianas from attack, and after the war this was given as one of the justifications for the costly invasion of the island.Burrell (2004), p. 1164 However, this was not necessary due to the success of the Seventh Air Force and the USN's campaign against Iwo Jima's airfields as well as the Japanese military's shortage of long-ranged aircraft. In any event, the decision to invade Iwo Jima was made a month before the major attacks on the B-29 bases began, and there were no raids on the Marianas in the seven weeks before the landings began on February 19.Cate and Olson (1953), p. 586 Notes ;Footnotes Cate and Olson (1953), p. 581 state that the attack on November 7 comprised two raids, each made by five bombers, and that three of these ten bombers were shot down. Sakaida and Takaki (2001), p. 28 write that seven bombers were dispatched of which five reached Saipan and escaped after bombing American facilities there. They do not state that the other two bombers were shot down. Cate and Olson (1953), p. 581 give USAAF losses from the second attack on November 24 as three B-29s destroyed and two damaged. Tillman (2010), p. 86 states that three B-29s were destroyed and Sakaida and Takaki (2001), p. 33 give a figure of four B-29s destroyed. ;Citations References      Japan campaign History of the Northern Mariana Islands World War II aerial operations and battles of the Pacific theatre Airstrikes conducted by Japan ","title":"Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands"},{"id":"30267127","text":"The following ships of the Royal Thai Navy have been named Bangpakong: * , a Flower-class corvette, previously HMS Burnet (K348) of the Royal Navy and of the Royal Indian Navy, acquired in 1947 * , a Type 053 frigate built in the People's Republic of China Royal Thai Navy ship names ","title":"HTMS Bangpakong"},{"id":"30267151","text":"Scott Bostwick (June 22, 1961 ‚Äì June 5, 2011) was an American football player and coach. He served as the defensive coordinator at Northwest Missouri State University from 1994 to 2010 under head coach Mel Tjeerdsma, during which time the Bearcats captured three NCAA Division II Football Championships, in 1998, 1999, and 2009. In 2007, Bostwick was named the AFCA Division II Assistant Coach of the Year in 2007. He succeeded Tjeerdsma as head coach following the 2010 season, but died of a heart attack the following June. Early life and playing career Bostwick was born June 22, 1961 in Omaha, Nebraska one of the eight children of parents Robert Bostwick and June (Staab) Bostwick Blair. Bostwick was raised in the Omaha area and was a 1979 graduate of Omaha North High School. He then attended Nebraska Wesleyan University, earning a bachelor's degree in 1984. While at Nebraska Wesleyan Bostwick was a four-year letterman in football and finished his playing career as the Prairie Wolves third leading tackler all-time. Bostwick was inducted in the school's athletic hall of fame in October 2006. Coaching career Bostwick stayed on as a coaching assistant at Nebraska Wesleyan following graduation, and served as the programs defensive coordinator from 1986 to 1990. He next headed west to Bellingham, Washington in 1990, taking over as defensive coordinator for Western Washington University until 1994. = Building a Bearcat dynasty = In 1994, Bostwick's next career move brought his greatest success as he joined new head coach Mel Tjeerdsma as defensive coordinator at Northwest Missouri State University, a member of the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA). The MIAA had already produced several NCAA Division II playoff teams, and one national champion, Pittsburg State in 1991. After a disappointing 0‚Äì11 season in 1994, the Bearcats would over the ensuing 16 seasons win or share 12 MIAA conference titles, make the Division II playoffs 15 times, appear in seven national title games and win three NCAA Division II Championships. Bostwick's strong defenses were key to the Bearcats success, allowing only eight opposing players to rush for 100 yards or more over a period of 77 games between 2007 and 2010. For his efforts Bostwick was named the AFCA Division II Assistant Coach of the Year in 2007. Two of Bostwick's defensive players, Dave Tollefson and Steve Williams have gone on to professional football careers in the National Football League (NFL). =Appointment as head coach and death= On December 31, 2010 Northwest officials announced that Bostwick would succeed the just-retired Tjeerdsma as the Bearcats 18th head coach. Bostwick said he did not even know that Tjeersdma was going to retire until being told the week before his Christmas week announcement. At a press event following his promotion to top Bearcat, Bostwick told the media, \\"I've been a coordinator for 26 years and if I was ever going to be a head coach, this is where I wanted to be.\\" Bostwick, however, never had the chance to serve Northwest as head coach in an official game. On Sunday morning, June 5, 2011 Bostwick was at home mowing the yard when he collapsed and died of a heart attack. Three week after Bostwick's death Adam Dorrel, who was the offensive coach under Tjeersdma and who had played with him in the first 1993 0-11 season succeeded Bostwick.

Saudi Arabia maintains an embassy in Abu Dhabi and a consulate in Dubai while the U.A.E. has an embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah. Both countries are neighbours and as part of the Middle East and Persian Gulf region, share extensive political and cultural ties. The two countries are also known for being close allies in terms of foreign policy and geopolitical interests, collaborating closely during the 2017‚Äì18 Qatar diplomatic crisis and backing anti-Muslim Brotherhood governments in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt. However, the UAE and Saudi Arabia continue to take slightly differing stances on regional conflicts such the Yemeni Civil War, where the UAE opposes Al-Islah, and supports the Southern Movement (which has fought against Saudi-backed forces), and the Syrian Civil War, where the UAE has disagreed with Saudi support for radical Islamist militants. Relations were briefly complicated by the tenure of Muhammad bin Nayef as Saudi Crown Prince, who had a poor relationship with UAE de facto ruler Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan after the latter compared the former's father to an ape. However, relations have strengthened significantly with the rise of Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, with Mohammed bin Zayed aiding his ascension to Crown Prince and serving as a \\"mentor\\" to the younger prince.https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/06/13/saudi-arabia-middle- east-donald-trump-215254 Timeline of Recent Complications In leaked emails from 2008, Emirati Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba described Saudi leadership as \\"f***in' coo coo!\\" and that Emiratis had more \\"bad history\\" with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia than other any country. During the 2013-14 period, the United Arab Emirates reportedly hired the NSO Group, an Israeli cyberintelligence firm, to intercept the calls of Saudi Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, then-Minister of the National Guard, who was considered a contender for the Saudi throne at the time. In 2014, Al-Saadi Gaddafi accused Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and de facto UAE leader Mohammed bin Zayed of close ties to an individual involved in a 2003 Libyan plot to assassinate then-Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, contradicting Saudi claims that Qatar was involved in the plot.http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-king-assassination-plot- planned-uae-citizen-1134806678 In 2015 emails to former CIA Director David Petraeus, Otaiba disagreed with Petraeus on the utility of then-Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, describing him as \\"a little off his game\\" and \\"not impressive, much less lucid\\". During 2015, the United Arab Emirates hired lobbyists in the United States to promote then-Saudi Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman. In late 2015, Mohammed bin Nayef criticised Emirati interference in Saudi affairs, warning King Salman that Saudi Arabia faced a \\"dangerous conspiracy\\" involving a Mohammed bin Zayed-led \\"Emirati plot ... to help aggravate the differences within the royal court\\". On an email dated 21 May 2017, Otaiba noted: \\"Abu Dhabi fought 200 years of wars with Saudi over Wahhabism. We have more bad history with Saudi than anyone. But with Mohammed bin Salman we see a genuine change. And that's why we're excited. We finally see hope there and we need it to succeed.\\" In May 2017, an unnamed source allegedly indicated that Mohammed bin Zayed and Mohammed bin Salman planned a joint Saudi-UAE invasion of Qatar, which was ultimately abandoned due to opposition by the United States. Otaiba received criticism in August 2017 from Saudi royals aligned with Mohammed bin Nayef after he claimed that the UAE and Saudi Arabia now both desired more secular government in the Middle East, which they saw as an implicit criticism of the Saudi status quo.http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-royals-attack-uae-promoting- secularism-1924322203 The United Arab Emirates backed Saudi Arabia in its August 2018 dispute with Canada. By October 2018, UAE‚ÄìSaudi relations had somewhat deteriorated, with Mohammed bin Salman reportedly privately accusing Mohammed bin Zayed of involvement in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi to frame Saudi Arabia, and Mohammed bin Zayed described as expressing ‚Äúdisapproval‚Äù of his former protege. In July 2019, the UAE withdrew most of its forces from the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen following reported disagreements over the prospects of military victory, Emirati opposition to Islamist militias in northern Yemen, and Saudi support for Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi.  Saudi intervention in Yemen  Saudi Arabia along with the UAE and other countries are currently involved in a major war in Yemen. Since the start of the war, many soldiers and civilians have died; moreover, schools and hospitals have been damaged by the Saudi-led coalition. Territorial disputes Although the Saudi Arabia‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates border dispute was resolved in 1974, in August 2009 Saudi authorities prevented Emirati nationals from entering their territory using ID cards that showed a map including territory currently administered by Saudi Arabia.

The Corsican people had risen up against the French garrison of the island in 1793, and sought support from the British Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Hood. After initial delays in the autumn, Hood had supplied a small expeditionary force which had successfully driven the French out of the port of San Fiorenzo in February 1794. Hood then turned his attention to the nearby town of Bastia, which was held by a large French garrison. The attack was delayed by an unedifying squabble between the British commanders over the best method to approach the siege; Hood, supported by Captain Horatio Nelson, was over- confident and assumed the town would fall by assault and bombardment in just ten days. The French positions were however far stronger than Hood had assumed and in the end the siege lasted for six weeks, the garrison only forced to surrender when its food reserves ran out. Hood permitted the garrison safe passage back to France and began preparations for the assault of the final French-held town on the island, at Calvi. By August 1794, the last of the French had been driven from Corsica, which had become a self-governing part of the British Empire with a new constitution. Background In the aftermath of the French Revolution of 1789 the Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli, who had left in 1768 after the French invasion of Corsica, returned to the island, defeated his political rivals and took control.Ireland, p.145 Paoli then faced efforts by the French National Convention to take control over Corsica, and in 1793 orders were issued for his arrest during the Reign of Terror.Gregory, p.26 Paoli had long been supported by Great Britain, and as his supporters formed irregular units and drove the French garrison into three fortified port-towns on the northern coast, San Fiorenzo, Calvi, and Bastia, Paoli appealed to British agents in Italy for support.Ireland, p.213 The French positions were too strong for attack by Paoli's irregulars, and could be easily resupplied and reinforced by sea. Paoli therefore requested support from the British Mediterranean Fleet in the summer of 1793. The British however, under the command of Admiral Lord Hood, were fully engaged in the Siege of Toulon and could spare few forces to assist Paoli.Ireland, p.214 A British squadron was sent to attack San Fiorenzo in October, but was driven off by shore defences with heavy casualties.Clowes, p.212 The French were then able to land significant reinforcements on the island in November and even conduct some local offensives against the Corsican forces.Gregory, p.41 In December 1793, the French Republican armies were able to retake Toulon, forcing a hasty and chaotic retreat by the British fleet in which almost half of the French Mediterranean Fleet was recaptured intact and more than 7,000 refugees had to be extracted.Ireland, p.284 British planners had considered Corsica a suitable forward base in the Mediterranean for some time, although previous approaches to Paoli had gone unanswered.Gregory, p.27 With the loss of Toulon, Hood needed a forward operating base in the Ligurian Sea, and turned his full attention to the island.Gregory, p.51 In February he agreed with Paoli that in exchange for driving the French out of Corsica, the island would become a self-governing part of the British Empire, and sent a small force to attack San Fiorenzo. Initial attacks on coastal towers suffered casualties, but careful engineer operations, overseen by Lieutenant-Colonel John Moore, enabled the situation of artillery batteries on the heights over the town and after a short siege the French abandoned the town on 20 February, the surviving garrison retreating over the Serra Mountains to Bastia. Argumentative delay On 19 February, Navy Captain Horatio Nelson had landed a force of sailors to reconnoitre Bastia, returning with an optimistic report on its state of readiness.Mostert, p.122 As a result, the French garrison in the town, augmented by the remains of the San Fiorenzo garrison, believed that the British would make an immediate attack on the town, and established defensive positions in the mountain passes through which they had retreated. Preparations were also begun by the French to evacuate Bastia by sea, but when the British failed to attack within three days, the commander Lacombe-Saint- Michel halted the evacuation and instead set his men to improving the town's defences in anticipation of the inevitable siege. The town was large, heavily fortified and within easy reach of sympathetic Italian ports. Moreover, the French garrison was strong, comprising 1,000 French Army regulars, 1,500 National Guard and up to 2,500 French-supporting Corsican militia.Bennett, p.37 The British had sent Corsican irregulars to probe the French defences, but the commander, David Dundas withdrew them a few days later due to the freezing conditions in the mountains.Gregory, p.54 Hood's strategy to seize Corsica relied on speed, and rumours were spreading of a French relief force of 12,000 soldiers being prepared at Nice.Sugden, p.462 The admiral felt that a demonstration of British naval strength might be sufficient to intimidate the French, and on 23 February took the Mediterranean Fleet on an extended cruise off Bastia, sailing around Cap Corse, reconnoitering the town and then returning to San Fiorenzo Bay on 5 March. There he found that Dundas had made no preparations for the coming siege.James, p.189 During this operation, Nelson had taken a squadron close inshore to study the seaward defences and exchanged fire with the shore batteries for two hours without a single shot striking his force. Dundas was a cautious commander, who refused to send his force of 1,200 British soldiers from a patchwork of regiments and 2,000 untested Corsican irregulars against a French garrison he estimated to be more than 4,000 strong. He insisted that any attack must wait until reinforcements arrived from Gibraltar. Hood was furious, accusing Dundas of failing to press the attack and appealing to Dundas' junior officers, Lieutenant Colonels Moore and William Villettes.Gregory, p.55 This was an egregious breach of the chain of command and when Moore told Dundas of Hood's overtures the British general was so furious that he and Hood exchanged a series of increasingly angry letters before resigning his post on 11 March, passing command to Colonel Abraham D'Aubant.Gregory, p.56Mostert, p.124 Hood was unaware of the strength of the French garrison, assuming it to be far lower, partially on the advice of Nelson. Nelson however was well aware of the true size of the French force, and apparently withheld the information from his command in the hope of ensuring a frontal assault on the town.Mostert, p.126 D'Aubant was unpopular with both the Army and the Navy; Moore described his superior as speaking \\"nonsense\\", and Nelson called his behaviour \\"a national disgrace\\".Bennett, p.35 He refused to reconnoitre Bastia or to contemplate an assault without reinforcements. Hood commissioned several reports into the defences of the town, ignoring the report by Moore and Major George Koehler that accurately described the dangers of the town's defences and instead selecting a more optimistic report by a junior officer. Hood was confident that, once the attack was underway, the town would surrender within ten days, and ordered Villettes to land north of the town with his 1,200 men, supported by a detachment of naval gunners led by Captain Nelson.Gregory, p.57 Siege Villettes' force comprised detachments from the Royal Artillery and the 11th, 25th, 30th, 50th, and 69th Regiments of Foot alongside units of Royal Marines detached from the fleet. It was joined by Nelson's force of 250 sailors with eight 24-pounder long guns from HMS Agamemnon and four mortars sent from Naples.Bennett, p.36 While the army forces laid preparations for operations against the town, Hood stationed his fleet in a semi-circle just offshore, with HMS Fortitude under Captain William Young at the centre. Inshore, Captain Benjamin Caldwell commanded a squadron of gunboats to enact a close blockade of the harbour.Clowes, p.244 The frigate HMS Imperieuse under Captain William Wolesley was detached to blockade the island of Capraia, also in French hands and the site of large storehouses of food and ammunition, to prevent the garrison interfering in the siege or sending supplies to the defenders.James, p.190 The French made no effort to disrupt the landings or the subsequent siting of the batteries around the town.Sugden, p.486 By 11 April Nelson had assembled the batteries on the heights overlooking the town. Hood then sent a message to Lacombe-Saint-Michel, advising him of the British positions and inviting him to surrender. The French commander simply responded \\"I have hot shot for your ships and bayonets for your troops. When two thirds of our troops are killed, I will then trust to the generosity of the English\\". His approach rebuffed, Hood ordered Nelson to open a heavy fire on the town's defences; the ensuing fire and counterfire between the British and French batteries has been described as \\"immense\\".Mostert, p.125 Hood also ordered the 24-gun sixth rate HMS Proselyte, a small ship captured from the French at the Siege of Toulon and armed with 12-pounder cannon, to enter the harbour under Captain Walter Serocold and bombard the seaward defences. Serocold's ship shifted at anchor however and became exposed to heated shot from the town's batteries. A number of red-hot cannonballs lodged in the ship's stores and a fire started that rapidly blazed out of control. Serocold continued his fire on the town while calling for help from the fleet, managing to evacuate Proselyte into ship's boats and escape the harbour before the ship was entirely consumed by the flames. For fourteen days Nelson's batteries kept up an ineffective fire on the town, Moore noting that the placement of the guns on the heights was too far to achieve an effective bombardment of the defensive positions. Both sides suffered casualties during the exchange of battery fire, one of whom was Nelson, who was wounded in the back during a skirmish on a ridge overlooking the town on 13 April. By 21 April, British naval batteries had been established from Bastia, and on 25 April Hood ordered D'Aubant to bring his troops at San Fiorenzo over the mountains and seize the Cardo ridge, Hood calculating that Lacombe-Saint-Michel would be intimidated into surrender, but the British colonel refused on the grounds that such an operation would be pointless without the delayed reinforcements from Gibraltar.Sugden p.492 His order rebuffed, Hood resigned his forces to stalemate until he could starve the French garrison out of the town. Surrender On 12 May Lacombe-Saint-Michel slipped out of Bastia on a small vessel. His stated purpose was to assemble reinforcements, but it was clear at this stage that Bastia would fall and he sought to inform the National Convention of the situation on the island. He left command to his deputy Antoine Gentili. Three days later the expected British reinforcements finally landed at San Fiorenzo, and D'Aubant wrote to Hood suggesting a joint assault on the town. Aware of the impending surrender of Bastia, Hood refused and D'Aubant furiously resigned his command, although he was embarrassingly forced to remain in Corsica as Hood deliberately neglected to provide him with a vessel for passage to Leghorn. Bastia's food reserves ran dry on 21 May,Gardiner, p.110 and Gentili finally sailed from the harbour on 22 May, sending envoys aboard Hood's flagship HMS Victory to sign the terms. The conditions were generous: the French troops were to be repatriated to France along with those Corsican who wished to leave. All Corsicans who had joined the French were granted an amnesty and their property was to be respected. Paoli and his Corsicans were furious; Paoli's deputy Carlo Andrea Pozzo di Borgo attempted to intervene and was rebuffed by Hood, and Moore suggested that Hood had granted these terms to embarrass the army, whom the admiral publicly blamed for the length and failures of the siege.Gregory, p.59 Historian Desmond Gregory has suggested instead however that Hood needed the siege concluded primarily so that his fleet to return to urgent operations elsewhere in the Mediterranean.Gregory, p.58 Nelson was the first British commander to enter the town, later proclaiming that the siege had proved \\"that one Englishman was the equal of three Frenchmen\\". D'Aubant, who had still not departed from Corsica, arrived soon afterwards. The hospitals of Bastia were filled with sick French soldiers, and French casualties during the siege were reported as more than 700, in comparison with British Army losses of 7 killed, 6 missing and 21 wounded and Navy losses of 7 killed, 13 wounded.James, p.191 In the town 80 cannon were seized, and the small corvette Fleche captured and taken into the Royal Navy under the same name. Villettes was subsequently appointed military governor of the town, remaining in post until the evacuation in 1796.Villettes, William Ann, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Robert Holden and Desmond Gregory, (subscription required), Retrieved 9 September 2017 Aftermath With San Fiorenzo and Bastia now firmly in British hands, Calvi remained the last French stronghold on the island. British forces landed in June and laid siege to the town over two months, operations hampered by rampant sickness in the British camp and Hood refusing to provide the new army commander, Charles Stuart with adequate men and artillery necessary to break the defences under the command of French- supporting Corsican Casabianca. As at the earlier sieges, Hood and Stuart squabbled and blamed one another for failures in the operation, and Corsica was not brought under total British control until August.Gregory, p.61 The report of the siege written by Lord Hood and published in the London Gazette was later privately criticised by Nelson, who felt that he was not given sufficient credit for his part in the operation; in particular he was angry at the praise for Captain Anthony Hunt, a relatively junior officer who had played little part in the siege but whom was a personal friend of Hood. Despite this frustration, the victories on Corsica have been characterised as the moment at which Nelson first rose to prominence in the British naval establishment.Mostert, p.127 The victory at Bastia did however provide Paoli with sufficient evidence to persuade his fellow Corsicans to accept his agreement with Hood that Corsica would become a self-governing part of the British Empire.Gregory, p.65 Elections to a national parliament were held in Corsica on 1 June and on 16 June a constitution was announced, negotiated by Paoli and new British viceroy Sir Gilbert Elliot.Gregory, p.65 The constitution offered wide male suffrage, biennial elections and strong executive powers firmly held by Paoli through Pozzo di Borgo as nominal president.Gregory, p.73 Within a few weeks however Paoli and Elliott had fallen out over policy disagreements, and the relationship remained tense until the British departed two years later.Gregory, p.154 References Bibliography   1794 in France Sieges of the French Revolutionary Wars Conflicts in 1794 Sieges involving Great Britain Sieges involving France Battles of the War of the First Coalition Battles in Corsica ","title":"Siege of Bastia"},{"id":"30267434","text":"Marley Station Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Glen Burnie, Maryland. Opened in 1987, it was expanded in 1994 and 1996. The mall includes JCPenney, Macy's, Golds Gym and Sears as its anchor stores. The mall has 4 anchors and 130 stores on 2 floors. History Taubman Centers completed Marley Station in 1987. At the time, it included two anchor stores: Hecht's and Macy's. During construction in 1985 a body was discovered in a trash can on the site, which was not identified until 2019. Taubman expanded the mall in 1994 with a third anchor, JCPenney, which was the most-requested store among mall patrons at the time. Sears was added in 1996 as a fourth anchor. This store replaced an existing Sears in Glen Burnie which was built in the 1960s. In 2006, Macy's relocated to the Hecht's building when Macy's parent company bought that of Hecht's and sold its original location to Boscov's. Boscov's operated out of the former Macy's for only two years, closing the store in 2008 as part of the chain's bankruptcy proceedings. It was reported in 2012 that a 300,000-square- foot data center would open in the former department store. Taubman sold the mall to Mills Corporation, later part of Simon Property Group, in 2004. The Woodmont Company of Dallas/Fort Worth was appointed as the receiver to manage and lease Marley Station in March 2013 until Bank of America settles a loan dispute with Simon Property Group or forecloses. In January 2012, AiNET purchased the largest single building at Marley Station mall, the former Boscov's space, to operate the CyberNAP data center. Unlike the rest of the mall (except Macy's), the AiNET space is three-stories. At capacity, AiNET expects $1 billion in economic activity and 2,500 jobs at CyberNAP. In June 2013, AiNET (owner of CyberNAP) expressed an interest in buying all the properties to expand the data center throughout the mall. However, the mall's manager, The Woodmont Co., said there are no plans to sell or close down, but rather, \\"We are working to increase current occupancy by both retaining existing tenants as their leases renew and by leasing current vacancies.\\" At the start of 2012, Marley Station had a vacancy rate of 44%, up from 33% a year earlier. In June 2013 a spokeswoman for Woodmont said the occupancy rate at the mall was close to 85%. The mall was listed on a real estate web site as being up for auction on September 25, 2013. An eight-screen movie theatre, originally operated by United Artists Theatres, opened on June 5, 1987 near the mall's food court. The Movies at Marley Station were later run by Regal Entertainment Group, which had acquired UA. On February 20, 2014, the theater closed its doors after nearly 27 years of service without notice. Two months later mall management announced that the theatres would be renovated and reopened in summer 2014. On June 20 Horizon Cinemas opened four theaters‚Äîwith four more to follow later‚Äîfeaturing all new 3-D digital projectors, a new lobby with digital signage and upgraded concessions, updated bathrooms and roomier seating. Moody's rates the mall's debt. As of the 2015 report, the mall had near term rollover risk and is advising investors to expect 70% losses on their investment. As of the 2016 report, the mall was 29% of the remaining fund and all classes of debt were rated as below investment grade or in default. The mall's occupancy was reported as under 75%. During the same period, the mall was appraised for $39.8 million of the original $114.4M loan‚Äîin total there was a $88.7M difference between the appraisal and the total amount due on the loan. Aeropostale as part of its bankruptcy announced it would close its store at Marley Station Mall in 2016. In a February 2016 appraisal, the mall's appraised value dropped to $31.5M (-22.4%). In September 2016, Marley Station was listed for auction on the Ten-X website with a starting price of $5,000,000. The mall ownership rebuffed an earlier $10,000,000 offer by AiNET's Deepak Jain. In an auction ended on October 19, 2016, Marley Station was sold by LNR Properties LLC to G.L. Harris for a price revealed after closing on December 20, 2016, to be $22.7 million. LNR Properties bought the property from TKL East in 2014. TKL East obtained it through foreclosure from original owner Simon Property Group. The mall's vacancy rate was reported in January 2017 to be just over 2%. Marley Station Mall went back to auction on September 14, 2020. The sale price was $1.65M plus at least $15M existing debt.

Early life Gordon was the son of an Irish farmer, David Gordon and his wife Mary Deane. Gordon was educated in private schools in Ireland. He emigrated to Sydney in 1829 and worked in a number of mercantile houses before commencing his own company, which was involved in trade between Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales. In 1840 Gordon established a large store in Liverpool, founded a brewery and acquired 50,000 acres of pastoral land on the Murrumbidgee. In 1848, Gordon sold his assets in Liverpool at a great profit and became a wine and spirits merchant in Sydney. During his later life, in partnership with Edward Flood, he gained control over of pastoral land in Queensland. He was also the director of a number of colonial companies including English, Scottish and Australian Bank. Gordon was involved in numerous local organisations including the Presbyterian Church, St. Andrew's College, Sydney and the YMCA. Colonial Parliament In 1856 Gordon was elected as one of the three members for Durham in the first New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Gordon was a supporter of John Dunmore Lang, Charles Cowper and John Robertson particularly in questions of constitutional reform, education and land reform.

Regional train services on the Terni‚ÄìSansepolcro railway are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. Location Terni railway station is situated at Piazza Dante Alighieri, at the northern end of the city centre. History The station was opened on 4 January 1866, upon the inauguration of the Foligno‚ÄìTerni and Terni‚ÄìOrte sections of the Rome‚ÄìAncona railway. On 30 October 1883, Terni was transformed into a junction station, with the opening of the final, Terni‚ÄìRocca di Corno, section of the Terni‚ÄìSulmona railway. Many years later, on 15 July 1915, Terni became the terminus of another secondary line, when the Umbertide‚ÄìTerni section of the Terni‚ÄìSansepolcro railway was opened. Features The passenger building is currently being renovated, both inside (thanks to the Centostazioni program) and outside. The renovations include the construction of a terminal for suburban buses, a modern shelter for city buses, and the expansion of the parking lot. These measures will substantially upgrade interchange between rail and urban transport. Inside the passenger building are also other facilities such as toilets, ticket offices, waiting rooms, a newsstand, a tobacconist, restaurant and chapel. In addition, there are offices for the management of rail traffic, and an office of the Railway Police. The station yard has five passenger service through tracks. Many other tracks serve goods traffic and for storage of rolling stock. The passenger tracks are equipped with platforms topped by shelters, and the platforms are connected via an underpass. Train services The station has about 2.3 million passenger movements each year. The trains stopping at the station range from regional services to InterCity, Eurostar and high speed trains. Regional services on the Terni‚ÄìSansepolcro railway are operated by Ferrovia Centrale Umbra, which sub-contracts on behalf of Trenitalia. All other train services are operated by Trenitalia itself. Interchange The station is the terminus of all ATC urban and suburban bus services. It also has a special parking area for taxis.

In 1623 he was ennobled as Earl of Anglesey and Baron Villiers of Daventry. With little ability of his own, Villiers prospered chiefly thanks to the influence of his brother George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, a favourite of James I. Life Villiers was the third son of Sir George Villiers (c. 1544‚Äì1606) of Brooksby, Leicestershire, by his second marriage, to Mary Beaumont (c. 1570‚Äì1632), later created Countess of Buckingham. He had two full brothers, George Villiers, successively Viscount Villiers (1616), then Earl, Marquess, and finally Duke of Buckingham, and John Villiers, first Viscount Purbeck, as well as a sister, Susan, later the countess of William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh; while Sir Edward Villiers and Sir George Villiers were his half-brothers.A. F. Pollard, revised by Sean Kelsey, 'Villiers, Christopher, first earl of Anglesey (d. 1630), courtier', in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, online edition, dated October 2006, accessed 1 January 2011 Villiers was described as \\"unattractive and unintelligent\\" in his youth, but he shared in his family's good fortune flowing from the position of his brother George as king's favourite. In 1617 he was appointed Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King James I, and on 7 March 1617/18 he was granted an annuity of ¬£200. In December 1617 Sir Robert Naunton (1563‚Äì1635) a middle-aged man with no sons, was appointed as Secretary of State on the condition of making Villiers his heir, and during his lifetime Villiers gained from Naunton estates yielding ¬£500 a year. Villiers was granted an interest in the monopoly for gold and silver thread, in respect of which he was disappointed to receive only ¬£150 altogether, but he also had a substantial income from the patent for ale houses. In connection with that, he was accused in parliament of malpractice, but the charges were abandoned. In 1620 Villiers had expectations of becoming Master of the Robes, which would secure his position at court. Villiers searched for an heiress to marry, bidding unsuccessfully for the hand of the only daughter of Sir Sebastian Harvey, a rich City of London merchant, and that of Elizabeth Norris, daughter of Francis Norris, 1st Earl of Berkshire and Bridget de Vere. On 16 February 1621/22, a few weeks after Lord Berkshire's suicide on 29 January, John Chamberlain (letter writer) wrote to Sir Dudley Carleton: This heiress was instead won by Edward Wray, another gentleman of the king's bedchamber, and Joseph Mede wrote to Sir Martin Stuteville on 13 April 1622 \\"Mr. Wray is turned out of [dismissed from the office of] the bedchamber for marrying the late Earl of Berkshire's daughter, whom Kit Villiers looked for.\\"Birch & Williams, op. cit., p. 304 On 22 June 1622, Chamberlain wrote to Carleton: \\"The world talks likewise of divers [diverse] new earls to be made ‚Äì as Kit Villiers, if he can be taken off his wench, Earl of Berkshire.\\"Birch & Williams, op. cit., p. 316 Villiers then married Elizabeth, the daughter and heir of Thomas Sheldon of Howley, Leicestershire.The Herald and genealogist, vol. 3 (1866), p. 192 On 18 April 1623 Villiers was ennobled as Earl of Anglesey and Baron Villiers of Daventry. This had been in the air for more than a year, with the king seeking to persuade Villiers to give up a mistress, but in the event he had failed to do so.Renaissance papers, vol. 1978 (Southeastern Renaissance Conference, 1984), pp. 97-98: \\"The patent was delayed for a year, but Kit eventually managed to obtain his peerage without relinquishing the wench... The historical Kit Villiers, Earl of Anglesey, summed up all that was unsavory and corrupt with the court of James I.

E. Cokayne, The complete peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain, and the United Kingdom (1887‚Äì1898), vol. 1, p. 132 (note) Joseph Mede wrote to Sir Martin Stuteville on 23 April 1625: The appointment of Villiers as Master of the Robes died with the old king, with Charles I retaining Lord Compton, who had served him in that capacity as Prince of Wales. According to one historian of the period, Villiers \\"summed up all that was unsavory and corrupt with the court of James I\\". His brother, Buckingham, died on 23 August 1628. Despite this, in December 1628 Villiers gained the position of Keeper of Hampton Court Palace, and in March 1629 he became also Keeper of Bushey Park. He was believed to have bought the reversion of the office of Chancellor of the Exchequer from Edward Barrett, 1st Lord Barrett of Newburgh, but he died at Windsor on 3 April 1630. On 12 April he was entombed there in St George's Chapel. At the time of his death, Villiers was living at Ashley Park, Walton- on-Thames.The house was demolished about 1925 (Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600-1840, 3rd ed. 1995, s.v. \\"Pearce, Sir Edward Lovett\\". His widow, Elizabeth, Countess of Anglesey, married secondly Benjamin Weston, Esquire, and they continued to live there. Villiers's titles and estates passed first to his only son, Charles, who died childless on 4 February 1661. Charles had married the widow of his cousin William Villiers, 2nd Viscount Grandison.

The first Chehalis Western, which existed from 1936 until 1975, was a shortline Class III railroad operating in Washington state, while the second one, which existed from 1981 until 1993, was a private railroad that operated on a different set of lines that Weyerhaeuser had later acquired.  History  In 1936, Weyerhaeuser incorporated the Chehalis Western Railroad as a publicly regulated, common-carrier shortline to carry lumber and forest products over a 10-mile stretch of track from Chehalis, Washington to Ruth, Washington that Weyerhaeuser had purchased from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, also known as the Milwaukee Road.http://www.trainweb.org/cwwr/ The Chehalis Western also operated on trackage rights over the Milwaukee Road from Chehalis to Western Junction, where the trains would join a Weyerhaeuser-owned logging line (known as the \\"Vail\\" line) that would go north to a log dump at South Bay, Washington. And Chehalis Western trains also operated on trackage rights over the Northern Pacific Railroad from Pe Ell, Washington to Milburn, Washington. On December 1, 1975, Weyerhaeuser reorganized the railroad under a new name, the Curtis, Milburn & Eastern Railroad. The CM&E; stopped operating on the trackage rights between Pe Ell and Milburn, and the line only operated between Chehalis and Curtis, Washington. The CM&E; stopped operating in 1980 and was formally abandoned in February 1993. The Chehalis Western Railroad name was resurrected in 1980, when the Milwaukee Road abandoned all of its trackage west of Miles City, Montana. At that point, Weyerhaeuser acquired all of the Milwaukee Road's trackage south of Tacoma, Washington, except for some trackage rights. The lines that Weyerhaeuser purchased measured <23 miles long and were the Milwaukee Road's routes from Tacoma to Chehalis and from Frederickson, Washington to Morton, Washington.Trains magazine, July 1981, p. 18. In order to service the new lines, Weyerhaeuser purchased four brand-new EMD GP38-2 locomotives.Trains magazine, January 1982, p. 21. When the new Chehalis Western assumed operation of the Milwaukee Road tracks, operation of the Curtis, Milburn and Eastern trackage was resumed under the CWWR name. Curtis was used as a log reload yard and loads were daily (Monday through Friday) brought to Western Junction. Vail, WA was the other reload point and those loads were daily brought to Western Junction as well. The loads then would be combined and brought to Port of Tacoma. In the latter part of the 1980s, Curtis was converted to a pole yard where power poles from a nearby mill were sorted and then loaded to railcars. These pole loads would then be brought to an interchange point in Chehalis with the Union Pacific Railway. Subsequently, the only remaining log reload point was at Vail. Only 42 carloads of raw logs were hauled in daily Monday through Friday to Tacoma after the conversion of the Curtis reload. This practice remained until operations were ceased in 1992. Sometime in the early 1980s or before, the South Bay operation was discontinued and the tracks were removed from Western Junction to the end of the line at South Bay. Although Weyerhauser did purchase the Morton subdivision of the Milwaukee Road from Fredrickson, WA to Morton WA, no operations were ever begun on this segment. And this was despite the fact they spent a sizeable sum to replace a rather large bridge that had burned in 1979 near Eatonville, WA that crosses the Little Mishael River over a rather deep canyon. Only the Mt. Rainier Scenic Railroad ever operated trains on an 8-mile segment between Elbe, WA and Mineral, WA during the time between the Milwaukee Road abandonment and the acquisition of the CWWR assets by the City of Tacoma in 1995. Subsequently, much of the Morton Subdivision fell into disrepair that had not been used, but was revitalized by the City of Tacoma after they had acquired it. In July 1992, Weyerhaeuser shut down the second incarnation of the Chehalis Western. In 1995, Weyerhaeuser sold the entire railroad to the city of Tacoma for $3.1 million. At that point, the city contracted with the Tacoma Eastern Railway to begin operations on the line, and then contracted with Tacoma Rail to operate the trackage. In addition, the city of Tacoma began allowing two excursion railroads to operate over portions of the line: the Chehalis‚ÄìCentralia Railroad, which now operates from Chehalis west to Ruth, Washington (and as a result, operates on the now-restored tracks of the first Chehalis Western Railroad), and the 7-mile Mount Rainier Scenic Railroad, which operates between Tacoma and Morton. Today, the Chehalis Western Trail is a bike trail that uses a portion of the \\"Vail\\" logging line that the Chehalis Western would travel over to South Bay, in the vicinity of Lacey, Washington.

Developed and controlled by Texas billionaire investor Harold Simmons until his death at the end of 2013, the company was founded in Dallas, Texas in 1989 as a landfill operator, and awarded a unique license for disposal of low level radioactive waste in 2009. Its main operations are in remote West Texas. J.F. Lehman & Company (JFLCO) acquired Waste Control Specialists LLC from Valhi, Inc. in January 2018. The acquisition represents JFLCO's fourth platform investment in the environmental and technical services sector. WCS also has a strategic partnership with J.F Lehman & Company portfolio company NorthStar Group Holdings, Inc., a leading provider of specialized environmental and technical services for commercial and government end markets, to support domestic electric utilities in safely decommissioning nuclear power generation sites.  Overview WCS is the only privately owned and operated facility in the United States that has been licensed to treat, store and dispose of Class A, B, C low level radioactive waste (LLRW), and to store Greater than Class C LLRW. The Dallas-based company was recruited to Andrews, Texas by business leaders looking to diversify an economy dominated by the oil and gas industry. WCS‚Äô facility in western Andrews County is the only commercial facility in the United States licensed in more than 30 years to dispose of Class A, B and C low-level radioactive waste. It is also licensed for the treatment and storage of low-level radioactive waste, and has served as a temporary storage facility for U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) projects. WCS met all operating guidelines established by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The WCS facility also is the site of the disposal facility for the Texas Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact, and was the site of the storage and disposal of byproduct material from the DOE Fernald, Ohio cleanup site in 2009.http://dshs.texas.gov/radiation/2010Conf/PDFMainSession_FridayWaste/02-Status_of_Waste_Management_and_Disposal.doc In 2011 a vote was held by the Texas Low Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Commission that will allow WCS to import waste from 36 other states across the US. Disposal of low-level radioactive waste is in concrete containers buried 45 to 100 feet below the surface in concrete-lined cells in the red bed clay formations. Space between the containers is filled to help prevent shifting. As the cells are filled, they will be covered by more than 300 feet of liner material and red bed clay and the surface will be restored to its natural state.

The Corsican people had risen up against the French Republican garrison in 1793 after an attempt to arrest the Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli during the Reign of Terror. The French had then been driven into three fortified towns on the northern coast; San Fiorenzo, Calvi, and Bastia and Paoli appealed to the British Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet, commanded by Lord Hood, for assistance against the French garrison. In the autumn of 1793 Hood was distracted by the Siege of Toulon, but did send a squadron with orders to attack San Fiorenzo. The attack achieved initial success but was driven off by the fortifications at the Torra di Fornali. After the fall of Toulon in December 1793, Hood turned his main attention to Corsica and ordered a joint operation against the town, attacking from the sea and with amphibious landings. Over two weeks the main defences of the town were defeated by a series of artillery operations which drove the French out of their defences one by one and destroyed the French shipping in the harbour. On 18 February the French garrison withdrew across the island to Bastia, which was attacked in turn later in the spring. By August 1794, the French had been driven from Corsica, which had become a self-governing part of the British Empire. Background Following the French Revolution of 1789, the Corsican leader Pasquale Paoli returned to the island to popular acclaim.Ireland, p.145 Paoli had fled into exile in 1768 after the French invasion and annexation of Corsica, and had been supported in exile by Great Britain.Gregory, p.18 Paoli rapidly defeated his political rivals to become de facto ruler of the island once more, but resisted efforts by the National Convention to exercise control over Corsica and in 1793, as the Reign of Terror swept France, orders were issued for his arrest.Gregory, p.25 Paoli responded to the threat of arrest by raising a small army of Corsican irregular troops, known principally for their snipers.Gregory, p.54 These forces rapidly made movement around the island by French troops impossible and the French garrison retreated to three fortified port-towns on the northern coast, San Fiorenzo, Calvi, and Bastia.Ireland, p.213 Paoli's irregulars had neither the discipline nor the equipment to attack these positions, which could be resupplied and reinforced by sea, and so Paoli turned to Great Britain for support.Gregory, p.26 British diplomats in Italy had for some time been advocating British intervention in Corsica, and had sent previous approaches to Paoli which had so far been ignored.Gregory, p.27 By the summer of 1793 however a large British fleet had arrived in the region with orders to blockade the ports of southern France. The particular focus of this operation was the large French fleet base at Toulon, and the British fleet, under Admiral Lord Hood needed a forward base with a sheltered anchorage from which this operation could be organized; Corsica seemed the ideal location. Hood however was immediately distracted by a Royalist uprising in Toulon. Having expelled the Republican leaders of the city the Royalists offered it to Hood, who entered the port, seized the French fleet and occupied the town in August. The Republican forces then laid siege to the city, and Hood had few forces to spare to assist Paoli.Gregory, p.38 Linzee's attack NMM In response to Paoli's continuing appeals for support, Hood detached a naval squadron in late September, comprising the ships of the line HMS Alcide, HMS Courageux and HMS Ardent and the frigates HMS Nemesis and HMS Lowestoft under the command of Commodore Robert Linzee.James, p.85 This force was under orders to take letters signed by Hood to the garrisons of the French-held towns offering terms of surrender similar to those offered at Toulon. If these were ineffective, Linzee was to blockade the ports and, if practicable, to attack and capture them.Gregory, p.40 The letters were ignored, and Linzee's forces were too few and inadequately equipped to effectively blockade the rocky inlets of the Corsican coast from which smugglers routinely sailed to Italy.Gregory, p.41 Linzee therefore determined to attack San Fiorenzo, on the northwestern coast of Corsica at the southern end of Cap Corse. San Fiorenzo was strategically important for its large sheltered bay, defended by fortifications at Torra di Mortella and Torra di Fornali. On 19 September Linzee sent Nemesis and Lowestoft to attack Torra di Mortella, which was abandoned by its garrison undamaged after three broadsides from Lowestoft.James, p.86 British sailors landed and entered the tower, but returned to their ships the next day. Linzee then waited a week before attacking Torra di Fornali, a much stronger position protected by coastal batteries.Clowes, p.212 On 1 October at 03:30, Linzee sent Ardent, Alcide and Courageux to bombard Fornali. The ships came under heavy fire not only from the tower and batteries, but also from additional artillery in the town of San Fiorenzo itself, including heated shot. These red hot cannonballs started fires on board the attacking ships, and at 08:15 the squadron retreated out of the bay with all three ships damaged, 19 sailors killed and 35 wounded. The effect on Torra di Fornali was negligible. Linzee claimed that he had been given inaccurate information on the strength of the fortifications by Corsican informants and that he had only ordered the attack on the understanding that it would be supported by an attack from the land by the Corsican irregular forces which never materialised.James, p.87 Hood later accused Paoli of \\"a composition of art and deceit\\" in relation to this operation.Ireland, p.214 The British force withdrew, and in late October a French frigate squadron was sent to San Fiorenzo with reinforcements, escaping an attack by the British ship of the line HMS Agamemnon under Captain Horatio Nelson off Sardinia at the Action of 22 October 1793.James, p.106 From this force the French frigates Minerve and Fortun√©e anchored in the bay under the shelter of the batteries. During this landing the disarmed Torra di Mortella was abandoned by its Corsican garrison and recaptured by the French.Gregory, p.41 Invasion of Corsica In Southern France Hood's situation at Toulon became untenable when the French army, led in part by a young Corsican artillery officer named Napoleon Bonaparte, seized the heights over looking the harbour and began to bombard the British fleet.Gardiner, p.86 In the panicked withdrawal that followed half of the French fleet was burned and 7,000 refugees were removed before Republican forces stormed the city and massacred much of the remaining population.Ireland, p.284 Corsica now became a priority for Hood, whose fleet was stationed in the temporary anchorage of the √éles d'Hy√®res. Paoli was enthused by the defeat at Toulon, recognising his opportunity for support, and negotiated with Hood's envoy Sir Gilbert Elliot to turn Corsica into a self-governing colony of the British Empire if Hood could drive the French from the island.Gregory, p.51 On 24 January 1794 Hood gave orders for a combined operation against San Fiorenzo, and the fleet sailed from √éles d'Hy√®res. Driven back by a storm, the fleet sheltered at Portoferraio, and on 4 February an expeditionary force of 1,400 British troops under General David Dundas sailed for the Bay of San Fiorenzo, accompanied by Linzee in Alcide HMS Egmont, HMS Fortitude, Lowestoft and HMS Juno.Clowes, p.243 Dundas' force comprised detachments from the Royal Artificers, Royal Artillery, Royal Fusiliers and the 11th, 25th, 30th, 50th, 51st and 69th Regiments of Foot which had been serving as marines on board the fleet. Dundas, as senior Army officer in the Mediterranean, had assumed command of the land forces, but he and Hood hated one another, their enmity worsened by the chaotic scenes at the evacuation of Toulon. Cautious and dour, Dundas resented Hood's command, particularly given Hood's lack of understanding of the logistical problems of land warfare. Throughout the campaign Hood wrote letters to London criticising Dundas and undermining his authority.Gregory, p.52-53 On 7 February the troops disembarked from the transports, landing unopposed on the coast to the west of the Torra di Mortella. =Bombardment of Mortella= On 8 February Linzee ordered Juno and Fortitude under Captain William Young to bombard the Torra di Mortella from the sea while engineers under Lieutenant-Colonel John Moore hauled cannon up the steep hills that overlooked the fortification. The British fire had little impact on the tower, and heated shot from the tower's two 18-pounder long guns ignited an ammunition box on board Fortitude which exploded, killing six sailors and wounding 56. Serious damage was done to the ship's mainmast and rigging and Young was forced to withdraw.James, p.187 The following day, after resiting his artillery to better effect, Moore was able to open fire on Torra di Mortella from the land. The tower's guns were not well situated to respond, and eventually a shot caused an explosion and fire on the tower's parapet that persuaded the tower's commander, Ensign Thomas le Tellier, to surrender. His garrison of 33 had suffered two killed and the rest were made prisoner.James, p.188 Moore immediately began to move his artillery again, seeking a new position that would overlook a new fortification erected between Mortella and Fornali named the Convention Redoubt.Mostert, p.121 =Outflanking the Convention Redoubt= Since Linzee's attack on San Fiorenzo in September 1793, the French had reinforced the defences of the town by enclosing an open battery and equipping it with 21 heavy cannon. This position was too strong to attack by sea and too heavily protected to storm directly by land. Moore realised however that there were higher positions disdained by the French as impractical, which overlooked the Redoubt.Gregory, p.53-54 From 12 February Moore's artillery teams, composed of sailors detached from the squadron, hauled four 18-pounder cannon, a large howitzer and a 10\\" mortar to a point above sea level. The only route to this position was a single-track path along a sheer cliff, the guns moved with block and tackle systems across the rocky terrain. By 16 February the guns were in position, and for two days the Convention Redoubt came under sustained fire. An additional gun reached the summit on 17 February and another was emplaced on the shore to prevent the French frigates from bombarding British positions from the sea. On the evening of 17 February Moore prepared his forces for an assault on the Redoubt, forming three columns. Moore lead the right column, composed of Royals and men of the 51st Regiment, while the centre column was led by men from the 50th Regiment and the left column followed the shoreline, and was made up of men from 25th Regiment. The three columns attacked simultaneously under cover of fire from the new battery on the hill, and despite heavy fire from the French batteries were able to enter the redoubt and drive the French garrison out of the rear entrance and down the hill in hand-to-hand bayonet combat. Corsican irregulars supported the assault with a diversionary attack to the right of Moore's column. In the bombardment and assault approximately 100 French troops were killed or wounded and 70 made prisoners of war. The British force lost 17 men killed and 36 wounded.James, p.189 The surviving French forces retreated from the Convention Redoubt and across a ravine to the defences around the Torra di Fornali, which had driven off Linzee's squadron in September 1793. A strong position so far undamaged by the bombardment, the British were concerned that it would cause heavy casualties to an attacking force, but the retreating French were panicked and concerned about being cut off, so that during the night the tower and batteries were abandoned, the French soldiers falling back to San Fiorenzo, accompanied by the frigates. =French evacuation= With the tower in British hands, Linzee's squadron anchored under the guns of Fornali and British batteries began to bombard the town and harbour on 18 February, cannon fire striking Minerve and sinking the frigate in shallow water.Clowes, p.244 The following morning and with the French clearly planning to evacuate the town, Dundas sent in a message offering terms of surrender, but these were refused. In response Corsican forces were sent to the mountain road that linked Bastia and San Fiorenzo to prevent the French from retreating. At 16:00 on 19 February the remaining frigate Fortun√©e was set on fire and destroyed in the bay. At the same time a boat rowed to the British positions and announced that the town had been abandoned. Aftermath On 20 February Moore's forces entered and occupied the town, taking 32 cannon. The French were able to withdraw unopposed by the Corsican forces, which were reportedly distracted by looting the bodies of French soldiers killed in the bombardment.Gregory, p.54 The French retired over the Serra Mountains to Bastia, establishing defensive positions en route at Tichime, a mountain on the road between the towns. Linzee's squadron meanwhile anchored in San Fiorenzo Bay and seized the wreck of Minerve, which was later successfully raised, repaired and joined the Royal Navy under the same name. The French expected that they would have to conduct a fighting retreat, and preparations were begun to abandon Bastia. Dundas sent Corsican forces to probe the defences, and these troops skirmished with French outposts in the highlands, but he then withdrew them due to the freezing conditions.Gregory, p.54 Captain Horatio Nelson had landed a force of sailors to reconnoitre the town on 19 February, returning an optimistic report on its state of readiness.Mostert, p.122 However, on 23 February the French abandoned their preparations to leave and set about strengthening the town's defences. Dundas then decided not to move on Bastia until reinforcements had arrived from Britain, and withdrew his forces entirely to the outskirts of San Fiorenzo.Bennett, p.35 Hood disagreed with the order, and attempted to undermine Dundas by appealing to his deputies Moore and Lieutenant Colonel William Villettes. This was a breach of the chain of command and Moore informed Dundas. Dundas was furious, and on 11 March he resigned his commission and handed command of land forces to Colonel Abraham D'Aubant.Gregory, p.56 The Siege of Bastia began in earnest in April 1794, with combined blockade and bombardment lasting six weeks before the city surrendered.Bennett, p.37 This left only Calvi as the remaining French-held town in Corsica, which was besieged by a reinforced British and Corsican force in July and surrendered a month later after a massive bombardment.James, p.191 Corsica was annexed to the British Empire as a self-governing kingdom, but was evacuated only two years later following the Treaty of San Ildefonso and the declaration of war on Britain by the Kingdom of Spain.Clowes, p.288 The siege had an unusual legacy; the Torra di Mortella had gained some notoriety in Britain for its fight against Fortitude, and had been sketched by Royal Engineers after the siege. In 1804, during the early stages of the Napoleonic Wars, there were fears of French efforts to invade Britain, and these sketches were rediscovered and more than a hundred towers ordered to an adapted design to be built along the south and east coasts of Britain. Known as Martello Towers due to a garbled translation, by the time they were completed the invasion threat was over.Gardiner, p.101 Notes References Bibliography   1794 in France Sieges of the French Revolutionary Wars Conflicts in 1794 Sieges involving Great Britain Sieges involving France Battles of the War of the First Coalition San Fiorenzo ","title":"Siege of San Fiorenzo"},{"id":"30267815","title":"My Dream (Thomas song)"},{"id":"30267837","text":"Donny Fernando Siregar or Donny Siregar is an Indonesian footballer who currently plays for PSMS Medan as a midfielder.

The relationship between the two countries has been severed following the Qatar diplomatic crisis. Both countries share a naval border and are part of the Arabic-speaking Persian Gulf region. They are both members of the GCC. On 5 June 2017, UAE cut diplomatic relations with Qatar, giving the country's diplomats 48 hours to leave the country. Diplomatic visits = Visits by Qatar = In March 2016, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani visited Abu Dhabi and met with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. = Visits by United Arab Emirates = In 2008, the president of the UAE, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, visited Doha where he met Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, Amir of Qatar. The two leaders set up a joint investment fund. In 28 November 2014, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, crown prince of Abu Dhabi, visited Doha and met with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. History = Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani Coup d'√©tat = In 1995, after Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani deposed his father to become emir of Qatar, UAE granted asylum to the deposed Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani in a quarters in Abu Dhabi. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan tried to mediate between the father and his son, and advised Khalifa bin Hamad to congratulate his son. The coup affair was revived in 2018 after the Qatar diplomatic crisis with Al Jazeera broadcasting documentaries of new details accusing UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt, of plotting to overthrow Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and reinstating his father Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani. According to Al Jazeera, a former French army commander Paul Barril was contracted and supplied with weapons by the UAE to carry out the coup operation in Qatar. UAE minister of foreign affairs Anwar Gargash responded to the documentary and stated that Paul Barril was in fact a security agent of Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani who visited Abu Dhabi and had no relationship with the UAE and the documentary was a falsification to inculpate the UAE. = 2014 Riyadh Agreement = The UAE, along with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, withdrew their ambassador from Qatar in March 2014 due to alleged failure by Qatar to abide by an agreement not to interfere in the politics of these countries. The main reason for the dispute was UAE's support for the political regime in Egypt led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Egypt‚Äôs military elite which contrasted Qatar's support for the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood. The government of Qatar continued to back the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, and Qatar's emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani denounced el-Sisi's election as president in June 2014 as a ‚Äòmilitary coup‚Äô. The ambassadors returned to their posts in June. In September 2014, it was reported that the Emirati government invested $3 mn into a lobbying campaign against Qatar, primarily as a response to Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood. The campaign was aimed at influencing American journalists to publish critical articles of Qatar's alleged funding of Islamist groups. Qatar has also been accused of influencing news outlets to report unfavorably on the UAE. It was claimed by journalist Brian Whitaker that the UAE used Global Network for Rights and Development, an NGO to which it has ties, as a political tool. Whitaker claimed that the organization showed favoritism in its 2014 human rights index by ranking UAE at 14 and Qatar at 97. The organization has also taken an opposing stance towards Qatar's hosting of the 2022 FIFA World Cup over human rights concerns. Two of the organization's employees were arrested by Qatari authorities in 2014 while they were investigating the living standards of foreign laborers. = Libyan Civil War = The second Libyan Civil War has been described as a proxy conflict between the two countries, with the UAE backing the secular Tobruk government and Qatar backing the Islamist National Salvation Government. = 2017‚Äì19 Qatar diplomatic crisis = On 5 June 2017, the UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain, severed ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. This was precipitated by messages being inserted into a broadcast by the Qatar News Agency in May 2017 which criticized Saudi Arabia and cast Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood in a positive light. Qatar denied that it was responsible for the messages, claiming that its news agency was hacked. As a result, the four aforementioned countries censored all Qatari news outlets. In addition to severing ties on 5 June, the UAE also expelled all Qatari nationals living in the Emirates and prohibited its citizens from travelling to Qatar. Furthermore, the UAE closed off its airspace and territorial waters to Qatari vessels. Islam Hassan argues \\"there has been always competition between al-Nahyans of Abu Dhabi and al-Thanis of Qatar. This competition goes back to the 1800s. The Arab uprisings ushered a new chapter in the Qatari‚ÄìEmirati competition. The competition led to the Emiratis playing a major role in the withdrawal of ambassadors from Qatar in 2014. At the beginning of the current diplomatic crisis, particularly after the hacking saga, UAE was trying to maintain the problem. Yet, Al Jazeera's publishing of Yousuf al-Otaiba's leaked emails got the UAE on board with Saudi Arabia.\\" In two separate incidents, on 21 December 2017 and 3 January 2018, the UAE was accused by Qatar's government of infringing on its airspace with fighter jets. As a result, two complaints were filed to the UN by Qatar's representative Alya bint Ahmed Al Thani. For their part, the UAE rebuked the allegations, claiming that it had never impeached on Qatar's airspace with warplanes. On 14 January, Qatari Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali Al-Thani, who had been touted by Saudi Arabia and the UAE as a potential replacement for Qatar's current emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, reportedly released a video in which he claimed he was being detained in the UAE by Emirati authorities after being invited to the country by Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Emirati authorities denied that he was being forcefully held. Another air traffic-related incident occurred on 15 January 2018, when the UAE accused Qatar of 'intercepting' two civilian airliners en route to Bahrain with fighter jets. This was quickly denied by Qatari government officials. During the 2019 Asian Cup semifinal match between Qatar and the tournament host United Arab Emirates, the UAE supporters threw bottles and footwears into the pitch. This conduct was preceded by booing the Qatari national anthem. Qatar won 4‚Äì0 despite the situation, paving way to their first Asian Cup final and eventual title. On 12 November 2019, the UAE decided to participate in the 24th Arabian Gulf Cup, which is being hosted by Qatar, after boycotting it earlier. According to analysts, the participation from the UAE signaled that the feud between the countries might come to an end soon. Energy Qatar, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates are linked by the Dolphin Gas Project, which is the Gulf Cooperation Council's first cross- border refined gas transmission project. The project is developed and operated by Dolphin Energy, a company established in Abu Dhabi. It is the operator of all upstream, midstream, and downstream phases of the project. Dolphin Energy is 51% owned by Mubadala Development Company, on behalf of the Government of Abu Dhabi, and 24.5% each owned by Total S.A. of France and Occidental Petroleum of the United States. Despite the Qatar diplomatic crisis and the severing of relations between the two countries, there are no plans to shut down the pipeline. In March 2019, Qatar lodged a complaint to International Atomic Energy Agency regarding the United Arab Emirates Barakah nuclear power plant, stating that it poses a serious threat to regional stability and the environment. The UAE denied that there are safety issues with the plant, which is being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), and stated ‚ÄúThe United Arab Emirates ... adheres to its commitment to the highest standards of nuclear safety, security and non-proliferation.‚Äù References United Arab Emirates Bilateral relations of the United Arab Emirates ","title":"Qatar‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates relations"},{"id":"30267879","text":"The Manishtushu Obelisk is a diorite, four-sided stele.

United Arab Emirates‚ÄìUnited Kingdom relations are the relations between the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UAE has an embassy in London while the UK maintains an embassy in Abu Dhabi and is unique in having another Embassy in Dubai, albeit with Her Britannic Majesty's Consul-General to Dubai and the Northern Emirates, as opposed to a separate British Ambassador. The UAE-UK relations have been described as a \\"special relationship\\".  History  Before the country's formation in 1971, the emirates which currently constitute the UAE were once all part of the Trucial States and independent sheikhdoms allied with the United Kingdom, assigned as British protectorates by the General Maritime Treaty of 1820. The main purpose of this relationship was to ensure the passage to British India, by excluding the pirates who then raided the country's coast on the Persian Gulf. An agreement between the British and the ruler of Sharjah in 1932 led to the construction of a fortified airfield known as Al Mahatta Fort, to allow a stop on the Imperial Airways route to Brisbane, Australia. Royal Air Force aircraft were subsequently allowed to refuel at Sharjah in World War II. Al Mahatta Museum is a reminder of the BOAC (formerly Imperial Airways) and other flights that used to frequent the UAE's first airport.  Inward visits  In November 2010, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II made an historic visit to His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, her first since 1979, when she also visited Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. During the 1979 visit she opened a number of ports and buildings including the Dubai World Trade Center, Dubai Municipality and Port Rashid. On her second visit in 2010, The Queen spent 2 days touring the Zayed Museum and visiting dignitaries of the Ruling Family, whilst her Secretary of State for Foreign & Commonwealth Affairs (The Rt. Hon. William Hague) signed the Abu Dhabi Declaration 2010 with His Highness Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE Minister of Foreign Affairs, reaffirming the 1971 friendship treaty between the two nations. His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh also signed a Memorandum of Understanding in his role as Chancellor of Cambridge University with His Highness Sheikh Nahyan Bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, UAE Minister of Education.  Economic ties  The Secretary of State for Foreign & Commonwealth Affairs noted upon signing Abu Dhabi 2010 in the presence of Her Majesty and His Highness Sheikh Khalifa that 100,000 British citizens lived in the Emirates and over a million visited each year for business and leisure. Beside this each country share consistently high rates of mutual trade and investment.  Political ties  Both Great Britain and the Emirates have historic association in terms of co-operation in the areas of law enforcement, defence, training and military technology. This was reflected recently in the signing of an agreement to co-operate in the development of the Emirates' own nuclear energy plants in the future. In November 2018, the United Kingdom foreign minister Jeremy Hunt threatened the UAE with \\"serious diplomatic consequences\\" after it sentenced a British academic Matthew Hedges to life in prison for allegedly spying for the UK government.  People  Well-known Britons include Edward Henderson, who wrote a book \\"Arabian Destiny\\" on his career in the region after World War Two developing oil concessions and learning about local politics both within and beyond his role in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office. Uniquely on his retirement he was invited to assist in establishing the national archives in Abu Dhabi by His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, founding President of the UAE from 1971 and Ruler of Abu Dhabi prior to then. Other well-known authors with experience of the Emirates include Shirley Kay \\"Mother Without a Mask\\" and Jeremy Williams OBE \\"Don't They Know It's Friday?\\". An 18th century masterpiece painting, titled ‚ÄòMary Magdalene in Ecstasy‚Äô, was gifted to the UAE by the United Kingdom as a token of goodwill and a symbol of enduring friendship between both countries on July 2019. The painting was painted bu Ary Scheffer in 1856 and is from the Lubin Family Private Collection. The painting was presented by the British Ambassador to the UAE Patrick Moody to Dr Hamed bin Mohamed Al Suwaidi, the chairman of Abu Dhabi Arts Society.

It is located on the north shore of the Peace River at the terminus of Garden River Road, an extension of Highway 58, approximately east of the Town of High Level. It is a First Nations community of the Little Red River Cree Nation.  History  Lying 5 kilometers inside the original 1922 boundary of Wood Buffalo National Park, this predominantly First Nations community was never officially recognized by the federal government, until a special amendment to the Canada National Parks Act removed the community from the park on June 19, 2017. Corresponding orders-in-council from the provincial government of Alberta are expected to facilitate the creation of a new Indian reserve encompassing Garden River's territory. This would become the third reserve of the Little Red River Cree Nation, after Fox Lake 162 and John D'Or Prairie 215.  Demographics  The population of Garden River according to the Little Red River Cree Nation is 483.

In 2015, he was replaced as managing director of IPIC and later investigated in a series of probes into misappropriated funds in connection with 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He was arrested in the United Arab Emirates in 2016 as part of investigations into the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal. In 2019, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for corruption and money laundering. Life and education Qubaisi was born in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates in 1971. He graduated from the University of the United Arab Emirates with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1993. He is married, and has four children.  Career  In 1993, after graduating from university, Qubaisi joined the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), where he went on to become a senior financial analyst in the North American Equities Department. In 2000, he became an investment manager at International Petroleum Investment Company. In May 2007, he became managing director, and in 2011, he took the additional position as chairman of IPIC's subsidiary, Compa√±√≠a Espa√±ola de Petr√≥leos. He was chairman of many other companies including NOVA Chemicals, Arabtec, Borealis AG and OMV (in both of which IPIC owns a controlling interest), Aabar Investments (an IPIC subsidiary), Falcon Private Bank, Abu Dhabi National Takaful Company, and Hakkasan Group. He was the director of Tasameem Real Estate Co. LLC, the investment company of Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and chairman of IPIC. Qubaisi also served on the board of Bahrain's First Energy Bank. During his time at IPIC, Qubaisi was involved in several major deals, including the 2008 bailout of Barclays. In April 2015, Qubaisi was removed from his role as managing director of the International Petroleum Investment Company. He resigned from or was replaced in his other positions in the following months. Controversy Qubaisi was replaced as managing director of the International Petroleum Investment Company in April 2015. Following his dismissal from IPIC, he resigned or was replaced from most of his corporate roles in companies controlled by IPIC. In September of that year, a Malaysian investigative website Sarawak Report linked his dismissal to corruption allegations stemming from transactions IPIC undertook with 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a strategic development company that became the subject of controversy when Malaysia's prime minister was accused of using it to siphon money into his personal bank accounts. In 2015, IPIC had given 1MDB $1 billion, and taken on $3.5 billion of their debt in return for some of 1MDB's assets. In April 2016, Reuters reported that the United Arab Emirates central bank had ordered banks in the UAE to freeze and provide transaction information on bank accounts belonging to Qubaisi or Mohamed al-Husseiny, another IPIC senior official. Officials investigating misappropriated funds in connection with 1MDB said that a total of $2.4 billion that was intended to be transferred from 1MDB to Aabar Investments was instead sent to a different company, established in the British Virgin Islands by Qubaisi and al-Husseiny, called Aabar Investments PJS Ltd. This company is under investigation by the United Arab Emirates to determine if it was used as a conduit for 1MDB funds. On 20 July 2016, United States federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit to seize over $1 billion in assets believed to have been stolen from 1MDB. Qubaisi was named in these lawsuits, along with al-Husseiny and several others, which added that the funds were used to purchase these assets as well as \\"fund the co-conspirators' lavish lifestyles.\\" This lawsuit is noted to be the largest forfeiture complaint filed in United States history. In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qubaisi was being forced by the Emirati authorities to give away his assets to Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan's privately owned company. Post his arrest, in an interview, Qubaisi said he was being blamed as a ‚Äúscapegoat‚Äù by Sheikh Mansour. ‚ÄúI did this deal but I did it on behalf of the government of Abu Dhabi.

Biography Fok graduated from the Konstantinovskoe Artillery School in St. Petersburg in 1864, and from 1871-1876 served in the Special Corps of Gendarmes, an elite uniformed security police force responsible for state security. From 1877-1878, he saw combat in the Russo-Turkish War. From 1900, Fok was commander of the 4th East Siberian Rifle Brigade, and participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 121. During the Russo-Japanese War, Fok commanded the 4th East Siberian Rifle Division stationed at Port Arthur. He was noted for his precipitous retreat and failure to reinforce Colonel Nikolai Tretyakov at the Battle of Nanshan, leading directly to the Russian defeat. He was relieved of command on 21 August 1904 for refusing direct orders to send reserves forward to reinforce faltering Russian lines at the fortification of East Panlung and West Panlung during the Siege of Port Arthur. However, he remained on the staff of General Anatoly Stessel, who insisted on naming Fok commander of the landward defenses of Port Arthur and promoting him to lieutenant general after the death of General Roman Kondratenko. Nozhin, Lindsay, Swinton, The Truth about Port Arthur, p. 280 Fok was further awarded the Order of St. George (3rd degree) in October 1904. As commander, Fok constantly refused to commit reserves or reinforcements to front-line units, and after eight months of the siege was one of the first to urge acceptance of the surrender terms extended by Japanese general Nogi Maresuke at the end of 1904. Taken as a prisoner of war by the Japanese after the fall of Port Arthur, Fok returned to Russia after the end of the war. Faced with strong public criticism, he was arrested and brought before a court martial in late 1906 on his return, but was acquitted and released from military service in 1908. Fok retired from service, but later participated in the Balkan War of 1912-1913 as a volunteer in the Bulgarian Army. He died in 1926 under uncertain circumstances, and according to his wish was buried in a mass grave outside Svishtov in Bulgaria.

Biography Victor Galway was born in Colchester, Essex, England. He attended Ayr Academy and studied organ under Frederick Ely. In 1911 he emigrated with his family to Australia, where he studied music at the University of Melbourne. He graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1916, and in 1923 became the university's first student to complete the requirements for the Doctor of Music degree. In 1919 Galway moved to Dunedin, New Zealand, to take up the position of organist and choirmaster at First Church of Otago. He became the first lecturer in music at the University of Otago in 1925, and the first Blair Professor of Music at the university in 1939. That year he also left his post at First Church to become organist and choirmaster at St. Paul's Cathedral, Dunedin. Galway also served as conductor of the Dunedin Choral Society, conductor of the Otago University Musical Society, and president of the Otago Society of Musicians. Most of his compositions were for choral music, and several of his pieces were published by Oxford University Press. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. Galway suffered a stroke in 1954 and shortly afterwards retired from the University of Otago. He died at Cherry Farm Hospital, near Dunedin, on 9 July 1960, survived by his daughter. His wife Janette, whom he married in 1917, predeceased him. References *Campbell, Margaret. Music in Dunedin.

Vacant lots were purchased by an Armstrong owned company that operated the Maysville cotton mill. The company continued to operate as the January & Wood Company until 2003. Armstrong also developed a number of other row house projects in Maysville including the Federal style row houses on Limestone Street, Mechanic's Row, and the \\"Allen Block\\". The Armstrong Row houses are two story brick with gable roofs and stepped parapet walls in both Federal and Greek Revival style. The facade is Flemish bond and sides are common bond. Although similar in construction, the gable roofs vary in pitch suggesting the buildings were constructed either by more than one builder or over a period of time. John Armstrong was born in Ireland in 1779 and emigrated to America with his family circa 1790. He bought his first Maysville property in 1800 from Jacob Boone, a first cousin of Daniel Boone. He later operated several wholesale houses on front street becoming wealthy in the process. Armstrong was instrumental in the early development of the city and was the first to sign a petition to move the county seat from Washington to Maysville. He was a member of the company responsible for building the Maysville and Lexington Turnpike, he established the first bank in Kentucky in Maysville in 1818, and was a member of the committee that welcomed General Lafayette to Maysville in an 1825 visit.

Overview General relativity is a highly nonlinear model, and as such, its 3+1D version is usually too complicated to analyze in detail. In 3+1D and higher, propagating gravitational waves exist, but not in 2+1D or 1+1D. In 2+1D, general relativity becomes a topological field theory with no local degrees of freedom, and all 1+1D models are locally flat. However, a slightly more complicated generalization of general relativity which includes dilatons will turn the 2+1D model into one admitting mixed propagating dilaton-gravity waves, as well as making the 1+1D model geometrically nontrivial locally. The 1+1D model still does not admit any propagating gravitational (or dilaton) degrees of freedom, but with the addition of matter fields, it becomes a simplified, but still nontrivial model. With other numbers of dimensions, a dilaton-gravity coupling can always be rescaled away by a conformal rescaling of the metric, converting the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame. But not in two dimensions, because the conformal weight of the dilaton is now 0. The metric in this case is more amenable to analytical solutions than the general 3+1D case. And of course, 0+1D models cannot capture any nontrivial aspect of relativity because there is no space at all. This class of models retains just enough complexity to include among its solutions black holes, their formation, FRW cosmological models, gravitational singularities, etc. In the quantized version of such models with matter fields, Hawking radiation also shows up, just as in higher-dimensional models.  Action  A very specific choice of couplings and interactions leads to the CGHS model. :S = frac{1}{2pi} int d^2x, sqrt{-g}left{ e^{-2phi} left[ R + 4left( ablaphi right)^2 + 4lambda^2 right] - sum^N_{i=1} frac{1}{2}left( abla f_i right)^2 right} where g is the metric tensor, phi is the dilaton field, fi are the matter fields, and Œª2 is the cosmological constant. In particular, the cosmological constant is nonzero, and the matter fields are massless real scalars. This specific choice is classically integrable, but still not amenable to an exact quantum solution. It is also the action for Non-critical string theory and dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional model. It also distinguishes it from Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Liouville gravity, which are entirely different models. The matter field only couples to the causal structure, and in the light-cone gauge , has the simple generic form :f_ileft( u, v right) = A_ileft( u right) + B_i left( v right), with a factorization between left- and right-movers. The Raychaudhuri equations are :e^{-2phi} left( - 2phi_{,vv} + 4 rho_{,v}phi_{,v} right) + f_{i,v}f_{i,v}/2= 0 and :e^{-2phi} left( - 2phi_{,uu} + 4 rho_{,u}phi_{,u} right) + f_{i,u}f_{i,u}/2= 0. The dilaton evolves according to :left( e^{-2phi} right)_{,uv} = - lambda^2 e^{-2phi}e^{2rho}, while the metric evolves according to :2rho_{,uv} - 4phi_{,uv} + 4phi_{,u}phi_{,v} + lambda^2 e^{2rho} = 0. The conformal anomaly due to matter induces a Liouville term in the effective action. = Black hole = A vacuum black hole solution is given by :ds^2 = - left( frac{M}{lambda} - lambda^2 uv right)^{-1} du, dv :e^{-2phi} = frac{M}{lambda} - lambda^2 uv, where M is the ADM mass. Singularities appear at . The masslessness of the matter fields allow a black hole to completely evaporate away via Hawking radiation. In fact, this model was originally studied to shed light upon the black hole information paradox.

She was also the mother of the second Tokugawa sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Hidetada. Her contributions were considered so significant that she was posthumously inducted to the Senior First Rank of the Imperial Court, the highest honor that could be conferred by the Emperor of Japan. During their relationship, Lady Saig≈ç influenced Ieyasu's philosophies, choice of allies, and policies as he rose to power during the late Sengoku period, and she thus had an indirect effect on the organization and composition of the Tokugawa shogunate. Although less is known of her than some other figures of the era, she is generally regarded as the \\"power behind the throne\\", and her life has been compared to a \\"Cinderella story\\" of feudal Japan.Mochida (2000‚Äì2013). Once she was in a respected and secure position as first consort and mother to Ieyasu's heir, Lady Saig≈ç used her influence and wealth for charitable purposes. A devout Buddhist, she donated money to temples in Suruga Province, where she resided as the consort of Ieyasu, first in Hamamatsu Castle and later in Sunpu Castle. As she was quite near-sighted, she also established a charitable organization that assisted visually impaired women with no other means of support. Lady Saig≈ç died at a fairly young age, under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Although murder was suspected, no culprit was identified. Lady Saig≈ç bore four children: she had a son and a daughter (Saig≈ç Katsutada and Tokuhime) while married, and she later bore two sons as the consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu: Tokugawa Hidetada and Matsudaira Tadayoshi. Among the descendants of Lady Saig≈ç was the Empress Meish≈ç (1624‚Äì1696), one of very few women to accede to the Chrysanthemum Throne as empress regnant. Name The term \\"Saig≈ç-no- Tsubone\\", used in most historical texts, is an official title rather than a name. As an adult she was adopted into the Saig≈ç clan, so she was permitted to use the surname. Later, when she was named first consort of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the title \\"tsubone\\" (pronounced ) was appended to the surname. The title was one of several titular suffixes conferred on high-ranking women (others include -kata and -dono). The bestowal of a title depended on social class and the relationship with her samurai lord, such as whether she was a legitimate wife or a concubine, and whether or not she had had children by him.Downer (2008).Hata (2008), pp. 172‚Äì90, 175‚Äì78. The word tsubone indicates the living quarters reserved for ladies of a court,Griffis (1915), p. 88. and it became the title for those who had been granted private quarters, such as high- ranking concubines with children. This title, tsubone, was in use for concubines from the Heian period until the Meiji period (from the eighth century to the early twentieth century),Akiyama (1990) and is commonly translated to the English title \\"Lady\\".Murdoch (1996), p. 3. Though Lady Saig≈ç's given name does not appear in surviving documents from the time, there is good evidence it was Masako (), but this name is very rarely used. Her most commonly used name was Oai ( or , meaning \\"love\\") and most sources agree this was a nickname she gained as a child.H≈çdai-in (2010).Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 392.Hyodo et al. (2007), p. 546.Nakashima (1999), p. 79.Nihon (2007), pp. 78‚Äì79. Intimate friends and family would call her Oai throughout her life, and it is the name most often used in modern popular cultural references. Following death, she was bestowed with a Buddhist posthumous name, and an abbreviation of that name, H≈çdai-in (), is sometimes used out of pious respect. Background The Saig≈ç family was one branch of the distinguished Kikuchi clan of Kyushu that had migrated northward to Mikawa Province in the fifteenth century. In 1524, the forces of Matsudaira Kiyoyasu (1511‚Äì1536), the grandfather of Tokugawa Ieyasu, stormed and took the Saig≈ç clan's headquarters at Yamanaka Castle during his conquest of the Mikawa region. Shortly after the battle, Saig≈ç Nobusada, the third head of the Saig≈ç, submitted to the Matsudaira clan.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 610. Following the untimely death of Kiyoyasu in 1536, and the ineffectual leadership and early death of Matsudaira Hirotada (1526‚Äì1549), the leaderless Matsudaira clan finally submitted to Imagawa Yoshimoto (1519‚Äì1560) of Suruga Province, east of Mikawa. When the Matsudaira fell to the Imagawa, the clans of their retainers, which included the Saig≈ç, likewise submitted to the Imagawa. Following the Battle of Okehazama (1560), Saig≈ç Masakatsu attempted to re-assert the independence of the clan while yielding some land concessions to the Imagawa. In response, Imagawa Ujizane arrested thirteen Saig≈ç men, and had them vertically impaled near Yoshida Castle.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 612. The executions did not deter the Saig≈ç, and in 1562 the Imagawa launched punitive invasions of east Mikawa and attacked the two main Saig≈ç castles. Masakatsu was killed in the battle of Gohonmatsu Castle; his eldest son Motomasa was killed during the battle for Wachigaya Castle. Clan leadership passed to Masakatsu's son, Saig≈ç Kiyokazu (1533‚Äì1594), who pledged his loyalty to the Matsudaira clan, under the leadership of Tokugawa Ieyasu, in their mutual struggle against the Imagawa. In 1569, the power of the Imagawa ended with the Siege of Kakegawa Castle.Sadler (1937), p. 73.Zenkoku (2000), p. 122. Neither the name of Lady Saig≈ç's mother nor her dates of birth or death are recorded in any existing documents, although it is known that she was the elder sister of Saig≈ç Kiyokazu.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 394. Lady Saig≈ç's father was Tozuka Tadaharu of T≈çt≈çmi Province, under direct control of the Imagawa clan. The marriage between Tadaharu and his wife was very likely arranged by the Imagawa clan. Biography =Early life= Lady Saig≈ç was born in 1552 at Nishikawa Castle, a branch castle of the Saig≈ç clan,Aichi (1998), p. 101. and very likely given the name of Masako soon after birth. Japanese marriages are not usually matrilocal,Ueno (2009), pp. 199‚Äì201. but Tadaharu may have been assigned to Nishikawa Castle as an agent of the Imagawa. Masako spent her childhood with her two siblings in bucolic eastern Mikawa Province, and at some point gained the nickname Oai. In 1554, her father Tadaharu died in the Battle of Enshu-Omori, between the Imagawa and the H≈çj≈ç clan.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 399. Two years later her mother married Hattori Masanao; the union resulted in four children, though only two survived to adulthood.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p .393.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 395. Some sources state that upon reaching \\"adulthood\\" Oai married, but was widowed soon afterward. The husband's name is not mentioned and there were apparently no children. Other sources do not mention the marriage, or suggest that there never was an earlier \\"first\\" marriage. It is known with certainty that in 1567, Oai married Saig≈ç Yoshikatsu, her cousin and the son of Motomasa, who had already had two children by his late wife.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 398. Oai bore two children by Yoshikatsu: their son, Saig≈ç Katsutada, was born about 1570; they also had a daughter, possibly named Tokuhime.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 373.Nakashima (1999), p. 91. In 1571, Saig≈ç Yoshikatsu was killed at the Battle of Takehiro, fighting the invading forces of the Takeda clan led by Akiyama Nobutomo.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 372. Soon after Yoshikatsu's death, Oai was formally adopted by her uncle, Saig≈ç Kiyokazu, then the head of the Saig≈ç clan, though she chose to live with her mother in the house of her stepfather. =Tokugawa Ieyasu= Tokugawa Ieyasu Oai first met Tokugawa Ieyasu at about the age of 17 or 18, when he visited the Saig≈ç family and Oai served him tea.Nakashima (1999), p. 80. It is believed she caught his eye on that occasion, but as she was still married, nothing came of it at the time. Later, during the 1570s, it is believed that friendship and genuine affection developed between the two. This view contradicts a common impression which maintains that Ieyasu was a ruthless leader who treated all the women in his life, and all of his offspring, as commodities to be used as needed to serve the clan or his own ambitions.Sadler (1937), p. 284. However, it is also known that he valued personal merit over bloodlines. During this time, Ieyasu had a house built in eastern Mikawa, far from the residence of his wife, the Lady Tsukiyama, in Okazaki.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 400.Sadler (1937), p. 75. The marriage between Ieyasu and Lady Tsukiyama had been arranged by her uncle, Imagawa Yoshimoto, ostensibly to help cement ties between the two clans, though Ieyasu found it difficult to live with his wife's jealousy, tempestuous moods, and eccentric habits.Sadler (1937), pp. 75, 92.Totman (1983), p. 32. Starting around the time of the Battle of Mikatagahara (1573), perhaps in its aftermath, Ieyasu began to confide in Oai and sought her counsel on various matters. It may have been during this period that the two commenced an amorous relationship. Oai is credited with advising Ieyasu as the Battle of Nagashino (1575) approached, a major turning point in both Ieyasu's career and the history of Japan.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 384. It is also thought that Ieyasu continued to seek her advice concerning other battles and alliances, even as late as the Komaki- Nagakute Campaign (1584). In the spring of 1578, Oai moved to Hamamatsu Castle, where she took over management of the kitchen. She became very popular with the unit of warriors from her native province, who not only admired her beauty, but regarded her as a gentle and virtuous example of the women of Mikawa. While her manners and gentility were exemplary, she could, when the occasion warranted, be outspoken or sarcastic in speech, the probable result of growing up around rustic warriors in a remote castle outpost. With her move to the court of Ieyasu, Oai entered a bitter arena where prospective concubines schemed and competed with each other for a chance to bear Ieyasu's child. Bearing the child of a powerful samurai, especially a son, was one way an ambitious young woman of the period could elevate her status, ensure a comfortable life, and guarantee the prosperity of her family.Beard (1953), pp. 4, 8. These women usually relied on their physical attributes and sexual prowess to keep their lord's attention, and some resorted to the use of aphrodisiacs. Unlike these courtesans, Oai already had the attention of Ieyasu, which would have undermined the ambitions of some and very likely made her a target of resentment, hostility, and the intrigues that were common in Japanese harems.Levy (1971), p. 39. Tokugawa Hidetada, son of Ieyasu and Lady Saig≈ç While Ieyasu's marriage was arranged for political reasons, and many of his later concubines were chosen in the same spirit, it is thought that he chose his relationship with Lady Saig≈ç. Despite the image of Ieyasu as a calculating and stoic warlord, there was no new political advantage to the match, as the Saig≈ç were already loyal vassals, and thus texts about Lady Saig≈ç refer to her as the \\"most beloved\\" of Ieyasu's women. Moreover, Ieyasu valued her for her intelligence and sound advice and it is believed that he enjoyed her company and calm demeanor as well as their common background in Mikawa province. On May 2, 1579, Oai gave birth to Ieyasu's third son, who would become known as Tokugawa Hidetada. The news was probably a shock to all who had an interest in Ieyasu, but with the event, Oai's position became more secure and she was accepted as the first consort of Ieyasu. Based on this relationship, and out of respect for her gentle manner and devotion to Ieyasu, she became known by the respectful title of Saig≈ç-no-Tsubone, or Lady Saig≈ç.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 614. In the same year, Oda Nobunaga was informed that Lady Tsukiyama had conspired against him with the Takeda clan. Although evidence was weak, Ieyasu re-assured his ally by having his wife executed by the shore of Lake Sanaru in Hamamatsu.Sadler (1937), p. 94. Tokugawa Nobuyasu, Ieyasu's first son by Lady Tsukiyama, was held in confinement until Ieyasu ordered him to commit seppuku. With their deaths, Lady Saig≈ç's position at court was unassailable. With the death of Nobuyasu, Hidetada became Ieyasu's heir apparent.Griffis (1883), p. 272.Sadler (1937), p. 141. Ieyasu's fourth son, the second by Lady Saig≈ç, was born on October 18, 1580. He would become known as Matsudaira Tadayoshi, after he was adopted by Matsudaira Ietada, the head of the Fuk≈çzu branch of the Matsudaira clan.Totman (1983), p. 191. In the same year, Lady Saig≈ç had a temple founded in her mother's memory, indicating she had died by that point. In 1586, Lady Saig≈ç was at the side of Ieyasu when he entered the newly reconstructed Sunpu Castle in triumph. This was a highly symbolic celebration of his victories over his enemies and the subjugation of the region, but it was also a visible and symbolic gesture to Lady Saig≈ç, a way that Ieyasu could credit her for her assistance, and publicly demonstrate the esteem in which he regarded her. =Charity= While at Sunpu Castle, Lady Saig≈ç worshipped at a Buddhist temple called Ry≈´sen-ji (). She became devoted to the teachings of the Pure Land sect and was known for her piety and charity. Because she suffered a high degree of myopia, she often donated money, clothing, food, and other necessities to blind women and organizations that assisted them. She eventually founded a co-operative school with living quarters near Ry≈´sen-ji that assisted indigent blind women by teaching them how to play the shamisen (traditional stringed instrument) as a vocation, and helped them to find employment. These women were known as goze, and were akin to traveling minstrels in Edo period Japan.Fritsch (2002).Groemer (2001). The women were granted membership to the guild-like organization, and musicians with apprentices were dispatched to various destinations. They played pieces from a sanctioned repertoire, and operated under a strict code of rules on behavior and permissible business transactions intended to maintain an upstanding reputation. On her deathbed, Lady Saig≈ç wrote a letter pleading for the continued maintenance of the organization.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 402. =Death= Grave of Lady Saig≈ç Within a short time after taking up residence in Sunpu Castle, Lady Saig≈ç's health began to deteriorate. It was said that \\"physical and emotional hardships\\" were taking their toll on her health, but nothing could be done to help her. Lady Saig≈ç died on July 1, 1589, at the age of 37. The cause of her early death was never determined, and while murder was suspected at the time, no culprit was identified. There were later rumors that she was poisoned by a maidservant devoted to Ieyasu's late wife, the Lady Tsukiyama.Nakashima (1999), p. 81. By the time of her death, Lady Saig≈ç was treated as Ieyasu's wife in deed if not in word.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 411. The remains of Lady Saig≈ç were interred at Ry≈´sen-ji. At her death, a number of blind women reportedly gathered in front of the temple and prayed.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 408. Legacy Tokugawa Ieyasu continued his campaigns allied with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After their victory at the Siege of Odawara Castle in 1590, Ieyasu agreed to relinquish all of his domains to Hideyoshi in exchange for the Kant≈ç region to the east.Sadler (1937), p. 164. Hideyoshi died in 1598. By 1603, Ieyasu had recovered Sunpu Castle and completed his unification of Japan, and had been named sh≈çgun by the Emperor.Titsingh (1834), pp. 405, 409.Sadler (1937), pp. 226‚Äì27. The following year, he had Ry≈´sen-ji moved from Yunoki to K≈çyamachi near Sunpu Castle and attended Buddhist funeral rites conducted in honor of the late Lady Saig≈ç on the anniversary of her death. To mark the occasion, Ieyasu presented the temple priests with the katana he inherited from his father, and a portrait of himself as he looked at the time. These items can still be viewed at the temple in Shizuoka city. In 1628, Tokugawa Hidetada, by then the retired second sh≈çgun, attended ceremonies conducted in honor of his late mother on the anniversary of her death.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 401. These ceremonies were meant to help her spirit achieve buddha status. He also saw to it that she was made the honored tutelary patron of the temple by having her posthumous name changed and the first three characters appended to the name of the temple. Today, the temple Ry≈´sen-ji is known mainly by that appellation, H≈çdai-in (). At the same time, the Emperor Go-Mizunoo conferred the name Minamoto Masako () upon Lady Saig≈ç, in effect posthumously adopting her into the Minamoto clan, the extended family of the Imperial line.Ito (2003), p. 445. The new name was then inducted into the Lower First Rank of the Imperial Court. Her status was later upgraded to Senior First Rank, the highest and most prominent award, then or now, bestowed by the Emperor to a few subjects outside the Imperial family who had significantly and positively affected the history of Japan.Kobayashi and Makino (1994), p. 617. In 1938, the mausoleum of Lady Saig≈ç at H≈çdai-in, which consisted of a five-tiered stupa over her grave and a sanctuary for the veneration of her spirit, was designated an Important Cultural Property. The designation was rescinded after the entire temple complex was destroyed in the Great Shizuoka Fire on January 15, 1940. The stupa remains, though evidence of the damage suffered when it toppled over is plainly visible. Many of the treasures of the temple, including a portrait of Lady Saig≈ç and the sword and portrait bequeathed by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1604, were saved by the priests who flung the objects out of windows and doorways before fleeing the burning temple. The temple was rebuilt using steel-reinforced concrete in 1970. Historical artifacts saved from the fire of 1940 are on display at the new H≈çdai-in temple in Shizuoka city. Notable descendants Lady Saig≈ç was the ancestral mother to the line of sh≈çguns that began with the second Edo-period sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Hidetada, and ended with the seventh, Tokugawa Ietsugu (1709‚Äì1716).Screech (2006), pp. 97‚Äì98. Aside from this, Lady Saig≈ç also became connected to the Imperial line. In 1620, Hidetada's daughter, Tokugawa Masako (1607‚Äì1678), married Emperor Go- Mizunoo and entered the Imperial palace.Ponsonby-Fane (1959), pp. 113‚Äì14.Titsingh (1834), p. 410. As empress consort, Masako helped maintain the Imperial Court, supported the arts, and significantly influenced the next three monarchs: the first was her daughter, and the two that followed, Emperors Go-K≈çmy≈ç and Go-Sai, were sons of Emperor Go-Mizunoo by different concubines.Ponsonby-Fane (1959), pp. 115‚Äì16.Lillehoj (1996). The daughter of Masako, and thus great-granddaughter of Lady Saig≈ç, was Princess Okiko (1624‚Äì1696),Ponsonby-Fane (1959), p. 9. who acceded to the Chrysanthemum Throne in 1629 as Empress Meish≈ç.Frederic and Roth (2002), pp. 256‚Äì57.Titsingh (1834), p. 411. She reigned for fifteen years as the 109th monarch of Japan, the seventh of only eight empresses regnant in the history of Japan, until she abdicated in 1643.Titsingh (1834), pp. 411‚Äì12.Imperial Household Agency (2004).

The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was built in the early 1980s but never went into operation. The Fukushima nuclear disaster gave pause to efforts to revive the plant. There have been proposals in 2009 and 2016 to operate the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant.  The Bataan Nuclear Power Plant  Under a regime of martial law, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos in July 1973 announced the decision to build a nuclear power plant. This was in response to the 1973 oil crisis, as the Middle East oil embargo had put a heavy strain on the Philippine economy, and Marcos believed nuclear power to be the solution to meeting the country's energy demands and decreasing dependence on imported oil. ABS-CBN Interactive Construction on the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant began in 1976. Following the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States, construction on the BNPP was stopped, and a subsequent safety inquiry into the plant revealed over 4,000 defects (not confirmed). Among the issues raised was that it was built near major faults and close to the then dormant Pinatubo volcano. Issues of overpricing, bribery, corruption, mismanagement were also raised. In 2009, a bill was filed in the Philippine House of Representatives to recommission and operate the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant. The cost for rehabilitation was placed at USD 1 billion, to be shouldered by taxpayers through loans and additional charges to consumers.https://www.greenpeace.org/seasia/ph/PageFiles/102369/the-case- against-nuclear-power.pdf The Center for Environmental Concerns-Philippines, No to BNPP Revival, and Advocates of Science and Technology for the People (AGHAM), and the Freedom from Debt Coalition opposed the bill, saying that the nuclear plant was defective and dangerous and harbored technical flaw. Concerns were also raised in the House of Representatives concerning nuclear waste disposal, geological hazards, and unfinished debt payments. The Department of Energy of the Philippines in 2016 revived proposals to operate the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, with the cost for rehabilitating the plant estimated at USD 1 billion. Issues were raised against the plant in the Philippine Senate and by Greenpeace Philippines, No to BNPP, Nuclear Free Bataan Movement, and Balanga (Bataan) Bishop Ruperto Santos regarding corruption, cost, and safety.

It was described by Ureta in 1956, and is known from Argentina and Chile. Adults are day flying and have orange (female) or clear (male) wings with a wingspan of 20‚Äì24 mm. Adults emerge in late summer, and larvae develop during the fall, winter and spring. The species is mostly univoltine, but the presence of some large larvae and pupae during most months indicated some variation. The larva of the species have been found on plants in the genus Gutierrezia, including Gutierrezia solbrigii and Grindelia chiloensis. They have seven instars and are about 24 mm long when fully grown. The larvae enter the plant at the base of the twigs or leaves or sometimes bore directly into the crowns. They are cannibalistic after the second instar and usually only one large larva occurs in a single plant. Larger larvae tunnel in the larger roots and make an exit hole in a large stem. A silken tube is often protruded from the exit hole.

It is native to much of Africa, Asia (Brunei Darussalam, China, India, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines) and parts of Australia. It is an aquatic plant, its frond floating upon the surface of the water. It grows in quiet and slow-moving water bodies, because swift currents and waves break up the plant.Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk At maximum growth rate, it can double its biomass in 1.9 days, with most strains attaining such growth within a week under optimal conditions. A. pinnata is a small fern with a triangular frond measuring up to 2.5 centimeters in length which floats on the water. The frond is made up of many rounded or angular overlapping leaves each 1 or 2 millimeters long. They are green, blue-green, or dark red in color and coated in tiny hairs, giving them a velvety appearance. The hairs make the top surface of the leaf water- repellent, keeping the plant afloat even after being pushed under. A water body may be coated in a dense layer of the plants, which form a velvety mat that crowds out other plants. The hairlike roots extend out into the water. The leaves contain the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which is a symbiont that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere that the fern can use.Sood, A., et al. (2005). Indicators of phosphorus deficiency in Azolla pinnata (Salviniales, Pteridophyta). Acta Botanica Hungarica 47:1-2 197. This gives the fern the ability to grow in habitats that are low in nitrogen. The plant reproduces vegetatively when branches break off the main axis, or sexually when sporocarps on the leaves release spores.Azolla pinnata. Nonindigenous Aquatic Species. USGS It is present in New Zealand as an introduced species and an invasive weed that has crowded out a native relative, Azolla rubra. It is a pest of waterways because its dense mats reduce oxygen in the water.Azolla pinnata. Idaho Agriculture.

Chemical composition and the feeding value of azolla (Azolla pinnata) meal for egg-type chicks. International Journal of Poultry Science 5:2 137.  Applications in environmental studies  Recent studies show the usefulness of Azolla pinnata in remediation of environmental pollutants. There are two main methods for utilising A. pinnata to clean up environmental pollutants. The first method is by adsorption, which required the A. pinnata fronds to be processed into powder and agitated with the wastewater for a fixed duration. The pollutant will adhere to the organic functional groups on the surface of the A. pinnata powder. In adsorption studies, A. pinnata was reported in the remediation of dye wastewater containing methyl violet 2B, malachite green, rhodamine B, acid red 88 and acid blue 25. The second remediation method is phytoremediation, where living A. pinnata is suspended on the surface of the wastewater. A. pinnata was primarily studied due to its high tolerance to environmental pollutants, and ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals. Phytoremediation of industrial wastewater containing heavy metals (such as zinc, lead, ,chromium, mercury, cadmium, copper, arsenic) as well as organic dyes such as methyl violet 2B and malachite green are reported in literature. A.pinnata is also reported to be useful for treating of wastewater (remove nitrogenous waste and phosphorus) of poultry farm.

It begins as a continuation of the German Bundesautobahn 93 on the German-Austrian border near Kiefersfelden/Kufstein and runs via Innsbruck (intersection with the Brenner Autobahn A13) to Zams, where it transitions to the S16 Arlberg expressway (Arlberg Schnellstra√üe). It runs parallel to the River Inn and runs through the Inn Valley fresh air region (Luftsanierungsgebiet).  Importance  The Kufstein‚ÄìInnsbruck section, together with the Brenner Autobahn and the German A93 and A8, form the main transport axis from Munich over the Alps to Verona and Modena. In addition the A12 links Tyrol via the so-called German Corner (Deutsches Eck) to Salzburg and the West Autobahn (A1) to Vienna. The A12 was the first autobahn in Austria that was equipped with an intelligent transportation system. These overhead signs provide information to the motorist on every type of situation (road conditions, traffic, weather, etc.) as well as speed limits. During summer vacation period 2019, every weekend from mid-June to mid-September, on the section around Innsbruck as well as on A13 (Austria) Brenner Autobahn it is not allowed to leave the motorway in case of traffic jams. This measure is a controversial issue. The most important reason is to protect the local population suffering from the consequences of the denser traffic on rural roads leading parallel to the motorway. This kind of evasion traffic leads to another congestions, noise and pollution. On the other hand, local hotel and restaurant owners are worried about forfeits. Furthermore, whoever wants to avoid the traffic jam will find a pretext for his intention to leave the motorway in case of an inquiry by the Austrian police.

Overview Although fruits of the wild bananas (Musa spp.) have large, hard seeds, most edible bananas are seedless. Banana plants are therefore propagated asexually from offshoots. Because these rhizomes are usually free of symptoms even when the plant is infected by F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense, they are a common means by which this pathogen is disseminated. It can also be spread in soil and running water, on farm implements or machinery.Stover, R. H. 1962. Fusarial Wilt (Panama Disease) of Bananas and Other Musa Species. CMI, Kew, Surrey, UK. Panama disease is one of the most destructive plant diseases of modern times. It is believed to have originated in Southeast Asia and was first reported in Australia in 1876.Ploetz, R. C., and Pegg, K. G. 1997. Fusarium wilt of banana and Wallace‚Äôs line: Was the disease originally restricted to his Indo-Malayan region? Australas. Plant Pathol. 26:239-249. By 1950 it had spread to all the banana-producing regions of the world with the exception of some islands in the South Pacific, the Mediterranean, Melanesia and Somalia. Panama disease affects a wide range of banana cultivars; however, it is best known for the damage it caused to a single cultivar in the early export plantations. Before 1960, a total reliance was put on the cultivar 'Gros Michel', and it supplied almost all the export trade. It proved susceptible to the disease and the use of infected rhizomes to establish new plantations caused widespread and severe losses. Some indication of the scale of the losses is demonstrated by the complete eradication of production on of plantation in the Ulua Valley of Honduras between 1940 and 1960. In Suriname, an entire operation of was out of business within eight years and in the Quepos area of Costa Rica, were destroyed in twelve years. Cavendish banana By the middle of the 20th century, resistant cultivars in the 'Cavendish' subgroup were being used as a substitute for 'Gros Michel' in the export trade.Ploetz, R.C., and Pegg, K.G. 1999. Fusarium wilt. pp. 143-159 In: Diseases of Banana, Abaca and Enset. Jones, D. R., ed. CABI Publishing. Wallingford, UK. for a time these cultivars did prove resilient and grew well, and in some areas remain the clones on which the current export trade is based. Unfortunately, in several growing areas in the Eastern Hemisphere, these cultivars are falling to TR4. It was inevitable that this disease would spread to the Western Hemisphere, and indeed in 2019 it was detected in Colombia. This poses a significant threat to production, because there are currently no acceptable replacement cultivars. Hopes have been placed on a variant cultivar called Formosana (GCTCV-218), a type of Taiwanese Cavendish, which has some resistance to TR4. To make things worse, this variant of the pathogen also affects plantains, Musa acuminata √ó balbisiana, which are an important staple food in tropical regions of the world. The average American eats 26.2 pounds of the Cavendish banana each year, and the question is being asked as to whether this oft-consumed fruit is on course to extinction. Apart from the export trade, 85% of banana production is for local consumption and many of the cultivars used for this purpose are also susceptible to infection. Description Fusarium oxysporum is a common inhabitant of soil and produces three types of asexual spores; macroconidia, microconidia and chlamydospores. The macroconidia are nearly straight, slender and thin-walled. They usually have three or four septa, a foot-shaped basal cell and a curved and tapered apical cell. They are generally produced from phialides on conidiophores by basipetal division. They are important in secondary infection.Couteaudier, Y. and C. Alabouvette, 1990 Survival and inoculum potential of conidia and chlamydospores of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lini in soil. Can. J. Microbiol. 36:551-556 The microconidia are ellipsoidal and have either a single septum or none at all. They are formed from phialides in false heads by basipetal division. They are important in secondary infection. The chlamydospores are globose with thick walls. They are either formed from hyphae or by the modification of hyphal cells. They endure in soils for long periods and act as inocula in primary infection. The macroconidia and chlamydospores are normally only formed on dead or dying host plants. Chlamydospores are the most significant survival structures of this pathogen. The teleomorph or sexual reproductive stage of F. oxysporum is unknown.Leslie JF, Summerell BA (2006) The Fusarium Laboratory manual. (Blackwell Publishing: Iowa, USA) Four races of this pathogen have been described which attack different banana cultivars: * Race 1 attacks cultivars in the Musa (AAA group) 'Gros Michel' and caused the 20th century epidemic. It also attacks Musa (AAB group) 'Pome' and its subgroups, Musa (AAB group) 'Silk' and Musa (ABB group) 'Pisang Awak'. * Race 2 attacks Musa (ABB group) 'Bluggoe' and its close relatives. * Race 3 attacks Heliconia spp. * Race 4 attacks Musa (AAA group) 'Dwarf Cavendish' as well as the hosts of races 1 and 2.Crop Protection Compendium 2005 Edition. Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Panama disease of banana). (CAB International: Wallingford, UK).Ploetz RC & Pegg KG (2000). Fusarium wilt. In Jones DR (ed.) Diseases of banana, abaca and enset. (CABI Publishing: Wallingford, UK). p.143-159. Symptoms Infection by F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense triggers the self-defense mechanisms of the host plant causing the secretion of a gel. This is followed by the formation of tylose in the vascular vessels which blocks the movement of water and nutrients to the upper parts of the plant. The tips of the feeder roots are the initial sites of infection which then moves on to the rhizome. The signs of the disease are most noticeable as a dark stain where the stele joins the cortex. As the disease develops, large portions of the xylem turn a reddish-brown colour. Externally, the oldest leaves start turning yellow and there is often a longitudinal splitting of the lower part of the outer leaf sheaths on the pseudostem. The leaves begin to wilt and may buckle at the base of the petiole. As the disease progresses, younger leaves are affected, turn yellow and crumple and the whole canopy begins to consist of dead or dying leaves. The leaf symptoms of Fusarium wilt can be confused with those of Xanthomonas wilt. In plants affected by Fusarium, yellowing and wilting of the leaves typically progresses from the older to the younger leaves. The wilted leaves may also snap at the petiole and hang down the pseudostem. In plants affected by Xanthomonas, the wilting can begin with any leaf and the infected leaves tend to snap along the leaf blade. Management As fungicides are largely ineffective, there are few options for managing Panama disease. Chemical sterilisation of the soil with methyl bromide significantly reduced incidence of the disease but was found to be effective for only three years after which the pathogen had recolonised the fumigated areas.Herbert, J. A., and Marx, D. 1990. Short-term control of Panama disease in South Africa. Phytophylactica 22:339-340. Injecting the host plants with carbendazim and potassium phosphonate appears to provide some control but results have been inconclusive. Heat treatment of soil has also been tried in the Philippines but the pathogen is likely to reinvade the treated area. The greatest hope for managing this disease in infested soils is the development of genetic modifications that will provide resistant cultivars.Ortiz, R., Ferris, R. S. B., and Vuylsteke, D. R. 1995. Banana and plantain breeding. Pages 110-146 in: Bananas and Plantains. Gowen, S., ed. Chapman & Hall. London. Modified bananas developed in collaboration by Ugandan and Belgian scientists were reported in 2008 to be being grown experimentally in Uganda. Research Much research is being undertaken because of the urgency in formulating effective control methods for Panama disease and breeding resistant banana cultivars. Researchers at University Sains Malaysia are examining variability in the genome of the pathogen and its genetic variability is being studied, as are the evolutionary relationships within vegetative compatibility groups of the pathogen. The resistance of different banana cultivars to the pathogen is under scrutiny. Research into the phylogenetic relationships among the different strains of F. oxysporum that cause wilt of banana has been undertaken to determine whether the strains that are specific to the banana have descended from a common ancestor or have developed independently. Results of this study show that it is not monophyletic and appears to have multiple evolutionary origins. The largest lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense (race 1 and 2) are genetically distinct from a lineage originating from East Africa (race 5) and developed pathogenicity for bananas independently from one another.

She was the first Chinese woman to be granted a civil aviation license in China, in 1936, and also co-founded its first civilian flying school. As an actress, she starred in Romance of the Western Chamber, and played the lead in an early adaptation of Mulan for the screen.  Aviator  At the age of sixteen, Li witnessed an airshow in Paris, which left a strong impression on her. In 1943, looking back on the start of her flying career, she explained that she had been troubled by Japanese aggression towards China and decided that she could best serve her country through flying. Li began training at the Contran √âcole d'Aviation in Switzerland, where she was the first female student to receive a pilot's license. In 1935, she enrolled in the Boeing School of Aviation in Oakland, California for advanced training. Later that year, she returned to China, where she was commissioned by the Chinese government to make a 30,000 mile survey of potential air routes. Li also helped found the Shanghai Municipal Air School and worked there as a flight instructor until civilian flights were grounded.

One of his early formative experiences was watching the crowds at the funeral for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi while he still wore the uniform of the newly defunct British Raj just after the formal Partition of India. His subsequent eclectic activities in India included running a mobile cinema. Later he worked for the British High Commission and during his tenure there he helped newcomers to India interpret the local mores and lingo. In 1992 he formally compiled his know-how into the book \\"\\"Hanklyn- Janklin\\"\\" which became well known to locals and foreigners to the Subcontinent alike.

During its history, Vladislav won the Bulgarian Football Championship three times. Vladislav's first title came at the inaugural championship in 1925 and its last was in 1934. Its official descendant by documents and history is Cherno More Varna. Honours Bulgarian State Football Championship: * Winners (3): 1925, 1926, 1934 * Runners-up (4): 1928, 1930, 1937‚Äì38, 1938‚Äì39 History Membership card from 1920. SC Vladislav, officially registered at that time as SC Ticha-Granit branch. Formed on 3 April 1916 as Sport Club Napred. After yearly name changes to SC Razvitie and SC Granit, the club could still not register with the Ministry of Interior until 1919 because of bureaucratic obstacles. For this reason, the board decided to enlist as a collective member of SC Ticha, which was allowed at that time. The club was officially known as SC Ticha - branch SC Granit. On the Annual general meeting of SC Ticha in the spring of 1921 a dispute and disagreement over finances broke out which resulted in the split of the club. SC Granit branch and a number of disgruntled SC Ticha members formed SC Vladislav on 1 May 1921 in honour of W≈Çadys≈Çaw III, King of Poland and Hungary, who was killed in the Battle of Varna in 1444. The club was officially registered under its new name on 14 December 1921. The first green- white striped jerseys were sent from Vienna by club members studying in the Austrian capital. On 10 April 1922 the club played its first intercity match away to Levski Sofia and lost 0-5. The return match in Varna ended in a 1-1 draw. Later in the year, the newly appointed German coach Ernst Murg kick- started what turned out to be one of the success stories in pre-WWII Bulgarian football. In 1923 Vladislav played matches against other Varna teams and Military ship crews. On 29 July the club inflicted a 4-1 defeat on visitors FC 13 Sofia and four weeks later went to Romania for a friendly which turned out to be the first international away game on record in Bulgarian football. A 2-0 win against Victoria in Constanta on 23 August followed by a 4-0 win in the return match on 9 October in Varna. In 1924, Vladislav won the first championship of the newly formed Varna Regional League (VRL). Moreover, the club won twice in a 2 leg friendly against Venus Bucharest (3-0 and 3-1) on 12 and 30 July and lost against SC Romkomit (0-1) on 3 August in Bucharest. On 13 and 14 September Vladislav won the first and only edition of the North Bulgarian Sports League (NBSL) after two straight wins against SK Preslav (3-0) and SC Oto Gabrovo (5-1). The tournament was held in Gabrovo. As the champion of the NBSL, Vladislav was drawn to play Sofia regional champions SC Levski in a semi-final of the first Bulgarian national competition, organised by the recently formed Bulgarian National Sports Federation (BNSF). This semi- final was played in Sofia on 12 October and ended in a 0-0 draw. Due to lack of clear regulations on how to proceed in a match without a winner, the two teams did not re-play and the competition was discontinued. In 1925 the VRL consisted of 5 teams: Vladislav, Shipchenski sokol, Ticha, Diana and Jupiter. Vladislav won 7 matches and drew once to be crowned VRL champions for a second time in 2 years. In the warm-up for the National competition, the team defeated a strong AS 23 Sofia side, 2-1 on 23 July. Defeats against Han Omurtag (4-1), Asenovec (3-0) and Levski Dupnica (4-1) earned the club a place on the final match of the competition. The final was played on 30 August in the Yunak Stadium in Sofia and the opposing side was once again Levski Sofia. The Vladislav line-up was: Yanakiev- Mitev, Georgiev- Hristov, Stavrev, Bulgakov, Terzetta ‚Äì Ivanov, Petrov, Aleksiev, Dimitriev. The game ended in a 2-0 win with goals from Ivanov and captain Terzetta, who was the first player ever to lift the silver cup trophy of H.M. Tzar Boris III. In 1926 after winning its third consecutive VRL title, Vladislav was invited for a friendly by the Romanian runners-up, Juventus Bucharest. The BNSF tried to prevent this from happening as Juventus had crushed Slavia Sofia 4-0 a few weeks earlier and the Bulgarian National team had suffered a humiliating 1-6 defeat on 25 April in Bucharest. The team from Varna took no notice. On 13 June Vladislav defeated Venus 4-2 after trailing 0-2 at half-time and on the next day won against Juventus (2-1). At home, Vladislav reached the final of the National competition defeating Han Krum Shumen (3-0), Chegan Burgas (9-0) and Levski Russe (5-1). The other finalist in the Yunak Stadium on 22 August was Slavia Sofia. The Vladislav line-up was unchanged from the previous year‚Äôs final. The referee was Georgi Grigorov, who was known as one of Slavia‚Äôs founders. The match ended in a 1-1 draw with Dimitar Dimitriev scoring an equaliser. There were no goals scored in the extra time. The re-play was scheduled for the next day but Grigorov did not show up and there was no consensus reached over who would referee the match. BNSF awarded the cup to Slavia and excluded Vladislav from its ranks but the team from Varna appealed in the High Court and 3 months later the BNSF was forced to reverse its decision. A new match was scheduled for 26 December but this time the team of Slavia did not show up. The same happened on the third attempt for a re-match on 7 April 1927 and the BNSF awarded the cup to Vladislav. Slavia refused to hand over the trophy so it had to be taken away from them and brought personally to Varna by a BNSF executive. In 1927 Vladislav became 4th time VRL champions and started preparations for the National competition. A third successive title would make them permanent holders of the silver cup. However, the BNSF suspended all matches until the new regulations were issued, the most important of which was that there would be no permanent holder of the cup and the silver trophy of the Tzar would have to change hands with every new winner of the tournament. It was also announced that the 1927 competition would not take place. In 1928 the fifth successive VRL title was won. Ernst Murg had left his managerial position and bank executive Aleksander Bl√ºmel was running the club. Terzetta ended his career due to injury. Bulgakov, Mitev and Hristov were frequently injured or ill with their places being taken by younger generation players (Kiril Denev, Gencho Dimitrov, Stefan Danchev, Venko Dimitriev). Nevertheless, Vladislav crushed Levski Ruse (5-1) on the semi-final and AS 23 (5-1) in a test just before the final of the National competition. The final was played on 30 September and Vladislav suffered a thrashing defeat, 0-4 to Slavia. Vladislav won its 6th VRL title in 1930. After defeating Slava Yambol (7-0) and Han Omurtag Shumen (4-2) in the National competition, the team reached the final for a record 4th time. The game was played on 3 October against old foes Slavia. Vladislav lost 1-4 in a match remembered for the blunders from keeper Zdravko Yanakiev. He left Vladislav shortly after to play for local rivals Shipchenski sokol. In the following three years Vladislav was in crisis which forced the new chairman Luca Dorosiev to make a number of changes. He signed the attacking players Asen Myankov from Maritza Plovdiv, Stefan Boranov, Georgi Radev and keeper Zhecho Petkov from Provadiya. The defence was reinforced by club youngsters Ivan Mokanov, Panayot Georgiev and Nikola Kaldaramov. In 1934 Vladislav won the VRL competition in a group with Sh.Sokol, Ticha, Varna, Pobeda and Bulgaria without losing a single match. In the run-up to the final of the National competition the team knocked out Han Omurtag (4-1), Botev Yambol (6-0) and Napredak Ruse (3-1). The line-up for the final was Zhecho Petkov- Ivan Mokanov, Panayot Georgiev- Nikola Kaldaramov, Tzvetan Dimitrov, Andrej Ivanov, Stefan Boranov- Asen Myankov, Kiril Denev, Evtim Filev and Venko Dimitriev. The score was opened from a close distance by Evtim Filev after the Slavia defence failed to clear the ball. Captain Kiril Denev headed a cross from Stefan Boranov for the final 2-0 victory and third National championship title for Vladislav. In the next two years Vladislav surrendered its leading position in the VRL to SC Ticha. In 1936 the club was excluded from the league because of an irregular player. The management used the interruption for further rejuvenation of the team with a total of 11 youngsters aged 18‚Äì20. Georgi Hristov, Stoyan Ormandzhiev, Mladen Djurov and Jordan Kirchev made their names known in the regional and national competitions. On 10 July 1936 French runners-up Racing Strasbourg came to Varna after having defeated Slavia in Sofia 2-0. The French had a 2-1 lead until the last minute of the game when Georgi Hristov, known for his speed and the fact that he was playing with glasses, equalized with an individual action from the left wing. In the VRL competition in 1937, Vladislav won all its matches against Sh.Sokol, Ticha, Pobeda, Radetzki and Asparuh and drew once against Levski to become 8th time regional champion. On 25 May, the team visited Istanbul on invitation of local club SC Pera and lost 1-3. At home, Vladislav had a tough semi-final match against Levski Ruse for the National competition which ended in a 1-1 draw after extra time. Because of injuries and suspended players Vladislav did not travel for the re-play and lost by forfeit. In October 1937, the BNSF made a fundamental change in the way the National competition was conducted. The regional leagues were scrapped, replaced by a new National league consisting of 10 teams to play each other on home and away fixtures, causing bitter disputes between regional representatives about who was going to play in the league. Vladislav‚Äôs chairman Stefan Konstantinov made it clear that if VRL was not represented by two clubs in the league, his team would withdraw. Eventually, BNSF accepted both SC Ticha and SC Vladislav in this inaugural National league of 1938 in which SC Ticha ended up as champions and SC Vladislav as runners-up. The Vladislav team was represented by: goalkeepers Kiril Momchilov and Zdravko Yanakiev, full-backs Ivan Mokanov and StoyanOrmandzhiev, half-backs Nikola Kaldaramov, Georgi Mishkov, Tzvetan Dimitrov and Aleksandar Koev, forwards Stefan Boranov, Archangel Stojnov, Georgi Hristov, Jordan Kirchev, Lambo Atanasov, Vassil Radev and Anton Grozdanov. In the following 1938-39 season of the National league, Vladislav was once again a runner-up, trailing one point behind champions Slavia. The title was decided in the last game of the season in a match between the two contenders on 23 July in Sofia. Slavia needed a win while a draw was good enough for Vladislav to win the title. Krum Milev from Slavia scored the winning goal in the 12 th minute of the game with a long distance deflected shot. Georgi Hristov had the chance to clinch the title for Vladislav with a last-minute attempt but after being left unmarked at the face of goal his shot went wide. 1939-40. After a mediocre performance in the autumn, Vladislav did not win a single match. The team did better in the spring but finished bottom of the table with only 11 points. Nevertheless, Vladislav secured its stay in the National division after winning the play-off against Botev Plovdiv (1-1,2-0). 1940-41. After the first round only, the National division disintegrated because of disagreements between the clubs about its content. The old system with regional leagues and a knock-out competition between their winners was reinstated. Vladislav won its record 9th VRL title adding new power in the attack with youngsters Nedko Nedev and Mladen Djurov. 1941-44. With the onset of the occupation of Bulgaria and the military mobilisation of many young men, Vladislav could hardly assemble a team. This was the case in the National competition when Vladislav lost by forfeit to FC 13 Sofia. After the 9 September 1944 coup, the new government of the Fatherland Front liked to toy with the idea of wiping up everything it deemed bourgeois establishment. All leading clubs without exception underwent mergers. Following the restructuring of social and sports life under the new communist ruled government, SC Vladislav merged with SC Ticha on 18 February 1945 with all its available assets (players, coaches, finances). 13 Vladislav players were included in the merged team. These were: playing coach Ivan Mokanov, keeper Zhecho Petkov, full-backs Dimitar Dimitrov and Mancho Rachev, half-backs Nikola Kaldaramov and Georgi Georgiev, forwards Lazar Logofetov, Bogomil Kostov, Nedko Nedev, Mladen Dzhurov, Nikola Zhelev, Hristo Konakov and Atanas Konakov. Under the name Ticha-Vladislav the club took part in the first post-WWII competition. The name changed on a number of occasions to eventually become Cherno More in 1959.

Passengers were evacuated, but three were killed and 43 injured. A subsequent investigation concluded that the fire had started in an electric panel for which maintenance was never prescribed.Technical failure likely cause of Surgut plane explosion ‚Äì investigation, RIAN, 3 January 2011Death toll in plane explosion in Siberia reaches three (Update 5), RIAN, 1 January 2011 Accident On the morning of 1 January 2011, Flight 348 was preparing to depart at Surgut International Airport for a flight to Moscow. At 10:00 local time (05:00 UTC), as the aircraft was being pushed back and was starting its engines, a fire developed in the centre section of the fuselage, quickly spreading inside the passenger cabin. The engines and the APU were immediately shut down and the emergency slides were deployed for an emergency evacuation. Within four minutes, fire engines reached the Tupolev and started dousing the flames with foam, but were hampered by the presence of survivors near the aircraft. By 10:20, the aircraft was completely ablaze, with aviation fuel leaking and spreading the flames across the apron. The fire was brought under control at around 10:40; by then, only the tail section and the outer portion of the wings had survived the blaze. Three passengers were killed and 43 were injured, four critically, from smoke inhalation or burns. Aircraft RA-85588, the Tu-154 involved, seen at Domodedovo Airport three months before the accident The aircraft involved was a tri-jet Tupolev Tu-154B-2, registration RA-85588, msn 83A/588. The aircraft first flew in 1983. It entered service with Aeroflot as CCCP-85588 and was re-registered RA-85588 in 1993. It then served with Mavial Magadan Airlines between 1994 and 1999, when it began service with Vladivostok Air. Kogalymavia (trading as Kolavia) acquired the aircraft in 2007. Passengers and crew The aircraft was carrying 116 passengers, 8 crew, and 10 off-duty employees of Kogalymavia, although a statement by the Russia's Ministry of Health and Social Development gave figures of 117 passengers and 18 crew. Among the passengers were members of the 1990s Russian boy band Na Na, who managed to evacuate safely from the plane. Aftermath Following the accident, Russia's Federal Transport Oversight Agency advised airlines that they should stop using the Tu-154B until the accident had been investigated. This would affect 14 aircraft, all other Tu-154s in service are Tu-154Ms. Kogalymavia pledged to pay compensation of —Ä—É–± 20,000 to those passengers involved in the accident. The Russian insurance company Sogaz stated that those injured in the accident would receive between —Ä—É–± 20,000 and —Ä—É–± 2,000,000 compensation. The families of those killed would receive —Ä—É–± 2,000,000 compensation. Authorities in the Khanty‚ÄìMansi Autonomous Okrug ‚Äì Yugra had allocated —Ä—É–± 10,000,000 to assist the families of those injured in the accident. Investigation MAK's final investigation report Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) opened an investigation into the accident. A separate criminal investigation was opened to investigate allegations of breaching transport and fire safety rules. Both flight recorders were recovered and analysed. Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations stated that the initial investigations pointed towards an electrical short circuit being the cause of the fire, which started in the central area of the fuselage, ahead of the rear-mounted engines. In September 2011, the MAK released its final report in Russian, confirming that the probable cause of the fire was an arc occurred in an electric panel on the right side of the fuselage hosting the generator contactors. Shortly after engine start, the crew connected the generators to the electrical network as usual, but the badly worn out contactors failed to operate properly, resulting in an abnormal circuit configuration that produced currents 10 to 20 times higher than their nominal values, giving rise to an electrical arc. The MAK determined that no maintenance schedule existed for the electric board in question.

Background Since the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), southwestern China (Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi) was within the control of the Ming Empire, but the state control of these territories was weak. The Yongzheng Emperor of the Qing dynasty decided to strengthen it, replacing local, semi-independent chieftains, called tusi, with regular Qing administration. To achieve this goal, the prince Ortai led several military campaigns into the area, pacifying them between 1726 and 1732. However, military control did not stop the official abuse and extortion, suppressing only the reaction against them. Rebellion By 1735, misrule and extortion proved too much and the local people rose to fight. Some of them were desperate enough as to kill their wives and children before joining the rebellion, thus burning all bridges behind them. The uprising started in Taigong, then covering the area of Liping and Duyun. Local Qing administration, unable to cope with the rebels, suggested making a kind of agreement with them, but the Qianlong Emperor recalled the previous commanders and appointed Zhang Guangsi, an experienced officer under Ortai, to quell the rebellion. The uprising was bloodily suppressed, the last rebels doggedly fighting at Niupidajing. Altogether Qing armies destroyed approximately 1200 Miao forts and killed over 18,000 warriors. The campaign lasted from February to November 1736. Zhang, meanwhile appointed Governor-General of Guizhou, started to build roads, strengthening the garrisons and opening the mines, to enhance both imperial control and the economy of the region. The suppression of the revolt granted the area half a century of peace, but the deep causes of unrest remained unchanged and the tensions grew again, until the Miao rebelled again in 1795.

Prime BEEFs provide a full range of engineering support required to establish, operate, and maintain garrison and contingency airbases. Overview The primary mission of Prime BEEF is to provide civil engineer support for the beddown of personnel and aircraft. Prime BEEF capabilities include airbase site surveys, establishing bare base camps and operations and utility system installation. Since Prime BEEF forces specialize in airfield operations, they are the primary units considered when establishing and sustaining airfield operations at locations where U.S. Air Force aircraft operate. Prime BEEF forces have the necessary command, control and communications to support beddown; fire emergency services; emergency management; explosive ordnance disposal; expedient construction; explosive incident response; chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear response and other specialized teams that provide unique engineering capabilities. Prime BEEF teams are also called on to support recovery operations after a natural or man-made disaster to assess damage, fight fires, mitigate hazards, provide emergency utilities, beddown military forces and disaster victims, repair facility damage, and control and monitor contamination. Although Prime BEEF units are rapidly deployable and capable of providing support anywhere in the world on short notice, they are typically assigned to an installation. Therefore, when operations require heavy construction support, the U.S. Air Force employs the capabilities of RED HORSE (Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers) units.AFCESA Factsheet: United States Air Force Prime BEEF Units, 6/4/2010 After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Prime BEEF teams were the first U.S. Air Force Civil Engineers deployed across the Southwest Asia area of responsibility to support Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and then, Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. History The Lebanon Crisis of 1958, the Berlin Crisis of 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 demonstrated a need for the capability to respond to worldwide emergencies. Aircraft and support personnel were being deployed without providing runways, water supply, electricity, housing, and other facilities necessary to support them. Civil engineering personnel, who could rapidly respond, were needed to accompany aircraft and to provide basing facilities. The U.S. Air Force's answer was the Prime BEEF program. The Air Force established the Prime BEEF program in 1964, posturing civil engineers to better respond to worldwide contingencies. Military civil engineers were divided into specially trained and equipped mobility and recovery teams, each with their own unit type code identifier. The first Prime BEEF deployment went to San Isidro Air Base, Dominican Republic to support the airlift moving U.S. Army forces into the area in May 1965. That same year the Air Force deployed dozens of separate teams as the buildup of forces in Southeast Asia began, base civil engineering forces were inundated with construction, operations, and maintenance requirements. Large numbers of U.S. Air Force strike aircraft were sent to bases where pavement for aircraft parking was at a premium. Aircraft were parked wing tip to wing tip, vulnerable to an accidental explosion or enemy attack. A need for aircraft revetments was dramatically brought home on 15 May 1965 when the explosion of a bomb under the wing of a loaded B-57 aircraft set off a chain reaction of explosions on the parking apron at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. Forty aircraft were destroyed, 26 Americans killed, and over 60 wounded. Three 25-man Prime BEEF teams were organized from Air Training Command, Strategic Air Command, and Air Defense Command. Teams were deployed to Tan Son Nhut, Bien Hoa and Da Nang Air Bases (all in South Vietnam) to construct aircraft revetments and complete whatever work that was needed. During their 120-day deployments, the teams constructed over of revetments, parking aprons, and several miles of roads. The revetments paid for themselves in saved aircraft in just the first six months. Soon other specialized teams were deployed to bases in Vietnam and Thailand to perform short-term construction projects. A Prime BEEF team was sent to Tan Son Nhut to ensure the rapidly growing base had an adequate water supply. Prime BEEF III sent teams to several other bases to build housing. The teams erected \\"hootches,\\" framed tents, and constructed over of support facilities at six bases in South Vietnam. Prime BEEF teams continued to perform critical repair and construction work in Southeast Asia. Between 1965 and 1972, nearly 2,000 Prime BEEF team members were deployed to Southeast Asia to construct vital petroleum, oil, and lubricant (POL) pipelines and storage facilities; install jet engine exhaust blast deflectors; provide electrical power to buildings; and to erect small buildings. The Prime BEEF program proved its value in additional situations. Several hundred personnel were deployed to Korea during Operation Combat Fox, following the seizure of the USS Pueblo in 1968. These teams dug wells, laid airfield matting, erected frame buildings, installed aircraft arresting systems, sandbagged bunkers, and rehabilitated building and utility systems to facilitate the buildup of American forces at Korean air bases. As the Vietnam War began to wind down, Prime BEEF teams remained in great demand by the U.S. Air Force. A number of these teams completed civic action projects in the Trust Territories of the Pacific Islands (which became the Federated States of Micronesia). In 1969, firefighters, now a part of the Prime BEEF program, were sent to locations around the world to provide fire protection and crash/rescue support. Teams also provided civil engineering support for various research projects. For example, they supported a project of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory testing on Eniwetok Atoll in 1972.Prime BEEF See also * Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency * Combat engineer * Military engineering of the United States * Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers * Sapper * Seabees * United States Army Corps of Engineers References External links *Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency United States Air Force Engineering units and formations of the United States military Military units and formations established in 1964 ","title":"Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force"},{"id":"30269134","text":"Benfica F.C. is a football team based in Drax Hall, Jamaica.

In 1771 the Quaker physician John Fothergill, along with two other members of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks and Marmaduke Tunstall, sponsored Smeathman to spend four years in and around the Sierra Leone peninsula studying its natural history,Braidwood S. (1994) p. 6 specifically its insects.  Life  = Sierra Leone = Smeathman made his voyage to Africa aboard a trade ship called the Fly, which was transporting barrels of rum to the West African coast. The Fly arrived at Sierra Leone on December 12, 1771. Smeathman was given some key contacts in West African coast including African-European slave trading families, presumably from Drury, Fothergill or Banks. With these contacts, Smeathman was first granted permission to stay in the Banana Islands, where he settled on December 17, 1771 and stayed for more than three years. Upon arrival, Smeathman presented himself to King James Cleveland, an African-European slave trader who helped him settle and explore by taking him in through negotiating terms with other members of the local ruling elite (referred to as \\"kings\\" or \\"chiefs\\" by the traders in the region). In exchange for gifts, Smeathman was given permission to settle on the islands, and he was also given help in his research. He relied on the locals to assist him in constructing a house and he bartered with them in order to obtain local resources. This dependence came about due to the lack of European settlement in his location of residence. Shortly after his arrival, Smeathman contracted a case of what he described as malaria. Though he claimed that he had cured himself with Dr. Fothergill's advice and his medical books that he had brought along, he suffered from symptoms of the disease until his death from a fever, which was fifteen years after initial exposure. Although his voyage was sponsored in large part by anti-slavery Quakers like John Fothergill, Smeathman relied on individuals involved in slave-trading networks, such as British slave-trader Miles Barber, for support and assistance. He and Andreas Berlin, his botanist assistant, also frequently socialized and played golf with slave-trading merchants and agents. In fact, Smeathman seems to have regarded slave traders as 'gentlemen' and tried to refashion himself as one of them. Smeathman travelled and gathered specimens throughout the Sherbro area, the Kamaranka River, and the Sierra Leone River estuary. In addition, he visited Bunce Island to ship out his specimens. Smeathman relied on assistance from indigenous people in his collections and research, particularly with the examination of termite mounds, but was often reluctant to accept their entomological knowledge. He initially encountered problems with preserving his specimens during oceanic transport, but discovered that placing boxes of specimens atop opened rum barrels effectively prevented their destruction. = Marriages = Smeathman married his first wife on July 21, 1772, to an African woman who was the daughter of \\"the King of a Country up the River Sherbro,\\" and at one point may have had three wives simultaneously. Marriage with local women, especially daughters of influential persons, was one of the most significant chances for strangers to settle down. He openly wrote about his wives very frankly and appeared to treat and view African wives as a necessary commodity in comparison to his books. Though he took on multiple spouses and wrote about spending very little amounts of money on his wives, he also denounced the slave traders for having too many wives and for treating their wives poorly. According to John C. Lettsome, Smeathman married first the daughter of King Tom and later the daughter of King James Cleveland; however on both these occasions his spouse died.Braidwood S. (1994) p. 7 = Departure from Africa = Smeathman departed Sierra Leone in 1775 via a slave ship. However, he was delayed in the Caribbean by illness and the American War of Independence while en route to England. Hence, Smeathman supplemented this work with a further four years spent in the Caribbean. Smeathman also participated in slave trading, buying and bringing on route with him a number of enslaved people to sell. During his return to England, Smeathman drew up a proposal to the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor and British government Treasury in 1786 to establish a colonial settlement in Sierra Leone. His plan directly led to the government funding, coercing and forcing Black people in England to travel to Sierra Leone. Andreas Berlin, one of the apostles of Linnaeus, was among Smeathman's associates.  Texts  * Smeathman, H. (1781) Some Account of the Termites, which are Found in Hot Climates. Phil. Trans. Roy.

The church is thought to have first been built in the 11th or 12th century and then later extended in the 14th century. The church is also registered as a Small Place of Pilgrimage.  Housing  In the parish of Great Henny, information has showed that there has always been a small amount of housing in the area, with the highest number of houses between 1831 and 1961, according to census information, being 88 in 1851. This number had slowly increased from 1831 however after 1851, the number of houses within the area began to slowly decrease and the census information in 1961 showed that in total there were 58 total houses in the area. This number had increased again, to 72 by the latest census which was taken in 2011. Population of Great Henny, Essex, Civil Parish as reported by the census of population from 1801-1961.  Population  According to the 2011 census, the population of Great Henny in that year was 191 people. Census data tells us that the population of Great Henny has not fluctuated majorly over the past 200 years since 1811, when census data is available for Great Henny. Over each ten-year period when the census was taken between 1811 and 1951, the population decreased every year except from the year 1951 when the population increased by 3. During every other census, however, the population was seen to decrease, with the largest decline being in 1901, when the population had decreased by 78 from the previous census. The total number of houses within the area can be seen to have decreased within the period of 1831-1961, when this data is available. In 1861, the total number of houses was 83, and while this remained steady and actually increased to 88 in 1881, the total number of households was seen to decrease every ten years when the census was taken and in 1961 there were only 58 houses in the area. This number, however, is an increase upon the lowest number of 43 houses which was in 1931. The decrease in the number of houses could be linked to the decreasing population during these times.  Employment  Historical map of Great Henny In 1831, the majority of males over the age of 20 (73% of employed males) were agricultural labourers. The next leading occupation, although only at approximately 6%, was males employed in retail and handicrafts. Still in 1881, the majority of workers worked in agriculture, followed by general or unspecified commodities. At this time however, there are also records of females being employed although records show that the majority of females worked in an \\"unknown occupation.\\" Many females also worked in dress or domestic services or offices. According to the 2011 census, however, only 5 people were working in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries. The three most popular employment categories were: professional, scientific and technical activities employing a total of 20 people, construction employing a total of 14 people followed by manufacturing providing employment for 11 people. This shows how the area and industry within the area has developed over the past 200 years. Graph showing occupational data of the population of Great Henny, Essex, in 1881.

A branch was formed in Victoria in the same year. In July 1885, both the Queensland and the South Australian branches started. In July 1886 the society became the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia. The New South Wales branch's new constitution in 1886 widened its scope to encourage interest in scientific, commercial, educational and historical aspects of geography. The Society sponsored several important expeditions, notably the New Guinea Exploration Expedition in 1885, and whose members included zoologist Wilhelm Haacke, erstwhile director of the South Australian Museum. The Victorian branch amalgamated with the Victorian Historical Society, while the New South Wales branch had ceased to function by the early 1920s. The South Australian and Queensland branches continue as the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia and Royal Geographical Society of Queensland respectively (see External links below). South Australia The South Australian branch was formed on 10 July 1885. In 1905 they acquired the York Gate Library, following the death of Stephen William Silver a prosperous London merchant who had branched out into publishing information for colonial settlers alongside clothes, furniture and other equipment for use in the British colonies. =Members= The founding members were: * His Honor the Chief Justice S.

The government of the Song dynasty actively promoted the study of mathematics. There were two government xylograph editions of The Ten Computational Canons in the years 1084 and 1213. The wide availability of these mathematical texts contributed to the flourishing of mathematics in the Song and Yuan dynasties, inspiring mathematicians such as Jia Xian, Qin Jiushao, Yang Hui, Li Zhi and Zhu Shijie. In the Ming dynasty during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, some of the Ten Canons were copied into the Yongle Encyclopedia.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for one term between 1856 and 1857. Early life Hely was the son of Frederick Augustus Hely, an Irish public servant who was appointed as the Superintendent of Convicts in 1823. He was educated at The King's School, Parramatta and was initially employed as a clerk in the Colonial Secretary's office. He took part in the 1846-47 expedition of Ludwig Leichhardt but was accused by Leichhardt of indolence, disloyalty and \\"disgusting\\" behaviour. Nonetheless he was put in charge of the official expedition to find Leichhardt in 1852. After 1841 Hely managed his deceased father's estates in the Brisbane Water district including Wyoming Cottage. He inherited a fifth share of the estate when he turned 21 and borrowed heavily against it, to finance a trip to England in 1858. As a result of these debts, Hely was bankrupted in 1865. Colonial Parliament In 1856 Hely was elected as one of the three members for Northumberland and Hunter in the first New South Wales Legislative Assembly under responsible government. His parliamentary performance was uninspiring and he did not hold office. He did not contest the next election in 1858.

It was built in 1779 and was originally known as San Miguel Church. The Santa Monica Church complex includes the convent connected to the church by an elevated three-level brick stairway. The parish church of Santa Monica is renowned as the largest church in the whole Ilocos Norte province, most especially the length of the nave. In June 1983, the church was the setting for the grand wedding of Gregorio Araneta and Irene Marcos, the daughter of then President Marcos. It was declared as an Important Cultural Property by the National Museum of the Philippines on September 27, 2009. History Sarrat used to be a visita of Laoag. It was originally named as San Miguel to mark the arrival of the first Augustinian missionaries in Sarrat during the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel on September 29, 1724. The parish of Santa Monica de Sarrat was erected in 1724. It was only in 1769 when the convent was built to serve as a temporary chapel. The church, belfry, convent, and the curillo or bridge staircase connecting the church and convent was simultaneously constructed and finished in 1779. On March 3, 1816, the church was destroyed with just a few jewels saved by the Father Juan Casas. Father Vicente Barreiro, who was the prior in 1818, worked for five years and finished the reconstruction of the convent in 1817. Father Isidro Champaner rebuilt the church in 1848. The church buildings burned again on 1882 and were repaired by Father Leandro Collado during his long assignment from 1875 to 1895. During the 1950s, Father Clemente Tabije supervised the reinforcement of the roof by putting massive posts inside. Former first Lady Imelda Marcos spearheaded restoration work for the church in June 1977. A few months after the wedding of Irene Marcos and Gregorio Araneta, a devastating earthquake hit the province of Ilocos Norte which recorded a magnitude of 5.3 (MI) on the Richter scale and an intensity 7 on the Rossi-Forel scale on August 17, 1983 .Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS). \\"Laoag Earthquake - 17 August 1983\\". Compilation of Damaging Earthquake of the Philippines. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. The tremor sustained a major structural damage on the church's facade as well as toppling down the bell tower. The church underwent restoration and repair after the earthquake. Architecture Sarrat Church is the biggest in Ilocos Norte and possibly in the whole Ilocos region. The church is made from red bricks built in Earthquake Baroque and Neoclassical architecture. The church tower has a big clock that strikes every half-hour. Around the church are brick fourteen Stations of the Cross. The convent, also known as Casa del Palacio Real, was rebuilt after two fires in March 1816 and October 1892. It served as the Presidencia Municipal or present-day town hall. It also housed Colegio de Santa Monica, an affiliate of Lyceo de Manila. The ground floor of the convent was converted as the parish museum and photo gallery in 1994. In popular culture The church was the venue of the grand wedding of Irene Marcos, daughter of President Ferdinand Marcos, and Gregorio Araneta in June 1983. A longer and wider choir loft was added for the wedding. The church garden was renovated to serve as the venue for the reception.

It covers the areas Slependen, Jong and Tanum. Sports clubs in the area before World War II were Tanum IL, and minor clubs such as Jongs√•sen IF, Pil and Uredd. IL Jardar was founded as a children's sports club on 4 June 1962. It now has sections for association football, team handball and Nordic skiing (cross- country skiing and ski jumping). The clubroom was opened on 9 November 1983. The women's football team was the club's flagship with many seasons in the Norwegian Women's Premier League. It also reached the semi-finals of the Norwegian Cup in 1986 and 1989. It did not play in the inaugural season of a nationwide league (\\"First Division\\") in 1987, but was promoted from the Second Division through playoff. In the 1990 First Division Jardar ended last, losing all away games, and was relegated. Jan Erik Aalbu was hired as the new coach. After re-promotion in 1991, the team ultimately left the highest tier when ending last in the 1993 First Division, again losing all away games. Ellen Scheel Aalbu, married to coach Aalbu, was a well-known club player with 32 caps. Torill Hoch-Nielsen had 39 caps. Other international players include Birthe Hegstad and Reidun Seth. Scheel represented the club in the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. The women's team played at Nadderud stadion while on a national level. Jardar's home field is now Bj√∏rneg√•rd, with artificial grass from 2009. The women's team last participated in the Fourth Division, the fifth tier of Norwegian football, in 2010 as a cooperation team between northern neighbors IL Jutul and B√¶rums Verk IF. The men's football team currently plays in the Fourth Division, the fifth tier. In later years it has been coached by Eirik Markeg√•rd and Mads Clausen, notable footballers in their own right. Clausen has also played for the club. Members of the skiing section include Nordic combined skier Ansgar Danielsen, and ski jumper Andreas Vilberg. Live Frisak has jumped in the Women's Continental Cup, and in 2004 IL Jardar won a gender equality prize from Akershus County Municipality.

History Hart Common was once one of the most rural and least populated hamlets which made up the township of Westhoughton. The area's name is taken from a prominent local family, the Harts. The Hart family owned a small estate, which adjoined common land. The first recorded mention of Hart Common as a place name was in 1541 during a court hearing involving the family. In the 1860s, the population of Westhoughton had begun to increase considerably, rising from around 4,000 to 9,000 since the turn of the century. In the 1870s, plans for large coal mines across Westhoughton were made - notably the sinking of two shafts by the Wigan Coal and Iron Company; one at Eatock Farm, and one at Hart Common. A further increase in population was imminent, and a decision to build a school and church at Hart Common was made by a local Vicar, Reverend Kinton Jacques. Jaques wrote in his memoirs: \\"As large coal mines were about to be opened by the Wigan and Coal Iron Co. at Hart Common, a district on the west-side of the parish, I foresaw there would be need of a school and room for church services, so I felt it would be well to be prepared, before the workers arrived\\". Rows of cottages were built to house the colliery workers. Higher quality terraces were erected on the north side of the A58, either side of Patterson Street, to house the managers. The pits were sunk in 1871, and due to a shortage of labour, many newcomers arrived and settled in the village. The newcomers were said to have \\"arrived at Crows Nest Siding under a tar sheet\\", and were said to have a strange lingo. The census from 1881 shows that those living in the cottages had resided from the following areas; Hampshire, Westmorland, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Somerset, County Mayo, Cheshire, Prescott, St Helens, Barnsley, Cornwall, Glamorgan, Oldham and Upholland. The villagers did not take kindly to the newcomers, and for many years afterwards the remark \\"Thi fayther cum fr' under't tar sheet\\" was enough to start a fight. The Hewlett Pits In 1871 the Hewlett pits were sunk by the Wigan Coal and Iron Company. The colliery superintendent's house, 552 Wigan Road, overlooked the entrance to the colliery on Hewlett Street and a cast iron footbridge over the railway. Many men in the district found work in there. During the Franco-Prussian War in the mid-1870s, the miners were able to earn ¬£1 per day, however when the war ended the price of coal fell to 6 shillings per ton and Mr Hewlett called for drastic reductions in the miners' wages. These were strenuously opposed by the miners and a strike ensued. It was then that more workers arrived and settled at Hart Common from further afield, which the villagers did not take kindly to. By 1896 the Wigan Coal and Iron Company who owned the Hewlett Pits, employed 981 men underground and 182 surface workers. In 1912 there was a minimum wage dispute at the pits, and soldiers and police were called in to defend the colliery. The last coal was raised at Hewlett on 1 January 1931. All the main buildings were demolished in 1933. The area was landscaped and returned to pasture in the early 1980s. A plaque on 552 Wigan Road (now the Saplings Day Nursery) reads: IN MEMORIAM.. ..THE NAMES HERE RECORDED ARE OF THOSE MEN WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE GREAT WAR AUGUST 1914 TO NOVEMBER 1918 AS WELL AS THE NAMES OF THOSE WHO OBTAINED MILITARY DISTINCTIONS IN THE WAR.. ..1&2 HEWLETT PITS KILLED.. This is followed by the names of those killed, and the men who received military honours. Hart Common Church and School The decision to build a school and church at Hart Common was proposed in the early 1870s by local vicar Reverend Kinton Jacques, due to the sudden increase in population. The vicar stated in his memoir \\"a well-known Lancashire family, with some members of which I had been well acquainted, lived on this spot, and the father had made, by his persevering industry, a fortune. The thought struck me, \\"Why not erect a useful momento?\\" So I got a design drawn by an architect, of the Hargreaves Memorial School, Hart Common, and sent copies to members of the family. The late Mr. William Hargreaves, who lived then at Moss Bank, sent for me, approved of the idea, promised me ¬£500, and said the work should be done. Other members of the family sent me handsome contributions, and the school was taken in hand and finished\\". In March 1878, the following announcement was published in the Bolton Chronicle: \\"A new school is about to be erected at Hart Common. It is to cost ¬£1,000 and to be called the Hargreaves Memorial School. It has also been decided that a curate is to be put in charge of Hart Common. The architect is Mr. R. K. Freeman of Bolton and the contractor is Mr. Chas, Dickinson of Westhoughton\\". The school opened on Monday 10 March 1979, with 34 children being admitted. The following headteachers were appointed to Hart Common School; Mr. F.W. FItznewton (29 May 1882 ‚Äì 6 March 1896), Mr. T. Billington (9 March 1896 ‚Äì 28 February 1933), Mr. F. Gibson (1 March 1933 ‚Äì 30 April 1954), Mr. N.L. Carter (1 May 1954 ‚Äì 8 August 1958), Mr. E. Rudd (11 August 1958 ‚Äì 22 December 1961), Mr. L. Rimmer (8 January 1962 ‚Äì 10 April 1968), Mrs. P.A. Knowles (25 April 1968 - 1996). The school was closed and relocated in 1996 due to growing pupil numbers. The Bolton News reported: \\"New houses were springing up over the town and the small Victorian school was unable to provide the space or the facilities needed. Last year the building was so overcrowded that one of the classes was held in part of the hall\\". St George's CE Primary School was built to replace Hart Common School. The stained glass windows and war memorial panels were transferred to the new school. Hart Common Church Still stands at the site of the old school. The Hart Family The first recorded mention of the Hart family dates from 1451, at which time the Harts were a very prominent farming family in the township of Westhoughton. The name of Hart Common derives from the Hart Family. Other memorials of the family exist, such as the Hart's-i-th'Hole farm on Wearish Lane. The first time Hart Common was officially referred to as a place name was in 1541, when Richard Hart, described as \\"from Hart Common\\" appeared in the Duchy Court of Lancaster in connection with a lawsuit. A later unrelated hearing from 1565 makes reference to William and Richard Hart from Hart Common. The family name is further mentioned in the Dean Parish Register, which reads \\"Burial at Dean, 14th September, 1655, Roger Hart of the Hole at Westhoughton\\". A headstone in Dean Churchyard reads \\"Here lyeth the body of Mr. James Hart of Hart Common in Westhoughton who departed this life ye 26 day of July 1709 in ye 34 year of his age\\". Little else is known about the family after the late 1790s. Amenities The village retains most of the terraced cottages, with the exception of those on Hart Street which were demolished many years ago. The rubble from the demolition was covered with earth and grassed over, with two hills now standing in their place. The cobbled road of Hart Street leads a children's playground and football pitches. Hart Common is now well known for its large 18 hole golf course, which was converted from farmland. The 120 acre Hart Common Farm was noted in 1963 to be the only farm in Westhoughton with sheep. The farm was owned by the Hargreaves family, of whom the Hargreaves Memorial School was named after. All the fields had names; Big Meadow, Long Shutts, Sandall, Beanfield, Clear Pit, School Field, and Cow Hey. The farm dated back to 1701. Hart Common Golf Course was opened on the site in 1995. The village is home to Westhoughton Rangers Football Club, who play on playing fields on common land leased for a peppercorn rent from the Hart Common Mission Church Trust. Coleman Milne, manufacturer of funeral vehicles, stretch limousines and other specialist vehicles is located in the village, at the site of the old Messrs W.H.S. Taylor wholesale grocers cash and carry warehouse. Hart Common once had two public houses (The Hart Common and the Bridge Inn), a post office, a police station, a petrol station, a school, a Co-op shop and grocery, a butchers, two general stores and two other butcher's shops. The Bridge Inn is now an Indian Restaurant. A car showroom stands at the site of the old Co-op. The school, closed in 1995, is now used as a church. The old petrol station is disused. The rest of the amenities have been converted in to houses. The neighbouring hamlet of Marsh Brook reduced in stature, is incorporated into Hart Common. Westhoughton Greyhound Track used to stand at Marsh Brook, but was demolished in 2014. Permission has been granted for a new housing estate to be built on this site.

Opened in 1868, it forms a junction between three main lines, from Bari, Brindisi and Reggio di Calabria, respectively. It is also a terminus of a secondary line, the Bari‚ÄìMartina Franca‚ÄìTaranto railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. The station's main line train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Regional train services on the Bari‚ÄìMartina Franca‚ÄìTaranto railway are operated by Ferrovie del Sud Est (FSE). Location Taranto railway station is situated at Piazza della Libert√†, at the end of Via Duca d'Aosta. It is a short distance to the north west of the Ponte di Porta Napoli, the bridge over the natural channel between Taranto's Mar Grande and its Mar Piccolo. The station is linked with the city centre by a combination of the Ponte di Porta Napoli, the Isola del Borgo Antico, and the Ponte di San Francesco di Paola, or Ponte Girevole (), a well known symbol of Taranto. The latter bridge spans the artificial channel between the Mar Grande and the Mar Piccolo. History The station was opened on 15 September 1868, upon the inauguration of the Gioia del Colle‚ÄìTaranto section of the Bari‚ÄìTaranto railway. On 28 February 1869, Taranto was also connected with Metaponto, as the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (, SFM) had initiated the construction of the Jonica railway (Taranto‚ÄìReggio di Calabria). On the same day, a connection between the station and the Port of Taranto was opened, as was the first section of the Battipaglia‚ÄìPotenza‚ÄìMetaponto railway that, once completed, would open the then-important rail link to Salerno and Naples. In 1886, the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate del Mediterraneo () opened the Taranto‚ÄìBrindisi railway. When finished, it would secure the faster and safer rail connection between these two major railway stations and port locations. From that point onwards, Taranto station was shared by two railway administrations, Rete Adriatica and Rete Mediterranea. Until the late nineteenth century, Taranto was an important railway junction for traffic in foodstuffs and timber from Calabria and Sicily to the Adriatic and the north. Its importance waned after the opening of the Southern Tyrrhenian railway, which diverted most of this traffic via Salerno and Naples. The establishment of the Ferrovie del Sud Est (FSE) in 1931 created an additional source of regional traffic, via Martina Franca. Features View of the platforms. The design of the passenger building is influenced by architectural styles that were in vogue in the mid-nineteenth century. It therefore consists of a two-storey central structure with a central clock tower, and two wings extending laterally for form one elevation. The trains stopping at the station range from regional services to InterCity, Eurostar Italia and high speed trains. Most train services are operated by Trenitalia.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands between the River Bain and the A153 road connecting Horncastle with Coningsby. History The church dates from the early 12th century. Alterations and additions were made later during that century, in the late 13th century, and in the 14th and the 15th centuries. In 1842 it was described as \\"an ancient structure, which has suffered much from the hand of time...\\". The church was restored in 1880 and again in 1891, the latter restoration increasing the seating from 67 to 140. It was declared redundant in October 1977. Architecture Norman doorwayalt=A plain wooden door over which is a round arch with a carved tympanum =Exterior= St Benedict's is constructed in greenstone rubble with limestone ashlar dressings. The gables are in red brick, and red brick has been used in places for patching. The roofs are slated, and the bellcote is timber boarded. Its plan consists of a nave with a north aisle and a south porch, and a chancel. The bellcote sits towards the west end of the nave roof. At the west end of the church is a 14th-century doorway above which is a three-light window dating from the 15th century. In the west gable are two re-set medieval stones carved with heads. The north aisle has a two-light window in the north wall, a blocked doorway, a two-light and a three-light window in the north wall, and a three-light window in the east wall. The north wall of the chancel contains a two-light and a three-light window and two blocked ogee-headed windows. The east window has four lights and contains Decorated tracery. In the south wall of the chancel are a two-light and a three-light window, two ogee-headed windows, and an ogee-headed doorway. The south wall of the nave contains a two-light 13th-century window with Y-tracery, The gabled porch dates from the 14th century. It has an arched doorway, stepped angle buttresses with crocketted pinnacles and a cross finial. The inner doorway is Norman in style, with a round head, three orders of roll moulding, and a carved tympanum containing a Maltese cross in a circle, a fan-shaped shell to its left, and a knot in a circle to the right. =Interior= The arcade between the nave and the north aisle has three bays with octagonal piers. The two bays to the east have late-12th-century rounded arches, and the west bay has a pointed arch, probably dating from the 13th century. The chancel arch is pointed and dates from the 19th century. In the chancel are a 14th-century piscina with two ogee arches, four brackets for statues, and an aumbry. The pulpit dates from the 18th century; above it is a tester, and below it are seats in boxes. Arranged around the pulpit are pews dating from various periods facing in different directions. Some of these are family pews which have been reconstructed using wood from a 15th-century screen. The octagonal font dates from the 14th century, its bowl being carved with fleurons. Also inside the church are boards painted with the royal arms of Charles I and biblical texts.

Palawanos are more popularly known as Palawans, which is pronounced faster than the name of the province. Classification They are divided into four ethno-linguistic subgroupings.Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International. Online version: http://www.ethnologue.com/. These are the Quezon Palawano which is also known as the Central Palawano; the Bugsuk Palawano or South Palawano; Brooke's Point Palawano; and Southwest Palawano. The Quezon Palawano subgroup are found in Southern Palawan, particularly on the western section of the municipality of Quezon including the eastern part of Abo-abo of the municipality of Sofronio Espanola, going southward down to the northern section of the municipality of Rizal. A large group of Palawans can also be found in Sitios Gugnan, Kambing, Tugpa, and Kalatabog of Barangay Panitian. The Taw't Bato of the municipality of Rizal at the foot of Mt. Matalingahan also belongs to this same Palawan tribal group although their language is 15 percent different from the Quezon Palawanos. Description The Palawans were originally a nomadic tribe in Southern Palawan until agrarian settlers started to occupy their once vast domain. The tribe would exploit the most fertile piece of land and move on to next. Their family units were very small, possibly due to high mortality rates. They built their houses usually on a hillside but close to the river or stream using four skinny trunks of trees. The floor is roughly 15 to 20 feet from the ground. Families used a slanted log to climb or to enter their houses, except for single or bachelor's shanties where a suspended rope is preferred. They hunt wild animals using spears with a lethal poison at the tip. They catch fish by using a special root sap that is diluted in a shallow stream or river. The tribe hardly domesticate chicken nor hogs although dogs were their favorite pet because they can also be used in hunting. The Palawans do not usually use sea salt on their food. Their usual diet is made up of rice, banana, cassave, vegetables, rimas or breadfruit, fruits, wild pigs from hunting, birds such as wild quails and tikling, wild chicken/labuyo, and freshwater fish. They prepare a delicious festival dish called pinyaram. A kind of cassava or rice cake placed on top of banana leaves that is quite similar to the Tagalog's bibingka. They were naive in socializing with their outside world, and they would welcome you with extreme precaution as they were always scared of getting sick. At the onset of this fear, they would immediately abandon their area. It is believed that they have the shortest life span of all peoples but no statistical data are however available to support this claim. They do not have a concept of year or years. When asked when were they born, they would reference it to a standing tree, explaining that they were born when a particular tree was just about a certain height. Their choices of clothing were g-strings for men and patadyong for women or the so-called native wraps similar to the more popular malong. One of their children's playtoys is a top that is flat, usually about a third of an inch thick that is spun on the ground using a rope of one and a half meters in length. Influences from Agrarian Settlers, Government and NGOs The influx of agrarian settlers in Southern Palawan had gradually influenced the cultural orientation and some of the traditional practices of the Palawan tribe. The way they build their houses had slowly changed adopting more and more the styles of their agrarian settler neighbors. Construction materials however had remained the same. As they become aware of the concept of property rights, they started to build small villages and stopped being nomadic people resulting to little linguistical differences among villages. Studies in 1990s had identified four ethno-linguistic subgroups as mentioned above. However, more studies are needed in order to categorize each of the villages scattered in Southern Palawan. Sizes of their families remained small and life expectancy remained low. They now provide hired labor during rice planting and harvesting periods to lowland farmers. However, their main source of income is rattan gathering or production of yantok which is used in nipa weaving or in the construction of nipa houses. The Palawans are a protected tribal people under the Strategic Environmental Plan (SEP) Law or Republic Act 7611. Section 7 of the law states: :SEP shall establish a graded system of protection and development control over the whole of Palawan, including its tribal lands, forest, mines, agricultural areas, settlement areas, small islands mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds and the surrounding sea. This shall be known as the Environmentally Critical Areas Network, hereinafter referred to as ECAN, and shall serve as the main strategy of the SEP. Item 4 of this section states that the ECAN shall ensure the \\"protection of tribal people and the preservation of their culture\\". The term cultural preservation is a vague language since culture is an evolving part of human existence. Many non-government organizations also advocate the preservation of the tribal culture of Palawans. An abstract term since people always have desires for change, advancement and modernization. This puts a question on what kind of cultural preservation is under the SEP Law. It is certain that the touristic appeal of the tribal people is positively correlated with the preservation of their culture. The more they remain the way they are, the better is the Province's appeal as a tourist destination. Some may view this to be unfair as it benefits the government to deny advancement or influence the tribal people not to aspire to modernize. It lowers their status as a people to merely just a tourist attraction or just a recreational resource. It contradicts the basic human tenet of equality of all peoples regardless of ethnicity or race. PCSD Resolution No. 93-38a, Resolution Adopting the Guidelines for the Identification and Delineation of Ancestral Domain and Land Claims in Palawan could grant land rights to Palawans - an incentive so they would remain indigenous. The Palawans are a socio-economically vulnerable tribe because they still lack basic education. At present this indigenous tribe is working with anti-mining activists and environmental groups to prevent nickel mining concessions from being established in Southern Palawan.The Palawan, Mining threat to remote tribe in Philippines. http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/palawan It is apparent however that the most important things to the lives of Palawans are not being given attention especially by the government such as the need to increase their life expectancy, to provide them with proper education, and to improve their social and economic status. They needed proper clothing to protect them from the elements, medical services, potable water supply, educational services, infrastructure, and livelihood opportunities. Language There are many linguistic variations among Palawan family groups with words changing from one valley to the next (i.e. tabon for mountain verses bukid). Tagalog is frequently used to supply words lacking in the local dialect for modern objects and actions which can cause confusion, especially among the younger generation, between Tagalog and Palawan. The more familiar a family or village is with the Tagalog lowland culture, the more common the language overlap.

The fortifications of the former East Prussian capital K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad) consist of numerous defensive walls, forts, bastions and other structures. They make up the First and the Second Defensive Belt, built in 1626‚Äî1634 and 1843‚Äî1859, respectively. The 15 metre-thick First Belt was erected due to K√∂nigsberg's vulnerability during the Polish‚ÄìSwedish wars. The Second Belt was largely constructed on the place of the first one, which was in a bad condition. The new belt included twelve bastions, three ravelins, seven spoil banks and two fortresses, surrounded by a water moat. Ten brick gates served as entrances and passages through defensive lines and were equipped with moveable bridges. The K√∂nigsberg fortifications became largely obsolete even before the completion of construction due to the rapid development of artillery. Following the military setbacks of Nazi Germany, however, they became strategically important again (particularly during the East Prussian Offensive). Major fortifications =Astronomic Bastion= The Astronomic Bastion was erected in 1855-1860 and got its name because of proximity to the K√∂nigsberg Observatory.

It is a four-acre (1.6-ha) parcel with a walkway and several monuments. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Overview During the Revolutionary War Major John Andr√© of the British Army was captured, disguised in civilian clothing, at the site by three Patriot militiamen. They found papers on him that implicated him in espionage with Benedict Arnold, a high-ranking officer of the Continental Army. After a military trial Andr√© was executed; Arnold defected to the British and lived his remaining years after the war in England. A memorial was erected on the site in 1853, on land donated by some members of the local African American community. It was one of the earliest monuments to honor any event of the Revolutionary War. Later it was expanded and incorporated into Brookside Park, a late 19th-century Beaux-Arts residential development by the firm of Carr√®re and Hastings . Later it became the campus of two different girls' boarding schools, one of which was attended by Lauren Bacall. It became a park and took its current name in the middle of the 20th century, and all buildings but the gatehouse were demolished. Grounds The park is a four- acre (1.6 ha) parcel located between North Broadway (Route 9) on its east, North Washington Street to the west and College Avenue on the north. The southwest corner has some houses continuing down to Wildey Street; Tarrytown's public library is to the southeast. Across North Washington are more houses, which continue to the College intersection at the northwest. Church of the Immaculate Conception is across from the park at College and North Broadway. To the east is the large open lawn of John Paulding School, the public elementary school of the Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns, which has its headquarters north of the school in the former Edward Harden Mansion, also listed on the National Register. Behind them runs the Old Croton Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark. The commercial areas of downtown Sleepy Hollow are two blocks to the north along North Broadway. Topographically the park consists of two slight rises, more pronounced toward the west, reflecting the land's general descent toward the nearby Hudson River. They are divided by the narrow channel followed by Andre Brook, which also forms the boundary between the two villages, Tarrytown to the south and Sleepy Hollow to the north. The land is mostly open, with tall mature trees providing shade opportunities, more in the north of the park than the south. The park's organizing feature is an oval walkway with entrances at the north, east and west, and short paths to a basketball court at the south and North Broadway to the southeast. The main entrance is at the west. It is flanked by two gateposts of rusticated granite blocks. Stone walls in random ashlar with granite copings begin at the posts and follow the sidewalks to create terraces, broken by granite steps to the walkway, on either side of the entrance. They end in granite consoles. In the north terraces is a stone gatehouse, one bay on each side with walls laid in a random ashlar pattern and topped by a cornice line. Atop is a hipped roof shingled in asphalt, with exposed rafter ends. Its entrance is on the west facade; the only window is on the north. South of the west entrance is the Captors' Monument, enclosed by a square iron fence. It consists of two pedestals topped by a bronze statue of John Paulding, one of the local men who apprehended Andr√©. The older lower pedestal is a square block of white Sing Sing marble with a recessed panel on the west side. Inside the panel is a bronze commemorative plaque with a bas- relief depicting Andr√©'s capture. It supports the upper pedestal, a narrowing concrete block, and the statue of Paulding atop that. South of the Captors' Monument is a more modern statue of Christopher Columbus. alt=A decorative stone bridge, with curving stairs down to the water below on either side, in a park Opposite the entrance curving stone steps, along with a sloped walkway from the south, lead down from battered stone piers at either end of a retaining wall to a basin where Andre Brook flows out from a culvert that has carried it under North Broadway and the schools to the east. It emerges from an arch with alternating scaled voussoirs and a scaled keystone in the monochrome ashlar retaining wall on the west side of the walkway. Above it is a balcony supported by two consoles. The brook flows over a dam and west down a concrete-lined channel, paralleled by a stone path on the south bank. Midway along it is a small stone foot bridge, with battered stone piers and an arch, with the same voussoirs as the retaining wall arch but a shouldered keystone. From there it flows over another waterfall and under the drive bridge, similar to the foot bridge but heavier, then into another culvert under North Washington Avenue. There are two playgrounds within the park. A smaller, older one is in the northwest corner, and a newer and larger one in the southwest, near the library. Decorative lamps line the drive, and benches are located around the park. History The park derives its primary importance from the capture of Major Andr√© during the war. The monument was erected in the mid-19th century. After being developed for residential use in the late 19th century, it became home to two girls' schools and finally, today's park, undergoing several renovations in the process. =1780: Capture of Major Andr√©= In 1780, five years from the start of the Revolutionary War, the settlements that would later become the Tarrytowns were in the middle of Neutral Ground, the ‚Äìwide no man's land between British forces occupying New York City (at the time, what is today Lower Manhattan) and the Continental Army north of the Croton River. Gangs of armed bandits roamed the lightly populated area, raiding farms in a search for livestock and other goods they could sell to the warring armies. Those with Loyalist sympathies were called Cow-boys; their counterparts who sold to the Patriots were known as Skinners. On the morning of September 24 that year, three young men‚ÄîJohn Paulding, Isaac Van Wart and David Williams‚Äîset themselves up along the road through Tarrytown, approximately east of where the Captors' Monument is now. They were part of a group of eight Skinners, hoping to ambush a party of Cow-boys. A rider approached them, and they raised their guns to stop him. It was Major John Andr√© of the British Army, returning from a clandestine visit to West Point, where he had been negotiating the terms of a surrender with General Benedict Arnold of the Continental Army. alt=A black-and-white illustration of a man in white, with one boot off, on a stone bridge, surrounded by three darker men with hats, coats and long guns Paulding, who had recently escaped from British custody, wore a Hessian coat he had taken in the process, which led Andr√© to assume, in the ensuing conversation, that the three were Cow-boys who could thus aid him in continuing on to New York. When informed of his mistake, he produced a pass signed by Arnold. The three searched him and found papers in his boots, not only his correspondence with Arnold but diagrams of the defenses at West Point. Paulding, the only literate member of the trio, read them and realized quickly that Andr√© was a spy. Williams asked Andr√© what money he could pay them, but Paulding quickly ended any talk of a payoff, swearing that not even 10,000 guineas would be enough. After Andr√© was turned over to the Continental command at North Castle, he was taken across the Hudson to Tappan where he was held prisoner. After being convicted of espionage at a military trial in the DeWint House (today a National Historic Landmark), he was hanged by order of George Washington, who had attended the trial. Had Andr√© successfully conveyed the information Arnold had given him to New York, the British could have managed to secure the Hudson and cut New England off from the other rebellious colonies, resolving the stalemate of the time in their favor and drastically changing the outcome of the war. Arnold, tipped off about Andr√©'s arrest by a member of his staff unaware of his commander's involvement, was able to escape to the British with his family. After holding some commands in the British Army, he emigrated to England at war's end, where he was buried two decades later. Paulding, Van Wart and Williams were recognized and compensated for their roles in the capture. The Continental Congress awarded them lifetime pensions and the Fidelity Medallion, generally considered the first U.S. military decoration; the state gave them farms confiscated from Loyalists. Two decades later, three counties in the new state of Ohio were named after them. Later the elementary school near the memorial would take Paulding's name as well. =1853‚Äì1942: homes and schools= David Williams, the sole survivor of the trio that captured Major John Andre, died in 1831. After his death, a movement began to build a monument at the capture site. It never gained enough support, but never completely disappeared either. In 1852 the Monument Association to the Captors of Major Andr√© was formally established at last, and it was able to bring those plans to fruition. A local freed African American couple, William and Mary Taylor, donated the property they owned at the intersection of the brook and the highway. The cornerstone was laid on Independence Day, July 4, 1853. Among those at the ceremony were Alexander Hamilton's son James, and Horatio Seymour and Henry J. Raymond, governor and lieutenant governor of New York, respectively. The lower pedestal was raised shortly thereafter, of marble quarried in nearby Sing Sing, today Ossining. It was topped with an obelisk. alt=A tall stone pedestal with a metallic figure atop it, with two large trees above it. The base is surrounded by an iron fence. In the front right is a blue marker with yellow type headed \\"Andr√© Captured\\", over smaller type describing that event. On the centennial of the capture in 1880, the monument was expanded and rededicated. A crowd of 70,000 attended the ceremony, presided over by Samuel J. Tilden (one of his last public appearances) and Chauncey Depew. The obelisk was replaced with the current concrete block and topped with a statue of Paulding by William R. O'Donovan, donated by a Tarrytown resident. At that time there were three houses across North Broadway, dating to at least 1865. They were demolished to clear the way for an 1892 plan to incorporate the monument into Brookside Park, a new residential development. Carr√®re and Hastings designed eight wood and stone Beaux-Arts cottages and a stone gatehouse, meant to blend in with the site, and laid out the park's extant landscaping, its symmetry and grandiose treatment of the basin characteristic of their chosen style. By the end of the year all were completed, at a cost of $10,000 ($ in modern dollars) apiece. Developer Eugene Jones intended to lease the units individually rather than sell them. In 1896 he sold them to Amos Clark, who continued to lease out the cottages until renting the property to the recently established Knox School for Girls in 1911. It named the buildings, which housed its 42 students, after roses. By the end of the decade Knox had outgrown Brookside, and moved to a new campus in Cooperstown. In 1920 another girls' school, Highland Manor, moved in. Among the students to attend Highland Manor was Lauren Bacall, later a successful actress. In 1942, as its predecessor had, the school moved to a larger campus elsewhere. Two local women bought the park, had all but one of the neglected cottages demolished, and then donated the property to the two villages. At that time it was renamed to Patriot's Park. =1943‚Äìpresent: park= After World War II ended, three local garden clubs formed a committee to guide the restoration of the park. Following a plan by a still-unidentified architect, the foundations of the demolished houses were filled in and planted in 1949. Over the next six years further improvements were made. New paved paths were created, dead trees replaced with younger dogwoods and the brook channel lined with concrete. All the masonry was reset and repointed. The remaining house from Brookside Park was used as a gymnasium and storage area until it was demolished around 1970. The gatehouse is the only building left from that development. As of 1982 the villages of Tarrytown and North Tarrytown (as Sleepy Hollow was known until changing its name in the early 1990s) both allocated a thousand dollars a year to the park's maintenance.

Actual technical vocational training began in Helsinki after a legislative reform in 1858. The technical trade departments of engineering, mechanical engineering, architecture, chemical technology and surveying were founded at the same time. In 1872 the school was renamed the Polytechnic School and in 1879 the Polytechnic Institute. In 1877 the Polytechnic School moved to its own premises when the building next to Hietalahti Market was completed. The main extensions of the main building were completed in 1904 and 1927. The Polytechnic Institute was made a university- level school in 1908 and renamed the Technological University of Finland. The first degree at the university was either one of an engineer, surveyor or architect. The title 'diploma engineer' ‚Äì which corresponds to a M.Sc. degree ‚Äì was adopted in the early 1940s in conjunction of a syllabus reform at the same time as the lower technical degrees were defined. Move to Otaniemi After the Second World War the city blocks available began to be much too small. The final decision to move the University out of the city was made in 1948. Next year, the State bought the lands of Otaniemi Manor in the eastern part of the rural municipality of Espoo to serve as the new campus. Development began in Otaniemi with housing for students, called Teekkarikyl√§ or student village. Its first residents were not students, however, but athletes taking part in 1952 Helsinki Summer Olympics. The first functions of the University moved to Espoo in 1955. The main part of the main building was completed in 1964 and the move from Hietalahti was finalised ten years later. In the 1950s and '60s Otaniemi became one of the most interesting sites of Finnish architecture. Architect Alvar Aalto made the general plan of the campus and he was in charge of the main building and the Otahalli sports hall and of several other buildings. Reima Pietil√§ and Raili Paatelainen designed Dipoli, and the office of Heikki and Kaija Siren designed the oldest dormitories, the Servin M√∂kki restaurant and the Otaniemi chapel. Part of the Aalto University In 2010 the Aalto University was created from the merger of the Helsinki University of Technology, the Helsinki School of Economics, and The University of Art and Design Helsinki.

The memoirs are a first-hand account of her life through the Ancien R√©gime, the French Revolution, and the Imperial court of Napoleon, ending in March 1815 with Napoleon's return from exile on Elba. Her memoirs serve as unique testimony to much unchronicled history. Life =Early life= Henriette- Lucy Dillon was born into a prominent Irish Wild Geese Jacobite military family in France. She was daughter of Arthur Dillon, colonel-proprietor of the Dillon Regiment, and the lady-in-waiting Therese-Lucy de Rothe (1751‚Äì1782). Her father had been born in England, so she was often regarded in France as English. However the family, of Norman descent, was linked to the Dillons of Costello-Gallen and the lords of Drumraney in Ireland, who were granted lands in County Westmeath in the thirteenth-century. Following her mother's death and her father's subsequent posting abroad, where he remarried, Lucie lived in the household of her grandmother, Mme. de Rothe, and Arthur Richard Dillon, Archbishop of Narbonne, until marrying and joining the Court of France. She married , later Marquis de La Tour-du-Pin, an army officer and diplomat, in 1787. He was the son of Jean-Fr√©d√©ric de la Tour du Pin-Gouvernet, a French Minister of War. Following her mother she served as an apprentice lady-in- waiting (Dame du Palais surnumeraire) to Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, from the age of 16 in 1787, until 1789. =During the revolution= She was present at Versailles during the Assembly of the Estates, and witnessed the Women's March on Versailles at the outbreak of the French revolution. She also witnessed the peasant uprising called the Great Fear in the countryside. Between October 1791 and March 1792, her husband served as ambassador in the Hague, where she joined him, returning to France only in December 1792. During the Reign of Terror of Robespierre in 1793, many of her friends and family were executed and she fled Paris for the family estate of Le Bouilh, or Saint Andr√© Bouilh Cubzac in the Gironde region. During the summer of that year, their estate was seized by the government, and her husband was imprisoned. She managed to secure his release from Jean-Lambert Tallien by the help of Th√©r√©sa Tallien. Directly after his release, she, aged 24, and her husband passed into exile for a new life on a dairy farm near Albany in Upstate New York. Although they were never officially listed as √©migr√©s, Fr√©d√©ric had been living in hiding prior to departure. She described this time as the happiest of her life. She vividly describes the reality of owning slaves and interactions with the local Dutch families and the few remaining Native Americans of the area. She was close to Talleyrand during his exile in the United States, and she returned to France as he did after the establishment of the Directorate, in 1796. The couple left the United States because her husband wanted to resume his career in public life and shore up the family fortunes. =Later life= After the French coup of 1799, which brought Napoleon to power, her husband was able to resume his diplomatic career. She was able to promote his career under Napoleon, who was looking for aristocrats to lend legitimacy to his power and, from 1804, his court. Her memoirs described an insider's view of many events from the Imperial court of Napoleon. She continued to follow her husband to his various diplomatic appointments after the Bourbon Restoration. They went into effective exile again after their son Aymar became involved in the anti-Orl√©anist plot of Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry, in 1831, in the Vend√©e. Aymar escaped France, but was condemned to death in his absence. The family sold its possessions in France soon after. Following her husband's death in Lausanne, Switzerland in 1837, she moved to Italy, where she died in Pisa, Italy Legacy Her memoir was written as a letter to her only surviving child after the age of fifty. It remained in the family and was not published until 1906. She is the subject of a biography by Caroline Moorehead published in 2009.

Its origin dates back to as early as 1903. Today, the paper is one of only four campus publications in the country that publishes on a weekly basis. Its office is situated at the ground floor of Oriental Hall, SU Campus along Hibbard Avenue.\\"About Us\\". The Weekly Sillimanian. Retrieved 2011-08-11. History =Establishment= the Weekly Sillimanian traces its origins to the launching of the first campus publication of the then Silliman Institute named as Silliman Truth. As the first periodical in the Province of Negros Oriental at that time, the little magazine that it was served both the public and the campus. Copies were mailed to the Presbyterian Board and to other subscribers. Varied in terms of content, the publication was multilingual. English, Spanish and Cebuano were interchangeably used. The initial copies of the magazine were printed using a small press purchased by Dr. David Hibbard but later, copies were printed using a much larger press after a $400 grant was received by the Institute from Dr. Horace Silliman. During the early years of the Silliman Truth (1903‚Äì1918), the publication was edited primarily by American missionaries. However, in August 1918 a decision was made to assign the editing to Junior and Senior English students. This evolved the paper from being a missionary-edited publication to that of a student organ. =Transformation= By the year 1920, the missionary-founded Silliman Truth was foreshadowed by the emergence of an outright student periodical bearing the name Sillimanian. Published twice a week, the paper became the official student organ of Silliman University. In the absence of a regular alumni publication during that period, the Sillimanian became an effective tool in updating the alumni of events that transpire in the campus and vice versa. The Silliman Truth on the other hand was transformed as a monthly periodical, serving as the official publication of the University's Board of Trustees. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the Sillimanian became a daily newspaper and was published both in English and Cebuano, becoming at that time as the voice of the resistance movement in the province against the Japanese occupation. In 1958, the school paper first competed in the Columbia Scholastic Press Association Contest in Columbia University, a member of the Ivy League, and won several First Place awards.\\"Dumaguete Timeline\\" . Department of Trade and Industry. Retrieved 2011-04-22. In 1967, the daily Sillimanian became a weekly and served primarily as a school publication. Due to lack of a regular and reliable community periodical in Dumaguete during that period, the Sillimanian continued to contain a community portion where events of Dumaguete and Negros Oriental are published. In the 1970s, an experiment was made to hand over total control of the paper to the student body. The position of a faculty adviser was abolished and because of this administrative action, the school paper eventually fell into the hands of militant activists. When Martial Law was declared by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1972, the office of the Sillimanian was raided by the Philippine Constabulary (now the Philippine National Police) and was closed down for three years. =Weekly Sillimanian= After school papers in the country were allowed to resume in 1974, the Sillimanian was revived as a fortnightly in 1975 and resumed as a weekly in June 1976. Since its resumption, the Sillimanian has been referred to as the Weekly Sillimanian and continues to be named as such today. At times, it is abbreviated with three letters: a small letter \\"t\\" and two capitalized letters \\"W\\" and \\"S\\" forming tWS. At present, the school paper is assigned with a faculty adviser and placed under supervision of the University's Office of Information and Publications. The tWS office is currently situated at the Oriental Hall, SU Campus, Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental, Philippines.

The natural gas flame in a one-ton bronze urn is atop a tower on a stone pedestrian terrace with views from the terraced hill summit over about , and the flame is visible from away. History In 1887, \\"the Philadelphia Brigade, Col. Cowan and others\\" advocated a \\"grand monument to American Heroism on this battlefield\\",col. 4 and President William McKinley spoke to Cowan about North/South peace in 1900.The New York Times, March 24, 1900, p. 3. The \\"first tentative program\\" of October 1910 for the 1913 Gettysburg reunion planned a \\"Peace Jubilee\\" to be held on \\"National Day\\" with an oration by President Woodrow Wilson and the cornerstone placement for the \\"Great Peace Memorial\\" at noon. However, after being \\"presented, January 11th, 1912, to the Joint Committee of the Congress [for] the Celebration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg\\", funding was \\"found, in March 1912, impossible of accomplishment in the 62nd Congress\\". Instead of the laying of a cornerstone, on July 3 during the New York Veterans' Celebration in the 1913 Great Tent, Colonel Andrew Cowan gave a speech advocating the memorial, and \\"steps to accomplish such purpose were immediately taken ‚Ä¶ which resulted in the Gettysburg Peace Memorial Association being formed. ‚Ä¶ That Association's Bill was, on December 20th, 1913, presented to Congress‚Ä¶creating the Gettysburg Memorial Commission.\\" The original plan was for a $250,000 \\"monument of peace\\" at The Angle, but despite 1914 \\"Peace Memorial Bill\\" presentations to the US House of Representatives that compared the planned memorial with Christ the Redeemer of the Andes and the Lincoln Memorial, federal funding remained \\"postponed\\". In August 1936, the memorial's commission issued 10,000 four page circulars to publicize the plan, and Virginia in 1936 was the first to appropriate funds. In 1937 the Pennsylvania legislature began planning a peace memorial on Big Round Top, and the state's \\"Peace Memorial Bill\\" was signed on February 24, 1937, to appropriate $5,000 for the state's \\"Gettysburg Peace Memorial fund\\". The peace memorial committee selected from the 6 designs by August 1937 and on December 10, 1937, Lee Lawrie was announced as the sculptor for the structure \\"overlooking Big Round Top [and] Little Round Top\\". With additional funding by New York, Indiana, Tennessee, Illinois, and Wisconsin; the $60,000 monument was instead completed northwest of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. Groundbreaking was on February 14, and the last foot of piping for the flame's gas supply was placed on May 31. =Dedication= Attendance for the memorial's dedication at the 1938 Gettysburg reunion on July 3 was 250,000; a further 100,000 attempted to attend but failed to arrive due to congested roads. President Franklin D. Roosevelt arrived at a temporary platform on his special train via the Reading Railroad from the North after leaving Springwood at Hyde Park NY that morning. The U.S. 3d Cavalry Division escorted the President's motorcade to the memorial on Oak Hill, and Roosevelt's open car arrived with a 21 gun salute. Roosevelt used \\"a new Mobile sound system unit\\" to address the audience including the veterans on specially-constructed grandstands under a canopy. As his nine-minute speech ended at sunset, the Peace Memorial covered by a 50-foot flag was unveiled by George N. Lockwood and Confederate A. G. Harris (both age 91) with two regular army attendants a photocell automatically lit the flame Grand Army of the Republic chaplain Martin V. Stone ended the ceremony with a benediction prayer, and on the way to his car Roosevelt spoke with the oldest attending veteran, William Barnes of the US Colored Troops, age 112. A Sixth Field Artillery battery near Oak Hill fired a 21 gun salute as the President departed at 7 p.m. (his train to Washington used the Western Maryland Railway. The flame was reduced to a pilot light during World War II (from December 25, 1941) and just prior to the 1946 Paris peace conference, President Truman commented about the inscribed motto, Peace Eternal in a Nation United: \\"That is what we want, but let's change that word (nation) to world and we'll have something.\\" The deteriorated Alabama limestone in the lower section that had been approved for use by the Bureau of Standards was replaced with gray granite in June 1941, and repairs were also made in 1950. A 1962 protest against nuclear arms and testing was held at the memorial, and the flame was extinguished in 1974 for the oil crisis after the 93rd United States Congress prohibited such flames (except for the John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame), and the extinguished gas flame was replaced by an electrical light in 1976. A Gettysburg Peace Celebration committee had been formed by June 1988, and the gas flame was restored at their Fiftieth Anniversary Rededication on July 3.

A member of Poland Comes First (PjN), Migalski was elected to the European Parliament at the 2009 election for Law and Justice (PiS). He never joined the party, and his open criticism of PiS leader Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski led to his expulsion from the party's group and the creation of the more moderate PjN in late 2010. Professional career Migalski taught Polish before studying political science at the University of Silesia, graduating in 1999. In that year, he was appointed deputy director of Euroregion Cieszyn Silesia, while earning his doctorate from the University of Silesia, which he was granted in 2001 for his thesis A Bridge Between East and West: Edvard Bene≈° ‚Äì An Attempt to Preserve the Independence of Czechoslovakia in 1945-1948. He taught at the University of Silesia in Katowice, as well as the Humanitas Academy in Sosnowiec. As a political scientist, Migalski was well known for his conservative views, as well as the accuracy of his predictions. In 2009, he ran for the European Parliament for Law and Justice, in the Silesian constituency. He was elected, winning 112,881 votes. However, he did not become a member of the party, and was seen as a moderate within the group. Member of the European Parliament In September 2009, he strongly condemned Roman Polanski, whose charge for statutory rape in the United States divided Poland. With Civic Platform MEP S≈Çawomir Nitras, in January 2010, Migalski co- authored a resolution that would name the Katyn massacre a 'genocide'. In July 2010, he led a boycott of the beer Lech, after the brand was advertised with an allusion to Lech Kaczy≈Ñski's death. In August 2010, he came out in criticism of Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, blaming Kaczy≈Ñski for Law and Justice's poor poll ratings in a five-page open letter. The open letter divided the party, with more moderate, younger figures in the PiS, including Joanna Kluzik- Rostkowska and Pawe≈Ç Poncyljusz, both of whom Migalski mentioned in his letter, siding with Migalski. Migalski was ejected from the party's European Parliament delegation the following week, in a resolution written by Ryszard Legutko and Tomasz Porƒôba. The split led to three members of the Sejm ‚Äì Kluzik-Rostkowska, Poncyljusz, and El≈ºbieta Jakubiak ‚Äì being ejected from the party.

According to the theory, a judge who encounters a conflict between a statute and what he perceives as just, has to decide against applying the statute if ‚Äì and only if ‚Äì the legal concept behind the statute in question seems either \\"unbearably injust\\" or in \\"deliberate disregard\\" of human equality before the law. Radbruch's formula is rooted in the situation of a civil law system. It is believed to be a reaction to Radbruch's experience of the judiciary in Nazi Germany and has been applied in the decision of courts in the Federal Republic of Germany numerous times. By some authors, the Radbruch essay Gesetzliches Unrecht und √ºbergesetzliches Recht, which first included his theory, is regarded as one of the most influential German legal-philosophical writings of the 20th century.For example S. Paulson and R. Dreier, 'Einf√ºhrung in die Rechtsphilosophie Radbruchs', in: Gustav Radbruch: Rechtsphilosophie, Studienausgabe (Heidelberg, 1999), pp. 235‚Äì250 Formation and content Before the Second World War, Radbruch seems to have been a supporter of unconditional legal positivism, which demands a strict separation between law and morality. In consequence, judges would have to apply positive law (i.e. statutes) without exception. The experience of the Third Reich (where Radbruch, then a professor, was banned from teaching), seemed to have modified Radbruch's view. Shortly after the end of the war, Radbruch first stated his formula in a 1946 essay: Excerpt: Excerpt (translation): Radbruch restated his concept in the book Vorschule der Rechtsphilosophie (published posthumously). Reception in court Both the German Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Court of Justice have applied Radbruch's formula numerous times. Its first court appearances were in cases concerned with National Socialist crimes. The defendants in those cases argued that, according to National Socialist statutes valid at the time of their actions, their deeds were legal. The courts used Radbruch's formula to argue that some statutes had been so intolerable that they had not been law in the first place and consequently could not be used to justify the deeds in question. More recently, the Radbruch formula reappeared in trials against East German soldiers, ordered to protect the inner-German border.

The scale and associated measurement technique were proposed by the English potter Josiah Wedgwood in the 18th century. The measurement was based on the shrinking of clay when heated above red heat, and the shrinking was evaluated by comparing heated and unheated clay cylinders. The scale started at being 0¬∞ Wedgwood and had 240 steps of . Both the origin and the step were later found inaccurate. History The boiling point of mercury limits the mercury-in- glass thermometer to temperatures below 356 ¬∞C, which is too low for many industrial applications such as pottery, glass making and metallurgy. To solve this problem, the English potter Josiah Wedgwood proposed, in the 18th century, a method to measure temperatures in his kilns. His method and temperature scale were then widely adopted in science and technical applications. They were abandoned after the invention of accurate types of pyrometer, for example the pyrometer of John Frederic Daniell in 1830. Method A device for converting the diameter of the annealed clay cylinder into the Wedgwood temperature. A 0.5-inch-diameter cylinder made from pipe clay was dried at the temperature of boiling water. This would prepare it for heating in the oven in which the temperature was to be measured. During the annealing, sintering (merging) of fine particles resulted in contraction of clay. After cooling, the temperature was evaluated from the diameter difference before and after heating assuming that the contraction is linear with temperature. To facilitate the temperature calculation, Wedgwood built a device which would directly read the temperature. Two metal bars with scales on them were fixed one above another on a metal plate and inclined at a small angle. The spacing between the bars was 0.5 inches at one end and 0.3 inches at the lower end. The scale was divided into 240 equidistant parts. The unheated piece of clay would fit the 0.5-inch gap giving the zero temperature reading. After annealing, the clay cylinder would shrink and fit somewhere in between the left and right ends of the bars, and the temperature could be read from the scales on the bars. Scale The origin (0¬∞) on Wedgwood scale was set at the onset temperature of red heat, . The scale had 240 steps of and extended up to . Wedgwood tried to compare his scale with other scales by measuring the expansion of silver as a function of temperature. He also determined the melting points of three metals, namely copper (27 ¬∞W or ), silver (28 ¬∞W or ) and gold (32 ¬∞W or ). All these values are at least too high. Corrections Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau used his pyrometer to evaluate the temperature scale of Wedgwood and came to the conclusion that the starting point should be significantly lower, at instead of , and that the steps should be nearly halved from to no more than . However, even after this revision the Wedgwood measurements overestimated the melting points of elements.

Mesolongi lagoon on the background. Pleuron (; , Plevrona or ŒëœÉœÜŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒ≤ŒøœçŒΩŒπ, Asfakovouni) was a city in ancient Aetolia, Greece. The name refers to two settlements, the older of which was at the foot of Mount Curium between the river Acheloos and the river Evenos, and was mentioned by Homer in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad. The territory of Pleuron was called Pleuronia.Auson. Epitaph. 10. The ruins of this more ancient city are north of the newer one and consist of a few remnants of Cyclopean walls. Old Pleuron (·º° œÄŒ±ŒªŒ±Œπ·Ω∞ Œ†ŒªŒµœÖœÅœéŒΩ) was situated in the plain between the Achelous and the Evenus, west of Calydon, at the foot of Mount Curium, from which the Curetes are said to have derived their name. Pleuron and Calydon were the two chief towns of Aetolia in the heroic age, and are said by Strabo to have been the ancient ornament (œÄœÅœåœÉœáŒ∑ŒºŒ±) of Greece. Pleuron was originally a town of the Curetes, and its inhabitants were engaged in frequent wars with the Aetolians of the neighbouring town of Calydon. The Curetes, whose attack upon Calydon is mentioned in an episode of the Iliad, appear to have been the inhabitants of Pleuron. At the time of the Trojan War, however, Pleuron was an Aetolian city, and its inhabitants sailed against Troy under the command of the Aetolian chief Thoas, the son (not the grandson) of Oeneus. Ephorus related that the Curetes were expelled from Pleuronia, which was formerly called Curetis, by Aeolians;ap. and this tradition may also be traced in the statement of Thucydides that the district, called Calydon and Pleuronia in the time of the Peloponnesian War, formerly bore the name of Aeolis. Since Pleuron appears as an Aetolian city in the later period of the heroic age, it is represented in some traditions as such from the beginning. Hence it is said to have derived its name from Pleuron, a son of Aetolus; and at the very time that some legends represent it as the capital of the Curetes, and engaged in war with Oeneus, king of Calydon, others suppose it to have been governed by the Aetolian Thestius, the brother of Oeneus. Thestius was also represented as a descendant of Pleuron; and hence Pleuron had an heroum or a chapel at Sparta, as being the ancestor of Leda, the daughter of Thestius. But there are all kinds of variations in these traditions. Thus we find in Sophocles Oeneus, and not Thestius, represented as king of Pleuron.Apollod. 1.7.7; Soph. Trach. 7; One of the tragedies of Phrynichus, the subject of which appears to have been the death of Meleager, the son of Oeneus, was entitled Œ†ŒªŒµœÖœÅœéŒΩŒπŒ±Œπ, or the \\"Pleuronian Women;\\" and hence it is not improbable that Phrynichus, as well as Sophocles, represented Oeneus as king of Pleuron. Pleuron is rarely mentioned in the historical period. It was the birthplace of the ancient Greek poet Alexander Aetolus. It was abandoned by its inhabitants, says Strabo in 234 BCE, in consequence of the ravages of Demetrius II Aetolicus, the Aetolian, a surname probably given to Demetrius II, king of Macedon (who reigned 239-229 BCE), to distinguish him from Demetrius Poliorcetes. The ruins of Old Pleuron are located at near modern Gyphtokastro/Petrovouni at . After the destruction, the inhabitants founded New Pleuron (·º° ŒΩŒµœâœÑŒ≠œÅŒ± Œ†ŒªŒµœÖœÅœéŒΩ) was situated at the foot of Mount Aracynthus. The founder of the city was most probably Pantaleon of Pleuron, strategos of the Aetolian League in 242/41, 235/34, 228/27, 222/21 and 214/13 BCE. Some time after the defeat of the Aetolian League in the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War, the citizens of Pleuron asked the Roman Senate a special permission to join the Achaean League. After the Achaean defeat and the destruction of Corinth in 146 BCE Pleuron became part of the Roman Republic. During the Imperial age the uprisings in Aetolia continued. New Pleuron has been identified in the locality of the castle of ŒöœÖœÅŒØŒ±œÇ Œï·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑œÇ. The remains\\"Pleuron: recent archaeology!\\", http://eu.camperistas.com/1139/pleuron-kalidona/ are located a few kilometers north of the modern city of Missolonghi (and just west of the ancient city of Calydon, with which is it sometimes associated). The ruins of New Pleuron are located at . The city occupies a terrace at over 200m altitude, and is linked to the sea by a defence wall that also encircles the ancient port of Elaius. The city wall is rectangular with 7 gates and 31 towers. The masonry is well preserved almost everywhere and partly trapezoidal, partly pseudo-isodomic with squared faces and datable to . The acropolis occupies the upper part of the site, but little remains. A Byzantine chapel was built on the remains of the Temple of Athena. The civil buildings are to the south. The theatre is in the south-west part of the city with the proscenium built against the city wall. The central part of the building housing the skena is a tower. The proscenium had six columns, and the parascenia must have been elevated above it and must have leaned against the wall. The circle of the orchestra is tangental to the skena. The cavea, well preserved at the north, had five sections and six staircases. The construction of the theatre is contemporary with the walls. Other areas recognisable in the city include the site of the agora, with a long stoa, and the gymnasium. To the south east was a large communal cistern () with five rectangular basins. There are also remains of unidentifiable public buildings and extensive remnants of houses and cisterns. The necropolis extends to the south of the city.

Nasik conspiracy case Anant Laxman Kanhere, a 17-year-old student of Aurangabad, shot Jackson on 21 December 1909 at a theater where a drama was to stage in his honor on the eve of his transfer. It is said that he was shot dead as he had committed Ganesh Savarkar (an Indian freedom-fighter and elder brother of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar ) to trial. However, he was sympathetic towards Indian aspirations, was a scholar of Sanskrit and was popular as a man of learning and culture. The murder created a great deal of sensation in Nashik, Pune and Mumbai and it even created consternation in the ranks of Indian Nationalists, because of Jackson's reputation as a very sympathetic and popular district officer. Though many Indians could not understand why such a good man was murdered the reason is thought to be that Jackson was aware of activities carried by Abhinav Bharat Society which were seditious (as defined by the British Indian government). The arrest of Babarao Savarkar for printing a 16-page book of songs of Kavi Govind and his prosecution was the last straw. Jackson was instrumental in getting Babarao arrested and prosecuted. A group headed by Krishnaji Karve decided to eliminate Jackson in the first month of 1910. However, by the end of 1909, Jackson was promoted to the post of Commissioner of Mumbai. Krishnaji Karve, Vinayak Deshpande, and Anant Kanhere decided to eliminate Jackson before his transfer. People in Nashik arranged a farewell for Jackson at Vijayanand theatre in Nashik and staged a drama, 'Sharada', in his honor. Anant decided this was the time to execute their plan. He took responsibility for killing Jackson and decided to commit suicide by poison to avoid capture and save his other partners. The backup plan was that Vinayak was going to shoot Jackson if Anant's attempt failed. If both these failed, Karve was also carrying a weapon. On 21 December 1909, Jackson came to see the play named 'Sangeet Sharada'. Anant jumped in front of him and shot four bullets. Jackson was killed immediately. One of the Indian officers, Mr. Palshikar and formor DSP Mr. Marutrao Toradmal, attacked Anant with his baton. Other people around caught Anant and he was not able to shoot himself or get the poison. Anant Kanhere, then 18 years old, was prosecuted in Bombay court and hanged in the Thane prison on 19 April 1910, a mere four months after Jackson was killed. Along with Anant, Krishnaji Karve and Vinayak Deshpande were also hanged. None of the relatives of these three were present during the execution. Their bodies were burnt by the prison officers, rather than being released to the families, and the 'Asthi' (Ash left after the body is burnt) was also not handed over to their relatives but were thrown in the sea near Thane.

Const√¢ncio died when he was twelve, adversely affected the Mello family's fortunes, and brought about difficult times for the entire family. The income generated from the family properties managed by the caretaker was insufficient to meet the family's needs and consequently, the young Froilano had to work while he studied. He graduated in Panjim as a medical doctor, and later repeated the course at Porto, Portugal. In 1910, he returned to Goa with an additional diploma in Tropical medicine of the University of Lisbon. Academic and scientific career Captain de Mello in uniform (seated extreme left) attending the third entomological meeting at Pusa in 1919 Mello's academic career got a start in 1910, at the age of 23, when he was appointed as a professor at the prestigious Goa Medical College. From 1913‚Äì14, he served as an assistant professor at the University of Sorbonne in Paris, and was a visiting Professor at the University of Porto in 1921. Mello was promoted to the post of director of the Goa Medical College's Bacteriological institute, a small shed in Campal which would serve as the center of his scientific research from 1914‚Äì1945. His achievements in microbiology and parasitology made the institute world-famous largely because he ensured that all his works were simultaneously published in English, Portuguese and French. Mello would later go on to become the college's dean. During the same period, he also served as Chief of Public Health for Portuguese India. He undertook a postgraduate course in parasitology in Kaiser Willhelm Institute fuer Biologie, Berlin, and at the Max Planck Institute, Potsdam, Germany from 1922‚Äì23. In 1922, at the age of 35, Mello became a Colonel in the Portuguese Army Medical Corps, achieving the highest rank in the medical military hierarchy of that time, exclusively through merits in the medical campaigns on Public Health which he carried out in Goa, Daman, Diu, and in Angola. Mello was the head of a Portuguese delegation to the World Leprosy Conference in Cuba and is known to have attended at least 40 World Conferences, including the All India Sanitary Conference in Lucknow (1914) and the Third Entomological Meeting in Lucknow (1914) where, at the invitation of the Governor-General of India, he lectured on medical mycology. His researches in tropical medicine brought him international fame and recognition as a world-renowned expert on the subject. Mello published more than 200 research papers on bacteriology in Portuguese, French and English journals. He founded the following medical journals in Goa, Boletim Geral de Medicina, Arquivos Indo-Portugueses de Medicina e Historia Natural, and Arquivos da Escola Medico‚ÄìCirurgica de Nova Goa. His work in French entitled, A la veille du Centenaire (On the eve of the Centenary) elaborated in great detail the contributions of Goa Medical College during the first hundred years of its establishment. Separate from his medical career, Mello also authored a book in 1946 on the Bengali poet, Rabindranath Tagore entitled O Cantico da Vida na Poesia Tagoreana (The song of life in the poetry of Tagore). Mello was a member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal; the Indian Academy of Sciences; Societie de Pathologie Exotique and Societie de Biologie de Paris in Paris; Sociedade de Ciencias Medicas, Sociedade de Etnologia & Antropologia and Sociedade de Geografia in Lisbon. He was the recipient of medals of honour from Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands in 1938, Pope Pius XII on the occasion of the canonisation of St. John de Brito in 1947, President Ram√≥n Grau of Cuba in 1949, and from President Eurico Gaspar Dutra of Brazil in 1950. He also held the following Portuguese honours: Grande Official da Ordem de Aviz, Comendador da Ordem de S√£o Tiago and Comendador da Ordem de Benemerencia. Medical campaigns Mello worked passionately to eradicate tuberculosis in Goa and malaria from Velha Goa. His efforts towards this end, led to the establishment of two important institutions, namely the first leprosarium in Asia at Macas·∫öna in Salcette in 1934, today known as Leprosaria Froilano de Mello and Dispensario Virgem Peregrina at St. Inez, Panjim. He also established the TB sanitarium in Margao in 1928 and opened a ward for those suffering from leprosy in Daman. In 1926, Mello with the help of one of his pupils, Dr. Lu√≠s Bras de Sa, carefully mapped the site of Old Goa and recognised more than 4,800 wells in the area, which were breeding grounds of anopheles mosquitoes. This led to the closure of these wells, and in turn, led to the reduction of the mosquito breeding sites. This factor played a significant role in curbing the Malaria epidemic in Goa in the 1920s. Mello also undertook new measures to improve urban sanitation, which included the introduction of Sanitary Police in Panjim. Faced with the task of dealing with the city's rabies epidemic during his term as mayor, he ordered the elimination of all stray dogs, offering a reward per stray dog. This resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of cases of rabies. A similar reward was offered for the capture or destruction of venomous snakes, which led to the reduction of snakebites. Mayor of Panjim (1938‚Äì45) In 1926, Mello was elected as a member of parliament to represent Portuguese India in Lisbon. However, after the 28 May 1926 coup d'√©tat, the elections were nullified and not held again for the next nineteen years. Mello served as the mayor of Panjim from 1938‚Äì45. During his tenure as mayor, he cleansed its stables of mismanagement and fiscal deficits, and his mayorship is widely noted for the city's urbanisation. In 1940, Mello devised a plan for the beautification of the city, particularly the church square, the present 18 June road and the Campal Zone. The latter still bears the imprint of the program carried out by him. He organised the balustrade on the Mandovi River, from the centre of town up to Campal, lining the riverside avenue. He also planted trees in many of the streets of Panjim, with seeds of tropical trees from Cuba. These jacaranda and acacia trees, whose seedlings were planted in 1940, now provide shade to the streets which were originally lined only with coconut and ficus trees. Member of Parliament (1945‚Äì49) In 1945, when the Portuguese parliament was re-opened, Mello was elected for the second time as MP to represent Portuguese India. He was the only independent MP to serve in the Portuguese parliament for the period 1945‚Äì49; all the others being members of dictator Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar's Uni√£o Nacional party. However, Mello's independent status brought him into disfavour with Salazar, and his speeches in the National Assembly were censored. Initially, Mello was staunchly pro-Portuguese and believed that Goa should remain under the Portuguese Empire. In November 1946, at a National Assembly meeting at Lisbon, he denounced the unrest in Goa as the handiwork of a few \\"Fifth Columnists and Nazis, and intellectuals educated in central Europe and fanatics who had failed in life, who preach the absorption of Goa and foment hatred of the Portuguese nation.\\"\\"Fifth Columnist in Goa\\", 1 December 1946, The Colonial Times, Kenya He worked tirelessly for the repeal of the discriminatory Portuguese Colonial Act of 1930, which had previously relegated non-Portuguese citizens to second-class status in the Empire. The repeal of this discriminatory act was unanimously approved by the National Assembly in 1950. With the repeal of the act granted, Mello now began to advocate independence for the Portuguese Indian colonies of Goa, Daman and Diu, which would govern itself as a separate national entity, but within the Portuguese Commonwealth. This put him at further odds with the ruling Estado Novo regime, which considered their Indian colonies to be an integral part of Portugal and dismissed any ideas of independence. Last years After retiring to Goa, Mello was not put up as candidate for re-election through a political manoeuvre of the Salazar's single party regime. In 1950, when the Fifth International Congress of Microbiology was to take place in Petropolis, Brazil, Mello who had expected to be nominated as the delegate of Portugal, found out to his surprise that Salazar had instead appointed another delegation without him. When this came to be known, the Brazilian Government invited him, providing for his travel and stay. Finding himself under increased political persecution by Salazar's government in Goa, Mello emigrated with his wife to Brazil in 1951, where three of their children were already settled. He settled down in S√£o Paulo, where he continued his research in the field of Protozoa, in the intestines of termites. He discovered various new species there which he dedicated to his new country. He gave lectures and conferences in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo and was invited to organise the section of protozoology at the Instituto Ezequiel Dias in Belo Horizonte. Mello died in S√£o Paulo of lung cancer on 9 January 1955, aged 67. His last scientific paper, Memorias do Instituto Ezequiel Dias (Memoirs of the Ezequiel Dias Institute) was published in February 1955, a month after his death. Personal life Mello was married twice. His first wife was Marie Eugenie Caillat, an aristocratic Swiss from Geneva, who after marriage moved with him to Panjim. Eugenie was the first person to translate the works of Rabindranath Tagore into French. She died in 1921 from complications brought on by the Spanish flu virus in Porto. The couple did not have any children. On 15 September 1923, Mello married his second wife Hedwig Bachmann, a young Swiss school teacher from Diessenhofen. They had six children: Alfredo, EugeŒÆia, Victor, Francisco Paulo, Cristina and Margarida. Hedwig authored a book entitled Von der Seele der Indischen Frau (Tipografia Rangel, Goa, 1941) published also in translation, On the soul of the Indian women. The book is a psycho-sociological study of Hindu traditions as interpreted from proverbs and the impact of Aryan and Dravidian civilisations. One of his sons, Alfredo Bachmann de Mello (1924‚Äì2010) was a well-known travel writer and memoirist who authored an auto-biography, From Goa to Patagonia: memoirs spanning times and spaces. Another son, Victor Froilano Bachmann de Mello (1927‚Äì2009) was a world-renowned geotechnical engineer.

The whole council, a unitary authority, was up for election with 54 councillors elected from 21 wards. The Green Party made significant gains, overtaking the Conservatives to become the largest party with 23 seats, the largest Green group on any council. The Greens gained seats at the expense of all three other parties, taking the only ward previously in Liberal Democrat hands. The Conservatives lost not only to the Greens but to Labour Co-op candidates in different parts of the city. The Greens, Conservatives and Labour Co-op fielded candidates for every seat on the council. The Liberal Democrats contested all but one ward. The UK Independence Party, European Citizens Party and Trade Unionists and Socialists Against Cuts also fielded candidates. In addition, there were six independents standing, including re-standing councillor and former Liberal Democrat David Watkins. Following the election the Labour Co-operative group rejected the possibility of forming a coalition with the Green Party, who then went on to form the first ever Green council administration in the UK, as a minority administration. As of 2018, it is the most recent local authority election in which the Green Party of England and Wales won the most votes and seats. Following the election, the composition of the council was as follows: Green: 23 Conservative: 18 Labour: 13 Changes between 2007 and 2011 elections Since the 2007 Council Election there were a number of changes to the make up of the council: In the Regency, Goldsmid and St. Peter's & North Laine wards there were by-elections, all of which were won or held by the Green Party. In Brunswick and Adelaide one councillor, David Watkins resigned from the Liberal Democrats and stood as an independent in this election. Jayne Bennett, who was elected as an Independent in the 2007 election in the Stanford/Hove Park ward, rejoined the Conservative Party (which she had left in 2002), and stood as such in 2011. Two ward names were changed during the four-year period: Hollingbury and Stanmer became Hollingdean and Stanmer, and Stanford ward was renamed Hove Park, using the council's powers under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.

A strip can be thought of as the collection of complex numbers whose real part lie in a given subset of the real line and whose imaginary part is unconstrained; likewise, a tube is the set of complex vectors whose real part is in some given collection of real vectors, and whose imaginary part is unconstrained. Tube domains are domains of the Laplace transform of a function of several real variables (see multidimensional Laplace transform). Hardy spaces on tubes can be defined in a manner in which a version of the Paley‚ÄìWiener theorem from one variable continues to hold, and characterizes the elements of Hardy spaces as the Laplace transforms of functions with appropriate integrability properties. Tubes over convex sets are domains of holomorphy. The Hardy spaces on tubes over convex cones have an especially rich structure, so that precise results are known concerning the boundary values of Hp functions. In mathematical physics, the future tube is the tube domain associated to the interior of the past null cone in Minkowski space, and has applications in relativity theory and quantum gravity. Certain tubes over cones support a Bergman metric in terms of which they become bounded symmetric domains. One of these is the Siegel half-space which is fundamental in arithmetic. Definition Let Rn denote real coordinate space of dimension n and Cn denote complex coordinate space. Then any element of Cn can be decomposed into real and imaginary parts: :a=(z_1,dots,z_n) = (x_1+iy_1, dots, x_n+iy_n) = (x_1,dots,x_n) + i(y_1,dots,y_n)=x+iy. Let A be an open subset of Rn. The tube over A, denoted TA, is the subset of Cn consisting of all elements whose real parts lie in A: :T_A = { z=x+iyinmathbb{C}^nmid xin A}. Tubes as domains of holomorphy Suppose that A is a connected open set. Then any complex-valued function that is holomorphic in a tube TA can be extended uniquely to a holomorphic function on the convex hull of the tube , which is also a tube, and in fact :operatorname{ch} , T_A = T_{operatorname{ch}, A}. Since any convex open set is a domain of holomorphy, a convex tube is also a domain of holomorphy. So the holomorphic envelope of any tube is equal to its convex hull. Hardy spaces Let A be an open set in Rn. The Hardy space H p(TA) is the set of all holomorphic functions F in TA such that :int_{mathbb{R}^n} F(x+iy)^p, dy < infty for all x in A. In the special case of p = 2, functions in H2(TA) can be characterized as follows. Let ∆í be a complex-valued function on Rn satisfying :sup_{xin A}int_{mathbb{R}^n}f(t)^2e^{-4pi xcdot t},dt < infty. The Fourier‚ÄìLaplace transform of ∆í is defined by :F(x+iy) = int_{mathbb{R}^n}e^{2pi zcdot t}f(t),dt. Then F is well-defined and belongs to H2(TA). Conversely, every element of H2(TA) has this form. A corollary of this characterization is that H2(TA) contains a nonzero function if and only if A contains no straight line. =Tubes over cones= Let A be an open convex cone in Rn. This means that A is an open convex set such that, whenever x lies in A, so does the entire ray from the origin to x. Symbolically, :xin A implies txin A   text{for all} t>0. If A is a cone, then the elements of H2(TA) have L2 boundary limits in the sense that :lim_{yto 0} F(x+iy) exists in L2(B). There is an analogous result for Hp(TA), but it requires additional regularity of the cone (specifically, the dual cone A* needs to have nonempty interior).

It was founded in 1989 and named after Chiang Ching-kuo, leader of the Republic of China from 1972 to 1988. The foundation also has a regional office in McLean, Virginia in the United States. History The Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange was founded in 1989 by officials of the Kuomintang, the ruling party of the Republic of China. The stated motivation for the foundation stems from professors of Chinese descent at American universities becoming concerned about the decline of programs of Chinese studies at colleges and universities overseas, and their desire to reverse this situation. Chiang Ching-kuo is said to have favored creation of the foundation, and it was created as a living memorial to him. The foundation was patterned after the Fulbright Program in the United States. The foundation's original endowment was US$86 million, consisting of $53 million from the Republic of China Ministry of Education and $33 million from private donors. The foundation then operates using the interest generated from this endowment, which as of 2004 was $3.4 million for a year. The foundation is governed by a board, consisting of prominent government officials, academics, people in industry, and assorted other citizens. As of 2011, the board had 19 members; its chair was Mao Kao-wen, and notable members included former Taiwan Province governor James Soong, Morris Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, former Chinese University of Hong Kong Vice-Chancellor Lawrence Lau, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs Fredrick Chien. The Ministry of Education continues to have a strong voice in foundation decisions. The foundation's principal goals are to foster the overseas study of Chinese culture and society, to support international scholarly exchange, to promote widespread attention to and understanding of Taiwan, and to promote academic dialogue on global issues. The foundation organizes its grants by four geographical areas: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and domestic (Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao); historically, most of its activity has been with those in the United States. In its first seven years of operation, the foundation spent $23 million on American scholarship. By 2001, many Western academics who were specialists in China were getting research funds from the foundation. By 2004, the foundation had supported nearly 2,000 projects overall. The Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation provides research grants, fellowship grants, grants for conferences, seminars, and workshops, publication subsidies, doctoral fellowships (including for Taiwanese students abroad), and travel grants and visiting fellowships. In some cases, research that focuses on Taiwan's recent social, cultural, economic, or political development is encouraged, as are collaborative projects with scholars in Taiwan. Grants from the foundation have sometimes proven controversial. In 1996, the University of California, Berkeley was offered $3 million for a new center to study ancient Chinese cultures, but the offer was dependent upon the university commemorating both the foundation and Chiang Ching-kuo. This brought about opposition to the proposed funding by students and scholars who objected to the history of political repression during the earlier years of Chiang's regime. They thought it would damage Berkeley's reputation and put Berkeley under undue control by the foundation, and who feared it would harm the university's research and exchange student dealings with the People's Republic of China. The director of the US office of the foundation said in response that political aspects are not a factor in the foundation's funding decisions. The university decided to name the program, but not the center, after Chiang and the foundation, causing the foundation to suspend the offer. In the end, two centers for Sinological research were set up: The Chiang Ching-kuo International Sinological Center at Charles University (CCK-ISC) was established in 1997 at Charles University in Prague, and the Chiang Ching-kuo Center for Chinese Cultural and Institutional History was established in 1999 in conjunction with the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures at Columbia University in New York. Political complexities have also extended to scholars working in the People's Republic, who have worried that getting research funds from the foundation or other sources in Taiwan would lead to them being suspected as spying for or otherwise colluding with Taiwan.

Vance, and Jeremy Jordan. It was written and directed by Todd Graff, with gospel-infused music by Mervyn Warren. The film was released in U.S. theaters on January 13, 2012. In the film, two strong-minded women are forced to cooperate when budget cuts threaten to shut down a small-town choir. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for its songs and acting but criticism of its script and tone. Plot After the untimely death of a small-town church choir director (Kris Kristofferson) in Pacashau, Georgia, Vi Rose Hill (Queen Latifah), a practical mother raising two teenagers alone, takes control of the choir using the traditional Gospel style that their Pastor Dale (Courtney B. Vance) approves of. However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow (Dolly Parton), the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur \\"Joyful Noise\\" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at a time when the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever. Vi Rose has a son, Walter (Dexter Darden), who has Asperger syndrome, and a talented, beautiful and independent daughter, Olivia (Keke Palmer), who detests being under her mother's household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy (Jeremy Jordan). A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny (Paul Woolfolk). At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals. But the pastor says that the church will not sponsor the choir unless they continue to use their reverent, traditional style. Vi Rose's husband, Marcus (Jesse L. Martin), enlisted in the army after having trouble finding work at home, but his prolonged absence has saddened his family and causes additional tension between Vi Rose and Olivia. Meanwhile, a vivacious member of the choir who choreographs their routines, Earla (Angela Grovey), after a long dry stretch, finds passion first with Mr. Hsu (Francis Jue), whose weak heart gives way by morning, and later with Justin (Roy Huang). The town's tough times forces another choir member, Caleb (Andy Karl), and his family out of business. Vi Rose and G. G. come to blows in a confrontation, Olivia's frustration with her mother boils over, and G. G. threatens Pastor Dale with disendowing the church if the choir is not allowed to compete in the finals with the new arrangements. During the movie Randy befriends Walter and begins to teach him how to play the piano. One day, while at the quarry Randy and Walter are hanging out as Manny arrives. Randy and Manny begin to fight over Olivia ending with Randy giving Manny a bloody nose. When returning home Walter brags to Vi Rose about the fight. Angered by the news, she throws out Randy and tells him to leave her family alone. Randy, however, is able to befriend Manny and convince him to help out the choir with his guitar skills. The choir travels to Los Angeles for the finals, feeling very unsettled. Vi Rose and Olivia have a fight and Vi Rose slaps Olivia. Tough competition presents itself in the form of a choir made up of cute pre-teens, with a charismatic young soloist (Ivan Kelley Jr.). But Vi Rose, G. G., Olivia and Randy pull the choir together and they give a rousing performance, using the new arrangements and choreography, capturing first place. The choir returns to town in triumph. One year later Earla and Justin get married and then Marcus comes back to his family. Cast * Queen Latifah as Vi Rose Hill * Dolly Parton as G. G.

Early life and education Hamisi Andrea Kigwangalla was born on 7 August 1975. His father was a banker with the National Bank of Commerce. His mother, Bagaile Bakari Lumola (a retired CCM employee), was a primary school teacher in Nzega Ndogo Primary School, in Nzega town, where his father was posted to open a new branch of the bank. Kigwangalla's father, Nasser Mahampa Kigwangalla, descends from a well-known Kimbu clan from Goweko ‚Äì Igalula, and his mother was the daughter of a Nyamwezi Chief, Lumola Bakari Maulid (a key figure in Hamisi A. Kigwangalla‚Äôs upbringing following the divorce of his parents at a young age). His maternal grandfather attended Tabora School a few years ahead of Julius Nyerere. He was educated at Kigoma and Shinyanga secondary schools before joining the University of Dar es Salaam where he pursued a medicine degree from 1999 to its completion in 2004. He then pursued postgraduate studies in Sweden at the Blekinge Institute of Technology (M.B.A.) and Karolinska Institutet (M.P.H.). He is currently finalizing a (Ph.D.) thesis in Public Health (Health Systems and Health Economics) at the University of Cape Town (South Africa). Career Addressing a rally at his constituency He is a young Member of Parliament sitting in the National Assembly (Tanzania) representing Nzega constituency of the Tabora region. He was first elected in the national elections on October 31, 2010. His appointment by the national executive council to run for the post through the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) ticket was followed by a lot of criticism with critics claiming that he was appointed to contest for the post despite being the second runner up after Hussein Mohammed Bashe (the winner of the primary votes), who was not favoured on account of his citizenship being unclear, and the incumbent Lucas Lumambo Selelii (1st runner up) in the primaries, because he was working for the First Lady of Tanzania's charitable organisation, Wanawake na Maendeleo (WAMA), a rumour which he denies. Immediately after his nomination by the CCM's top congregation, he was also arrested by the immigration police on charges of being a non-citizen of Tanzania and this became a center issue in the Tanzanian media. He was however cleared two days later. Despite the fact that he was cleared by the immigration officials, he still had to face stern objections from the opposition contestants. Despite criticism and allegations, Kigwangalla won the elections. He was featured in daily newspapers in Tanzania saying that he intends to table a motion in the National Assembly claiming that the Golden Pride Gold Mine, a gold mining project located in Nzega and owned by an Australian mining giant subsidiary company, Resolute Tanzania Ltd, is useless and has no benefits to people from Nzega and the country at large and that it should be closed. Dr. Kigwangalla was re-elected to the Parliament in the recently concluded (October 2015) Tanzanian general elections to represent the Nzega Rural Constituency on a CCM ticket.

It existed from 1938 to 1945. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany.

At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War. Local Gauleiters were in charge of propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onwards, the Volkssturm and the defence of the Gau.

Oldenburgs keel was laid in October 1908 at the Schichau-Werke dockyard in Danzig. She was launched on 30 September 1909 and was commissioned into the fleet on 1 May 1912. The ship was equipped with twelve guns in six twin turrets, and had a top speed of . Oldenburg was assigned to I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career, including World War I. Along with her three sister ships, , , and , Oldenburg participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I in the North Sea against the British Grand Fleet, including the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916, the largest naval battle of the war. The ship also saw action in the Baltic Sea against the Imperial Russian Navy. She was present during the unsuccessful first incursion into the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, though she saw no combat during the operation. After the German collapse in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet was interned and then scuttled in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany but eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Oldenburg was given to Japan, which sold the vessel to a British ship-breaking firm in 1920. She was broken up for scrap in Dordrecht in 1921.  Design  Line drawing of the Helgoland class The ship was long, had a beam of and a draft of , and displaced at full load. She was powered by three vertical triple expansion steam engines and fifteen water- tube boilers. The engines were rated at and were capable of producing a top speed of . Oldenburg stored up to of coal, allowing her to steam for at a speed of . After 1915 the boilers were modified to burn oil, which would be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate; the ship could carry up to . Oldenburg had a crew of 42 officers and 1,027 enlisted men. Oldenburg was armed with a main battery of twelve SK L/50 guns in six twin gun turrets, with one turret fore, one aft, and two on each flank of the ship. The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen SK L/45 guns and fourteen SK L/45 guns. After 1914, two of the 8.8 cm guns were removed and replaced by 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns; later, an additional two 8.8 cm guns were replaced with anti-aircraft guns. This brought the total number of 8.8 cm SK L/45 guns to ten, and the number of 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns to four. Oldenburg was also armed with six submerged torpedo tubes; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and two on each broadside. Her main armored belt was thick in the central portion, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by the same thickness of KCA on the sides and faces, as well as the barbettes that supported the turrets. Oldenburgs deck was thick.  Service history  Kaiser alt=Men in military uniforms walk down stairs on a large warship as dozens of sailors look on and salute. Oldenburg was ordered by the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) under the provisional name Ersatz Frithjof, as a replacement for the old coastal defense ship . The contract for the ship was awarded to the Schichau-Werke shipyard in Danzig under construction number 828. Her three sisters had been ordered for 1908, but because of budget constraints, Oldenburg order was delayed to 1909. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Navy, gave the contract to Schichau before the 1909 budget had been approved, and the shipbuilder began stockpiling materials to build the ship. This gave the impression that Germany was building more battleships than publicly admitted, which prompted a naval scare in Britain. The British public demanded \\"we want eight [new battleships] and we won't wait\\", and in the span of a year eight new battleships had been laid down in Britain, a major escalation in the international naval arms race. Work began on 1 March 1909 with the laying of her keel, and the ship was launched a little more than a year later on 30 June 1910. Duchess Sophia Charlotte of Oldenburg christened her, and Friedrich August, the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, gave the speech. After launching, the incomplete ship was transferred to Kiel for fitting-out, including completion of the superstructure and the installation of armament, until August 1911. Named for the Duchy of Oldenburg in northern Germany, the ship was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 May 1912, just over three years after work commenced. After her commissioning on 1 May 1912, Oldenburg conducted sea trials in the Baltic. On 17 July, she was assigned to I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, alongside her sisters. After individual ship training exercises, she joined I Squadron maneuvers and then fleet maneuvers in November. The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic, in order to keep the fleet closer to Germany. Oldenburg and the rest of the fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years of peace-time training. The annual summer cruise to Norway began on 14 July 1914, despite the rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills in the Skagerrak before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany due to Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On 27 July, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skudenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out on the 28th, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict. By 29 July Oldenburg and the rest of I Squadron were back in Wilhelmshaven. = World War I = The High Seas Fleet's disposition on the morning of 16 December 1914, during the alt=Map showing the locations of the British and German fleets; the German light cruisers pass between the British battleship and battlecruiser forces while the German battlecruisers steam to the northeast. The German battleships lie to the east of the other ships. Oldenburg was present during the first sortie by German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral Ingenohl intended to use the battlecruisers of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group to raid British coastal towns in order to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. That evening, the German battle fleet of eight pre-dreadnoughts and twelve dreadnoughts, including Oldenburg and her three sisters, came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet, so Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany, under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily. The Battle of Dogger Bank, in which Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons ambushed the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, occurred on 24 January 1915. Oldenburg and the rest of I Squadron were sortied to reinforce the outnumbered German battlecruisers; I Squadron left port at 12:33 CET, along with the pre-dreadnoughts of II Squadron. They were too late, however, and they failed to locate any British forces. By 19:05, the fleet had returned to the Schillig Roads outside Wilhelmshaven. In the meantime, the armored cruiser had been overwhelmed by concentrated British fire and sunk, while the battlecruiser was severely damaged by an ammunition fire. As a result, Kaiser Wilhelm II removed Ingenohl from his post and replaced him with Admiral Hugo von Pohl on 2 February. From 22 February to 13 March 1915, I Squadron was in the Baltic for unit training. Following their return to the North Sea, the ships participated in a series of uneventful fleet sorties on 29‚Äì30 March, 17‚Äì18 April, 21‚Äì22 April, 17‚Äì18 May, and 29‚Äì30 May. The fleet was largely inactive until 4 August, when I Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of training maneuvers. From there, the squadron was attached to the naval force that attempted to sweep the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces in August 1915. The assault force included the eight I Squadron battleships, the battlecruisers , , and Seydlitz, several light cruisers, 32 destroyers and 13 minesweepers. The plan called for channels in Russian minefields to be swept so that the Russian naval presence, which included the pre-dreadnought battleship , could be eliminated. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent Russian ships from returning to the Gulf. Oldenburg and the majority of the other big ships of the High Seas Fleet remained outside the Gulf for the entirety of the operation, to prevent possible intervention by the Russian fleet outside the Gulf. The dreadnoughts and were detached on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to destroy Slava, though they failed to sink the old battleship. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August, but reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the Gulf the following day. By 26 August, I Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven. On 23‚Äì24 October, the High Seas Fleet undertook its last major offensive operation under the command of Admiral Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. Weakened by hepatic cancer and unable to carry out his duties, he was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5‚Äì7 March, followed by two more on 21‚Äì22 March and 25‚Äì26 March. During his next operation, Oldenburg supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser Seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of I Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.  Battle of Jutland  alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Oldenburg was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Oldenburg was the fourth ship in I Division of I Squadron and the twelfth ship in the line, directly astern of her sister ship Helgoland and ahead of Posen. At the center of the German line was I Squadron, behind the eight - and s of III Squadron. The six elderly pre-dreadnoughts of III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, K√∂nig, spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given. At first, Oldenburg was too far away to effectively engage any British ships. Shortly before 18:30, the German line came across the British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement. Naval historian John Campbell states that \\"Th√ºringen and Helgoland, and possibly Oldenburg and Posen, fired turret guns\\", as well as secondary weapons, at Nestor. The ship was destroyed by several large explosions and sank at 18:35; most of her crew was rescued by German torpedo boats. Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought came into range; she was the first major warship Oldenburg could engage. She fired her 30.5 cm guns briefly during the 180-degree turn ordered by Scheer to disengage from the British fleet. Oldenburg claimed to have straddled Warspite once, though her gunners had difficulty discerning the British battleship in the growing haze. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Oldenburg was now the fifth ship, stationed toward the front of the 24-ship line. At around 01:10, the German line encountered the six destroyers of the British 4th Destroyer Flotilla. Oldenburg fired on several of the destroyers at close range, including and . Fortune scored a single hit on Oldenburg with her 4-inch guns. The shell struck a forward searchlight above the bridge and caused serious casualties. The officer responsible for directing the 8.8 cm guns was killed, along with three other officers on the bridge. The helmsman was incapacitated and the ship's commander, Captain H√∂pfner, was wounded. Oldenburg was briefly steaming unsteered, and was in danger of ramming Posen and Helgoland until Captain H√∂pfner managed to reach the wheel and take control of the ship. Oldenburg and several other battleships then took under fire; the destroyer was reduced to a flaming wreck. In the darkness, Fortune and Ardent were sunk and the remaining four ships were scattered. Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4:00 on 1 June. A few hours later, the fleet arrived in the Jade; Th√ºringen, Helgoland, Nassau, and took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead and , , , and anchored just outside the entrance locks to Wilhelmshaven. Oldenburg and the other seven remaining dreadnoughts entered port, where those that were still in fighting condition restocked ammunition and fuel. In the course of the battle, Oldenburg fired fifty-three 30.5 cm, eighty-eight 15 cm, and thirty 8.8 cm shells. The hit from Fortune was the only damage the ship incurred from enemy action, though a misfire occurred in the Number 4 port-side 15 cm gun. In total, Oldenburgs crew suffered eight men killed and fourteen wounded.  Subsequent operations  After Jutland, Oldenburg was assigned to guard duties in the German Bight. The damage incurred at Jutland was quickly repaired in Wilhelmshaven from 30 June to 15 July. On 18 August, Admiral Scheer attempted a repeat of the 31 May operation. Moltke and Von der Tann, the two serviceable German battlecruisers, were supported by three dreadnoughts in a mission to bombard the coastal town of Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Oldenburg, would trail behind and provide cover. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north and aborted the bombardment after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. On 25‚Äì26 September, Oldenburg and the rest of I Squadron covered an advance conducted by the II F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote (Leader of Torpedo Boats) to the Terschelling Bank. Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18‚Äì20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank, though again they failed to find British forces. For the majority of 1917, Oldenburg was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During Operation Albion, the amphibious assault on the Russian- held islands in the Gulf of Riga, Oldenburg and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on 29 October. On 2 November the operation was completed and Oldenburg and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23‚Äì24 April 1918. Scheer had intended to intercept a British convoy to Norway and destroy the escorting battleships. During the operation, the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical problems and had to be towed back to port. Oldenburg took the ship in tow, and the main body of the fleet turned back to Germany while Hipper searched in vain for the convoy. German intelligence had incorrectly placed the date for the scheduled convoy on 24 April, and after several hours of fruitless steaming, Hipper turned for port as well. By 18:37, the fleet was outside the Jade and Moltke had been repaired enough to allow her to enter port under her own power. = Fate = Oldenburg and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet. Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on Th√ºringen and then on several other battleships mutinied. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy\\". Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the most modern capital ships of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow, but Oldenburg, commanded by Hermann Bauer, and the rest of I Squadron remained in Germany. On the morning of 21 June 1919, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and in their absence Reuter ordered the crews to scuttle the ten battleships and five battlecruisers interned at Scapa Flow. Oldenburg was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919 and placed out of commission. The fate of the eight remaining German battleships was determined in the Treaty of Versailles, which stated that the ships were to be disarmed and surrendered to the governments of the principal Allied powers. She was surrendered to Japan as \\"M\\" on 13 May 1920. The Japanese Navy had no need for the ship; she was sold to a British ship-breaking firm in June 1920 and broken up for scrap the following year in Dordrecht.

Some commentators have found his discussion of Freud valuable, while others have questioned his conclusions. Summary J√ºrgen Habermas Habermas discusses the history of positivism, aiming to provide an analysis of \\"the connections between knowledge and human interests.\\" He relates his ideas to the those of the philosopher Karl Marx, explaining that he develops an idea \\"implicit in Marx's theory of society\\". He states that psychoanalysis occupies an important place as an example within his framework. He argues that modern philosophical discussion has been focused on the question of deciding how reliable knowledge is possible, the field of epistemology. In his view, rationalism and empiricism were both concerned with \\"the metaphysical demarcation of the realm of objects and the logical and psychological justification of the validity of a natural science characterized by formalized language and experiment.\\" According to Habermas, while physics was sometimes the model for \\"clear and distinct knowledge\\" in the 19th century, philosophy and science remained distinct, as did epistemology and philosophy of science. He argues that since the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's critique of the work of the philosopher Immanuel Kant, science and philosophy have become disconnected, with the result that science is no longer \\"seriously comprehended by philosophy\\", making it necessary to reexamine the nature of science and scientific knowledge and the role of the philosophy of science. Other philosophers Habermas discusses include Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Auguste Comte, Ernst Mach, Charles Sanders Peirce, Wilhelm Dilthey, and Edmund Husserl; in the course of discussing Dilthey, he examines hermeneutics. In his discussion of the work of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, Habermas argues that psychoanalysis is the \\"only tangible example of a science incorporating methodical self-reflection\\", but that while it had the potential to exceed the limits of positivism, this has remained unrealized because of its \\"scientific self-misunderstanding\\", for which Freud was responsible. He also provides a critique of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, arguing that Nietzsche tacitly accepted some \\"basic positivist assumptions\\". Background and publication history According to Habermas, he first expounded the views he developed in the book in his Frankfurt inaugural address of June 1965, while his discussion of positivism, pragmatism and historicism had its origins in lectures he delivered in Heidelberg in 1963 and 1964. He expressed his indebtedness to the philosopher Karl-Otto Apel and the psychoanalysts Alexander Mitscherlich and Alfred Lorenzer. Knowledge and Human Interests was first published by Suhrkamp Velag in 1968, with the exception of its appendix, which was first published in Merkur in 1965. In 1972, an English translation by the philosopher Jeremy J. Shapiro was published by Heinemann Educational Books. In 1987, an English edition was published by Polity Press in association with Blackwell Publishers. Reception Knowledge and Human Interests received positive reviews from Fred E. Jandt in the Journal of Applied Communication Research, Thomas B. Farrell in the Quarterly Journal of Speech, and the sociologist Anthony Giddens in the American Journal of Sociology, a mixed review from the sociologist Steven Lukes in the British Journal of Sociology, and a negative review from the sociologist David Martin in the Jewish Journal of Sociology. Jandt found the book promising, though he considered it difficult to assess because of Habermas's competence in fields ranging from the logic of science to the sociology of knowledge. Farrell found the book ambitious in its goals and dispassionate in its approach. He believed that it formed part of a body of work which \\"comprises a dialectic sufficiently rigorous to indict and perhaps dislodge behavioral and scientistic theories of communication.\\" Giddens described the book as one of Habermas's \\"major writings\\", adding that it was comparable to works such as Legitimation Crisis (1973) and \\"culminates the first phase of Habermas's career and remains perhaps the most hotly debated of his works.\\" He credited Habermas with developing and clarifying his arguments that the social sciences require connecting hermeneutics with empiricist philosophies of science. Lukes found the book disappointing. He wrote that, \\"Its style is unnecessarily obscure and high-flown, its lack of fine-grained philosophical analysis disappointing, and its concentration on the exegesis of other thinkers essentially diversionary.\\" He maintained that while Habermas had interesting things to say about several thinkers, especially Freud, most of the exegesis was \\"familiar\\", while some of it was \\"perverse\\", such as Habermas's \\"juxtaposition of Comte and Mach under the label of 'positivism'.\\" He credited Habermas with providing a systematic account of his view of his \\"philosophical ancestors\\", which he considered valuable since Habermas was an important representative of the Frankfurt School, but believed Habermas failed to provide a satisfactory discussion of critical science or a direct discussion of the connection between knowledge and human interests. Martin argued that the work reflected the \\"impasse of the sociology of knowledge\\" and failed to explain how transforming social relations would make objectivity possible. Knowledge and Human Interests was discussed by Paul Ric≈ìur in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, Rainer Nagele, Roland Reinhart, and Roger Blood in New German Critique, Kenneth Colburn Jr. in Sociological Inquiry, Steven Vogel in Praxis International, Richard Tinning in Quest, Jennifer Scuro in The Oral History Review, and Myriam N. Torres and Silvia E. Moraes in the International Journal of Action Research. In Philosophy of the Social Sciences, it was discussed by Stephen D. Parsons and Michael Power. Ric≈ìur endorsed Habermas's view that psychoanalysis misunderstood itself by claiming to be a natural science. Colburn questioned whether Habermas's attempt to demonstrate the connection between knowledge and interest helped him to critique positivism. He argued against Habermas that interest is not independent of knowledge. He criticized Habermas's definition of knowledge. Torres and Moraes described Knowledge and Human Interests as a \\"seminal work\\", and credited Habermas with providing \\"the theoretical framework for understanding curriculum and educational research.\\" The philosopher Walter Kaufmann criticized Habermas for poor scholarship in his treatment of Nietzsche. He noted that Habermas relied on the inadequate edition of Nietzsche's works prepared by Karl Schlechta. The philosopher Leszek Ko≈Çakowski identified Knowledge and Human Interests as one of Habermas's principal books. However, he questioned the accuracy of Habermas's understanding of both psychoanalysis and Marx's work, and criticized Habermas for failing to clearly define the concept of \\"emancipation\\". The philosopher Adolf Gr√ºnbaum noted that Habermas's conclusions had influenced both philosophers and psychoanalysts. However, he criticized Habermas's discussion of the scientific status of psychoanalysis. He described Habermas's arguments as inconsistent and his conclusions about the therapeutic effects of psychoanalytic treatment as incoherent as well as incompatible with Freud's hypotheses. He also argued that Habermas had a limited understanding of science and put forward a mistaken contrast between the human sciences and sciences such as physics. He rejected Habermas's view that it is the acceptance of psychoanalytic interpretations by patients in analytic treatment that establishes their validity and accused Habermas of quoting Freud out of context to help him make his case. The philosopher Douglas Kellner credited Habermas with demonstrating the importance of psychoanalysis for \\"increasing understanding of human nature and contributing to the process of self- formation\\". He suggested that Habermas made better use of several Freudian ideas in Knowledge and Human Interests than did Marcuse in Eros and Civilization. The philosopher Jeffrey Abramson compared Knowledge and Human Interests to Herbert Marcuse's Eros and Civilization (1955), Norman O. Brown's Life Against Death (1959), Philip Rieff's Freud: The Mind of the Moralist (1959) and Paul Ric≈ìur's Freud and Philosophy (1965). He wrote that these books jointly placed Freud at the center of moral and philosophical inquiry. The philosopher Tom Rockmore described Knowledge and Human Interests as a \\"complex study\\". He suggested that it may eventually be recognized as Habermas's most significant work. He found Habermas's discussion of Freud valuable, but argued that by attributing a view of knowledge and interest similar to his to Freud, he \\"cloaks his own theory in the prestige of Freud's.\\" The philosopher Jonathan Lear blamed Knowledge and Human Interests, along with Ric≈ìur's Freud and Philosophy, for convincing some psychoanalysts that reasons cannot be causes. He credited Gr√ºnbaum with effectively criticizing Habermas. The historian Paul Robinson described Habermas's thinking about the nature of analytic cures as obscure. The critic Frederick Crews criticized Habermas for helping to inspire unscientific defenses of Freud and psychoanalysis. He also charged him with misunderstanding Freud. He endorsed Gr√ºnbaum's criticism of Habermas. The philosopher Alan Ryan argued that Knowledge and Human Interests represented Habermas's \\"most radical thoughts about the connection between philosophical speculation and social emancipation\\". However, he maintained that the implications of its ideas for the social sciences were unclear, and that Habermas failed to develop them in his later work. He observed that readers who had initially been impressed by Habermas had been disappointed by this. The sociologist William Outhwaite described Knowledge and Human Interests as \\"enormously ambitious and challenging\\". However, he noted that, following its publication, Habermas's interests shifted away from its focus on epistemological questions and toward \\"language and communicative action.\\" The philosopher Jon Barwise identified Knowledge and Human Interests as Habermas's first major systematic work.

Th√ºringens keel was laid in November 1908 at the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen. She was launched on 27 November 1909 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 July 1911. The ship was equipped with twelve guns in six twin turrets, and had a top speed of . Th√ºringen was assigned to I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet for the majority of her career, including World War I. Along with her three sister ships, , , and , Th√ºringen participated in all of the major fleet operations of World War I in the North Sea against the British Grand Fleet. This included the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916, the largest naval battle of the war. Th√ºringen was involved in the heavy night fighting at Jutland, including the destruction of the armored cruiser . The ship also saw action against the Imperial Russian Navy in the Baltic Sea, where she participated in the unsuccessful first incursion into the Gulf of Riga in August 1915. After the German collapse in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow during the peace negotiations. The four Helgoland-class ships were allowed to remain in Germany and were therefore spared the destruction of the fleet in Scapa Flow. Th√ºringen and her sisters were eventually ceded to the victorious Allied powers as war reparations; Th√ºringen was transferred to France in April 1920 and used as a target ship for the French Navy. She was sunk off Gavres and broken up in situ in 1923‚Äì1933, though some sections of the ship remain.  Design  Line drawing of the Helgoland class The ship was long overall, had a beam of and a draft of , and displaced at full load. She was powered by three vertical triple expansion steam engines and fifteen water-tube boilers. The engines were rated at and were capable of producing a top speed of . Th√ºringen stored up to of coal, which allowed her to steam for at a speed of . After 1915, the boilers were modified to spray oil on the coal to increase its burn rate; the ship could carry up to of fuel oil. She had a crew of 42 officers and 1,071 enlisted men. Th√ºringen was armed with a main battery of twelve SK L/50 guns in six twin gun turrets, with one turret fore, one aft, and two on each flank of the ship. The ship's secondary armament consisted of fourteen SK L/45 guns and fourteen SK L/45 guns. After 1914, two of the 8.8 cm guns were removed and replaced by 8.8 cm anti-aircraft guns. Th√ºringen was also armed with six submerged torpedo tubes; one was in the bow, one in the stern, and two on each broadside. Her main armored belt was thick in the central portion, and was composed of Krupp cemented armor (KCA). Her main battery gun turrets were protected by the same thickness of KCA on the sides and faces, as well as the barbettes that supported the turrets. Th√ºringens deck was thick.  Service history  Th√ºringen was ordered by the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) under the provisional name Ersatz Beowulf, as a replacement for the old coastal defense ship . The contract for the ship was awarded to the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen under construction number 166. Work began on 2 November 1908 with the laying of her keel, and the ship was launched a year later on 27 November 1909. She was christened by Duchess Adelheid von Sachsen-Altenburg, and Grand Duke Wilhelm Ernst gave the speech. Fitting-out, including completion of the superstructure and the installation of armament, lasted until June 1911. Following her completion, six pontoon barges were attached to the new battleship to reduce her draft to allow her to be towed down the Weser River to the North Sea. Th√ºringen, named for Thuringia, a state in central Germany, was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 1 June 1911, less than three years after work commenced. After her commissioning on 1 July 1911, Th√ºringen conducted sea trials, which were completed by 10 September. On 19 September, she was assigned to I Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, alongside her sisters. She then went on to conduct individual ship training exercises, which were followed by I Squadron exercises and then fleet maneuvers in November. The annual summer cruise in July and August, which typically went to Norway, was interrupted by the Agadir Crisis. As a result, the cruise only went into the Baltic. Th√ºringen and the rest of the fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years. In October 1913, William Michaelis became the ship's commanding officer; he held the post until February 1915. On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On 27 July, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skudenes before returning to port, where they remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and within a week all the major European powers had joined the conflict. By 29 July Th√ºringen and the rest of I Squadron were back in Wilhelmshaven. During the first year of the war, the future anti-Nazi Lutheran pastor Martin Niem√∂ller served aboard the ship as an officer. = World War I = The High Seas Fleet's disposition on the morning of 16 December 1914, during the alt=Map showing the locations of the British and German fleets; the German light cruisers pass between the British battleship and battlecruiser forces while the German battlecruisers steam to the northeast. The German battleships lie to the east of the other ships. Th√ºringen was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea, which took place on 2‚Äì3 November 1914. No British forces were encountered during the operation. A second operation followed on 15‚Äì16 December. This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet. Admiral von Ingenohl intended to use the battlecruisers of Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet. Early on 15 December the fleet left port to raid the towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on the English coast. That evening, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts‚Äîincluding Th√ºringen and her three sisters‚Äîand eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. Skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from Kaiser Wilhelm II to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the battle fleet back toward Germany. The Battle of Dogger Bank, in which Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons ambushed the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, occurred on 24 January 1915. Th√ºringen and the rest of I Squadron were sortied to reinforce the outnumbered German battlecruisers; I Squadron left port at 12:33 CET, along with the pre- dreadnoughts of II Squadron. The High Seas Fleet was too late, so it failed to locate any British forces. By 19:05, the fleet had returned to the Schillig Roads outside Wilhelmshaven. In the meantime, the armored cruiser had been overwhelmed by concentrated British fire and sunk, while the battlecruiser was severely damaged by an ammunition fire. As a result, Wilhelm II removed von Ingenohl from his post and replaced him with Admiral Hugo von Pohl on 2 February. Recognition drawing of a Helgoland-class battleship The eight I Squadron ships went into the Baltic on 22 February 1915 for unit training, which lasted until 13 March. Following their return to the North Sea, the ships participated in a series of uneventful fleet sorties on 29‚Äì30 March, 17‚Äì18 April, 21‚Äì22 April, 17‚Äì18 May, and 29‚Äì30 May. Th√ºringen and the rest of the fleet then remained in port until 4 August, when I Squadron returned to the Baltic for another round of training maneuvers. From there, the squadron was attached to the naval force that attempted to sweep the Gulf of Riga of Russian naval forces in August 1915. The assault force included the eight I Squadron battleships, the battlecruisers , , and Seydlitz, several light cruisers, 32 destroyers and 13 minesweepers. The plan called for channels to be swept in Russian minefields so that the Russian naval presence, which included the pre-dreadnought , could be eliminated. The Germans would then lay minefields of their own to prevent Russian ships from returning to the Gulf. Th√ºringen and the majority of the other big ships of the High Seas Fleet remained outside the Gulf for the entirety of the operation. The dreadnoughts and were detached on 16 August to escort the minesweepers and to destroy Slava, though they failed to sink the old battleship. After three days, the Russian minefields had been cleared, and the flotilla entered the Gulf on 19 August; reports of Allied submarines in the area prompted a German withdrawal from the Gulf the following day. By 26 August, I Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven. On 23‚Äì24 October, the High Seas Fleet undertook its last major offensive operation under the command of von Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. By January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened von Pohl to the point where he was no longer able to carry out his duties, and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5‚Äì7 March, followed by two more on 21‚Äì22 March and 25‚Äì26 March. During Scheer's next operation, Th√ºringen supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser Seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of I Scouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.  Battle of Jutland  alt=The British fleet sailed from northern Britain to the east while the Germans sailed from Germany in the south; the opposing fleets met off the Danish coast Th√ºringen was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916. The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate. During the operation, Th√ºringen was the second ship in I Division of I Squadron and the tenth ship in the line, directly astern of the squadron flagship Ostfriesland and ahead of another sister Helgoland. I Squadron was the center of the German line, behind the eight - and s of III Squadron. The six elderly pre- dreadnoughts of III and IV Divisions, II Battle Squadron, formed the rear of the formation. Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group encountered the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron under the command of David Beatty. The opposing ships began an artillery duel that saw the destruction of , shortly after 17:00, and , less than half an hour later. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward the main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, K√∂nig, spotted both I Scouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching. The German battlecruisers were steaming to starboard, while the British ships steamed to port. At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point turn to port to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers, and a minute later, the order to open fire was given. While the leading battleships engaged the British battlecruiser squadron, Th√ºringen and ten other battleships, too far out of range to attack the British battlecruisers, fired on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. Th√ºringen and engaged the cruiser , though both ships failed to score a hit. Th√ºringen fired for eight minutes at ranges of , expending twenty-nine 30.5 cm shells. The British destroyers and , which had been disabled earlier in the engagement, laid directly in the path of the advancing High Seas Fleet. Th√ºringen and three other battleships destroyed Nestor with their primary and secondary guns while several III Squadron battleships sank Nomad. Shortly after 19:15, the British dreadnought came into range; Th√ºringen opened fire at 19:25 with her main and secondary battery guns, at ranges of . The ship fired twenty-one 30.5 cm and thirty- seven 15 cm shells in the span of five or six minutes, after which Th√ºringens gunners lost sight of Warspite, without scoring any hits. They then shifted fire to . Th√ºringen fired twenty main battery rounds at Malaya, also unsuccessfully, over seven minutes at a range of before conforming to a 180-degree turn ordered by Scheer to disengage from the British fleet. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night-cruising formation. Th√ºringen was the seventh ship, stationed toward the front of the 24-ship line. An hour later, the leading units of the German line encountered British light forces and a violent firefight at close range ensued. Sometime around 01:10, the armored cruiser stumbled into the German line. Th√ºringen illuminated the vessel with her spotlights and poured salvos of 30.5 cm rounds into the ship at point-blank range. The first salvo struck near Black Princes rear gun turret, which appears to have been blown overboard. Th√ºringen fired a total of ten 30.5 cm, twenty-seven 15 cm, and twenty-four 8.8 cm shells. She was joined by three other battleships, and Black Prince was soon destroyed by a huge ammunition explosion. Around a half an hour later, Th√ºringen spotted what appeared to be a Birkenhead-class cruiser. She fired a star shell to illuminate the British cruiser and opened fire with her secondary guns. The ship was actually the destroyer . Th√ºringen fired eighteen 15 cm and six 8.8 cm shells before launching another star shell. Turbulent appeared to be capsized to starboard, though she remained afloat and was dispatched later by the cruiser and the destroyers and . Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. A few hours later, the fleet arrived in the Jade; Th√ºringen, Helgoland, Nassau, and took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead and four undamaged III Squadron ships anchored just outside the entrance locks to Wilhelmshaven. The remaining eight dreadnoughts entered port, where those that were still in fighting condition restocked ammunition and fuel. In the course of the engagement, Th√ºringen had fired one-hundred and seven 30.5 cm, one-hundred and fifteen 15 cm, and twenty-two 8.8 cm shells, while she and her crew emerged from the battle unscathed.  Subsequent operations  On 18 August, Admiral Scheer attempted to repeat the 31 May operation. The two serviceable German battlecruisers (Moltke and Von der Tann), supported by three dreadnoughts, would bombard Sunderland in an attempt to draw out and destroy Beatty's battlecruisers. The rest of the fleet, including Th√ºringen, would trail behind and provide cover. British signals intelligence informed Jellicoe of the German departure later in the day, and he sent the Grand Fleet out to intercept the Germans. On the approach to the English coast, Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35 on 19 August, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. On 25‚Äì26 September, Th√ºringen and the rest of I Squadron covered an advance conducted by the second commander of the torpedo-boat flotillas (II F√ºhrer der Torpedoboote) to the Terschelling Bank. Scheer conducted another fleet operation on 18‚Äì20 October in the direction of the Dogger Bank, though rudder damage prevented Th√ºringen from participating. For the majority of 1917, Th√ºringen was assigned to guard duty in the German Bight. During Operation Albion, the amphibious assault on the Russian-held islands in the Gulf of Riga, Th√ºringen and her three sisters were moved to the Danish straits to block any possible British attempt to intervene. On 28 October the four ships arrived in Putzig Wiek, and from there steamed to Arensburg on the 29th. On 2 November the operation was completed and Th√ºringen and her sisters began the voyage back to the North Sea. A final abortive fleet sortie took place on 23‚Äì24 April 1918. Th√ºringen, Ostfriesland, and Nassau were formed into a special unit for Operation Schlu√üstein, a planned occupation of St. Petersburg. The three ships reached the Baltic on 10 August, but the operation was postponed and eventually canceled. The special unit was dissolved on 21 August and the battleships were back in Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd. = Fate = Th√ºringen and her three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Gro√üadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, to improve Germany's bargaining position, despite the expected casualties. But many of the war-weary sailors felt that the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on Th√ºringen and then on several other battleships mutinied. Stokers turned off the boilers and refused to work. The following day, the torpedo boats and came alongside and the U-boat pointed her guns at the ship. A significant portion of the crew, 314 sailors and 124 stokers, were arrested and taken off the ship. This was not enough to stop the mutiny, which quickly spread throughout the fleet. The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy\\". Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, was interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Th√ºringen and her three sisters, along with the four Nassau-class battleships, were permitted to remain in Germany during the peace negotiations. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and in their absence Reuter ordered the crews to scuttle the ten battleships and five battlecruisers interned at Scapa Flow. Th√ºringen was decommissioned on 16 December 1918 and used as a barracks ship while she remained in Germany. She was stricken from the naval register on 5 November 1919 and placed out of commission. The fate of the eight remaining German battleships was determined in the Treaty of Versailles, which stated that the ships were to be disarmed and surrendered to the governments of the principal Allied powers. Th√ºringen was surrendered to the French Navy on 29 April 1920 under the name \\"L\\". A skeleton crew took the ship to Cherbourg for the official transfer. Th√ºringen was briefly used as a target ship by the French Navy before sinking off Gavres. The ship was partially broken up in situ in 1923‚Äì1933, though significant portions of the ship remain off the French coast.

It connects to the ribs via cartilage and forms the front of the rib cage, thus helping to protect the heart, lungs, and major blood vessels from injury. Shaped roughly like a necktie, it is one of the largest and longest flat bones of the body. Its three regions are the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. The word \\"sternum\\" originates from the Ancient Greek œÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒΩŒøŒΩ, meaning \\"chest\\".  Structure The sternum is a long, flat bone, forming the middle portion of the front of the chest. The top of the sternum supports the clavicles (collarbones) and its edges join with the costal cartilages of the first two pairs of ribs. The inner surface of the sternum is also the attachment of the sternopericardial ligaments. Its top is also connected to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The sternum consists of three main parts, listed from the top: * Manubrium * Body (gladiolus) * Xiphoid process In its natural position, the sternum is angled obliquely, downward and forward. It is slightly convex in front and concave behind; broad above, shaped like a \\"T\\", becoming narrowed at the point where the manubrium joins the body, after which it again widens a little to below the middle of the body, and then narrows to its lower extremity. In adults the sternum is on average about 17 cm, longer in the male than in the female. = Manubrium= Shape of manubrium The manubrium () is the broad upper part of the sternum. It has a quadrangular shape, narrowing from the top, which gives it four borders. The suprasternal notch (jugular notch) is located in the middle at the upper broadest part of the manubrium. This notch can be felt between the two clavicles. On either side of this notch are the right and left clavicular notches. The manubrium joins with the body of the sternum, the clavicles and the cartilages of the first pair of ribs. The inferior border, oval and rough, is covered with a thin layer of cartilage for articulation with the body. The lateral borders are each marked above by a depression for the first costal cartilage, and below by a small facet, which, with a similar facet on the upper angle of the body, forms a notch for the reception of the costal cartilage of the second rib. Between the depression for the first costal cartilage and the demi-facet for the second is a narrow, curved edge, which slopes from above downward towards the middle. Also, the superior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior side of the manubrium. =Body= The body, or gladiolus, is the longest part. It is flat and considered to have only a front and back surface. It is flat on the front, directed upward and forward, and marked by three transverse ridges which cross the bone opposite the third, fourth, and fifth articular depressions. The pectoralis major attaches to it on either side. At the junction of the third and fourth parts of the body is occasionally seen an orifice, the sternal foramen, of varying size and form. The posterior surface, slightly concave, is also marked by three transverse lines, less distinct, however, than those in front; from its lower part, on either side, the transversus thoracis takes origin. The sternal angle is located at the point where the body joins the manubrium. The sternal angle can be felt at the point where the sternum projects farthest forward. However, in some people the sternal angle is concave or rounded. During physical examinations, the sternal angle is a useful landmark because the second rib attaches here. Each outer border, at its superior angle, has a small facet, which with a similar facet on the manubrium, forms a cavity for the cartilage of the second rib; below this are four angular depressions which receive the cartilages of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. The inferior angle has a small facet, which, with a corresponding one on the xiphoid process, forms a notch for the cartilage of the seventh rib. These articular depressions are separated by a series of curved interarticular intervals, which diminish in length from above downward, and correspond to the intercostal spaces. Most of the cartilages belonging to the true ribs, articulate with the sternum at the lines of junction of its primitive component segments. This is well seen in some other vertebrates, where the parts of the bone remain separated for longer. The upper border is oval and articulates with the manubrium, at the sternal angle. The lower border is narrow, and articulates with the xiphoid process. =Xiphoid process= Located at the inferior end of the sternum is the pointed xiphoid process. Improperly performed chest compressions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation can cause the xiphoid process to snap off, driving it into the liver which can cause a fatal hemorrhage. The sternum is composed of highly vascular tissue, covered by a thin layer of compact bone which is thickest in the manubrium between the articular facets for the clavicles. The inferior sternopericardial ligament attaches the pericardium to the posterior xiphoid process. = Joints = The cartilages of the top five ribs join with the sternum at the sternocostal joints. The right and left clavicular notches articulate with the right and left clavicles, respectively. The costal cartilage of the second rib articulates with the sternum at the sternal angle making it easy to locate. The transversus thoracis muscle is innervated by one of the intercostal nerves and superiorly attaches at the posterior surface of the lower sternum. Its inferior attachment is the internal surface of costal cartilages two through six and works to depress the ribs. =Development= Figure 4 Ossification 180px Figure 6 Peculiarities 180px The sternum develops from two cartilaginous bars one on the left and one on the right, connected with the cartilages of the ribs on each side. These two bars fuse together along the middle to form the cartilaginous sternum which is ossified from six centers: one for the manubrium, four for the body, and one for the xiphoid process. The ossification centers appear in the intervals between the articular depressions for the costal cartilages, in the following order: in the manubrium and first piece of the body, during the sixth month of fetal life; in the second and third pieces of the body, during the seventh month of fetal life; in its fourth piece, during the first year after birth; and in the xiphoid process, between the fifth and eighteenth years. The centers make their appearance at the upper parts of the segments, and proceed gradually downward. To these may be added the occasional existence of two small episternal centers, which make their appearance one on either side of the jugular notch; they are probably vestiges of the episternal bone of the monotremata and lizards. Occasionally some of the segments are formed from more than one center, the number and position of which vary [Fig. 6]. Thus, the first piece may have two, three, or even six centers. When two are present, they are generally situated one above the other, the upper being the larger; the second piece has seldom more than one; the third, fourth, and fifth pieces are often formed from two centers placed laterally, the irregular union of which explains the rare occurrence of the sternal foramen [Fig. 7], or of the vertical fissure which occasionally intersects this part of the bone constituting the malformation known as fissura sterni; these conditions are further explained by the manner in which the cartilaginous sternum is formed. More rarely still the upper end of the sternum may be divided by a fissure. Union of the various centers of the body begins about puberty, and proceeds from below upward [Fig. 5]; by the age of twenty-five they are all united. The xiphoid process may become joined to the body before the age of thirty, but this occurs more frequently after forty; on the other hand, it sometimes remains ununited in old age. In advanced life the manubrium is occasionally joined to the body by bone. When this takes place, however, the bony tissue is generally only superficial, the central portion of the intervening cartilage remaining unossified. In early life, the sternum's body is divided into four segments, not three, called sternebrae (singular: sternebra). Clinical significance =Bone marrow biopsy= Because the sternum contains bone marrow, it is sometimes used as a site for bone marrow biopsy. In particular, patients with a high BMI (obese or grossly overweight) may present with excess tissue that makes access to traditional marrow biopsy sites such as the pelvis difficult. =Sternal opening= A somewhat rare congenital disorder of the sternum sometimes referred to as an anatomical variation is a sternal foramen, a single round hole in the sternum that is present from birth and usually is off-centered to the right or left, commonly forming in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th segments of the breastbone body. Congenital sternal foramina can often be mistaken for bullet holes.Byers, S.N. (2008). Introduction to Forensic Anthropology. Toronto: Pearson. They are usually without symptoms but can be problematic if acupuncture in the area is intended. Manubrium sternal dislocation =Fractures= Fractures of the sternum are rather uncommon. They may result from trauma, such as when a driver's chest is forced into the steering column of a car in a car accident. A fracture of the sternum is usually a comminuted fracture. The most common site of sternal fractures is at the sternal angle. Some studies reveal that repeated punches or continual beatings, sometimes called \\"breastbone punches\\", to the sternum area have also caused fractured sternums. Those are known to have occurred in contact sports such as hockey and football. Sternal fractures are frequently associated with underlying injuries such as pulmonary contusions, or bruised lung tissue. =Dislocation= A manubriosternal dislocation is rare and usually caused by severe trauma. It may also result from minor trauma where there is a precondition of arthritis. =Sternotomy= The breastbone is sometimes cut open (a median sternotomy) to gain access to the thoracic contents when performing cardiothoracic surgery. =Resection= The sternum can be totally removed (resected) as part of a radical surgery, usually to surgically treat a malignancy, either with or without a mediastinal lymphadenectomy (Current Procedural Terminology codes # 21632 and # 21630, respectively). = Bifid sternum or sternal cleft = A bifid sternum is an extremely rare congenital abnormality caused by the fusion failure of the sternum. This condition results in sternal cleft which can be observed at birth without any symptom. Other animals The sternum, in vertebrate anatomy, is a flat bone that lies in the middle front part of the rib cage. It is endochondral in origin. It probably first evolved in early tetrapods as an extension of the pectoral girdle; it is not found in fish. In amphibians and reptiles it is typically a shield-shaped structure, often composed entirely of cartilage. It is absent in both turtles and snakes. In birds it is a relatively large bone and typically bears an enormous projecting keel to which the flight muscles are attached. Only in mammals does the sternum take on the elongated, segmented form seen in humans. =Arthropods= In arachnids, the sternum is the ventral (lower) portion of the cephalothorax. It consists of a single sclerite situated between the coxa, opposite the carapace. Etymology English sternum is a translation of Ancient Greek , '.Triepel, H. (1910). Die anatomischen Namen.

The church was designed by Don Shepherd, a designer and not an architect. The AIA Guide to New York City described it as \\"a minor work but one which calls attention to itself because of its location and the rusted steel crucifix that dominates the corner of the site.\\" History The original church of this parish was erected in 1924 (just across the street from its current location) where the playground area of The Nativity of Our Blessed Lady School (3893 Dyre Avenue) is located. The Nativity of Our Blessed Lady church's cornerstone is dated 1969. The grammar school opened in 1953 and has seen different orders of educators, including the Sisters of Mercy the Sisters of Charity, and Dominicans. While the original church was being constructed, masses for the community's primarily Italian, German, and Irish parishioners were conducted at Brienlinger's Hall,a popular party and dance hall, at the corner of Boston Post Road (Route 1) and Dyre Avenue. In the summer of 1923, a huge tent was erected on the corner of East 233rd and Secor Avenue, where the present Nativity church now stands, and Masses were held there. When the original church opened in 1924, Marina Cosentino made crocheted-border tablecloths for the altar. There were also movie nights and minstrel shows inside the original church during the 1920s. The original Nativity church was destroyed by fire in 1958. During the fire, two or three men rushed into the church to climb up into the niche above the altar and rescue the beautiful wood-carved statue of the Blessed Mother and carry it out of the church before it burned. For the next twenty years it remained in a school janitorial closet, before being disposed of. After the original church burned, Masses and church events were held in the school auditorium for a decade, with a makeshift altar on the auditorium's small stage and rows of folding chairs serving as pews. Large oscillating fans were brought into the auditorium during the summer months. Masses continued there until the construction and opening of the new and present Nativity church in 1969, the interior of which features textured stucco-type walls and dark wood accents on the altar and confessionals, as well as contrasting red wood pews. A large Crucifix hangs on the back wall at the center of the altar, and a very contemporary, very large, even overpowering wood-sculpted risen Christ with arms extended to Heaven covers the altar's side wall by the organ and added piano. The Stations of the Cross hang as large wood-carved plaques, partially illuminated by ten skylights (in addition to the large skylight positioned directly above the altar's center table structure, divided into four sections by two substantial crossing beams), and more modern additions include carpeting on the altar, electronic candle bays, and a large painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe near the original tabernacle (a much smaller tabernacle now occupies the back of the altar, partially obscuring the large Crucifix there). The acoustics system is exceptional in its clarity and resonance. The church's congregation now represents many ethnic groups, reflecting the residential population of the Eastchester area.

They returned to Oberliga play in 1929 for a three-year turn that ended after a 9th-place finish in 1932. In 1930, the club took part in the Berliner Landespokal (Berlin Cup) and went out 1‚Äì2 to Minerva Berlin in a quarterfinal match.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7.

Each club enjoyed a 2‚Äì0 victory over the other before SV won the third and deciding match 4‚Äì0. Polizei would be in and out of Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I) play over the next ten years through to the end of World War II. They made their only appearance in national cup play in the opening round of the Tschammerspokal, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup), in 1938, where they were put out by Vorw√§rts-Rasensport Gleiwitz (2‚Äì3).Gr√ºne, Hardy (1996). Vom Kronprinzen bis zur Bundesliga. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag In 1941, the club was renamed Sportgemeinschaft der Ordnungspolizei Berlin. They began the 1944‚Äì45 season in second-division play, but re-joined Gauliga competition to take the place of air force team Luftwaffen SV Berlin which was disbanded in September 1944. Following the war, occupying Allied authorities banned organizations across the country, including sports and football clubs, a part of the process of de-Nazification. Polizei was not re-established until 17 July 1949 under the name Polizei SV Gr√ºn-Wei√ü Berlin. The re-constituted club was banned in 1950, but quickly remade as VfL Sportfreunde Berlin. It took on its identity as a police side again on 31 December 1952 when it returned to its roots as Polizei SV. The division of the city during the Cold War into eastern and western sectors led the formation of a second police club known as SG Volkspolizei Potsdam which became part of the separate competition that emerged in East Germany. Throughout this period, the SV played as a lower tier local side. The club returned to note in 1957, fielding a strong side in the Amateurliga Berlin (II) that finished second in 1959 and won the division title in 1960. They passed on the opportunity for promotion to the Oberliga Berlin to remain in second-tier play and allowing third-placed BSC Kickers 1900 to advance in their stead, along with vice-champions BFC S√ºdring. That title put Polizei into qualifying play for the German national amateur championship, where they were immediately eliminated (1‚Äì3) by 1. FC Kaiserslautern (Amateure). The team crashed the next year, ending the 1960‚Äì61 season at the bottom of the table in 16th place. After a two-year absence, Polizei returned to the Amateurliga in 1963, which had become a third-tier circuit with the formation of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional first division. They would remain an Amateurliga side until being relegated in 1977. Generally a mid-to-lower-tier club, their best result over this period was a 3rd place earned in 1973‚Äì74. In 1991, the football department of the police club merged with 1. FC Concordia Gropiusstadt-Buckow to create PSV Concordia Gropiusstadt.

Opened in 1865, it forms part of the Adriatic Railway (Ancona‚ÄìLecce), and is also a junction for, and terminus of, the Taranto‚ÄìBrindisi railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Brindisi railway station is situated at Piazza Francesco Crispi, at the southwest edge of the city centre. History The station was opened on 29 April 1865, during an era of economic expansion, upon the inauguration of the Bari‚ÄìBrindisi section of the Adriatic Railway. Nearly nine months later, on 15 January 1866, the Adriatic Railway was extended from Brindisi to Lecce. Built like a typical transit station, the passenger building had a structure characterized by a sloping flat roof covering the two through tracks and the pedestrian level crossing between platforms. On 30 December 1886, Brindisi became a junction station, when the final section of the Taranto‚ÄìBrindisi railway was opened, between Mesagne and Brindisi. Features Today, the station has eight tracks used by Trenitalia, and a link with the Brindisi Marittima railway station, once connected by ship to Greece, but now dismantled. The station was included in the Centostazioni program of rehabilitation of the main Italian stations. At Brindisi, the rehabilitation project includes an increase and reorganization of space for passengers with significant improvements in services.

Harries was born in 1550, the eldest of four sons of John Harries, of Cruckton in Shropshire. His mother was Eleanor, daughter of Thomas Prowde of Sutton. Thomas Harries is believed to be the Thomas Harris who was Member of Parliament for Shrewsbury in 1586. Another possibility is that it was Thomas Harris of Boreatton, also a resident of Shrewsbury, and who like Harries was also a member of Lincoln's Inn. Thomas Harris of Boreatton was created a baronet at about the same time as Thomas Harries, making precise identification difficult. The History of Parliament however considers this Thomas Harries as the most likely candidate as the MP. Harries was educated at Shrewsbury School from 1565, and later at Clement's Inn and then Lincoln's Inn from 1575. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1583. He was active in legal affairs in Shrewsbury, and helped in the securing of a new town charter in 1584. He contested the Parliamentary seat for Shrewsbury that year, but was defeated, coming third in the poll. He was returned unopposed in 1586. He became a serjeant-at-law in February 1604. He became a bencher at Lincoln's Inn in 1596, and was possibly the Thomas Harris who was appointed justice of the peace of Shropshire c. 1600, and Cheshire in 1601. In 1613 he bought Tong Castle from Sir Edward Stanley, and on 12 April 1623 was created a baronet, of Tong Castle.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume 1 1900 He was married to Eleanor, daughter of Roger Gifford, physician to Queen Elizabeth I. The couple had one son, Francis, and three daughters, but Francis and one of the daughters predeceased their father, and the baronetcy became extinct on Sir Thomas's death on 18 February 1628. Tong Castle passed to the family of his daughter Elizabeth, who married William Pierrepont; in 1764 Evelyn Pierrepont, 2nd Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull sold it to George Durant. Sir Thomas's second daughter, Anne, married the jurist John Wilde.

Tong Castle George Durant (20 November 1731 - 4 August 1780) was a British landowner and politician. Life Durant was born the second son of the Reverend Josiah Durant, rector of Hagley, Worcestershire and educated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. As a young man he had an affair with Elizabeth Lyttleton, the second wife of George Lyttelton, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. To escape the consequent scandal he became a senior clerk in the Army Pay Office and was sent with the Army as paymaster on an expedition to Havana, which was a lucrative posting. On his return as a wealthy man he purchased the village of Tong in Shropshire from the Duke of Kingston in 1764, knocked down the ancient Tong Castle, and built in its place a new house in a unique style based on plans drawn up by Capability Brown. Between 1768 and 1774 he was Member of Parliament for Evesham. He stood for election again in 1774 but was badly defeated. He died in 1780 and was buried in St Bartholomew's Church, Tong. He had married Maria, the daughter of Mark Beaufoy, with whom he had a son, also named George, and a daughter. Tong Castle passed to his son, who proved to be a somewhat lascivious Lord of the Manor.

She is a co-creator and performer with the comedy- pop, undie-rock band The Skivvies. Her Broadway credits include Johanna in the actor-musician revival of Sweeney Todd,. To describe her as an actress, one reviewer said \\"She's part Mary Martin, Lucille Ball, Kristen Wiig and [fill in the blank with your favorite opera star because Molina has one of the most powerful and flexible voices in the annals of Broadway].\\" While performing on the first national tour of Sweeney Todd, she received the Independent Reviewers of New England (IRNE) Award for Best Supporting Actress. She won a Helen Hayes award for her portrayal of Cunegunde in Candide (2010-2011), directed by Mary Zimmerman at the Shakespeare Theatre in DC, and received an IRNE nomination for the same role at the Huntington Theatre. She originated the role of Bella Rose in Desperate Measures (2017-2018) Off-Broadway and received nominations for the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical and Outer Critics Circle for Best Supporting Actress. In 2019, she and her Skivvies partner Nick Cearley co-conceived a new actor-musician revival of \\"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\\", also playing Lucy and Linus, at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park.

Molina is a newcomer‚Äîshe only recently graduated from college‚Äîbut she taps into Johanna with an all-consuming honesty and range. Given her unconventional good looks and delicacy of frame, filmmakers in the sixties and seventies like Lumet, Coppola, and others would have snatched Molina up as quickly as they did the late, great Elizabeth Hartman, who conveyed an effect similar to Molina's in ‚ÄúThe Group,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Big Boy Now,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Beguiled‚Äù ‚Äîthat of a highly intelligent actress in love with being someone other than herself.\\" In 2008, she originated the role of Regina/Candi in the 80's rock musical Rock of Ages off-Broadway at New World Stages.

It is the sequel to his previous werewolf novel Frostbite, though this novel is only available in print; it was not first published online like some of his other novels. Plot summary The novel picks up shortly after the end of Frostbite following werewolves Cheyenne ‚ÄúChey‚Äù Clark and Montgomery ‚ÄúMonty‚Äù Powell as they travel toward the Arctic Circle in search of a cure for the curse of lycanthropy that has afflicted them both. Along the way they are joined by Dzo, the personification of the Inuit muskrat spirit, and Lucie, the French werewolf who gave Monty the curse of lycanthropy. They are pursued by Varkanin, a Russian hunter who has blue skin from silver poisoning that renders him nearly-immune to werewolf attacks, who is in the employ of the Canadian government that wants the werewolves killed so they can sign an oil development agreement with a foreign energy company. The search for the cure to the werewolves' condition is complicated by Chey's gradual loss of her human identity to her increasingly wolf-like nature. The nature of werewolves in Overwinter Werewolves in Overwinter have only two forms; human and lupine. They cannot control the change, and take on lupine form at any time that the moon is above the horizon, regardless of the moon's phase. The lupine form is similar to a normal wolf, but significantly stronger and more aggressive, bearing an intense hatred of humans. They have elements of the dire wolf, including unusually wicked teeth. Even in human form, the werewolf is notably stronger, faster and more resilient than a normal human of its physique. Werewolves in either form have only a hazy recollection of events in their other form. Though the lupine form hates its own human form as much as (or more than) other humans, there is a slight mental connection, and the lupine form will often try to complete a task that the human form was engaged in when it changed. Still, some werewolves in human form are known to think of \\"their wolf\\" as a separate entity. Unlike many representations of werewolves, one form does not \\"morph\\" into the other. Rather, it is as if the body becomes ephemeral and a new body is created, at every change. As a result, werewolves seem to be unaging, as a new perfect body (healed of injuries) is created for it at moonrise and moonset. Werewolves are also apparently immortal, as a dead werewolf (in either form) will return to life with the next change, unless silver is employed to kill it. Silver is the nemesis of werewolves, as even a relatively light binding of silver chain cannot be broken by one. The effects of long-term contact with silver, or of silver weaponry, are not yet clear. It is known that contact with silver bindings in lupine form can leave a lasting mark when the werewolf regains human form. Reception Wellington‚Äôs novel, like most of his other horror novels, earned largely positive reviews on horror review sites. In an upbeat appraisal The Horror Review called it ‚Äúa fast-paced and highly original werewolf thriller‚Äù. The Bloodsprayer.com gave it similar praise calling the novel the ‚Äúperfect follow up to Frostbite, with enough action and gore to entertain and keep that ‚Äòhorror‚Äô edge‚Äù.

Life His real surname was Bayart or Beyard, and he was born in London on 27 March 1597. He entered Leyden University on 16 June 1610. He matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford, in October 1614, and graduated B.A. in December of the same year, having been allowed to count a semester when he studied logic at the University of Leyden. He proceeded M.A. in 1617. In 1622 Bayart, known from that time as Hyde, became a Catholic, and entered the English College at Douai on 6 January 1623. He studied philosophy there under Harrington, and divinity, and was ordained priest in 1625. Succeeding his master Harrington, he remained for four more years in the college, as professor of philosophy. He returned to England, where he remained for a few years, holding the chaplaincy to John Preston of Furness Abbey in 1631, and the same office in the household of Henry Parker, 5th Baron Monteagle in 1632. In 1633 he went back to Douai, and lectured on divinity; some of his letters written about this time are preserved. Driven from Douai by the plague about 1636, he became chaplain to the Blount family of Soddington, Worcestershire, where he remained for three years, holding during part of that time the Roman Catholic office of archdeacon of Worcester and Salop. He afterwards entered the family of Humphrey Weld, who during Hyde's chaplaincy in 1641 purchased Lulworth Castle, Dorset. In 1641 George Muscott, held as a prisoner in England, was appointed President of the college at Douai; Hyde agreed to fill his place, and arrived in Douay on 12 October 1641. Meanwhile, Muscott was unexpectedly set free and banished. He then assumed the presidency, and Hyde acted as vice-president, with a papal pension, until Muskett's death in 1645. He succeeded as President on 21 July 1646, and was created a D.D. in the year following. As president Hyde cleared the college of a heavy load of debt, increased its library, and settled a controversy about the degrees of missioners. The Bishop of Arras made him censor librorum in 1648. He became canon of St. Amalus, and was appointed both regius professor of history and public orator in the University of Douai in 1649. In March 1651 Charles II of England paid the college a visit, and Hyde presented him with an address. Hyde died on 22 December 1651, and was buried in Our Lady's chapel in the church of St. James at Douay. By his will he left the English College over nine thousand florins.

Early life He was the eldest son of Maria Scott Brennen (1875‚Äì1934) and William Perkins Bull (1870‚Äì1948) KC of Eaton Place in London and Lorne Hall in Rosedale, Toronto, Canada. Bull was president of the Okanagan Lumber Company, the founder and director of the Canadian Oil Company, president of the Sterling Oil Company, the founder of Red Deer Investments, and founder, director and treasurer of the Mississauga Lumber Company. Born in Toronto, he was educated in England at Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. He subsequently studied law, passing bar examinations in criminal law and procedure in 1925 and property and conveyancing in 1926. Bull won Eton's long-distance swimming championship, in 1920. Career He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1928. In the same year he moved to Bartle, Cuba, to manage his family's cattle ranch and sugar plantation. On return to England he began to practice law on the South Eastern Circuit. In early 1931, Bull \\"suffered an attack of poisoning\\" while in Cuba. In February 1935, Bull was chosen by the Enfield District Conservative Association to contest the local constituency at the next general election, in place of the retiring member of parliament, Lieutenant-Colonel R V K Applin. He retained the seat for the Conservatives at the general election held in October 1935. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Bull obtained a commission in the Coldstream Guards. He took part in the North African Campaign, and was badly wounded at the Battle of Sidi Barrani. Bull lost his Commons seat at the 1945 general election, when it was one of many won by the Labour Party in a political landslide. On leaving parliament, Bull returned to his legal practice. Personal life In 1931, Bull was married to Rosemary Baur (1911‚Äì2006), an American who was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College dubbed \\"Chicago's richest debutante.\\" She was the daughter of Jacob Baur, the father of the Soda fountain and inherited $2.5-$3 million from a trust established by her father.

The term was coined by U.S. sociologist Vincent N. Parrillo to identify the centuries-old phenomenon.Parrillo, Vincent N., ‚ÄúDiversity in America: A Sociohistorical Analysis,‚Äù Sociological Forum 9:4 (1994): 523-45. Parrillo drew the name from a special commission created in 1907 by President Theodore Roosevelt to look into the ‚Äúimmigration problem.‚Äù Named after its chairman, U.S. Senator William P. Dillingham of Vermont, the Dillingham Commission over a 4-year period listened to testimony from civic leaders, educators, social scientists, and social workers and made on-site visits to Ellis Island and New York City‚Äôs Lower East Side. In 1911, the Commission issued a 41-volume report of its findings. Unfortunately, the report was flawed in its interpretation of the data that the Commission had so tirelessly collected. The Commission erred in its use of simplistic categories for diverse immigrant groups and in making an unfair comparison of ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù immigrants, despite the changed structural conditions and longer time interval that previous immigrants had to assimilate and to achieve some measure of economic security.Benton-Cohen, Katherine, ‚ÄúThe Rude Birth of Immigration Reform,‚Äù The Wilson Quarterly 34:3 (Summer 2010): 16-22; Weisberger, Bernard A., ‚ÄúGenes, Brains, and Bunk,‚Äù American Heritage 46:2 (1995): 28-9; Lund, John M., ‚ÄúBoundaries of Restriction: The Dillingham Commission,‚Äù History Review 6 (1994), accessed at . The Dillingham Flaw refers to inaccurate comparisons of immigrant groups based on simplistic categorizations and anachronistic observations. Parrillo argued that this erroneous thinking can occur in assessments of the past, present, or future. The past Applying modern classifications or sensibilities to a time when they did not exist, or, if they did, had a different form or meaning, is one version of the Dillingham Flaw. For example, today's term British refers collectively to the people of the United Kingdom (the English, Welsh, Scots, and Scots-Irish). However, in the 18th century, British had the much narrower meaning for only the English, and for good reason. The English, Welsh, Scots, and Scots-Irish may have all been English- speaking, but significant cultural and religious differences existed among them and they did not view each other as ‚Äúsimilar.‚ÄùFuchs, Lawrence H., The American Kaleidoscope: Race, Ethnicity, and the Civic Culture, Hanover, NH: Wesleyan University Press of New England, 1990, p. 12. Anyone who presumes that the colonial British, even just the colonial English, were a single cohesive entity, and thus the 13 English colonies were homogeneous, would fall victim to the Dillingham Flaw.Nash, Gary B., ed., Class and Society in Early America, Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1970, p. 19; Vincent N. Parrillo, Diversity in America, 3d ed. Los Angeles: Pine Forge Press, 2009, pp. 15, 39-58. A similar trap is speaking about either African slaves or Native Americans as single, monolithic entities generations ago. Such ethnocentric generalizations fail to acknowledge that these groups actually consisted of diverse peoples with distinctive languages, cultures, and behavior patterns.Bridenbaugh, Carl, Myths and Realities: Societies of the Colonial South, reprint ed., Santa Barbara, Calif: Greenwood Press, 1981; Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., The Indian Heritage of America, New York: Mariner Books, 1991. Similarly, European immigrants were not alike, despite their collective groupings by mainstream society.Handlin, Oscar, The Uprooted: The Epic Story of the Great Migrations That Made the American People, 2d ed. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2002. Instead, all of these groups‚ÄîAfrican American, Native American, and immigrant‚Äîwere diverse peoples with many distinctions that set them apart from one another. The present Similar misconceptions can, and often do, occur in one's own time. Working from a false premise about past rapid assimilation and cultural homogeneity, some individuals employ what they believe is an objective comparison with the present scene, which they find troubling in its heterogeneity and supposedly non-assimilating groups. Like the 1907 Dillingham Commission, they may be susceptible to mistaken impressions about a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù posed by recent immigrants whose presence and behavior they view as different from earlier immigrants. The most common examples are expressed views that today's immigrant minorities present an unprecedented challenge to an integrative society. Reacting to the increasing presence‚Äîeven in many nonurban settings‚Äîof nonwhite newcomers speaking a foreign tongue, including many from a non-Judeo- Christian background, nativists view with alarm these demographic changes. Such fears are echoes of those raised about earlier groups, such as the racist responses to the physical appearance of Southern Europeans or the anti-Semitic reactions to eastern European Jews.See, for example, Milton M. Gordon, Assimilation in American Life, New York: Oxford University Press, 1964, p. 97; Madison Grant, The Passing of the Great Race, reprint ed., Charleston, SC: Nabu Press, 2010.

The future Using oversimplified categorizations and imposing present-day sensibilities‚Äîthe essence of the Dillingham Flaw‚Äîalso can occur when individuals engage in demographic projections. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau projects that Hispanics will comprise about 30 percent of the total U.S. population in 2050.U.S. Census Bureau, ‚ÄúNational Population Projections,‚Äù 2008, accessed at . Given past patterns and current trends, however, we cannot be certain that today's group categories, such as Hispanic, will still be valid by then. Currently, most white Americans bear witness to mixed European ancestry, but two generations ago, Americans of southern, central, and eastern European backgrounds were far more likely to be of a single national lineage and religion. Their single-group identities evolved into multiple-group identities, as large-scale intermarriages generated such a blending of peoples that ‚Äúwhites‚Äù and ‚ÄúEuropean Americans‚Äù became synonymous. Further, their mixed heritage is now more likely to be passively acknowledged, except for occasional symbolic celebrations. It is no longer an element of everyday ethnicity, subcultural participation, or minority status. Each succeeding year shows greater numbers of exogamous marriages among ethnic, racial, and religious groups.U.S. Census Bureau, 2011 Statistical Abstract, Table 60 Therefore, it is not unreasonable, for example, to suggest‚Äîgiven the annual increase in Hispanics marrying non-HispanicsU.S. Census Bureau, 2011 Statistical Abstract, Table 60‚Äîthat in two generations many of the descendants of today's Hispanic Americans will claim a mixed heritage, partly Hispanic and partly non-Hispanic. Projections that the mid-21st century will find the United States with a Hispanic population totaling 30 percent suggests a demographic categorization by today's realities that may well not fit the reality then. A similar argument could be made for other groups, as racial intermarriages continue to create a growing multiracial population.U.S. Census Bureau, 2011 Statistical Abstract, Table 60 Using today's categories for Americans living in 2050 can easily be another unwitting application of the Dillingham Flaw. Projecting our perceptions and the existing social distance between groups onto a distant future carries a presumption that they will remain the same. However, our present-day categories may be inadequate or irrelevant to our descendants.

He became a Serjeant-at-Law and King's Serjeant in 1689, acting as counsel during a number of cases before the House of Lords. He also represented Tregony in Parliament between 1690 and 1694. Early and family life Tremayne was baptised in Mevagissey, Cornwall, on 16 September 1647, the first son of Colonel Lewis Tremayne (1619‚Äì1685) and Mary (1625‚Äì1701), daughter and co- heiress of John Carew of Penwarne. In 1680 he married Frances (baptised 1655, died 1683), daughter of William Davie of Sandford, Devon. They had one son, John, who died young in about 1692. He succeeded his father to the Heligan estate in 1685, where in 1692 he rebuilt the house using Heligan bricks in William and Mary style. His death is recorded by Narcissus Luttrell on 20 February 1694, but the exact date is unknown. On 23 February, he was buried in the Temple Church, London. The estate passed to his younger brother Charles (1650‚Äì1695), ancestor of Henry Hawkins Tremayne (1741‚Äì1829), who initiated the creation of the gardens now known as the Lost Gardens of Heligan. Career After studying law, he was called to the bar in 1673, after entering the Inner Temple in 1666 and transferring to the Middle Temple in 1669. In May 1689 he was called with others to be Serjeant-at-Law, and was made a King's Serjeant, representing the Crown in court. His name frequently occurs in cases before the House of Lords from 1689 to 1693; he was counsel for the Crown against Richard Graham, 1st Viscount Preston and others for high treason in January 1691, was engaged for Sir John Germaine in the action brought against him by Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk for adultery with Mary, Duchess of Norfolk, and he acted for the crown on the trial of Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun for the murder of actor William Mountfort in January 1693. He was knighted on 31 October 1689, and in 1690 was returned as Member of Parliament for the Cornish borough of Tregony. In June 1692 he was a candidate for the Recorder of London, but was beaten at the poll. Pleas of the Crown in Matters Criminal and Civil was published in 1723 after being \\"digested and revised\\" by John Rice of Furnival's Inn.

B. Thompson Mansion, also known as Alder Manor, is a historic home located on North Broadway (U.S. Route 9) in the Greystone section of Yonkers, New York, United States. It is an early 20th-century mansion designed by Carr√®re and Hastings in the Renaissance Revival architectural style. In 1982, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was built by William Boyce Thompson, a mining tycoon and financier, as his weekend home. At the turn of the century, large riverside estates characterized much of Yonkers; today the Thompson Mansion is one of the few to have survived the city's 20th-century urbanization. The Thompson family lived there until the mid-20th century; afterwards it was willed to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and became Mary Elizabeth Seton High School, the first Catholic school in Yonkers. After ten years as a high school, it was upgraded to a junior college. A few years after merging with Iona College, the campus was closed. While the other buildings on the property were repurposed, the mansion fell into neglect and was looted until Tara Circle, an Irish American cultural organization, bought it from the city. To raise money for its restoration, Tara Circle holds occasional events there and rents it out for weddings and filming for movies such as Mona Lisa Smile and A Beautiful Mind. Building and grounds The mansion is located in the northwestern corner of Yonkers, on bluffs above the Hudson River a thousand feet () to the west. It is on the west side of North Broadway, set back from the road atop a slight rise, at the end of a curving driveway flanked by shrubs and small trees that ends in a paved forecourt with a stone balustrade. On the opposite side of North Broadway is the South Westchester Executive Park with taller modern buildings. To the north is the Lenoir Nature Preserve, a Westchester County park. St. John's Riverside Hospital is on the south. The trailway along the Old Croton Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark, passes through the woods next to the preserve on the steep slopes leading westward down to the river. At the river itself are some modern high-rise apartment buildings around the Greystone station on Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line. Around the house is extensive landscaping. There are terraces and sculpture gardens to the south. It is complemented on the north by a walled classically inspired garden with many authentic Roman artifacts. At its west end is a replica of the Theatre of Dionysus in Athens. =Exterior= The main building is a 2¬Ω-story seven-bay limestone structure on a full basement. Its main block is topped by a tiled hipped roof pierced by chimneys and alternating hipped and gabled dormer windows set with one-over-one double-hung sash. A small two-bay wing projects from the south. On the north end is a two-story service wing, itself with two small wings. A brick terrace continuing the stone balustrade from the forecourt surrounds the building; there are loggias at the north and south ends. The north facade incorporates the facade of an actual 16th-century Italian church. All bays below the roof on the main block are set with multi- pane casement windows; the service wing's windows are six-over-six double-hung sash. In the center of the west (rear) face is an elaborate garden entrance. At the first story three French doors are recessed in a Palladian arcade. Above them is an entablature and central arch flanked by oval windows and supported by a combination of pilasters and freestanding columns. =Interior= On the opposite side, a broken pediment above the segmental arched main entrance is supported by engaged columns. It has other classical detailing. Doors of glass and wrought iron open into a vestibule with marble floors and terra cotta bas-reliefs. The marble floors continue into the entrance hall, with a plaster ceiling designed by Thomas Hastings. All other floors are wooden parquet, with the exception of tile in the kitchen. Some of the doors retain their original Gorham knobs. Many of the original artwork and finishes also remain. The drawing room has walnut panelling and bolection molding with carved birds, flowers and swags around the fireplace. Above it is a rare English-style trompe-l'≈ìil ceiling. An Italian-style coffered ceiling is in the music room, complementing its imported 15th-century Italian stone fireplace. The dining room has French-style coffering; both it and the library have oak paneling and classically inspired carved white marble mantelpieces. The stairwell is three stories high. The main stair has a carved iron and wood rail, and the walls feature pilasters, entablatures and railings, all forming low colonnades at each level. At the top organ pipes of a Welte Philharmonic Organ are arranged in the shape of a window frame. What appears to be paneling along the walls of the upper stories is actually a line of closets. The master bedroom has another imported European fireplace; in the other bedrooms are more classically inspired carved ones. At the northern end of the second floor is a tiled indoor pool with a stained glass window looking out on the garden. The basement den has been extensively remodeled, but it still has an Asian design and a Chinese decorative wood carving along the stair leading to it. History After success in the mining industry in his native Montana, William Boyce Thompson came to New York in 1895. He continued to be involved in mining as an investor on Wall Street, and made more money. A decade later, he began acquiring the on which he built his mansion. Originally called Alder Manor after Alder Gulch, his hometown, it was intended to be a weekend residence. He commissioned Carr√®re and Hastings to design the house. As a lover of plants and gardens, Thompson had supervised the planning and planting of the landscapes around the house, and retained considerable influence over it. While the house has many similarities with the Frick Mansion in New York City, which the firm was designing and building at the same time, the Thompson Mansion has some touches that reflect his personal preferences, such as the colored marble in some columns, imported fireplaces, and classical detailing in the gardens. Thompson lived in the house until his death in 1930. He left $20 million ($ in modern dollars) in trust to his wife and daughter on condition that they continue to live at Alder Manor. Gertrude Thompson lived there for another 20 years. After her 1950 death, she willed it to the Archdiocese of New York, which decided to use it as a Catholic high school. The Sisters of Charity ran it as Mary Elizabeth Seton High School, Yonkers' first Catholic secondary school. In 1960 they upgraded it to a junior college. At that time some modifications were made. The addition of a chapel and a fire escape were done discreetly, with great sensitivity to the architecture. On the inside, however, some rooms were modified extensively to serve as bedrooms and offices. Among these were the basement den, where Thompson had displayed his gem collection. Its Chinese-themed decor was greatly minimized, and only the woodwork remains today. The college also built a dorm to the west, blocking the view of the Hudson the mansion had once enjoyed. In 1989, Elizabeth Seton College merged with Iona College. For a while Iona used both campuses, due to space limitations across the county at its New Rochelle campus. Six years after the merger, in 1995, Iona closed the campus and consolidated operations in New Rochelle. The property began to be subdivided and sold. It was attractive to developers since it was one of the few large mostly unbuilt parcels in Yonkers with river views. The city bought including the mansion and other buildings, the latter of which it used as an elementary school. A developer bought the remaining land to the south and built an assisted living center. The mansion remained unused and vacant. Signs of neglect became apparent, and it became a target for vandals and thieves. Among the items stolen were the brass nameplate at the main entrance, a chandelier and a Tiffany glass window. The city put out a request for proposals from interested parties. Two years later, in 1997, it accepted a proposal from Tara Circle, an Irish American cultural organization, which had been looking for a permanent home for ten years. On June 16 of that year, it held its first event, a Bloomsday celebration. The mansion cost the group $1.2 million to acquire, and it was estimated that fully restoring it would take another $2 million. Throughout the 2000s Tara Circle made limited use of the building due to its condition. It offers classes in Irish music and culture, and has hosted a concert by Ronan Tynan. Further revenue has been raised by renting the mansion for weddings and banquets, and film shoots. It was first used in that latter capacity as the mansion where Russell Crowe as mathematician John Nash drops mail off there in the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. It was also used for scenes in The Royal Tenenbaums and Mona Lisa Smile.

The largest is Green Mountain Power, a subsidiary of √ânergir which recently also took over Central Vermont Public Service. Together this single company represents 70% of the retail customers in Vermont. The state is a small electricity consumer compared with other states. Therefore, its electricity sector has the lowest carbon footprint in the country. As of 2010, the state had the lowest wholesale electricity costs in New England. Efficiency Vermont engages in aggressive initiatives to cut residential electricity waste, which often identifies other problems (leaks, pest entry points, mold, rot) that it claims can save hundreds per household per year. Accordingly, Vermont's overall energy bills are also relatively lower than in the rest of the New England states. Vermont also has arguably the most technologically advanced transmission grid in the US, linked by of optical fiber cable which is available not only for smart grid applications but also for connectivity purposes for Vermont communities. The state-owned transmission utility VELCO (Vermont Electric Power Company) has marketed this capacity for municipal broadband, WISP and commercial ISPs as backhaul.  Vehicle fuels  Vermont, like most of the US, relies on gasoline and diesel as primary vehicle fuels. Electric vehicle charging stations are still uncommon in rural areas, and electric vehicles (whose batteries are affected by cold climates) are not in widespread use.  Heating  Half of all Vermont households heat their homes with fuel oil. Another 36% use natural gas or propane, and 12% use wood. Almost 20% use more than one type of heating system. Wood grows abundantly in Vermont and in rural areas many people rely on their own woodlots, or locally harvested wood, as their primary source of home heating. Vermont's 2016 Comprehensive Energy Plan (CEP) \\"calls for increasing the share of Vermont's total building heating demand met with wood heating from 21 percent in 2016 to 35 percent by 2030.\\" Insurance usually demands an electric or fossil source as well so that wood stoves and furnaces are not left unattended. Although wood is a renewable resource, black carbon and carbon dioxide emissions from wood stoves pose pollution and climate concerns. Vermont has about 100 commercial or institutional bulk wood pellet fueled systems, and 62 are commercial or institutional woodchip systems. Efficiency Vermont encourages and facilitates transition to heavier household insulation, ground source heat pumps, electric split pumps, and modern EPA-approved wood-burning stoves and furnaces.  Industrial and agricultural uses  Direct utilization of wind, water, sun and geothermal power by industrial plants and mills is now very uncommon in the state except for a few artisan or demonstration or museum projects. Windmills are still used for water pumping in some areas but increasingly this generates electricity to drive an on-demand pump, rather than operating only when the wind is blowing.  Electricity  = Grid = Vermont has one of the most sophisticated smart grid implementations in the United States. In 2012 the state, VELCO and all 20 distribution utilities built (with contractor IBM) a 17-terabit-capable dark fiber optic network to all electrical substations in Vermont, at a cost of about $53 million recovered from operations savings (mostly prevention of outages). By contrast with other smart grid initiatives in Tennessee and Virginia, where universal wired fiber communication connectivity was a major goal, VELCO cited its internal \\"high-bandwidth, two- way communication requirements [for] synchophasors\\" and latency-sensitive protocols that respond to shifts in demand in under 50ms (one-twentieth of a second) to prevent problems. About of fiber was deployed to 65 substations, reaching nearly 70 percent of Vermont's towns. This capacity was considered in setting Vermont's 10-year Telecommunications Plan that would \\"essentially require fiber optic broadband speeds to every Vermont home by 2024\\" as mandated by the National Broadband Plan (United States). Providers like ECFiber have reached many Vermont towns using public backhaul already. In 2015 the FCC ruled in favour of public and thus also ratepayer subsidies that achieve economic development goals. Accordingly, there was no regulatory barrier to deploying grid fiber for this need. = Supply = In 2013, the total summer generating capacity of Vermont was 1,235 megawatts.  Imports  Since the 1980s, the state has turned to Quebec, its northern neighbor, to fulfill part of its energy needs. A first long-term supply contract has been signed between Vermont utilities and government-owned Hydro-Qu√©bec on July 25, 1984. The contract was renewed for 26 years in a deal signed in 2010. Despite the closing of Vermont Yankee, the state continued to rely on nuclear fission power imported from Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant in NH.  Renewable energy  In May 2009, Vermont created the first statewide renewable energy feed-in law. In 2010, there were about 150 methane digesters in the nation, Vermont led the nation with six online. The state has 78 hydro power dams with a combined capacity of 143 MW, about 12 percent of the state's total requirement. Vermont experts estimate that the state has the capacity to ultimately generate from 134 to 175 MW of electricity from hydro power. = Transmission = All Vermont utilities get their power from lines run by ISO New England. Each utility pays a share of transmitting power over these lines. Vermont's share is about 4.5 percent. A unique aspect of Vermont's electric power system is the Vermont Electric Power Company (VELCO.) VELCO is a utility that's sole purpose is to maintain the state's main transmission lines which move power through the state and deliver it to the various customer-facing utilities' systems throughout the state. VELCO is owned collectively by the state's customer-facing utilities and operates the higher voltage 115 kV, 345 kV, and HVDC lines throughout the state as well as the major transmission substations. The customer facing utilities, such as Green Mountain Power, maintain lower voltage subtransmission lines (below 69 kV) which bring power from the major VELCO transmission substations to smaller distribution substations as well as the distribution lines that bring power from substations to customers. = Demand = In 2005, the inhabitants of the state used an average of 5,883 kilowatt hours of electricity per capita. Another source says that each household consumed 7,100 kilowatt-hours annually in 2008.Bill Morris, What's the Greenest Place in America? Hint: It Has 8 Million People, AOL News, December 4, 2009 Retail sales in 2013 totalled 5.5 million MWh. =Retail industry structure= Vermont does not allow customers to shop for competitive energy suppliers. The state's sole investor owned utility, Green Mountain Power, serves about 80 percent of Vermont's customers. The remaining customers are served by two non-profit cooperative utilities and 14 municipal utilities. GMP became the state's largest power company through its merger with Central Vermont Public Service (CVPS) in 2012. =Cost (to consumer) = While Vermont paid the lowest rates in New England for power in 2007, it was still ranked among the highest eleven states in the nation; about 16 percent higher than the national average. In 2017, retail electric rates were $.17 per kwh, in direct contrast to rates in other states such as Delaware, where retail rates were $.07-.09 per kwh. In 2009, the state had the highest energy rates for energy (including heating) in the US and the worst affordability gap nationwide. The state's strategy to reduce costs focused on reliability, outages and maintenance, including the rollout of one of the best-connected smart grid infrastructures in the US, at a cost of $53 million, paid back entirely by such savings, starting in 2012. Increased economic activity due to reliable power and broadband was expected to further spread costs of maintenance of rural power networks across a larger tax base. Efficiency Vermont estimates that about $300/year in savings can be achieved simply by monitoring power use effectively via passive device replacements and by monitoring enabled by home automation or by smart meters. In the above comparison, if Vermont were to deregulate the electric market and allow outside electric suppliers to bid on providing energy, such as Delaware, a family who uses 1,000 kwh per month could see a 50% reduction in their bill, or $90 per month, or $1080 per year. This far surpasses the Efficiency Vermont target. The state has been aggressive in assisting persons exposed to peak pricing to identify waste and remove it, and focused on reduction of the overall energy bill rather than on reducing rates.  History  = James Bay = Vermont become embroiled in the controversy regarding James Bay hydroelectric developments by Hydro Quebec in the 1980s and 1990s. It was one of the customers that refused to buy imported power from Quebec until the James Bay Cree and Inuit had signed an agreement. By 2010 these issues were considered fully settled and a comprehensive agreement between Quebec and Vermont guaranteed the latter a reliable supply of hydroelectric power via the massive HQ transmission corridor. = Vermont Yankee = The Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, in Vernon. The Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant was commissioned in 1972. Vermont through the 2010s had the highest rate of nuclear-generated power in the nation, 73.7 percent. Vermont was also one of only two states with no coal-fired power plants, which nuclear proponents often cited as a reason to keep it open. Anti-nuclear political pressure ramped up after Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and especially the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March 2011. As of 2010, most of the energy was purchased wholesale for distribution from Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant and Hydro- Qu√©bec. The costs at Vermont Yankee were about 3 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In August 2013, Entergy announced that economic factors, notably the lower cost of electricity provided by competing natural gas-fired power plants, forced it to cease operations and schedule the decommissioning of the plant, which happened at the end of 2014.https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/12/29/vermont-nuclear-plant- shuts-down-today/uU0uUect2gVsVhvANHQVTO/story.html The plant closed eighteen years before its current operating license was set to expire on March 21, 2032.

Ghione was best known for writing, directing, and starring in the Za La Mort series of adventure films, in which Ghione played a likeable French Apache and 'honest outlaw'. Ghione directed, wrote, and acted in every genre of film, and directed some of the most famous stars of the time, including Francesca Bertini, Lina Cavalieri, Alberto Collo, and Hesperia. After his final film role in 1926, Ghione briefly performed on a theatrical tour of Italy. Ghione wrote three novels based around his Za La Mort character, an autobiography, and an essay on Italian Silent Cinema, before his death from tuberculosis in 1930. In 1979, a retrospective of Ghione's films was held at the Venice Film Festival. In 2008, a retrospective of his films was held at the Cinema Ritrovato festival in Bologna, and a temporary exhibition of photographs and film stills documenting Ghione's career was opened at the Cineteca of Bologna.  Film career =Early Life and film career= Born in Turin, Emilio Ghione was the son of a minor painter, Celestino Ghione, and initially worked as a painter of miniatures. Ghione secured work in Turin's growing film industry in 1908, initially as a set-hand and stuntman, performing dangerous stunts involving falling from horses.(Italian) Ghione, Emilio. (1928) Memorie e Confessioni. Milan: Cinemalia. Page 10. He began to play secondary roles in a variety of films, including the comedies of Andr√© Deed. Frustrated by the slow progress of his career, Ghione left Turin in 1911 to seek his fortune in Rome. =Rise to fame= In Rome, Ghione quickly progressed to starring roles in films made by Cines and Celio-Film, such as Il poverello di assisi (St Francis on its British release).The film is conserved at the British Film Institute, London. See: http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/336920 Ghione then starred in a series of films alongside Francesca Bertini and Alberto Collo, including Histoire d'un Pierrot. Ghione directed his first film as actor-director, Il Circolo Nero, in 1913. Ghione became known for his success in directing the demanding divas of the period, including Lina Cavalieri, Francesca Bertini and Hesperia. However, Ghione was not entirely able to resist their demands - Francesca Bertini allegedly ordered the destruction of all the prints of Don Pietro Caruso because she did not like the outfits she wore in the film.(Italian) Ghione, Emilio (1928) Memorie e Confessioni. Milan:Cinemalia. Page 70-71. =Za La Mort and height of fame= In 1914, Ghione created the first film featuring his character Za La Mort, Nelly La Gigolette, which was a great success.(Italian) Martinelli, Vittorio. (1995) Il cinema muto italiano. I film degli anni d'oro. 1914 volume 2. Turin/Rome: Rai/Eri. Pages 62-64 Following this success and his move to Tiber film, Ghione created a sequel called Za La Mort (1915), which developed the character and introduced a companion, Za La Vie, played by Kally Sambucini. Ghione created a total of thirteen Za La Mort feature films and three serial films between 1914 and 1924, many of which were very successful commercially.(Italian) Brunetta, Gian Piero (2008) Cent'anni di cinema italiano: 1. Dalle Origini alla Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Bari: Laterza. Pages 114-115 The character of Za La Mort, a Parisian apache, was unstable throughout the series. In some films, Za La Mort was a cruel-hearted, murderous, seductive criminal, while in others he was a romantic, faithful, underworld avenger, similar to Louis Feuillade's Judex.(Italian) Lotti, Denis (2008). Emilio Ghione, l'ultimo apache. Bologna: Edizioni della Cineteca di Bologna. Pages 158-160. The Za La Mort series was mostly set in an imaginary Paris, with some episodes set in America and exotic tropical locations. Despite inconsistencies of plot and character and mostly negative critical reviews, Za La Morts exotic, exciting adventures captured the public imagination and Ghione became one of the most recognisable stars of the Italian silent cinema.(Italian) Martinelli, Vittorio. (2007) Za La Mort. Bologna: Edizioni della Cineteca di Bologna. Page 26. During the production of the Za La Mort series, Ghione continued to star in and direct a variety of films, including melodramas, adventure films and a biopic of Italian patriot Guglielmo Oberdan. =Decline of film career and appearances in theatre= In the period 1919-1924, Ghione directed and starred in films for most of the major Italian film companies (including Lombardo (now known as Titanus) and other minor film companies. Ghione's decadent lifestyle and expensive habits left him nearly penniless when the Italian film industry collapsed in 1922.(Italian) Brunetta, Gian Piero (2008) Cent'anni di cinema: 1. Dalle origini alla Seconda Guerra Mondiale. Bari: Laterza. Page 114-115. In 1923, he left for Germany to make Zalamort ‚Äì Der Traum der Zalavie with Fern Andra, but the film was a commercial failure, owing partially to the fact that it was extensively cut by the censors.(Italian) Martinelli, Vittorio (2007) Za La Mort. Bologna: Edizioni Cineteca di Bologna. Page 110. Eventually, Ghione's own lack of funds and the commercial failure of several projects meant that he was no longer able to get the investment necessary to make his own film projects. Senza Padre (1924) was his last film as screenwriter, director and actor, and Ghione abandoned his last film project as a director, La Casa Errante, in 1927.Lotti, Denis (2008). Emilio Ghione, l'ultimo apache. Bologna: Edizioni Cineteca di Bologna. Page 29. Ghione then acted in several of the 'all-star' productions of 1925-1926, which failed to revive the dying Italian film industry.These included La via del peccato (1925) and Gli Ultimi Giorni di Pompei (1926), which is conserved at the British Film Institute, London. See: http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/55817 and http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/387103 In 1926, Ghione launched a theatrical revue with Kally Sambucini and Alberto Collo and toured Italy performing sketches based on the Za La Mort films.(Italian) Soro, Francesco. (1935) Splendore e miserie del cinema. Milan: Consalvo Editore. Page 175-178 Career as an author In 1922, Ghione's first Za La Mort novel, Le Maschere Bianche, was published in installments in the popular Al Cinema magazine.(Italian) Angelini, Antonella. (2007) Alle origini del Cineromanzo: note su ‚ÄúAl Cinema.‚Äù Published in Alovisio, Silvio (ed.) Cineromanzi. La Collezione del Museo Nazionale del Cinema. Turin: Museo Nazionale del Cinema. Page 51. Ghione's second novel, Za La Mort, was published in 1928.(Italian) Ghione, Emilio. (1928) Za La Mort. Florence: Nerbini. The novel was largely based on the Za La Mort films, especially on Zalamort ‚Äì Der Traum der Zalavie, the plot of which had been made almost unintelligible by censorship cuts. Ghione's autobiography, Memorie e Confessioni also appeared in the monthly cinema magazine Cinemalia between March and December 1928.Ghione, Emilio. (1928) Memorie e Confessioni. Milan: Cinemalia. During his time in Paris in 1929, Ghione wrote an essay on the history of Italian silent cinema La Parabole du Cin√©ma Italien (The Parabola of Italian Cinema). This essay was the first look at Italian silent cinema as a whole and was quoted extensively by the first film historians to deal with Italian silent cinema, such as Eugenio Palmieri. The essay was published in the French L'Art Cinematographique series in 1930 and in the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia in 1931.(French) Ghione, Emilio (1930) La Parabole du Cinema Italien. Published in Boisyvon, Andr√©, Ghione, Emilio and Pisani, Ferri. L'Art Cin√©matographique, volume 7. Paris: F√©lix Alcan. (Spanish) Grandeza y Decadenza del Cine Italiano. July 29‚Äì31, 1931.

The novel's central character is Ghione/Za La Mort, a mix of Ghione's decadent star persona and his favourite character, and tells of his adventures across the world and his encounters with beautiful women. The novel features extracts from Ghione's autobiography Memorie e Confessioni and minimises the character of Kally Sambucini/Za La Vie.(Italian) Ghione, Emilio. (1973) L'Ombra di Za La Mort. Brescia: Bietti. Personal life In 1911, Ghione married Clotilde Coletti and they had one son, Pierfrancesco Ghione, also known as Emilio Ghione Jr. The couple separated after 1913.(Italian) Lotti, Denis (2008). Emilio Ghione, l'ultimo apache. Bologna: Edizioni Cineteca di Bologna. Pages 24-24, 36. In 1915, Ghione started a relationship with Kally Sambucini, which lasted until his death. Ghione led a famously decadent life, following the trends set by poet Gabriele D'Annunzio. Ghione spent a lot of money on restaurants, generous tips, clothes and antiques.(Italian) Collo, Alberto. (16th July 1938) Vita patetica di Alberto Collo, il primo bello dello schermo Italiano. IV. Malinconico Tramonto del Fornaretto. Rome: Film (Settimanale di Cinematografo, Teatro e Radio). Ghione was a fan of luxury automobiles made by Lancia and used them in his films.(Italian) Buon compleanno Lancia via al Tour della centenaria. (April 06 2006). Rome: La Repubblica newspaper Page 62. See: http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/04/08/buon- compleanno-lancia-via-al-tour-della.html Illness and death Emilio Ghione was hospitalised following tuberculosis in 1927. A public appeal was opened for Ghione, and the money was used to help his recovery and send him to Paris in search of work. During his stay in Paris in 1929, Ghione slept rough and his health deteriorated. He was hospitalised in Paris and Lina Cavalieri paid to send him back to Turin by train. Emilio Ghione died on 7 January 1930 in Rome, in the presence of Kally Sambucini and his son, Pierfrancesco Ghione. His funeral was held at the Roman Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, and his remains interred in the Verano cemetery in Rome.

It consisted of what is today Upper Austria, parts of Southern Bohemia, and a small part of the Salzkammergut which was annexed from Styria.

His home Berghof was located in neighboring Gau Munich-Upper Bavaria. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. On 12 March 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria and on 24 May the Austrian provinces were reorganized and replaced by seven Nazi party Gaue.\\"Administration of Austria,\\" The Times (London) 25 May 1938, page 15. Under the Ostmarkgesetz law of 14 April 1939 with effect of 1 May, the Austrian Gaue were raised to the status of Reichsgaue and their Gauleiters were subsequently also named Reichsstatthalters. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War. Local Gauleiters were in charge of propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onwards, the Volkssturm and the defence of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in Upper Danube was held by August Eigruber for the duration of the existence of the Reichsgau. The Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp was located in the Reichsgau Oberdonau. Of the 199,404 prisoners that were sent to the camp 119,000 died in the harsh conditions of the camp through overwork, malnourishment and exhaustion.

It is a stone house erected during the 1870s in an eclectic Late Victorian architectural style from a design by Charles W. Clinton. It was listed on the Register in 1972. It is one of the few remaining buildings in Yonkers made of locally quarried greystone. Inside there is fine Eastlake cabinetry by the prominent Philadelphia cabinetmaker Daniel Pabst and other decorations and finishes; it is considered one of the finest interiors in that style in an American building open to the public. Financier John Bond Trevor built the house as a small country estate that was nevertheless close enough to New York City to allow him to commute to his job in the city by rail. At the time he and his family moved in, it was surrounded by similar houses. By the time Trevor's second wife died in the early 1920s, Glenview had become the center of a suburban neighborhood. The design of the house and the way the Trevors lived there epitomizes the transition between country living and the modern suburb. In 1929, after the Trevor family had moved out, the house became home to the Hudson River Museum for the next 45 years. The museum has since expanded but the house remains part of the complex. Its rooms have been refurbished in the style of the period, and are open to visitors. Renovations in the early 21st century have better integrated the house with the rest of the museum. Building The house itself is a 2¬Ω-story building, four bays on the south and east elevation, five on the west and three on the north. Its load-bearing walls are built of locally quarried greystone, laid in rough-hewn blocks, with Ohio sandstone ornamentation. Four projections supplement its rectangular form, the most prominent being a rectangular tower on the south (front) facade topped by a steep pyramidal roof. It is echoed by a smaller conical-roofed tower on the west face. There is a small front porch on the south and a rear stoop. Bay windows are on the south and west. Atop is a hipped roof surfaced in composition shingles. At various locations it is pierced by ten dormer windows, some of them nested within gables. Several small brick chimneys, no longer functional, pierce the flat top of the roof near the northwest corner. Sitting room and library, as photographed by alt=A black and white photograph of a well-decorated room with a globed hanging light fixture. On the left is an entryway to a neighboring room, similarly decorated On the facades, sandstone courses run along the lintel and sill lines. The first story windows are topped with ornate lintels; small rosettes are in the stonework above the second story's sandstone course. At the roofline is a broad overhanging cornice with dentils and voluted brackets. Above the cornice on the south facade bay window is a balcony with wooden balustrade, echoed on the tower. The front porch has a hipped roof supported by two turned wooden columns with balustrades between themselves and the front wall. The main hall features carved ebony columns in the Eastlake style with a floor of alternating majolica and encaustic tiles. They are complemented by stenciled ceilings, elaborate wooden door enframements and paintings and sculptures. In the sitting room the woodwork includes inlaid sunflower detailing and birdseye maple cabinetry. The parlors have Meissen china figure groups and an Italian marble statue of Faust and Marguerite. History There are three eras in Glenview's history: the time leading up to its construction, the Trevors' residence, and the years since then that it has been used as a museum. alt=A black-and-white image of a man with thinning hair, mustache and beard wearing a suit and vest, shown from the chest up =1861‚Äì1876: Background and construction= Philadelphia native John Bond Trevor, son of former Pennsylvania State Treasurer John B. Trevor, came to work on Wall Street in the 1850s. His career as a banker and stockbroker went well enough for him to move to Yonkers when he married in 1861. At the time the community was becoming attractive as a residence for wealthy financiers who wanted to live on Hudson Valley estates yet remain within commuting distance of their jobs in Manhattan via rail‚Äîthe beginnings of suburbanization. Upon first moving to Northwest Yonkers, the Trevors lived at a house on the northwest corner of Glenwood and Ravine avenues, near where the Glenwood train station is today. James B. Colgate, Trevor's business partner, owned the land. There were few other neighbors, as most of the land between Warburton and North Broadway was open and undeveloped, making it attractive to Trevor and businessmen like him. In 1867 his wife died. After remarrying, he bought the to the north for $150,000 ($ in modern dollars) and commissioned Charles W. Clinton, an architect with offices near his in what is today Lower Manhattan, to design a house. Clinton, who had worked under Richard Upjohn earlier in his career, produced a building described even at the time as \\"not strictly confined to any one style.\\" For the interior finishes he hired some of the accomplished craftsmen of the age, particularly Philadelphia cabinetmaker Daniel Pabst, whose work Trevor or Clinton may have seen at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where he won an award for a sideboard. Local builders, some of whom had also attended the exposition, where the newest construction techniques and materials had been exhibited and demonstrated,Vookles, 149. handled the framing, plumbing and painting. The carpet came from the nearby Alexander Smith Carpet Mills.Vookles, 155. The house was finished in 1877. alt=A black-and-white engraving showing the house amid a natural setting of trees and hills Before building the house, Trevor, who had acquired an interest in horticulture upon his move to Yonkers, developed greenhouses and stables. His choice of land differs from that of most estates in Yonkers at the time, such as his friends the Shonnards to the north, which were built higher up the hill with all the land straight down to the river, rather than at its edge, where the railroad cut off direct river access and passing trains occasionally spoiled the view and created a fire hazard. Trevor's theoretical second parcel just offshore could have been developed, but again the railroad's presence made that unlikely. He may have preferred to remain near his partner, the station and the facilities he had already built. Indeed, he put the property's gates on Ravine to the south, rather than Warburton, which was closest to the house but unpaved, since Ravine was a short distance from the station.Vookles, 142. Trevor had been active in the community, serving as a presidential elector and chairing meetings of the local Republican Party.Vookles, 144. Therefore, the house attracted much notice in the local newspapers, as one of the first large houses built in the area since the Panic of 1873 had depressed the economy.Vookles, 146. It was called a \\"showplace\\" for Yonkers, incorporated as a city just five years earlier, in 1872. In 1886 it was one of 12 Yonkers homes selected for engraved illustrations in Thomas Scharf's History of Westchester County, which has since become a standard reference work for historians.Vookles, 138. =1876‚Äì1922: As residence= Throughout those years, Trevor lived the life of a gentleman farmer, commuting to Wall Street daily. The family wintered in the city, and sometimes went to the Catskills during the hot stretches of the summer.Vookles, 160. He was close friends with neighbors like Samuel J. Tilden, formerly governor of New York and Democratic candidate for president in the controversial 1876 election, lawyer William Allen Butler and rail magnate Colgate Hoyt. Guests at Glenview included Civil War generals Nelson Miles and William Tecumseh Sherman, who suggested the eventual renaming of the Trevors' former residence, Edgewater, to Seven Pines after the battle.Vookles, 158. John B. Trevor, Sr., Trevor's youngest son, recalls the times of his childhood at Glenview as a \\"paradise.\\" He and Colgate Hoyt's son Sherman, his only neighbor around his age, often played together with the Wiffler sons and his older half-brother. The nearby river played a prominent role in their play. Henry Trevor joined the Yonkers Yacht Club, where he and other members raced as far upriver as Rondout Creek, at Kingston. In the 1890s John and his sisters began to take up golf, another new pastime of the Gilded Age rich. They all took up bicycling as well, and one of the sisters, Emily, became an avid bicyclist as well, once riding as far away as Hastings-on-Hudson and Riverdale.Vookles, 160‚Äì62. John Bond Trevor died in 1890, with John Wiffler, the gardener he had collaborated with on the property, retiring two years later to open a feed store in downtown Yonkers. The family continued to live in Glenview. Mary Trevor's wedding reception there in 1892 was widely covered by both the local and New York newspapers. A special train brought guests from the city to the ceremony at St. John's Episcopal Church downtown and back from the mansion. The flowers came from the estate's greenhouses. Trevor's widow continued to live at Glenview with her children as they grew up. Her daughter Emily kept a diary which provides most of what is known about Glenview as the 19th century became the 20th. She attended boarding school in the city but returned for holidays and vacations. Her reminiscences are often of visiting friends or family, and trips to New York City or, as she referred to it, the village of Yonkers, then a mile (1.6 km) away. During the first decade of the new century these trips started to be taken by car instead of the train or carriage. This reflected not only the increasing use of the automobile but the New York Central Railroad's electrification project for the line, which not only disrupted service but required the building of the large power plant that, now unused, still sits on the river shoreline near the current Glenwood station, which still uses the 1911 station building.Vookles, 162‚Äì63. After his wedding in 1909, John moved out while his mother and sister remained at the house. He visited frequently enough with his own children, particularly in the summertime, to be described as a resident in his mother's obituary in 1922. His son John B. Trevor, Jr., recalled in the last years of his own life that by that point, the billiards room was used primarily as the children's dining room, with the billiards table covered with a tablecloth. The parlor and library were rarely used. Emily said later that she and her aging mother \\"lived a very quiet life\\" at Glenview during the 1910s.Vookles, 164. The neighborhood around them had changed considerably since the house was built. Back in 1875, the year before Glenview's construction began, the Shonnards had subdivided their property to the north and east of the estate. In the years since, those lots had been sold and slowly developed with houses similar to, but smaller than, Glenview. Often their proximity to the Trevors' home was used as a selling point. By the time of Emily Trevor's death, this evolution from country town to modern suburb was almost complete, and so the family decided to sell the house as none of them wanted to live there anymore due to those changes.Vookles, 165. =1922‚Äìpresent: As museum= The city of Yonkers bought the house and grounds from the family with the intent of using the land as a public park. Trevor Park was established soon afterwards. The house stood vacant for six years until it was opened as the Museum of Science and Art, with the collection established at Yonkers City Hall in 1919 for future historical use. In 1948 it became the Hudson River Museum, renting the house and the land from the city for $1 a year. During these years, the exterior was altered somewhat by the removal of the porte-coch√®re and verandas. Inside, the mantelpieces were removed. The front door's transom was taken out so that a stuffed elephant from the Barnum & Bailey Circus could be brought in. The rooms were used as exhibit halls and their finishings neglected. alt=The house with a grey concrete barrier in front of it. To the right is a large square white arch. Behind it is a glass entrance with \\"Hudson River Museum\\" written on its right in light gray type. In 1967 the museum decided it needed more space and commissioned a $1.5 million ($ in modern dollars), addition with a planetarium in the brutalist style popular at the time. It was completed two years later. In addition to being a stark contrast to the house, it enclosed it within a courtyard, restricting the view of its first story. The front entrance, with barred doors, was later compared to a prison. An elevator was installed in the mansion and its rooms were restored to focus on the house's history and how the Trevors lived. Three decades later, in the first years of the 21st century, the museum began raising money to upgrade both of its facilities as part of a $14 million expansion. The first phases called for better integrating and connecting Glenview and the 1969 structure. A breezeway between the two was enclosed, and a corridor was built between the facilities to connect to a planned new elevator on the outside. The changes, the museum's director explained, were necessary to comply with federal accessibility laws yet preserve the building's historic character. Aesthetics Trevor and Clinton had worked together closely and put considerable thought into the design of the house, since Trevor designed the surrounding landscaping and wanted it to be compatible. Windows were carefully situated for how they framed the view of the river and landscape. Clinton's stylistic choices were truly eclectic. One of Yonkers's newspapers described the house as old English in style while the other said it \\"par[took] rather of the French ch√¢teau character.\\" The rough-hewn stone facing echoes the nearby Greystone and Rosemont mansions, which Trevor may have commended to the architect as examples since Clinton had up to then primarily designed urban houses. Greystone's tower may have inspired the one Clinton built on the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in Manhattan a year after Glenview was finished.Vookles, 150. The inside reflected changes in house design that would later become common in suburban residences. In an urban house, rooms would have been stretched out to the back along the floor due to spatial limitations on the sides. As a result, the dining room and kitchen were in the rear since they could be on the same floor. A pantry connected them so service need not go through the public areas of the house.Vookles, 151. In Glenview, the parlor and billiards room were on the east of the great entrance hall, while the library and other rooms more used by the family than visitors were on the west to allow them to enjoy the river view. Between the dining room and library was the sitting room, opening onto the large veranda, called a \\"piazza\\" at the time, that was originally attached to that side of the house. Another wide veranda, with a porte-coch√®re, was originally attached to the south as well. In addition to allowing views of the river on warm evenings, the verandas also helped cool the house. They insulated the adjacent sections of the house, and allowed for an intermediate area between the less-ventilated house and the unshaded outdoors on hot days. They and the other areas of the first floor were amply furnished with reclining chairs and rockers, reflecting the construction of the house with leisure in mind. On the second story, the master bedroom occupied the southwest corner, not only to take in the river but to take advantage of the southern exposure, difficult to get in many Manhattan houses.Vookles, 152. Since his move to Yonkers, Trevor had worked with gardener John Wiffler on the property. Once Glenview had been built, Wiffler moved in with his family to the superintendent's cottage. The two planted 200 evergreens around the house and grounds, and orange and lemon trees in front. Trevor threw himself quite passionately into his hobby, growing prize specimens and developing new breeds. In 1883 the estate's Black Hamburg grapes won first premium at the autumn meeting of the New York Horticulture Society. His grandson recalled later that the potting shed was \\"simply lined with awards\\" for the flowers, and his copper-colored \\"Glenview mum\\" was sold in Manhattan.Vookles, 156. Neighborhood The house is located on the grounds of the Hudson River Museum, just north of its poured concrete brutalist main building. It forms the north wall of the building's central courtyard. The entire complex is on the west side of Warburton just north of Trevor Park and south of John F. Kennedy Memorial Drive, which curves to the west of the museum as well. The ground slopes steadily westward to the tracks of the Metro-North Hudson Line 300 feet (100 m) to the west, along the shore of the Hudson River. Metro-North's Glenwood station is a thousand feet (300 m) to the south along the line. Across the river there is a view of the stone cliffs of the Palisades in New Jersey. Across Warburton to the east are two- story 20th-century houses. Behind them runs the Old Croton Aqueduct, a National Historic Landmark, and its trailway. A modern high-rise building is to the west across Memorial Drive. A small parking lot, for museum employees, is to the immediate north. On the south, Trevor Park is a mostly open area, with the museum's entrance road on the east, two baseball diamonds and tennis courts. To its south are more modern high-rise apartment buildings.

It existed between 1938 and 1945. Parts of Lower Austria were annexed to establish Greater Vienna, which then became the biggest city of Nazi Germany by area. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. On 12 March 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria and on 24 May the Austrian provinces were reorganized and replaced by seven Nazi party Gaue.\\"Administration of Austria,\\" The Times (London) 25 May 1938, page 15. Under the Ostmarkgesetz law of 14 April 1939 with effect of 1 May, the Austrian Gaue were raised to the status of Reichsgaue and their Gauleiters were subsequently also named Reichsstatthalters. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War. Local Gauleiters were in charge of propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onwards, the Volkssturm and the defence of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in Vienna was initially held by Odilo Globoƒçnik from 24 May 1938 to 30 January 1939, by Josef B√ºrckel to 2 August 1940 and by Baldur von Schirach for the remainder of the Reichsgau's history up to 8 May 1945.

Kohler founded what later became known as the Kohler Company, a large producer of bathroom and kitchen products. Early life Kohler was born on November 3, 1844 in the Alpine village of Schnepfau, Austria, the fourth child of dairy farmer John Michael Kohler Sr. (1805‚Äì74) and his wife, the former Maria Anna Moosbrugger (1816‚Äì53). After his wife's death, the elder Kohler remarried, and he and his large family emigrated to the United States. With help from a relative, the Kohlers built up a promising dairy business. After a limited formal education, John Michael Kohler found work in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1865 he moved to Chicago, Illinois, and became a traveling salesman. In Sheboygan, Wisconsin, 56 miles north of Milwaukee on Lake Michigan, he met Lillie Vollrath (1848‚Äì1883), the daughter of local steel and iron industrialist Jacob Vollrath (1824‚Äì1898). The couple was married in 1871. Business career Shortly after his marriage, Kohler worked at the steel and iron factory his father-in-law partly owned. He took over the company two years later during the Panic of 1873. By the early 1880s, the firm was producing a variety of iron and enamelware products. In 1883, Kohler put ornamental feet on a cast-iron water trough and sold it as a bathtub. Four years later, more than two-thirds of the company's business was in plumbing products and enamelware. In 1888, Kohler and two partners had the firm incorporated. In 1899, Kohler purchased 21 acres of farmland four miles west of Sheboygan, intending to move his entire company to the location. Shortly after the new factory was constructed, in 1900, Kohler died at 56, likely of heart failure. Five years later, 30-year-old Walter J. Kohler assumed his father's corporate presidency and began to guide the firm. In 1912, it was officially designated the Kohler Company, and the property surrounding the plant became the Village of Kohler. Civic leadership From 1880 until his death Kohler served in several governmental offices. In 1892 he became Mayor. Citizens also admired Kohler for his generous contributions and leadership in the areas of art and culture, symbols of Sheboygan's desire to be more than a factory town.Thomas C. Reeves, Distinguished Service: The Life of Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler, Jr. (Marquette University Press, 2006), pp. 19-29 The John Michael Kohler Arts Center, which occupies a square block in downtown Sheboygan (containing Kohler's restored Gilded Age home along with modern buildings), is named for Kohler,Richard E. Blodgett, A Sense of Higher Design: The Kohlers of Kohler (Greenwich Publishing Group, 2003)http://www.akohlerexperience.com/village/tours/art_center as is John Michael Kohler State Park, established on land donated in 1966 by the Kohler family. The main highway into Sheboygan, Kohler Memorial Drive (which is routed as Wisconsin Highway 23), is also named for Kohler. Personal life The Kohlers had six children, including Walter Jodok Kohler, Sr. (1875-40), who would later be Governor of Wisconsin. In 1887, four years after his wife Lillie's death, John married Lillie's sister, Wilhelmina (Minnie) Vollrath (1852‚Äì1929), and they had one child, Herbert Vollrath Kohler Sr (1891‚Äì1968). This Kohler was to become the dominant force in the Kohler company for many years, presiding over the longest strike in American history. The large and fashionable Kohler family home in Sheboygan was filled with music, books, and constant lessons in ethics and public service. The entire Sheboygan area mourned Kohler's 1900 death. John's three daughters remained in the Kohler house, unmarried, for the rest of their lives, frequently wearing black.  References  External links *Brief biography of Jacob J.

History In 1997 Brennan Gilmore of Lexington, Virginia gathered together musicians from his hometown and from the University of Virginia, where he was studying international relations, to create the band Walker's Run.\\"Walker's Run fans have a treat in store\\" in Charlottesville Daily Progress, November 02, 2007. The group combined Rockbridge County mountain-music, Blue Ridge bluegrass, and the Indie Rock experience of Gilmore's high school band, Concordia Discors. They packed major Charlottesville venues such as The Starr Hill Music Hall while becoming regulars at smaller venues like Millers and Michael's Bistro. Their repertoire included new takes on the \\"old time\\" canon, an eclectic group of covers and crowd favorites along with original songs. The Walker's Run sound is best defined by compositions like \\"Torrent\\" by songwriter Gilmore. The band sold thousands of copies of their eponymous debut CD Walker's Run before taking a long-term hiatus in 2002 when their founder began his professional career as a United States Foreign Service Officer which takes him to long-term posts abroad.Walker's Run Official Website Biography. During Gilmore's stateside posts, the band reunites and invites new fans to local shows. In the interim band members have continued separate musical careers, including collaborations with Sub-Saharan and North African musicians and reggae fusion to producing bluegrass records.

This form of injury is rare in normal civilian practice, but are common following a natural disaster. Other causes include industrial accidents, road traffic collisions, building collapse, accidents involving heavy plant, disaster relief or terrorist incidents. Presentation = Complications = * Hypovolaemic Shock. Loss of plasma volume across damaged cell membranes and capillary walls can lead directly to severe hypovolaemia. Furthermore, shock can develop from myocardial depression following release of intracellular electrolytes. In addition, as a result of the mechanism of injury, blood loss from pelvic or long bone fractures may also co-exist. * Hyperkalaemia and electrolyte imbalance. Disruption of cell membranes can result in a significant release of potassium, which is a largely intracellular cation that can precipitate cardiac arrest. Sequestration of plasma calcium into injured tissue can lead to a relative hypocalcaemia, which may worsen disruption of clotting abilities and shock. Metabolic acidosis may result from reperfusion injury and hypoperfusion related to shock. * Compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome is a common complication of crush injury as a consequence of oedematous tissue injury, redistribution of fluid into the intracellular compartment and bleeding. Established compartment syndrome may result in worsened systemic crush syndrome and irreversible muscle cell death. * Acute Kidney Injury. Release of myoglobin by injured muscle leads to rhabdomyolysis coupled with shock leads to a significant rate of acute kidney injury, estimated as up to 15%. Acute kidney injury leads to a significantly higher mortality.  Pathophysiology  Crush injury is damage to the body as a result of being crushed by an object. Crush syndrome is a systemic result of skeletal muscle injury and breakdown and subsequent release of cell contents. The severity of crush syndrome is dependent on the duration and magnitude of the crush injury as well as the bulk of muscle affected. It can result from both short duration, high-magnitude injuries (such as being crushed by a building) or from low magnitude, long-duration injuries such as coma or drug induced immobility.  Treatment  Early fluid resuscitation reduces the risk of kidney failure, reduces the severity of hyperkalaemia and may improve outcomes in isolated crush injury. For casualties with isolated crush injury who are haemodynamically stable, large volume crystalloid fluid resuscitation reduces the severity of and reduces the risk of acute kidney injury.

On June 22, 2000, the Wuhan Airlines Xian Y-7, registration B-3479, flying the route crashed after encountering an area of adverse weather; the aircraft was struck by lightning and encountered windshear. Immediately after the accident, China ordered all of Wuhan Airlines' Xian Y-7 aircraft be grounded. One month after the accident, they were allowed to resume service. The cause was determined to be the adverse weather the aircraft encountered, specifically the lightning strike. The accident remains the deadliest involving a Xian Y-7 aircraft, and is today the 12th deadliest aviation accident in the history of China. History The Wuhan Airlines Xian Y-7 aircraft departed Enshi Airport, on June 22, 2000, for a flight to Wuhan Wangjiadun Airport. As the aircraft approached Wuhan, the flight crew were informed of adverse weather conditions in the area of the airport. The flight crew circled the airport for approximately 30 minutes, waiting for the weather to improve; during this time they debated whether to divert to another airport, but the pilot decided to continue to try and land at Wuhan. Weather stations recorded 451 thunderclaps in ten minutes during the 30 minute period the aircraft was circling above the airport. At approximately 15:00 local time, the aircraft was impacted by windshear and struck by lightning, before it crashed in Sitai Village, Yongfeng Township. The fuselage came down between and from Wuhan in two sections; half of the aircraft fell on a dike on the Han River, the other half impacted with a farmhouse. All 40 passengers and four crew were killed, along with seven people on the ground. Grounding of Xian Y-7 aircraft In the aftermath of the accident, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) ordered all Wuhan Airlines' six other Xian Y-7 aircraft be grounded until the cause of the crash was determined. In July they were permitted to return to service after safety inspections were carried out and flight crews received more training. The CAAC ordered all Xian Y-7 aircraft be removed from scheduled passenger service by June 1, 2001. Cause The cause was determined to be the adverse weather the aircraft encountered, specifically the lightning strike.

The company supplies electricity for more than 95% of Munich's 750.000 households as well as natural gas, drinking water and, through its stake in the M-net Telekommunikations GmbH, telecommunications services. SWM is Europe's largest municipal utility company and ranks among Germany's principal energy providers according to company information. Expanding use of renewable energy has been a central element in the company's strategy since 2008. However, the company is also engaged in the industrialisation of the Norwegian wilderness through massive wind-turbines, which has created great opposition in Norway, among others in S√∏rmarka, Tr√∏ndelag. Through its subsidiary, the M√ºnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH (MVG) (founded in 2001), the SWM also runs most of the inner city public transportation network by maintaining the Munich U-Bahn as well as the Munich Tramway and bus services.  Products  =Electricity= Under the \\"M-Strom\\" name, SWM offers various electricity rates and related services for private and business customers in Munich and the surrounding region. Many offers are available nationwide. With more than 250,000 green energy customers, SWM refers to itself as one of the largest providers of green electricity in the private and commercial market in Germany. Within Munich city limits and the surrounding region, SWM operates twelve hydroelectric power plants, several plants which generate electricity from renewable energy, and the three cogeneration power plants Nord, S√ºd and Freimann, which generate around 70 percent of the electricity through cogeneration. =Natural gas= SWM supplies its customers with natural gas as part of the trans-European network. The company is also able to draw on its own underground storage. SWM offers various natural gas rates, some of which are available nationwide. In Munich, SWM operates ten natural gas stations where cars can fill up on renewable bio- methane. =District heating= When generating electricity in the cogeneration process, heat is created which is then inputted into the district heating grid from SWM's cogeneration plants. SWM produces district heating in its cogeneration and heating plants which supplies large buildings and households via over 800 kilometers of steam and hot water networks, which is then in turn used for heating and the supply of hot water. Thanks to wide- ranging investments in this area, connecting to the SWM district heating network is now possible in an increasing number of districts in Munich. By 2040, the aim is to produce 100 percent of district heating in Munich using renewable energies. =District cooling= Compared to conventional air conditioning systems, district cooling has less of an environmental impact and is more energy efficient ‚Äì in fact, district cooling requires around half of the primary energy required by air conditioning. Cold ground water is used as the energy source for cooling within a closed loop system, and only the pumps are operated using electricity. The slightly warmed groundwater is then subsequently returned to the groundwater system. =Water= Some 80 percent of the drinking water for Munich comes from the Mangfalltal valley near Weyarn in Upper Bavaria, while 20 percent is sourced from the Loisachtal valley near Garmisch-Partenkirchen, between Oberau and Farchant. The southern area of the Munich gravel plain also serves as a reserve for peaks in demand. The high quality of the city's drinking water is, among other things, attributable to these procurement areas in the Bavarian Alpine foothills, as well as the sustainable forestry in these regions. =Swimming pools= SWM operates ten indoor and eight outdoor swimming pools in Munich. The company's operations in this area deliver on the ‚ÄúMunich swimming pool concept‚Äù adopted by the city council in 1991, which provided for the improvement of the city's swimming pools for leisure and recreation. In Munich, there are two combined pool complexes (combination of indoor and outdoor pools): the Westbad in Weinbergerstrasse in the west and the Michaelibad in Heinrich-Wieland-Strasse in the east. The Michaelibad is Munich's largest recreation and leisure pool complex. =Energy advice= The offer range also includes the energy saving advice project for low-income households, which SWM carries out together with Munich-based charities.  Renewable energies project  In 2008, SWM initiated an offensive for expanding the use of renewable energies. By 2025, SWM is aiming to produce as much green electricity with its own plants as consumed by the whole of Munich ‚Äì some 7.5 billion kilowatt hours per year. The renewable energies expansion offensive has a budget of around nine billion euros. Currently, SWM holds a stake in the offshore wind parks Global Tech I, Gwynt y M√¥r and DanTysk, among others. Further projects like the offshore wind park Sandbank are currently in the planning phase.  Public transport  M√ºnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH (MVG), a subsidiary of SWM, offers a range of public transport in Munich, including subway, bus and tram.  Telecommunications  Together with its subsidiary M-net Telekommunikations GmbH, SWM is laying a fiber-optic network in Munich. Moreover, M-net is investing in the expansion of fiber-optic broadband networks in other regions of Bavaria. These are already available in over 50 percent of Bavarian households as well as for private and business customers in the Greater Ulm region.  Group structure  Stadtwerke M√ºnchen has been a GmbH since 1998, i.e. a private law-governed limited company, which is wholly owned by the City of Munich. As a municipal company, SWM provides public services. SWM's headquarters is in the north of Munich, in Emmy-Noether-Strasse 2.

As a musician and bandleader he has originated and performed in a number of musical groups. He was raised in Lexington, Virginia and attended the University of Virginia, studying international relations as an Echols Scholar, graduating in 2001. He currently resides in Charlottesville, Virginia. Gilmore served as chief of staff for Tom Perriello's campaign for governor in Virginia. He currently serves as senior director for Clean Virginia, and works in rural workforce development, bringing IT opportunities to \\"underserved communities\\" in rural Virginia. He teaches as adjunct faculty at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Gilmore was present for a protest rally in Charlottesville on August 12, 2017 that turned violent. His film of a car ramming participants led to accusations and threats, damages for some of which he is now suing in court. Diplomatic career Gilmore joined the United States Foreign Service in 2002, shortly after finishing college, serving 15 years in several African countries, including Tunisia. He also served at postings in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Sudan, and Sierra Leone ‚Äî and domestically from the State Department in Washington, D.C. He was Deputy Chief of Mission in Central African Republic. His service in Africa was curtailed by a closing of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Bangui in 2012 due to security concerns. Gilmore served as Russ Feingold and Tom Perriello's top aide in their postings as U.S. Special Envoy to the African Great Lakes Region. He is currently on long-term unpaid leave from the Department of State. Political activism Brennan Gilmore's grandfather, John Middlemas, a 97-year-old World War II veteran, \\"took a knee\\" in support of NFL players protesting the national anthem, saying, \\"Those kids have every right to protest.\\" Gilmore \\"knew it was a powerful image\\" of his relative kneeling, and posted it to his Twitter account. His grandfather's activism was inspired by his own New Zealand relative, a British settler \\"who spoke out against 'mean and nasty' treatment of the Maori 150 years ago.\\" Gilmore's aunt Maile Auterson, who heads a community gardens organization in Missouri and descends from a long line of Ozarks farmers, claims \\"they are a family of Democrats\\". Gilmore served as chief of staff for Tom Perriello's Democratic campaign for Virginia governor in 2017 and formed a musical group from his friends known as Perriello's Pickers to help get the political message across. His latest group, Wild Common, echoes a poem by D. H. Lawrence titled \\"The Wild Common\\" which laments the loss of natural environment: Gilmore has been an outspoken critic of Dominion Energy. He current serves as a senior director of Clean Virginia, an organization established to limit the influence of monopoly energy utility Dominion Energy in Virginia politics. As Gilmore stated about legislation Dominion sponsored, \\"these are convenient ways to open the door to deregulation and overcharging the customer.\\" He has also opposed two natural gas pipelines proposed for Virginia, performing with his group Wild Common at a protest event to block them, stating: In his role at Wize Solutions, he promotes rural workforce development in the southwest region of Virginia. The college course Gilmore teaches at James Madison University as adjunct faculty, \\"Political Protest and Civil Engagement\\", looks at the role of protests in a democracy. His attendance at the \\"Unite the Right\\" rally in Charlottesville on August 12, 2017 was motivated by his desire to counter the evil he saw gathering there. As he explained to Judy Woodruff in an interview on PBS: Charlottesville rally Gilmore was present at the protest rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017, where he filmed the automobile ramming participants. He subsequently was the target of accusations and threats regarding his role in the incident. Gilmore says threats came in on Twitter and Facebook like: \\"You're a dead man walking. You're a CIA operative. You work for George Soros or Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton ... we're coming for you. We know where you are.\\" In an interview with NPR, Gilmore stated: Gilmore and his family have suffered other consequences. Gilmore is now pursuing damages from media outlets in court. The complaint, filed March 13, 2018 by Georgetown Law's Civil Rights Clinic on behalf of Gilmore, names Alex Jones of InfoWars, Lee Stranahan formerly of Breitbart News, and former Florida congressman Allen West as defendants, along with Jim Hoft of The Gateway Pundit. It was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia Charlottesville Division. In a statement, Gilmore said of the defendants named in his suit: The controversy also affected Gilmore's relationship with musicians he admired. As he describes it, \\"People really distanced themselves from me and even condemned me that I grew up playing music with.\\" Musician career Growing up in Lexington, Gilmore benefited from, and was influenced by the many other established musicians in the area, including Will Lee, Larry Keel, Mike Seeger, and Gary and Rooster Ruley. He is a multi-instrumentalist ‚Äî performing on guitar, mandolin, banjo, and violin ‚Äî and singer, who often provides lead vocals. Since forming Concordia Discors (\\"harmony of discordant elements\\") in high school, he has originated a number musical groups (while performing in others). As a songwriter, Foreign service assignments to Africa \\"have provided plenty of inspiration\\" for his original tunes. His \\"Kakuma\\" released in 2008 \\"delivers a chilling tale of a conflict zone in Sudan from a Blue Ridge front porch.\\" As Gilmore states: =Walker's Run= In 1997 Gilmore of Lexington, Virginia gathered musicians from his hometown and from the University of Virginia to create the band Walker's Run, which \\"built a loyal regional following for its high-energy hoedowns.\\" Musically the group combined Rockbridge County mountain music, Blue Ridge bluegrass, and the indie rock experience of Gilmore's high school band. In the newgrass vein, Walker's Run performs traditional bluegrass material in a hard- charging style, pushing the edges into other genres such as jazz, blues, reggae, and even rock. As Gilmore states, \\"There's a roughness to the music. Our sound is more raw mountain music than cleaner traditional bluegrass.\\" They often perform Gilmore originals mixed with bluegrass covers of Beatles tunes and those by reggae star Bob Marley. The group stopped playing full-time in 2002 when Gilmore joined the Foreign Service, coming together for \\"sporadic\\" reunions since. They released a six-song EP titled Live at Lime Kiln from a summer performance at \\"the idyllic outdoor theater in Lexington\\" in 2008 ‚Äî their first recording since 2000. =Kantara= After serving in Africa with the U.S. Foreign Service, Gilmore created the musical group Kantara, an Arab- Appalachian collaboration that earned him an award from the U.S. Secretary of State for its cultural impact. As Gilmore states: \\"A couple of old fiddle tunes have now become oud and darbouka tunes.\\" Kantara means \\"bridge\\" in Arabic. Joining him in this project were other members of Walker's Run, including violinist Ann Marie Calhoun. =Borden Grant= Gilmore started \\"alt-country-soul band\\" Borden Grant, named for the provision of land by King George II of Great Britain on which Rockbridge County, Virginia was later situated,BORDEN Ancestral Line from COWAN Connections, 1994, pp. 374‚Äì380 by Michael S.

The group fuses \\"melodic rock, traditional Scots- Irish ballads, and Stax/Volt soul.\\" =Wild Common= Gilmore's new group, Wild Common, appeared at the \\"Water is Life Rally & Concert\\" in Richmond, Virginia on December 2, 2017. The group earlier performed at a \\"welcoming Obama to Virginia\\" rally ‚Äî where the 44th U.S. president spoke in support of Democrat Ralph Northam in \\"Virginia's high-stakes gubernatorial election\\" on October 19, 2017 (also in Richmond). Tom Perriello, whose campaign for Virginia governor Gilmore served on, expressed excitement at attending the February 17, 2018 Charlottesville debut of the \\"genre-defying New Appalachian band\\" with his \\"old bus-ride seat mate\\" Davina Jackson as lead vocalist. In addition to Gilmore on guitar and vocals, the group features: Davina Jackson (vocals), Nate Leath (fiddle), Dhara Goradia (bass), and Rob Hubbard (drums/percussion). While serving as chief of staff for Tom Perriello's gubernatorial campaign in 2017, Gilmore formed the Perriello Pickers, a bluegrass band which included musicians from Walker's Run, e.g., Nate Leath on violin, Will Lee on banjo, Andy Thacker on mandolin, and Zack Blatter on bass. Jay Starling, son of The Seldom Scene founder John Starling, played \\"dobro banjo\\" and Gilmore himself played guitar.

Several species are well-known honeybee mimics, such as the drone fly Eristalis tenax, while other genera such as Helophilus and Parhelophilus exhibit wasp-like patterns of yellow and black stripes, both strategies to avoid predation by visual predators such as birds. They breed in decaying organic materials such as run-offs from dung heaps (Eristalis) or in ponds and ditches (e.g. Anasimyia). Some others, such as Myathropa and Mallota, breed in wet rotting tree stumps and rot holes. A characteristic feature of this tribe is the \\"rat-tailed maggot\\" with a rear positioned telescopic breathing tube, allowing the larvae to breathe while living submerged in water or mud.

Only two prototypes were built and the type did not enter production. Design and development The Bernard 82 was developed from the long-range Bernard 80 GR, which had been designed to set long-distance-flight records. The all-metal Bernard 82 was a three-seat long-range bomber, known at the time as a bombardier de represaillies or reprisal bomber. The cantilever mid-wing monoplane was powered by an Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs inline piston engine. The first prototype flew from Le Bourget on 11 December 1933, and in March 1932 was joined by the second prototype. Flight testing showed the twin lateral radiators to be inadequate; they were replaced by front-mounted radiators. Landing-gear deficiencies were the most persistent difficulty encountered during testing. The retractable landing gear regularly failed; resulting in wheels-up landings. The problem was never resolved, and testing was halted in mid-1935; the production contract for ten aircraft was cancelled. In August 1936 the second prototype was re-engined with a CLM Lille 6As, a licence-built Jumo 205 diesel engine. The diesel-powered aircraft, redesignated Bernard 86, was entered into the 1936 Paris-Saigon-Paris air race. The race was run in September, but the Bernard was not ready by then, so it was not used. There were no further flight tests; the units were scrapped.

It was incorporated on July 20, 1901 and was owned by the Itasca Lumber Company. Less than two weeks after its inception, the railway purchased the property of the Itasca Railroad. The 1916 Railroad Commissioners Map of Minnesota listed 87.71 miles of track. Due to the abundance of liver sausage in the logging camps along the line, it was nicknamed the \\"Gut and Liver Line.\\" Despite its name, the Minneapolis and Rainy River Railway never got within 200 miles of Minneapolis nor within 75 miles of the Rainy River.

Life From an ancient Westmoreland family, Leyburn was a great-great-grandson of Sir James Leyburn, MP for Westmorland under Henry VIII. His uncle James Leyburn was executed as a Catholic traitor in Lancaster in 1583. He was admitted a student in the English College at Douai on 13 March 1617, under the name of George Bradley. He studied philosophy under Thomas White, and was ordained priest on 5 August 1625. Subsequently, he lived in Arras College, Paris, and in 1630 went on the English mission. On landing at Dover he was arrested and committed to Dover Castle; but he obtained his liberty through the intercession of Queen Henrietta Maria, who made him one of her chaplains. She consulted him on matters relating to Catholics, until she was obliged by an Order in Council to dismiss all the ecclesiastics in her household. Leyburn was then imprisoned, and after being again released at the queen's request, he went back to Douai College, where he was employed in teaching philosophy and divinity. At this period he was created D.D. by the University of Reims. Shortly before the English Civil War broke out, he returned to England, and in 1644 he was a prisoner in the Tower of London; there he met George Monck, and foretold that he would be a general in the north, and would eventually command the three kingdoms. On his release Leyburn returned to France, where he supported the royalist party. In 1647 he was sent to Ireland, with credentials from the court in exile, in order to bring about a better understanding between the two Catholic armies and James Butler, Duke of Ormonde. In 1648 Richard Smith, bishop of Chalcedon, then residing at Paris, appointed Leyburn his vicar- general in England, in conjunction with Mark Harrington, B.D., of the Sorbonne. Later Leyburn was chosen president of the English College at Douai, on the death of William Hyde, and was installed by patent dated 24 June 1652. He governed the college for about eighteen years, resigning the presidency in favour of his nephew, John Leyburn, in 1670. Subsequently, he resided at Rome for a year and a half. He died at Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne on 29 December 1677. Throughout his life he was hostile to the jurisdiction of the Old Chapter in England.

The building was sold in 1991 to the Sennitt and Neate families who planned to redevelop the house into a nursing home. However prior to any planning permission being acquired, in 1998 the house was sold on to a consortium of housing developers and the main house was converted into 12 apartments in 2004. The estate is now maintained as an open space by Bristol City Council, known as Stoke Park Estate. Several aspects of the house and estate are listed. The house is Grade II* listed.

It is the oldest wreck of a European ship in the Americas to have been scientifically excavated.Leshikar- Denton: 286 Museum: Brief history, Part 2 Discovery In 1976, unlicensed treasure hunters discovered a wreck on Molasses Reef, on the southwestern edge of the Caicos Bank near French Cay. The site of the wreck has been described as a \\"ship trap\\". The remains of several other wrecks are scattered on top of and around the earliest wreck.Keith: 82 The treasure hunters, who were looking for Spanish treasure ships, recognized that the ordnance in the wreck was from the 1490s or early 1500s, too early for a treasure ship. In 1980, a salvage company organized by those treasure hunters applied for a license from the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands to explore and salvage shipwrecks. After receiving the license, the company announced that it had discovered the wreck of Christopher Columbus' ship Pinta, and anticipated making large profits from marketing artifacts from the Pinta and other wrecks of treasure ships in the area. Concerned about the salvage company's plans, the Turks and Caicos Islands government invited the Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&M; University to survey the wreck site. Later a new group arrived in the Turks and Caicos Islands, claiming to have inherited the rights of the earlier salvage company. After receiving permission to explore wrecks other than the Molasses Reef wreck, but not to remove any artifacts, this group proceeded to take artifacts without permission from numerous sites, including Molasses Reef. The government then revoked the company's salvage license, and invited the Institute of Nautical Archaeology to excavate the Molasses Reef Wreck.Museum: Brief History, Where Keith: 82 Scientific excavation When researchers from the Institute of Nautical Archaeology returned to Molasses Reef in 1982 they discovered that extensive damage had occurred since the earlier survey. Someone had used pipe bombs to dislodge artifacts from the wreck, leaving a large crater and damaged artifacts. Over the next three years the archaeologists spent a total of six months excavating the site. They shipped more than ten tons of artifacts to Texas for cleaning, stabilization and study. Responsibility for the wreck and artifacts was transferred to a non-profit entity, Ships of Exploration and Discovery Research, which was set up by the archaeologists working on the project. In 1990 all of the artifacts were returned to the Turks and Caicos Islands and placed in a new National Museum, opened in 1991, housing displays about the wreck.Keith: 82-83, 84 Leshikar-Denton: 286 Origin and age While only a very small portion of the wooden hull had survived, the archaeologists were able to determine the size and some of the structure of the ship from the distribution of ballast stones and from marks made in the sea floor by parts of the hull that had disintegrated since the wreck. The ship was about 19 meters long with a beam of five to six meters and a draft of two meters or a bit more. The ship had at least three masts; metal parts of rigging found indicate that both square- rigged and lateen sails were used on the ship. The surviving parts of the hull showed construction techniques typical of 15th- and 16th-century Portuguese and Spanish ships, indicating this ship was a caravel. The age of the wreck indicates that the ship was built in Spain or Portugal and sailed across the Atlantic. The ballast was found to consist of stones from several points of origin, primarily from near Lisbon, but also from one or more of the Macaronesian islands (the Azores, Madeira and/or the Canary Islands) and from near Bristol, England.Keith: 83-84 Museum: Part 1 An attempt was made to date the wreck by analyzing growth rings on a large coral head growing on the wreck, but the coral was found to be only 250 years old.Keith:83 Artifacts found at the wreck site included items typically carried on Spanish ships in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Haquebuts, a type of arquebus, which ceased being part of a Spanish ship's usual equipment after about 1515, and a type of bowl called melado escudilla (literally, \\"honey bowl\\"), which stopped being used after about 1520, were found in the wreck. Other types of artifacts which were commonly carried on Spanish ships later in the 16th century were not found at the wreck site. This evidence indicates that the ship probably wrecked within a few years of 1513, making it the earliest wreck of a European ship in the Americas that has been scientifically excavated. Artifacts A large number of arms, including cannons and small arms, bowls and storage jars, surgical and carpentry tools, as well as wooden pieces of the hull and metal pieces from the rigging, have been recovered from the wreck. Arms on the ship included two bombardettas, fifteen versos (a type of breech-loading swivel gun), haquebuts, haquebuzes (a smaller type of arquebus), grenades, crossbows and quarrels, swords, daggers, breech chambers (powder cartridges) for the bombardetas and versos, shot molds and sheets of lead to be melted as needed to make shot. The wreck also contained many pot sherds from a variety of olive jars, escudillas (bowls) and lebrillos (basins) of styles typical of Spanish and Portuguese pottery of the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Some more crudely made vessels of uncertain provenance were also found.Museum: Brief History, Part 2, Part 3 Mission The ship that wrecked on Molasses Reef has not been identified despite extensive searches of records. Over 120 European ships are known to have been lost in the Americas by 1520, but none of them can be matched to the Molasses Reef Wreck. The lack of personal possessions in the wreck indicates that the crew was able to abandon ship, but there are no signs that the Spanish tried to salvage the armament on the ship. Four sets of bilboes were found at the wreck site. The bilboes may have been for use in punishing crew members, but they were also used to restrain slaves aboard ships. The ship may have been hunting for Lucayans in the Bahama Islands (in the broader sense that includes the now politically separate Turks and Caicos Islands) to take to Hispaniola as slaves (technically, as workers in the encomienda system). As the natives of Hispaniola died out, the Spanish recruited Lucayans to replace them. By 1513 almost all of the Lucayans had been removed from the southern Bahama Islands. This would accord with a wreck date no later than 1513.Keegan: 212-13, 220-23 Keith: 84 Museum: Part 4 Notes Citations References *Keegan, William F.

It is the most common form of sailboat racing and contrasts with match racing and team racing. Fleet racing can take place in two main formats. In the \\"One-Design\\" basis, all boats in the fleet are of the same class (i.e., the same design, length, and sail area). Alternatively, different classes of boats can race on a handicap basis, where faster classes give time to slower classes either by starting the race later or having their finishing times adjusted after the race's completion. Racing can occur around or between buoys or geographical features such as islands, and take place over short inshore courses or long distances offshore (such as the Volvo Ocean Race). The rules for fleet racing are set by World Sailing and can be supplemented by race-specific rules set by the organisers of a particular race. Contraventions of the rules are resolved either by a boat voluntarily taking a penalty during the race, or by protest lodged and heard after the race. The rules of match racing, on the other hand, are normally enforced by umpires issuing penalties during a race. Fleet racing involves fewer strategic and tactical considerations for the sailor than match racing. In fleet racing, the most important factor in the outcome of a race is usually the speed of each boat. Three-time Olympic sailing gold medallist Ben Ainslie, who made a foray into match racing for the 2007 America's Cup, has described the differences between fleet racing and match racing as \\"huge\\". In the 2008 Olympics, all eleven sailing events were One-Design fleet races. On the other hand, the America's Cup is sailed as a series of match races.

Carpenter immigrated to the United States and continued his advocacy of the Flat Earth movement. Life Carpenter was born on 25 February 1830 in Greenwich, Kent, England, and baptised on 30 April 1830 at Maize Hill, formerly known as Bethel ‚Äì Independent in Greenwich. He was the eldest son of Samuel Carpenter and Lucy Moss. He married Annie Gillett in January‚ÄìMarch 1853, and they eventually had six children.

Appleton and Company, 1897, Third Series, Vol. I, p. 549. Advocate of the flat-Earth theory Carpenter was a passionate advocate of the flat-Earth theory, which holds that the Earth is not a globe. Carpenter, a printer originally from Greenwich, England, published Theoretical Astronomy Examined and Exposed ‚Äì Proving the Earth not a Globe in eight parts from 1864 under the name Common Sense. He later emigrated to Baltimore, where he published A hundred proofs the Earth is not a Globe in 1885. Carpenter argued that: * \\"There are rivers that flow for hundreds of miles towards the level of the sea without falling more than a few feet ‚Äî notably, the Nile, which, in a thousand miles, falls but a foot. A level expanse of this extent is quite incompatible with the idea of the Earth's convexity. It is, therefore, a reasonable proof that Earth is not a globe.\\" * \\"If the Earth were a globe, a small model globe would be the very best ‚Äì because the truest ‚Äì thing for the navigator to take to sea with him. But such a thing as that is not known: with such a toy as a guide, the mariner would wreck his ship, of a certainty!, This is a proof that Earth is not a globe.\\" Carpenter was a proponent of English writer Samuel Rowbotham (1816‚Äì1885), who produced a pamphlet, with Carpenter's assistance, called Zetetic Astronomy in 1849 arguing for a flat Earth and published results of many experiments that tested the curvatures of water over a long drainage ditch, followed by another, called The inconsistency of Modern Astronomy and its Opposition to the Scripture. Rowbotham also produced studies, mostly printed by Carpenter, that purported to show the effects of ships disappearing below the horizon could be explained by the laws of perspective in relation to the human eye.

His maternal uncle, Jack Daniel, was the eponymous founder of the whiskey manufacturer. Career Motlow began his career by working for his uncle. He inherited Jack Daniel's in 1907. Due to Prohibition, he was unable to sell whiskey from 1920 onward. As Lynchburg was a market town for mules at the time, Motlow sold harnesses instead. Motlow sued the Moore County court to be able to reopen his distillery after the end of Prohibition in 1933, but he was only able to do so in 1938. To reduce the powers of the county court, Motlow decided to run for office. He was elected as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1933, and as a member of the Tennessee Senate in 1939. By 1947, Jack Daniel's was the only whiskey distillery in Tennessee, then a dry state. Motlow owned thousands of acres in Moore County and Coffee County, where he bred Tennessee Walking Horses. His horses competed in the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration in Shelbyville. Personal life and death Motlow was married twice. He married his first wife, Clara Reagor, in 1895, and they had a son, J. Reagor Motlow. She died in 1901, and he married Ophelia Evans, with whom he had three more sons: Cliff Conner Motlow; Dan Evans Motlow; and Robert Motlow. They also had a daughter, Mary Avon Boyd. Lem Motlow suffered a stroke in 1940. He died of cerebral haemorrhage on September 1, 1947 in Lynchburg, at age 77. He was buried in the Lynchburg cemetery.

History  Riggs-Thomson House Holy Names was built on land that was originally owned by Charles Carroll of Carrollton. England's King Charles granted the land to Carroll. In 1828 Carroll ceded a 147 acres to James and Mary Ann Reynolds who in turn sold it to Thomas and Christina Simpson. Later, the land was acquired by George Washington Riggs, the founder of Riggs Bank of Washington, DC. On July 27, 1864 Joseph and Octabia Bryan purchased the property and built the first house on the land, which later became the Convent. The house was a white two-story home with a large kitchen, arched doorways, and carved doors. Fireplaces in each room provided heat. The home also included a ballroom in which, according to legend, Abraham Lincoln danced. Later, the main house served as a \\"station\\" on the Underground Railroad. The Bryans also built a second structure across the street from the school which became a nursing home. Eventually they sold the main house to the Thompsons and the land became known as Thompson's Farm. In 1923 the Jordan family purchased the land. After the stock market crashed in 1929, Mr. Jordan died. In 1933 the Sisters of the Holy Names purchased the land from Mrs. Jordan for $16,000. The house was used as St. Michael's Elementary School. The Sisters opened the high school in 1936 and in 1940 celebrated the first graduation of 24 students. Academy building in 2013 The Sisters expanded the program and built a large two-story brick building in 1951 that served as the main school building although they continued to hold classes in the Convent when space was needed. As of June, 1988 there were 52 graduating classes and a total of 2,700 graduates. Patterson, Homer L. Patterson's American education, Volume 59, 1953. The school was founded in 1934 and run by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary (SNJM). In 1933, the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary purchased the Riggs-Thompson House and several undeveloped lots along Ellsworth Drive, Pershing Drive and Springvale Road. Originally the school began as an elementary school. High school classes were added in 1936. In 1951 the school added the main two-story brick building, facing Springvale Road. The school closed due to declining enrollment.

P. aciculare has both crustose (crust-like) and fruticose thallus (shrub-like) body parts. The lichen starts out as a granular crust on the rock surface, and develops fruticose stalks, or pseudopodetia, up to tall and about 1 mm thick that have rounded black apothecia at the tips. The stalks are erect and curved so as to appear combed. It grows directly on silicate rocks in dense clusters. It is found on the west coast of North America up to Alaska, and in eastern Eurasia. In addition to green algae, the lichen contains cyanobacteria that help contribute to soil fertility by supplying fixed nitrogen. It was originally described in 1803, and transferred to the genus Pilophorus in 1857. History, taxonomy and phylogeny The species was first described in 1803 as Baeomyces acicularis by the Swedish botanist and \\"father of lichenology\\" Erik Acharius. The taxon was transferred to several different genera in the next few decades resulting in several synonyms, including Cenomyces acicularis (by Acharius in 1810), Cladonia acicularis (Elias Magnus Fries in 1831), and Stereocaulon aciculare (Edward Tuckerman in 1845). Elias Fries's son Thore Magnus transferred the species to his then newly created genus Pilophorus in 1857. William Nylander also published the combination Pilophorus acicularis in 1857, but later analysis suggested that Fries's combination was published first, and under the Principle of Priority, the correct citation of the species is Pilophorus acicularis (Ach.) Th.Fr. (1857). The genus Pilophorus was until recently considered to be a member of the family Stereocaulaceae by some authors.Tehler A. (1996). 1996. Systematics, phylogeny and classification. In T. H. Nash III [ed.], Lichen biology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Analysis of small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences showed P. acicularis to be more closely related to the Cladoniaceae, rather than the Stereocaulaceae. The specific epithet aciculare is derived from the Latin acicularis, meaning \\"needle-like\\". The lichen is commonly known as the \\"devil's matchstick\\"; the common name for the genus‚Äî\\"nail lichen\\"‚Äîis also used. Description A crust- like thallus and developing pseudopodetia are evident beside taller, more mature pseudopodetia. The thallus is the vegetative body of a lichen that contains the lichen mycobiont (fungus) and the photobiont (algae and/or cyanobacteria). In P. acicularis, the primary thallus (thallus horizontalis) is spread out like a granular crust on the surface of its substrate. It is light green when young, but becomes gray in age or when dry. The pseudopodetia (upright stalk-like extensions of the thallus made of vegetative tissue) range from high, and are about 1 mm thick; they grow in dense clusters. Most pseudopodetia are either unbranched or forked into two branches, with the stalks curved so as to appear as if combed; less frequently, they are erect like pins, and up to tall. Some specimens are highly branched in the upper part of the pseudopodetia, causing them to bear some resemblance to P. robustus, although this morphology is uncommon. Internally, the pseudopodetia are solid when young, becoming hollow with age, and are composed of long, thin, highly gelatinized hyphae with narrow cavities about 0.5 Œºm wide. The lower part of older pseudopodetia becomes blackened internally. The algal layer is not continuous‚Äîcontrasting with lichen species that have thalli that stratify into discrete tissue types, including a photobiont layer‚Äîand occurs with the mycobiont in the form of granules. These granules may be absent from some parts of the thallus surface. Pycnidia (flask-like structures, resembling perithecia, in which conidia are produced) occur in the tips of small sterile pseudopodetia or in the tips of small lateral branches of older pseudopodetia. The conidiophores of P. acicularis are 30 Œºm long, and unbranched. They have terminal sickle-shaped conidia that measure 6 by 1 Œºm. The apothecia (reproductive structures covered with the spore-producing asci) are abundant, usually with one or several on the tips of the pseudopodetia. They are black, hemispherical or roughly triangular, and measure up to 1.5 mm in diameter. The hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing layer of cells containing the asci) is up to 240 Œºm thick, and about two-thirds of it is pigmented; the lower part of the hymenium is sterile, consisting of only paraphyses. The asci are eight- spored. The ascospores are rounded when young, becoming spindle-shaped when mature, with dimensions of 21.0‚Äì29.5 by 4.5‚Äì5.5 Œºm. The generative tissue (hyphae that eventually forms the thallus) is closely interwoven with short, broad cells that have large cavities. The generative tissue is pigmented black-brown, with the color being most intense below the paraphyses, becoming less so towards the stalk region. Pilophorus acicularis is a tripartite lichen‚Äîcontaining a fungus, a green alga, and a cyanobacterium. Cephalodia (lichenized aggregations of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria) are present on the primary thallus; smaller cephalodia are also on the pseudopodetia. Hemispherical to irregularly shaped, and light to dark brown in color, they contain species from the genus Nostoc. The green algal photosynthetic symbiont (photobiont) associated with P. acicularis is Asterochloris magna (formerly Trebouxia magna). =Similar species= Pilophorus acicularis can be separated from similar species by its tall pseudopodetia. It may be confused with P. robustus, especially in material from Alaska where both species occur together. Usually, the different branching (umbellate in P. robustus versus dichotomous in P. acicularis) and the lack of a columella (an internal, column-shaped structure) in longitudinal sections of the pseudopodetia of P. acicularis make it relatively easy to distinguish between the two. Pilophyllus clavatus, a species found in Western North America, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, resembles P. acicularis, but it has much shorter pseudopodetia‚Äîup to long. Habitat and distribution The lichen typically grows on silicate stone, rarely on decaying wood. It is usually in partial shade in openings in low to mid-elevation moist forests, and is also frequently found in rocky roadcuts. Lichens with cephalodia are capable of fixing nitrogen, and contribute nitrogen to the ecosystem. P. acicularis is probably the most abundant species of the genus. Most specimens have been found on the west coast of North America as far north as Alaska, but it has been reported most frequently from British Columbia and Washington. The species is found in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and has also been reported from the Russian arctic. In general, P. acicularis seems to prefer an oceanic climate without extremely low temperatures, at least in comparison with other species of the genus. This assumption is supported by the fact that P. acicularis is found more southerly (34 findings in California) than all other species and is less frequently found in northern Alaska where, for example, P. robustus and P. vegae are more common. P. acicularis is rare east of the Rocky Mountains.

Supporters hope that greater knowledge will lead to earlier detection of breast cancer, which is associated with higher long-term survival rates, and that money raised for breast cancer will produce a reliable, permanent cure. Breast cancer advocacy and awareness efforts are a type of health advocacy. Breast cancer advocates raise funds and lobby for better care, more knowledge, and more patient empowerment. They may conduct educational campaigns or provide free or low-cost services. Breast cancer culture, sometimes called pink ribbon culture, is the cultural outgrowth of breast cancer advocacy, the social movement that supports it, and the larger women's health movement. The pink ribbon is the most prominent symbol of breast cancer awareness, and in many countries the month of October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Some national breast cancer organizations receive substantial financial support from corporate sponsorships. Breast cancer awareness campaigns have been criticized for minimizing risks of screening programs, conflicts of interest, and a narrow focus of research funding on screening & existing treatments at the expense of prevention and new treatments. Marketing approaches The goal of breast cancer awareness campaigns is to raise the public's \\"brand awareness\\" for breast cancer, its detection, its treatment, and the need for a reliable, permanent cure. Increased awareness has increased the number of women receiving mammograms, the number of breast cancers detected, and the number of women receiving biopsies. Overall, as a result of awareness, breast cancers are being detected at an earlier, more treatable stage. Awareness efforts have successfully utilized marketing approaches to reduce the stigma associated with the disease. Generally speaking, breast cancer awareness campaigns have been highly effective in getting attention for the disease. Breast cancer receives significantly more media coverage than other prevalent cancers, such as prostate cancer. =Breast cancer as a brand= A pink ribbon, an international symbol of breast cancer awareness. Breast cancer advocacy uses the pink ribbon and the color pink as a concept brand to raise money and increase screening. The breast cancer brand is strong: people who support the \\"pink brand\\" are members of the socially aware niche market, who are in favor of improved lives for women, believe in positive thinking, trust biomedical science to be able to solve any problem if given enough money, and prefer curative treatments to prevention.; The brand ties together fear of cancer, hope for early identification and successful treatment, and the moral goodness of women with breast cancer and anyone who visibly identifies themselves with breast cancer patients. This brand permits and even encourages people to substitute conscientious consumption and individual symbolic actions, like buying or wearing a pink ribbon, for concrete, practical results, such as collective political action aimed at discovering non-genetic causes of breast cancer. The establishment of the brand and the entrenchment of the breast cancer movement has been uniquely successful, because no countermovement opposes the breast cancer movement or believes that breast cancer is desirable. =Pink ribbon= A pink ribbon is a symbol of breast cancer awareness. It may be worn to honor those who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, or to identify products that a manufacturer would like to sell to consumers that are interested in breast cancer. Pink ribbons are sometimes sold as fundraisers, much like poppies on Remembrance Day. The pink ribbon is associated with individual generosity, faith in scientific progress, and an optimistic \\"can-do\\" attitude. It encourages individuals to focus on the emotionally appealing ultimate vision of a cure for breast cancer, rather than the reality that there is no certain cure for breast cancer, and no guarantee there will ever be such a cure. The practice of blindly wearing or displaying a pink ribbon without making other, more concrete efforts to cure breast cancer has been described as a kind of slacktivism due to its lack of real effects, and has been compared to equally simple yet ineffective \\"awareness\\" practices like the drive for women to post the colors of their bras on Facebook. Critics say that the feel-good nature of pink ribbons and \\"pink consumption\\" distracts society from the lack of progress in curing breast cancer. It is also criticized for reinforcing gender stereotypes and objectifying women and their breasts. =Events= Large events, such as walkathons, promote breast cancer awareness. Each year, the month of October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month by many governments, the media, and cancer survivors. The month-long campaign has been called Pinktober because of the increased production of pink goods for sale, and National Breast Cancer Industry Month by critics like Breast Cancer Action. BCAM was begun in 1985 by the American Cancer Society and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The organization that runs the official BCAM aims to promote mammography and other forms of early detection as the most effective means of fighting breast cancer. Typical BCAM events include fundraising-based foot races, walk-a-thons, and bicycle rides. Participants solicit donations to a breast cancer-related charity in return for running, walking, or riding in the event. Through mass-participation events, breast cancer survivors form a single, united group that speaks and acts consistently and shares a coherent set of beliefs. They also reinforce the cultural connection between each individual's physical fitness and moral fitness. Events organized by Avon or Komen are known to allocate around 25%-33% of donations to the funds needed to organize the event and advertise it. A Breast Cancer Awareness programme is in progress in India among Muslim women by a NGO. December, 2013. Various landmarks are illuminated in pink lights as a visible reminder of breast cancer, and public events, such as American football games, may use pink equipment or supplies. In 2010, all King Features Syndicate comic strips on one Sunday were printed in shades of red and pink, with a pink ribbon logo appearing prominently in one panel. Private companies may arrange a \\"pink day\\", in which employees wear pink clothes in support of breast cancer patients, or pay for the privilege of a relaxed dress code, such as Lee National Denim Day. Some events are directed at people in specific communities, such as the Global Pink Hijab Day, which was started in America to encourage appropriate medical care and reduce the stigma of breast cancer among Muslim women, and Male Breast Cancer Awareness Week, which some organizations highlight during the third week of October. Most events are well-received, but some, like the unauthorized painting of the Pink Bridge in Huntington, West Virginia, are controversial. =Companies and consumers= The basket contains an assortment of pink ribbon-branded promotional merchandise, including awareness bracelets, ink pens, candy, and emery boards. Thousands of breast cancer-themed products are developed and sold each year. Some of these items are everyday products that have been repackaged or repositioned to take advantage of cause-related marketing, such as teddy bears, clothing, jewelry, candles, and coffee mugs. These blended value objects offer consumers an opportunity to simultaneously buy an object and make a donation to a breast cancer organization. Some of these products are produced and/or sold by breast cancer survivors or charities for fundraising purposes, while others are for profits in addition to fundraising. Manufacturers also produce products with pink labels or pink ribbon logos to donate a sum of money to support the cause. The donation is typically capped so that it is reached after a fixed level of sales, although in some cases the company is providing only free advertising for a selected charity. Although advertising costs are rarely disclosed, some companies have been found to spend far more money advertising \\"pink products\\" and tie-ins than they donate to charitable organizations supporting research or patients. For example, in 2005, 3M spent US$500,000 advertising post-it notes printed with a pink ribbon logo. Sales were nearly double what the company expected, but the campaign resulted in a $300,000 donation. Advertisers and retail consultants have said that because of consumer cynicism, a company can benefit from marketing its support for a cause such as breast cancer awareness only when the company treats that support as \\"a commitment and not a marketing opportunity\\". Andrew Benett, an executive at Euro RSCG said that because consumers \\"have become more mindful, more thoughtful, about how they consume, where they consume, why they consume\\", companies cannot succeed by \\"just slapping a pink ribbon on a product and [expecting that] people will buy more\\". Pink products have also been condemned as promoting consumerism, materialism, and environmental degradation. Critics are also concerned that the ubiquity of pink products may mislead people into thinking that significant progress has been made, and that small, individual actions, like buying a breast cancer-themed product, are sufficient. Responding to criticism, Komen CEO Nancy G. Brinker said that corporate promotions enabled the organization to reach new audiences and that \\"America is built on consumerism. To say we shouldn't use it to solve the social ills that confront us doesn't make sense to me\\". The first breast cancer awareness stamp in the U.S., featuring a pink ribbon, was issued in 1996. As it did not sell well, a semi-postal stamp without a pink ribbon, the breast cancer research stamp, was designed in 1998. Products like these emphasize the relationship between being a consumer and supporting women with breast cancer. In Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint produced 30 million 25-cent coins with pink ribbons during 2006 for normal circulation. Designed by the mint's director of engraving, Cosme Saffioti (reverse), and Susanna Blunt (obverse), this colored coin is the second in history to be put into regular circulation. Business marketing campaigns, particularly sales promotions for products that increase pollution or have been linked to the development of breast cancer, such as alcohol, high-fat foods, some pesticides, or the parabens and phthalates used by most cosmetic companies, have been condemned as pinkwashing (a portmanteau of pink ribbon and whitewash). Such promotions generally result in a token donation to a breast cancer-related charity by taking advantage of the consumers' fear of cancer and grief for people who have died to drive sales. Critics say that these promotions, which net more than US$30 million each year just for fundraising powerhouse Susan G. Komen for the Cure, do little more than support the marketing machines that produce them. Komen says that corporate sponsorships are necessary to pay for the organization's efforts: in the 2010 fiscal year it spent $175 million on public health education and awareness campaigns, $75 million on medical research and about $67 million on treatment and screenings for patients. Two significant campaigns against pink consumption are the National Breast Cancer Coalition's \\"Not Just Ribbons\\" campaign, and Breast Cancer Action's \\"Think Before You Pink\\" campaign. NBCC's \\"Not Just Ribbons\\" campaign sought to focus awareness efforts onto substantive issues such as genetic discrimination, access to cancer treatment, patient rights, and environmental breast cancer research. \\"Think Before You Pink\\" encouraged consumers to ask questions about pink products (e.g., to find out how much of a donation was being made). =Advertisements= trolley advertisement promotes cosmetics company Avon Products, Inc. and breast cancer awareness. Because of the pink ribbon brand's strength, the advertisement is easily recognized as a promotion for breast cancer awareness, even among people who cannot read the Japanese text. Many corporate and charitable organizations run advertisements related to breast cancer, especially during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, in the hope of increasing sales by aligning themselves with a positive, helpful message. In addition to selling pink products, corporate advertisements may promote the company's progressive policies, or may provide free advertising for a chosen charity. Medical institutions may run advertisements for mammogram or other breast-related services. Non-profit organizations often benefit from public service announcements, which are free advertisements provided by newspapers, radio and television stations, and other media. Some marketing blurs the line between advertisements and events, such as flash mobs as a form of guerrilla marketing. The typical participant in the breast cancer movement, and therefore the advertisers' target audience, is a white, middle-aged, middle- class, well-educated woman. Some corporate sponsors are criticized for having a conflict of interest. For example, some of the prominent sponsors of these advertisements include businesses that sell the expensive equipment needed to perform screening mammography; an increase in the number of women seeking mammograms means an increase in their sales, which has led critics to say that their sponsorship is not a voluntary act of charity, but an effort to increase sales. The regulated drug and medical device industry uses the color pink, positive images, and other themes of the pink ribbon culture in direct-to- consumer advertising to associate their breast cancer products with the fear, hope, and wholesome goodness of the breast cancer movement. This is particularly evident in advertisements designed to sell screening mammograms. Social role of the woman with breast cancer A woman being treated with docetaxel chemotherapy for breast cancer. She keeps ice packs on her hands and feet to reduce temporary damage to her fingernails and toenails. The marketing of breast cancer awareness allows people to incorporate support for awareness into their personal identity or lifestyle. Socially aware, pro-woman individuals, businesses, politicians, and organizations use pink ribbons and other trappings of breast cancer awareness to signal their support for women, health, and mainstream medicine. =The she-ro= The term she-ro, derived from hero, is used in discussions of breast cancer to refer to women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, and sometimes to those who have survived breast cancer. The term describes an \\"idealized\\" patient who combines assertiveness, optimism, femininity and sexuality, despite the effects of treatment, and as a \\"paragon [who] uses a diagnosis of breast cancer as a catalyst for a personal transformation\\". Sociologist Gayle Sulik analyzed the she-ro's social role and ascribes it qualities that include being an educated medical consumer with a brave, pleasant and optimistic public appearance and demeanor, who aggressively fights breast cancer through compliance with screening guidelines and \\"disciplined practice of 'breast health'\\". In America the she-ro is diagnosed early due to adherence to early screening recommendations, and, by definition, she survives her diagnosis and treatment. The role emphasizes the femininity and female gender role of the she-ro, offsetting the masculine characteristics of assertiveness, selfishness and \\"fighting\\" cancer by cultivating a feminine appearance and concern for others. During and after treatment, the she-ro regains her femininity by using breast reconstruction, prosthetic devices, wigs, cosmetics, and clothing to present an aesthetically appealing, upper-class, heterosexual feminine appearance and by maintaining relationships in which she can nurture other people. Following the proper feeling rules of the breast cancer culture is encouraged, including remaining optimistic of a full cure, rationalizing the selfishness of treatment as a temporary measure, and feeling guilty that it forces her to put her needs momentarily above the needs of others or due to her perceived inadequacy in caring for her family or other women with cancer. Also included in the role is a form of the have-it-all superwoman, cultivating a normal appearance and activity level and minimizing the disruption that breast cancer causes to people around her. Consequences The effort of maintaining the role of a she-ro can be stressful. The role encourages women with breast cancer to care for others rather than themselves. Some of them find this comforting, but it may lead to them feeling reluctant or unable to ask for the help they need or want, and this can lead to bitterness that their friends and family did not offer these services unbidden. The success of their efforts to look and act normally may paradoxically increase their dissatisfaction, as their apparent ability to handle it all discourages people from offering help. The breast cancer culture celebrates women who display the attitude deemed correct, which implies that their continued survival is due to this positive attitude and fighting spirit. While cheerfulness, hope, and good social support can be advantageous to health outcomes, it cannot determine survival rates. Women who reject the she-ro model may find themselves socially isolated by the breast cancer support groups that are nominally supposed to help them. Support from \\"the sisterhood\\" favors the \\"passionately pink\\", and tends to overlook women whose response to being diagnosed with breast cancer is incompatible with the pink ribbon culture, because they feel angry, unhappy, or afraid. The breast cancer culture is ill-equipped to deal with women who are dying or who have died, and their experiences may not be memorialized, validated or represented as part of the movement, instead being ignored or shunned as failures and as hope-destroying examples of reality. Similarly, the culture is also ill-equipped to deal with the news that a previously hyped treatment or screening procedure has been determined to be ineffective, with women advocating for the acceptance and promotion of inexpedient activities and inefficient or even sometimes harmful drugs.; ; =Breast cancer culture= Breast cancer culture, or pink ribbon culture, is the set of activities, attitudes, and values that surround and shape breast cancer in public. The dominant values are selflessness, cheerfulness, unity, and optimism. It is pro-doctor, pro-medicine, and pro-mammogram. Health care professionals are sources of information, but the rightness of their advice is not to be seriously questioned by women with breast cancer. Patients are not encouraged to ask where research money is going or if the research industry is making progress in finding the \\"cure\\". The emphasis on cheerfulness allows society to blame women for developing breast cancer and limits their responses to certain culturally determined scripts. The requirement of cheerful optimism arose from the then-popular theory that cancer had a psychosomatic origin and that people who were diagnosed with cancer had a \\"cancer personality\\" that was depressed, repressed, and self-loathing. Psychotherapy was therefore considered an adjunct treatment used to produce a cheerful, self-affirming identity. This theory was predominant among psychiatrists through the 1970s, but has since been discredited.; In a process called benefit finding, the she-ro uses the emotional trauma of being diagnosed with breast cancer and the suffering of extended treatment to transform herself into a stronger, happier and more sensitive person who is grateful for the opportunity to become a better person. In particular, she sees breast cancer as an opportunity to give herself permission for necessary personal growth that she felt she was prohibited from or unable to make before. Breast cancer thereby becomes a rite of passage rather than a disease,; with pink ribbon culture honoring the suffering of its she-roes by selecting them based on the amount of misery they have experienced, and leading women whose treatment is less painful or debilitating to feel excluded and devalued. The suffering, particularly the extended suffering of months of chemotherapy and radiation treatment, forms a metaphorical type of ordeal or rite of passage that initiates women into the inner circle of breast cancer culture. Barbara Ehrenreich describes it this way: > Understood as a rite of passage, breast cancer resembles the initiation > rites so exhaustively studied by Mircea Eliade: First there is the selection > of the initiates‚Äîby age in the tribal situation, by mammogram or palpation > here. Then come the requisite ordeals‚Äîscarification or circumcision within > traditional cultures, surgery and chemotherapy for the cancer patient. > Finally, the initiate emerges into a new and higher status‚Äîan adult and a > warrior‚Äîor in the case of breast cancer, a \\"survivor\\". Mainstream pink ribbon culture has aspects that are trivializing, silencing, and infantilizing. Women with breast cancer are surrounded by childish kitsch such as pink teddy bears and crayons, but there is no equivalent gift of toy cars for men diagnosed with prostate cancer.; Women who choose not to conform to the culture may feel excluded and isolated; those who cannot conform to the prescribed triumphant script report feeling unable to share their stories honestly. Anger, negativity and fatalism transgress the feeling rules, and women with breast cancer who express anger or negativity are corrected by other women with breast cancer and members of the breast cancer support organizations.; Appearing unattractive‚Äîsuch as going out in public with a bare, bald head if treatment causes temporary hair loss‚Äîtransgresses the approved, upper-class style of pink femininity and provokes shaming comments from strangers. Programs such as Reach to Recovery and Look Good, Feel Better inform breast cancer patients of this cultural standard and help them conform to it.; This standard is not universally adhered to in every detail. Ehrenreich says that \\"[t]he question of wigs versus baldness...defines one of the few real disagreements in breast-cancer culture.\\" Some women have avant garde aesthetic tastes: \\"One decorates her scalp with temporary tattoos of peace signs, panthers, and frogs; another expresses herself with a shocking purple wig; a third reports that unadorned baldness makes her feel 'sensual, powerful, able to recreate myself with every new day'\\". Regardless of whether the transformation is towards a radical, natural or cosmetically enhanced appearance, treatment is always \\"a makeover opportunity\\". Since the beginning of the 21st century, breast cancer culture has become more sexualized, and many awareness campaigns now reflect the old advertising truism that sex sells. The \\"booby campaigns\\", such as \\"Save the Tatas\\" and the \\"I ‚ô• Boobies\\" gel bracelets, rely on a cultural obsession with breasts and a market that is already highly aware of breast cancer. This message trivializes women and reflects a belief that breast cancer is important because cancer and its treatment makes women feel less sexually desirable and interferes with men's sexual access to women's breasts, instead of because cancer and its treatment kill and disable women. These sexualized campaigns tend to attract a younger audience than traditional campaigns. At the same time, breast cancer culture tends to overlook men with breast cancer and women who do not fit the white, middle-class archetype. African-Americans involved with breast cancer organizations often feel like their role is to be the token minority. The primary purposes or goals of the breast cancer culture itself are to maintain breast cancer's dominance as the pre√´minent women's health issue, to promote the appearance that society is \\"doing something\\" effective about breast cancer, and to sustain and expand the social, political, and financial power of breast cancer activists. The breast cancer culture tells women with breast cancer that their participation in fundraising, social support of other women with breast cancer, and appearance at public events are critical activities that promote their own emotional recovery. Because of this message, some women begin to believe that refusing to raise money for breast cancer organizations or to become mentors for newly diagnosed women with breast cancer is an unhealthy response to breast cancer. =Feminism and the breast cancer wars= The breast cancer wars were a series of conflicts between advocates and others about the causes, treatments, and societal responses to breast cancer. Women in the late 1980s and 1990s followed the successful approach used by ACT-UP and other AIDS awareness groups, of staging media-friendly protests to increase political pressure. Prominent women who made the \\"wrong\\" choice were publicly excoriated, as when Nancy Reagan chose mastectomy over lumpectomy followed by six weeks of radiation therapy. The abortion‚Äìbreast cancer hypothesis was formulated when an early study showed a connection between voluntary abortions and the development of breast cancer in premenopausal women, which pitted breast cancer advocates against abortion rights advocates. Advocates for women's issues have said that breast cancer is special because of its status as a largely female disease, society's response to it is an ongoing indication of the status of women and the existence of sexism. Breast cancer activist Virginia Soffa wrote that \\"[a]s long as it is not a national priority, the breast cancer epidemic will remain a metaphor for how society treats women\\". Barbara Ehrenreich writes that, before the feminist movement \\"medicine was a solid patriarchy,\\" and women with breast cancer were often treated as passive, dependent objects, incapable of making appropriate choices, whose role was to accept whatever treatment was decreed by the physicians and surgeons, who held all of the power. Because of sexism in education, female surgeons were far outnumbered by their male counterparts, and until the 1990s, when Susan Love of the University of California, Los Angeles Breast Center published Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book, the physicians who provided breast cancer treatments were generally men. Love said that some male physicians tended to impose their own values on women, such as recommending mastectomy to older women because, being past the age of child bearing and breastfeeding, they no longer \\"needed\\" their breasts. The women's health movement promoted mutual aid, self-help, networking, and an active, informed role in the patient's health care. Since the end of the breast cancer wars, feminists have again objected to the breast cancer culture's treatment of women with breast cancer as little girls who need to be obedient to authority figures, cooperative, pleasant and pretty. Achievements of the breast cancer movement =Social progress= Breast cancer has been known to educated women and caregivers throughout history, but modesty and horror at the consequences of a largely untreatable disease made it a taboo subject. The breast cancer movement, which developed in the 1980s and 1990s out of 20th century feminist movements and the women's health movement, has mostly removed those taboos through its modern advocacy and awareness campaigns. Educated, empowered patients At the beginning and middle of the 20th century, breast cancer was usually discussed in hushed tones, as if it were shameful. As an example, The New York Times refused to publish an advertisement for a breast cancer support group in the early 1950s, stating that it would not print either the word breast or the word cancer. Later, however, several celebrities publicly disclosed their own health challenges, and the resulting publicity reduced the stigma. One of the first was Shirley Temple Black, the former child star, who announced her diagnosis in 1972. In October 1974, Betty Ford, the wife of the then-President of the United States, openly discussed her breast cancer diagnosis and mastectomy. Two weeks later, the wife of the then-Vice President also had a mastectomy for breast cancer. The next year, journalist Rose Kushner published her book, Breast Cancer: A Personal History and Investigative Report, which she had written while recovering from a modified radical mastectomy. More recently, Angelina Jolie has also come forward publicly regarding her experience surrounding her diagnosis and treatment, which managed to raise public awareness of the issue significantly. In one study, when a survey of women was taken following Jolie's announcement, awareness rose by 4% among those women surveyed. The media reported these women's health and their treatment choices, and even invited some to appear on talk shows to discuss breast cancer frankly. The breast cancer movement has resulted in widespread acceptance of second opinions, the development of less invasive surgical procedures, the spread of support groups, and other advances in patient care. The movement successfully separated diagnostic biopsy from mastectomy surgery; before about 1980, it was common to perform the biopsy and, if a quick review of tissues indicated a probable need, a mastectomy in the same surgery.; The one-step surgery prevented women from seeking different opinions about their treatment, and sent them into the surgery without knowing whether their breasts would be removed that day. In response to women's concerns over lymphedema after routine removal of lymph nodes during mastectomy, the more limited approach of sentinel node biopsy was developed. Advocacy efforts also led to the formal recommendation against the routine use of the Halsted radical mastectomy in favor of simple mastectomies and lumpectomies. The breast cancer movement has supported practical, educational, emotional, and financial care for women with breast cancer. Support groups, individual counseling opportunities, and other resources are made available to patients. Educational interventions using written material and brief one-to-one interaction about breast checking behaviour, breast cancer symptoms and age-related risk have the potential to increase breast cancer awareness in older women, over a sustained period of time. Increased resources for treatment and research Supporting breast cancer was seen as a distinctively pro-woman stance popular among public official. This has resulted in better access to care. For example, in much of the United States, low-income women with breast cancer may qualify for taxpayer-funded health care benefits, such as screening mammography, biopsies, or treatment, while women with the same income, but another form of cancer or a medical condition other than cancer, do not.As an example, the State of Texas pays for breast cancer treatment in women whose income is 200% of the Federal Poverty Income Guideline, but to be screened or treated for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or lung cancer, the income limit is 185% of FPIG Breast cancer advocates have successfully increased the amount of public money being spent on cancer research and shifted the research focus away from other diseases and towards breast cancer. Breast cancer advocates also raise millions of dollars for research into cures each year, although most of the funds they raise is spent on screening programs, education and treatment.; Most breast cancer research is funded by government agencies. The high level of awareness and organized political lobbying has resulted in a disproportionate level of funding and resources given to breast cancer research and care. Favoring breast cancer with disproportionate research may have the unintended consequence of costing lives elsewhere. In 2001 UK MP Ian Gibson said, \\"The treatment has been skewed by the lobbying, there is no doubt about that. Breast cancer sufferers get better treatment in terms of bed spaces, facilities and doctors and nurses\\". Risks of over-awareness Awareness has also led to increased anxiety for women. Early detection efforts result in overdiagnosis of precancerous and cancerous tumors that would never risk the woman's life (about one-third of breast cancers diagnosed through screening programs), and result in her being subjected to invasive and sometimes dangerous radiological and surgical procedures. In recent years, the definition of breast cancer has expanded to include non-invasive, non- cancerous conditions like lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and pre-cancerous or \\"stage 0\\" conditions like ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Despite the now- regretted decision to use the word carcinoma in these relatively common conditions (almost a quarter of \\"breast cancer\\" diagnoses in the USA), they are not life-threatening cancers. Women with these conditions are promoted as breast cancer survivors due to the fear they experienced before they became educated about their condition, rather than in respect of any real threat to their lives. This effectively increases the market size for breast cancer organizations, medical establishments, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and the makers of mammography equipment. Women fear dying from breast cancer more than dying from heart disease, even though, as of 2006, eleven times as many women died from heart disease and stroke as from breast cancer. According to cardiologist Lisa Rosenbaum, this may be because women \\"view heart disease as the consequence of having done something bad, whereas to get breast cancer is to have something bad happen to you\\". An emphasis on educating women about lifestyle changes that may have a small impact on preventing breast cancer often makes women feel guilty if they do develop breast cancer. Some women decide that their own cancer resulted from poor diet, lack of exercise, or other modifiable lifestyle factor, even though most cases of breast cancer are due to non-controllable factors, like genetics or naturally occurring background radiation. Adopting such a belief may increase their sense of being in control of their fate. Increased awareness inadvertently increases victim blaming.; Women who resist screening mammography or breast self-exams are subjected to social pressure, scare tactics, guilt, and threats from some physicians to terminate the relationship with the patient. Similarly, the emphasis on early detection results in many women wrongly blaming themselves if their cancer is not detected at an early stage. The promotion of research to make screening programs find ever more cancers is also criticized. One- third of diagnosed breast cancers might recede on their own. In addition to efficiently finding most deadly cancers, screening programs also find most non-life-threatening, asymptomatic breast cancers and pre-cancers, and miss some fast growing, aggressive, dangerous cancers. According to H. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice, \\"I'm certainly not asking anyone to stop getting mammograms. I am asking my profession to tell women the truth about overdiagnosis\\". Welch said that research on screening mammography has taken the \\"brain-dead approach that says the best test is the one that finds the most cancers\\" rather than the one that finds dangerous cancers. Clinicians have responded that they are unwilling to consider the possibility of leaving potential deadly cancers alone because it is \\"far-riskier\\" than the alternative. Eric Winer, director of the breast cancer program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says, \\"I don't know anyone who offers women the option of doing nothing\\". Further complicating the issue of early diagnosis is the fact that it is currently impossible to distinguish malicious cancers from benign ones. Otis Brawley, a top official for the American Cancer Society, says that \\"even if we overdiagnose 1 in 5, we have numerous studies showing that by treating all these women, we save a bunch of lives\\". For instance, a 2011 Cochrane review showed a sample of mammogram screening programs resulted in a 15% reduction in mortality rate despite over-diagnosis, indicating that mammography programs save lives regardless of over-diagnosis. Conflicts of interest in organizations Some critics say that breast cancer awareness has transformed the disease into a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitches.; Corporate marketing machines promote early detection of breast cancer, while also opposing public health efforts, such as stricter environmental legislation, that might decrease the incidence rate of breast cancer. These critics believe that some of the breast cancer organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G. Komen for the Cure, have become captive companies that support and provide social capital to the breast cancer industry, including pharmaceutical companies, mammography equipment manufacturers, and pollution- causing industries, as well as large corporations, creating or exacerbating other problems. For example, Ford Motor Company ran a \\"Warriors in Pink\\" promotion on their Ford Mustang sports car, which critics say was intended to sell cars and counter the bad publicity the company received by reducing its workforce by tens of thousands of people, causing many of them to lose their health insurance, rather than to prevent or cure breast cancer. A Ford spokesperson acknowledged that the objective of the promotion was to \\"do good works throughout the community and derive some marketing exposure at the same time\\", but said that over the promotion's 15 years the company had donated $100 million and that the company continued the program during the automotive industry crisis of 2008‚Äì2010 because \\"It's part of our DNA now.\\" Ford believes that the recipient of the funds, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, benefited because Ford helped it reach \\"people who might not have thought of this organization before or may be supporting other organizations\\". However, the primary sponsors are part of the breast cancer industry, particularly cancer drug makers like AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Novartis. Because the national breast cancer organizations are dependent on corporate sponsorships for survival, this situation may represent a conflict of interest that prevents these organizations from representing the needs of current and future people with breast cancer when those needs conflict with the profit-making motives of the corporate sponsors. The structure of the breast cancer movement may allow large organizations to claim to be the voice of women with breast cancer, while simultaneously ignoring their desires. Some breast cancer organizations, such as Breast Cancer Action, refuse to accept funds from medical or other companies they disapprove of. Environmental breast cancer movement Most of the money raised by advocates is spent on increasing awareness, cancer screening, and existing treatments. Only a small fraction of the funds is spent on research, and less than 7% of the total research funding provided by breast cancer organizations goes to prevention. Instead, most of the charities fund research into detection and treatment. Advocates like Breast Cancer Action and women's health issues scholar Samantha King, whose book inspired the 2011 documentary Pink Ribbons, Inc., are unhappy that relatively little money or attention is devoted to identifying the non-genetic causes of breast cancer or to preventing breast cancer from occurring. The mainstream breast cancer culture has been criticized for focusing on detecting and curing existing breast cancer cases, rather than on preventing future cases.; As a result, screening mammography is promoted by the breast cancer culture as the sole possible approach to public health for breast cancer. Alternatives, such as pollution prevention, are largely ignored. As the majority of women with breast cancer have no risk factors other than sex and age, the environmental breast cancer movement suspects pollution as a significant cause, possibly from pesticides, plastics, and industrial runoff in ground water. Large organizations, such as Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the American Cancer Society, are not part of the environmental breast cancer movement. These large organizations benefit the most from corporate sponsorships that critics deride as pinkwashing, e.g., polluting industries trying to buy public goodwill by publishing advertisements emblazoned with pink ribbons, rather than stopping their pollution under the precautionary principle.; The non-genetic factors with consistent evidence increasing breast cancer risk include \\"ionizing radiation, combination estrogen‚Äìprogestin hormone therapy, and greater postmenopausal weight....for many other factors, the evidence from human studies is more limited, contradictory, or absent\\" and called for additional research. Conducting research into whether a chemical causes cancer is difficult, because \\"suspect chemicals cannot ethically be given to people to see if they cause cancer. People exposed in the past can be studied, but information about the dose and timing may be sketchy. Animal studies can provide useful information, but do not always apply to humans. And people are often exposed to mixtures of chemicals that may interact in complex ways, with effects that may also vary depending on an individual's genetic makeup\\". Samantha King says that prevention research is minimized by the breast cancer industry because there is no way to make money off of cases of breast cancer that do not happen, whereas a mammography imaging system that finds more possible cancers, or a \\"magic bullet\\" that kills confirmed cancers, would be highly profitable. =Breast Cancer Action= Breast Cancer Action is an American grassroots education and advocacy organization that promotes breast cancer awareness and public health issues relating to breast cancer, and advocates for system-wide change based on prevention. Breast Cancer Action is also known for its Think Before You Pink campaign, launched in 2002, which encourages consumers to ask critical questions before buying pink ribbon products. Dissent through art While the pink ribbon culture is dominant, there are alternatives. The environmental breast cancer movement is one type of dissent. Another is the rejection of compliant optimism, aesthetic normalization, and social pleasingness that the pink ribbon culture promotes. In 1998, the Art.Rage.Us art collective published a book that collected some of the art work from their traveling collection. This included art that was shocking, painful and realistic rather than beautiful, such as several self- portraits that showed mastectomy scars. Another art form has a wider range: the illness narrative has become a staple of breast cancer literature and is prominent in women's magazines. This may take the form of a restitution or cure narrative (the protagonist seeks a physical or spiritual return to a pre- diagnosis life), a quest narrative (the protagonist must meet a goal before dying), or a chaos narrative (the situation inexorably goes from bad to worse). The cure and quest narratives fit neatly with the breast cancer culture. Chaos narratives, which are rarer in stories about breast cancer, oppose it. History William Stewart Halsted, responsible for the radical mastectomy that dramatically reduced death rates due to breast cancer, but later proved to be controversial in its own right. Breast cancer has been known since ancient times. With no reliable treatments, and with surgical outcomes often fatal, women tended to conceal the possibility of breast cancer as long as possible. With the dramatic improvement in survival rates at the end of the 19th century‚Äîthe radical mastectomy promoted by William Stewart Halsted raised long-term survival rates from 10% to 50%‚Äîefforts to educate women about the importance of early detection and prompt action were begun.; Early campaigns included the \\"Women's Field Army\\", run by the American Society for the Control of Cancer (the forerunner of the American Cancer Society) during the 1930s and 1940s. Explicitly using a military metaphor, they promoted early detection and prompt medical intervention as every woman's duty in the war on cancer. In 1952, the first peer-to-peer support group, called Reach to Recovery, was formed. Later taken over by the American Cancer Society, it provided post-mastectomy, in-hospital visits from women who had survived breast cancer, who shared their own experiences, practical advice, and emotional support, but never medical information. This was the first program designed to promote restoration of a feminine appearance, e.g., through providing breast prostheses, as a goal. Organizations A wide variety of charitable organizations are involved in breast cancer awareness and support. These organizations do everything from providing practical support, to educating the public, to dispensing millions of dollars for research and treatment. Thousands of small breast cancer organizations exist. The largest and most prominent are: * Susan G. Komen for the Cure: Komen is the largest and best funded organization, with highly visible fundraisers. * National Breast Cancer Coalition: This large umbrella organization played key roles in several prominent pieces of American legislation, such as the creation of the United States Department of Defense's Breast Cancer Research Program, genetic non-discrimination laws, and the patients' bill of rights. They are committed to evidence-based medicine. * Breast Cancer Action: Famous for its \\"Think Before You Pink\\" campaign against pinkwashing, BCA emphasizes the need for research into pollution as a cause of breast cancer. Like the National Women's Health Network, they refuse funding from any group that may have a conflict of interest, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical imaging companies, or pollution-causing industries. * National Breast Cancer Organization: Closed in 2004. A dissenter to the notion of mandatory public unity, it provided case management and other services.

Dukes, 564 U.S. 338 (2011), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that a group of roughly 1.5 million women could not be certified as a valid class of plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit for employment discrimination against Walmart. Lead plaintiff Betty Dukes, a Walmart employee, and others alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion policies and practices in Walmart stores.AAUW Stands with the Women of Wal-Mart During U.S. Supreme Court Hearing, American Association of University Women. The Court agreed to hear argument on whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, Rule 23(b)(2), which provides for class-actions if the defendant's actions make injunctive relief appropriate, can be used to file a class action that demands monetary damages. The Court also asked the parties to argue whether the class meets the traditional requirements of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.10-277 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, Questions Presented, Supreme Court of the United States. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the class should not be certified in its current form but was only 5-4 on why so and whether the class could continue in a different form.  Background  In 2000, Betty Dukes, a 54-year-old Walmart worker in California, claimed sex discrimination. Despite six years of work and positive performance reviews, she was denied the training she needed to advance to a higher salaried position. Walmart argued that Dukes clashed with a female Walmart supervisor and was disciplined for admittedly returning late from lunch breaks. In June 2001, the lawsuit began in US District Court in San Francisco. The plaintiffs sought to represent 1.6 million women, including women who were currently working or who had previously worked in a Walmart store since December 26, 1998.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended October 31, 2005 Federal District Court In June 2004, the federal district judge, Martin Jenkins, ruled in favor of class certification under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).https://walmart.walmartclass.com/staticdata/walmartclass/classcert.pdf Walmart appealed the decision. Court of Appeals On February 6, 2007, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's class certification. Judge Harry Pregerson wrote for the majority, which also included Judge Michael Daly Hawkins. Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld dissented and criticized the majority's view of the class certification standards.Original opinion, February 2007 Walmart promptly filed for a rehearing and a rehearing en banc, contending that the majority committed legal error with regard to whether the grounds for class action certification had been met. On December 11, 2007, the same Ninth Circuit panel withdrew its initial opinion and issued a subsequent, superseding opinion, which still permitted the class certification. The panel dismissed the original petition for rehearing as moot in light of its superseding opinion, on the grounds that the revised opinion addresses the legal errors claimed in the petition, but Walmart was permitted to refile its petition. Among other changes to its original opinion, the Ninth Circuit altered its opinion with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony and the use of Daubert challenges during a motion for class certification. Walmart again filed for a rehearing en banc. On February 13, 2009, the Ninth Circuit granted Walmart's petition for rehearing en banc on the class action certification.Karen Gullo & Margaret Cronin Fisk, Wal-Mart Wins Request in Bias Case, Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2009, p.

As a result, the December 2007 Ninth Circuit opinion was no longer effective.Order for Rehearing En Banc On March 24, 2009 a panel of eleven Ninth Circuit judges, led by Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, heard oral arguments for the En Banc appeal.(audio of the en banc hearing) On April 26, 2010, the en banc court affirmed the district court's class certification on a 6-5 vote, with Judge Michael Daly Hawkins writing for the majority and Judge Sandra Segal Ikuta writing for the dissent. Walmart's lead appellate counsel, Theodore Boutrous, Jr., said in a statement that the decision violates \\"both due process and federal class action rules, contradicting numerous decisions of other federal appellate courts and the Supreme Court itself\\" and indicated that Walmart would appeal to the Supreme Court. Plaintiffs' counsel argued that \\"Wal-Mart is attempting to dismantle the Supreme Court's employment discrimination class action jurisprudence [that] would require the Court to overrule 45 years of civil rights and class action precedent.\\" Supreme Court Decision On December 6, 2009, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Walmart's appeal as Wal- Mart v.

So, : ( abla_X J)X =0 for every vector field X on M. In particular, a K√§hler manifold is nearly K√§hler. The converse is not true. For example, the nearly K√§hler six-sphere S^6 is an example of a nearly K√§hler manifold that is not K√§hler. The familiar almost complex structure on the six- sphere is not induced by a complex atlas on S^6. Usually, non K√§hlerian nearly K√§hler manifolds are called \\"strict nearly K√§hler manifolds\\". Nearly K√§hler manifolds, also known as almost Tachibana manifolds, were studied by Shun-ichi Tachibana in 1959 and then by Alfred Gray from 1970 on. For example, it was proved that any 6-dimensional strict nearly K√§hler manifold is an Einstein manifold and has vanishing first Chern class (in particular, this implies spin). In the 1980s, strict nearly K√§hler manifolds obtained a lot of consideration because of their relation to Killing spinors: Thomas Friedrich and Ralf Grunewald showed that a 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold admits a Riemannian Killing spinor if and only if it is nearly K√§hler. This was later given a more fundamental explanation B√§r, Christian (1993) Real Killing spinors and holonomy. Comm. Math. Phys. 154, 509‚Äì521. by Christian B√§r, who pointed out that these are exactly the 6-manifolds for which the corresponding 7-dimensional Riemannian cone has holonomy G2. The only compact simply connected 6-manifolds known to admit strict nearly K√§hler metrics are S^6,mathbb{C}mathbb{P}^3, mathbb{P}(Tmathbb{CP}_2), and S^3times S^3. Each of these admits such a unique nearly K√§hler metric that is also homogeneous, and these examples are in fact the only compact homogeneous strictly nearly K√§hler 6-manifolds. However, Foscolo and Haskins recently showed that S^6 and S^3times S^3 also admit strict nearly K√§hler metrics that are not homogeneous. B√§r's observation about the holonomy of Riemannian cones might seem to indicate that the nearly-K√§hler condition is most natural and interesting in dimension 6. This actually borne out by a theorem of Nagy, who proved that any strict, complete nearly K√§hler manifold is locally a Riemannian product of homogeneous nearly K√§hler spaces, twistor spaces over quaternion-K√§hler manifolds, and 6-dimensional nearly K√§hler manifolds. Nearly K√§hler manifolds are also an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with parallel totally antisymmetric torsion. Nearly K√§hler manifolds should not be confused with almost K√§hler manifolds. An almost K√§hler manifold M is an almost Hermitian manifold with a closed K√§hler form: domega = 0. The K√§hler form or fundamental 2-form omega is defined by :omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y), where g is the metric on M. The nearly K√§hler condition and the almost K√§hler condition are essentially exclusive: an almost Hermitian manifold is both nearly K√§hler and almost Kahler if and only if it is K√§hler.

Early life Terry Kohler was born on May 14, 1934, in Sheboygan, Wisconsin. His father was Walter J. Kohler, Jr. (1904‚Äì76), a sales executive at the Kohler Company, president of The Vollrath Company, and a three-term Governor of Wisconsin. His mother was Marie Celeste McVoy Kohler (1900-1974), a Chicago socialite who had been married and divorced and had one child. Terry's sister is Charlotte Nicolette Kohler (1936-2012). The Kohlers divorced in 1946 and Terry was raised by his father at Windway, his parents' estate not far from the Kohler factory in the village of Kohler. In 1952, Kohler graduated from the Admiral Farragut Academy. In 1962, he received a bachelor of science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, majoring in industrial management. A year later he earned an MBA in the same field from the MIT Sloan School of Management. Kohler married Diana Prange (1932-1991) of Sheboygan in 1956 (herself an heir to the H.C. Prange Co. department store fortune), and they had three daughters. The couple divorced in 1976. In 1981, Kohler married Mary Simpson, the mother of four sons. An outdoor sports enthusiast, Kohler raced sports cars in the mid-1960s, and spent six years on the National Ski Patrol. Kohler has sailed and raced sailboats for more than six decades, winning numerous trophies. He is a past Commodore of the Lake Michigan Sail Racing Federation. He was also awarded the Nathanael Herreshoff Trophy by US Sailing in 2009. Career Kohler's full-time association with the Vollrath Company, a manufacturer of stainless steel and aluminum wares, began in 1963. In 1976, he became the seventh president of the company. Kohler became chairman of the board and chief executive officer in 1982. Under Kohler's leadership, the company expanded dramatically. In July 1984, Lowell North sold his famous sailmaking company to Kohler, and in January 1989, North Sails and the Vollrath Company became separate corporations under the Windway Capital Corporation, a holding company.

Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410 (2011), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court, in an 8‚Äì0 decision, held that corporations cannot be sued for greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) under federal common law, primarily because the Clean Air Act (CAA) delegates the management of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Brought to court in July 2004 in the Southern District of New York, this was the first global warming case based on a public nuisance claim.  Case overview  Eight states, the City of New York, and three land trusts, separately sued the same electric power corporations that owned and operated fossil-fuel-fired power plants in twenty states. The plaintiffs sought to cap-and-abate the defendants' GHG emissions under public nuisance law due to ongoing contributions to global warming. They alleged that the defendants are the five largest emitters of GHGs in the United States, collectively emitting 650 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The plaintiffs claimed that by contributing to global warming the defendants are violating the federal common law of interstate nuisance. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissed both groups of plaintiffs' federal common law nuisance claims as non-justiciable under the political question doctrine, and the plaintiffs appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated and remanded. The Second Circuit held that the lawsuits were not barred by the political question doctrine, and the plaintiffs had adequately alleged Article III standing. Certiorari was granted by the United States Supreme Court.  Parties  standing following the precedent of Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency. = Plaintiffs = One group of plaintiffs was composed of the City of New York and eight states, including: California, Connecticut, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. However, New Jersey and Wisconsin eventually withdrew from the case. The other group of plaintiffs included three nonprofit land trusts: The Open Space Institute, the Open Space Conservancy, and the Audubon Society of New Hampshire.. = Defendants = The defendants were five private electric power companies: American Electric Power Co., American Electric Power Service Corp., Cinergy Co., Southern Co. Inc. of Georgia, and Xcel Energy Inc. of Minnesota, and the federal Tennessee Valley Authority.  Issues  # Whether states, cities, and private parties have standing to seek emissions caps on utilities for their alleged contribution to climate change. # Whether a cause of action to regulate carbon dioxide emissions can be inferred under federal common law even though the Clean Air Act designates authority for the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to the EPA. Noted cases Two Supreme Court cases played significant roles in the decisions made by the courts. = Baker v. Carr (1962) - Political Questions Doctrine = In Baker v. Carr, the main issue was deciding if redistricting (attempts to change the way voting districts are delineated) presents justiciable questions, which would allow federal courts to hear the case, or whether the case presented a political question. Any case that is deemed a \\"political question\\" cannot be resolved by federal courts. In the decision, Justice Brennan identified six factors to help determine which questions are political in nature. The six factors are: * Is there a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department (i.e. foreign affairs or executive war powers)? * Is there a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving the issue? * The impossibility of deciding the issue without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion. * The impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government. * Is there an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made? * Would attempting to resolve the matter create the possibility of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question? This ruling is significant in American Electric Power v. Connecticut because using the six-factor test that was established in Baker v. Carr, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' suit as presenting a non- justiciable political question because of the \\"impossibility of deciding the issue without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\\" However, the Second Circuit reversed this decision and using the six-factor test determined that the plaintiffs were not barred by the political question doctrine. = Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (2007) = In Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, the court held that the CAA gives the EPA the task of regulating carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. This is significant in the American Electrical Power v. Connecticut case because it establishes that carbon dioxide and GHG emissions regulations set by the EPA supersede federal common law. The EPA started phasing in requirements that new or modified GHG emitting facilities use the best available control technology (BACT) and started a rulemaking to set limits on GHG emissions from new, modified, and existing fossil-fuel fired power plants. The case of American Electric Power v. Connecticut started in 2004, well before the EPA began to regulate GHGs. Based on Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which permitted states to challenge EPA's refusal to regulate GHGs and effectively gave states a lower standing threshold than private parties, in American Electrical Power v. Connecticut the Supreme Court held that at least some of the plaintiffs had Article III standing, specifically the states. Procedural history = United States District Court for the Southern District of New York = The plaintiffs claimed that GHG emissions from the defendants' power plants have significantly contributed to global warming. By contributing to global warming, the defendants were violating the federal common law of interstate nuisance. According to the states and New York City, climate change poses risks to public lands, infrastructure, and human health. The private land trusts claimed climate change may cause destruction of habitat of rare species, trees and plants inhabiting land owned by the trusts. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The defendants claimed the plaintiffs raised a political question that was unfit for adjudication by the courts. The District Court dismissed both suits, stating they were non-justiciable matters that raised a political question that can only be addressed by the legislative or executive branches, leaving the court without jurisdiction. = United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit = The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the judgement of the district court, holding that the political question doctrine did not bar the plaintiffs' case from adjudication by using the six- factor test from Baker v. Carr. The Second Circuit also held that the plaintiffs had adequately alleged Article III standing under the federal common law of nuisance and maintained that states may bring suit to abate air and water pollution produced by other states or by out-of-state industry as stated in Illinois v. Milwaukee. The Second Circuit also held that the CAA did not displace federal common law of nuisance because it is a federal common law issue when dealing with ambient or interstate air and water as stated in Milwaukee I. In a ruling in September 2009, the Second Circuit determined the EPA failed to publicize any regulations pertaining to GHG emissions and could not speculate whether the hypothetical regulation of GHGs under the CAA would pertain to the issues raised by the plaintiffs. Based on that fact, the Second Circuit denied defendants' request for rehearing. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on December 6, 2010.  Supreme Court ruling  On June 20, 2011, Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court, with Justices Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy, Breyer, and Kagan joining. Justice Alito filed an opinion concurring in part and concurring in the judgement, which Justice Thomas joined. Justice Sotomayor took no part in the consideration or decision of the case as, prior to her elevation to the Supreme Court, she heard the case as a Second Circuit judge.Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co., Inc. 582 F.3d 309 (2d Cir. 2009), FN*. The Supreme Court rejected the plaintiffs' claim and the Second Circuit's holding that federal common law is not displaced since the EPA had not exercised its authority by setting emissions standards for the defendants' plants. However, after the Second Circuit delivered its opinion and prior to the Supreme Court's judgment, the EPA had taken several relevant actions following Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which included issuing the Endangerment Finding and establishing the Tailoring Rule, affecting the nation's largest greenhouse gas emitters. With the ruling in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency setting precedent, the court held that the authority of the EPA to regulate GHGs delegated by the CAA displaces any federal common law right of state, city, and private parties to seek abatement of carbon-dioxide emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. The Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs could not sue based on the federal common law of public nuisance because the federal common law was in fact displaced by a federal statute, the CAA. Displacement occurs when a statute \\"speaks directly to the question at issue.\\" Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency established that emissions of carbon dioxide qualify as air pollution subject to regulation under the CAA and that this \\"speaks directly\\" to the emissions of carbon dioxide from the defendants power plants. Based on EPA's designated authority, it is up to the EPA to decide whether and how to regulate GHGs from power plants. However, the court does leave a course of legal action open in the event the EPA does not enforce emissions limits against regulated sources by allowing \\"any person\\" to bring civil enforcement action in federal court. Also, if the EPA does not set emissions limits for certain pollutants or pollution sources, states and private parties can petition for a rulemaking in federal court.  Significance  The decision in this case confirms the EPA's primacy as the regulator of GHGs initially established in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency and limits the possibility of claiming federal common law public nuisance for climate change litigation. The decision in this case also impacted the decisions of similar climate change litigation. In Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corporation, the city of Kivalina brought suit against 24 oil, gas, coal, and utility companies claiming the destruction of the coastal city of Kivalina, Alaska is being caused by activities of the energy industry that are resulting in global warming. An appeal was filed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal, but it was rejected, holding that the plaintiff did not have standing under federal common law. Kivalina v. ExxonMobil Corporation followed the Supreme Court's decision in denying federal public nuisance claims of damages allegedly caused by GHGs as decided in American Electric Power Company v. Connecticut. In Comer v. Murphy Oil, the residents and owners of property along the Mississippi Gulf Coast filed a class action lawsuit against a multitude of oil, coal, and chemical companies, alleging that GHGs were emitted by the defendants, thereby contributing to air and sea temperature elevations, which caused glacial melting and rising sea levels. The foregoing actions fueled Hurricane Katrina, which caused damage to plaintiffs' property. This case was dismissed on two occasions. In Comer II, the court held that the CAA displaced the plaintiffs' public nuisance claim as in American Electric Power Company v. Connecticut and also preempted state law.

The channel was an independent company until the merger of Eagle Road Studios and Thaigem, which formed 'Gems TV UK Limited'. The original founders left the company and in 2008 it was floated on the Singapore Stock Exchange and become a corporate company; Gems TV Holdings Limited. The channel's original purpose was to sell affordable gemstone jewellery manufactured by its production facilities in Chanthaburi, Thailand. To reduce costs the parent company later reduced its own manufacturing and bought in jewellery from other suppliers.  Rocks TV  Gemporia US (formerly known as Rocks TV) is a former American reverse auction jewellery shopping channel which formerly was carried on American cable and satellite providers. The channel was launched on July 12, 2012 as Rocks TV, and operated from the United Kingdom from Gemporia's studios in Redditch, sharing Gems TV personnel. On December 1, 2015, Rocks TV was rebranded as Gemporia US. The network was mainly available via DirecTV via a purchased channel slot, along with the paid programming channels of various cable providers. It was discontinued on December 5, 2016, when it ended traditional wireline distribution to convert to an online-only model.  Gemporia.com  Gemporia launched a new website in August 2013, where customers can browse and buy jewellery, read up on the history of jewellery and gemstones, and watch web feeds of Gemporia's output.

It neighbors Otay Mesa West to the south and east, Egger Highlands and Nestor to the west, and Chula Vista to the north. It also serves as a gateway to the beach cities of Imperial Beach, and Coronado, by way of the Silver Strand isthmus, due to it being where California State Route 75 meets Interstate 5. Major thoroughfares include Coronado Avenue, Hollister Street, Beyer Boulevard, and Palm Avenue. History Prior to the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War the area that is today Palm City was part of Rancho La Punta, sometimes referred to as Rancho Melijo, granted to Santiago Emilio Arguello in 1834. The U.S. Land Commission rejected his claim, opening up the area to settlement; which in turn led to the creation of communities in the area. In the 1880s, John J. Montgomery built and designed his own ornithopters and manned glider designs at the Montgomery family Fruitland Ranch near what would become Palm City. His gliders were tested on the surrounding hillsides of Otay Mesa. These flights represented the first of their kind in the nation.Harwood, Craig S. and Fogel, Gary B. Quest for Flight: John J. Montgomery and the Dawn of Aviation in the West, University of Oklahoma Press 2012. Palm City was established in 1914, and named for the palms lining Palm Avenue. Indeed, the original name for the area was \\"Palm Avenue\\", until the post office declared that name unsuitable.Stein, Lou, \\"San Diego County Place-Names\\", Rand Editions-Tofua Press, 1975. That same year, the county opened up a library branch to serve the community. Even a year before it was established, it was the terminus of a small railway, the Mexico & San Diego Railway, that ran to Imperial Beach, and operated two cars. During the 1916 Hatfield flood, the community was temporarily cut off from San Diego, when the waters from the Lower Otay Lake broke through the Lower Otay Dam, and washed away the San Diego & Arizona Railway's bridge over the Otay River. In 1926, the community was all of 250 persons. Prior to the internment during World War II, the city was home to the Iguchi brothers, who farmed seventy acres in the community. By 1942, the community had grown to a population of 720. With the end of World War II, the community became population concentration area for returning Japanese Americans. Beginning in 1952 the community maintained its own sanitation district; it was annexed by the city in 1963. Palm City, along with other portions of South San Diego, was annexed from San Diego County in 1957. In 1983, the community experienced damage due to an earthquake, 4.6 on the Richter scale, that occurred ten miles off the coast, in the Pacific Ocean. It was stated by the California Institute of Technology at the time to be the \\"largest quake to hit San Diego since 1932.\\"< In 2004, using DNA evidence, a convicted felon rapist was found to be responsible for the torture and killing of two boys who went missing in Palm City, near the Otay River, in 1993. He had previously been convicted of a rape that occurred seven months after he had murdered the minors. The felon was sentenced to death, and is housed at San Quentin State Prison. =Camp Lawrence J. Hearn= Beginning in 1916, the Third Oregon Infantry established the post during its border service. The United States Army, maintained Camp Lawrence J. Hearn, in honor of Major Hearn of the 21st Infantry Regiment, in response to the Mexican Civil War, and was manned by the 1st Cavalry Regiment. It was abandoned in August 1920, but re- established by the 11th Cavalry Regiment in October of that same year. Brigadier General F.C. Marshall visited the post just before he died in a plane crash, traveling to Tucson, Arizona. Until 1921, the post had no structures, and consisted of a tent cantonment; soldiers requiring medical care would be sent to Fort Rosecrans for treatment. However, conditions on the post did not improve significantly, and was described by Army Chief of Staff Major General Summerall as being like a \\"logging camp\\", composed of \\"tumbledown shacks\\". In 1924, cavalrymen from the post assisted local officers, and federal agents in enforcing a 9 P.M. curfew at the international border crossing. It continued to be in use until it was abandoned in 1931. Later the former post was considered by the Coastal Artillery Corps for the site of a battery, however this was never built. Facilities and landmarks Palm City is home to two shopping centers, as well as Sunnyslope Park. The community is served by the San Diego Trolley's blue line that has a station within its boundaries. Several landmarks to John J. Montgomery are in the area including Silverwing Park, and the John J. Montgomery Freeway, a portion of Interstate 5.

Rivalry for the imamate Al-Mutahhar bin Muhammad was no immediate relative of the family that had provided imams for the last three generations. He was a descendant of the grand organizer of Zaydiyyah Islam, al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860), in the 14th degree.The filiation is: al-Qasim ar- Rassi - al-Husayn - Abdallah - Yahya - Abd ar-Rahman - al-Husayn - Muhammad - Muhammad - Ali - Hamzah - al-Husayn - Yahya - Sulayman - Muhammad - al- Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar. See Carl Brockelmann, Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur, Vol. I. Leiden 1943, p. 231. When the old imam al-Mansur Ali died of the plague that ravaged Yemen in 1436, he was one of three candidates who brought forward their da'wa (call for the imamate). He took the honorific title al-Mutawakkil al-Mutahhar. The two other claimants were al-Mahdi Salah ad-Din (d. 1445) and al-Mansur an-Nasir (d. 1462). Of these, al-Mansur initially became the dominant, and imprisoned his two rivals. While al-Mahdi died in captivity, al-Mutawakkil was released by his captor after some time.Imam Zaid bin Ali Cultural Foundation, .http://www.izbacf.org/page_display.php?book_id=37&page;_num=51 (in Arabic). In spite of the internal political disunity, the Zaidi community was relatively safe for incursions from the Sunni lowland of Yemen. The once powerful Rasulid Dynasty declined rapidly and collapsed altogether in 1442-1454. A new lowland power, the Tahiride Dynasty, took over in 1454. They did what they could to discomfort the Zaidi state from the beginning. Territorial losses After some skirmishing, the Tahiride Sultan Ali temporarily took Dhamar in 1460. In the following year, Ali managed to seize San'a with the help of a Zaidi rebel, expelling al-Mutawakkil from the city.R.B. Serjeant & R. Lewcock, San'a'; An Arabian Islamic City. London 1983, p. 67. A son of the imam was set up as fief-holder, exerting power together with the Tahiride governor al-Ba'dani.

Labor leaders have often cited the warfare at the giant plumbing supply company in their contention that workers need unions. Industrial leaders have pointed to the strikes as examples of union belligerence and indifference toward the true welfare of their employees. Strike of 1934 The Kohler Company was founded in Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1873, when John Michael Kohler II (1844‚Äì1900) took over his father-in-law's steel and iron factory. During the late 19th century it prospered as the producer of plumbing products and enamelware. In 1912, land around a new factory just west of Sheboygan became the Village of Kohler, Wisconsin. From 1905 until his death, John Michael's son Walter J. Kohler, Sr. (1875‚Äì1940) led the highly successful business. In the early 1920s, he built a family mansion, Riverbend, and was welcomed in high society in Chicago and elsewhere. In 1928, he became Governor of Wisconsin for a single term. With the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act by Congress in June of 1933 that gave the employees the right to have a union, Kohler followed the lead of many industrialists and created a workers association that he could control to forestall the creation of an independent union. Although this association handled minor shop floor grievances they never negotiated contracts with the company instead they accepted the company‚Äôs offer. In August of 1933 the workers at Kohler applied for and received a charter from the American Federation of Labor for a union. It was christened Federal Labor Union No. 18545. On October 4, 1933, November 21, 1933, and November 28, 1933 meetings were held between Local 18545 members and the Kohler executives, but nothing was accomplished. On June 22, 1934 the union presented Kohler management with a 14 point proposal with the first item being recognition of their union. Four days later the company announced the shutdown of the entire plant. It had been the Kohler custom to shut down the plant for a couple of days around the 4th of July holiday and sponsor a picnic for all employees, but this shutdown came without warning and was termed indefinite. Workers were told they would be called back as necessary. Once again when presented with the union asserting itself, the Kohler Company, now with Walter Kohler at its head, chose to demonstrate to the employees who owned the company and that he would not be bargained with. Violence quickly erupted and the entire Village was closed to traffic. Special deputies hired by the company clashed with pickets, and huge crowds began to assemble. On July 27, purportedly in response to vandalism against company property, the special deputies attacked with guns and tear gas. Two strikers named Lee Wakefield and Harry Englemann were killed, and 47 \\"men, women and boys were wounded, gassed, and injured\\". On July 29, in response to appeals by Walter and the local sheriff, 250 members of the National Guard arrived on the scene. Walter, who had been trapped in the main office building for 12 days, blamed the violence on outsiders and people with \\"communistic affiliations.\\" In September, the National Labor Relations Board ruled against the Kohler Company and demanded secret, supervised elections at the plant to determine who would represent the workers, which the company union won. The Kohler victory was short-lived, however, for in 1935 the US Supreme Court declared the National Industrial Recovery Act unconstitutional. Congress soon, however, passed the Wagner Act, giving organized labor the right to organize and bargain collectively without employer interference. A majority of workers could now determine who would represent them; this \\"union shop\\" was the chief goal of the AFL. Still, the company union and the principle of \\"open shop\\" remained in effect at the Kohler Company until 1952, when the United Auto Workers (UAW) won an election. Strike of 1954 During the Second World War, Herbert V. Kohler, Sr. (1891‚Äì1968) gained control of the Kohler Company. He was a physically and mentally powerful man best known for his supreme self-confidence and iron will. He had played a key role in the strike of 1934 and was a staunch opponent of organized labor. The United Auto Workers Local 833 was determined to organize Kohler employees, and it won a certified election in 1952. Herbert V. Kohler refused to grant union demands during contract negotiations, and a strike began on April 5, 1954. Some 2,800 of the Company's 3,300 employees joined the picket lines. The plant essentially ceased operations for two months. Herbert then resumed production with non-union labor. Six years of sporadic violence ensued between strikers and strike breakers. In time, the company would charge opponents with more than a thousand acts of vandalism. At one point, more than 300 people were arrested. Calls for a national boycott of Kohler products were vociferous and sometimes effective, and UAW provided $12 million to strikes over the years. Herbert resisted all efforts to compromise, even sharply rejecting a public appeal from his nephew, Governor Walter J. Kohler, Jr.. In 1960, the National Labor Relations Board decided against the Kohler Company, ruling that it had refused to bargain in good faith after the strike broke out. Herbert was ordered to reinstate 1,700 workers. It took lawsuits by both sides and two more years for management and labor to work out a contract. The bitter issue of compensation for strikers remained unresolved. In December 1965, the Kohler Company agreed to pay $3 million in back wages to some 1,400 former employees and hand over $1.5 million in pension-fund contributions. The union agreed to make no further charges stemming from the strike. The longest major strike in American history had ended.Thomas C.

Kohler, Jr. (1939-) headed the family-owned company and took a more positive approach to labor relations. In 2002, for example, a five-year labor contract was signed.http://www.kohler.com/pr/news/contract.html However, the long and often bloody struggle scarred thousands of lives throughout the Sheboygan-Kohler area and elsewhere for more than three decades. Strike of 1983 The third strike, which occurred in 1983 and lasted 16 days, saw car windows smashed by demonstrators and two union members injured by a motorist who drove his vehicle through a picket line. Strike of 2015 On November 15, 2015, 94% of the UAW Union Local 833 membership rejected the contract proposal and voted to strike. The strike, the first at the company since 1983, was declared after paper-ballot voting by an estimated 1,800 union members attending a meeting at Sheboygan South High School. At issue is a two-tiered employee system that was established in 2010.

It existed between 1938 and 1945. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onwards, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. On 12 March 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria and on 24 May the Austrian provinces were reorganized and replaced by seven Nazi party Gaue.\\"Administration of Austria,\\" The Times (London) 25 May 1938, page 15. Under the Ostmarkgesetz law of 14 April 1939 with effect of 1 May, the Austrian Gaue were raised to the status of Reichsgaue and their Gauleiters were subsequently also named Reichsstatthalters. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War. Local Gauleiters were in charge of propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onwards, the Volkssturm and the defence of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in Salzburg was initially held by Friedrich Rainer until 27 November 1941, and then by Gustav Adolf Scheel, while Anton Wintersteiger held the office of Deputy Gauleiter throughout the Reichsgau's history from 1938 to 1945.

Regulatory bodies employing such principles in the US include for example the FDA for food and medical products, the EPA for the environment, and OSHA for work safety. \\"Regulatory science\\" is contrasted with regulatory affairs and regulatory law, which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation, in that the former is focused on the regulations' scientific underpinnings and concerns ‚Äì rather than the regulations' promulgation, implementation, compliance, or enforcement. History Probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was Alvin Weinberg who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science. The origin of the term regulatory science is unknown. It was probably coined sometimes in the late 1970s in an undated memorandum prepared by A. Alan Moghissi who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was facing. During that period the EPA was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements. At that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new scientific discipline because ‚Äúscience is science‚Äù regardless of how its application. In the spring of 1985 Moghissi established the Institute for Regulatory Science in the Commonwealth of Virginia as a non-profit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies ‚Äúat the interface between science and the regulatory system‚Äù Moghissi et al. have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the FDA Definition Moghissi et al. have described the history of regulatory science and provide two definitions. The first definition is the generalized definition provided by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ‚ÄúRegulatory science is a scientific discipline consisting of the development and application of scientific methods, tools, approaches, and other relevant processes derived from various scientific disciplines used to support regulatory and other policy objectives‚Äù. An abbreviated definition consists of ‚Äúregulatory science consists of the application of science to support policy notably regulatory objectives‚Äù The objectives, stated by the FDA in 2010 will provide a basis to: * Improve capacity for safety and efficacy evaluations and monitoring of candidate and licensed products, * Modernize current regulatory pathways, * Develop new regulatory pathways where there are currently none. There have been several attempts to define regulatory science. In many cases there are claims that there is a difference between regulatory science and ‚Äúnormal science‚Äù, ‚Äúacademic science‚Äù, ‚Äúresearch science‚Äù. or compliance with regulations The primary problem is the lack of appreciation that many branches of science are evolving and much of the evolving science includes inherent uncertainties. Application of regulatory science Regulatory science is included in every regulation that includes science. The regulatory science community consists of three groups of regulatory scientists: *Those who are involved in development of regulations. Typically this group is employed by regulatory agencies *Those who must comply with regulations. Typically this group consists of employees or contractors of regulated community. *Those segments of the scientific community who perform research and development in areas relevant to the relevant regulated community. The third group is of particular significance as they consist of organizations and individuals who support the first two groups. Included in this group are members of numerous advisory panels, organizations that provide peer reviews, and members of peer review panels. An example of this group is the National Academies consisting of the National Academy of Science, National Academy of Engineering, Institute of Medicine, and National Research Council. The application of regulatory science occurs in three phases. During the first phase the regulators must meet a legislative or court- mandated deadline and promulgate regulations using their best judgment. The second phase provides opportunity to develop regulatory science tools. These include human health and ecological risk assessment procedures and post marketing evaluation method d processes for drugs ad medical devices. The third Standard Operating phase, used tools developed during the second phase to improve the initial decision. (Moghissi et al.) Regulatory engineering Engineering is the development of new products and processes, hence regulatory engineering encompasses principally the development of products and processes to facilitate or better examine regulations or their scientific foundations. Another related segment of regulatory science deal with the application of engineering design or analysis to operations such as the safety of nuclear and other power plants, chemical production facilities, mining operations, and air transportation. Sometimes the term \\"regulatory engineer(ing)\\" is misused to refer to essentially administrative or regulatory roles dealing with organizing or coordinating regulatory matters for an organization; however, \\"engineering\\" refers only to functional design of products and processes, and in many jurisdictions this definition is legally enforced (see Regulation and licensure in engineering). Areas of focus =Regulatory pharmaceutical medicine= Consistent with its mission, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) suggests that ‚ÄúRegulatory science is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality and performance of FDA-regulated products.‚Äù Based on several decades of experience regulatory science is logically defined as a distinct scientific discipline constituting the scientific foundation of regulatory, legislative, and judicial decisions. Much like many scientific disciplines that have evolved within the last several decades, regulatory science is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary and relies upon a large number of basic and applied scientific disciplines. Regulatory science is an emerging area of interest within pharmaceutical medicine as the shaping and implementation of legislation and guidelines. One definition of ‚Äúregulatory science‚Äù is the science of developing new tools, standards and approaches to evaluate the efficacy, safety, quality and performance of medical products in order to assess benefit-risk and facilitate a sound and transparent regulatory decision-making. It has been recognized as having a significant impact on the industry‚Äôs ability to bring new medicines and medical devices to patients in need. Regulatory science challenges current concepts of benefit/risk assessment, submission and approval strategies, patient‚Äôs involvement and ethical aspects. It creates the platform for launching new ideas ‚Äì not only by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities, but also by, for example, academia, who wants to contribute to better use of their research activities within medical aspects. Regulatory science has the potential as an enabler for directing companies towards more efficient global development of medical products as well as more robust quality decision-making processes. =Human health= By far the predominant foci of Regulatory Science pertain to human health and well-being. This realm covers a broad range of scientific areas ‚Äì including pollution and toxicology, work safety, food, drugs, and numerous others. =Ecology= Regulatory ecology covers resources the protection of various species, protection of wetlands, and numerous other regulated areas including ecotoxicology. For example, the US Clean Water Act is based upon an interest in protecting water quality for its own sake, in contrast with the Clean Air Act which is premised upon protecting air quality only for the sake of human health; however, these are ideological policy premises rather than scientific matters themselves. The US Department of Agriculture regulates animal care, and the FDA regulates humaneness for animal studies. The US Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service, implement the development and enforcement of policies required by the Federal Endangered Species Act (FESA), Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and other biological resources laws. The FESA requires that the decisions to list a species as endangered or threatened are based on the best available scientific data. To that end, the USFWS, and other government agencies fund research to determine the conservation status of proposed species. Regulatory scientists within the Services review, evaluate, and incorporate data from these studies of proposed species in their published regulations. Survey protocols for listed species are also developed from scientific studies of their target species. The purpose of the protocols is to reliably and accurately determine the residency of the target species in a given study area. Regulatory economics There are numerous economic decisions in the regulatory process including the economics part of cost-benefit analysis. Science in legislation and in courts Although often less than fully recognized the scientific foundation of legislative decisions are included in regulatory science and should be based on reliable science. Similarly courts have recognized the need to rely upon information that meets scientific requirements. References . .

He is the chairman of the Rockland County Board of Health. Education and early life Oppenheim received his undergraduate degree in Neuroscience from Princeton University in 1984, finishing his thesis under the mentorship of George Armitage Miller, graduating summa cum laude. He graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1988 with an M.D. with Honors in research. From 1988 to 1994 he was a neurosurgeon at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, serving as chief resident from 1993 to 1994. His father was a chairman and the chief executive officer of Joyce International, a furniture company in New York, and his mother, Joyce Oppenheim, was a sculptor. He became Board Certified by the American Board of Neurological Surgeons in 1996. Awards and distinctions Distinguished Service Award, from the Legislature of Rockland County, September, 2010. Chief, Section of Neurosurgery, Good Samaritan Hospital, Suffern, York. HealthGrades recognized the spine program at Good Samaritan Hospital, under Oppenheim's leadership, with its highest rating: 5 stars. Oppenheim's publications have included a case report describing the first case of a spinal cord bypass that facilitated partial recovery from a spinal cord transection, using a peripheral nerve transfer. Oppenheim's account of the history of neurosurgery at Mt. Sinai Hospital has been adapted by several authors.http://www.mssm.edu/departments-and-institutes/neurosurgery/about- us/history Political interest Oppenheim was elected to the board of trustees in the Village of Montebello in 2003. The grassroots local political party he founded, Preserve Montebello, took majority control of the board of trustees in 2005. In 2007 he was elected mayor of the village. He is the second mayor in the history of the village, which was incorporated in 1986. Under the Mayor's leadership the village has become active and engaged in historic preservation, open-space acquisition, tree preservation, and has encouraged the use of renewable energy sources. The village was the first municipality in Rockland County to be recognized as a \\"Climate Smart Community\\" by the NYS DEC., as a \\"Tree City\\" by the Arbor Day Foundation and the USDA., and a Historic \\"Certified Local Government\\" by National Park Service and New York State. He has led the village in the acquisition of a community center, the dedication of several parks, the installation of solar electric panels to serve municipal facilities, a review of the village's comprehensive plan, the renovation of Village Hall, and a reduction in the size of the budget. He instituted a regular newsletter, broadcast of Board meetings on television, and open public comment at the beginning and end of every meeting. Oppenheim instituted the first of its kind traffic calming program which allows citizens to petition the Board for the installation of speed humps on public roads. In the first 4 years of this program, speed humps were installed on three streets. Taxes in the Village of Montebello, having the lowest rate of any village in the town of Ramapo, were not raised in either 2010, 2011 or 2013. Oppenheim serves as the president of the Rockland County Board of Health. In this capacity, he lobbied the county legislature for a local law prohibiting cigarette smoking in cars when children are present. The law was unanimously passed by the legislature and signed into law by the county executive in 2007. Oppenheim was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 2012 In 2013 he was named \\"Businessman of the Year\\" by the Rockland County Republican Party. Philanthropic interest From 2004 to 2009, Oppenheim served on the board of trustees of Good Samaritan Hospital. During his tenure the hospital established an open heart surgical program.

Life Born at Winchester in 1645, he was the second son of Bartholomew and Frances Smith of Stoke Charity. Smith was educated at the English College, Douai, and was created D.D. on 5 February 1680. He was appointed President of Douai College, in succession to Francis Gage, on 28 August 1682, and while in that post he inherited a large estate from his father (most of which he granted to a younger brother). In 1687 he was nominated by James II to be one of the four vicars-apostolic of England, each of whom had an annual stipend of ¬£1,000. He was elected by the Propaganda Fide on 12 January 1687, and was consecrated at Somerset House on 13 May 1688 as titular bishop of Calliopolis. Brady, William Maziere. \\"James Smith\\", Annals of the Catholic Hierarchy in England and Scotland, J. M. Stark, 1883, p. 243 After his consecration he went to his vicariate, arriving on 2 August at York, where he was received by the secular and regular clergy, who sang the Te Deum. In one of his visitations Smith was deprived of his large crozier by Thomas Osborne, Earl of Danby, who deposited it in York Minster. On the flight of the king, Smith left York and sought refuge in the house of Francis Tunstall of Wycliffe, who gave him hospitality and protection till the time of his death. At different times, Smith assumed the aliases of Brown, Harper, and Tarlton to avoid the penal laws. In 1700 it was contemplated that he should be promoted to the cardinalate and to the office of Protector of England, which had been vacant since the death of Cardinal Howard; the Duke of Berwick and Dr. George Witham were commissioned from St. Germain to solicit this appointment from Clement XI. Upon the death of John Leyburn in 1702, Smith was solicited for the London District, but expressed his reluctance to accept and recommended instead Bonaventure Giffard. Smith died at Wycliffe on 13 May 1711 at the age of 66. Silvester Jenks was appointed to succeed Smith as Vicar Apostolic of the Northern District, but died before his consecration.

It is one of the largest known complexes of prehistoric flint mines in Europe together with Grimes Graves in England and Spiennes in Belgium.Sa≈Çaci≈Ñski S. & Zalewski M., 1987: Krzemionki. Wydawnictwa Geologiczne, page 9. The flint mining in Krzemionki began about 3900 BC and lasted until about 1600 BC. During Neolithic times the mine was used by members of the Funnelbeaker culture who spread the flint mining area far up to 300 km. The Globular Amphora Culture also used the pits and even more intensely, enlarging the area of exploration to about 500 km. The site is a Polish historic monument, as designated October 16, 1994. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland. On 6 July 2019, the Krzemionki Prehistoric Striped Flint Mining Region was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History of mining A reconstructed Neolithic settlement above the mine The mining area is 4.5 km long and 25‚Äì180 m wide, covering an area of 78.5 ha.http://www.en.krzemionki.pl/index_x.php?krzem=kopalnie There are more than 4000 mine shafts known with depths of 9 meters deep with wells measuring from four to twelve metres in diameter. Some of the shafts are connected by short horizontal passage for the purposes of access or drainage called adits. They are 55 ‚Äì 120 cm in height covering an area of about 4.5 km. Rare Neolithic pictures are engraved on the walls of some of these adits.Sa≈Çaci≈Ñski S. & Zalewski M., 1987: Krzemionki. Wydawnictwa Geologiczne. The flint at Krzemionki was exploited from the 4th millennium through the middle of the 2nd millennium BCE (3000-1600 BCE.) by people of the Linearbandkeramik, Globular Amphora and Mierzanowice cultures who excavated flint mainly by hatchets. Banded flints from Krzemionki were used mainly for the manufacture of axes and chisels. Abundant quantities of these tools were traded as far away as 660 km from the Krzemionki mines. The main period of the mines' exploitation was 2500-2000 BCE. Flint mining at Krzemionki began to decline beginning in 1800-1600 BCE. In following centuries, the Krzemionki mining district was only sporadically visited. The village near the mines was mentioned first historically in 1509 and was owned by a man named Jakub from Szyd≈Çowiec. The area's numerous small limestone quarries were used for lime production during the first half of the 20th century. History of scientific investigations and tourism The mines were discovered in 1922 by geologist Jan Samsonowicz. Archaeological investigations headed by archaeologist Stefan Krukowski began in 1923. After the Second World War, the head of the scientific team was Tadeusz ≈ªurowski who explored the mines in Krzemionki, especially in 1958 - 1961. In 1967, the Krzemionki mines were designated an archaeological reserve and, in 1995, a natural reserve. Small groups of tourists have visited the Krzemionki mines since the late 1950s. The mines were opened to large-scale tourism on 11 June 1985 (so-called Tourist Route No. 1). On 10 June 1990 a second underground tourist route was opened and an open-air archaeological museum was dedicated in 1992.http://www.en.krzemionki.pl/index_x.php?krzem=obiekt&st;=2&id;=6 The underground tourist route is 465 m long and is 11.5 m deep at its deepest point.

Background and education Born in Hong Kong in 1929, Sanger was the daughter of Richard Sanger (1894‚Äì1957) and Lonni Wheeler, n√©e Wernicke (1891‚Äì1987). Her father was a sales executive for Standard Oil of California posted in the Orient for almost 30 years. Her mother was a native of Berlin, Germany. In Hong Kong, Sanger attended the Peak School, and later the British Central School. When the family was at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts she attended what is now the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School. In 1950 Sanger graduated Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude from Smith College, with a degree in Government. In 1952 she completed post-graduate work at the Russian Institute (now The Harriman Institute), at Columbia University.NY Times Obituary, March 8, 1993 Early career From 1957-60, Sanger was the Manager of Public Affairs, at Station WNBC-TV, New York City. She told the New York Times later that \\"'the only place women were allowed then was in Religious Programming,' noting that when she quit as WNBC's manager of Public Affairs in 1961 she was replaced in the job by two men each making twice as much as she had.\\" During the same period, she was also the Associate Producer (1957‚Äì1960) and Producer (1960‚Äì1963) of The Open Mind, Richard Heffner's award winning series that celebrated its 50th year on the air in 2006. In 1966, Sanger went into Sports as the Manager of Client Relations and Associate Producer for ABC Sports where she stayed until 1970‚Äîwith a stint as a writer on ABC News in 1967.

This assignment began in 1974 with a focus on women in sports, including a $200,000 prime-time Women's Sports special sponsored by Colgate, narrated by Dinah Shore, featuring Billie Jean King, Olga Korbut, jockey Robin Smyth and The Princess Anne. Sanger's association with women's sports continued, including her mentoring of other women in the business, passing along her belief that you could succeed without imitating your male counterparts. Interviewed in 1974 by the New York Times, Sanger's closing quote was \\"I'll leave the football games to the guys,\\" she said, \\"They do them fine.\\" She had it wrong, eventually winning an Emmy Award for her coverage of NCAA football in 1988. In fact during her ABC career there wasn't a sport, played by men or women, (including the Scottish Highland Games) that Sanger didn't produce. In addition, Sanger's trips to China and North Korea covering ping pong tournaments, made her a unique academic resource on how the Western media was treated early on. Emmy Award-winning Olympic Games Sanger received six Emmy Awards, for her work as Producer on the Winter and Summer Olympics: 1968 ‚Äì Grenoble, France and Mexico City, Mexico; 1976, Innsbruck, Austria and Montreal, Canada; 1984 ‚Äì Sarajevo, Yugoslavia and Los Angeles, California.

Designed as a tourer and trainer, all Aliz√©s served as training aircraft for government (Republican) forces during the Spanish Civil War. Design and development The Aliz√© (Tradewind in English) was designed in 1936 as a tourer/trainer, though in the end it served almost entirely as a trainer. Its flat sided, round decked fuselage seated two in open, tandem cockpits, fitted from the outset with dual control. The rear cockpit was at the trailing edge of the parasol wing, which had a small cut-out for improved visibility; the forward cockpit was under the wing. The wing itself was of parallel chord with rounded tips. Like the rest of the Aliz√©, it had a wooden structure. Two pairs of parallel struts joined the wing to the lower fuselage longerons, assisted by vertical ancillary struts outboard and a cabane structure with two main struts per side, another pair of thinner struts going forward to the upper rear engine mounting. Both vertical and horizontal tail surfaces were straight edged and nearly rectangular. The rudder operated in a cut-out between the elevators, carried on the strut braced stabilizers. The Aliz√© had a fixed, split axle conventional undercarriage. The main undercarriage legs, each carrying a single mainwheel, were mounted vertically on the forward wing struts, with half-axles hinged from the centre line of the fuselage bottom. Secondary struts ran forward from the top and bottom of each leg to points on the rear of the engine mounting. The Aliz√© was powered by an uncowled 110 hp (82 kW) Lorraine 5P engine, a five-cylinder radial. It had a long exhaust pipe reaching under the aircraft rearwards, passing between the radius arms and ending below the forward cockpit. The first flight was in May 1936. The first prototype completed its certification tests in late September 1936 and received its certificate in December. The second prototype was certified the same day; ten more Aliz√©s, already built in the Boulogne-Billancourt factory were also approved the following day. Operational history The history of the Aliz√© was determined by events not in France but in neighbouring Spain, where a military backed rebellion against the government had broken out in July 1936, beginning the Spanish Civil War. Since the military controlled the bulk of the Spanish Air Force's equipment, the government had to look abroad for replacement aircraft. France was, after some wavering, unwilling to provide true military machines but was prepared to turn a blind eye to the export of civil French aircraft that might have military potential, so long as this was done quietly. Some 50 French civil aircraft went to Spain this way, including all 12 Aliz√©s. By June 1937 they were serving as trainers at three pilot schools across Spain.

As a child she suffered through near starvation food rationing and a controlling male dominated Japanese society. For example, when she received a Fulbright Scholarship to study in the United States and asked her father to pay for the trip he said that he would rather spend the money on a new horse than waste it on an education for a female. Encouraged by her mother's wishes for a better life and through determination she went after her own independence.First Marathons: Personal Encounters with the 26.2-Mile Monster By Gail Kislevitz P90 She met an orphaned deaf boy at a Catholic convent in Kyoto and from that developed a passion for educating the deaf. After graduating from Tsuda College in Tokyo, she could find no Special Education training available in post World War II Japan and came to Syracuse University in 1951 as a Fulbright Scholar. She had a brief marriage to an American, that left her as a single mother in 1955. When she tried to return to Japan with her child her father said that she had disgraced the family and must put her daughter up for adoption, but her mother gave her money to return to the U.S. and start a new life. Staying in the U.S. she met and married Italian-American pianist Manfred D'Elia, who had a passion for mountain climbing, and settled in Ridgewood, New Jersey. Running career On a climb of Mount Rainier she suffered from altitude sickness and failed to finish the climb. After that, she began to run a mile a day with her daughter, Erica, who in 1974 was part of the first cross country team at Ridgewood High School.Japan-born running phenom Toshiko D'Elia in form at 77  The Japan Times Following the publicity of Katherine Switzer's 1970 incident at the Boston Marathon, women's athletics were a new phenomenon. Women were just beginning to explore their limits in running. > Sometimes, ignorance was bliss. You don't know what you're in for. This period was also the beginning of the running boom of the 1970s. Another Japanese-American whom D'Elia admired, Miki Gorman, had won the Boston Marathon in 1974. Saying \\"26 miles is for horses to run, not people,\\" D'Elia ran her first full marathon \\"by accident\\" at the Jersey Shore Marathon. On a freezing day when she intended to quit at , but her support didn't show up with a change of clothing, so she kept running to the finish. Her time of 3:25 qualified her to run the Boston Marathon in 1976 where at the age of 46, she was the second recorded Masters female runner (after Sylvia Weiner) in the history of the event, finishing in 3:16:56 on a notoriously hot day. As a form of seeking support for other New Jersey area runners, she and her husband formed the North Jersey Masters Track and Field Club.Toshi d'Elia headlines honorees at NJ Masters banquet - NorthJersey.comRidgewood Run :: History The following year, she ran 3:04:56, in 1978 she ran 3:04:26BAA Marathon Results and broke 3 hours for the first time with a 2:58:11 at age 49. Each of those won the Masters division. Later in 1979, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer, but still ran Boston in April 1980, doing 3:09:07 just 4 months after surgery. She was interviewed by a Japanese reporter after this run and was invited to speak at the Women's World Sports Symposium in Tokyo, which she did. In 1980, she became the first 50-year-old woman to run under 3 hours for the marathon at the World Veteran's Marathon Champions in Glasgow, Scotland, finishing in 2:57:25. For this she received the Runner's World Magazine's Paavo Nurmi Award. D'Elia became the first woman over 65 to run a sub seven- minute mile indoors. In 1996 she was inducted into the first class of the Masters division of the USATF National Track and Field Hall of Fame. D'Elia was the top runner at New York Road Runner races throughout the '70s, '80s, and '90s. She was nominated for the New York Road Runners Runner of the Year award an unprecedented 30 times, winning it 27 times. She has been featured in Sports Illustrated, and is part of a permanent exhibit on running legends at the New Balance Armory in Washington Heights, NY.

Grant Company. Starting in 1935, Thermos employed a clipping service to find unauthorized usages and protested to dictionary editors who included thermos as a word rather than a proper name. A 1940 internal memo said the definitions \\"undoubtedly would be cited against us in a lawsuit to defend the trademark. The best we can do is to try to 'purify' the definition of the word.\\" Into the 1950s, Thermos continued its efforts to protect it, creating various products (tents, lanterns, campstoves) bearing the name to affirm it as a brand name, not an item. In 1958, Aladdin Industries announced intent to sell \\"thermos bottles\\", and the Thermos trademark holder (then named the King-Seeley Thermos Company) sued for infringement. In 1962, Judge Robert Anderson ruled that thermos was a generic term, due largely to Thermos's own publicization and lack of diligence in defending the trademark. Aladdin (or any company) could mark its bottles with a lowercase \\"thermos\\", while the Thermos company retained the uppercase usage.Thermos Company profile, from ReferenceForBusiness.com This decision rendered the trademark partially genericized in the US Second Circuit (New York, Connecticut, and Vermont), but it remains a registered trademark in the rest of the US, and in over 100 other countries.. It is unclear what the Thermos website really means by the strange expression \\"in over 115 countries\\"; it could suggest \\"exactly 116\\", or that whoever put together the website materials wasn't certain of the true number and stopped counting at 115. History In 1892, James Dewar, a scientist at Cambridge University, invented the vacuum-insulated flask, a scientific vessel for storing liquified gases. It was not a household item fit for everyday use like carrying warm coffee. In 1903, the German glass blower Reinhold Burger got a German patent for an isolating vessel fit for everyday use. In 1904, Reinhold Burger registered the trademark Thermos for his patent. In 1906, the company Thermos GmbH was formed by Burger with Albert Aschenbrenner and Gustav Robert Paalen. The production of Thermos-branded bottles in the United States was based on US patent 13,093 by Burger and Aschenbrenner. The vacuum flask is today commonly called the Dewar flask among chemists in recognition of its inventor, though he did not register a patent or trademark for his invention. When Burger and Thermos GmbH did so, Dewar sued, but lost his court case to claim intellectual property rights to the invention. Norwich production plant The citizens of Norwich, Connecticut, sought out the Thermos company to build and operate a plant on the banks of the Thames River. A group of citizens under the group \\"Norwich Boomers\\" rallied the community to purchase 27 acres of land for $750 an acre so that it could be used for the Thermos. The house of Dr. William H. Mason was also on the property, and it was also a part of the purchase. The Italianate house was converted to be used as an office building.. See also . Together, the citizens and the city raised $78,000. A contract was signed on February 14, 1912, it would make Norwich the home of the Thermos Plant and that Thermos would use Norwich's name on its advertising. Allyn L. Brown acted as attorney and provided counsel for the deal. Thermos products produced in Norwich bear a stamp \\"Made in Norwich\\". The construction of the plant was a boon for Norwich, which helped the employment of the area after the decline of the textile industry. The operations expanded into nearby Taftville, Connecticut and together the plants were active until they were phased out and shut down in 1988. The Norwich site was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Expansion In 1955, the Thermos company, then named the American Thermos Bottle Company, acquired control of Hemp and Company, Inc., of Macomb, Illinois, manufacturers of the Little Brown Jug and other insulated jugs and chests, as well as Duncan Hines-branded outdoor grills. To reflect the growing diversity of products, the names of the North American companies were changed again in 1956; the US corporation became the American Thermos Products Company, while what had been the Canadian Thermos Bottle Co. Ltd. changed its name to Canadian Thermos Products Limited.  Historical importance  Thermos products made a major impact in the 1950s and sold over 2 million units. In 2004, the Smithsonian Institution museum featured Thermos products as part of its \\"Taking America to Lunch\\" retrospective of lunch kits from the 1880s to the 1980s.

In 2004, Givot Olam declared to have made it commercially viable to drill. It is one of the largest on-shore oil fields in Israel. It began production in 2010 and produces oil as well as some natural gas. Its proven oil reserves are about . Overview The Meged oil field is located near the towns of Kfar Saba and Rosh Ha'Ayin in Israel. It is situated close to the southern tip of the Palmyra rift system, a geological formation that extends across Syria to the northeast. Givot Olam, which owns and operates the Meged license, first announced its discovery of the Meged field in April 2004. The field spans 200 square kilometers. *Meged 2. In 1998 the partnership announced that in the course of tests it was conducting at the Meged 2 bore, unidentified fluids accompanied by gas gushed out of the bore at a rate of 400 barrels a day. Meged 2 was abandoned in the years following. *Meged 3. In 2000, after earlier having said it had found significant quantities of natural gas at the Meged 3 prospect, Givot announced a halt of drilling operations there on account of a technical failure. When the technical failure was resolved and drilling operations resumed, Givot announced that Meged 3 would be abandoned as the natural gas was not available in commercial quantities. *Meged 4. After an exploratory drilling at the Meged 4 well in 1994 had failed to turn up oil in commercial quantities, in 2003 Givot Olam reported that tests it was conducting at Meged 4 indicated the presence of oil and gas 4,400 meters below the surface. 64 barrels of oil were recovered from the borehole before Givot announced in 2005 that it was discontinuing drilling operations after test results indicated that there was not enough oil to make development commercially viable. *Meged 5. In 2009 the partnership announced that it had found indications of significant quantities of oil at its Meged 5 site. In mid-2011 Givot reported that Meged 5 was producing oil at a rate of 800 barrels a day. The Meged 5 well is located on land designated a training zone by the Israel Defense Forces. *Meged 6. On June 19, 2013 the partnership announced that it had started drilling the Meged-6 oil well. In early January 2012, Givot Olam reported that the state had rejected the company's proposal to drill at Meged wells 6, 7 and 8. Later in the month Givot reported that it had obtained approval to proceed with drilling operations at Meged wells 5, 6 and 14. Agreements In 2010, Givot Olam sold 240 barrels of oil obtained from Meged 5 to Oil Refineries Ltd (BAZAN), an Israeli oil refining company. During the first quarter of 2011 Givot sold NIS4.6 million worth of crude oil extracted from the Meged field to refineries. An agreement signed between Givot Olam and Natural Gas for Israel Ltd. (GTL) in March 2012 stipulated that the former would supply natural gas to GTL from the Meged 5 well for a period of three years in exchange for $4.4 million, beginning in 2013. Religion Givot Olam founder Tovia Luskin was drawn to the Meged site after interpreting a geological survey of the area in 1988 as confirming a biblical passage in the Book of Deuteronomy (33:15) and its associated commentary by Rashi. According to Luskin, he visited the Lubavitcher Rebbe in New York in 1990 and received a blessing from him. In order to accommodate Jewish religious proscriptions against performing labor on the Sabbath, in 2011 Givot Olam introduced Shabbat clocks into its production system to obviate the use of manual faucets. Land rights With the location of Meged Oil field close to the border between Israel and the West Bank, it is subject to a dispute over ownership rights. Palestinians claim that Givot Olam decided that the field is commercially viable only after the creation of the Israeli West Bank barrier to the west of the field, which they claim is located within the borders of the Ramallah and al-Bireh Governorate. According to a source in the Palestinian Authority, 80% of the Meged oil field is on land owned by Palestinians. Efraim Sneh has stated that although the oil drilling site is in Israel the oil reservoir may extend to the West Bank near the West Bank village of Rantis. Sneh suggested that cooperation between the Israeli and Palestinian sides could lead to the construction of a joint oil pipeline. Fracking According to reports published by Givot Olam, the methods used in determining the potential for oil extraction at some of the Meged wells involve fracking.

Amateur career Esa began his amateur boxing career at the age of 17 in New Jersey, accumulating a record of 7-1 with 7 knockouts. His only loss was to future heavyweight champion Larry Holmes. At the age of 20, while preparing for the Olympic trials, Esa was hit in the face with a bottle and required over 300 facial stitches, which ended his amateur career. Professional career After playing defensive end in football for Saint Peter's College in New Jersey, Esa tried out for the Miami Dolphins. He suffered a helmet strike to his knee which abruptly ended any football career. A few months later, after he successfully rehabilitated his knee, Esa heard that boxing legend Muhammad Ali was training at a local gym, so he headed down for the opportunity to meet his hero. While at the gym watching Ali, Esa hung out in the back and worked on the heavy bag. Angelo Dundee was impressed with Esa's technique and power and introduced himself. The next day Esa met with the Dundee brothers to discuss his professional career. Dundee introduced Esa to Murray Gaby who became his manager and Dwayne Simpson who became his trainer. Esa fought under the Mendoza Group, who he credits for helping his professional boxing career. A few weeks later, on July 22, 1975, Esa made his professional debut at the Miami Beach Convention Hall against James Edwards. Esa won his first five fights, all by first-round knockout, before suffering his first loss in April 1976. Esa came back and won 13 of 15 fights with one draw and one loss by unanimous decision. In October 1977, Esa fought a six- round undercard bout in Las Vegas against the newly turned professional and future heavyweight champion John Tate. Esa, who had been arrested in his hotel room and had spent the previous night in jail, was knocked out in the third round. The fight's promoters Lou Duva and Bob Arum were criticized for promoting a mismatch. Following losses in three of four fights during the next three years, Esa's career ended in 1981. According to his cornerman, Ferdie Pacheco, Esa had a precarious reputation as a journeyman who \\"couldn't take a hard rap\\" and was \\"never in shape\\" enough to last more than a couple of rounds. In 2012, Lou Esa was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

The company is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The website serves to facilitate petitions by the general public. Previously corporations including Virgin America, and organizations such as Amnesty International and the Humane Society, paid the site to host and promote their petitions. Change.org's stated mission is to \\"empower people everywhere to create the change they want to see.\\" Popular topics of Change.org petitions are economic and criminal justice, human rights, education, environmental protection, animals rights, health, and sustainable food. History Change.org was launched in 2007 by current chief executive Ben Rattray, with the support of founding chief technology officer Mark Dimas, Darren Haas, and Adam Cheyer. As of February 2012, the site had 100 employees with offices on four continents. By the end of 2012, Rattray stated \\"he plans to have offices in 20 countries and to operate in several more languages, including Arabic and Chinese.\\" In May 2013, the company announced a $15 million round of investment led by Omidyar Network and said it has 170 staff members in 18 countries. In 2011, Change.org claimed it was the subject of a distributed denial of service attack by \\"Chinese hackers\\", and that the alleged attack was apparently related to its petition to the Chinese government to release artist Ai Weiwei. In 2011, there was a proposal to merge the Spanish-speaking counterpart website Actuable into Change.org. It took place in 2012 when they approved the voluntary union of Actuable users into the Change.org platform. In 2012, Arizona State University decided to block access to Change.org in response to a petition created by student Eric Haywood protesting \\"rising tuition costs at the school\\". University officials claimed that \\"Change.org is a spam site\\" and the blocking was conducted \\"to protect the use of our limited and valuable network resources for legitimate academic, research, and administrative uses\\". It was reported on April 5, 2012, that Change.org hit 10 million members, and was the fastest-growing social action platform on the web. At that time, they were receiving 500 new petitions per day. On May 13, 2012, The Guardian, BBC News and other sources reported that Change.org would launch a UK-specific platform for petitions, placing Change.org in competition with 38 Degrees, a British not-for-profit political-activism organization. An August 2013 Fast Company's article reported that Change.org would soon begin featuring petition recipients, saying, \\"For the first time, companies will be able to post a public response to any given petition (currently, they can only respond to the person who started the campaign). They will also be able to create their own Decision Maker page, which will show all petitions against them, the number of signatures gathered, and their statuses.\\" Notable petitions = Brazil= On May 16, 2016, President Dilma‚Äôs impeachment request received 2,216,560 signatures. = United States= In December 2011, a fourth-grade class in Brookline, Massachusetts, launched the \\"Lorax Petition Project\\" through Change.org requesting Universal Studios to include more of an environmental message on its website and trailer for its upcoming film, The Lorax, a classic Dr. Seuss children's story. The website and trailer lacked the important message from the book, \\"to help the environment\\". The petition collected over 57,000 signatures, and on January 26, 2012, the studio updated the website \\"with the environmental message the kids had dictated\\". On the morning of February 2, 2012, Stef Gray, a 23-year-old graduate in New York, held a news conference at the Washington offices of Sallie Mae where she presented the results of her Change.org, Sallie Mae, the \\"nation's largest private student- loan provider\\" petition, which had received about 77,000 signers. That afternoon the company changed its forbearance fee policy. In November 2013, Aaron Thompson from Tuscaloosa, Alabama started a petition, directed at Seth MacFarlane to bring back Brian Griffin on the TV series Family Guy, after he was briefly killed off in the Season 12 episode \\"Life of Brian\\". Thompson's petition gained 30,000 signatures within 36 hours. The character was brought back to the show a few episodes later. In September 2014, Karol Wilcox of Hayti, Missouri started a petition against the planned execution of Beau, a two-and-a-half-year-old dog in Dyersburg, Tennessee, for allegedly killing a duck on his owner's property. By November, this petition had gained over 540,000 signatures. The petition worked and the dog was spared. After the 2016 United States presidential election, in which Donald Trump was declared President-elect of the United States, there were mass protests. As part of these protests, one California man started a change.org petition on November 10, 2016, which called for electors in states that Trump won to become faithless electors and cast their vote for Hillary Clinton instead at state Electoral College meetings. The petition acquired over 4 million signatures by November 14, 2016, only 4 days after it started. By November 23, 2016, it had gotten 4.5 million signatures. The petition ultimately failed as, on December 19, 2016, Trump officially gained the presidency with 304 electors. The petition closed with 4.9 million signatures, the highest in change.org history, until March 5, 2019, when it was surpassed by a petition opposing the Article 13 of the proposed Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. That petition was then toppled on May 30, 2020 by a petition made in order to get justice for George Floyd, an unarmed, African-American man who was killed by police. As of early July 2020, the petition had nearly 19 million signatures, making it the most signed petition in the history of change.org. In summer 2017, a petition on change.org called for /r/incels (incel named after an abbreviation for \\"involuntary celibate\\") to be banned for inciting violence against women. On November 3, 2017, following sexual assault claims made against actor Kevin Spacey, Netflix fired the actor from, and stalled the production of, the sixth and final season of the television series in which Spacey had starred in on the network, House of Cards. Following Spacey's dismissal, a petition created on November 2, 2017, calling for Spacey to be replaced by actor Kevin James as a post-plastic surgery Frank Underwood began gaining a rapid number of supporters; this petition has gained media notability since its inception, gaining 50,000 supporters within eight days. In wake of the Logan Paul suicide video controversy, user \\"... - .- -.-- .- .-.. .. ...- .\\" (\\"stayalive\\" in Morse code) created a petition entitled ‚ÄúDelete Logan Paul‚Äôs YouTube Channel\\", having received more than 520,000 signatures as of January 15, 2018. While numerous other petitions have been created for the same purpose, none have received as much attention. On July 14, 2019, an online petition titled \\"The Immediate Halt to the Construction of the TMT Telescope\\" was posted on Change.org in protest against the Thirty Meter Telescope. The online petition has currently gathered over 278,057 signatures worldwide. = United Kingdom= On March 10, 2015, political blogger Guido Fawkes, whose real name is Paul Staines, started a petition to reinstate Jeremy Clarkson, BBC co-host of TV series Top Gear. This followed the BBC's decision to suspend him over a \\"fracas\\" involving a producer on the show. The petition gained over 500,000 signatures within 24 hours, making it the fastest growing petition to date for the site, while having the servers at Change.org in the UK regularly become unresponsive due to the high demand. It had gained over 1,000,000 signatures by March 20, 2015 and it was delivered to the BBC. On March 25, 2015, the BBC released an official statement confirming that, as a result of the actions which led to his suspension, they would not be renewing his contract with the show. A petition was started in 2020, to get fundraiser Tom Moore knighted, as of April 30, has 1 million people sign. He was then knighted on 20 May. A petition was started in 2020, to get Dominic Cummings sacked after it emerged he travelled from London to his parents' home in Durham with coronavirus symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown, as of May 30, this has 1 million signatures. = Canada= In August 2014, Erica Perry from Vancouver, BC, started a petition asking Centerplate, a large food and beverage corporation serving entertainment venues in North America and the UK, to fire its then-CEO Desmond \\"Des\\" Hague after the public release of security camera footage allegedly showing Hague abusing a young Doberman Pinscher in an elevator. In response to Centerplate not taking action after the incident other than releasing a statement of apology from Hague, and an agreement by Hague to commit to perform certain charitable acts, the petition called for Centerplate to fire Hague. On September 2, 2014, after the petition had received over 190,000 signatures, Hague resigned from his position as CEO of Centerplate. On April 29, 2018, two nights after the release of Avengers: Infinity War, Ryan Leger from Bolton, Ontario started a petition for Marvel Studios to extend Mark Ruffalo's contract for him to appear in an Incredible Hulk 2 and for Universal Pictures to let Disney have the distribution rights to any potential post-Avengers: Endgame Hulk films and Disney, in return, give Universal, for each, a marquee credit (including placement of the studio's opening logo) and 8-9% of the profits as they have for Paramount Pictures with The Avengers and Iron Man 3.https://comicbookrumors.com/petition-for-mark- ruffalo-to-get-his-own-post-avengers-4-hulk-film/ = France= In February 2016, 50 petitions have exceeded 100,000 signatories. A petition against the \\"Loi El Khomri\\", a labor law project by the French Labor Minister Myriam El Khomri has over 1 million signatures. = Philippines= The petition to have death row convict Mary Jane Veloso released was the fastest ever growing petition from the Philippines with over 250,000 signatories from over 125 countries. = Australia= In 2018 an anonymous creator of a Facebook community built on hatred for people riding bikes started a Change.org anti- cycling petition that has grown in a short time to reach over 100,000 signatures. Allegedly, there is evidence many of the names on the petition are fake. In 2019, a petition directed towards the Australian government to remove Senator Fraser Anning from the Australian Federal Parliament after his comments on the terrorist attack in Christchurch, New Zealand. Anning blamed immigration laws, the victims and heightening fears of Muslims for the attack. The petition (as at 10:11 AM UTC on March 24, 2019) has 1,418,105 signatures, making it one of the second most signed petitions on Change.org, and the highest concerning Australian affairs. = Mexico= After two earthquakes hit Central Mexico on September 7 and September 19, 2017, there were different petitions to force the \\"Instituto Nacional Electoral\\" (National Electoral Institute), the Mexican Senate, and President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to donate most or all of the money destined for the upcoming 2018 general elections be redirected to victims of the natural disaster in Mexico City and neighbor states of Morelos, Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Puebla. All petitions together sum the number of more than 3 million signatures. Business model Change.org makes revenue through a subscription membership model, people promoting petitions on the site, and crowdfunding. Change.org members contribute monthly to sustain the technology and the small teams of campaigners who coach and support petition starters. The majority of the company's revenue is advertising - individuals and organisations who start or sign petitions then chip in to promote those petitions to other site visitors. To date, Change.org has raised $50 million to fuel its growth from mission-aligned investors in business, technology and the media. In 2017 an investment round driven by Reid Hoffman helped drive the shift to the current business model. The website previously made revenue by running advertisements called sponsored campaigns for advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International and list-building services to partner organizations. In May 2013 the website started \\"crowd-promoted petitions\\" that allowed a signatory to promote the petition by paying $5 to $1000 at the final stage of petition signing. Criticism =Fake signatures= In 2018, Anne Savage, the CEO of Bicycle Queensland, claimed that a massive Australian‚Äìbased anti-cycling petition on Change.org was full of false names. She said Bicycle Queensland had received information that many of the names were created by electronic ‚Äúbots‚Äù. A spokesperson for Change.org denied that the signatures were fake, saying that the organisation's engineering team had double-checked the petition and confirmed they had not detected any unusual activity. =Visibility of personal information= Under certain conditions, signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. Change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on Change.org. Conversely, the platform has been criticized for not providing enough information on who has signed a petition; for instance a means of verifying that a petition protesting a politician has been signed by his or her constituents or that the signatures are genuine at all. =Corporate structure= There has been debate and criticism around the fact that Change.org is a for-profit business despite using the .org domain suffix rather than the commercial .com. The site has been accused of fooling its users and hiding the fact that it is \\"a for-profit entity that has an economic incentive to get people to sign petitions\\". Change.org spokesperson Charlotte Hill countered this criticism in a September 2013 article in Wired, saying, \\"We are a mission-driven social enterprise, and while we bring in revenue, we reinvest 100% of that revenue back into our mission of empowering ordinary people. It's not just that we're not yet making a profit ‚Äì it's that we are decidedly not for-profit.\\" =Advertising policy= In 2012, the site dropped most of the restrictions it previously placed on paid content. Internal documents began referring to \\"clients\\" and \\"partners\\" as \\"advertisers\\" and stated that \\"only advertisers strictly identified as 'hate groups' are to be banned.\\" As a result, Change.org was accused of encouraging astroturfing and abandoning the progressive user base from which it initially gained traction. Additional controversy arose when the employee who initially leaked the documents was fired. Of the users who lost interest in the site after this change, a number of them expressed difficulty in being removed from Change.org mailing lists. =Selling of personal data= Change.org has also been accused of selling the personal data provided by the users to third-party companies that hire its services. =Use for trending topics= Topics for Change.org petitions have grown to include disagreement with the Academy Awards and removing milk from certain types of coffee. The authors of these petitions have been criticized for focusing on ‚Äúfirst world problems‚Äù. Further debate over the content of petitions came in November 2014 when Martin Daubney called some of them \\"bizarre\\" and stated that the site was being used to promote censorship. In response, the Change.org communication director John Coventry defended the wide range of petitions, saying that \\"people make an informed choice in what they want to support.\\" The following week saw criticism alleging that petitions about the media receive more attention than petitions about \\"saving 'actual' lives.\\" =Donations= Change.org solicits signers to also donate money upon signing the petition. Although the donation is optional, it can be misleading to users who may believe the donations are used to fund petition organizers. It is unknown as to what Change.org uses donations for, however, the donations are likely used for their own profit.

The term is derived from the Greek words and . The classic (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the \\"dog curve\\"; this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after something it has spotted on the other side. Because the dog drifts with the current, it will have to change its heading; it will also have to swim further than if it had taken the optimal heading. This case was described by Pierre Bouguer in 1732. A radiodrome may alternatively be described as the path a dog follows when chasing a hare, assuming that the hare runs in a straight line at a constant velocity. 330x330px Mathematical analysis Introduce a coordinate system with origin at the position of the dog at time zero and with y-axis in the direction the hare is running with the constant speed V_t.

She subsequently ran for Mayor of Atlanta in 1993, before running as the Republican Party's nominee for Lieutenant governor of Georgia in 1994, where she lost to incumbent Democrat Pierre Howard. She unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Governor in 1998, finishing in third place behind Guy Millner and Mike Bowers with 7.7% of the vote in the party's primary election. She was elected to the State Senate in 2004 for the northern-state 50th district, where she served until she was defeated by Jim Butterworth in a Republican primary in 2008. She had also sought to wrest the Republican nomination for Georgia's 10th congressional district from Paul Broun in 2008, but withdrew her candidacy before the primary election. Beliefs Throughout her career as an activist and politician, she was a champion of Christian conservative causes, opposing the department of Child Protective Services (a.k.a. Department of Children and Families). After four years of investigation, on November 16, 2007 she published a report entitled \\"The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services\\". After publishing the report, in a press conference she exclaimed that the report caused her to lose her position as a Georgia State Senator. In addition, she stood firmly in her support of the Pro-Life agenda, and also opposed Gay marriage. In expressing her Christian beliefs she promoted the display of the Ten Commandments in public places. She was a senior official in the Baptist church, having served as a First Vice President of the Georgia Baptist Convention. Murder Schaefer was found dead at her home in Turnerville, Georgia in Habersham County on 26 March 2010 with a single gunshot wound to her back along with her husband of 52 years, Bruce Schaefer who was found with a single gunshot wound to his chest. Police concluded the deaths to have been a murder‚Äìsuicide perpetrated by her husband, but the motive for the murder was unclear and never established. Before her death she published and promoted the report \\"The Corrupt Business of Child Protective Services\\", leading to conspiracy theories surrounding her murder. Upon her death, fellow State Senator Ralph Hudgens eulogized her as \\"almost like a rock star of the Christian right\\".

The track passes close to moshav Heletz, from which it derives its name. History The railway was constructed by Israel Railways in the early 1980s, to provide a shortcut for freight trains from southern Israel headed for the Port of Ashdod.

It is one of his lesser-known piano pieces, although it has been recorded numerous times.  Structure  The overall key of the Bol√©ro is difficult to establish. It was often listed as Bol√©ro in C major - A minor, as the work opens with three unison octaves in G (dominant chords of C major) in fortissimo, then a lengthy Introduction in C major, moving to A minor (relative minor) for the Bol√©ro proper. It is interrupted by sections in A major, A-flat major and B-flat minor before returning to A minor. It ends triumphantly in A major (parallel major).  Composition  The work was dedicated to the Scottish-born but half-French Mademoiselle la Comtesse √âmilie de Flahaut,Otto-Haas Music then aged only 14, and a pupil of Chopin's. She was later to become Countess of Shelburne.The apparent inspiration for the Bol√©ro was Chopin's friendship with the French soprano Pauline Viardot, whose father, the famed Spanish tenor Manuel Garc√≠a, had introduced boleros to Paris by the time of Chopin's arrival there.Naxos His biographer Frederick Niecks speculated that it was inspired by the Bolero in Daniel Auber's La muette de Portici (1828). Despite the ostensibly Spanish flavour of the piece, it has been described as a polonaise in disguise, or a bol√©ro √† la polonaise, as its rhythms are more redolent of the national dance of Chopin's homeland than anything Spanish. It was written five years before Chopin first visited Spain (1838).

She has been described as \\"the greatest patron American horticulture has ever known\\" by Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden. Family and early years Haupt was born in Chicago to Sadie and Moses Annenberg, the Jewish founder of a publishing empire based on The Daily Racing Form and The Philadelphia Inquirer. She was fourth of eight children and last surviving child (seven girls and a boy) born to the couple; the boy was Walter H. Annenberg, who was to become a publisher and philanthropist in his own right. One of her sisters was Janet Annenberg Hooker. She grew up in Milwaukee. She was tall and thin as a young girl, and resolved to impress her older sisters by memorizing a new word each day. She attended Mount Ida Seminary in Newton, Massachusetts, during which time her family moved to New York. Her father was convicted of tax evasion during the 1930s and sentenced to two years in prison; he died before the end of his sentence.\\"Enid A Haupt Philanthropist keen on gardens and youth\\" \\"The Guardian\\",1 Nov 2005 Haupt obituary in the Guardian Adult life and professional career In 1953, she was charged with publishing Seventeen magazine, a post she would hold until 1970. She also wrote \\"Young Living\\", a syndicated fashion, beauty and lifestyle column. Haupt's first marriage, to Norman Bensinger, ended in divorce; they had one child, Pamela Enid Bensinger (Nusbaum, Allen), (1929-1997). She later married Ira Haupt, who died in 1963. It was through this marriage that she became involved with gardening, particularly in the growing of flowers, after she encouraged her husband to help his gardeners find better jobs. Philanthropic legacy Haupt is quoted as often having said \\"Nature is my religion,\\" and once told The New York Times \\"Books are the most important things in my life besides nature.\\" As an heiress to a family fortune, she was able to make significant contributions to her personal causes and interests, foremost among which was horticulture. Haupt contributed the Haupt Fountains at the Ellipse located between the White House and the Washington Monument, and also a four-acre Victorian garden, known as the Enid A. Haupt Garden, on the south side of the Smithsonian Institution Building (\\"The Castle\\"). The Garden's architect, Jean Paul Carlihan, intended the Garden to interpret nearby museums. The Garden is situated atop the underground portions of the Quadrangle building, which includes the National Museum of African Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery (Asian art), and the S. Dillon Ripley Center.

Ray Johnston who had just reformed the studio after having had a troubled merger for two years with Herbert J. Yates and Republic Pictures. This film was conceived as a low-budget feature meant to capitalize on Dick Merrill's and Jack Lambie's historic \\"Coronation Flight\\", which made them world-famous. Recreating the flight that made him famous, Dick Merrill, along with co-pilot Jack Lambie reprise their real-life roles as pilots.  Plot  When pilot Dick Bennett (Dick Merrill) undertakes a flight in stormy conditions to save a dying girl, he brings the aircraft in, despite warnings that it is too dangerous. Later, he meets socialite Gail Strong (Paula Stone), who is interested in aviation and persuades Bennett's aircraft engineer friend Bill Edwards (Weldon Heyburn) to try a parachute jump. Her fianc√©, Baron Hayygard (Ivan Lebedeff) pledges that he will win the Stanley Trophy Race, to make her keep her promise to marry him, and resorts to desperate measures, knocking out Bennett. When Bennett is unable to fly his untested racer, Edwards takes it up instead, but crashes. Strong realizes she is in love with Edwards, but he is critically injured. A doctor in England has life-saving serum that Bennett and Jack Carter (Jack Lambie) are determined to bring back to save their friend, by making a record-breaking round-trip to London. Coming back through a raging storm over the Atlantic, their aircraft is struck by lightning, disabling their radio. When contact is lost, Coast Guard ships are deployed, but the intrepid flyers make it in.  Cast  As appearing in screen credits:\\"Full credits: 'Atlantic Flight' (1937).\\" IMDb.

Lyle  Production  In 1937 Merrill was hired by Hearst Publishing to repeat the \\"Ping-Pong Flight\\", co-piloted by 27-year-old Jack Lambie in a Lockheed Model 10E Electra dubbed \\"Daily Express\\". Hearst wanted to scoop other American newspapers by acquiring photos of the May 10, 1937 coronation of King George VI after the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII. Merrill carried photos (not newsreels, as often claimed) of the Hindenburg disaster, which occurred shortly before the flight. Hearst papers on both sides of the Atlantic published the first pictures of each event, and Merrill earned the Harmon Trophy for 1937 for his achievement. Footage from this flight was used to make the Atlantic Flight. Dramatic air race and crash scenes were also used. Milburn Stone who played aircraft mechanic Henry Wadsworth \\"Pokey\\" Schultz, was in his first major role; his cousin, Paula Stone appeared as Gail Strong. Both Dick Merrill and Jack Lambie, his real- life \\"Coronation Flight\\" co-pilot and co-star in the film, received $2,500 for their roles in this movie. Dick had not taken the filming seriously but gladly accepted the windfall. He was a teetotaler in an age when the \\"hard-drinking\\" \\"fun-loving\\" aerial adventurer was seen as the norm.

In 1915, the South African Railways placed fifteen Class 14B saturated steam locomotives with a 4-8-2 Mountain type wheel arrangement in service. When they were subsequently converted to superheating, they were reclassified to Class 14. In the 1930s all but one were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14R.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, July 1945. pp. 515-516. Manufacturer The third version of the Class 14 locomotive was ordered from Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1914. Fifteen locomotives were delivered in 1915, numbered in the range from 1746 to 1760. These saturated steam versions of the Class 14 were designated Class 14B.Beyer, Peacock and Company production list, excluding Garratts, Customer List V1 04.08.02 Characteristics D.A. Hendrie Like the Class 14, the Class 14B had Walschaerts valve gear and a Belpaire firebox. Because it was intended for use on the lower section of the Natal mainline, D.A. Hendrie, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR), concluded that no high degree of superheat would be attainable and the locomotives were therefore ordered without superheaters. They were intended for use on the Town Hill section near Pietermaritzburg, where the old line was on a 1 in 30 (3‚Öì%) gradient and where speeds were low with frequent stops which, it was reasoned, would not justify the use of superheating. Modification and reclassification Once in service, the omission of superheating soon became a bone of contention. About six years after the Class 14B was commissioned, an officer of the Mechanical Department submitted a report which claimed that the loss of haulage power and increased water and coal consumption which were brought about by the absence of superheating on these engines, represented a loss to the SAR of approximately ¬£100,000 when compared with the superheated . Given that eight years later, in 1929, the purchase price of a new Class 19A locomotive would be ¬£6,387 (¬£5,323 for the engine and ¬£1,064 for the tender), this was a staggering amount.Sterkstroom, Municipality - SAR Class 19A No 692 This report caused a flutter in the Railways Administration. The officer who made it, left the service to do very well elsewhere. Conversion of the Class 14B to superheating began soon afterwards. Between 1922 and 1925, all fifteen Class 14B locomotives were converted. Their cylinders were reamed from bore and the boiler pressure reduced from . Since their being non-superheated with smaller cylinders had been the only reasons for their separate Class 14B classification, they were all reclassified to .South African Railways & Harbours/Suid Afrikaanse Spoorwe√´ en Hawens (15 Aug 1941). Locomotive Diagram Book/Lokomotiefdiagramboek, 3'6\\" Gauge/Spoorwydte. SAR/SAS Mechanical Department/Werktuigkundige Dept.

Drawing Office/Tekenkantoor, Pretoria. pp. 6a-7a, 41, 43. Of all the locomotives introduced during Hendrie's term as CME, the Class 14B was the only one to fall short of expectations. In fairness to Hendrie and his decision to omit superheating, it should be borne in mind that, at the time, automatic dampers were still in use, which cut out the superheater while the regulator was closed. This reduced much of the superheater's effectiveness on undulating track and where frequent stops are required. A report had been submitted in Natal earlier to the effect that superheating was of little or no advantage on that System, where the many short and steep gradients prevented a high degree of superheat from being attained with the automatic dampers in use at the time. In view of the added cost and weight of the superheating equipment, the arguments against it in Natal were therefore considered reasonable at the time. Watson Standard boilers During the 1930s, many serving locomotives were reboilered with a standard boiler type designed by then CME A.G. Watson as part of his standardisation policy. Such Watson Standard reboilered locomotives were reclassified by adding an \\"R\\" suffix to their classification. From 1935, all the ex Class 14B locomotives except no. 1750 were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14R. Only slight modifications were found necessary to take the new boilers. In the process, the engines were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of the original cabs. The flangeless leading coupled wheels were flanged and Type MR tenders were attached to the reboilered engines. No. 1750 was sold to ISCOR without being reboilered. Class 14R no. 1756, 23 March 1979 Their original Belpaire boilers were fitted with Ramsbottom safety valves, while the Watson Standard boiler was fitted with Pop safety valves. An obvious difference between an original and a Watson Standard reboilered locomotive is usually a rectangular regulator cover, just to the rear of the chimney on the reboilered locomotive. In the case of the ex Class 14B locomotives, two even more obvious differences are the Watson cab and the absence of the Belpaire firebox hump between the cab and boiler on the reboilered locomotives. Service =South African Railways= The locomotives were initially in service on the lower sections of the Natal mainline, particularly the Town Hill section near Pietermaritzburg. After their reboilering and the electification of the Natal mainline, most were then allocated to Empangeni in the north and Port Shepstone in the south. In 1976, many were transferred to the Witwatersrand for shunting service. They were all withdrawn from service by 1983. =Industrial= Five of these engines were eventually sold into industrial service: * No. 1750 became ISCOR no. 15 and later Enyati Colliery no. 3. * No. 1754 and no. 1759 went to Rustenburg Platinum Mines, retaining their SAR numbers. * No. 1755 became St Helena Gold Mines no. 7. * No. 1757 was sold to Grootvlei Proprietary Mines Limited.

It is monotypic within the genus Monticolomys, and is closely related to the big-footed mouse (Macrotarsomys). It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below. It has small, rounded, densely haired ears and broad feet with well-developed pads. The long tail lacks a tuft at the tip. The skull is delicate and lacks crests and ridges on its roof. First collected in 1929, the Malagasy mountain mouse was not formally described until 1996, but it is now known to have a broad distribution. Active during the night, it occurs in both montane forest and human-disturbed grasslands and feeds on fruits and seeds. A scansorial animal, it climbs trees but also lives on the ground. Although habitat destruction may pose a threat, it is classified as \\"Least Concern\\" on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy A specimen was captured in 1929 during the Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Am√©ricaine to Madagascar, but the rodents obtained by the expedition were never studied in detail. It was not until the 1970s that Karl Koopman and Guy Musser recognized that the animal‚Äîwhose skin had landed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, while the skull was at the Mus√©um national d'histoire naturelle in Paris‚Äîrepresented an otherwise unknown species. However, they never published their results. In 1993, Steven Goodman rediscovered the species on Madagascar and in 1996 he and Michael Carleton finally published a formal description.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 232 They named the animal Monticolomys koopmani, as the sole member of a new genus.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 233 The generic name Monticolomys means \\"mountain-dwelling mouse\\" and refers to the animal's montane habitat, and the specific name koopmani honors Karl Koopman for his many contributions to mammalian systematics.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 242 Common names in use for the animal also include \\"Koopman's montane voalavo\\"Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 952 and \\"Malagasy mountain mouse\\". The indigenous rodents of Madagascar, the Nesomyinae, prior to the discovery of Monticolomys comprised seven very distinctive genera‚Äîso distinct from each other that some have found it difficult to accept that they are closely related.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 249 Monticolomys, however, does not follow this pattern, in that it is similar and closely related to the gerbil-like genus Macrotarsomys of western Madagascar. This relationship was originally proposed by Goodman and Carleton based on morphology,Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 250 and was strongly supported by a DNA sequence analysis (based on the cytochrome b gene) published in 1999.Jansa et al., 1999, pp. 262‚Äì263 While this study provided some weak support for a relationship between the Macrotarsomys‚ÄìMonticolomys clade and the giant jumping rat, Hypogeomys,Jansa et al., 1999, p. 263 a later study based on the IRBP gene instead placed Macrotarsomys‚ÄìMonticolomys sister to a clade containing four other nesomyine genera‚ÄîEliurus, Voalavo, Gymnuromys, and Brachytarsomys.Jansa and Weksler, 2004, fig. 1 Description The Malagasy mountain mouse is a small, mouse-like rodent, and quite different in appearance from most other nesomyines.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 243 It has a thick, soft fur, which appears dark brown on the upperparts. The cover hairs (which comprise most of the fur) are tricolored: for the basal two-thirds of their length, they are plumbeous gray; the middle is ochraceous; and the tip is dark brown to black. The longer guard hairs, which are most common towards the middle of the back, are completely black. The fur of the underparts appears dark gray and is not sharply demarcated from the upperparts. There, the hairs are also plumbeous at the bases, but the tips range from white to yellowish-brown. The mystacial vibrissae‚Äîwhiskers above the mouth‚Äîare medium-sized. The short, rounded ears are densely covered with grayish hairs. Monticolomys has broad hindfeet bearing prominent pads and long outer digits.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, pp. 243‚Äì244 There are white hairs on the upper sides of the metapodials and digits, and long ungual tufts‚Äîtufts of hair surrounding the bases of the claws‚Äîare present. The thumb of the forefeet bears a nail, but claws are present on the other digits. The long tailCarleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 235 is covered with small scales and light brown hairs. The tail lacks a distinct tuft at the tip, as is present in Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Females have six mammae.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 236 Head and body length is , tail length is , hindfoot length is , ear length is , and body mass is .Carleton and Goodman, 1996, table 21-2; Goodman et al., 1999, table 14-2 The skull is small and delicate. The front part, the rostrum, is narrow and relatively long. The nasal bones are rounded at the front, but blunt at the back. The zygomatic plate‚Äîa bony plate at the side of the skull‚Äîis narrow and extends back to the front margin of the first upper molar (M1). The jugal bones constitute much of the thin zygomatic arches (cheekbones). The interorbital region, between the eyes, is narrow and hourglass-shaped. There are no crests or ridges on the interorbital region or on the braincase.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 237 The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid strut, so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar (abdomen), 4 sacral (hip), and 38 caudal (tail) vertebrae.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 238 The upper incisors have orange enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge of the tooth inclined backwards. The root of the lower incisors extends though the mandible (lower jaw) to a low capsular process at the back of the jawbone. The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear distinct cusps. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 239 The molars are quite similar to those of Macrotarsomys, and differ only in minor details.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 245 Distribution and ecology The species' range is now known to extend across the mountain ranges of eastern Madagascar from the Tsaratanana MassifMaminirina et al., 2008, p. 716 south to Andohahela, at above sea level. It occurs in montane forest, but also in degraded grassland, where it is among the first species to return after fires.Rasolonondrasana and Goodman, 2006, p. 81 At Ankaratra, where the species was recorded in 1929, it occurred in such grassland, where the nesomyine Brachyuromys betsileoensis was also found. The animal was again recorded at Ankaratra in 1996, this time in a heavily disturbed forest, where it occurred with Eliurus minor and the introduced black rat (Rattus rattus).Goodman et al., 1996, pp. 111, 113, 118 At Andringitra, the animal was recorded in high montane forest together with six other nesomyines‚ÄîBrachyuromys ramirohitra, Eliurus minor, Eliurus tanala, Eliurus webbi, Gymnuromys roberti, and Nesomys rufus‚Äîas well as the black rat.Carleton and Goodman, 1996, p. 240 At Andohahela, Monticolomys was found at an altitude of in sclerophyllous forest.Goodman et al., 1999, p. 231 Its distribution corresponds to the High Mountain Domain, a region defined on the basis of plant distributions. This region is now discontinuous, but the High Mountain Domain habitat was continuous from mountain to mountain as recently as the early Holocene.Goodman et al., 1999, p. 232 Subfossil remains have been found in Mahajanga Province (northwestern Madagascar).Mein et al., 2010, p. 105 Malagasy mountain mouse is morphologically uniform across its wide distribution.Goodman et al., 1999, p. 232; Maminirina et al., 2008, p. 716 The Malagasy mountain mouse is nocturnal and solitary and produces litters of up to three offspring.Goodman et al., 2003, table 13.4 It is scansorial, spending time on the ground but also climbing in vegetation. In Andringitra, two specimens were captured on a liana over the ground, and a third was caught on the ground together with two shrew tenrecs (Microgale taiva). All five specimens from Andohahela were trapped on the ground, as was the specimen caught in Ankaratra in 1996. Its diet includes fruits and seeds; in captivity, it eats Agauria fruits.Rasolonondrasana and Goodman, 2006, p. 80 Conservation status As Malagasy mountain mouse is now known to be a widespread, common species occurring in at least one protected area (Andringitra National Park; it may also occur in Ankarana Special Reserve), it is listed on the IUCN Red List as \\"Least Concern\\". However, fires pose a threat in montane forest and, at lower elevations, its habitat is being converted into agricultural land. References Literature cited * Carleton, M.D. and Goodman, S.M.

Bo√ªk√®tes may be eaten hot or cold, garnished with a local brown sugar known as cassonade or with sirop de Li√®ge. The name derives from the Dutch-language word boekweit (\\"buckwheat\\") and is attested with that meaning in the early 17th century, before being used to refer to the pancake itself: a usage first recorded in 1743. Bo(u)quettes were first introduced to the city of Li√®ge in the 18th century, imported by the court of the Prince- Bishops from the County of Loon and the district around Tongeren in Flanders. By the end of the 19th century the pancakes had become a Li√®ge speciality.

He entered Trinity College Dublin, on 1 May 1775 as a pensioner, under the tutorship of the Rev. Dr. Drought, and was elected a Scholar in 1778. He graduated B.A. in 1780, M.A. in 1785, and B.D. and D.D. in 1795. In 1781 he was elected a fellow of his college. He was Donegall Lecturer of Mathematics (1790-1795), and in 1794 he was the first to hold the office of Donnellan Divinity Lecturer. In 1795 he was appointed Archbishop King's Lecturer in Divinity, succeeded to a senior fellowship, and also became the third Erasmus Smith's Professor of Mathematics (1795‚Äì1799). In 1799 he exchanged the Erasmus Smith's professorship of mathematics for that of natural philosophy. In 1789, he published the mathematical treatise Euclidis Elementorum Sex Libri Priores, Cum Notis (Dublin University Press), whose 10th edition appeared in 1833. On resigning his fellowship in 1806 Elrinton was presented by his college to the rectory of Ardtrea, in the diocese of Armagh, which he held until December 1811. He resigned, having been appointed to the provostship of Trinity College. During his tenure of this office he was the acting manager of almost every public board, and a supporter of charitable institutions. Elrington was advanced on 25 September 1820 to the bishopric of Limerick, and on 21 December 1822 he was translated to Leighlin and Ferns. While on his way to attend Parliament duties in London he died of paralysis at Liverpool on 12 July 1835. He was buried under the chapel of Trinity College Dublin, in which there was a monument with a Latin inscription to his memory. Another monument was erected by his clergy in the cathedral church of Ferns. Elrington was an active member of the Royal Irish Academy, and of other literary and scientific societies. The Elrington theological essay prize was instituted in Trinity College in 1837. A portrait of the bishop was painted in 1820 for his brother, Major Elrington, by Thomas Foster; engraved by William Ward, it was published in 1836 by Graves & Co.

It is common along the coastal plain from Florida to Georgia in the Southeastern United States. It is one of the three Iris species in the Iris flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper \\"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\\" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Description Iris virginica is a perennial plant. The plant has 2 to 4 erect or arching, bright green, lance-shaped leaves that are flattened into one plane at the base. Leaves are wide and are sometimes longer than the flower stalk. The fleshy roots ( in diameter) are rhizomes that spread underground. Pale brown, variably shaped seeds are born in three-part fruit capsules ( long, wide).Missouri Botanical Garden: Iris virginica The slightly fragrant flowers ( long, across) consist of 3 horizontal sepals, or \\"falls\\", and 3 erect petals. The petals and sepals can vary in color from dark-violet to pinkish- white. The sepals have a splash of yellow to yellow-orange at the crest. Each plant has 2 to 6 flowers that bloom from April to May upon a single, erect, tall stalk. The stalk is sometimes branched and has a slight zigzag appearance. Uses The Cherokee use this medicinal plant for traditional medicinal uses. The root is pounded into a paste that is used as a salve for the skin. An infusion made from the root is used to treat ailments of the liver, and a decoction of the root is used to treat \\"yellowish urine\\".

History and overview Learning circles are present in many indigenous cultures. For example, in some Native American cultures, councils of elders come together to understand problems in a spirit of shared community in \\"wisdom circles\\". The term learning circle has been used to describe group efforts with clear links to social change. Over time and across countries, civic organizations, neighborhood communities, trade unions, churches and social justice groups have used the idea of learning circles to empower their members to make choices and take action. Groups have used the term study circle or learning circle to refer to a form of adult education. For example, Educators for Community Engagement, found that learning circles‚Äîwith their principles of equal participation, reciprocity, and honoring of collective wisdom‚Äîembody the democratic principles of service- learning partnerships. They use learning circles, rather than more traditional forms of group meetings, to structure their annual conferences. Primary teachers use a simple form of learning circles when they gather the students at the rug for \\"circle time\\". Many educators are using learning circles to connect students from around the world. Among the goals of this activity are helping students to develop trust and respect for diversity of experience, and fostering both listening and speaking skills among peers. Researchers have used learning circles as a form of professional development to improve their practice. A similar term, quality circle, was used in the 1980s to characterize the successful practice in corporate settings in which the hierarchical boundaries between workers and managers are flattened to encourage participatory management and team leadership. Quality circles, originally associated with Japanese management and manufacturing techniques developed in Japan after World War II, were based on lectures of W. Edwards Deming (Joel & Ross, 1982). The goal was to encourage everyone to develop a strong sense of ownership over the process and products of the group. Models Learning circles have been used for centuries in many different situations. Two models are described here but others may exist. =OpenAgile learning circle= OpenAgile is an agile system of project and team management. In the OpenAgile system, the learning circle \\"is a simple and practical model of effective learning\\". The learning circle was adapted by Garry Bertieg from a development model in the \\"Building Momentum\\" document issued by the Bah√° º√≠ World Centre around 2003. The learning circle is one of OpenAgile's three foundations, alongside truthfulness and consultative decision-making. This model describes learning as a series of four steps, four capacities for us to develop, and the pivotal importance of guidance. Four steps The four steps in the learning circle are reflection, learning, planning, and action, and are followed one after another, over and over. It is possible to begin an endeavour with any of the four steps. * ReflectionThe reflection step is a pause in activities where people gather data, impressions, history, stories, and any other observations about what they have done. To do this effectively, they must develop and exercise the capacity for detachment from preconceived notions. * LearningIn the learning step people carefully examine the observations made in the reflection step and \\"discover\\" new insights, skills, relationships, structures, failures or any other conceptual changes. They search for the principles involved in their work. To do this effectively, they must develop and exercise the capacity to search for the underlying principles. * PlanningIn the planning step people apply the conceptual understandings they have developed. They use these newly discovered principles to systematically create a plan of action. Their planning should directly reflect each insight or principle they have learned. To do this step effectively, they must develop and exercise the capacity for love of learning. * ActionIn the action step, as an individual, team, or organization people carry out the plans they have created. To do this effectively, they may need courage to plunge into the unknown. Four capacities Each of the four capacities in the learning circle are prerequisites for taking the next step. At the same time, as people exercise these capacities, they develop these capacities within themselves, in their teams and their organizations. Their inner conditions and capabilities have an effect on their environment which in turn then has an effect on them. By going through the learning circle, people use and develop these four capacities: * DetachmentThe capacity for detachment supports the reflection step. Detachment is openness. Detachment means setting aside ego and objectively looking at the evidence including facts, events and feelings. * SearchThe capacity for search supports the learning step. Search includes consultation, wisdom, discernment, judgement, and search for solutions. * Love of learningThe capacity for love of the learning supports the planning step. Love creates openness to guidance. Love engenders vision, passion, and a sense of purpose. * CourageThe capacity for courage supports the action step. Courage encompasses conscious choice, volition, willingness, and desire to act even in the face of uncertainty. * GuidanceCentral to the effectiveness of the learning circle is guidance. Guidance is the act of assisting an individual, team, or organization to reach a destination by accompanying, giving directions, or supplying with them advice. Guidance plays a pivotal role in developing people's capacity and can be applied to all four steps and all four capacities. Guidance can come from within; a team member who has expertise can share it with the other team members. And Guidance can come from outside; people can bring experts into the organization, or can read information sources.
