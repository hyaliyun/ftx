Life Browell was the son of William Browell, formerly midshipman of the Centurion under Commodore Anson. He entered the Navy in 1771 on board the Merlin sloop, and, after serving on various ships, was moved shortly before the engagement off Ushant into the Victory. On 10 November 1778 he was made lieutenant, and was with Captain Macbride in the Artois at the hard-fought battle on the Dogger Bank, 5 August. 1781. In the armament of 1790 he was for a short time in the Canada, and, on that ship being paid off, was appointed to the Alcide, and in the spring of 1793 to the Leviathan. In the Leviathan he was present at the operations at the Siege of Toulon under Lord Hood. On 25 May 1794 he was officially discharged from the Leviathan on promotion; but as the ship was then with the fleet under Lord Howe, and in daily expectation of a battle, it would appear probable that he continued in her as a volunteer, and was present in the action of 1 June. On 29 November, he was posted into the Princess Augusta yacht. In June 1795 Lord Hugh Seymour, now a rear-admiral, hoisted his flag in the Sans Pareil, and selected Browell as his flag-captain. He thus had a distinguished share in the Battle of Groix on 23 June 1795, and continued in the Sans Pareil during the next two years, including the critical time of the mutiny at Spithead. The squadron under Lord Hugh's immediate command was, however, cruising when the mutiny broke out, and did not come into port until the ships at Spithead had returned to their obedience. In June the Sans Pareil was one of a squadron under Sir Roger Curtis, sent for a few weeks into the North Sea. On its return to Spithead, and while the ship was refitting, Captain Browell, being on shore at Gosport, was severely crushed by a bale of wool falling from a height. The injury to his back was such that for some time his life was despaired of; and though, after a long illness, he partially recovered, he was never again fit for active service. In 1805 he was appointed one of the captains of Greenwich Hospital, and in 1809 was advanced to be lieutenant-governor, a position which he held until his death, 22 July 1831.

Differences from Copy Trading and Program Trading  Mirror trading is sometimes also referred to as copy trading although copy trading differs slightly from mirror trading in the way that accounts are linked. In copy trading, the trader directly copies the moves of an individual successful trader; whereas in mirror trading, investment decisions are based on algorithms developed from trading patterns of number of successful traders. These other traders can come in the form of system developers, manual traders or financial institutions. Mirror trading has certain distinctions from program trading.

(died 1676), was an English clergyman, an ejected minister of 1662. Life Bryan was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and held the rectory of Barford, near Warwick, but left it to go to Coventry, as vicar of Trinity Church, in 1644. Bryan was appointed by Parliament, and was not cordially welcomed by the vestry. In 1646 Bryan, assisted by Obadiah Grew, vicar of St. Michael's, held a public disputation on infant baptism in Trinity Church with Hanserd Knollys, the baptist. Though Coventry was a stronghold of puritanism, it was not so well content as were some of its preachers to witness the subversion of the monarchy. Bryan, at the end of 1646, touched upon this dissatisfaction with the course which events were taking in a sermon which was printed. The vestry in 1647 agreed to raise his stipend. In 1652 and 1654 his services were sought by Shrewsbury, and the churchwardens stirred themselves to keep him; but the citizens were less interested in discharging their promises for the support of their clergy. Nevertheless, the puritan preachers remained at their posts until the Act of Uniformity 1662 ejected them. Bryan took very much the same view as Richard Baxter: to ministerial conformity he had ten objections, but he was willing to practise lay conformity and did so. Bishop John Hacket tried to overcome his scruples, and offered him a month to consider, beyond the time allowed by the act; but Bryan gave up his vicarage, and was succeeded by Nathaniel Wanley, of the ‚ÄòWonders of the Little World‚Äô (1678). Bryan continued to preach whenever and wherever he had liberty to do so; and in conjunction with Grew he founded a presbyterian congregation, which met, from 1672, in licensed rooms. Bryan also educated students for the ministry, though the dissenting academy as a recognised institution dates from Richard Frankland and his Rathmell Academy (1670). Bryan was very ready in controversy, and occasionally an extempore preacher. He was fond of George Herbert's poems, and himself wrote verse. A tithe of his income he distributed in charity. He died at an advanced age on 4 March 1676. His funeral sermon, by Wanley, is a generous tribute. Works Bryan published: * ‚ÄòThe Vertuous Daughter,‚Äô 1640, 4 (sermon, Prov. xxxi. 29, at St. Mary's, Warwick, at funeral, on 14 April 1636, of Cicely, daughter of Sir Thomas Puckering; at the end is ‚Äòher epitaph by the author‚Äô in verse). * ‚ÄòA Discovery of the probable Sin causing this great Iudgement of Rain and Waters, viz. our Discontentment with our present Government, and inordinate desire of our King,‚Äô 1647, (sermon, 1 Sam. xii. 16‚Äì20, at Coventry, on 23 Dec. 1646, being the day of public humiliation; dedication issued ‚Äòfrom my study in Coventry‚Äô on 26 December 1646). * ‚ÄòThe Warwickshire Ministers' Testimony to the Trueth of Jesus Christ, and to the Solemn League and Covenant; as also against the errours, heresies, and blasphemies of these times, and the toleration of them; sent in a letter to the Ministers of London, subscribers of the former testimony,‚Äô 1648, (signed by Bryan, Grew, and John Herring as ministers of Coventry). * ‚ÄòA Publick Disputation sundry dayes at Killingworth [Kenilworth] in Warwickshire between John Bryan, &c.; and John Onley, pastor of a church at Lawford, upon this question, Whether the parishes of this nation generally be true churches.

It is characterized by facial clefting (any type of cleft in the bones and tissues of the face, including a cleft lip and palate), a caudal appendage (a \\"human tail\\"), growth deficiency, intellectual and developmental disability, and abnormalities of the renal system (kidneys) and the male genitalia. Abnormalities of the heart, and other skeletal malformations may also be present. The syndrome was initially described by Georges Malpuech and associates in 1983. It is thought to be genetically related to Juberg-Hayward syndrome. Malpuech syndrome has also been considered as part of a spectrum of congenital genetic disorders associated with similar facial, urogenital and skeletal anomalies. Termed \\"3MC syndrome\\", this proposed spectrum includes Malpuech, Michels and Mingarelli- Carnevale (OSA) syndromes. Mutations in the COLLEC11 and MASP1 genes are believed to be a cause of these syndromes. The incidence of Malpuech syndrome is unknown. The pattern of inheritance is autosomal recessive, which means a defective (mutated) gene associated with the syndrome is located on an autosome, and the syndrome occurs when two copies of this defective gene are inherited. Characteristics Malpuech syndrome is congenital, being apparent at birth. It is characterized by a feature known as facial clefting. Observed and noted in the initial description of the syndrome as a cleft lip and palate, facial clefting is identified by clefts in the bones, muscles and tissues of the face, including the lips and palate. The forms of cleft lip and palate typically seen with Malpuech syndrome are midline (down the middle of the lip and palate) or bilateral (affecting both sides of the mouth and palate). Facial clefting generally encompasses a wide range of severity, ranging from minor anomalies such as a bifid (split) uvula, to a cleft lip and palate, to major developmental and structural defects of the facial bones and soft tissues. Clefting of the lip and palate occurs during embryogenesis. Additional facial and ortho-dental anomalies that have been described with the syndrome include: hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes, sometimes reported as telecanthus), narrow palpebral fissures (the separation between the upper and lower eyelids) and ptosis (drooping) of the eyelids, frontal bossing (prominent eyebrow ridge) with synophris, highly arched eyebrows, wide nasal root and a flattened nasal tip, malar hypoplasia (underdeveloped upper cheek bone), micrognathia (an undersized lower jaw), and prominent incisors. Auditory anomalies include an enlarged ear ridge, and hearing impairment associated with congenital otitis media (or \\"glue ear\\", inflammation of the middle ear) and sensorineural hearing loss. Another feature identified with Malpuech syndrome is a caudal appendage. A caudal appendage is a congenital outgrowth stemming from the coccyx (tailbone). Present in many non-human animal species as a typical tail, this feature when seen in an infant has been described as a \\"human tail\\". This was observed by Guion-Almeida (1995) in three individuals from Brazil. The appendage on X-rays variously appeared as a prominent protrusion of the coccyx. On a physical examination, the appendage resembles a nodule-like stub of an animal tail.Finn and Lynch (2006), illustration, p. 243. Deficiencies such as mental retardation, learning disability, growth retardation and developmental delay are common. Psychiatric manifestations that have been reported with the syndrome include psychotic behavior, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder, loss of inhibition, hyperactivity, aggression, fear of physical contact, and compulsive actions like echolalia (repeating the words spoken by another person). Neuromuscular tics have also been noted. Urogenital abnormalities, or those affecting the urinary and reproductive systems, are common with the syndrome. Malpuech et al. (1983) and Kerstjens-Frederikse et al. (2005) reported variously in affected males a micropenis, hypospadias (a congenital mislocation of the urinary meatus), cryptorchidism (ectopic or undescended testes), bifid (split) and underdeveloped scrotum, and an obstructive urethral valve. An affected boy was also reported by Reardon et al. (2001) with left renal agenesis, an enlarged and downwardly displaced right kidney, cryptorchidism and a shawl scrotum. Other malformations that have been noted with the syndrome are omphalocele and an umbilical hernia. Diagram of a neonatal heart affected by PDA Congenital abnormalities of the heart have also been observed with Malpuech syndrome. From a healthy Japanese couple, Chinen and Naritomi (1995) described the sixth child who had features consistent with the disorder. This two-month-old male infant was also affected by cardiac anomalies including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and ventricular septal defect. The opening in the ductus arteriosus associated with PDA had been surgically repaired in the infant at 38 days of age. A number of minor skeletal aberrations were also reported in the infant, including wormian bones at the lambdoid sutures. Cause and genetics Malpuech facial clefting syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Malpuech syndrome, as with the other disorders within the 3MC syndrome consideration, is caused by mutations in the COLLEC11 and MASP1 genes. In an investigation by Rooryck et al. (2011), eleven families affected by 3MC syndrome were studied, which resulted in the identification of these two mutations. Both genes encode proteins of the lectin complement pathway, which plays a role in the complement system of innate, or non- specific immunity in humans and other species. The COLLEC11, or CL-K1 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p25.3) in humans. The CL-K1 protein is a C-type lectin, and belongs to the collectin family of these proteins. Other than its role in innate immunity, the protein is thought to be involved in the development of tissues including craniofacial cartilage, the heart and kidney during embryogenesis. This function in facial development was corroborated through study of the zebrafish, where mutations in its version of CL-K1 contributed to craniofacial abnormalities (such as Craniofacial clefts) possibly associated with errors in neural crest cell migration. The short and long arm of a typical human chromosome. The MASP1, or Mannan-binding Serine Protease I gene is located on the long arm of human chromosome 3 at 3q27-q28. The protein is a type of connectin called a mannan-binding lectin, which plays a role in innate immunity by binding to pathogens such as viruses including HIV. As described by Sirmaci et al. (2010), three Turkish individuals from two consanguineous families (the children of relatives such as cousins are said to be in a consanguineous family) with various characteristics of 3MC syndrome, including facial dysmorphism and a caudal appendage, were evaluated. Investigation of homologous chromosomes through gene mapping revealed an autozygous region (a location on a chromosome where both alleles of a gene originate from a common ancestor) at chromosome 3q27 in both families. In one family, a missense mutation in MASP1 at this location resulted in the replacement of the amino acid glycine by arginine at position 687 in the gene sequence. The mutation cosegregated with the observed phenotype. In individuals from the second family, DNA sequencing of MASP1 showed a nonsense mutation that resulted in a deactivation of tryptophan at position 290 in the gene, that also cosegregated with the phenotype. Both mutations occur in a form of MASP1 known to process IGFBP5; loss of this function associated with mutation of MASP1 causes disruptions in the availability of insulin-like growth factor during craniofacial and musculoskeletal development during the embryonic period. These results indicate that mutations in MASP1 are responsible for an array of features found with malformation disorders including Malpuech syndrome. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene(s) responsible for the disorder (COLLEC11, MASP1) is located on an autosome (chromosomes 2 and 3 are autosomes), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis It is suggested that the diagnostic criteria for Malpuech syndrome should include cleft lip and/or palate, typical associated facial features, and at least two of the following: urogenital anomalies, caudal appendage, and growth or developmental delay. Due to the relatively high rate of hearing impairment found with the disorder, it too may be considered in the diagnosis. Another congenital disorder, Wolf-Hirschhorn (Pitt-Rogers-Danks) syndrome, shares Malpuech features in its diagnostic criteria. Because of this lacking differentiation, karyotyping (microscopic analysis of the chromosomes of an individual) can be employed to distinguish the two. Whereas deletions in the short arm of chromosome 4 would be revealed with Wolf-Hirschhorn, a karyotype without this aberration present would favor a Malpuech syndrome diagnosis. Also, the karyotype of an individual with Malpuech syndrome alone will be normal. =Classification= Malpuech syndrome has been shown to have physical, or phenotypical similarities with several other genetic disorders. A report by Reardon et al. (2001) of a nine-year-old boy exhibiting facial, caudal and urogenital anomalies consistent with Malpuech syndrome, who also had skeletal malformites indicative of Juberg- Hayward syndrome, suggests that the two disorders may be allelic (caused by different mutations of the same gene). Along with several other disorders that have similar, or overlapping features and autosomal recessive inheritance, Malpuech syndrome has been considered to belong under the designation \\"3MC syndrome\\". Titomanlio et al. (2005) described a three-year-old female known to have Michels syndrome. In their review of the physical similarities between Michels, Malpuech and Mingarelli-Carnevale syndromes--particularly the facial appearance including instances of cleft lip and palate, and ptosis, and a similarity of congenital abdominal and urogenital anomalies--they believed the syndromes may represent a spectrum of genetic disorders rather than three individual disorders. They initially suggested this spectrum could be named 3MC (Michels-Malpuech-Mingarelli-Carnevale) syndrome. This conclusion and the name 3MC syndrome was supported by Leal et al. (2008), who reported a brother and sister with an array of symptoms that overlapped the various syndromes. Further assertion of 3MC syndrome was by Rooryck et al. (2011) in an elaboration of its cause. Management Many of the congenital malformations found with Malpuech syndrome can be corrected surgically. These include cleft lip and palate, omphalocele, urogenital and craniofacial abnormalities, skeletal deformities such as a caudal appendage or scoliosis, and hernias of the umbillicus. The primary area of concern for these procedures applied to a neonate with congenital disorders including Malpuech syndrome regards the logistics of anesthesia. Methods like tracheal intubation for management of the airway during general anesthesia can be hampered by the even smaller, or maldeveloped mouth of the infant. For regional anesthesia, methods like spinal blocking are more difficult where scoliosis is present. In a 2010 report by Kiernan et al., a four-year-old girl with Malpuech syndrome was being prepared for an unrelated tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. While undergoing intubation, insertion of a laryngoscope, needed to identify the airway for the placement of the endotracheal tube, was made troublesome by the presence of micrognathia attributed to the syndrome. After replacement with a laryngoscope of adjusted size, intubation proceeded normally. Successful general anesthesia followed. A rare follow-up of a male with Malpuech syndrome was presented by Priolo et al. (2007). Born at term from an uneventful pregnancy and delivery, the infant underwent a surgical repair of a cleft lip and palate. No problems were reported with the procedure. A heart abnormality, atrial septal defect, was also apparent but required no intervention. At age three years, mental retardation, hyperactivity and obsessive compulsive disorder were diagnosed; hearing impairment was diagnosed at age six, managed with the use of hearing aids. Over the course of the decade that followed, a number of psychiatric evaluations were performed. At age 14, he exhibited a fear of physical contact; at age 15, he experienced a severe psychotic episode, characterized by agitation and a loss of sociosexual inhibition. This array of symptoms were treated pharmocologically (with prescription medications). He maintained a low level of mental deficiency by age 17, with moments of compulsive echolalia. Epidemiology and history The incidence of Malpuech syndrome has not been determined. A 1999 report by Crisponi et al. suggested that only about 12 individuals worldwide were affected by the disorder at that time. The syndrome was first reported by Guilliaume Malpuech and colleagues in 1983, observed in four children of unspecified gender in what was described as a gypsy family. The children included three siblings and their first cousin; the family was known to be highly consanguineous.

He was a chaplain in the Royal Air Force during World War II, a senior lecturer at Jews' College and wrote a number of important books of Jewish interest. Biography and early education Cashdan was born in Starye Dorogi, Minsk, (then Russia and now) Belarus, the fifth child of Joseph and Bessie Cashdan. He came to Liverpool, UK in 1905, when 3 months old, with his mother and four siblings. (His father, Rabbi Joseph Cashdan, had come to the UK at an earlier date and worked in Liverpool as a rabbi and shohet). Eli, after attending school (at one of the first Jewish day schools in the UK, run by Dr S. Fox), went on to study at Liverpool Yeshiva (Liverpool Talmudical College; Yeshiva Torat Chaim) where he gained semikha from Rabbi Mordechai Yaacov Krasner at the very young age of 17. Cashdan studied law at London University and also attended Jews' College where in 1927 he obtained a first class honours degree in Semitics. He continued his law studies and was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1933. Cashdan also received an M.A. degree in Semitics from London University. In December 1930 Cashdan married Minnie Cohen whom he had met at the Rosh Pinah Youth Group he had set up. She was the elder daughter of Hyman Cohen (a businessman) and his wife, Clara, and they had two children, Basil (now deceased) and Evelyn. For some years the Cashdans lived in Hove, Sussex, after his appointment in 1956 to Jews' College he moved back to London and lived until his death in Hendon. Cashdan was a bibliophile and had an extensive collection of books of Jewish interest. Military career and Rabbinical and academic positions In 1941 Cashdan joined the Royal Air Force and he served as senior Jewish chaplain in Middle East until he was discharged in 1946 with the rank of wing commander. He took up an educational post as headmaster of the local Hebrew classes in Hove, Sussex until 1950 when he was appointed senior lecturer at Jews' College. Teaching Semitics and other Jewish academic subjects in Jews' College until his retirement in 1975, a generation of British Rabbis passed through his hands, including Chief Rabbis, Lord Jakobovits and Lord Sacks. Cashdan was a regular and popular teacher at the summer and winter schools of Jewish Youth Study Groups. Cashdan never served as a communal rabbi and although he had semikhahhe did not use the title rabbi until later on in his life. Publications Cashdan was one of a group of Anglo-Jewish scholars who worked for the Soncino Press and he contributed to the Soncino Books of the Bible series and the Soncino Press Babylonian Talmud. Cashdan wrote the introduction and commentary for the last three of the Minor Prophets: Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi. He translated and annotated Tractates Hullin and Menahot and, from the Minor Tractates (), Avoth DeRabbi Nathan. Cashdan wrote a new translation for the centenary edition of the Singer's Prayer Book the so-called \\"Cashdan Siddur\\", published in 1990. In 1997 Cashdan published a new translation for the Psalms. Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks wrote in the foreword to the translation, \\"Simple, direct, lucid and intelligible....it will allow these masterpieces of religious poetry to speak with their ageless power to a new generation\\".

To the west, it starts between the villages of Salhus and Frekhaug, where the Byfjorden meets the Herdlefjorden. To the east, the fjord ends between the village of Knarvik and the Hordvikneset peninsula, where the Osterfjorden runs northeast, the S√∏rfjorden runs southeast, and the Radfjorden runs north. The fjord is up to deep. It acts as one of the borders between the districts of Midhordland to the south and Nordhordland to the north. The islands of Holsn√∏y and Flat√∏y lie along the northern side of the fjord. Salhusfjorden is crossed by the Nordhordland Bridge, a combined pontoon and cable stayed bridge. Because of the depth, the bridge lacks lateral anchorage. The bridge, which carries European Route E39, was opened on 22 September 1994. It is the second-longest bridge in Norway. The fjord takes its name from the village area of Salhus, which during the Viking Age in the early 12th century there was an inn (known at the time as a s√°luhus), which would give name to the place. It acted as a transport hub for Nordhordland, and was a small market town. It was one of the first industrialized places when a hosiery manufacturer was established here in 1859. Previously, there were two ferry crossings of the Salhusfjorden. Starting on 7 July 1936, a ferry service ran between the villages of Isdalst√∏ and Steinest√∏.

Balaban Alexandru T. Balaban (born April 2, 1931, in Timi»ôoara) is a Romanian chemist who significantly contributed to the fields of organic chemistry, theoretical chemistry, mathematical chemistry, and chemical graph theory.  Early life and education  Balaban was born in Timi»ôoara, in the western part of Romania. His parents (Teodor and Florica Balaban) paid a lot of attention to Balaban's education, strongly encouraging his fascination with chemistry. In 1935 his family moved to Bucharest, where Balaban attended elementary school. After World War II, in 1945 they moved to Petro»ôani, where he finished high school. Alexandru Balaban enrolled the Politehnica University of Bucharest in 1949, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in chemistry on April 2, 1959. The topic of his Ph.D. thesis dealt with the restrictions catalyzed by anhydrous aluminium chloride.  Career  For more than forty years, professor Balaban held positions at the Chair of Organic Chemistry of the Politehnica University of Bucharest (assistant professor (1956-1960), associate professor (1961-1966) and full professor (1970-1999)). In addition, he was the head of the Laboratory of Isotopically Labelled Compounds of the Bucharest Institute of Atomic Physics from 1967 to 1974. In 1963, he was elected as Corresponding Member of the Romanian Academy, and in 1990 as Titular Member. From 1967 to 1970, he was appointed as a Senior Research Officer at the Chemistry Division, International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria, in charge with radiopharmaceuticals. From 1995 to 1998, he was acting as Vicepresident of the Romanian Academy. From 1991 to 2012, he was a tenured professor of chemistry at Texas A&M; University at Galveston. Since 2013, after his retirement, he has continued as Professor Emeritus at this university.  Research   Experimental organic chemistry  Professor Balaban has been investigating the synthesis and properties of pyrylium salts. He discovered with co-workers a new way of synthesis of pyrylium salts by diacylation of alkenes. This reaction is known as Balaban-Nenitzescu-Praill reaction. Nowadays, Balaban is recognized as a world authority in this field. He wrote the only existing book in this area. Balaban also developed new synthesis of oxazoles by AlCl3 catalyzed substitution of aromatic compounds with azlactones, followed by dehydration. In addition, he had been exploring new syntheses of indolizines and of naphthalene derivatives. In order to explain the extraordinary stability of hydrazyls such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl, Professor Balaban and his co-workers prepared related hydrazyls with lower steric shielding and accordingly lower stability. Then the first push-pull diarylaminyls were synthesized and shown to have stabilities depending both on electronic and steric effects. Another experimental research direction involves the synthesis of chelate compounds having boron as the central atom.  Theoretical chemistry  Professor Balaban had a permanent interest in theoretical chemistry. He is considered as one of pioneers of the Chemical Graph Theory. The first book about this interdisciplinary field was edited by Dr. Balaban and appeared in 1976: Chemical Applications of Graph Theory (Academic Press, London) and its Chinese translation in 1983. One area in which cubic (or trivalent) graphs play a dominant role is the enumeration of [n]annulene valence isomers (CH)n where n is an even number. With two coauthors, Dr. Balaban published in 1986 on this topic a 3-volume monograph (Annulenes, Benzo-, Hetero-, Homo-Derivatives and Their Valence Isomers, CRC Press). Some of these valence isomers undergo thermal or pohotochemical automerizations. More recently, Dr. Balaban edited in 1997 a book titled From Chemical Topology to Three-Dimensional Geometry, Plenum Publishing Corporation, in which various two- and three-dimensional nets were discussed. On using an approach similar to that imagined by Randiƒá for his connectivity index œá, but replacing the adjacency matrix by the distance matrix, and compensating graph-size-increase, a new topological index (TI) J was proposed under the name \\"average distance-based connectivity index\\"; it is now known as the \\"Balaban index\\". Not only is it much less degenerate than all previous TIs, but it allows a simple encoding for the presence of multiple bonds or heteroatoms. Other new TIs were studied: several TIs based on informational descriptors, and triplet-based indices that result from converting matrices into systems of linear equations. The Lewis acid- catalyzed syntheses of diamondoid hydrocarbons discovered by Schleyer proceed via multiple 1,2-rearrangements. The graph-theoretical analysis of the simplest such reaction involves an ethyl cation with five substituents which undergoes an automerization. This process is characterized by a 20-vertex or a 10-vertex graph depending whether one carbon atom of ethane is or is not labeled. These graphs constitute the first reaction graphs, in which vertices symbolize reaction intermediates and edges symbolize elementary reaction steeps.  Graph theory  Starting from the 10-vertex graph known as the 5-cage or the Petersen graph, Dr. Balaban observed relations among the known cages. Having discovered how a cage with smaller girth g was hidden in a cage with girth g + 1, Dr. Balaban published a paper on what was later proved to be the first 10-cage, known as the Balaban 10-cage. In 1973, he found the unique 11-cage, known as the Balaban 11-cage, as was proved by mathematicians using a lengthy computer search. Proposals made by Balaban about new possibilities for evaluating the performance of researchers, improving the way citations are used for this purpose (e. g., via the Hirsch index) included the use of author indexes of widely circulated treatises, or modifying the way one considers the impact factors of journals. Honoring invitations to contribute to special issues of journals dedicated to the philosophy of chemistry, Dr. Balaban published in Hyle an essay on how the \\"Sherlock Holmes principle\\" (if one eliminates the impossible, then whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must contain the truth) can be implemented by chemical graph theory which allows for instance to find all chemical isomers for a given formula.

He worked with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey and the FBI in building relations and providing outreach with the Muslim American community. He was involved in training over 7,000 members of the law enforcement community regarding Islamic culture and practices.Christie defends choice for Passaic judgeship by Robert Wiener, NJJN January 26, 2011First Call for Freedom By Kirsten Marcum, New Jersey Super Lawyers 2006 ‚Äî April 2006 He co-founded the American Muslim Union, an organization dedicated to cross-cultural understanding between Muslims and Americans. Mohammed represented dozens of detainees swept up by law enforcement after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. By 2003, he represented 29 individuals detained due to minor immigration law violations. Although none of these individuals faced charges of terrorism, the increase in immigration crackdown was a product of 9/11. In 2011, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie faced backlash from conservative bloggers and journalists for nominating a Muslim American to the bench. Journalist Steven Emerson accused Mohammed of being \\"a longtime mouthpiece for radical Islamists\\" for his brief representation of Mohammad Qatanani, imam of the Islamic Center of Passaic County, while he applied for a green card. However, the two ended the attorney-client relationship before his deportation case started. Qatanani hired another attorney, Claudia Slovinsky, to fight the deportation case in 2008. Blogger Pamela Geller accused Christie of being \\"in bed with the enemy\\" due to his nomination of Mohammed. In support of his appointment, Christie responded, \\"[i]t's just unnecessary to be accusing this guy of things just because of his religious background.\\" Sohail Mohammed was sworn into office in July 2011, becoming New Jersey's second Muslim judge.

The parents were estranged at the time of the delivery. The father filed for a preliminary injunction to be notified for when the mother would be in labor and to be present during the child's birth. No parties contended to the father's right to see the child after birth. Mohammed held that all patients, and pregnant women specifically, enjoy privacy protections that allow them to decide who can be at their hospital bedside. In May 2015, Mohammed issued a decision concerning twins born to different fathers, the result of a rare scientific phenomenon known as heteropaternal superfecundation. Mohammed ruled that the defendant in the case fathered only one twin and therefore was only responsible for paying child support for that child.

OCADS was re-designated as the 4752d ADS briefly in 1960‚Äì61, then taken over by the 32d Air Division in 1961‚Äì63 before being returned to its designation in 1963. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-52. In 1963 the station became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with Oklahoma City AFS using AN/FPS-67 search and AN/FPS-6 height-finder radars. OCADS was re- established in 1963 and was re-designated as Manual Combat Center (MCC-11)/NORAD Sector Combat Center (Manual). In 1965 the search radar was upgraded to the AN/FPS-67B variant. On 1 April 1966 OCADS was again re- designated as the 31st Air Division The Air Force closed MCC-11 on 31 December 1969 due to budget reductions. The FAA continues to operate the AN/FPS-67B search radar today as part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS). After ADCOM ceased operations at Oklahoma City AFS, its facilities were occupied by Air Force Communications Service (AFCS), which activated its Southern Communications Area (SCA), a headquarters for all AFCS units in the southern states of the United States except for those located on Tactical Air Command bases, which were assigned to Tactical Communications Area. Although only AFCS units were located on the station, it was considered an off-base station of Tinker and belonged to Air Force Logistics Command. On 1 October 1983 the station merged with Tinker AFB and lost its status as a separate installation. In June 1976, SCA was reduced in size as it lost its squadrons on Strategic Air Command stations to the new Strategic Communications Area SCA was inactivated on 1 June 1981 in a major reorganization of AFCS (now named Air Force Communications Command), as all communications units in the US that were not assigned to combat commands were reassigned to Continental Communications Division at Griffiss AFB, New York. However, at the same time, all USAF units responsible for engineering and installing ground communications-electronics systems worldwide were assigned to AFCC's Engineering Installation Center, which took over the facilities of SCA. The EI Center became a Division in 1985 and was renamed the Communications Systems Center in 1991. As AFCC lost its Major Command status and communications functions were transferred to the other commands, the Communications Systems Center was reassigned to the Electronic Systems Center of Air Force Materiel Command in October 1993 and was inactivated in 1994 as its mission was transferred to the 38th Electronic Installation Wing. As mission needs were reduced the 38th EIW was inactivated in 2000Robertson, Patsy AFHRA Factsheet, 38th Combat Support Wing 6/4/2008 (retrieved March 9, 2013) and its group remained the only unit on the former station.

Fen peat formed in an area colonised by reeds and rushes. Sphagnum mosses then colonised the area causing a change from fen to bog peat which became elevated forming a dome, the raised bog. Sphagnum mosses increase the acidity of the water resulting in highly specialised plant species, many of them found nowhere else.

It existed from 1851 to 1932, and was notable as the first paper to use photos. Inaugurated in 1851, three years after the founding of the city, the Witness was originally a four-page fortnightly paper, becoming a weekly publication within its first year. It was named the Otago Witness to indicate the city's connection with Edinburgh, where the Edinburgh Witness was a popular paper. The Witness was the country's first newspaper to start publishing photos from the mid-1850s, which gained it popularity through its introduction of illustrations. This forms the basis of the Otago image collection, which since 2006 has been digitising these historic photos. The Witness' early issues gained some notoriety for its polemical editorials, which were often skewed in favour of the political views and policies of Dunedin founding father Captain William Cargill, but soon became a more balanced journal and was widely distributed throughout the South Island, especially after the boom in Otago's wealth and population which followed the 1861 Central Otago Gold Rush. During this time a special gold fields edition of the paper was regularly published. One female writer, Louisa Alice Baker, became known as 'Dot' giving advice to children. She moved to England in 1894, but continued to write for the Witness from there. Associate editor Eileen Louise Soper wrote for the children's pages for eight years, starting in the 1920s, and served as Dot of 'Dot's Little Folk' until 1932. The popularity of the Witness declined during the early twentieth century due to competition from other forms of broadcast, notably radio and the newspaper's daily rivals, the Otago Daily Times and Evening Star. The Witness eventually stopped publication in 1932.

He was an Armenian and his name is occasionally rendered as Charanges (). He is only known for his activities in the Gothic War, in particular the Battle of the Volturnus in 554. The main source about him is Agathias.. The name probably derives from KanƒÅrang, a military title of the Sassanid Empire. He should probably not be confused with his contemporary, the Chanaranges who took part in the conspiracy of Artabanes.. Biography Chanaranges was reportedly a native of Byzantine Armenia. Agathias gives his title in Greek as taxiarch (), describing him as commanding a tagma. His Latin title was probably comes rei militaris. He is first mentioned in late 554, serving under Narses. His forces took part in a campaign against the Franks of Butilinus. Narses set his camp near the river Casilinum (Volturnus, Volturno). Chanaranges was stationed in the same camp, at the side nearest to the enemy. Chanaranges was sent against the supply wagons of the Franks. He easily captured the wagons and killed the drivers. The Franks had built a tower in the area, guarding the bridge that crossed the river. Chanaranges drove one of the captured wagons to the castle. He set the wagon on fire, the flames spreading to the tower and destroying it. The bridge passed under Byzantine control. The events directly led to the Battle of the Volturnus, a decisive Byzantine victory. Nothing further is known of him after that.; . Agathias describes Chanaranges as very brave and ready to take risks, but also as sufficiently cautious to avoid unnecessary dangers.

The cast iron clock's design incorporates a bell-cast shaped column base and an anthemion finial above the dial casing. The clock originally was installed at 161-11 Jamaica Avenue,http://www.neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/81-161-11-SIDEWWALK- CLOCK.pdf but was moved in 1989. The current location is the site of a Chase Manhattan Bank Building, which was previously the site of a former pre- colonial stone church that existed from 1699 to 1813, and which was converted into a prison during the American Revolution. The clock was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Old stone church The Sugar House and Middle Dutch Church became a prison as the British captured Washington's soldiers during the retreat from New York in 1776. The site today is the location of the Chase Manhattan Bank. The village of Jamaica, settled by a band of English people, was granted a charter for ‚ÄúRustdorp‚Äù by Governor Stuyvesant in 1656. Six years later, about 25 families of these settlers joined together to make this church. At a town meeting the same year it was voted to build a parsonage, 26 ft. long and 17 ft. wide, a large house for the time and place, the whole town being assessed for the cost. This parsonage served as the house for a few years until the town church was built in the last decade of the 17th century. The new meeting house was variously called : ‚ÄúThe Town Church,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Stone Church‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Church.‚Äù It stood on the main street of the village not far from the present corner of Fulton Street and New York Avenue (Guy Brewer) at the head of Meeting House Lane (Union Hall St.) It was used by all congregations for worship, as a town hall and as a court house for many years. For most of the 18th century the ‚ÄúOld Trail‚Äù along Jamaica avenue would make this area a trading post for farmers and their produce, with horse-drawn carts found up and down ‚ÄúKings Highway‚Äù.https://gjdc.org/our- story/jamaica-history/ When Lord Cornbury became governor, he placed the church and the parsonage at the disposal of the congregation of the Church of England on the grounds that the building had been paid for by public taxation. The Episcopalians then refused the other congregations the use of it. Whereupon, the Presbyterians brought suit and recovered both the parsonage and the church, which they continued to use until the new building was built in 1813. In the foundations of this building on 163rd st are some of the stones of the old church.https://www.jstor/stable/43564781historical sketch of the first Presbyterian church in Jamaica, new York, Anna Elizabeth Foote ‚Äì Quarterly journal of the New York State historical association vol 5 no.4 (October, 1924), pp.342-343 pub by Fenimore Art Museum Jamaica Avenue clock Originally erected in 1900 at 161-11 Jamaica Avenue, the clock was designated a New York City landmark in 1981.

The descriptive plaque was installed in the wall of the bank building below the one placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution for the Old stone church. Originally placed in front of Busch's Jewellers, it is 15 feet high to the top of the finial, and was similar to other cast-iron post (tower) clocks produced between 1881 and 1910 by the E. Howard Clock Company and the Seth Thomas Clock Company. The clocks were manufactured and sold from catalogs for about $600 () and had weight-driven mechanisms, so there is no relation to installed date and date of manufacture. They operated for approximately 8 days calculated according to the distance in feet needed for a weight to fall after it was wound up to the top of the mechanism. Designs varied, with 2 and 4 faced clocks being typical, the basic compositions were mounted on classical columns and bases. The description for the Jamaica clock: \\"double-faced sidewalk clock with a paneled base, fluted column post on a bell-shaped pedestal with an anthemion Finial motif above the clock-face\\" describes one that was not in the Howard or Seth Thomas catalogs and may be from a different manufacturer. One possible source is the Hecla Iron Works of Williamsburg.https://www.brownstoner.com/architecture/brooklyn- architecture-williamsburg-hecla-iron-works-110-north-11th-street/ At one point in the clock's lifetime the words 'Tad's Steaks' were added in neon and subsequently removed during restoration. The anthemion finial was used in neo- classical Greek and Roman architecture to embellish various parts of ancient buildings. The fronds of an anthemion, which means honeysuckle, tend to curl inward.https://www.marymaycarving.com/carvingschool/2018/02/14/carving-an- anthemion/https://www.decorartsnow.com/design-dictionary-anthemion-and- palmette/ References External links * *Report, Landmarks Preservation Commission, 1981 *Flickr.com Category:Buildings and structures in Queens, New York Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New York City Category:Clocks in the United States Category:Jamaica, Queens Category:National Register of Historic Places in Queens, New York Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Queens, New York ","title":"Sidewalk clock on Jamaica Avenue"},{"id":"30542643","text":"Albert Fredrik Eggen (29 September 1878 ‚Äì 1966) was a Norwegian farmer and politician for the Liberal Party.

In his recent past, a woman, Roisin, had been caught by the Libyans, and found out as a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operative. Under the torture, and shortly before her execution, she had claimed Paul Shanhaan was also a sleeper member of the CIA. As such, all his terrorist contacts had shunned him, expecting him to return to the United States, as his cover was blown. As the story begins, he has been in the cold for three years, when he is contacted by an old Libyan contact, with a job for him. The job, on the face of it, is to sail a boat carrying five million dollars of Libyan gold, to Miami, to allow the PIRA to give it as payment to the Cubans, in exchange for fifty-two Stinger missiles.

JUL. 1976. There was a dispute between this Church and the Grace Episcopal Church (founded in 1701) in regard to which church would maintain the cemetery. The dispute went back to 1704, When Lord Cornbury became governor, he confiscated the church and the parsonage in Jamaica village and placed them at the disposal of the congregation of the Anglican Church on the grounds that the building had been paid for by public taxation. The Episcopalians then refused the other congregations the use of it. Whereupon, the Presbyterians brought suit and recovered both the parsonage and the church, which they continued to use until the present edifice was built in 1813 on 164th street at 90th ave. Cornbury's fortunes and that of the Whigs had turned by 1709 when he was accused of persecution of the Presbyterians by confiscating church property and imprisoning their ministers, there was much violence during that period relating to land grabs in New York and elsewhere. =Early arrivals= The cemetery includes approximately 240 family plots containing 2,100 burials and date from the founding of the cemetery to the late 20th century.

Coombs (1878-1939)Bowdoin Alumnus June 1939: 140. was an American architect practicing in Lewiston, Maine. He was the son of and successor to architect George M. Coombs. Biography Harry Coombs was born in 1878 to George M. Coombs, a partner in the leading Lewiston architectural firm of Stevens & Coombs. He attended the public schools, before moving on to Bowdoin College. He graduated in 1901, and immediately entered his father's office, now Coombs & Gibbs. He worked with his father until his death in May 1909, at which point he gained his father's share in the partnership.. 1986. Coombs & Gibbs was dissolved sometime in 1910, breaking into two firms, Coombs Brothers and Gibbs & Pulsifer. Coombs Brothers was composed of Harry Coombs and his brother, Frederick N. Coombs.The Architects' Directory and Specification Index. 1913. They split in 1912, and Harry continued on his own. In 1928 he made Alonzo J. Harriman a partner,Pencil Points 1944: 40. and Coombs & Harriman lasted until the former's death in 1939. Legacy After Coombs' death, Harriman relocated the office to Auburn, where it is still in operation as Harriman Architects + Engineers. At least nine of his designs have been individually placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and several others contribute to listed historic districts. Style Prior to the 1930s, almost all of Coombs' work was in the Colonial Revival style. Larger examples of this are his administration building at the Central Maine General Hospital, the Rumford Municipal Building, Stearns High School at Millinocket, and the former Lewiston High School. He designed very few Gothic Revival buildings, and those that are known were all built in the first few years of his practice. Of these, the Franklin School in Auburn is most notable. Beginning in the 1930s, Coombs and his partner Harriman began to adopt the Art Deco style for many of their works, most significantly the hospital at Togus and the since-demolished High School at Brunswick.

XL-14 Maya was a single-engine, light experimental aircraft designed and built in the Republic of the Philippines in the early 1950s to investigate the use of indigenous materials in aircraft construction. Its construction uses a type of woven bamboo. Design and development In the early 1950s in the Republic of the Philippines, the Institute of Science and Technology (I.S.T., previously known as the Bureau of Science) designed at least three different prototypes, both to investigate the scope for local aircraft design and production and to examine the use of indigenous materials in their construction. One such material of interest was Wobex (Woven bamboo experimental), a reinforced woven bamboo. The XL-14 Maya (until 1995 the maya was the national bird of the Philippines) was the first of this series of prototypes. It was a single-engine, high-wing monoplane of standard layout except for its twin tail. The wing had constant chord and was built around two parallel, solid spars and wooden ribs. The leading edges were covered and reinforced with Wobex and the rest of the wing was fabric covered. The centre section was integral with the cabin top and the outer wings were braced on each side with V struts from the wing spars to the lower fuselage. Ailerons and slotted flaps were fitted. It had a strut braced tailplane, set slightly above the fuselage top on a short pylon. The tailplane carried almost rectangular endplate fins and rudders. The tail structure was wooden with fabric covering. The Maya had a semi-monocoque fuselage with wooden stringers and Wobex mat covering. The cabin stood above the rear fuselage line, enclosing side-by-side seats with a third, occasional seat, or luggage space, behind. In front a 75 kW (100 hp) Lycoming flat four engine, with cylinder- heads exposed, drove a two blade propeller. It had a conventional undercarriage, with each mainwheel mounted on V-struts and half axles hinged to the fuselage central underside via rubber shock absorbers. The fixed tailwheel was steerable. The date of the Maya's first flight is not known, though the aircraft was complete by May 1955 and a later design, the XL-15 Tagak was being flight tested by October 1954. Only one Maya was built, for although it was described as being suitable for agricultural use and for utility and observation work, its function was always as a constructional material experimental aircraft.

In 2017, its president was Maurice Hamon and its deputy head was Christophe Marion.  Original remit  While he was Minister of Public Instruction, Fran√ßois Guizot was much occupied with what he described in his report of 31 December 1833 as the \\"systematic publication of all significant materials about the history of our country which are still unedited.\\" To this end he established a committee on 18 July 1834, charged with directing research into documents and, with the support of public funds, their publication in its journal Documents in√©dits de l‚ÄôHistoire de France. On 10 January 1835 a second committee was set up to undertake research and publication of documents in literature, philosophy, the arts and the sciences which are of significance to general history. A Historic Works Bureau was established by Hippolyte Royer-Collard in the Science and Letters section of the Ministry to manage the committees.  Historical development  In 1875, the committee came under the authority of the Ministry of Higher Education. On 5 March 1881, the committee assumed its current name and was divided into two sections, one for history, archaeology and philology, and the second with the sciences, each having its own publication commission. It had 90 members and 200 corresponding members.http://www.cths.fr/hi/historique.php In 1883 it was divided again, into five sections - history and philology; archaeology; economic and social sciences; mathematical sciences,physics, chemistry and meteorology; and natural and geographic sciences. A reform in 1956, created a new structure - archaeology; geography; modern and contemporary history; philology and history to 1715; sciences; and economic and social sciences. In 1983, the sections were reorganised and amalgamated - history of science and technology; prehistory and early history; French anthropology and ethnology. In 2000, the structure was designated as follows: * 1. Prehistory and early history section - 25 members * 2. Archaeology and ancient civilisation - 30 members * 3. History and philology of medieval civilisation - 25 members * 4. Archaeology and art history of medieval and modern civilisation - 25 members * 5. History of the modern world, the French Revolution and other revolutions - 30 members * 6. Contemporary history - 30 members * 7. Social anthropology, ethnology and regional languages - 20 members * 8. Science, history of science and technology and industrial archaeology - 45 members * 9. Geographical and environmental sciences - 25 members Each section meets between four and six times per year. Members, whether French or foreign, have the right to take part in meetings and to vote. Corresponding members, Emeritus members and non- members may be invited to attend meetings, but do not vote. In 2005, an order from the Minister of Higher Education and Research brought the Committee within the remit of the √âcole nationale des chartes, though its sectional structure was left unchanged.  Activities  * Since 1834 the CTHS has published works of research and higher education. Each year, numerous new items appear and are distributed by the Association Fran√ßaise des Presses d‚ÄôUniversit√© - Diffusion (AFPU-D) and distributed by Sodis. * Each year, the Historic and scientific Societies' conference is held in a French-speaking university town.

Coombs in Classical Revival style and built in 1915. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The library underwent a major renovation and expansion in 2003. Architecture and history The Oakland Public Library stands on the east side of Church Street in Oakland's central village. It is a handsome Classical Revival single-story brick building, covered by a hip roof. Its front is three bays wide, with a projecting entry vestibule. Stairs lead up to a recessed entrance, flanked by concrete columns and wide brick corner pilasters. This is topped by a full modillioned pediment, whose cornice detail encircles the building. The windows in the side bays have three sections, with a bracketed sill. with Oakland's library was founded in 1891, and was originally located in Memorial Hall. By 1911, it had outgrown the space available there, and a local businessman petitioned Andrew Carnegie for a grant to build a dedicated building. Carnegie rejected the first request, apparently under the mistaken apprehension that the Memorial Hall space was sufficient for the library's needs. In 1912, he acceded to make a grant, provided the town would ensure its maintenance. The Carnegie Foundation and the town committee then had further exchanges related to the building's design, and it was not until 1914 that the plans of architect Harry S. Coombs were finally approved. Land for the new library was donated by Alice Benjamin and it was completed in 1915. Built to house 4,000 volumes, the collection had grown by the 1990s to more than 16,000 books. In 2003, the size of the library was doubled, providing handicap accessibility and improved parking.

Donaukurier, accessed 17/3/2018 was an English physicist and telescope optics designer, best known for pioneering the use of active optics in large telescopes.  Biography  Wilson's first degree was in physics from the University of Birmingham, followed by studying engineering at Imperial College London.Ray Wilson section of 2010 Astrophysics Laureate Biographies, Kavli Foundation website, accessed 23/01/2011 After completing national service in 1952, he resumed his work on optics. He then worked at Imperial College and at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. From around 1961, he spent 11 years as Head of the Design Department for telescopes at Carl Zeiss AG in Oberkochen, Germany. In 1972 he became Head of the Optics and Telescopes Group at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), where he worked for the next 21 years, first in Geneva and then in Garching, Germany. His major contributions have been in telescope optics and technology. In particular, he developed the concept of active optics, which is now the basic principle on which modern large telescopes are constructed. The concept of active optics was developed first in ESO's New Technology Telescope (first light 1988), and then in ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT). (first light 1998). Wilson retired in 1993, writing a two-volume monograph Reflecting Telescope Optics, a leading work in the field. He also extended the design of large telescopes to the next-generation designs that use three, four, and five mirrors. Wilson's other interests included history, economics, cosmology and biology.

If built, it would be long and have a main span of . This would make it the longest spanned bridge in the world, easily surpassing the Akashi-Kaiky≈ç Bridge, which has a main span of . The plans have been developed by Aas-Jakobsen for a Storfjordsambandet, a company which aims to toll finance the bridge. According to Rolf M. Larssen of Aas-Jakobsen, there is a larger challenge securing sufficient funding than technically building the bridge. It is estimated to cost 4.3 billion Norwegian krone. History In a report made by Aas-Jakobsen, two crossings were discussed, one slightly in-fjord from the ferry and one which would cross to √òrskog. The bridge would have a single main cable and a split bridge beam. The cable would run down the centre of the bridge, with the lanes on each side of an open area with cross-sections. While this method is more expensive, it allows for a more aerodynamic bridge. The bridge would have two pylons, with the road lanes crossing on the outside of the pylons. Each pylon would be tall. The pylons would be round with a diameter of between . The northern pylon would be anchored in bedrock, while the southern pylon would be anchored in a caisson in bedrock, located below mean sea level. The distance between the middle of the lanes would be at the pylons, and at the middle of the bridge. The main cable would be above the sea at the pylons and above the sea at the middle. The bridge allows a clearance below of , wide. The crossing would establish a fixed link for Sykkylven and Stranda towards √Ölesund. The service is currently operated by the √òrsneset‚ÄìMagerholm Ferry on National Road 60, which had an average daily traffic of 1967 cars and 175 in 2009, making it the fifth-most trafficked ferry service in Norway. Former proposals for the crossing has included a submerged floating tunnel and a pontoon bridge, although both have since been discarded. The design is part of a project initiated by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration to develop extreme technology which would make it possible to make E39, the Coastal Highway, ferry free. Official plans by the Road Administration have suggested that a different bridge, Sulafjord Bridge, over Sulafjorden further west to be built instead of the Storfjord Bridge.E39 Sulafjorden, fjordkrysning This bridge is still of a similar size.

Family John Fogge, born about 1417, was the son of John Fogge, esquire, the second surviving son of Sir Thomas Fogge (d. 13 July 1407) and Joan de Valence (d. 8 July 1420),According to Pearman she died in 1425. widow of William Costede of Costede, Kent, and daughter of Sir Stephen de Valence of Repton. Fogge's mother was possibly Joan Leigh. Career According to Horrox, Fogge had reached the age of majority by 1438, but only came to prominence when he inherited the lands of the senior line on the death of Sir Thomas's grandson and heir, William' by February 1447. Fogge was an esquire to Henry VI by 1450, and in that year was involved in the suppression of the rebellion of Jack Cade. He was appointed Sheriff of Kent in November 1453. He was made Comptroller of the Household in 1460 under Henry VI, and knighted the following year. Despite his earlier service under Henry VI, when the future Edward IV landed in England in June 1460, Fogge joined the Yorkists, and was granted Tonford in Thanington and Dane Court in Boughton under Blean, manors to which he claimed to be entitled by reversion. After the Yorkist victory at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461, 'Fogge emerged as a leading royal associate in Kent, heading all commissions named in the county'. In 1461 he was granted the office of Keeper of the Writs of the Court of Common Pleas, and took part in the investigation of the possible treason of Sir Thomas Cooke, Lord Mayor of London. He was Treasurer of the Household to Edward IV from 1461 to 1468, as well as a member of the King's council, and in March 1462 he and others were granted custody of the lands of John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, forfeited to the crown as a result of the Earl's attainder. In 1469 it was alleged that Fogge was among those whose 'covetous rule and gydynge' had brought Edward IV and the kingdom to 'great poverty and misery'. In 1461 and 1463 he was elected to Parliament as Knight of the Shire for Kent, and in 1467 as MP for Canterbury. He was sheriff of Kent in 1472 and 1479. According to Horrox, his name is not found in commissions during the Readeption of Henry VI, suggesting the possibility that he went into exile with Edward IV. When Edward IV regained the throne, Fogge was rewarded for his loyalty with grants of land, as well as a grant for twelve years of gold and silver mines in Devon and Cornwall. During this period Fogge built close ties to the Prince of Wales, and from 1473 was a member of his council and administrator of his property. He was made Chamberlain jointly with Sir John Scott. He again represented Kent in parliament in 1478 and 1483. In 1483 the future Richard III of England appointed himself Protector of Edward IV's young son and heir, Edward V, accusing the Woodvilles of plotting against him. Sir Thomas More says that Fogge took sanctuary at this time, and that Richard III was prepared to treat him with favour. Despite this apparent reconciliation, Fogge supported Richard Guildford in Kent against Richard III, a rising in support of Edward V, and became part of the unsuccessful Buckingham's rebellion. The rising was blocked at Gravesend by John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk, and the rebel force retreated. Fogge was attainted, and much of his property was granted to Sir Ralph Ashton, who had been loyal to the King, and who was already in conflict with Fogge over a portion of the Kyriell inheritance from Fogge's first marriage. In February 1485 Fogge bound himself to good behaviour and was pardoned, and four of his manors were returned to him. Fogge was a supporter of Henry Tudor, and reportedly played a role in the Battle of Bosworth Field. As a result, his lands which had been taken during Richard III's reign were restored when Henry VII came to power. After Henry VII's accession, however, perhaps because of advancing age, Fogge played little part in national affairs. Fogge left a will dated 15 July 1490,According to Horrox, his will is dated 9 July 1490. and had died by 9 November of that year. He built and endowed the church at Ashford, Kent as well as the College at Ashford. He was buried beneath a handsome altar-tomb in the church, where he is also commemorated in a memorial window. The Fogge arms were Argent on a fess between three annulets sable three mullets pierced of the first. The crest was a unicorn's head, argent. At the Siege of Rouen in 1418, a Thomas Fogge who was likely his great great uncle, carried the same arms differenced by having unpierced mullets. Literary references A character named 'Jon Fogge', who appears to be based on this knight, appears in Marjorie Bowen's 1929 novel Dickon about the life of Richard III. In the novel he serves as a sort of sinister shadow, portending the violent fate of the king. Marriages and issue Fogge married firstly, by the early 1440s, Alice de Criol or Kyriell, daughter of the Yorkist soldier Sir Thomas de Criol of Westenhanger, beheaded after the Second Battle of St Albans by order of Margaret of Anjou. The marriage brought him Westenhanger Castle. They had a son and heir, *John Fogge (d.1501), who married Joanne Leigh, daughter of Sir Richard Leigh Lord Mayor of London, (1460, 1469). Their son, **Sir John Fogge (d.1533), Marshal of Calais and Sheriff of Kent, married Margaret Goldwell, daughter of Jeffrey Goldwell (brother of James Goldwell, Bishop of Norwich), by whom he had three sons and three daughters: ***Sir John Fogge (d.1564) of Repton in Ashford, Kent, eldest son, Sheriff of Kent in 1545, who married firstly Margaret Brooke, the daughter of Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham (d. 19 July 1529) by his first wife, Dorothy Heydon, and secondly Catherine, the daughter of one Holand of Calais. ***William Fogge (d.1535) of Canterbury, buried in Canterbury Cathedral. ***George Fogge (died c.1591) of Brabourne and Repton, who married firstly Margaret Kempe (daughter of Sir William Kempe of Olantigh by his second wife, Eleanor Browne, widow of (see below) Thomas Fogge (d. 16 August 1612), and daughter and heir of Robert Browne, son of Sir Thomas Browne of Betchworth Castle), and secondly Honor Palmer, daughter of Sir Thomas Palmer. ***Margaret Fogge, who married Sir Humphrey Stafford. - but see below ***Abigail Fogge, who married Cranmer Brooke (died c.1547) of Ashford, son of Thomas Brooke (third son of Thomas Brooke, 8th Baron Cobham (d. 19 July 1529)), and Susan Cranmer, niece of Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. ***Daughter whose name is not given in the Fogge pedigree.

Richard Woodville was also the father of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and the grandfather of Elizabeth Woodville, and Fogge's second wife, Alice Haute was thus Elizabeth Woodville's first cousin. After her marriage to Edward IV, Elizabeth Woodville brought her favourite female relatives to court. Fogge's second wife, Alice Haute, was one of her five ladies-in-waiting during the 1460s. By Alice Haute, Fogge had a son and three daughters: *Thomas Fogge (d. 16 August 1512), esquire, of Ashford, Great Mongeham, Sutton Farm (in Sutton), Tunford (in Thanington), and Walmer, Kent, Sergeant Porter of Calais to Henry VII and Henry VIII. He married before 9 December 1509 Eleanor Browne, daughter of Robert Browne, esquire, and granddaughter of Sir Thomas Browne. They had two daughters, Alice (wife of Edward Scott and Robert Oxenbridge, Knt.) and Anne (wife of William Scott and Henry Isham). He was buried in the church at Ashford. He left a will dated 4 August 1512, proved 16 October 1512 (P.C.C. 9 Fetiplace). *Anne Fogge. *Elizabeth Fogge. *Margaret Fogge, who married her father's ward, Sir Humphrey Stafford (d. 22 September 1545) of Cottered and Rushden, Hertfordshire, by whom she was the mother of three sons and three daughters, including Sir Humphrey Stafford, who married Margaret Tame, daughter of Sir Edmund Tame, and Sir William Stafford, who married Mary Boleyn. Stafford was the son of Humphrey Stafford (died 1486). Many sources state that Sir Thomas Greene married Fogge's daughter, Jane, by whom he was the father of Maud Green, mother of Catherine Parr. However Fogge's will, as transcribed by Pearman, states that he has three daughters, Anne, Elizabeth and Margaret, and makes no mention of a daughter Jane. The official biographers of Catherine Parr, Susan E. James and Linda Porter, state that Jane Fogge was the granddaughter of Sir John Fogge, knt.

He was the first Australian pianist to record the complete series of 32 piano sonatas by Ludwig van Beethoven. He also recorded Beethoven's five piano concertos, the Diabelli Variations, C minor variations, Andante favori, F√ºr Elise and the 3 Electoral \\"Kurf√ºrstensonaten\\" sonatas as well as a reconstructed \\"Fantasy Sonata in D\\". These recordings feature the Australian designed and manufactured Stuart & Sons piano. This series of recordings constitutes the largest classical music recording project ever undertaken in Australia, and Willems became the best selling classical artist in Australia's recording history. Biography Willems was born and grew up in Tilburg, Netherlands. He was named after his maternal grandfather, a church organist, composer and piano builder. He received a scholarship from the Brabant Conservatorium, but the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 caused his parents, fearful of a domino effect, to migrate to Australia when he was 12, in 1958. Until he was 17, they lived in a migrant camp near Wollongong; his father died in the camp. He entered the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, studying under Gordon Watson. After graduation, he was called up for national service, managing to convince the army he was best suited as a musician, and he played the clarinet in army bands. Willems was employed as the touring pianist for the Australian Ballet, and travelled on tours with dancers such as Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov. He won the Queen Victoria Piano Competition, and later studied under Greville Rothon (assistant to Claudio Arrau) in Munich. He made debuts in London 1974, Munich 1977 and Amsterdam 1978. He returned to Sydney in 1981 and has taught as senior lecturer, and later chair of the Keyboard Unit, at the Sydney Conservatorium 1981‚Äì2008 and is currently an associate professor at Sydney University. He founded the piano trio Mozartrois, and with them recorded the complete Mozart piano trios, as part of the bicentenary of Mozart's death in 1991. He has appeared in lieder recitals and chamber music concerts. In 1996, former television producer Brendan Ward persuaded Willems to record Beethoven's 32 piano sonatas.pp.88-96 These recordings (12 CDs) were released by the ABC in 3 volumes in 1998, 1999 and 2000. They won successive ARIA Music Awards, in 1999 and 2000, the first time a pianist won the Classical section of the Awards. In 2001, he won the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Australian Musical Scholarship.

The title page shows a compass rose with the names of twelve winds. Elucidarium (also Elucidarius, so called because it \\"elucidates the obscurity of various things\\") is an encyclopedic work or summa about medieval Christian theology and folk belief, originally written in the late 11th century by Honorius Augustodunensis, influenced by Anselm of Canterbury and John Scotus Eriugena. It was probably complete by 1098, as the latest work by Anselm that finds mention is Cur deus homo. This suggests that it is the earliest work by Honorius, written when he was a young man. It was intended as a handbook for the lower and less educated clergy. Valerie Flint (1975) associates its compilation with the 11th-century Reform of English monasticism. Overview The work is set in the form of a Socratic dialogue between a disciple and his teacher, divided in three books. The first discusses God, the creation of angels and their fall, the creation of man and his fall and need for redemption, and the earthly life of Christ. The second book discusses the divine nature of Christ and the foundation of the Church at Pentecost, understood as the mystical body of Christ manifested in the Eucharist dispensed by the Church. The third book discusses Christian eschatology. Honorius embraces this last topic with enthusiasm, with the Antichrist, the Second Coming, the Last Judgement, Purgatory, the pains of Hell and the joys of Heaven described in vivid detail. The work was very popular from the time of its composition and remained so until the end of the medieval period. The work survives in more than 300 manuscripts of the Latin text (Flint 1995, p. 162). The theological topic is embellished with many loans from the native folklore of England, and was embellished further in later editions and vernacular translations. Written in the 1090s in England, it was translated into Anglo-Saxon within a few years of its completion (Southern 1991, p. 37). It was frequently translated into vernaculars and survives in numerous disparate versions, from the 16th century also in print in the form of popular chapbooks. Later versions attributed the work to a \\"Master Elucidarius\\". A Proven√ßal translation revises the text for compatibility with Catharism. An important early translation is that into Old Icelandic, dated to the late 12th century. The Old Icelandic translation survives in fragments in a manuscript dated to c. 1200 (AM 647a), one of the very earliest surviving Icelandic manuscripts. This Old Icelandic Elucidarius was an important influence on medieval Icelandic literature and culture, including the Snorra Edda. The editio princeps of the Latin text is that of the Patrologia Latina, vol. 172 (Paris 1895). Versions ; High Middle Ages * An Old Icelandic version of ca. 1200.

Description Lygus pratensis Lygus pratensis can reach a length of in males, of in females. The color pattern and markings of these plant bugs vary greatly. Color may be green, brown or reddish. Usually the males are light reddish-brown to dark red, while the females are green and brownish-colored. The body is oval in shape and slightly flattened. The scutellum is heart-shaped in both sexes. The wings are clearly visible, as they are not completely covered by the hemielytra. Eyes, legs and antennae are usually reddish. These bugs can be identified mainly on the basis of the fine details of the corium.British Bugs This species is very similar to Lygus wagneri, but usually it is slightly larger, has longer membrane and a more densely pubescent corium. It is also quite similar to Lygus maritimus and Lygus rugulipennis. Biology Nymph of Lygus pratensis Lygus pratensis is a sap-sucking species. Both the larvae and the adults suck the juice of different herbaceous plants, but also nectar of flowers (especially of Leucanthemum vulgare and Tanacetum vulgare). They are polyphagous, mainly feeding on juices of Ranunculus acris, Raphanus raphanistrum, Linaria vulgaris, Calluna vulgaris and of various Asteraceae species, but also on Aphididae species. This species is considered a pest. Adults are present all year, with one or two generations. The adult insects overwinter in the litter, in moss or under barks. The females lay their eggs in May and June in flower buds or other plant parts. The tiny eggs are round and white and are deposited in groups. The larvae initially are small, round and bright. In the later stages the larvae are completely green and they can easily be confused with aphids. They grow quickly and are very harmful for the plants. A good biological control is represented by the parasitic wasps of the genus Peristenus that actively seek the nymphs and lay an egg inside them.

The ICA convenes the triennial International Congresses on Acoustics, sponsors specialty symposia in acoustics, and coordinates the main international meetings within acoustics.  History  The International Commission on Acoustics (ICA) was instituted in 1951 as a subcommittee to the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP). New Statutes were adopted by the International Commission on Acoustics in Antwerp 1996 March 31 and were approved by the IUPAP General Assembly in Uppsala Sweden 1996 September 20. An information letter explaining the proposed changes to the status of the commission was circulated to acoustical societies 1996 May 10. The new ICA held its first General Assembly 1998 June 25 during the 16th Congress in Seattle where the By-laws of the new organization were adopted by the Member Societies. The Commission then became known as the International Commission for Acoustics. The ICA has also applied to become an Affiliated Commission of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (IUTAM). A motion in favor of Affiliation was carried unanimously at the IUTAM General Assembly Meeting held at the University of Stuttgart 1998 August 28‚Äì30. The ICA became a Scientific Associate of the International Council of Scientific Unions ICSU in 2006.

The award can be withheld if candidates do not meet the requirements of excellence but is normally awarded to one or more scientists in the same year. The Award consists of a Certificate with citation, an engraved Medal, and a Cash Prize. The prestige is comparable to that of the Fields Medal for Mathematics. There exist other awards, German Acoustical Society Awards, Institute of Acoustics Society Awards and Acoustical Society of America Awards in acoustics which are usually focussing either on scientists from one country or in one particular field in acoustics or on members of one acoustical organization only and which are normally intended as lifetime achievement awards and/or awards for service to a particular society.

In Cyprus,Data from Fauna Europaea the endemic subspecies Bacillus atticus cyprius is present. Both can often be found climbing on plants and can be kept as a pet in an insectarium.  Description  Adults have a slim body about 80 mm long, with a stripe on each side. Their antennae are red and short. The forelegs are strong, around 50 mm long, painted red at their base.  Behaviour  Bacillus atticus atticus is mostly active at night, when it feeds. The usual foods of this species are plants such as ivy and lettuce. During the day, the animal stays absolutely still, camouflaged as a stick, matching the color of the plant that it's on. If disturbed, its main defense is to feign death. Like many phasmids it is parthenogenetic so it can reproduce on its own by laying eggs. The eggs are ovoid-shaped with some distinguishable glyphics around them and a sponge-like shape on the top.  Living in captivity  They can be kept in cages around 25x25 cm with a simple paper foil at the bottom. They have to be sprayed with clean water at least twice a day and they can be fed with leaves of lettuce and other groceries.Infos at phasmatodea.com  See also  *Bacillus rossius, the endemic Bacillus of Western Mediterranean Europe  References   External links  * Category:Phasmatodea Category:Insects described in 1882 Category:Phasmatodea of Europe Category:Taxa named by Carl Brunner von Wattenwyl ","title":"Bacillus atticus atticus"},{"id":"30543321","text":"King of Rus', King of Ruthenia, King of Galicia and Volhynia, Land of Rus' Lord and Heir (Latin: Rex Rusiae, Rex Galiciae et Lodomeriae, Terrae Russiae Dominus et Heres) was a title of princes of Galicia and Volhynia, granted by the Pope.

It closed on 30 May 2015 to make way for the new GPO: Witness History Interpretive Centre. It was a small museum which offered visitors an insight into the role played by the Post Office in the development of Irish society over many generations. The An Post Museum & Archive continues to hold the Post Office's heritage and philatelic collections, mount occasional temporary displays of its material and publish research on aspects of Irish Post Office history. As well as Irish stamps and philatelic information and a scale model of the GPO, there were several audio visual presentations, An Post's copy of the 1916 Proclamation and a Pepper's ghost dramatisation about the role of the staff who were actually on duty in the GPO on Easter Monday 1916. Much of the information and audio visual material contained in the museum continues to be available on the website. The physical museum will be replaced by a new Interpretive Centre housing a permanent exhibition marking the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, and it will focus on a theme of the GPO as ‚ÄòWitness to History‚Äô. A display within the museum Sections The An Post Museum was divided into three sections: Art of the Stamp, Post Office in Ireland, and Easter 1916. =Art of the Stamp= The Art of the Stamp section offered visitors the opportunity to view Ireland's stamps from the turn of the Free State right up to the present day, by using an interactive stamps database. In this section of the museum there was also a stamp design tool to teach about how stamps are made using digital formats. There were examples of stamp printing plates used to make Ireland's first definitive stamps. =Post Office in Ireland= This section offered visitors the chance to hear the stories of retired post office staff members by the means of a modified switchboard. Visitors could listen to the experiences from different departments within the Irish Post Office when it was known as the Post and Telegraphs (P&T;). There were a number of short visual documentaries detailing the foundation of the Irish Post Office which track its movement from Dublin Castle to its current site O'Connell Street. Visitors could learn how the methods of delivering mails changed with improvements in technology. =Easter 1916= This area displayed a copy of the Proclamation of Ireland that was read aloud by Padraig Pearse from the front the GPO on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916. The design surrounding the Proclamation covered different pictorial views of the damaged GPO after the rebels surrendered to the British Army. There was a holographic (Pepper's ghost) re-enactment of events that took place in the Telegraph Room when the rebels took over the communications room. The film is based on eyewitness accounts taken from the staff members involved. Closure The museum closed on 30 May 2015 though some of its material are available online. This was replaced with a new ‚Ç¨7 million visitor centre GPO Witness History, that opened on 29 March 2016 to commemorate the Easter Rising in 1916 where the General Post Office was a central feature.

Most members of this genus are commonly known as picnic beetles or beer bugs. Description Glischrochilus are oblong shiny black beetles with attractive yellow, red, or orange markings on their elytra. Their elytra are short and expose the upper surface of their last abdominal segments, a good way to distinguish them from the superficially similar but generally larger Megalodacne beetles. They are so similar that some species of Glischrochilus were once classified along with Megalodacne under the now reclassified genus Ips. Like other nitulidid beetles, adult Glischrochilus can be distinguished from other kinds of sap-feeding beetles by their characteristic 11-segmented antennae that end with a 3-segmented ball-like club. Glischrochilus are among the largest of the nitulidid beetles, but they are still generally smaller in comparison to other beetles, averaging at only in length, with larger specimens at long. Glischrochilus eggs are sausage- shaped and milky white. Eggs are laid during spring near decaying plant matter. Larvae are about long and feed for three weeks on fermenting juices and then pupate. It takes a little over a month for picnic beetles to develop from egg to adult and only one generation is produced each year. Ecology European bark beetle predators, Glischrochilus quadripunctatus, are predators of the larvae of wood-boring insects, particularly bark beetles. Glischrochilus beetles from the subgenus Librodor, consisting the majority of species in the genus, feed on exuding sap from injured trees and decaying vegetable or fungal matter. They are also attracted to ripening fruits, as well as beer, vinegar, wine, fruit juice and fermenting beverages. They frequently drown as they feed, rendering these liquids unsuitable for consumption. They congregate in large numbers when such beverages are present, often ruining picnics and outdoor gatherings like barbecues, earning them their common names of 'picnic beetles', 'picnic bugs', or 'beer bugs'. Researchers who wish to attract the bugs use bait that contains beer, molasses, vinegar, pineapple and other ingredients. Glischrochilus beetles from the subgenus Glischrochilus on the other hand are facultative and obligatory predators of soft invertebrates (including insect larvae) living under tree barks. Species from both subgenera are found in North America and Eurasia. Glischrochilus are also known to be involved in the transmission of the plant pathogenic fungi Ceratocystis and Fusarium. They are also considered pests of certain fruit and vegetable crops like strawberries, corn, tomatoes, apricot, muskmelons, raspberries, and peaches. They normally only become a problem when fruits are damaged or are overripe and beginning to ferment. They are difficult to control as they are primarily attracted to the odor of food. Methods of control include scent baits and removing damaged or overripe fruits. Taxonomy Glischrochilus belongs to the subfamily Cryptarchinae under the tribe Cryptarchini. It contains two subgenera, Glischrochilus and Librodor. They were first described by the German entomologist Edmund Reitter in 1873. The name Glischrochilus is derived from the Greek words ' (sticky) and (', lip).

The specific epithet honours British explorer James Cook who visited the Kerguelen Islands in 1776. Description Poa cookii is a deep green, perennial, gynomonoecious grass growing as densely clumped tussocks up to 800 mm in height, with the fibres from older leaf-sheaths forming a tangled mass at the base of the plant. It is a smaller plant than Poa foliosa with which it may grow. The grass flowers from November to February. Distribution and habitat The grass is found on the Prince Edward, Crozet, Heard and Kerguelen Islands of the southern Indian Ocean, as well as on Australia's Macquarie Island. On Heard it occupies moist and sandy areas along the shore and on peat flats with the cushion plant Azorella selago. On Macquarie it grows on rocky areas along the coast up to 200 m above sea level, on flats and slopes on wet peat and along the edges of creeks, often flourishing in the nutrient-rich soil near penguin colonies where it has a competitive advantage over the dominant Poa foliosa. On Macquarie it has been severely affected by rabbit grazing.

Biography Saghar Nizami was born in Aligarh on 21 December 1905. His father, Sardar Ahmed Yar Khan, was a medical doctor in the service of the British government of India. He was a recipient of the Padma Bhushan Award (1969) and the Ghalib Award (1982). Literary career From 1923 to 1932 he edited Paimana, a monthly magazine published by his teacher in Agra. In 1933 he shifted to Meerut and founded Adabi Markaz, a publishing house which, in its very first year of operation, introduced Mehr Lal Soni Zia Fatehabadi to the Urdu literary world by publishing Tullu (Dawn), the latter's first collection of poems. Years later, Yusuf Hussain, Editor of Nairang e Khayal was to class Ahsan Danish, Saghar Nizami and Mehr Lal Soni Zia Fatehabadi as the three bright stars (of Urdu poetry) of the modern era.

During his lifetime he published six collections of ghazals and nazms: Subuhi (1934), Badah e mashriq (1934), Kahkashaan (1934), Rangmahal (1943), Mauj e saahil (1949) and Nehrunama (1967). His collected works, Kuliat e Saghar Nizami, were published in three volumes by Modern Publishing House, Delhi between 1999 and 2001. An appraisal of the works, life and personality of Saghar Nizami titled - Saghar Nizami ‚Äî Fan aur shakhsiyat ma'a kalam written by Zamir Ali Khan was published in 1985; this book also contains his selected ghazals and nazms.

The Bah√° º√≠ Faith arrived in Shanghai in 1862 and Hong Kong in 1870 but not in Macau until 1953.  Beginnings and community growth  In 1953, along with other remaining parts of the globe where no Bah√° º√≠s resided, Macau became a particular goal for expatriate Baha'is to locate. On October 20, 1953, Mrs. Frances Heller, a Bah√° º√≠ from California moved there to reside. By 1954 there were four Bah√° º√≠s in Macau ‚Äì all expatriates ‚Äì but they formed a cohesive group and became designated as a Bah√° º√≠ Group. On July 15, 1954 the first resident of Macau declared his belief in Bah√° ºu'll√°h after studying this system of belief for five months‚ÄîMr. Harry P.F. Yim (Yen Pei-feng or Yim Pui Fung), a small- business proprietor from Canton (Guangzhou), China. In October 1954 the second Macanese, Mr. Paul Kao became a Bah√° º√≠. In that year, Mr. Manuel Ferreira, became the first Portuguese to become a Bah√° º√≠ in Macau. By April 21, 1958 there were enough Baha ºis so that Macau could elect its first Local Spiritual Assembly. In 1960 the first all-Chinese Local Spiritual Assembly was elected.Sims, Barbara R. (1991) ‚ÄúThe Macau Bah√° º√≠ Community in the Early Years‚Äù, http://bahai-library.com/east-asia/macau/ In the 1970s more pioneers arrived to continue to lay the foundation of the Bah√° º√≠ community in Macau and to expand its presence to the nearby islands of Taipa and Coloane. By 1973, there were eighteen believers spread out in three localities, the Macau Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane. Later the membership climbed to 32. In March 1974, mainly due to teaching efforts of several pioneers and travel teachers from places such as Malaysia, the Bah√° º√≠ membership climbed to 36 adults with eleven youth. A few months later reports showed 47 adult Bah√° º√≠s and twelve youth in the three areas of Macau. A later statistical report, indicated there were 68 Bah√° º√≠s, including nineteen youth. In the years since the formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of Macau in 1989, the Macau Bah√° º√≠ community continued to expand, and in the 2009 Macau Yearbook their numbers are listed as 2,500, with three Local Spiritual Assemblies.Macau Yearbook 2009. Government Information Bureau of the Macau Special Administrative Region, December 2009 http://yearbook.gcs.gov.mo/  Administration  Administratively, in the early 1950s Macau was under the jurisdiction of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States, but after the National Spiritual Assembly of North East Asia was elected in 1957 they were administered by that body. In April 1974 the National Spiritual Assembly of Hong Kong was elected with Macau included in its jurisdiction. Two residents of Macau were elected to the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of Hong Kong. In 1982 the Local Spiritual Assembly of Macau (peninsular) was granted certification by the government which was equivalent to its recognition as an incorporated charitable body. In 1989 the number of Bah√° º√≠s in Macau was such that, together with its status as a distinct territory, The Universal House of Justice gave permission for Macau to elect its own National Spiritual Assembly. It was the third National Spiritual Assembly in Chinese territory. Taiwan was the first, in 1967, with Hong Kong the second.  Modern community  Despite the agreement to transfer the sovereignty of Macau to the People's Republic of China in 1999 and its designation as a special administrative region (SAR) of China, the position of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Macau - its administration, membership and communities - in the context of local laws has remained unchanged. The \\"National\\" Spiritual Assembly is now referred to as the ‚ÄúSpiritual Assembly‚Äù or ‚ÄúMain Spiritual Assembly‚Äù in Chinese and still retains jurisdiction over the Local Spiritual Assemblies in Macau. The Local Spiritual Assemblies of the Macau Peninsula, Taipa and Coloane are elected respectively once a year. The nine members of each Local Spiritual Assembly are elected from the generality of Bah√° º√≠ residents of the community through secret votes in a form of non-partisan democracy. Electioneering of any sort, candidacy and other tactics common in most political elections is prohibited. The [Main] Spiritual Assembly of Macau is elected in a two-stage process. In the first stage, the entire Bah√° º√≠ population is divided into 19 electoral units, and each unit elects a delegate from the adult Bah√° º√≠s residing within its electoral unit. The 19 delegates elect the nine members of the [Main] Spiritual Assembly at the annual National Convention. Like numerous communities around the world, the Macau Bah√° º√≠ Community is heavily engaged in community-building activities in Macau: ‚Äúmeetings that strengthen the devotional character of the community; classes that nurture the tender hearts and minds of children; groups that channel the surging energies of junior youth; circles of study, open to all, that enable people of varied backgrounds to advance on equal footing and explore the application of the teachings to their individual and collective lives. ‚Äú [ Ref: Universal House of Justice, ‚ÄúTo the Bah√° º√≠s of the World‚Äù Ridvan 2010) Bah√° º√≠s all around the world as well as in Macau have adopted an education and training program which caters to the spiritual needs of its participants and is arranged for different age groups as follows: Ages 5 ‚Äì 7: Children's spiritual education classes Grade 1; Ages 8 ‚Äì 11: Children's spiritual education classes Grade 2; Ages 12 ‚Äì 14: Junior youth spiritual empowerment program; Ages 15 and onwards: A sequence of 8 courses The above systematic sequence of training courses is able to develop in participants a meaningful spiritual life and enable them, in various ways, to serve society. The above programs are usually delivered in the participants' homes in small groups. An individual need not be a Bah√° º√≠ to take these courses. In public articles and briefings the Bah√° º√≠ Faith is recognized as one of the five major religions of the Macau SAR and was included in religious delegations to mainland China.See Chinese Articles: 1. ycwb.com/xkb/2006-09/21/content_1221043.htm 2. www.jxmzj.gov.cn/2006-12/20061218115701.htm  Community relations initiatives  In 1988, the School of the Nations - a Bah√° º√≠-inspired school in Taipa - was established. It is owned by the Badi Foundation. As an international school, it provides an internationally oriented English-medium educational program to meet the needs of both expatriate and local families. Like many other initiatives around the world, both the Badi Foundation and the School of the Nations' efforts are examples of endeavors to translate some of the ideals and concepts of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith into actions that are of benefit to society at large. In recent years, New Millennium Publications, based in Macau, was established and makes more and more literature on the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in Chinese available to Chinese readers. =Relations with the People's Republic of China= Since there is no administrative structure for the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in mainland China at present, the Macau Bah√° º√≠ Community, together with the Hong Kong Bah√° º√≠ Community, frequently act as liaison and contact points with the relevant government agencies of the People's Republic of China. The Macau Bah√° º√≠ Community has been involved with exchanges, conferences and events with government, academics, and non-governmental organizations that explore and share the application of the Bah√° º√≠ teachings to the advancement of society.

It is located about 1 km southeast of the ancient city of Ephesos, near the present city of Sel√ßuk in the province of ƒ∞zmir. Between 2007 and 2016 the settlement was systematically investigated. The Tell was first settled in the 7th millennium BC (Neolithic; phases √áuH√∂ XIII‚ÄìVIII), in the period of approx. 6700‚Äì6000 calBC. After a hiatus, the hill was reoccupied in the 2nd half of the 4th millennium BC. (Late Chalcolithic; phases √áuH√∂ VII‚ÄìVb). The end of settlement activity dates to the early Bronze Age (phases √áuH√∂ IV‚ÄìIII) at approx. 2800/2750 calBC. History of research Overview of the excavations in the northern and middle trenches of √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk (Horejs 2017, 13, Fig. 1.2; Photo: N. Gail, √ñAI). The √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk has always been visible as a small elevation in the plain east of B√ºlb√ºldaƒü and was mapped by A. Schindler as early as 1987, as a natural hill without recognizing the archaeological evidence.O. Benndorf: Zur Ortskunde und Stadtgeschichte. In: O. Benndorf (ed.): Forschungen in Ephesos 1. Wien 1906, p. 1‚Äì110. The first archaeological investigations took place in 1995 in the course of rescue excavations under the direction of the Sel√ßuk M√ºzesi.A.

In: M√ºze Kurtarama Kazƒ±larƒ± Semineri (1997) 7. 1998, p. 111‚Äì133. In the following years the hill was increasingly destroyed in the course of intensive agricultural activities, until excavations took place again in 2006. These were planned in 2005 by the excavation director of Ephesos at the time, Friedrich Krinzinger. The first systematic research on the prehistoric archaeology in the region of Ephesos began in 2007, financed by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF Project P 19859-G02).B. Horejs: √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk 1. Anatolian and the Aegean from the 7th to the 3rd Millennium BC. In: Oriental and European Archaeology 5. Vienna 2017. These first campaigns were led by Barbara Horejs and funded until 2010. The resulting ground breaking results and the great scientific potential of the hill led to further projects, again funded by the FWF (FWF START Project Y 528-G02 and P 25825) and the European Research Council (ERC Prehistoric Anatolia 26339), also under the direction of Barbara Horejs. After completion of the project in 2016, the results will be prepared for publication in a separate \\"√áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk\\" series as part of the Oriental and European Archaeology (OREA) publications. Settlement and surroundings The reconstruction of the prehistoric landscape, the original coastline, the existing ecological resources and finally, the climatic conditions and their changes over the millennia, are central questions in the exploration of the tell in its micro-regional environment. Against this background, it becomes clear that the history of settlement can only be understood with the involvement of interdisciplinary research disciplines. The team is therefore made up of specialists in archaeology, archaeometallurgy, archaeozoology, archaeobotany, anthropology, climatology and physics as well as paleogeography and geology/mineralogy. Geographical studiesF. Stock et al.: Neolithic settlement sites in Western Turkey ‚Äì palaeogeographic studies at √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk and Arvalya H√∂y√ºk. In: Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports 4. 2015, p. 565‚Äì577. show that the √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk was originally located on a marine lagoon. Whilst it is unclear whether mobile hunters and gatherers used this lagoon as a habitat, it is assumed that the first settlers came over the sea.B. Horejs et al.: The Aegean in the early 7th millennium BC. Maritime networks and colonization. In: Journal of World PRehistory 28, 4, 2015, p. 289‚Äì330. These people brought along a whole package of maritime know-how, which is suggested by the evidence of specialised fishing and the knowledge of navigation along certain sea routes. Even if the means of transport have not been preserved, the use of simple boats is probable. The valley basin, densely overgrown with oaks, was crossed by small streams and formed the perfect habitat for early farmers and cattle breeders. Excavations and results Plan of the areas excavated between 2006 and 2014 on √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk (Horejs 2017, 16, Fig. 1.4; map: M. B√∂rner; DEM: Th. Urban). The site was excavated in three areas. In the north (trenches N 1-6), in the middle area (trench M1) and in the southern trenches (S1-4), trenches S1-4 revealed the original centre of the Tell. These excavations showed that the hill, clearly visible in the landscape, is a prehistoric Tell (Turk. H√∂y√ºk). The hill was created due to thousands of years of settlement and rebuilding in the same place, resulting in the accumulation of massive occupation layers overlying each other, forming an artificial hill. This form of settlement is typical in the periods of the Neolithic, the Chalcolithic and the Bronze Age (8.‚Äì2. Millennium B.C.) from the Orient to Southeast Europe. However, in Western Anatolia only a few tells have been excavated and systematically explored to date. At √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk, a total of thirteen superimposed settlements from different periods have been identified. Each of these settlement phases (√áuH√∂ I‚ÄìXIII) was relatively dated on the basis of material studies (mainly ceramics) but also using absolute chronology from over 100 radiocarbon dates. = Neolithic = The oldest settlement phase at √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk (phase √áuH√∂ XIII) derives from the Early Neolithic and dates to the early 7th millennium BC, based on short-lived radiocarbon data.B. Miliƒá, B. Horejs: The Onset of Pressure Blade making in Western Anatolia in the 7th Millennium BC. A Case Study from Neolithic √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk. In: Horejs 2017. p. 27‚Äì52. The findings, which were excavated at the foot of today's hill, show remnants of everyday life, such as stone working. The early detection of pressure technology, for chopped stone tools, and specific types of tools, indicate new influences from outside.Horejs et al. 2015 Together with other indicators, this technology reflects a link to the Northern Levant (PPNB), from which a maritime network can already be derived in this early phase of the Neolithic in Western Anatolia. Horejs argues that pioneers, embedded in this network, were looking for new land on the Aegean coast and were the first settlers in this region.Horejs et al. 2015 Some 150 years later, in the late Neolithic, the settlers of √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk built houses with solid stone bases, wooden posts and mud walls. Many activities can be reconstructed based on the findings, these include weapons, such as sling missiles made of stone and clay, which were stored within the settlement. A particularly extraordinary find is a cache of long and sharp obsidian blades, found inside of a building. They are not only unique in the Aegean, but also show the far-reaching relationships of the inhabitants. The raw material comes from the island of Melos in the Aegean Sea, some 300 km away. The technology of long blade production and the ritual practice of their deposition are particularly well known in the Middle East. In addition, analysis has also shown that local potters produced very high quality, thin- walled containers, which were probably mainly used for storing and consuming food. Very often fish were on the menu, as the remains of a tuna fillet on a floor prove. Even in this early period, diet was varied, based mainly on domestic animals such as pigs, sheep, goats and cattle. This food was supplemented by wild hare, fox, red deer and aurochs as well as the collection of sea shells. The maritime character of this society is indicated by deep-sea fish, recovered for the first time, which suggests a sea voyage across the borders of the Aegean. Beside contacts with the Aegean, proven by the use of Melian Obsidian, contact with East Anatolia, Mesopotamia and the Near East also existed. A specialization in craftsmanship of the people settling here can be seen, among other things, in the high-quality ceramic vessels and the chopped stone tools, which were predominantly made from imported obsidian.M. Bergner et al.: Zur Herkunft der OBsidianartefakte vom √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk. In: Studia Troica 18. 2009, p. 251‚Äì273. This early settlement was abandoned, however, the reasons for which are not clear. = Late Chalcolithic = After a hiatus of about 2600 years, the settlement hill was only reoccupied in the late Chalcolithic period, in the 2nd half of the 4th millennium BC. This \\"recolonisation\\" includes the phases √áuH√∂ VII‚ÄìVb, which were excavated in the trenches N7 and M1. In the oldest phase of this period the settlement was surrounded by a huge moat, most likely related to fortification. After a short time, however, it was infilled with stones, probably to provide an area for settlement expansion, suggested by the subsequent construction of new structures.

Vienna 2018. = Early Bronze Age = The Early Bronze Age is an era of great and lasting changes in the Aegean and South Eastern Europe. Probably triggered by the demand for metals and their trade, as well as the resulting wealth, the first proto-urban centres and large fortified settlements emerged around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC.B. Horejs: Proto-Urbanisation without urban centres? A model of transformation for the ƒ∞zmir region in the 4th millennium BC. In: B. Horejs, M. Mehofer (eds.): Western Anatolia Before Troy. Proto-Urbanisation in 4th Millennium BC. Proceedings of the International Symposium held at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Vienna, Austria, 21‚Äì24 November 2012, Oriental and European Archaeology 1. Vienna 2014, p. 15‚Äì41. The role of Western Anatolia in this important development phase of human societies is still unclear in many areas. From about 3000 BC, with the beginning of the Bronze Age, the hill of √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk is now densely covered with architecture. Multi-room buildings, open places and alleys testify to the intensive use of the area. About 50 furnaces and a multitude of metallurgical finds prove a metallurgical centre was established at the site. Of particular importance is the production of copper objects whose manufacture can be verified from casting in a prefabricated mould to forging.Mehofer 2016 The analytical studies of metals, slags, semi-finished and finished products, and related tools, show a highly specialized community between 2950/2900 and 2750 calBC. The main focus of these craftspeople was the production of arsenic copper. This was extended to also include a few precious metals (gold, silver), silver-copper alloys and very rarely tin-bronze production. Ceramic finds, such as jugs and storage vessels, but also antler objects, and the metal finds, give an insight into the everyday life of specialized craftspeople. In addition to objects used for the communities own requirements, products for trade were also manufactured in the workshops. There is also evidence for ovens and stoves which were used for cooking. Further handicraft activities, such as the processing of bones or leather, also took place within the rooms, and we find that textile production was another important economic activity, suggested by the numerous spindle whorls and loom weights, found in the settlement. Analyses of textile production show a specialization also in this craft sector. The settlement of the Early Bronze Age can be regarded as a place with multi-layered activities. It is primarily a metallurgical centre for the production of copper and bronze objects. In addition to these specialists, the residents included textile craftspeople, fishermen and small farmers. Due to the intensive character of specialized craft activities livestock farming was probably undertaken by other groups outside the centre. This specialization and division of labour suggest early proto-urban structures about 5000 years ago. Another important role within the Bronze Age settlement, beside hunting and agriculture, was marine fishing. The preparation of mussels was also very popular at this time as demonstrated by the presence of pits filled with mussel shells. The eating habits of the inhabitants seem to have been quite different to those of earlier periods. During the EBA sheep and goat are dominant in the assemblage, followed by cattle. Beside fallow deer and wild boar, aurochs and possibly wisent were hunted. When it comes to marine sources, lagoon cockles are dominant. In fish, a high diversity including dolphins can be seen. No fresh water species, except eel, were fished throughout EBA. Probable off shore fishing is indicated by sharks and rays, although the major fishing was conducted close to the shore.A. Galik, In: B. Horejs: Aktivit√§ten und Subsistenz in den Siedlungen des √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk. Der Forschungsstand nach den Ausgrabungen 2006‚Äì2007. In: Pr√§historische Zeitschrift. 86, 2011, p. 31‚Äì66.  Significance  The excavations at √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk revealed the oldest settlement of Ephesos, which began about 9000 years ago, but also one of probably the oldest settlement sites in Western Anatolia. Central questions on the spread of the Neolithic from Inner Anatolia to Southeast Europe are only one aspect of the Tell's research. The function of the hill in the 4th millennium BC and the cultural developments that took place in this period (which finally led to the new period of the Bronze Age) form an additional broad field of research with many unanswered questions. Finally, √áukuri√ßi H√∂y√ºk with its well-preserved remains of Early Bronze Age settlements also offers potential for a better understanding of the lasting cultural changes in the early 3rd millennium BC. Its location at an intersection between the cultural regions of Anatolia and the Aegean also allows research into large-scale contacts and relationships, without which many developments in the prehistory of mankind would be inconceivable.

Directed by Robert Wiene, it premiered on 10 January 1926 at the Dresden Semperoper, which had also hosted the actual opera's premiere 15 years earlier. Hofmannsthal considerably changed the storyline for the film version (which included a final scene in the formal gardens behind the Field Marshal's residence) and Strauss' score included music not only from the opera but also sections of his Couperin Suite and a march for the Field Marshal, who appears in this version. The music during the film's performances was provided by an orchestra. At the premiere, this was conducted by Richard Strauss himself. The film's projection speed had to be adjusted by the projector in order to fit the speed of the orchestra. This task fell to the film's cameraman, Hans Androschin, because only he knew the exact length of each scene and cut. In later performances, a special recording, also conducted by Strauss, provided the music. Strauss conducted the Vienna and London premieres (and recorded excerpts from the film score on the Victrola label at that time. A planned tour of the United States in 1927 by Strauss and his orchestra failed to go ahead because of the emergence of sound films. The American premiere took place at Yale University's Woolsey Hall with the Yale Symphony Orchestra conducted by John Mauceri (who received special permission from Strauss' son) on 29 March 1974. A copy of the film was found in the Czech National Archive and Mauceri translated the titles with Glenn Most into English. The final sequence was missing from the print and was performed with orchestral music and titles alone. The score and parts were held by the Library of Congress.

These pillow shaped tanks are designed for large volume liquid transport, industrial chemicals, potable water, sludge, and fuel storage. Standard fuel bladder tanks sizes range from to capacities and larger and custom fuel storage bladders and cells are available, although at sizes exceeding there is an increased spill risk. To minimize the risk of leakage, and for the sake of containing a catastrophic spill, all fuel bladders should be housed in secondary containment (bunding). The use of fuel bladders without precautionary measures is risky and should not be undertaken. The fines involved with fuel spills are well known and the EPA has set clear guidelines for the use of secondary containment concerning fuel bladders.  Primary use  Fuel bladders are used in various fields, such as agribusiness, public works, humanitarian, military and industrial areas. Standard tanks are designed for land based use and operations, but can be used in marine settings and in aviation given proper support. Fuel bladders are also commonly used in oil spill recovery operations. High end fuel bladders offer a high degree of protection of the stored liquids, ensuring the contents never come in contact with air. This ensures that there is no risk of evaporation or explosion due to gas formation. In order to prevent liquid contamination, a neutral barrier film is added to the fuel bladder's inner side. Fuel bladders are most useful in situations where critical infrastructure has been compromised or does not exist. Benefits of using a flexible storage system like fuel bladders is their ability to be transported and set up quickly. GMA Cover Corp. advertises that their pillow shaped bladders are foldable at less than 5% of the total volume. Other unique characteristics of fuel bladders are their high resistance to climatic conditions, which makes them useful for use in disaster zones and wartime desert operations.

Fuel bladders can come equipped with all the necessary components for transportation, for example water transportation or fuel transportation on vehicles. Flexible tanks are equipped with adjustable skirts and adjustable towage straps designed to provide high resistance to transport constraints. Adjustable skirts may be replaced by a strap net in case the users need to transform a traditional storage tank to a transportable flexible tank. Specially developed flexible fuel bladders can also be towed by sled, as in the unique Antarctic expeditions made by American, German and British science teams.  Additional uses  Flexible pillow tanks are also used as 'water bladders'. The synthetic fabrics used are tough and strong to avoid damage and to prevent leakage.

The present building with two major auditoria was designed by the architect and built between 1965 and 1969. It opened in 1970.  History  The theatre dates back to 1747 when during the reign of elector Karl Theodor the Gie√ühaus was transformed to a theatre. In 1818 Friedrich Wilhelm II donated this building to the city of D√ºsseldorf. Josef Derossi was its first director, succeeded in 1834 by the poet Karl Leberecht Immermann. In 1905 a house dedicated to plays was opened by Louise Dumont and Gustav Lindemann who brought the house to fame. After World War II Wolfgang Langhoff was the first director, succeeded in 1946 by Gustaf Gr√ºndgens. His directions made the house one of the most important stages in Europe. In 1955 he was succeeded by Karl Heinz Stroux. = Present building = The present theatre was commissioned by the city of D√ºsseldorf during the tenure of Stroux. The Operettenhaus, which had served as a venue for performance of plays after World War II, proved too limited. In 1957 a new building was proposed, for which the site, on Gustaf-Gr√ºndgens-Platz, was secured in 1958. An international competition was held in 1959 and won by Pfau. The theatre is designed like a sculpture, juxtaposed to the nearby Dreischeibenhaus. The style has been described as organic architecture. The great hall (Gro√ües Haus) seated 900 people then (now 760), the small hall (Kleines Haus) 300. Construction took place from 1965 to 1969, and the theatre opened on 16 January 1970 with a performance of Georg B√ºchner's Dantons Tod. In 1972 Ulrich Brecht succeeded Stroux as director, followed in 1974 by G√ºnter Beelitz, then Volker Canaris. In 1996 Anna Badora was director, succeeded in 2006 by Am√©lie Niermeyer. Staffan Valdemar Holm was director from 2011, with four venues, Gro√ües Haus, Kleines Haus, Junges Schauspielhaus (Young play house) and Central.

Similarly, it was used by the trading Saraswat and Daivajna families along with the Modi script to maintain their accounts. Overview Goykanadi was used in Goa since the times of the Kadambas, although it lost its popularity after the 17th century. Goykanadi is very different from the Old Kannada script, with strikingly similar features. Unlike Old Kannada, Kandevi/Goykanadi letters were usually written with a distinctive horizontal bar, like the Nagari scripts. This script may have been evolved out of the Kadamba script, which was extensively used in Goa and Konkan. Usage and extinction The inquisition of Goa is seen as a blot in the history of the Konkani language. According to the orders of the Goa inquisition it was an offence to remain in possession of books in the local languages. All books, whatever their subject matter, written in Konkani, Marathi and Sanskrit were seized by the inquisition and burnt on the suspicion that they might deal with idolatry. It is probable that valuable non-religious literature dealing with art, literature, sciences, etc., were destroyed indiscriminately as a consequence. For instance, even before the inquisition orders in a letter dated 24 November 1548, D Fr Joao de Albuquerque proudly reports his achievement in this direction. Many Konkani manuscripts which are now found in museums in Portugal are Roman transliterations of Kandavi manuscripts of Hindu epics. The earliest document written in this script is found in a petition addressed by Ravala ≈öe·π≠ƒ´, a Gaunkar of Caraim in the islands of Goa, to the king of Portugal.

The Lufthansa-operated Airbus A310-300 was hijacked by Nebiu Demeke, an Ethiopian man seeking asylum who forced the pilot to fly to New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The aircraft landed safely, and the gunman surrendered peacefully and without incident. He was charged with air piracy by a United States district court, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Flight  Flight 592 was an international flight operated by Deutsche Lufthansa AG between Frankfurt International Airport, Frankfurt, Germany, and Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with a scheduled intermediate stop at Cairo International Airport, Cairo, Egypt. The aircraft was an Airbus A310-300, registration D-AIDM, that had been in service since August 30, 1991. The flight carried 94 passengers and 10 crew.  Hijacker  Nebiu Zewolde Demeke was born on September 24, 1972 in Egypt. His father, an economist, was a political prisoner in Ethiopia, and the Demeke family moved to Morocco after his arrest to escape persecution. Nebiu Demeke studied at the American School in Tangiers, Morocco, where he was described as \\"distracted\\" and \\"emotional.\\" His older sister, Selamawit, went to study at Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. His older brother, Demter, enrolled at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, and his younger brother, Brook, lived in Indiana. Though Demeke attempted to join his siblings in the United States, he was denied a student visa, and was unable to otherwise receive permission to legally enter the country. Six months prior to the hijacking, 20-year-old Demeke moved to Germany and applied for political asylum. When he withdrew his application for asylum, the German government purchased him a ticket on Flight 592 back to Ethiopia. Demeke entered the airport carrying a starting pistol loaded with blanks. Prior to reaching security, he placed the pistol on his head and covered it with an \\"Indiana Jones\\"-style fedora. When it came time to pass through the metal-detector, he pinched the top of the hat and placed both it and the hidden pistol on a table. He retrieved both prior to boarding the plane.  Hijacking  At Frankfurt Airport, Nebiu Demeke took advantage of the airport security by stuffing a pistol deep into his hat and then placing his hat on a table adjacent to the scanner. The security guards were not as strict as now since the incident took place before 9/11 and they allowed Demeke to pass. Approximately 35 minutes into the flight, as the aircraft reached cruising altitude in Austrian airspace, Demeke entered the forward lavatory. He put on a black ski mask and removed his pistol. Leaving the lavatory, he entered the cockpit, which was unlocked. Placing the pistol to the pilot's head, he said, \\"If you do not turn west, I'll shoot you.\\" Demeke demanded that the aircraft be flown to New York City and demanded political asylum in the United States. After being told that the plane would need to be refueled, Demeke agreed to allow a refueling stop in Hannover, Germany. The aircraft landed at Hannover- Langenhagen Airport around noon local time, where it was surrounded by law enforcement officials. Demeke remained in the cockpit with the pistol to the pilot's head, and threatened to begin killing a flight attendant every five minutes. German authorities allowed the plane to depart after Demeke threatened to kill his hostages but promised to surrender peacefully upon reaching the United States. Pilot Gerhard Goebel was able to calm Demeke down during the non-stop flight to New York. Though Demeke kept the pistol pointed at Goebel's head for the duration of the flight, he removed his ski mask. Goebel later told newspapers that he spent the hours trying to build a rapport with Demeke, who admitted to having spent several months planning the hijacking. Both men agreed that, upon arriving in New York, Goebel would give Demeke his sunglasses in exchange for Demeke's pistol. The aircraft arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport at around 4:00 pm EDT and taxied to a remote part of the runway. A three-man hostage negotiation team had been assembled in the air traffic control tower. NYPD detective Dominick Misino spoke with Demeke over the radio, assisted by FBI special agent John Flood and Port Authority detective sergeant Carmine Spano. After 70 minutes of negotiation, Demeke traded his pistol for the pilot's sunglasses and surrendered peacefully to authorities. All 94 passengers and ten crew were unharmed.  Aftermath  Nebiu Demeke was arrested and charged with air piracy in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. He was arraigned on February 12, 1993; Judge Allyne Ross ordered him held without bail until his trial. Demeke remained convinced that he would not spend any time in prison and that he would be granted asylum. During the course of his trial, he was twice found to be incompetent to stand trial and was prescribed medication for depression and hallucinations. He represented himself during the course of his four-day trial. He was found guilty in a jury trial after an hour of deliberation, and Judge Sterling Johnson, Jr. sentenced him to prison until 2013. Germany was criticized severely by the international press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol on board, and for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures. The incident was the first trans-Atlantic hijacking since five Croatian nationalists hijacked TWA Flight 355 on September 10, 1976. In that incident, the domestic New York-Chicago flight was forced to fly to Paris, France. In 2012, the hijacking was mentioned on an episode of the TV show Hostage: Do or Die on the episode \\"The Last Transatlantic Hijacking\\".

The Finnair Sud Aviation Caravelle with 44 passengers and 5 crew aboard was hijacked by an unemployed home building contractor. After forcing the pilot to fly to Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Helsinki, the hijacker received his ransom demands and released his hostages. He was arrested at his home the following day.  Hijacking  Flight 405 was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight operated by Finnair between Oulu Airport and Helsinki Airport. On September 30, 1978, the flight was serviced by a Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle. Aarno Lamminparras, a 37-year-old unemployed home building contractor who had recently declared bankruptcy, boarded the aircraft in Oulu. Since Finnish airports did not perform security checks on domestic flights, he was able to carry a loaded Walther 7.65mm pistol aboard. At approximately 16:00, while en route to Helsinki, Lamminparras entered the cockpit and held the pilot at gunpoint. The aircraft continued to Helsinki, where 34 of the passengers were released. Lamminparras subsequently forced the pilot to fly back to Oulu where the aircraft circled the airport for several hours before landing to refuel. A US$ 168,000 ransom payment from Finnair was also loaded onto the plane. The plane was then flown back to Helsinki, where Lamminparras demanded $38,000 from Helsingin Sanomat, Finland's largest newspaper. The newspaper paid approximately $18,000, and the remaining eleven passengers were freed. The aircraft then flew to Amsterdam, where it landed at Schiphol Airport and refueled. It then returned to Helsinki and received the remainder of the newspaper's ransom payment. The Caravelle then continued on to Oulu. Lamminparras's final demands included four bottles of whiskey, a chauffeured limousine, and 24 hours alone at home with his wife. After police agreed to his demands, Lamminparras released the final three hostages, all of them crewmembers. He agreed to surrender peacefully Monday morning. Oulu police stormed Lamminparras's house and arrested him on Sunday October 1. A police spokesman indicated that law enforcement officers had tapped the hijacker's home phone, and that he had made several phone calls that implied he did not plan to surrender peacefully as he had initially agreed. He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment in 1979.

In 1719 it was declared a free port by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor; the construction of the Austrian Southern Railway (1841‚Äì57) turned it into a bustling seaport, through which much of the exports and imports of the Austrian Lands were channelled. Trieste was part of the Holy Roman Empire and, later, of the German Confederation and the Austrian Littoral. The city administration and economy were dominated by the city's Italian population element; Italian was the language of administration and jurisdiction. In the later 19th and early 20th century, the city attracted the immigration of workers from the city's hinterlands, many of whom were speakers of Slovene.  History  = Background = After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476, Trieste was a Byzantine military outpost. In 567 AD the city was destroyed by the Lombards, in the course of their invasion of northern Italy. In 788 it became part of the Frankish kingdom, under the authority of their count-bishop. From 1081 the city came loosely under the Patriarchate of Aquileia, developing into a free commune by the end of the 12th century. After two centuries of war, Trieste came with the signing of a peace treaty on 30 October 1370 in front of St. Bartholomew's Church in the village of ≈†i≈°ka (') (now part of Ljubljana) under the Republic of Venice. The Venetians retained the town until 1378, when it became the property of the Patriarchate of Aquileia.Anka Benedetiƒç. \\"Iz zgodovine ≈†i≈°ke.\\" Javna tribuna. Discontent with the patriarch's rule, the main citizens of Trieste in 1382 petitioned Leopold III of Habsburg, Duke of Austria to become part of his domains, in exchange for his defence. This united Charlemagne's southern marches under Habsburg rule, subsequently consolidated as the Austrian Littoral (). thumb = Trieste in the Holy Roman Empire = Following an unsuccessful Habsburg invasion of Venice in the prelude to the War of the League of Cambrai, the Venetians occupied Trieste again in 1508, and under the terms of the peace were allowed to keep the city. The Habsburg Empire recovered Trieste a little over a year later, however, when conflict resumed. With their acquisition by the Habsburgs, Carniola and the Julian March ceased to act as an east-facing outpost of Italy against the unsettled peoples of the Danube basin, becoming a region of contact between the land-based Austrian domains and the maritime republic of Venice, whose foreign policy depended on control of the Adriatic. Austro-Venetian rivalry over the Adriatic weakened each state's efforts to repel the Ottoman Empire's expansion into the Balkans (which caused many Slavs to flee into the ', sowing the seeds of future Yugoslav union), and paving the way for the success of Napoleon's invasion. On the Habsburg's annexation, Trieste had a patriciate, a bishop and his chapter, two municipal chapters totalling 200 people, armed forces and institutions of higher education. Italian irredentism was continually popular ‚Äî writing in 1917, the Italian nationalist Litta Visconti Arese described the city as: Trieste became an important port and trade hub. In June 1717, it was made a free port within the Habsburg Empire by Emperor Charles VI (r. 1711‚Äì40), effective from his visit to the city on 10 September 1718, and remained a free port until 1 July 1891, when it was eclipsed by Fiume (now Rijeka). From June 1734, Charles VI began assembling a navy in the city. The reign of Charles VI's successor, Maria Theresa (r. 1740‚Äì65), marked the beginning of a flourishing era for the city, starting with her order for the dismantling of the city walls in 1749, in order to allow the freer expansion of the city, and ordering expansive building works and canal dredging. In 1768, the German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann was murdered by a robber in Trieste, while on his way from Vienna to Italy. = French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars = Map of Italy in 1810, with the alt=Map of Italy in 1810, showing the French Empire covering most of the western upper quarter of the peninsula, with the Illyrian Provinces, including Trieste and Dalmatia, also a French dependency, separated from the Empire-proper by the Kingdom of Italy. Trieste was occupied by French troops three times during the Napoleonic Wars, in 1797, 1805 and in 1809. Between 1809 and 1813, it was annexed to the Illyrian Provinces, interrupting its status as a free port and causing a loss of the city's autonomy; the municipal autonomy was not restored after the return of the city to the Austrian Empire in 1813. For the French, the Illyrian Provinces provided a military frontier against the remaining Austrian lands and a military base against the Turks, as well as providing distant endowments for Marshals of the Empire. When Napoleon defeated the Republic of Venice in 1797, he found that Istria was populated by Italians on the coast and in the main cities, but the interior was populated mainly by Croats and Slovenians; this dual ethnicity in the same peninsula created antagonism between Slavs and Italians for the supremacy of Istria, when nationalism first started to rise after Napoleon's fall. The restoration of Istria to the Austrian Empire was confirmed at the Congress of Vienna, but a nationalistic feud began to develop between the Slavs and the Italians. = Trieste in the Austrian Empire and Austria‚ÄìHungary = alt=The northeast coast of the Adriatic, with the Austrian Kingdom of Illyria highlighted among the other Austrian territories (the Kingdom of Lombardy‚ÄìVenetia, the County of Tirol, the Duchy of Salzburg, the Duchy of Styria, the Kingdom of Croatia and the Croatian Military Frontier) Following the Napoleonic Wars, Trieste continued to prosper as the free imperial city of Trieste (), a status that granted economic freedom, but limited its political self-government. The city's role as main Austrian trading port and shipbuilding centre was later emphasised with the foundation of the merchant shipping line Austrian Lloyd in 1836, whose headquarters stood at the corner of the Piazza Grande and Sanit√†. By 1913, Austrian Lloyd had a fleet of 62 ships comprising a total of With the introduction of the constitutionalism in the Austrian Empire in 1860, the municipal autonomy of the city was restored, with Trieste becoming capital of the ', the Austrian Littoral region. In the later part of the 19th century, Pope Leo XIII considered moving his residence to Trieste (or to Salzburg), due to what he considered a hostile anti-Catholic climate in Italy, following the capture of Rome by the newly founded Kingdom of Italy. However, the Austrian monarch Franz Josef I gently rejected this idea. The modern Austro-Hungarian Navy used Trieste's shipbuilding facilities for construction and as a base. The Austrian acquisition of Lombardy-Veneto (1815‚Äì66) meant that Trieste was no longer in a frontier zone, encouraging the construction of the first major trunk railway in the Empire, the Vienna‚ÄìTrieste Austrian Southern Railway (), was completed in 1857, a valuable asset for trade and the supply of coal. The importance of Trieste as a trading and shipbuilding city to the Empire is testified by the expenditure made. The construction of cost 29 million crowns over 15 years (1868‚Äì83) and in the following decade another 10 million crowns were spent extending the port (roughly equivalent to 12 tons of gold). Up until 1914, over 14 million crowns of subsidies were paid to Austrian shipping companies using Trieste. This investment and railway-building resulted in a rapid expansion of Triestine trade, which peaked in 1913 at over 6 million tons of goods, with the port almost entirely reliant on Austro-Hungarian trade, as opposed to transshipment; even after the Italian acquisition of the city, Trieste continued to be a port for central and southeastern Europe, rather than Italian trade, mainly for coffee, sugar and tropical fruits, wines, oils, cotton, iron, wood and machinery. At the beginning of the 20th century, Trieste was a buzzing cosmopolitan city frequented by artists and philosophers such as James Joyce, Italo Svevo, Sigmund Freud, Dragotin Kette, Ivan Cankar, Scipio Slataper, and Umberto Saba. The city was the major port of the Austrian Riviera, and perhaps the only real enclave of ' south of the Alps. Viennese architecture and coffeehouses still dominate the streets of Trieste to this day. = End of Austrian Trieste = Together with Trento, Trieste was a main focus of the irredentist movement, which aimed for the annexation to Italy of all the lands they claimed were inhabited by an Italian-speaking population. Many local Italians enrolled voluntarily in the Royal Italian Army (a notable example is the writer Scipio Slataper). After the end of World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire dissolved, and many of its border areas, including the Austrian Littoral, were disputed among its successor states. On November 3, 1918, the Armistice of Villa Giusti was signed ending hostilities between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Trieste, with Istria and Gorizia was occupied by the Italian Army after the Austro-Hungarian troops had been ordered to lay down their arms, a day before the Armistice was due to enter into effect, effectively allowing the Italians to claim the region had been taken before the cessation of hostilities (a similar situation occurred in South Tyrol). Trieste was lost to Austria at Saint-Germain-en-Laye and officially annexed to the Kingdom of Italy at Rapallo in 1920. If the Liberal governments ruling Italy at time granted Trieste of its ancient autonomy, maintained most of former Austrian laws, and simply gave a new name to the Austrian Littoral as Julian March () without any other legal change, Fascist violence which occurred to Socialists and Christian Democrats in other parts of Italy, were suffered by Slovene organizations in Trieste. The union to Italy brought a loss of importance to the city, as it was now a city on the margin of Italy's map, cut off from its economic hinterland. The Slovene ethnic group (around 25% of the population according to the 1910 census) suffered persecution by rising Italian Fascism. The period of violent persecution of Slovenes began with riots on 13 April 1920, which were organized as a retaliation for the assault on Italian occupying troops in Split by the local Croatian population. Many Slovene-owned shops and buildings were destroyed during the riots, which culminated when a group of Italian Fascists, led by Francesco Giunta, burned down the ' (\\"\\"), the community hall of Trieste's Slovenes. The end of Trieste autonomy was a consequence of the March on Rome in 1922. Immediately after their rose to power, the Fascists abolished the Austrian administrative structure of the Julian March, which was divided between the new-formed Province of Trieste, of which Trieste became a simple municipality, and the Province of Pola, the remaining part of the territory being annexed by the Province of Udine.Royal decree n¬∞53 of January 18, 1923, by King Victor Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Benito Mussolini.  Demographics  The particular Friulian dialect, called ', spoken until the beginning of the 19th century, was gradually overcome by the Triestine dialect (with a Venetian base, deriving directly from vulgar Latin) and other languages, including German grammar, Slovene and standard Italian languages. While Triestine was spoken by the largest part of the population, German was the language of the Austrian bureaucracy and Slovene was predominant in the surrounding villages. From the last decades of the 19th century, Slovene language speakers grew steadily, reaching 25% of the overall population of the municipality of Trieste in 1911 (30% of the Austro-Hungarian citizens in Trieste). According to the 1911 census, the proportion of Slovene speakers amounted to 12.6% in the city centre, 47.6% in the suburbs, and 90.5% in the surroundings. They were the largest ethnic group in 9 of the 19 urban neighborhoods of Trieste, and represented an absolute majority in 7 of them. The Italian speakers, on the other hand, were 60.1% of the population in the city centre, 38.1% in the suburbs, and 6.0% in the surroundings. They were the largest linguistic group in 10 of the 19 urban neighborhoods and represented the majority in 7 of them (including all 6 in the city centre). Of the 11 villages included within the city limits, the Slovene speakers had an overwhelming majority in 10, and the German speakers in one (Miramare). German speakers amounted to 5% of the city's population, with the highest proportions in the city centre. A small number of the population spoke Serbo-Croatian (around 1.3% in 1911), and the city also counted several other smaller ethnic communities: Czechs, Istro- Romanians, Serbs and Greeks, which mostly assimilated either to the Italian or Slovene-speaking community.

In January 2016 it was announced that Sony was acquiring Altair for $212 Million.Sony to buy Israeli co Altair Semiconductor for $200m Corporate History Altair was founded in May 2005 by former Texas Instruments executives Oded Melamed, Yigal Bitran, and Eran Eshed, with extensive broadband and wireless silicon experience. Altair's management and technology executives were among the founding team of Libit Signal Processing, a fabless chip company acquired by Texas Instruments in 1999 for $365 million. Altair is privately held, and has raised in excess of $120M financing to date. The company has a long history of developing 4G semiconductor solutions and prior to strategically shifting full focus to 3GPP LTE in 2006, had developed solutions for WiMAX and Japanese XGP standards. In January 2016 it was announced that Sony was acquiring Altair for $212 Million. Market LTE has emerged as the de facto 4G (4th Generation) technology, after having won the battle over rival technology WiMAX, which failed to gain global carrier acceptance and critical deployment mass. As data usage minutes are on a steep increase vector, and voice ARPU (Average revenue per user) remain flat, carriers face a need to offer advanced and cost effective mobile broadband services which will offset the profitability decline and increase customer satisfaction. According to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), 338 telecoms operators in 101 countries have committed to commercial LTE network deployments or are engaged in trials, technology testing or studies. LTE networks are already fully deployed in key markets such as the U.S. and South Korea. Analysts forecast the number of LTE subscribers worldwide to reach 1B subscribers by 2016. In addition to connecting the consumer device market, LTE has the potential to push forward the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT). As of 2013, the internet had about 10-15 billion devices connected to it. Industry experts predict some 25 billion devices will be connected by 2015, and 50 billion by 2020. Many of these connections, whether consumer, enterprise, industrial, or other will require Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) connections, and given the connectivity requirements, a majority of these connection could be via LTE networks.

It extends in a southwest to northeast direction, from a junction with U.S. Route 6 (US 6) in Clear Creek Canyon between Golden and Idaho Springs to a junction with Interstate 25 (I-25) east of Longmont. The southwest portion of the road is a scenic mountain drive providing dramatic vistas of the Front Range, while the northeast portion is a busy interurban thoroughfare. The city of Boulder separates these two vastly different sections of SH 119. Route description SH 119 approaching the southern terminus Highway 119 begins at a signalized T intersection with U.S. Highway 6 in Clear Creek Canyon between Golden and Idaho Springs. It then heads north, alongside North Clear Creek, to the gambling town of Blackhawk; this section of the road carries heavy traffic to the casinos of Blackhawk and Central City and experiences many accidents. Front Range mountains as seen from northbound State Highway 119, between Blackhawk and Rollinsville It continues north from Blackhawk as the Peak to Peak Scenic and Historic Byway, skirting the western edge of Golden Gate Canyon State Park where it intersects State Highway 46. It continues north through the village of Mid Gilpin to Rollinsville, where it crosses over South Boulder Creek and the tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad, on its way from Denver to the Moffat Tunnel. East Portal Road in Rollinsville provides access to the east portal of the railroad tunnel, and to the Moffat Road historic railroad grade across Rollins Pass. SH 119 continues northward, intersecting State Highway 72 with which it will be concurrent to Nederland. It provides access to the Eldora Mountain Resort ski area, about west of Nederland. In Nederland, SH 119 and SH 72 diverge at a roundabout intersection where SH 72 takes the Peak to Peak Highway designation with it to the north, and Route 119 turns to the east. Leaving Nederland, SH 119 passes along the northern shore of Barker Meadow Reservoir and enters the scenic Boulder Canyon, alongside Boulder Creek. In the canyon, the road experiences grades of up to 10%, which can be dangerous for heavy trucks heading downhill, as it does not have a runaway truck ramp. The walls of the canyon are popular for rock climbing, and the scenic Boulder Falls is an easy walk from the highway. SH 119 at junction with SH 52 At the mouth of the canyon, SH 119 suddenly enters Boulder as Canyon Boulevard, intersecting State Highway 93 at Broadway, and turning north on 28th Street where it begins concurrency with U.S. Highway 36 and with unsigned State Highway 7. This busy section of State 119 and US 36 on 28th Street serves Boulder's main shopping area. The overlap with US 36 ends at the northern edge of Boulder where US 36 continues north to Rocky Mountain National Park, and SH 119 turns east becoming Diagonal Highway. At an intersection with State Highway 157, SH 119 bends northeast, paralleling the tracks of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, and becomes an expressway with a very wide median, possibly intended to accommodate a future freeway. At Niwot it passes a very large facility for the IBM Corporation at an intersection with State Highway 52. The Diagonal Highway expressway ends in Longmont, as SH 119 becomes Ken Pratt Blvd. and intersects U.S. Highway 287. East of US 287 in Longmont, a new expressway carries SH 119 directly to its northeastern terminus at a diamond interchange at Interstate 25 exit 240. History SH 119 was established in the 1920s, extending from Idaho Springs to Boulder. It went up Virginia Canyon on the aptly named Oh My God Road, and then through Central City to Blackhawk. This section from Idaho Springs to Blackhawk was changed to the present, easier alignment in 1938, with the southern terminus no longer in Idaho Springs but instead at a road junction with US 6 several miles to the east in Clear Creek Canyon. In 1998, the somewhat confusing triangle intersection with US 6 was simplified to a T intersection controlled by a traffic signal, and the west side of the triangle was abandoned and its tunnel boarded up. SH 119 approaching its northern terminus In 1939 SH 119 was extended from Boulder to Longmont, zig-zagging along existing county roads. By 1960 it had been completely paved and straightened on a diagonal route (hence the name \\"Diagonal Highway\\") alongside the railroad tracks between Boulder and Longmont. When Interstate 25 was built east of Longmont by 1963, SH 119 was extended by overlapping US 287 to Third Avenue, where it replaced the previous SH 254 to connect to I-25. In 2003, a new expressway alignment for SH 119 was opened in Longmont, connecting directly from its intersection with US 287 to its terminus at I-25, bypassing the previous congested overlap with US 287. Future CDOT plans various safety upgrades for the section between US 6 and Blackhawk. A diamond interchange is planned for the very busy intersection with SH 52 to ease the congestion at the large IBM facility.

It has been designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument (No: 24001), and is now in the care of the National Trust. The hill is high dominates the low surrounding landscape of the Somerset Levels and is visible from the M5 motorway. Name The word 'knoll' usually means a small hill or hill-top. The origin of the name Brent is unclear, but one possibility is from a word meaning burnt in Old English, suggesting that the settlement was at some time burnt by the Danes.Sylvanus Urban, ed., The Gentleman's Magazine (1846), p. 359: \\"The derivation from burning is not so extravagant, for such, we believe, is the authentic etymology of Brentwood, in Essex\\". Another proposal is that the name comes from a Celtic term meaning \\"high place\\", or even from another Celtic word, briant, meaning law, as the law was anciently promulgated from high places. Another possibility is that the name of Brent simply derives from the local river, the Brent, which gives its name to a Somerset hundred.Benjamin Clarke, The British gazetteer, political, commercial, ecclesiastical (1852), p. 405: \\"The name is evidently derived from its being situated on the banks of the river Brent...\\" Brent Knoll Hill The hill consists of clays and limestone from the Jurassic era and geologically forms an outcrop of the nearby Mendip Hills. Before the Somerset Levels were drained, Brent Knoll was an island, known as the Isle (or Mount) of Frogs, that provided a safe haven from the water and marshes. It temporarily became an island again during the Bristol Channel floods of 1607. There is a small reservoir on the south east flank of the knoll. History =Bronze and Iron Ages= Earthworks at Brent Knoll Brent Knoll has seen human settlement since at least the Bronze Age, becoming an Iron Age Fort about 2,000BC, which covers an area of . It is defended by a single wall around high and by a single ditch, with an entrance on the eastern side, with a second bank on the north east side. It is surrounded by multiple ramparts (multivallate) following the contours of the hill, however these have been heavily damaged by cattle and quarrying. =Roman= The Romans used its summit as a fortification. An urn containing coins of the Roman Emperors Trajan and Severus was found at the site before 1790. Other finds have included pennant sandstone roof tiles and painted wall plaster, indicative of a substantial building that is more likely to have been a temple than a villa. Many of the finds are in the Somerset County and Weston-super-Mare Museums, with Romano-British pottery in the Blake Museum, Bridgwater. =Anglo-Saxon= The fort has been claimed as the site of Mons Badonicus. This was a battle between a force of Britons and an Anglo-Saxon army, probably sometime between 490 and 517 AD.Ashe, Geoffrey, From Caesar to Arthur pp.295‚Äì8 Though it is believed to have been a major political and military event, there is no certainty about its date or place. It is also believed to be the site of a battle in 875 at which forces of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex drove away the Great Heathen Army led by Guthrum, prior to the Treaty of Wedmore, which was signed three years later. =Medieval= Brent Knoll with a sign on the M5 motorway During the medieval era the local land was held by Glastonbury Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. Around the sides and top of the hill are several scarps which may be medieval strip lynchets. =Modern era= Jubilee memorial Limestone was quarried from the knoll, possibly during the 19th century but the exact date is unknown. During World War II it was the site of a gun emplacement manned by the Home Guard. The remains of slit trenches with angle-iron stakes can still be seen on the western and south- western sides. In 1979 the freehold of was acquired by the National Trust from R P P Johnston. The stone marker on the hill, which also serves as a Triangulation station, commemorates the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 2006 a resistivity survey was undertaken at the northern end of the hill fort. It showed several linear features that might be structures. Legend According to legend, Ider son of Nuth, who was one of King Arthur's knights, came to the Mount of Frogs on a quest to slay three giants who lived there.

This is the only one of five former gates of the villa that remains; there was a lost door on the opposite side dating them to 1680 and four other lost inscriptions on the walls of the mansion inside the villa.  Legends  According to a story collected by the erudite Francesco Cancellieri in 1802, a pilgrim named \\"Stibeum\\" (from Latin: stibium, which means \\"antimony\\") was hosted in the villa for a night. That night, the pilgrim, identified later by some as the alchemist Giuseppe Francesco Borri‚Äîknown as Giustiniano Bono‚Äî, searched the gardens of the villa overnight in search of a mysterious herb capable of concocting gold. Legend held that the next morning he was seen to disappear forever through a door, but left behind a few flakes of gold, the fruits of a successful alchemical transmutation, and a mysterious paper full of puzzling symbols and equations, putatively describing the ingredients and process required. The marquis had these symbols engraved on the five gates of the villa Palombara and on the walls of the mansion, hoping that one day they would be translated. A second legend holds that between 1678 and 1680, the same Giuseppe Francesco Borri along with Athanasius Kircher and Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed and built the gate for the marquis. The marquis Palombara developed a passion for alchemy in 1656, when he visited the alchemical laboratory in Riario Palace, now known as Palazzo Corsini. Patronized by the exiled queen Christina of Sweden, the laboratory was supervised by Pietro Antonio Bandiera and had been visited by Borri and Kircher. This tradition holds the gate was built to memorialize a successful alchemical transmutation that occurred in the Riario Palace. It was rumored that Palombara, Bernini and Kircher were all poisoned on 28 November 1680, probably by Borri, for having revealed the secret formulas through the inscriptions on the gate. Cancellieri published his semi-fanciful account in 1806, including his interpretation of the inscriptions on the Porta Alchimica. His work was published in June 1895 in French by Pietro Bornia as an issue of the periodical L'Initiation.  The emblem  The particular drawing on the pediment of the gate, with two overlapping triangles and Latin inscriptions, recapitulates the title page in the posthumous 1677 edition‚Äîwhich differed from the title page of the first edition‚Äîof the alchemical book Aureum Saeculum Redivivum (1621) by Adrian von Mynsicht (known also as Madathanus). In 1747 the emblem was used by Wienner von Sonnenfels in his Splendor lucis, oder Glanz des Lichts. Similarly, the lower part of the emblem by von Mynsicht depicting a \\"centrum in trigono centri\\", was reproduced in a manuscript called the Geheime Figuren der Rosencreutzer (1785‚Äì88). The same drawing appear in a bookmark possessed by B√©renger Sauni√®re, a parish priest at Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau in 1885. It is suggested as well that the geometrical construction of the gate is similar to that of the 21st emblem of Michael Maier‚Äôs Atalanta Fugiens (1617). The signs The seven signs are taken from Johannes de Monte-Snyder, Commentatio de Pharmaco Catholico published in the \\"Chymica Vannus\\" (Amsterdam) in 1666, and follow the sequence of planets, associated to the correspondents metals: Saturn-lead, Jupiter-tin, Mars-iron, Venus-bronze, Mercury, Antinomy and Vitriol.To every planet is associated a watertight maxim, to read from the bottom up to right in order to come down from above on the left, according to the direction indicated from the Hebrew maxim \\"Ruach Elohim\\".  The inscriptions  Porta Alchemica The monument has numerous symbols and inscriptions used in alchemy. The inscriptions are hard to read from the monument itself. Around the circle at top: ‚ÄúThe center is in the triangle of the center.‚Äù Also: ‚ÄúThere are three marvels: God and man, mother and virgin, triune and one.‚Äù The Hebrew inscription, Ruach Elohim, means ‚ÄúSpirit of God.‚Äù Beneath it: ‚ÄúA dragon guards the entrance of the magic garden of the Hesperides, and, without Hercules, Jason would not have tasted the delights of Colchis.‚Äù There are six sigils on the jambs, each with its phrase. Saturn/Lead: ‚ÄúWhen in your house black crows give birth to white doves, then will you be called wise.‚Äù Jupiter/Tin: ‚ÄúThe diameter of the sphere, the tau in the circle, and the cross of the globe bring no joy to the blind.‚Äù Mars/Iron: ‚ÄúHe who can burn with water and wash with fire makes a heaven of earth and a precious earth of heaven.‚Äù Venus/Bronze: ‚ÄúIf you make the earth fly upside down, with its wings you may convert torrential waters to stone.‚Äù Mercury: ‚ÄúWhen azoth and fire whiten Latona, Diana comes unclothed.‚Äù Antimony: ‚ÄúOur dead son lives, returns from the fire a king, and enjoys occult conjugation.‚Äù On the base, Vitriol: ‚ÄúIt is an occult work of true wisdom to open the earth, so that it may generate salvation for the people.‚Äù In another plate, now lost, was the device VILLAE IANUAM TRANANDO RECLUDENS IASON OBTINET LOCUPLES VELLUS MEDEAE 1680 (Passing by opening the door of the villa, Iason obtained the rich fleece of Medea 1680). And on the doorstep, ‚ÄúSI SEDES NON IS,‚Äù an ambiguous quasi-palindrome, meaning both ‚ÄúIf you sit, you do not go,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIf you do not sit, you go.‚Äù  The statues  The standing figures on both sides of the door feature deformed creatures, with short, stout legs and a grotesque bearded face represent a real Egyptian divinity or semi-divinity, called Bes. A patron of the home, childbirth and infants in ancient Egypt, Bes was also known in imperial Rome, where in pre-Christian age several people followed Egyptian cults. Originally the two statues did not belong to Villa Palombara. They were found somewhere near the Quirinal Hill, where in ancient times stood a large temple dedicated to the Egyptian gods Isis and Serapis; century after century, many of its rich decorations, reliefs, small obelisks, etc. were unearthed, and were relocated in different parts of the city. During the works for the opening of piazza Vittorio, in 1888 also these statues were moved from their original location to the Porta Alchemica.

The book is the second book in the acclaimed Skinjacker Trilogy, which takes place in Everlost, a limbo-like place between life and death.  Summary  Everwild continues the stories of Allie and Nick as they pursue separate goals. Allie sets off with Mikey, who was once the terrifying monster, McGill, in the book Everlost, to find her parents in hopes that she might put her spirit to rest; meanwhile, Nick finds himself in a race against time to save the Afterlights from endless entrapment in Everlost by the Sky Witch, Mary Hightower. Traveling in the memory of the Hindenburg, Mary spreads her propaganda and attracts Afterlights to her cause at a frightening speed. Nick, in control of a train, is heading south to gather his own support against Mary. Due to the rumors Mary has spread about the Chocolate Ogre Nick is being overwhelmed by the memory of the chocolate stain on his face, and he is unable to stop the chocolate from spreading over his body. Nick follows the rumor of \\"Zack the Ripper\\", revealed to be Zinnia, a girl who died in the Civil War while pretending to be a boy. Zinnia has the ability to \\"rip,\\" breaking the barrier between the living world and Everlost to pull or push things through. With her abilities, Nick begins to devise a plan to confront and defeat Mary. Meanwhile, together with Mikey, Allie the Outcast travels home to look for her parents and her own life. Along the way, Allie meets three other skinjackers, led by Milos. Allie is tempted by the seductive thrill of skinjacking as she masters the skill, until she discovers the shocking truth about skinjackers: skinjackers are not necessarily dead or alive. Allie's body lies in a comatose state waiting for her soul to rejoin it, and she has the choice whether to remain a skinjacker in Everlost or return to her living body. Mikey discovers that, though he is no longer a monster, he retains the ability to morph himself into monstrous creations of his own mind. Mikey grows jealous of Milos's relationship with Allie. Allie and Mikey part ways with the skinjackers, who Mary later joins forces with. Milos and Allie are skinjacking two teenage couples and Milos kisses Allie who later tells him no but Mikey sees and enraged at Milos and Allie leaves and turns back into a monster again. However later on in the book he captures her and he tells her he loves her and she kisses him and he lets her go. By the end of the book, The Ripper, Allie, and Nick join forces to defeat the evil Mary Hightower and foil her plan to kill all the world's children in order to bring them into Everlost. Nick and the Ripper arrange to meet Mary at a vortex in Graceland, and Zinnia uses her abilities to push Mary into an opening that takes her into the real world. On her way through, Mary manages to grab on to Zinnia and pull her in with her. The vortex's power causes Nick to succumb to memory and become a fully chocolate puddle. The skinjackers, now on Mary's side, blow up a bridge in the living world so that Mary's army can cross over to the unknown land west of the Mississippi River. Allie is captured and strapped to the front of the train. Mikey painstakingly shapes Nick's chocolate puddle into a golem that retains none of Nick's memories or intelligence. Determined to follow Allie, Mikey sinks into the earth with the chocolate golem so that they can cross into the west. Milos meets Mary in the real world, where she asks him to kill her so that she can return to Everlost and continue her crusade.  Setting  The stories in the Skinjacker trilogy takes place in Everlost. Everlost is the place between life and death that all lost children or teenagers below the age of 18 end up after getting lost in their journey to the afterlife, or the light at the end of the tunnel. These lost children, or Afterlights, are unseen by the \\"living\\" world. The Afterlights cannot interact with the real world (except those with the ability to possess, or \\"skinjack,\\" the living) and will sink to the Earth's core if they stay still on living ground. An exception is a \\"deadspot\\", a place where someone has died, where the Afterlights don't sink. There are no adults in Everlost, as it is almost impossible for them to be lost on the path to the afterlife.  Characters  * Alexandra \\"Allie the Outcast\\" Johnson: A fourteen-year-old girl died in the same car crash as Nick. Allie is brave and \\"goal\\" orientated though not a planner. She was reborn nine months later in \\"Everlost\\" as an Afterlight. In the first book, Everlost, Allie discovers that she has the gifted ability to \\"possess or \\"skinjack\\"\\" people. This book continues her quest to travel back home to meet her parents in order to put her troubled mind at ease. Allie discovers she is not really dead and her body lies in a hospital comatose. * Nicholas \\"Nick\\": A fourteen-year-old half- Japanese boy. He in the same car crash as Allie on the way to a wedding when he died with chocolate on his face; now he is stuck in formal clothes and a chocolate covered mouth for eternity. In Everwild, his chocolate smudge has spread and almost half his body is covered in chocolate, thus going by his other name: The Chocolate Ogre, as Mary called him. He travels across the Everwilds on Charlie's ghost train in search of other Afterlights to help him fight Mary. Despite defending their different beliefs on Everlost, Nick still loves Mary and hopes that one day they can see eye-to-eye with each other. * Megan \\"Mary Hightower\\" McGill: The self-proclaimed expert on Everlost. She has written many books on living in the world between life and death. She also thinks of herself as the mother of the many children stuck in this world, being one of the oldest inhabitants at fifteen. She died in a green school dress which adds to her motherly appeal. She will do anything to keep the \\"lost\\" Afterlights in Everlost. Mary has a lunatic plan of destroying the world and bringing the children into Everlost to \\"save\\" them. Despite Mary's new love of Milos later in the book, she still loves Nick deep inside. * Mikey McGill: The brother of Megan McGill, he is fourteen years old, and is trying to redeem himself after spending nearly 30 years \\"kidnapping\\" afterlights after believing a prophecy in a chinese fortune cookie that in exchange for 1000 souls, he can return to the land of the living. He tries his best to keep from returning to the old ways to please Allie. He accompanies Allie in her request to return to her home to meet her parents one last time. Mikey has the ability to change his form into anything he wishes. Mikey may come off as selfish and proud, but he secretly loves Allie with all his heart. When he shows the emotion of love, his afterglow turns a faint lavender color, as do all Afterlights when feeling this emotion. * Milos: A highly skilled Russian skinjacker the age of seventeen that Allie and Mikey team up with in their travels to Memphis, Tennessee. Milos is a tall and handsome Afterlight that shows himself as a gentlemen. During the time he traveled with Allie and Mikey, he taught Allie how to improve her skinjacking, and eventually making her an expert on \\"soul surfing\\"- a quick way to travel from fleshie to fleshie in a way like sling-shotting yourself. He also taught her \\"justicing\\" and \\"terminizing\\". Mikey sees Milos as someone who cannot be trusted, and decides early-on that he despises him. During his travels with Allie and Mikey, Milos tells them about how he was looking for another skinjacker named Jackin' Jill (play on \\"Jack and Jill\\"). Milos's weakness is that he falls in love too easily. He also has a bad habit of saying English phrases the wrong way. * Isaiah: Lead afterlight in Atlanta, Georgia. He may have been a slave. Because of this, he hates/is scared of Zin. * Pugsy Capone: Lead afterlight in Chicago. He and Mary make a deal to team up in leadership, which Mary uses to eventually betray him. * Jill: A skinjacker who works for Pugsy Capone. Also known as Jackin' Jill. She has messy and tangled blond hair with nettles in it. Jill is a tough Afterlight that does whatever she wants most of the time, but serves Pugsy well. She is described by Mary as \\"being like a cat\\" in which she seemed to not have to follow all of Pugsy's rules. She was once in love with Milos, but left him and his friends in a mob's hands. * Moose: A skinjacker who is permanently in football gear. His speech is impeded due to the mouthguard he is wearing. He travels with Milos. Along with Squirrel, their names are a reference to Rocky and Bullwinkle. * Squirrel: A skinjacker who goes by his name by acting squirrely. He often repeats words more than once. He is the second traveler with Milos, along with Moose. Along with Moose, their names are a reference to Rocky and Bullwinkle. * Charlie: A nine- year-old conductor of the ghost train Nick uses to travel. Nick pays him his chocolate to drive him across the Everwilds. * Zinnia \\"Zach The Ripper\\" Kitner: She is a former confederate soldier. the age of fourteen. Zin has the power to \\"ecto-rip\\", or take objects from the living world. She later learns the reverse, putting things from Everlost into the living world.

Arrests were made in the days following the crime; hijackers Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, and hotel receptionist Monde Mbolombo admitted to their involvement in an unintentionally fatal robbery and kidnapping. Facing life in prison, Qwabe and Mbolombo later changed their stories to allege the crime had been a premeditated murder for hire at the behest of Anni's husband Shrien Dewani. Taxi driver Zola Tongo initially claimed to be an innocent victim of the incident but, faced with the weight of evidence implicating him in the crime and in the wake of his fellow conspirators' allegations of a \\"murder for hire\\" plot, he too changed his story to allege the husband was the instigator. Attractive plea bargains were offered to the conspirators in exchange for future testimony in legal proceedings related to the crime. The allegation of the husband's involvement made global headlines; Shrien Dewani's supporters emphatically denied the accusations, saying it was \\"ludicrous\\" to suggest he had solicited an attack on his wife from the first taxi driver he met within hours of their arrival in Cape Town. Zola Tongo pleaded guilty to murder in December 2010 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Mziwamadoda Qwabe pleaded guilty to murder in August 2012 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Xolile Mngeni was tried and convicted of murder in November 2012 and was sentenced to life in prison. Monde Mbolombo admitted his involvement but was offered immunity in exchange for testimony against the other men alleged to have been involved in the crime. South African prosecutors formulated charges against Shrien Dewani based on the later-discredited confessions of Tongo, Qwabe and Mbolombo, who were found to have committed perjury. Charges were brought on the basis Anni had been the victim of a premeditated kidnapping and murder for hire that was staged to appear like a random carjacking, allegedly arranged by her husband. Following a long legal battle, Shrien was extradited from the UK to South Africa to face trial. He was acquitted by a Western Cape High Court, which in December 2014 failed to look at the credible evidence to support the allegations against him nor to support the allegation the crime was a premeditated murder for hire. The key witness Leopald Leisser (with whom Shrien was having an affair) was found to have committed suicide. Shrien Dewani now runs Evolve Care Group and is responsible for seven care homes for the elderly, vulnerable and mentally incapacitated in the Southwest of England. Background =Anni Dewani= The Hindocha family was forced to leave Uganda in the early 1970s after the country's president Idi Amin expelled all Asians living there. They were granted residence in Sweden and settled in Mariestad, where their daughter Anni was born and raised. =Marriage= Anni Hindocha met Shrien Dewani in London in 2009; they maintained a long-distance relationship until Hindocha moved to the UK in March 2010, where they became engaged in May that year. The couple, whose relationship was sometimes troubled, married at Lake Powai near Mumbai, India, on 29 October 2010. They were planning to hold a civil ceremony in the UK in 2011 for friends who could not attend their wedding in India. Robbery, kidnapping and murder After landing at Cape Town International Airport on 7 November 2010, Dewani and her husband took a domestic flight and stayed at Kruger National Park for four nights. On 12 November, the couple returned to Cape Town International Airport, where they met and engaged taxi driver Zola Tongo to drive them to the five-star Cape Grace Hotel. On 13 November, having retained Tongo as a tour guide, the couple were driven through the city in his VW Sharan into Gugulethu. Tongo drove past a BBQ restaurant (Mzolis) and they continued to Surfside Restaurant in Strand, where the couple dined. After their meal, Tongo drove the Dewanis back into Gugulethu. Shortly after turning off the main road, two armed men hijacked the vehicle. After driving a short distance, Tongo was ejected from the taxi. Shrien Dewani was robbed of his money, wallet, designer watch and mobile telephone, and after being driven for about 20 minutes, he was also ejected from the vehicle. On the street, a bystander assisted him by calling the police. At 07:50 on 14 November, in Lingelethu West, Anni Dewani was found dead in the back of the VW Sharan taxi. She had suffered a single gunshot wound to her neck. Police later confirmed Anni's Giorgio Armani wristwatch, a white-gold and diamond bracelet, her handbag and her BlackBerry mobile telephone were missing, and assumed they were stolen. The items stolen in the robbery had an estimated value of R90,000 (USD ). Post-mortem examination, repatriation and cremation The post- mortem examination revealed bruising on her inner leg, indicating she had been involved in a struggle. Sec: \\"The shooting of the deceased\\", (24.1.27.2) It also indicated she had died from a single gunshot that passed through her hand and neck, severing an artery. There was no sign of sexual assault. On 17 November, Dewani's body was released by the South African authorities and returned to the United Kingdom on a British Airways flight, accompanied by her husband. Six months after her death, in a Hindu ceremony, her family scattered her ashes in her favourite area of the V√§nern lake, close to her home town, Mariestad, Sweden. Investigation: sequence of arrests and confessions As a result of a palm print found on the abandoned taxi, Xolile Mngeni was arrested on Tuesday 16 November 2010. Mngeni made a videotaped confession in the presence of Captain Jonker of the South African Police Service, admitting involvement in a hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping operation. He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims and said Qwabe shot Anni Dewani during a struggle for her handbag. Mziwamadoda Qwabe was arrested at around 01:00 on Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of a tip-off from a trusted township informant. After initial denials, Qwabe was allowed to consult with arrested co-conspirators Mbolombo and Mngeni, and subsequently admitted involvement in the hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping. He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims. He changed his story during an interview recorded at 17:21 that day, saying the incident was a murder planned at the behest of Shrien Dewani. Monde Mbolombo was arrested in the early hours of Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of Qwabe providing his name to the police. After initially denying involvement, Mbolombo made a recorded confession at 16:30, admitting arranging a hijacking and armed robbery operation. The confession did not mention a planned murder or Shrien Dewani's involvement. The following day, Mbolombo changed his story, saying the operation was a planned murder at the behest of Shrien Dewani. Taxi driver Zola Tongo reported the hijacking to a police station in Gugulethu after he was ejected from the vehicle, and made a statement saying he was an unknowing victim. On 17 November, Tongo gave a statement to Officer Hendrikse of the SAPS, again saying he was an innocent victim. The following day, Tongo appointed attorney William De Grass, and on Saturday 20 November he surrendered to police and said the operation was a planned murder that was staged to appear as a random hijacking at the behest of Shrien Dewani. Media coverage In South Africa, there was much media coverage of the case following the discovery of the body. With an economy reliant on tourism, tour operators reported an immediate drop in bookings as potential visitors became aware of the country's murder rate; on average, 46 per day. There were also concerns the killing would negate the goodwill resulting from the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The assignment of the Police Hawks team, and the early arrests, conviction and statement implicating Shrien Dewani led to increased media coverage. =BBC Panorama episode = An episode of the BBC television documentary series Panorama in March 2012 reported that the original South African post-mortem report showed the bullet that killed Anni Dewani had passed through her left hand followed by her chest, and that the wound on her neck was an exit wound. The report said the bullet left \\"an irregular gunshot exit wound\\", which suggested there had been a struggle. A second Panorama programme broadcast in September 2013 revisited the case and highlighted numerous inconsistencies between the physical evidence, witness testimony, and the South African prosecutors' purported version of events. In particular it said the forensic evidence had not been collected properly and that it indicated an accidental shooting during a struggle rather than a deliberate killing. Trials, convictions and sentencing =Plea bargains= Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Zola Tongo were offered reduced sentences in exchange for guilty pleas and the promise of truthful testimony against Shrien Dewani and in other criminal proceedings related to the crime. These plea deals were granted in accordance with Section 105A of the Criminal Procedure Act. Monde Mbolombo was granted full immunity from prosecution in exchange for his promise of truthful testimony against Shrien Dewani and in other criminal proceedings related to the crime. This plea deal was granted in accordance with Section 204 of the Criminal Procedure Act. =Conviction and sentencing of Zola Tongo = On 7 December 2010, Zola Tongo appeared in the Western Cape High Court; in accordance with his plea deal under Section 105A of the Criminal Procedure Act, he pleaded guilty to the armed robbery, kidnapping and murder of Anni Dewani‚Äîcrimes he alleged were committed at the behest of Shrien Dewani. According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Tongo was sentenced to 18 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully against Dewani in any future legal proceedings. Tongo was expected to give evidence in the trials of Mngeni and Qwabe in 2011 and 2012. Qwabe avoided trial by pleading guilty pursuant to a Section 105A plea deal. Tongo was not called as a witness at Mngeni's trial in 2012. , Tongo was serving his 18-year sentence in Malmesbury Prison, =Conviction and sentencing of Mziwamadoda Qwabe= In pre-trial hearings on 18 February at Wynberg Magistrates Court, counsel for Mziwamadoda Qwabe said the court was unable to provide a fair trial for his client. Thabo Nogemane said, \\"I am instructed that some unknown police officer assaulted him by means of a big torch. He was hit all over his body. He said the statement was a suggestion put to him by the police. They already had the allegations so they told him: 'Just sign here'. I wouldn't refer to it as a confession, just a statement.\\" According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Qwabe was sentenced to 25 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully in future legal proceedings relating to the case. Qwabe will be eligible for release in 2027. =Trial of Xolile Mngeni and surrounding events= In 2011, Mngeni's lawyer Vusi Tshabalala said his client had been suffocated with a plastic bag before signing a statement admitting his involvement in the killing, further saying police resorted to \\"irregular methods\\" because of the pressure they were under to solve the high-profile case. The start of Mngeni's trial was delayed, and on 13 June 2011 it was announced he had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour. Despite having admitted to his role in the robbery and kidnapping of Anni Dewani in a videotaped confession, Mngeni pleaded not guilty at the start of his 2012 trial, saying he had an alibi and was not at the scene of the crime. Mngeni's lawyers said his initial confession should be ruled inadmissible as evidence because it was allegedly extracted using torture. Justice Robert Henney ruled against Mngeni and said the confession was admissible. Before testifying in the Mngeni trial, key witness Monde Mbolombo read out a prepared statement confessing to lying in his two previous affidavits and promised to tell the truth when testifying. On 19 November 2012, Mngeni was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in jail. The court accepted Mziwamadoda Qwabe's and Monde Mbolombo's version of events, according to which the crime was a contract killing. Mngeni was ruled to have been the person who shot Anni Dewani. The court's findings were superseded by the judgement in the later trial of Shrien Dewani, in which the court found the earlier determinations had been made on the basis of flawed forensic evidence, and perjury of Qwabe and Mbolombo, the two key witnesses. In July 2014, it was confirmed that a medical parole application had been made for Mngeni, who was terminally ill with a brain tumour. He was denied parole and died in jail at the Goodwood Centre of Excellence on 18 October 2014. =Extradition and trial of Shrien Dewani= After a long legal battle, Shrien Dewani was extradited from the United Kingdom to South Africa on 7 April 2014. Upon arrival he was arrested, charged and ordered to stand trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his wife. He was charged with five offences; conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, kidnapping and obstructing the administration of justice. He pleaded not guilty to all five charges. Dewani's trial began on 6 October 2014. Under cross examination, the key witnesses who alleged Dewani's involvement‚ÄîZola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Monde Mbolombo‚Äîcontradicted their previous statements and each other on most of the key elements of the \\"murder for hire\\" story. Tongo and Mbolombo were found to have fabricated telephone calls and text messages that did not exist and refused to identify a fifth conspirator referred to in taped recordings. Qwabe refused to explain to the court why Anni was driven into a residential area. On 24 November 2014, after the close of the prosecution's case, Dewani's counsel argued for the case to be dismissed under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act, citing a lack of credible evidence linking his client to the crime. On 8 December, the application for dismissal under Section 174 was granted by the Honourable Judge Traverso; Dewani was acquitted and exonerated of all involvement with the crimes. In her judgement, Traverso ruled there was no credible evidence linking Shrien Dewani to the crime and explained her ruling by saying: The court overturned the finding of Justice Henney in the Mngeni trial, ruling that Xolile Mngeni could not have been the person who shot Anni, and that some of the key conclusions reached in the 2012 Mngeni trial were erroneous, being based on flawed forensic evidence and the admitted lies of Monde Mbolombo. The court also ruled that Monde Mbolombo had again committed perjury and would not be granted indemnity from prosecution. Judge Traverso said, \\"Before Mr. Mbolombo proceeded with his evidence, he delivered a pre-prepared speech which, from the record, appears to be virtually identical to a similarly emotive speech which he gave the court in the Mngeni trial, before blatantly lying about material aspects.\\" =Monde Mbolombo= Monde Mbolombo has not been prosecuted or punished for his self-confessed role in the crime, nor for his self-confessed perjury whilst testifying. On 19 November 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions decided Mbolombo could not be prosecuted. Complaint about judicial conduct On 22 January 2015, a complaint was lodged by the Higher Education Transformation Network (HETN), alleging judicial bias and prejudiced behaviour of Judge Traverso in the trial of Shrien Dewani. On 25 April that year, a Judicial Conduct Committee dismissed the HETN's complaint, describing it as \\"frivolous\\" and lacking in substance. The National Prosecuting Authority declined to appeal the judgement or lodge any complaint against Judge Traverso. Coroner's inquest After Shrien Dewani's exoneration in December 2014, Anni Dewani's family asked for a coroner's court in the UK to reopen the inquest into her death and to compel Dewani to publicly answer questions. On 9 September 2015, at Brent Coroner's Court in North London, Coroner Andrew Walker said he did not consider a full inquest appropriate because a criminal trial had been conducted in South Africa. On 9 October, Walker confirmed there was insufficient cause to resume an inquest. He told the court he was prohibited from reaching a conclusion that was inconsistent with the findings of the South African courts. Hindocha family statement On 4 August 2018, Anni Hindocha's uncle, acting as spokesperson for the Hindocha family in response to media reports of Shrien Dewani's same-sex relationship, said: \\"We accept he did not murder Anni, but he lied to us and had a very secret gay life. He owes us an apology for his lies\\".

It was located next to Naval Air Station Olathe, now the grounds of New Century AirCenter. History In 1950 the United States Air Force Air Defense Command selected Olathe NAS as a site for one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent ADC general radar surveillance network for the United States. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Olathe was to provide defense radar coverage of the Kansas City area. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction of a radar station on the western part of the ground station, about a mile from the runway and ramp/hangars being used by the Navy. Additional housing units were also constructed at Olathe to accommodate the Air Force personnel. The Federalized Utah Air National Guard 130th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the site on 1 June 1951 at the facilities of the 2472d Air Force Reserve Training Command, and initially the station functioned as a Ground control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. It was relieved from active duty and returned to control of the State of Utah on 1 February 1953. The Ground Air Transmitting Receiving (GATR) Site for communications was located at , approximately 0.4 miles north from the main site. Normally the GATR site was connected by a pair of buried telephone cables, with a backup connection of dual telephone cables overhead. The Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) (AN/FST-2) at the main site converted each radar return into a digital word which was transmitted by the GATR via microwave to the Control Center. The national guardsmen were replaced by the 738th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W;) was activated at was designated by ADC as Olathe Air Force Station, being designated P-72. The squadron began operations in using AN/CPS-4 and AN/FPS-3 radars. The AN/CPS-4 soon was replaced by an AN/FPS-4 set that in turn was superseded by a pair of AN/FPS-6A sets in 1958. In 1958 this site also replaced the AN/FPS-3 set with an AN/FPS-20 search radar. Olathe AFS used these radars in conjunction with the Nike missile Army Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) KC-65DC (1959‚Äì1969).Wikimapia: Nike Site KC-65DC In 1958, the United States Army established an Air-Defense Command Post (AADCP) KC-65DC with the Air Force radar station at Olathe for Nike missile command-and-control functions as part of the Kansas City Defense Area. The site was equipped with the AN/GSG-5(V) BIRDIE solid-state computer system. The Army radars were fully integrated with the Air Force network, and both Army and Air Force personnel operated the radars. In addition to the main facility, Olathe AFS operated the AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler site: * Garland, KS (P-72A) In late 1959 this station was also performing air-traffic-control duties for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In the early 1960s the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-66. During late January 1961 Olathe AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-22 at Sioux City AFS, Iowa. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 793d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 February 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-72. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In September 1968 the Air Force inactivated the 738th Radar Squadron due to budget reductions and a general phase-down of Air Defense Command.

Industrial Engineering in 1986.http://open-days.eu/file-upload/2010/docs/768-05A26-CV_Millan_2010.pdf He worked in Barringer Research Ltd in Toronto, specializing in design of instruments for geological exploration. Working there he designed electro- magnetic reels to measure nickel sulfide at a mine. This design, after the Munich terrorist attacks, was asked to be readjusted for people as metal detectors and these are still used in airports today. From 1967 on he works designing electro-optical instruments to measure gases in industrial processes, and during 1968-1970 he designed COSPEC (Correlation SPECtrometer) to measure remote gases in the atmosphere. This work was financed by NASA, and is used as his thesis in Atmospheric Physics. COSPEC was the first commercial instrument to measure remote atmospheric contaminants in movement at real timing. It received many prizes and was given the IR-100 for ‚ÄòOne of the best instrumental designs in 1970' by the Nobel Prize panel in Boston. COSPEC appears in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, is currently used in more than 40 countries, and has more than 500 scientific references, including magazines such as SCIENCE and NATURE. In 1972, Dr. Mill√°n started working for the National Meteorological Center of Canada, responsible for contaminant dispersion in the atmosphere. In 1973, he was asked by the European Commission Community to be the main adviser in environment and climate. He studied and optimized the system of atmospheric dispersion and contaminant measuring of the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and RDA. He co-organized six campaigns of atmospheric contaminants in Europe during 1974-1983. Since 1974, he‚Äôs been named adviser ‚Äúad personam‚Äù of the European Community, choosing the science priorities of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Marco programs. Dr. Mill√°n was the first person to measure the dispersal of a contaminant plume more than 400 km in 1976. This was fundamental for society to consider, that atmospheric contamination isn‚Äôt limited by the small area where it may be produced, but affects, in different measure, all the planet. It has also appeared in the movie ‚ÄòDante's Peak‚Äô and ‚ÄòSurviving St. Helen's‚Äô by the BBC, as well as used in most Volcanic Studies.http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Monitoring/Descriptions/description_COSPEC.html Since 1991, he has been the director of the CEAM (Center of Environmental Studies of the Mediterranean) currently with 90 investigators at his charge. He is considered a specialist of the Mediterranean basin and the climate change in the Mediterranean coast. He coordinates various I+D (Investigation and development) programs in the European Community, from NATO / CCMS air pollution modeling to part of the board of directives of the European Science Foundation since 2003, etc. Is author of more than 96 scientific publications, has given numerous courses, master and seminars and has directed nine thesis.

The project uses mug shots of repeat offenders to demonstrate the harmful and damaging effects of methamphetamine on its users. The idea for Faces of Meth began in 2004 when deputy Bret King of the Corrections Division Classification Unit used mug shots to identify individuals with a history of using methamphetamine. King and his co-workers collected images of people charged with crimes related to methamphetamine addiction to document the change in physical appearance over time due to the use of the drug. The project uses before and after mug shot photos to show the physical deterioration of the user as a result of using methamphetamine. The images were originally used in educational slideshow and video presentations delivered to students in Oregon high schools. This Faces of Meth drug prevention strategy has since become popular across the United States. Background Steve Suo, staff writer for The Oregonian, began an investigation into the methamphetamine epidemic taking place on the West Coast of the United States in late 2002. Oregon was especially hit hard by methamphetamine at the time, with more addicts per capita than any other state. Suo's story was published in October 2004 as \\"Unnecessary Epidemic\\", a five-part investigative series.Faces of Meth, 2005: \\"The efforts of this project were first published in the Oregonian as part of their focused efforts on the methamphetamine epidemic ... The Multnomah County Sheriff‚Äôs Office has provided the pictures posted in the Oregonian Faces of Meth\\" story on December 28, 2004 to others who are involved in methamphetamine prevention and awareness efforts.\\" See also: Around the same time, deputy Bret King was working at the Multnomah County Detention Center when he witnessed a 20-year- old woman experience amphetamine psychosis in her cell. After glancing at her mug shot and seeing how the drug had physically changed her appearance, King began to collect booking photos of methamphetamine users on a daily basis, eventually creating \\"the faces of meth\\", a slideshow of \\"the most extreme faces\\" altered by the devastating effects of meth use. Two months later, on December 28, 2004, Oregonian reporter Joseph Rose published \\"Faces of Meth\\", the first to highlight the before and after photos King had collected. Rose's article discussed the development of King's drug prevention project and the physiological effects of methamphetamine on the human body. In May 2005, several of King's images were published as a public service poster in a partnership between The Oregonian and the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office.Bottomly 2010: \\"Later, reporter Joseph Rose wrote the memorable \\"Faces of Meth,\\" which became a public service poster printed by The Oregonian.\\" For the original PSA poster, see: King and the Faces of Meth project appeared on NBC Nightly News in August of that same year. In February 2006, the public affairs television program Frontline aired \\"The Meth Epidemic\\", a documentary produced in association with The Oregonian. The Frontline episode featured King and showed images from the Faces of Meth project in the first segment, \\"Uncovering Meth's History and Spread\\". Images and videos The Faces of Meth project uses before and after mug shots of arrestees to demonstrate the harmful effects of using methamphetamine. The images often depict signs of premature aging, facial scarring from picking scabs, and advanced tooth decay, commonly referred to as meth mouth. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office has also published several slideshows and videos. Faces of Meth was originally released in 2005 on a CD containing 59 images and a PowerPoint presentation for educating youths about the dangers of methamphetamine. This public education strategy, intended to discourage drug use, has since become popular across the United States. According to Bret King, the images were effective in communicating the message of the drug prevention project: > What I've observed when kids watch my program is they become pretty > uncomfortable ... People cover up their faces. They can't look ... They feel > sick to their stomach. But I think the most visible thing is their facial > expression or the verbal utterances they make ‚Äì gasps in the audience ... I > want that shock value to be there. I want to make an impact that lasts with > these people. I want them to not forget what they've seen. In 2009, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released From Drugs to Mugs, a new 48-minute documentary and expanded update of the Faces of Meth drug prevention strategy. The video \\"illustrates the dangers and potential outcomes of the decision to experiment with drugs\\" using interviews with inmates arrested for drug-related crimes and testimony from the people who work with them in the judicial system. Questions in the interview were based on a 2008 survey of almost 500 high school students who were asked about the most important elements in their decision to use or abstain from using drugs. Reaction Reactions to the project were positive, but some concerns were raised about privacy law. Max Margolis of Oregon Partnership's YouthLink Program described the shocking imagery as an \\"honest tactic\\", because \\"the damage to the body, the rapid degeneration ‚Äì those are realities of the drug.\\" Douglas J. Edwards, Editor-in-Chief of Behavioral Healthcare, criticized the project's methods, stating that permission was not obtained from the subjects, and that the identities of the subjects could have been concealed using black bars to block the eyes. According to the Faces of Meth project, all of the mug shots they use are public records and do not require permission. Researchers Travis Linnemann and Tyler Wall have described Faces of Meth as a racial project where hierarchies of whiteness and white social position are reproduced and maintained.

It was founded in 2008 by Lu√≠s Faria, its president, and Matilde Monteiro Pais, vice- president. Contradit√≥rio is a freestanding, nonprofit, nonpartisan and nongovernmental think-and-do tank.TEDxEdges. \\"A Portuguese Think Tank: New Ideas and Discussions\\", TEDxEdges, October 2010. Contradit√≥rio Think Tank advocates both personal and economic liberty: free minds, free markets and the effectiveness of individual responsibility. Principles Contradit√≥rio defends each person‚Äôs right to liberty and property. Contradit√≥rio agrees with the ideas of rule of law, representative government and limits on power, private property and the free market, and tolerance. Contradit√≥rio advocates that individuals should have the freedom to live their life in any peaceful chosen way and to realize their full potential, considering the prohibition to use force against others except in defence and honoring and respecting the peaceful choices and the equal rights of others. Contradit√≥rio advocates that all human relationships should be voluntary and that the scope of government must be limited and its major function must be to protect people's freedom: to preserve law and order, to enforce private contracts and to foster competitive markets. The key principles of Contradit√≥rio‚Äôs philosophy include the following: Individualism: Individualism rests on the idea that the individual is the relevant unit of social analysis. Contradit√≥rio emphasizes the dignity of each individual, which entails both rights and responsibility. It is a misunderstanding, in scientific and ethical grounds, to think that individualism involves in any sense an egoistic system of values. Egoism is inconsistent both with the idea that individuals are ends in themselves and the defense of individual rights. Individual rights: The principle of individual rights defends that persons exist as ends in themselves, they are not mere resources for others to use. The use of force, coercion or fraud may not be initiated against individuals and individuals have a natural right to be secure in their life, liberty and property. These rights are not granted by government or by society. The rule of law: The rule of law serves to protect the rights of individuals. Contradit√≥rio strives for a society of liberty under law, in which individuals are free to pursue their own projects so long as they respect the equal rights of others. Spontaneous order: Contradit√≥rio believes that order in society arises spontaneously, out of the voluntary and cooperative actions of individuals who coordinate their actions with the actions of others in order to achieve their purposes, to survive and flourish. Limited government: Contradit√≥rio stands for limited government, generally through a constitution enumerating and limiting the powers that the people delegate to government. Contradit√≥rio believes that rights and individuals should be protected from governments. Free markets: The right to property entails the right to exchange property by mutual agreement. Free markets are the economic system of free individuals, and they are necessary to create wealth. To survive and to flourish, individuals need to engage in economic activity and individuals will be both freer and more prosperous if government intervention in people‚Äôs choices is minimized. Merit: A freer world would be far more meritorious than the world of today. Hard work, more work, higher- quality work and more and cleverer ideas are all meritorious, and they all create value. Market is not perfect but market and merit work well together. The virtue of production: Like in the past there was a reaction against those who lived off the productive labor of other people, Contradit√≥rio now stands for the right of productive people to keep the outcomes of their labor. Natural harmony of interests: Interests among peaceful, productive people in a just society are harmonious and we serve ourselves best by serving others. Natural harmony of interests is predicated on the idea that individual interests in the long-run are harmonious insofar as acting in one‚Äôs own interest furthers the interests of the community. Peace: Contradit√≥rio battles the blight of war that brings death and destruction, disrupts family and economic life, and it is the common enemy of peaceful and productive people. Activities Contradit√≥rio publishes papers combining the evidence-based approach with the engagement in civic intervention.M&A; Portal. \\"The think tank Contradit√≥rio summarises the recent development of the private equity industry in Portugal\\" , Bureau van Dijk, July 2010.M&A; Portal. \\"Contradit√≥rio examines austerity measures in Portugal\\" , Bureau van Dijk, August 2010. Contradit√≥rio's papers aim to stimulate the debate and to scrutinize ideas and policies. Contradit√≥rio also promotes debates in which the opposition of arguments tend to the clarification of the discussion and to build a well informed opinion.Teixeira da Mota, Francisco. \\"A ades√£o √†s redes sociais e a perda de privacidade\\", Jornal P√∫blico, 10 April 2010. Retrieved 10 April 2010.Universidade Cat√≥lica Portuguesa. \\"Pol√≠ticas contra-c√≠clicas em debate\\" , Universidade Cat√≥lica Portuguesa, May 2010. In its articles Contradit√≥rio gives the floor to its readers and invites personalities from different fields to participate in discussions and comment on the latest topics. In January 2011 Contradit√≥rio has launched the \\"Free Market of Political Ideas\\", an innovative way of bringing together citizens and the political ideas that shape their lives. The Free Market of Political Ideas gives people the possibility to value and scrutinize the ideas of the most relevant debates, political parties and their candidates. Scholars Contradit√≥rio tends to balance research and analysis on a wide range of policy issues and public outreach and as an academic-diversified think tank welcomes the heterogeneity of subjects based on an innovative approach of facing problems and looking for solutions. It has Working Groups on a broad range of public policy issues - Education and Culture, Economy and Finance, International Affairs and Political Science, Law, Science, Innovation and Technology, Entrepreneurship, Society - on which its members conduct policy research.

It serves as the administrative headquarters of the South East Delhi district of Delhi. It is popular for being centrally located to all major parts of the city, its well maintained parks, broad streets, active community clubs and notable residents from entertainment and politics. Defence Colony is home to many restaurants, coffee shops, art galleries and high-end shops. On July 17, 2020 Defence Colony made international headlines for leading the call to boycott Chinese goods, after 'Declaring war on China'. Overview Defence Colony was created in the aftermath of the partition in 1947. Newly independent India allotted land to resettle serving Indian military officers whose homes lay across the new border in Muslim-majority Pakistan. Besides its central location from most parts of the city of Delhi, the locality is immensely popular among all Delhiites for the exotic varieties of cuisines that it has on offer . There are many restaurants in Defence Colony. Defence Colony Welfare Association Club, commonly referred as Defence Colony Club was established in 1976 as Defence Colony Ex. Services Institute, however it was renamed in 1980, and functions under the Defence Colony Welfare Association. Historic monuments Close to the main Defence Colony market inside a round about, stands the octagonal tomb of Shaikh Ali, known as \\"Gumti of Shaikh Ali\\". Built in the 15th-century Lodhi dynasty-era, near the historic area of Kotla Mubarakpur, it housed two graves inside the tomb till early 20th-century, which are now long gone. The tomb houses the Defence Colony Welfare Association (DCWA) office, since 1960. Transportation Defence Colony is accessible by many means of public transport including auto rickshaw, taxi, Delhi Transport Corporation buses as well as the Delhi Metro. The closest metro station to most of Defence Colony is Lajpat Nagar, which is an interchange station between the Violet Line and Pink Line. For some parts of the Defence Colony, it is closer to walk to South Extension metro station, which is on the Pink Line. To the Northeast of Defence Colony is the Sewa Nagar railway station of the Delhi Ring Railway. To the South, Defence Colony is bounded by the Ring Road. To its East and West are Lala Lajpat Rai Marg and Bhishma Pitamah Marg respectively. The North of Defence Colony is bounded by the tracks of the Delhi Ring Railway.

Unfortunately we cannot take up guns and bullets but definitely there are other means. We can break China's backbone economically and today I request you all, with immediate effect, shun Chinese goods and if you have any lying in your house, please throw them out,\\" he added. His call to boycott Chinese goods received national and international support.

History J S Peters & Son Ltd. have been involved in library supply and general bookselling since 1935 with the opening of their first shop in Moor Street, Birmingham, by John Sheldon Peters. The company is still owned by the Peters family, being wholly owned by Malcolm Peters and his two sons. Malcolm retired in 2009 and his son Rhydian replaced him as chairman. In January 2011, Ray Dyer was appointed Managing Director of the business. In 1992 a subsidiary, The Kit Shop, was launched to supply furniture to libraries and schools. In 2012 Peters Bookselling Services and The Kit Shop were rebranded as Peters Books & Furniture, with both aspects of the business brought under one roof at 120 Bromsgrove Street, Birmingham.  Services  Peters has an unrivalled showroom of over 30,000 children‚Äôs books, including a one-of-a-kind Accelerated Reader showroom containing over 11,000 AR-quizzed books, as well as a furniture showroom. These showrooms are open for visits from schools and libraries. Peters‚Äô team of qualified children‚Äôs librarians read and review every book held in stock in the showroom. They also offer a bespoke selections service to help customers select books, as well as a range of book packs covering various topics across the curriculum and to support reading for pleasure for 0-18 year olds. Peters also have a jacketing and labelling service for books for schools and libraries, including everything from plastic jackets to Book Band and Accelerated Reader labels. Peters Book of the Year In 2010 Peters launched the Peters Book of the Year award. Nominations are selected by Peters‚Äô own in-house children‚Äôs librarians, with the criteria that the book be classed as a children‚Äôs book and have been published during the nomination year. Schools and libraries nationwide can get involved in shadowing the awards and the voting is done through several channels ‚Äì in the showroom, online, and by post. The winner is announced the following year. In 2012 the awards grew to encompass best picture book and best fiction book, and in 2014 the fiction award was further split into junior and teen categories. Originally named to reflect the year in which the books were published, in 2014 the decision was made to name the award after the year in which the winners were announced, hence the 2014 award became the 2015 award. =2010= Winner: White Crow by Marcus Sedgwick (Orion Children‚Äôs Books) =2011= Winner: A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness (Walker Books) =2012= Picture book winner: Cinderelephant by Emma Dodd (Templar Publishing) Fiction winner: A Boy and a Bear in a Boat by Dave Shelton (Yearling) =2013= Picture book winner: The Day the Crayons Quit by Drew Daywalt and Oliver Jeffers (HarperCollins Children‚Äôs Books) Fiction winner: Demon Dentist by David Walliams (HarperCollins Children‚Äôs Books) =2015= Picture book winner: Smelly Louie by Catherine Rayner (Macmillan Children‚Äôs Books) Junior fiction winner: A Room Full of Chocolate by Jane Elson (Hodder Children‚Äôs Books) Teen fiction winner: A Song for Ella Grey by David Almond (Hodder Children‚Äôs Books) =2016= The shortlists will be announced in November 2015 (TBC), with the winners announced in March 2016 (TBC) See also * Book trade in the United Kingdom  References   External links  *Peters' books for schools website *Peters' furniture website Category:Bookshops of the United Kingdom Category:History of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:1935 establishments in England Category:British companies established in 1935 Category:Retail companies established in 1935 ","title":"Peters Bookselling Services"},{"id":"30544835","text":"Marta Zofia Kwiatkowska is a Polish theoretical computer scientist based in the United Kingdom.

The site is across the river from the village of Turners Falls. This was one of the most important conflicts of King Philip's War, as it marked a turning point in the conflict that would eventually lead to the war's end. A largely untrained, inexperienced militia force of 150-160 engaged in an initial massacre and looting of the Peskeompskut camp, killing around 100-200 people. Conducting a fighting withdrawal after the counterattack through ambushes set by the Algonquian tribe's outnumbered warriors, resulting in the deaths of 38 militiamen (including William Turner) and the wounding of an unknown number. Background Wissantinnewag-Peskeompskut was an established annual fishing encampment along the Connecticut River, where some land had been cleared of dense woods for spring planting and other land leveled to accommodate wetus (domed huts used by Algonquins) on around 300 acres of choice land.10 At least twice yearly, for thousands of years, People came to Peskeompskut to fish, plant, and harvest food for the year.1,2 The Spring of 1676 found this ancestral fishing and planting place more busy than was usual, as King Philip's War had displaced many from the south and access to food in other areas controlled by the Nipmuc had been destroyed in the conflict. By mid-May 1676, warriors and families of Nipmuc, Narragansett, Wampanoag and Pocumtuc warriors gathered for the fishing runs. As King Philip's War was ongoing, this year three camps were established. One camp was downriver from the main camp and closer to the conflict areas on what is now ‚ÄúSneed‚Äôs Island‚Äù: most of the warriors stayed in that camp. The main camp had women, children, elderly and those focused on farming & fishing. Another camp was across the river from that camp.8 By mid-May, 1676, peace talks between the Colony of Connecticut and the Narragansett were in the early stages, with some prisoner releases being made to establish good faith. Some of these releases included those who had been taken captive during an earlier raid on Hatfield. The Connecticut War Council directed the northernmost settlers in Hatfied, Hadley and Northampton to take no aggressive action and also recalled the army under Major Savage. They also recalled a large part of Captain William Turner's company, leaving him with ‚Äúa company of single men, boys and servants‚Äù.8 While the presence of those troops during the winter had caused shortages, the reduction of military support caused concern amongst the settlers.1 This concern was amplified by the large and growing encampment of Nipmuc and others around the falls.1 On May 13th, 1676, some of the warriors camped in Peskeompskut raided nearby farms and carried off 70 cattle and horses.1,8 Two days later, some of the recently released gave a detailed accounting of the encampment, the fenced cattle area and other intelligence to the local leaders. The settlers resolved to act without the approval of the Connecticut War Council. Captain William Turner and his Lieutenant Samual Holyoke gathered together a company of volunteers from the nearby river towns and prepared to attack the encampment. Prelude On May 18, 1676, there was an uncommon feast of beef and milk from the Hatfield raid to accompany the staple salmon at Peskeompskut.8 After dinner, the warriors returned to their camp leaving the main camp unguarded. To the south, Captain Turner, the remains of his soldiers and settlers from the northernmost towns gathered in Hatfield with the purpose of attacking the encampment at Peskeompskut. They were a largely untrained, inexperienced militia force who were planning on attacking a seasoned group of 60-70 warriors in their own territory. They banked on the numerical advantage, over 160 men, and the element of surprise to make up the difference. They left on horseback after nightfall, riding through a thunderstorm, which may have occluded them from posted Nipmuc sentries. They also crossed the Connecticut River ‚Äúat the mouth of Sheldon‚Äôs brook‚Äù to avoid the sentries at the usual place of crossing.1,12 They crossed the Green River ‚Äúat the mouth of the Ash Swamp brook to the east, skirting the great swamp‚Äù 1,8. Captain Turner and his men found themselves on a high land just south of Mount Adams overlooking Peskeompskut in the predawn hours of May 19, 1676. Leaving their horses, they walked down to the encampment. They arranged a signal to begin firing and then advanced into the encampment. They were able to get within point-blank range of the wetus. Engagement At dawn, the signal was given and Captain Turner's men began firing into the wetus, some through the exits to insure no escape. ‚ÄúA great and notable slaughter‚Äù ensued.10 Those not killed in the initial fusillade ran away from the men towards the Connecticut River, attempting to cross by canoe or by swimming. Some were heard to yell ‚ÄúMohawk! Mohawk!‚Äù as they fled. The canoes were soon overfilled with the desperate. Captain Turner's men lined up along the shoreline and opened fire on both the swimmers and those in the canoes.1 Some of those not killed by bullets were swept over the falls; others found refuge under overhanging rocks but were also found and killed. ‚ÄúCaptain Holyoke killing five, young and old, with his own Hands from under a bank.‚Äù5 He was also credited with ‚Äúkilling four native children with one swipe of his sword‚Äù. 9 A survivor reported that ‚Äúshot came as thick as rain‚Äù. 1 Reportedly, over 100 were dead on the shore and around 130 perished in the river. None of Captain Turner's men were killed by return fire, though one man died as he emerged from a wetu and was shot by friends who thought him a native.5,8 Even though he knew that there were likely warriors around, Captain Turner ordered the destruction of the camp. They burned all the wetus and their contents.8 They destroyed the stores of dried or smoked fish. They found two blacksmith forges and tools for fixing arms and bullets; they took the blacksmith tools and threw them into the river.8 They plundered what they could carry and3 freed an English captive, who informed them that King Philip and 1000 warriors were nearby. Around the time of this disclosure, the warriors who had camped elsewhere began a concerted counterattack. An immediate retreat was ordered.1 Once mounted, Captain Turner and his men retreated along the westerly route that they had come but without the cover of darkness or thunderstorm that had helped them in their approach. Surviving Peskeompskut warriors harried the rear of the company, whilst other warriors from encampments to the south of Peskeompskut laid an ambush near White Ash Swamp.1 When the force rode near White Ash Swamp, they were attacked from all sides. The command structure and discipline immediately dissolved in the inexperienced, largely citizen militia. The group separated into 3-5 smaller groups, with most of the soldiers following Captain Turner's force heading directly for another ambush at Green River Ford.1 The narrow valley leading to Green River Ford was well known as being ideal for ambush. ‚Äúin a dangerous Passe, which they were not sufficiently aware of, the skulking Indians, killed at one Volley, the said Captain and Eight and Thirty of his Men; but immediately after they had discharged, they fled‚Äù3. Warriors ambushed the company there and Captain Turner was shot through the thigh and back as he crossed the river.10 Samuel Holyoke, took command and organized a retreat to Hatfield that lost no men. Reverend Hope Atherton got separated from the main body and had to find their way alone; a few were successful while others never returned. Aftermath Captain Turner's body lay in the river for several days until it was recovered. Of the 160 men who attacked Peskeomskut, 38 were killed outright in the retreat or tortured to death (nearly a quarter of his men), six were missing (later found) and many had wounds that shortened their lives. On May 30th, 1676, 250 surviving warriors from Peskeompskut attacked Hatfield. Though their attack was repulsed, 5 settlers were killed, 20 houses and barns were burned, many cattle were killed, sheep were driven away, and a number of houses & shops looted.12 In June, English scouts found places where Captain Turner's captured men were tortured and burned. 12 The falls where this occurred were later named ‚ÄúTurner‚Äôs Falls‚Äù. In 1736, a grant was made to the descendants of the ‚ÄúFalls Fight‚Äù of land near the conflict (currently the town of Bernardson). ‚ÄúThe village of Riverside, in Gill, is supposed to occupy the spot where the fight took place, and in that village a grove used by picnic parties is said to mark the precise locality of Capt. Turner's first attack upon the Indian camp‚Äù.6 The site of the battle is in the Riverside Archeological District, a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There is an extensive account of the battle and the colonists' reasons for attacking contained in a book authored by George Madison Bodge and reprinted by the Genealogical Publishing Company in 1967. The account includes a description of the battle, a listing of many of the soldiers who fought with the colonists, the soldiers who were slain in the battle, and soldiers or their descendants who were entitled to land due to their participation in the battle.

The historical residence of the Society of Jesus, this site was transformed to support pilgrims to the site, and is marked by a chapel delineated by Corinthian columns, supporting plinths surmounted by simple frieze and cornice. The interior was decorated in azulejo tile of polychromatic vegetal design, with triumphal arch dividing the sanctuary from the college, identifiable by the large granite rock in its interior, where legend says the image of the Virgin Mary was first discovered. In this space is the oratory of Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Sorrows) with its nativity by Ant√≥nio Ferreira (particularly visible in the juxtaposition of various representations). In the junction between presbytery and sacristy is the double-arched belfry. Also remarkable and unique for this site, and other buildings owned by the Society of Jesus, is the walkway that connects the residences of the complex with the church. From the architects of the sanctuary, the property had 126 palmos, which was equal to length by 40 wide by 5 palmos in height. In the north wing, there were four cells with windows to the cloister, 18 palmos squared, that included space for a bed, bunk for study, oratory and armoire, with dividing walls three palmos thick. There were also cells in the southern wing, opening onto the courtyard. In the west, the cubicles of hall of study, armoires for clothing, latrines and in the extreme end the library. On the opposite wall, a staircase connected to the lower floors, where the chapel, rooms, lavatories, rectory, kitchen and toilets. The main floor, with vaulted ceiling and wood floors. In the north were 12 merchant tents, rented for 10$000 reis. At the end, were the stores for bread, legumes, olive oil, wine and other basics. Taking advantage of the slope, a basement was constructed to be used as stables, hay loft, hot house, woodshed, chicken coop and sanitary holding tanks. In the cloister were planted apple trees, plum trees, roses and carnations. History =Origin= In the 9th century, the nuns who abandoned the Convent of Sismeiro, destroyed in 982 by Almansor, transported with them a small image of Nossa Senhora da Lapa (\\"Our Lady of the Rock\\", roughly translated), which they hid in Quintela.Ab√≠lio Louro Carvalho (2002), p.171 It was only in 1498, that the first cult to Senhora da Lapa was started, after the image was discovered in the rocks of the village, by a mute child named Joana. The construction of an altar, was done through the initiative of the abbey of S√£o Paio, in the parish of Vila da Rua, who became the first guardian, collecting alms from the parishioners for the construction of a temple. The faithful began to visit, in pilgrimage, to the place with the image was found during the first years of the 16th century. =Kingdom= By the first half of the 16th century, owing to dispute between the Bishop of Lamego and King, over the region of Senancelhe, the patron of the sanctuary and parish of Rua became independent. The abbey began to select his successor and renounced his role in the presence of Pope Julius III. His successor, Fern√£o Pires, nominated Father Bartolomeu Madureira, who was unpopular with the local community. Between 1555 and 1559, there was a demand from Rome that the Portuguese Crown should promote the rights of the Vatican in Senancelhe. Consequently, King Sebastian donates Rua and church annexes to the Society of Jesus, from the College of Coimbra. On 17 September 1575, Pope Gregory XIII sanctioned the transfer, and by December the College of Coimbra nominated their first vicar to Rua, Father Pedro Rodrigues. Within the same year, the construction of the first dependencies for the priests, alongside the church (along the north of the hermitage) and another one-storey structure to the west, began being constructed. In 1586, the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrement () was founded in the old sacristy by local patrons that included the first Baron of Moss√¢medes, master of the Morgadia of Sernancelhe and Counts of Lapa, Pedro de Soveral (nobleman in the house of the King), from the Order of Christ. In 1610, a visitor, Father Jo√£o √Ålvares, recommended the construction of an actual sanctuary, which was begun, and would actually be the center of the devotion to Nossa Senhora da Lapa in Portugal, India and Brazil, through missionaries who travelled from this location. The ordered construction included iron grades, a portable altar to the north, remodelling of the dependencies and construction of a house for the treasurer, while expanding the religious buildings, courtyard and purchasing guesthouses for visitors. In addition, there was the authorization to cover the altar in a wood structure, and construct a gilded altar dedicated to the Baby Jesus, flanked by images of Saints Ignatius and Francis Xavier. A triumphal arch and extension to the church body also progressed, with the respective axial and transversal porticos in the south, along with a third doorway to access the sacristy and guesthouse. To the north, the Casa dos Pesos was constructed, with collateral retables, as well as a pulpit in front of the Chaepl of Santo Cristo. In 1626, a cross was constructed in Trancoso. The principal building project was completed in 1635, and included an annex Casas de Novenas, to support pilgrims that wished to stay overnight, and the Estalagem das Varandas, a two-storey building for more affluent pilgrims. To the south, they erected tents (later substituted by nine vaulted shops), and in the courtyard 30 quarters eventually popped-up, housing 100 people. The walls of the church, meanwhile, were painted by Manuel Henriques, a cleric in the Society of Jesus, consisting of 24 panels that also depicted the pastoral life of Joan, and the miracles of the Virgin Mary.The 24 panels represented: Fuga das religiosas (Flight of the Religious), Descoberta da imagem (Discovery of the Image), Senhora na gruta (Our Lady in the Grotto), nine panels referring to unspecified miracles, Liberta√ß√£o de dois cativos (Liberation of two captives), five miracles, two panels depicting the rescue of shipwrecked peoples, Praga de gafanhotos (Plague of Locusts), Prociss√£o na Lapa (Procession in Lapa), Cura de 2 paral√≠ticos (Healing two paralyzed), and Amortalhados oferecem-se √† Virgem (The Dead Offering Suplications to the Virgin). It was likely that at about the same time the paintings in the sacristy were painted at about the same time. In 1639 there was a reference to two silver-plate lamps on the site. On 13 July 1654, the municipal council donated to the Jesuits the uncultivated lands around the church to construct their college, which were immediately encircled by small wall until the presbytery. During the 1670s, the Jesuits began accumulating more benefits and gifts: in 1671, Manuel Rodrigues Ramos and his wife (of Arneir√≥s) gifted a golden chair; in September 1676, the bishop Jo√£o de Melo, gave the Jesuits a silver-plated crown, encircled with 20 precious stones; in 1677, King Pedro II also donated a silver crown studded in diamonds; the clergy of the realm also donated, in 1678, a simple silver crown; on 3 September 1679, there was a donation of red canopy, flaked with silver, by the descendants of Soutelo; in August 1682, Isabel Proen√ßa, of Penamacor, donated an amber pear covered in flakes of gold and painted in green and white, to the Baby Jesus; another member of the congregation donated 17 reliquaries to the sanctuary; and, on 22 September, Ant√≥nio Fernandes Matos sent from Pernambuco (in Brazil) 50$000 r√©is. Father Ant√≥nio Cordeiro, around 1682, petitioned the provincial branch of the Society, to allow the construction of a residence, and in 1682, a formal plan was sent to Rome for approval. On 9 September 1684, the general council authorized the construction of a building for three to four residents, with eight to ten cubicles, to shelter priests that passed through Bragan√ßa, in addition to two spaces for the bishop's living quarters, when he annually visited the sanctuary. The cornerstone was laid on 28 July 1685 for the residence, alongside the sanctuary, in order to support the Jesuits whom assisted the Easter celebrations (which was connected to the Church by a catwalk). In 1703, Father Cordeiro returned to Lapa, in order to assist the construction of the residence and new sacristy. By 1714, the college was completed, and classes in Latin and Morals were begun, under Chaplin Jo√£o Marques Luseiro. The gifts continued to pour into the church: at the end of the 17th century, King Pedro II, offered a silver crown in the name of the House of Braganza; during the 18th century, King John V donated religious equipment to the chapel; Father Manuel Rodrigues, who died in Castro Daire, left behind 6$000 r√©is in the 18th century; between 1720 and 1730, votive paintings were completed in the altar of the sacristy; and, in October 1752, Ant√≥nio da Fonseca Os√≥rio donate eight pieces of coin, equal to 1$500 r√©is each. In 1722, Father Ant√≥nio Cordeiro died. The chapel was remodeled in 1732, from an inscription on the tomb. On 18 July 1740, King John V elevated the settlement to the status of vila (town). In 1759, the Jesuits abandoned the sanctuary, and the monarch nominated a treasurer to organize and catalogue the contents of the religious buildings and property of the clerics. Ultimately, the Crown took over the lands occupied and rented by the Jesuits. On 4 July 1774, the property of the residence, college of Lamego and the Monastery of Santa Maria de C√°rquere were taken over, and Jo√£o Pinheiro became the caretaker of the financial resources of the institutions. At the same time, the pious legacies, such as perpetual masses, were abolished by the state, underscoring the financial crisis of the time. By the end of the 18th century, the grand sanctuary, was limited to two altars: one dedicated to Saint Joseph and the other to Nossa Senhora da Soledade (Our Lady of Solitude). On 20 December 1793, Queen Maria I donated the sanctuary, its small courtyard, shops and surrounding buildings to the Bishop of Lamego. The bishop immediately ordered Joaquim Santa Rosa de Viterbo, from the Convent of Santo Cristo da Fraga to reinstate classes at the old College, which lasted until 1796, when, for the lack of students, the classes were limited to a basic curriculum. During the 1st half of the 19th century, the nativity was constructed (likely by local clerics). On 5 February 1805, Jos√© de Almeida Vasconcelos Soveral was named the first Viscount of Lapa, which was later transferred to his brother, Manuel de Almeida de Soveral Carvalho e Vasconcelos on 25 February 1813. On 21 August 1822, the first count of Lapa, Manuel de Almeida Vasconcelos de Soveral de Carvalho de Maia Soares de Albergaria was first invested in his title. In 1834, the Government of Portugal transferred the sanctuary, definitively, to the senate of Caria, followed ten years later (1844), with the return of the Church's possessions to the Bishopric of Lamego, by the Court of the Exchequer. This return had the effect of reigniting donatives and decoration in the sanctuary: in 1852, the painter Carlos Augusto Massa, from Cuj√≥, began work on several works, in 1879, the retables were re-gilded (at a cost of 374$520 r√©is); issues with the azulejos, which were in deteriorating conditions, were addressed; and, in 1881, a new image of Saint Anthony was purchased. On 22 July 1884, Jo√£o de Almeida de Ara√∫jo was named by bishop Ant√≥nio da Trindade, to act as primary instructor at the college. By 23 October 1892, the college was reused in order to inaugurate a new seminary, by the bishop. Bishop Ant√≥nio Tom√°s, established a commission on 14 August 1896, consisting of Pl√°cido Augusto de Moura Vasconcelos, canon Jo√£o Teixeira Fafe, canon Manuel Joaquim Mesquita Pimenta and Agostinho Augusto de Oliveira, with the objective of studying the possibility of reconstructing and redecorating the Church. Architect Adolphe Despony was onsite, on 14 September 1904, to study the possibility of constructing a new building. Just after the first lighting system entered the sanctuary (in 1905), the last courses developed by the seminary were being completed (between 1908‚Äì1909). =Republic= On 15 October 1910, the land and buildings were confiscated by the new Republican Government. Through the initiative of Father Francisco Pinto Ferreira, on 22 June 1916, during an easing of tensions between the Church and Republican administration, the Marian Cult, the Congrega√ß√£o das Filhas de Maria (Congregatio of the children of Mary) was established. On 20 February 1923, chandeliers are fixed to the site, produced by a sawmiller from Moimeta mounted by mason Jos√© da Costa. On 14 July 1929, the Ministry of Justice transferred the sanctuary to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lamego. The creation of the brotherhood of the Pia Uni√£o de Nossa Senhora da Lapa (Pious Union of Our Lady of Lapa), on 29 May 1945, helped maintain the devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary: by 1963, there was already 6729 brothers invested in its religious fraternity. This was also followed, after the Carnation Revolution (1975), with the creation of small community of Irm√£s Religiosas da Lapa (Religious Sisters of Lapa), who installed themselves alongside the lookout of Nossa Senhora da Piedade. In 1988, a chapel was transferred to the site, dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi. Through the initiatives of Father Jos√© Alves Amorim, in 1994, the Casa das Novenas was remodelled to sell products typical of the region, while the Casa da Cadeia became a museum (the Museu Monogr√°fico dos Ex-Votos da Lapa) dedicated to celebrating the history of the sanctuary. In addition the old college building and Casa das Novenas were retiled. Architecture The large boulder that shelters the retables of the church and niche dedicated to Our Lady of the Grotto The church/sanctuary is located in an isolated rural environment of Quintela, on the mountain of the same name, over an accented rocky plateau, near the mouth of the Ribeira de Gradiz. The sanctuary is actually erected on a slightly sloping ground, over a large granite pediment. The site includes four rock crosses, referred to as Miradouros which are oriented towards the four cardinal points: the northern cross, called Forca dates to 1672, and is dedicated to Saint James; to the south, is Aguiar da Beira, situated around away, and dedicated to Saint Dominic; in the east, Trancoso dating to 1626; and to the west, Lamego, dedicated to Our Lady of Piety (), situated away, and which includes a pillar surmounted by a niche, with the image of the Virgin Mary. In front of the main facade is a granite cross over a rectangular platform, and two orders of plinths, surmounted by Latin cross. Within the perimeter of the sanctuary is a fountain, called Fonte dos Cl√©rigos (Fountain of the Clergy), dating to 1734, in addition to a 17th-century chapel, moved from Quintela in 1988. =Exterior= The church is an irregular plan, composed of two articulated bodies separated by a walkway, corresponding to the longitudinal church, formed by a single nave, presbytery, with chapel and sacristy along the left lateral facade and annexes opposite them. To the center is a large rock, and the main body of the college, in a simple rectangular design within the main courtyard. The facades are constructed in granite, with simple cornice and eaves. The main facade, oriented towards the west, includes main doorway consisting of Roman arch, with frame surmounted by frieze and double cornice, which is supported by two Corinthian-inspired columns decorated with cherubs, over parallelepiped plinths ornamented with geometric elements. This facade has a triangular pediment with cross on its apex, interrupted by a recessed rectangular window with frame, and flanked by pyramidal pinnacles with spheres, on either corner rooftop. The left-facing wall (towards the north) is marked by annexes, lateral chapel and scaled volumes. On the nave-side, there are two round arched windows with simple frames and rectangular door surmounted by frieze and cornice, while a simple window occupies the presbytery. The lateral chapel includes a similar profile as the other side, but also includes a secondary rectangular window with simple frame along the western extent. The opposite facade includes vestiges of stairs, while the right-facing lateral wall (facing the south) is comparable to the northern facade, with the addition of the sacristy, that includes two rectangular windows flanked by two elliptical oculi. On the annex are three cracks and lintel doorway. The rear of the church includes three covered spaces, corresponding to the church's annexes, which are the largest spaces of the complex, with the rear facade broken by a small niche, surmounted by triangular pediment, while the presbytery gable can be seen from the grounds. Between the presbytery and sacristy is the belltower with Roman arch, decorated with cornices, pinnacles and small belfrey flanked by vanes and cornice, with spire and weathervane. =Interior= The interior is decorated in polychromatic blue and white azulejo tile, with the ceiling covered in wood, divided into panels and reinforced with metal beams, further divided by friezes, cornices and equally-spaced corbels. The pavement consists of slabs of granite, with wood pedestals in lateral areas. The main door is protected by wind-guard and flanked by two stone holy water fonts. Constructed in wood, the high choir is protected by balustrade and accessed by staircase on the left-hand side of the entrance. The lateral retables, painted in beige, blue and brown marble are dedicated to The Death of Saint Joseph (to the left) and Our Lady of Solitude (to the right). To the left of the epistle, the rectangular pulpit sits on a marbled based with a wood guard painted in white, with access achieved through a laterl (left) staircase. The presbytery is on an elevated platform accessed by four central steps, leading to a triumphal archway on tuscan pilasters, surmounted by coat-of-arms. Flanking this archway are the lateral retables at angles, painted beige, blue and gold, dedicated to the Crucifixio (on the left) and Saint Anthony receiving Jesus and Mary (on the right). The main chapel, elevated another three steps, is integrated into a large boulder, with two small retabular structures, dedicated to the Menino Jesus (Baby Jesus) and Senhora da Boa Morte (Our Lady of Good Death), protected by iron grades, an oratory and nativity. Over the boulder is an oratory dedicated to Nossa Senhora das Dores (Our Lady of Sorrows). To the left is a doorway access to the Chapel of the Holy Sacrement, surmounted by a relief coat-of-arms, while flanked by pilasters topped by sculptures of lions is the arcosolium and grave of Pedro do Soveral. Immediately opposite, is the small door to the sacristy, with a staircase access to the belltower. The nativity, inset in the boulder, is protected by glass doors. The small cove with the Sagrada Fam√≠lia and Adoration of the Shepards and central to the diorama, with Gl√≥ria de Anjos and Deus Pai above, while to the left, is the Fuga para o Egipto (Flight to Egypt), while in the upper right is the cortege of the Wise Men, descending.

Osman is also an English surname whose history on English land dates back to the wave of migration that followed the Norman conquest of England of 1066. The Osman family lived in Dorset. Variant spellings of the Osman name include Osment and Osmond. The English surname of Osman should also be pronounced as in Woe not as in Was. Most are of southern England. This interesting surname with variant spellings Osmani, Osmant, Osment, Osmint, Osmer, Usmar comes from the Old English pre 7th Century male personal name Osmaer, \\"oss\\" meaning god and \\"maer\\" fame; hence \\"god-fame\\". The name Osmar and Osmer (without surname) appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, for Leicestershire and Devonshire respectively but the surname doesn't appear until the early part of the 13th Century. On July 15th 1571, Mary Hosmer, daughter of Richard Hosmer, was christened in Brenchley, Kent, and on September 18th 1580, a Jane Hosmer was christened there also. In April 1635, one, James Hosmer, a clothier, aged 28, his wife Ann and two daughters Marie, age 2, and Ann, (3 months) embarked from London on the \\"Elizabeth\\" bound for New England. They were among the earliest recorded name bearers to settle in America. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of William Osmere, which was dated 1230, in the Pipe Rolls of Devonshire, during the reign of King Henry 111, known as \\"The Frenchman\\", 1216 - 1272. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to \\"develop\\" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.

The school used to be located in Klang (1982) and Petaling Jaya (1983‚Äì87), Selangor and named Sekolah Menengah Agama Wilayah Persekutuan, before it moved to Labu in 1987. The school is known as one of the Sekolah Kluster Kecemerlangan (fourth phase) and Sekolah Berprestasi Tinggi (second cohort).  History  SMAP (SMAWP) was founded in January 1982, and was suggested by the director of Islamic Education (Pengarah Pendidikan Islam), Ministry of Education (Malaysia), Tan Sri Datuk Paduka Dr Abdul Hamid Othman. This idea came up with the awareness of the Islamic Religion Council of Wilayah Persekutuan (Majlis Agama Islam Wilayah Persekutuan) on building an Islamic Religious School in Kuala Lumpur. After the suggestion was accepted by the government, the school was named Sekolah Menengah Agama Wilayah Persekutuan (SMAWP). At first, when SMAWP did not own a building, the approximately 500 students (consisted of Form 1, 4, and lower 6 students) were taught at Kolej Islam Klang's building in Selangor. The first generation of the students were taught by 40 teachers, led by the school's first principal, Tuan Hj Muhammad bin Shafie. Following a demonstration by its students in the school compound in Klang as well as at Ministry's office at Lebuh Pasar Besar Kuala Lumpur (making front-page coverage by several print medias), after one year of temporary lodging at KIK (now known as KISAS), in January 1983 SMAWP was relocated to a temporary building in the campus of International Islamic University Malaysia (Universiti Islam Antarabangsa Malaysia), in Section 16, Petaling Jaya. In 1985, Tuan Hj Muhamad Yusof bin Abu Bakar became the next principal and served until the end of 1985. During his time, SMAWP won the 1985 Bahas Bahasa Melayu Piala Perdana Menteri. The next principal, Tuan Hj Muhd Yusof bin Hj Ahmad, continued SMAWP's legacy. At the same time, the Ministry of Education (Malaysia) solved their problem in April 1987 by lending a building in KM 11, Jalan Labu which was supposed to be the place for a 'Maktab Perguruan'. The building was given to the school and was officially opened in July 1989 by Duli Yang Maha Mulia Tuanku Jaafar ibni Almarhum Tuanku Abdul Rahman, the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan at that time. The name SMAWP was later changed to Sekolah Menengah Agama Persekutuan (SMAP) and remains the same until today. A year later, the school members, consisted of 73 teachers and 1000 students, led by the next principal, Tuan Hj Mahmud bin Mohd Rashid, successfully uplifted the school's status and resulted in SMAP being 'adopted' by the International Islamic University Malaysia (Universiti Islam Antarabangsa Malaysia) and Forestry Department (Jabatan Perhutanan). On 16 June 1989, Tuan Hj Abu Bakar bin Lebai Mat came to replace Tuan Hj Mahmud bin Mohd Rashid (who moved to Kuching) as the school's principal. He was responsible for the spearheading of Kegiatan Kumpulan Khidmat Sekolah. After six years of service, he was positioned to be the principal at Maktab Perguruan Islam Bangi and the absence of a principal lasted about nine months. On 17 December 1994, the next principal, Tuan Hj Abdul Rahman bin Halim led the school to its first national record - being the first school in Malaysia to attain 100% of Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia candidates achieving Grade 1 (Gred Satu).

Life She was the second child and first daughter of Claude-Fran√ßois de Cusance (1590‚Äì1627), Baron de Belvoir and de Saint-Julien, an officer in the Spanish Netherlands, and of Ernestine van Witthem (before 1588‚Äì1649), Comtesse de Walhain and Vicomtesse de S√©bourg. She was raised in Besan√ßon and at the Brussels court of Isabella Clara Eugenia, regent of the Spanish Netherlands. She inherited Belvoir and Saint-Julien after the death of her brother Cleriadus de Cusance in 1635. In 1634, she became the mistress of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who was at the time in the service of Spain. To avoid a scandal, her mother arranged a marriage to Leopold-Eug√®ne Perrenot de Granvelle, Prince de Cantecroix (1615‚Äì1637), whom she married in 1635. On 9 April 1637, nine days after the death of her first husband, a marriage contract with Charles IV was signed. Six months after the ceremony she gave birth to a boy, whom Charles acknowledged. The boy, Joseph, died in February 1638.

The couple separated in April 1642 following his excommunication, which was the consequence of his second marriage; earlier, in 1639, B√©atrix gave birth to a girl named Anne, whom Charles recognized. Although the excommunication was lifted in 1645, the couple was ordered to remain separated until the matter was solved by the Catholic church. B√©atrix lived in Brussels, where she hosted a salon and arranged concerts as one of the city's leading social figures. In 1652 she became acquainted with Constantijn Huygens, who dedicated to her some of his work and with whom she corresponded.http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/briefwisselingconstantijnhuygens/brieven?zk_correspondentid=845 In 1652‚Äì1660, she lived in several places in the Spanish Netherlands.

When he returned to Lorraine in 1659, B√©atrix left the Netherlands to join him. However, he did not wish to see her and they did not resume their relationship. More than 20 years after their separation, on 20 May 1663, Charles married B√©atrix de Cusance a second time, to allow legitimation of their children. She died two weeks after this second marriage. Charles married a fourth time at the age of 61.

William Harvey was his coach. He also ran in the Marathon trials in 1976. He continued to do marathons and in 1985 finished second in the Boston Marathon behind England's Geoff Smith's repeat victory. It was kind of unexpected for the 37-year-old accompanying his future wife, Ruth Vomund to her first visit to the event. One key or result from Tuttle's success is he possessed one of the highest VO2 max capabilities recorded. After a career of Marathons, Tuttle has come to realize that the marathon distance is not his best, pointing to his lifetime personal record in the 10,000 metres of 28:26 as indicating he should have been able to run a marathon six minutes faster. Feeling like a bullet-proof long distance runner, Tuttle found his undoing in attempting a remarkable stunt‚Äîrunning his age on his birthday. When he turned 39, he ran 39 miles. While he successfully negotiated that ordeal, without taking time off, he continued to train as he had for the last two decades. He injured his hamstrings to the point that he was never able to run without pain, though he has continued to run sporadically into his 60s. Businessman For three decades (1976 to 2007), Tuttle owned the Inside Track Running Store in Ventura, creating and coaching the Team Inside Track team of local community runners. The best of those runner, the TIT Racing Team, included Vomund and eventual CIF California State Meet champion Josh Spiker, who would buy the store from Tuttle in 2007. During this period, Tuttle was instrumental in the organization of several dozen races every year and worked as a starter or official for dozens more. Political office Tuttle was part of a pro- environmental wave of candidates that won seats on the Ventura City Council in 1989. He was re-elected in 1993 against a wave of pro-growth candidates, rising to the position of Deputy Mayor. In frustration with the direction of the council, Tuttle chose not to seek a third term. Tuttle is now active as a leader in the Ventura County Democratic Party. In 1989, Tuttle was elected into the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame.

It is a well-studied invertebrate, which has been cultured for use in laboratories for over 30 years. C. teleta is the first marine polychaete to have its genome sequenced.  Description  = Initial discovery = For many years researchers believed that Capitella capitata was the only representative of this genus that survived, and flourished, in polluted environments. After the oil spill that occurred near Cape Cod in West Falmouth, Massachusetts in 1969, researchers collected sediment and found an abundance of what they believed to be C. capitata. However, subsequent research showed that while the individuals collected from that region had very similar gross morphology, their life histories, methods of reproduction and genetics indicated there were at least six distinct species. Capitella species I, eventually described as Capitella teleta in 2009, was one of the initial species identified from these surveys. = Etymology = After 30 years of research on the group, Capitella teleta was officially described in 2009 by Blake et al. The species name is derived from the Greek word teleta, meaning \\"initiation\\". This word symbolizes that it was the first alternative Capitella species that was identified. = Phylogenetics = A 2018 molecular phylogeny of the family Capitellidae established clear monophyly and showed 8 genera. The phylogeny utilized 36 capitellid species and combined data from 18S, 28S, H3, and COI gene sequences. This study also established Capitellidae as the sister group to Echiura. While the study attempted to map morphological characters to the molecular phylogeny, this was not phylogenetically informative and a more detailed re-evaluation of morphology could help to elucidate character trait evolution. = Taxonomic morphology = C. teleta has a narrow, segmented body with reduced parapodia and is red in color. There are nine anterior thoracic segments and many more abdominal segments. New segments are added throughout the lifespan from a posterior subterminal growth zone, called the posterior growth zone. Like other polychaetes, C. teleta has fine bristles or setae. Setae are segmentally repeated along the body, with morphologically distinct setae in the thoracic (hooded hooks) and abdominal segments (capillary setae). This animal exhibits sexual dimorphism and males have dorsally-positioned genital spines on setigers 8-9 while females have paired ovaries in the abdominal segments.Eckelbarger KJ, Grassle JP: Ultrastructural differences in the eggs and ovarian follicle cells of the Capitella (Polychaeta) sibling species. Biol Bull 1983, 165:379-393. Generally, there are separate sexes, however, hermaphroditism is possible when there are low densities of females. Males, females and hermaphrodites are of similar size (max size collected was a male that is 24 mm in length).  Ecology  = Habitat = Capitella teleta lives in the shallow-water or intertidal marine environment. It is also found in salt marshes and is often found in high concentrations in disturbed soft sediments. It is a member of the infaunal benthic community. C. teleta burrows through the sediment by peristalsis, using its hydrostatic skeleton and contraction of longitudinal and circular muscles in the body wall. The thoracic segments of C. teleta also contain helical muscles that are proposed to generate additional force for burrowing. Capitellids are commonly thought of as opportunistic in nature, due to their ability to inhabit and flourish in organically enriched marine sediments. This organism is commonly found in sediments along the east and west coasts of North America. Additional reports have placed this group in the Mediterranean region as well as Japan. Brood tube = Life history = C. teleta embryos and early larval stages develop in a brood tube that surrounds the mother. The embryos are approximately 200 ¬µm in diameter. Over the course of approximately a week, the embryos develop into non-feeding larvae which form musculature, a centralized nervous system, two circular ciliary bands, two eye spots, segments, and setae. The larvae are non-feeding and the digestive system develops at a later stage than other organs. Pre- metamorphosis larvae can be categorized into nine stages, with each stage lasting approximately one day. Upon further body elongation and gut maturation, the larvae emerge from the brood tube, and swim forward with a rotational turn via the beating of cilia organized within two circular bands, the prototroch and telotroch. Larvae exhibit positive phototactic behavior in which they swim towards light, potentially an adaptation to aid in larval dispersal C. teleta is an indirect developer and undergoes metamorphosis from a swimming larva into a burrowing juvenile. Metamorphosis is characterized by cilia loss, body elongation, and crawling behavior. Marine sediment functions as a cue to initiate metamorphosis into juvenile worms that thereafter grow into mature adults. Competent larvae can be induced to metamorphose into juveniles when exposed to the B vitamins Nicotinamide (B3) and Riboflavin (B2), suggesting that these chemical compounds may be responsible for the inductive role of the marine sediment in larval metamorphosis. The number of offspring in each brood tube can vary between 50 - 400 individuals, and is influenced by food quality. After metamorphosis, the juveniles begin burrowing and feeding. The juvenile worms continue to grow and add segments during the eight weeks it takes to become sexually mature adults. Males and females can reproduce multiple times during their lifetime. Adults live approximately 12‚Äì14 weeks after maturation. Stages of Capitella teleta larval development (Seaver et al., 2005) = Feeding = Capitella teleta feeds on the enriched sediment in which it burrows. C. teleta has a complex, regionalized alimentary canal consisting of a foregut, midgut and hindgut. It ingests the sediment by everting its proboscis, which contains a ciliated, muscular dorsal pharynx. Presence of a dorsal pharynx is uncommon in marine polychaetes, and this adaptation may have evolved independently in the family Capitellidae through selective pressures on feeding mode in the benthic marine niche they occupy.  Research  Stage 9 larvae A wide range of techniques have been developed to investigate C. teleta developmental processes. In 2006, the first study using whole mount in situ hybridization was published. This technique allows investigation of the expression and localization of specific mRNAs within a fixed sample. Immunohistochemistry was later developed as a way to visualize specific cell types in fixed specimens. A microinjection protocol for uncleaved embryos and early cleavage stages was developed in 2010 and was used in a fate mapping study to investigate the ultimate fate of blastomeres. Other useful techniques for studying early development of the embryo are targeted deletion of single cells with an infrared laser and blastomere isolation experiments. Laser deletion was also utilized for the deletion of larval eyes at a later stage in development. The development of microinjection techniques allowed for introduction of different nucleic acid constructs that can be injected into an uncleaved zygote. This includes use of gene perturbation techniques such as Morpholino knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, and methods for living imaging such as mRNA injection. The development of each technique opens doors for new avenues of inquiry and experimentation and expands the number and complexity of questions C. teleta researchers can thoroughly investigate. =Embryogenesis= Like many species within Spiralia, C. teleta embryogenesis follows an unequal spiral cleavage program where blastomeres are born according to a predictable order, size and position. This shared stereotypic cleavage program allows for the identification of individual cells and there is a standard cell-nomenclature system. Additionally, individual cells can be microinjected with fluorescent dyes and their descendants tracked to determine the lineage of particular tissues and larval structures. Through this method, a comprehensive fate map was created for C. teleta. In general, there is substantial similarity of cell fates between C. teleta and other Spiralia. For instance, in C. teleta and several other spiralians, cells derived from the A, B, C, and D embryo quadrants respectively give rise to the left, ventral, right, and dorsal portions of the larval body. However, the origin of mesoderm differs across species. In C. teleta, mesoderm is generated from cells called 3c and 3d that are derived from both the C and D embryo quadrants, but in the annelid Platynereis dumerilii and in several mollusks, trunk mesoderm is generated from a single cell 4d. The establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis during early embryological development has also been extensively studied in C. teleta. It is reported that micromere 2d, a cell that is born when the embryo has 16 cells, has organizing activity which enables it to induce dorsal-ventral polarity within the embryo. Fate map studies have demonstrated that cell 2d gives rise to ectoderm in the larval trunk and pygidium in C. teleta, while descendants of the first quartet micromeres give rise to structures in the larval head. When micromere 2d is laser ablated, 2d derived structures as well as dorsal-ventral organization in the head is lost. This suggests a requirement for 2d to be present in order to induce the proper formation of the head along a dorsal-ventral axis. When micromeres 2d1 and 2d2, the immediate descendants of 2d, are both deleted, the resulting larvae retain dorsal-ventral organization within the head. It was therefore concluded that in C. teleta micromere 2d has organizing activity in patterning the dorsal- ventral body axis. Furthermore, perturbation studies have shown that the dorsal-ventral axis is primarily patterned via the Activin/Nodal pathway. =Regeneration= Many annelids possess the capability to regenerate their anterior, posterior, or both ends of their body. C. teleta is capable of posterior regeneration. Both juveniles and adults can regenerate their posterior halves quite well. A staging system has been established, describing the sequential regeneration events in juveniles of C. teleta.name=\\":22\\"> The first stage of regeneration encompasses the first 24 hours following amputation or injury. This stage is marked by wound healing and a change in cell proliferation patterns. Wound healing occurs within 4‚Äì6 hours of amputation, as the circular muscles in the body wall contract, bringing the epithelium together to cover the wound. During this time, cell proliferation patterns are different from uncut animals; while cell proliferation is still observed throughout the body, there is a marked reduction at the wound site. In stage II, approximately 2 days after amputation, a small blastema forms that contains proliferating cells, and there is a diffuse network of neurites extending from the old ventral nerve cord tissue into the blastema. In stage III, approximately 3 days after amputation, the blastema becomes more organized as proliferating cells pack closely together in the newly formed tissue and multiple neurites condense into nerves. In stage IV, 5 days after amputation, there continues to be an increase in cell proliferation, but less so in the new tissue. The neural projections into the blastema become even more organized and patterned. Additionally, the posterior growth zone, pygidium, and hindgut reform. Finally, Stage 5 is marked by the presence and continued addition of new segments with differentiated tissues and ganglia. The entire regeneration process in C. teleta adults is completed within about two weeks The rate of regeneration can vary among individuals, especially pertaining to health and nutrition intake. Hox genes, patterning genes that regulate segment identity during development in many animals, and are expressed in the blastema of C. teleta during posterior regeneration. This suggests a role in the regeneration process, but the exact expression patterns do not make an obvious link to establishment of segment identity in newly formed tissue during regeneration. The shift in Hox gene expression in the blastema during posterior regeneration is indicative of limited morphallaxis, in addition to epimorphic regeneration The regeneration of the germline in embryos has also been investigated. In early stage embryos, the germline precursor (cell 3D) was deleted using an infrared laser. 13% of screened larvae showed presence of multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs), indicating some regeneration of the germline. Furthermore, all juveniles two weeks post- metamorphosis have MPCs. Finally, almost all adult worms raised from treated embryos developed functional reproductive systems and produced offspring that developed into swimming larvae. = Toxicology = Capitella teleta is an indicator species for environments contaminated with organic pollution. C. teleta has the ability to colonize these habitats rapidly with high growth rates. These characteristics have led to their use in various toxicological studies. Their population and/or individual- level responses to pollutant exposures have been investigated in various toxicants such as synthetic musk, acetyl cedrene, fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, fluoxetine, cadmium, copper oxide nanoparticles, and silver nanoparticles. Recently, the effects of the fluoranthene-spiked sediments on the gut microbiome were investigated and several taxa of bacteria were identified; these taxa may play a role in the metabolism of fluoranthene.  Genome  The genome of Capitella teleta was sequenced in concert with the owl limpet, Lottia gigantean, and the freshwater leech, Helobdella robusta, by the Joint Genome Institute in 2013. This was the first attempt at sequencing a marine polychaete and the sequencing and study of these three spiralian genomes provided an important perspective of early bilaterian evolutionary processes. Additionally, this work showed strong support for the monophyletic grouping of Lophotrochozoa. The researchers found that when compared to other animal genomes, all three organisms possessed genome organization, gene structure and functional content that was more closely related to invertebrate deuterostome genomes than those of fellow invertebrate protostomes. C. teleta possesses a highly conserved and slowly evolving genome with respect to other metazoans. Karyotype analysis revealed that C. teleta has 10 pairs of chromosomes.

It was the only state belonging to the Poona Agency under the Bombay Presidency, which became later part of the Deccan States Agency. Along with Akkalkot State, Aundh State, Phaltan State and Jath State, it was one of the Satara Jagirs. Situated among the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats, the state covered an area of 2,396 square kilometres, and had a population of 137,268 in 1901.Bhor Princely State (9 gun salute) The town of Bhor, once the capital of the princely state, is located about 51 kilometres south of Pune, adjacent to Bhatghar Dam. The royal palace is still present. Also present in the vicinity is the temple of Bhoreshwar, dedicated to Lord Shiva. A temple dedicated to goddesses Janubai and Khiloba is located in Mhalawadi, a village close to the Bhatghar Dam.  History  The Jagir (fiefdom), which was the forerunner of the state, was granted to Shankarji Narayan for his services as the Pant Sachiv, one of the eight hereditary Maratha ministers, by Rajaram Chhatrapati in 1697.The jagir remained part of the Maratha empire until the 1818 when Peshwa rule came to an end. The jagir then became part of the shortly lived Satara state with an agreement signed with the British East India Company in 1820. In 1838-39,the state experienced uprising by the Ramoshi against the British.It is believed that personalities associated with the deposed Bajirao II instigated the troubles. The ruling family of Bhor were Hindus of the Deshastha Brahmin caste. They continued using the Maratha title Pant Sachiv, only later assuming the royal style of Raja, and were entitled, under British rule, to a hereditary 9-gun salute. The Family deity of the rulers was the goddess Bhorai whose temple is located on Sudhagad. The state also controlled other historic forts such as Rajgad, Rohida and Sarasgad.

On 11 Squadron aircraft the \\"Sioux\\" was surrounded by a red circle.Blasons Familiers, p. 130 The squadron motto was \\"Tenacity\\". = Second World War = Just before the outbreak of World War II, 11 Squadron was assigned to 6th Group under command of Commander Dumonceau, while 9 Squadron remained in the 5th Group. To improve mobility and the possibility of deployed operations, each group comprised a maintenance squadron, a field train of about 25 vehicles, and an anti-aircraft unit of 40mm Bofors guns. Commanded by Captain Henri de la Lindi, 11 Squadron took an active part in the 18 days campaign. On the morning of the May 10, 11 Squadron rejoined its diversion airfield at Hannut, few hours before Bierset was bombarded by Dornier 17's of the Luftwaffe. 11 Squadron was one of three squadrons that continued to fight until the surrender on May 28, 1940. Both \\"Sioux\\" squadrons (9 and 11) combined executed 54 combat missions, for a loss of three pilots and 11 aircraft.Sous nos Ailes, p.139 = Cold War = After World War II, 11 Squadron was resurrected as a night fighter squadron of 1st Fighter Wing at Beauvechain Air Base on April 25, 1951. It was equipped with de Havilland Mosquito NFXXXs, and the squadron insignia was a grey bat on a yellow triangle. As from the summer of 1952, it entered the jet age by slowly transforming to Gloster Meteor NFXI. The squadron only gained operational status on that type on September 10, 1956. On December 17, 1957, 11 Squadron received as first non-Canadian squadron, its initial batch of CF-100 Canuck. It was disbanded again at Beauvechain on November 3, 1960.Bat Squadron Story p. 14, 20-22  Training squadron  = Sint Truiden = In 1971, a thorough revision of the Air Force training system called for the creation of new training squadrons. Re-created on May 14, 11 Squadron became part of the ‚ÄúPerfectioning Center‚Äù at Brustem (Sint Truiden), together with 7 and 9 Squadrons. Its initial mission was to provide Instrument Flight Training to the student pilots on Lockheed T-33. This aircraft was to be retired from service on August 23, 1979. The first delivery of its successor, the Dassault Alpha-Jet took place on December 7, 1978, and as of 1979 the students started training on this aircraft. The mission of 11 Squadron was now to provide Initial Operational Training (IOT), combining simulated air-to-air combat and air-to-ground tactics. 11 Squadron continued to be based at Brustem until the move to Beauvechain.Bat Squadron Story p.25, 34 = Beauvechain = On November 19, 1996, all training units were moved to Beauvechain, a former air defense base, to become 1st Wing. A few years later, in 2000, the Alpha-Jet received an extensive avionics update. The Inertial Reference System updated by GPS, combined with a Head-up display provided the possibility to simulate tactics used on the F-16. On August 30, 2001, a further re-organisation of the training squadrons lead to an expansion of 11 Squadron's mission. It took over the Advanced Flying Training (AFT) from 7 Squadron. During the AFT, students having finished on the SF260 took their first steps on a jet aircraft, and graduated as pilots after succeeding. Afterwards, they stayed in 11 Squadron to complete the IOT. =Cazaux= In the scope of a European training programme, the Advanced Jet Training School (AJeTS), 11 Squadron moved to Base A√©rienne 120 at Cazaux in France on September 14, 2005.Het Belang van Limburg Luchtmachtbasis Bevekom wuift de Alpha-Jet uit 14/09/05 Transfer of the aircraft had begun as from 2004.

It was under the central division of the Bombay Presidency, under the states of the Kolhapur-Deccan Residency, Satara Agency, and later the Deccan States Agency. Its capitan was Phaltan town, located in present-day Maharashtra. It had been one of the Satara Jagirs, which included Bhor, Aundh, Phaltan, Jath, Daphlapur and Akalkot. Its Flag was a rectangular bicolor, orange over green. Geography The state measured 397 square miles (1,028 km¬≤) in area. According to the 1901 census, the population showed a decrease of 31% in the decade at 45,739. The population of the town itself was 9,512 in that year.

By G√°bor √Ågoston, Bruce Alan Masters The offshore island fortresses of Souda, Grambousa, and Spinalonga would remain under Venetian rule until in 1715, when they too were captured by the Ottomans. Crete took part in the Greek War of Independence, but the local uprising was suppressed with the aid of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. The island remained under Egyptian control until 1840, when it was restored to full Ottoman authority. Following the Cretan Revolt (1866‚Äì1869) and especially the Pact of Halepa in 1878, the island received significant autonomy, but Ottoman violations of the autonomy statutes and Cretan aspirations for eventual union with the Kingdom of Greece led to the Cretan Revolt of 1897‚Äì98 and the Greco- Turkish War (1897). Despite an Ottoman victory in the war, Crete became an autonomous state in 1898 because of intervention in favor of Greece by European powers and was united with Greece after the Balkan Wars. History During the Cretan War (1645‚Äì1669), Venice was pushed out of Crete by the Ottoman Empire. Most of the island fell in the first years of the war, but the capital Candia (Heraklion) held out during a long siege which lasted from 1648 to 1669, possibly the longest siege in history. The last Venetian outposts, the island fortresses of Souda, Gramvousa and Spinalonga, fell in the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War of 1714‚Äì1718. =Rebellions against Ottoman rule= There were significant rebellions against Ottoman rule, particularly in Sfakia. Daskalogiannis was a famous rebel leader. who in 1770 led a heroic but foredoomed revolt, which did not get the aid from the Russians who instigated it (see Orlov Revolt). The Greek War of Independence began in 1821 and Cretan participation was extensive. An uprising by Christians met with a fierce response from the Ottoman authorities and the execution of several bishops, regarded as ringleaders. Between 1821 and 1828, the island was the scene of repeated hostilities. The Muslims were driven into the large fortified towns on the north coast and it would appear that as many as 60% of them died from plague or famine while there. The Cretan Christians also suffered severely, losing around 21% of their population. During the great massacre of Heraklion on 24 June 1821, remembered in the area as \\"the great ravage\\" (\\"Œø ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒøœÇ Œ±œÅœÄŒµŒΩœÑŒ≠œÇ\\", \\"o megalos arpentes\\"), the Turks also killed the metropolite of Crete, Gerasimos Pardalis, and five more bishops.Dr. Detorakis, Theocharis \\"Brief Historical Review of the Holy Archdiocese of Crete\\" As the Ottoman Sultan, Mahmud II, had no army of his own available, he was forced to seek the aid of his rebellious vassal and rival, Muhammad Ali of Egypt, who sent an expedition to the island. In 1825 Muhammad Ali's son, Ibrahim, landed in Crete and began to massacre the majority Greek community.Peacock, A History of Modern Europe, p. 220 Britain decided that Crete should not become part of the new Kingdom of Greece on its independence in 1830, evidently fearing that it would either become a centre of piracy as it had often been in the past, or a Russian naval base in the East Mediterranean. Rather than being included in the new Greek state, Crete was administered by an Albanian from Egypt, Mustafa Naili Pasha (known as Mustafa Pasha), whose rule attempted to create a synthesis of Muslim landowners and the emergent Christian commercial classes. Though subsequent Greek nationalist historiography has portrayed the Pasha as an oppressive figure, as reported by British and French consular observers, he seems to have been generally cautious, pro-British, and to have tried harder to win the support of the Cretan Christians (having married the daughter of a priest and allowed her to remain Christian) than the Cretan Muslims. In 1834, however, a Cretan committee was set up in Athens to work for the union of the island with Greece. In 1840, Egypt was forced by Palmerston to return Crete to direct Ottoman rule. Mustafa Pasha angled unsuccessfully to become semi- independent Prince of Greece but the Christian Cretans instead of supporting rose up against him, once more driving the Muslims temporarily into siege in the towns. An Anglo-Ottoman naval operation restored control in the island and Mustafa Pasha was confirmed as the governor of the island, though under command from Constantinople. He remained there until 1851 when he was summoned to Constantinople, where though of relatively advanced age (his early fifties) he had a successful career, becoming Grand Vizier several times. After Greece achieved its independence, Crete became an object of contention as the Christian part of its population revolted several times against Ottoman rule. Revolts in 1841 and 1858 secured some privileges, such as the right to bear arms, equality of Christian and Muslim worship, and the establishment of Christian councils of elders with jurisdiction over education and customary law. Despite these concessions, the Christian Cretans maintained their ultimate aim of union with Greece, and tensions between the Christian and Muslim communities ran high. Thus, in 1866 the great Cretan Revolt began. The uprising, which lasted for three years, involved volunteers from Greece and other European countries, where it was viewed with considerable sympathy. Despite early successes of the rebels, who quickly confined the Ottomans to the northern towns, the uprising failed. The Ottoman Grand Vizier A'ali Pasha personally assumed control of the Ottoman forces and launched a methodical campaign to retake the rural districts, which was combined with promises of political concessions, notably by the introduction of an Organic Law, which gave the Cretan Christians equal (in practice, because of their superior numbers, majority) control of local administration. His approach bore fruits, as the rebel leaders gradually submitted. By early 1869, the island was again under Ottoman control. The island was made a vilayet with a special status with a firman dated 18 September 1867. During the Congress of Berlin in the summer of 1878, there was a further rebellion, which was halted quickly by the intervention of the British and the adaptation of the 1867-8 Organic Law into a constitutional settlement known as the Pact of Halepa. Crete became a semi- independent parliamentary state within the Ottoman Empire under an Ottoman Governor who had to be a Christian. A number of the senior \\"Christian Pashas\\" including Photiades Pasha and Kostis Adosidis Pasha ruled the island in the 1880s, presiding over a parliament in which liberals and conservatives contended for power. Disputes between the two powers however led to a further insurgency in 1889 and the collapse of the Pact of Halepa arrangements. The international powers, disgusted at what seemed to be factional politics, allowed the Ottoman authorities to send troops to the island and restore order but did not anticipate that Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II would use this as a pretext to end the Halepa Pact Constitution and instead rule the island by martial-law. This action led to international sympathy for the Cretan Christians and to a loss of any remaining acquiescence among them for continued Ottoman rule. When a small insurgency began in September 1895, it spread quickly, and by the summer of 1896 the Ottoman forces had lost military control of most of the island. The new uprising led to the dispatch of a Greek expeditionary force to the island, culminating in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, in which Greece suffered a heavy defeat. The Great Powers dispatched a multinational naval force, the International Squadron, to Crete in February 1897, and it forced the Greek Army to abandon the island. It also bombarded Cretan insurgent forces, placed sailors and marines ashore, and instituted a blockade of Crete and key ports in Greece, bringing organized combat on the island to an end by late March 1897.McTiernan, pp. 13-23. Meanwhile, the International Squadron's senior admirals formed an \\"Admirals Council\\" that temporarily governed Crete pending a resolution of the Cretan uprising, and the Admirals Council eventually decided that Crete should become an autonomous state within the Ottoman Empire.McTiernan, p. 28. The International Squadron forced the Ottoman troops to depart Crete as well in November 1898. Rural Turks and Bashibazuks (irregular Turkish troops), goaded by the appointment of Stylianos M. Alexiou as the first Christian director of the Revenue Service, on 6 September 1898 (25 August 1898 according to the Julian calendar then in use on Crete, which was 12 days behind the modern Gregorian calendar during the 19th century), as the new clerks were on their way to start work in the town customs house, attacked them and the British detachment escorting them. A Turkish mob rapidly spread throughout the town, as Cretan Greek houses and shops were pillaged and buildings were torched, particularly in the area then known as Vezir √áar≈üƒ±, the modern-day 25 August Street. Around 700 Cretan Greeks, 17 British soldiers, and the British Consul in Crete were killed. The Great Powers ordered the rapid trial and execution of the Muslim Cretan ringleaders of the riots. In the wake of this massacre, the Great Powers decided that all Ottoman influence on Crete had to cease. On 6 November 1898, under the orders of the Powers, the last Ottoman troops withdrew from the island, marking the end of 253 years of Ottoman rule.Kitromilides M. Paschalis (ed) Eleftherios Venizelos: The Trials of Statesmanship, Edinburgh University Press, 2008 p. 68 The Cretan State, autonomous but under the suzerainty of the Sultan and under international occupation, was established upon the arrival of its first High Commissioner, Prince George of Greece and Denmark, on 21 December 1898 (9 December according to the Julian calendar).Enosis: The Union of Crete with Greece McTiernan, pp. 35-39.

Hayden, The Settlement History of the Vrokastro Area and Related Studies, vol. 2 of Reports on the Vrokastro Area, Eastern Crete, p. 299 After the Ottoman conquest of 1669, a sizeable proportion of the population gradually converted to Islam. According to 17th century British diplomat Paul Rycaut, the orthodox population welcomed Ottomans as liberators from the \\"oppressive rule of Roman Catholic Italians\\" and \\"began to undergo conversion to Islam in substantial numbers\\". Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the Greek War of Independence as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim.Excerpts from William Yale, The Near East: A modern history by (Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan Press, 1958) A small number of these were crypto-Christians who converted back to Christianity; others fled Crete because of the unrest. By the last Ottoman census in 1881, Christians were 76% of the population, and Muslims (usually called \\"Turks\\" regardless of language, culture, and ancestry) only 24%, but Muslims were over 60% in the three large towns on the north coast and Monofatsi. Christians were 93% of the population in 1923 of the districts of Crete. The remaining Muslims were forced to leave for Turkey in the population exchange by religion between Greece and Turkey.A.

According to the four-document hypothesis, Luke combined Mark, the Q source, and L to produce his gospel. The material in L, like that in M, probably comes from the oral tradition.

Sangli State was one of the 11-gun salute Maratha princely states of British India. It was under the Kolhapur- Dekkan Residency in the Bombay Presidency, and later the Deccan States Agency. The Principality of Sangli covered an area of 2,880 square kilometers and had a population of 226,128 in 1901, while the population of the town itself was 16,829 in that year. The capital of the state was Sangli. The city derives its name from \\"Saha Galli\\" (\\"Six Lanes\\" in Marathi). History Sangli was part of Maratha Empire, for it had been one of the Southern Maratha Jagirs. However, there are no direct references mentioning Sangli before 1801. During the time of Chhatrapati Shivaji, Sangli, Miraj and surrounding areas were captured from the Mughal Empire. Until 1801, Sangli was included in the Miraj Jagir. The First Chintamanrao Appasaheb Patwardhan established a different principality with Sangli as the capital city. On 5 May 1819 Sangli State became a British protectorate. Its territory was widely scattered among other native states and British districts. The last ruler of Sangli was Capt. HH Shrimant Raja Saheb Sir Chintamanrao II Dhundirajrao Appasaheb Patwardhan.

Many common integral transforms used in signal processing have their discrete counterparts. For example, for the Fourier transform the counterpart is the discrete Fourier transform. In addition to spectral analysis of signals, discrete transforms play important role in data compression, signal detection, digital filtering and correlation analysis. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is the most widely used transform coding compression algorithm in digital media, followed by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Transforms between a discrete domain and a continuous domain are not discrete transforms. For example, the discrete-time Fourier transform and the Z-transform, from discrete time to continuous frequency, and the Fourier series, from continuous time to discrete frequency, are outside the class of discrete transforms. Classical signal processing deals with one-dimensional discrete transforms. Other application areas, such as image processing, computer vision, high definition television, visual telephony, etc. make use of two-dimensional and in general, multidimensional discrete transforms.

The fourth named storm of the 2007‚Äì08 Australian region cyclone season, Helen developed out of a weak area of low pressure in late December over the Top End region of Australia. Generally tracking westward, the system eventually intensified into a tropical cyclone and was given the name Helen on 2 January. By this time, it was situated over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf and was beginning to retrograde eastward. Late on 4 January, the storm made landfall near Channel Point with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) though rapidly weakened to a tropical low within 12 hours. Gradually accelerating, the remnants of Helen moved over the Gulf of Carpentaria before striking land again on 6 January. The system was last noted over the Cape York Peninsula on 7 January. From late December through 6 January, Helen and its precursor low produced significant rainfall over the Northern Territory, generally amounting between . One person drowned in the Victoria River after his car was swept away in a flood. As a tropical cyclone, Helen produced significant wind gusts across the Top End, peaking at 120 km/h (75 mph), downing thousands of trees. In Darwin, roughly 15,000 people were without power due to the storm, more than 100 of which remained so four days after the storm. Overall losses from the storm reached A$1.3 million (US$1.1 million) with an additional A$1 million (US$882,000) in cleanup costs. Meteorological history As early as autumn 2007, long-range forecast models indicated that a La Ni√±a would develop by December of that year. In general, this event results in increased sea surface temperatures near Australia. Following this, a strong Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation phase took shape, leading to the development of Tropical Cyclone Melanie off the coast of Western Australia and an area of low pressure over the Top End by 28 December. Situated over land, the system initially embedded within a disorganised trough and to intensify as it slowly tracked eastward. By 30 December, it separated itself from the trough and travelled towards the west. The following day, the interaction between the two systems allowed the low to significantly deepen, attaining a barometric pressure of 993 mbar (hPa; 29.32 inHg). This strengthening was short-lived as wind shear over the low increased, displacing convection from its centre. By 2 January, the weak low moved over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf where it slowly developed over the following day. Once over water, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Depression 09S. As organisation improved, a mid-level subtropical ridge over Western Australia pushed the system westward, away from the Kimberley coast. Steadily strengthening, the low attained gale-force winds near its centre during the morning of 4 January and was subsequently named Helen by the Bureau of Meteorology. Shortly thereafter, a strong westerly monsoon flow to the north caused Helen to turn eastward, back towards land. Intensification continued up until landfall, by which time Helen had attained Category 2 status on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Maximum ten-minute sustained winds reached 95 km/h (60 mph) and the storm's barometric pressure decreased to 975 mbar (hPa; 28.79 inHg). The JTWC assessed Helen to have been slightly weaker, with peak winds estimated at 85 km/h (50 mph). Around 10:00 pm local time on 4 January, the centre of Tropical Cyclone Helen made landfall near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once overland and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12 hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5 January. Due to an increase in forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once overland again, the remnants of Helen abruptly slowed and were last noted on 7 January in the same region. Preparations Trees and power lines downed in Darwin as a result of Cyclone Helen Starting in late December, widespread rains produced by the precursor to Helen prompted the issuance of flood warnings throughout the Top End region. Prior to the arrival of Cyclone Helen on 4 January, the Bureau of Meteorology issued cyclone warnings for areas between the Mitchell Plateau, in Western Australia, to Cape Hotham in the Northern Territory. According to local officials, flooding was the greatest concern from the storm rather than wind damage. The warning area was later condensed to encompass areas from Wadeye to Cape Hotham, including Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. By 6 January, warnings were issued for the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula between Karumba and Weipa as the remnants of Helen were forecast to regain storm intensity. In light of Helen's approach in the Top End region, the Compass Resources mining company suspended construction of a new mine in Batchelor. Mining at the Ranger Uranium Mine maintained by Energy Resources of Australia was also suspended until the storm passed. The George Brown Darwin Botanic Gardens and Territory Wildlife Park were also closed for the duration of the storm. Residents in the Aboriginal community of Wadeye were strongly advised to take precautions for the storm. Following the issuance of a cyclone warning in Darwin, local shelters were opened to the public. At the Darwin International Airport, all incoming and outgoing flights through Jetstar Airways were cancelled while Tiger Airways rescheduled their flights and no changes were made by Qantas. Darwin Harbour was mostly shut down as seas became too rough to sail in. Schools and day cares within a radius of the city were closed on 4 January. Impact and aftermath Power crews clearing trees and fixing downed wires in the wake of Cyclone Helen Throughout the Top End region, the precursor to Helen resulted in a prolonged period of moderate rains over a relatively large area. These rains caused the Victoria River to swell over its banks and flood nearby areas. On 4 January, a car with three people was swept away by the river; two of the passengers managed to escape and swim to shore, but the third person remained trapped. Aerial searches were made later that day for him, though he was later declared dead. After becoming a tropical cyclone, the storm produced additional moderate to heavy rainfall, generally totaling between . Between 1 and 6 January, a total of of rain fell in Darwin. These rains affected two additional major rivers in the area: the Adelaide and Katherine rivers. Near where the storm made landfall, wind gusts up to 120 km/h (75 mph) were recorded; Darwin recorded a maximum wind gust of as Helen moved by the city. Near Channel Point, the cyclone brought a storm surge of , barely surpassing the highest astronomical tide in a few areas. In some cases, waves over topped sand dunes but no damage took place. Roughly 10-15% of trees in open areas were snapped or uprooted by high winds. Only two structures sustained direct wind damage while several others were struck by downed trees. Damage was more widespread in Darwin where roughly 15,000 homes, 60% of the city's residences, were left without power. Approximately 1,500 trees were downed in the city, falling on roads, homes and power lines. In the days following the storm's passage, the Adelaide and Katherine rivers continued to rise, of which the former exceeded minor flood levels. In the harbour, seven vessels washed ashore, each sustaining minor damage. Losses caused by the storm was placed at A$1.3 million (US$1.1 million). The day after Helen passed through, cleanup efforts began as power crews had to remove downed trees before fixing power lines. The main power lines in the city were restored within 24 hours and rural areas were stated to have their power back within a day or two. Two days after the storm, 500 homes remained without electricity and frustrated residents were further angered after discovering that the Power and Water agency was in control of tree removal and not emergency services. With the power company in charge of clearing downed trees, they stated that their crews would only be dealing with cases involved power lines. Residents with trees in their yards or even on their homes were told to contact private contractors to remove them. By 9 January, more than 100 homes were still without power in northern Darwin, resulting in angry outcries from those still left in the dark. Cleanup efforts dragged on for more than two months as debris was still present in Darwin in March. Removal of tree stumps took through at least mid-April as the cost to remove downed trees exceeded A$1 million (US$882,000). Due to the damage wrought by Helen, its name was retired following its usage. However, it was not replaced by any particular name as a new naming scheme was implemented the following season.

Nichols primarily played as a backup. Offensively, his best batting average year was in 1898, his rookie season, with the Chicago Orphans where he batted .286 with a slugging percentage of .310, although he did only play in 14 games, all at catcher. The following year his average dropped to .255 but his slugging improved to .362. He played in 17 games that year (15 at catcher, two as a Pinch hitter). In 1900, still with the Orphans, he played in eight games as catcher, batting .200 and slugging .200. Not much is known as to whether he was traded to the St.Louis or if he signed because of free agency (which is very unlikely due to the Reserve clause), but once there he saw much more game play. Once in St. Louis he saw more play at other positions besides catcher. In his first season for St. Louis (1901), he made 93 appearance during the season, 47 at catcher, 40 playing in the outfield, and six as a pinch hitter. His offensive numbers improve from the year prior, batting .244 and slugging .308. He drove in a career high 33 RBIs. He was also hit ten times by pitch, which was fifth most in the league that year. Most of his appearances in 1902 were at first base. He played 56 games at first, 11 at catcher, and four in the outfield. He also made two appearances as a pinch hitter. His offensive numbers again improved, batting .267 and slugging .327. although his RBIs dropped from 33 to 31. In 1903, his use defensively dropped. He played 34 games defensively, 25 at first, two at catcher, and seven in the outfield. He also made two appearances as a pinch hitter. He batted a career low .192. His slugging percentage was .208, only eight points over his career low of .200 in 1900. Nichols spent the majority of his career in the minors. Defensively in the minors he played not only catcher, first base, and the outfield, but he also played 13 career games at shortstop, 22 at third base, and 27 at second base. Nichols retired from baseball at the age of 41. Considering he played during the dead-ball era his offensive numbers were very respectable. He also had 51 stolen bases in his career, with his best year coming in 1902 when he stole 18. He ended his career in MLB with 194 hits, (28 doubles, 3 triples, and 3 home runs). He made 44 errors in his career for an overall field percentage of .970.

A dialogue in two parts, it is by far the longest one included in his collection of essays titled Intentions published in 1 May 1891. \\"The Critic as Artist\\" is a significantly revised version of articles that first appeared in the July and September 1890 issues of The Nineteenth Century, originally entitled \\"The True Function and Value of Criticism.\\" The essay is a conversation between its leading voice Gilbert and Ernest, who suggests ideas for Gilbert to reject. Summary The essay sets to collapse the distinction between fine art and criticism cherished by artists and critics such as Matthew Arnold and James Abbott McNeill Whistler - only critical faculty enables any artistic creation at all, while criticism is independent of the object it criticises and not necessarily subject to it. The essay champions a contemplative life to the life of action. According to Gilbert, scientific principle of heredity shows we are never less free, never have more illusions than when we try to act with some conscious aim in mind. Critical contemplation is guided by conscious aesthetic sense as well as by the soul. The soul is wiser than we are, writes Wilde, it is the concentrated racial experience revealed by the imagination. Criticism is above reason, sincerity and fairness; it is necessarily subjective. It is increasingly more to criticism than to creation that future belongs as its subject matter and the need to impose form on chaos constantly increases. It is criticism rather than emotional sympathies, abstract ethics or commercial advantages that would make us cosmopolitan and serve as the basis of peace.The Critic as Artist Notes References * Wilde, Oscar. \\"The Decay of Lying\\" in Intentions (1891) * Wilde, Oscar, Complete Works (Collins, 2003) * Josephine M.

The paintings show a scene from Dante's Inferno, of Dante and Virgil in the shadows to the right viewing the murdered lovers Francesca da Rimini and Paolo Malatesta in Hell. It \\"could be described as Scheffer's best work\\".Rosenthal, L√©on, Romanticism, p. 172, 2014, Background In the first volume, Inferno, of The Divine Comedy, Dante and Virgil meet Francesca and her lover Paolo in the second circle of hell, reserved for the lustful. Da Rimini's father had forced her to marry the lame Giovanni Malatesta for political reasons, but she fell in love with Giovanni's brother Paolo. The pair carried on a love affair for many years; but when Giovanni caught them kissing, he killed them with his sword. The painting shows a wound on Paolo's chest and on Francesca's back due to his stabbing. The couple are trapped in an eternal whirlwind, doomed to be forever swept through the air just as they allowed themselves to be swept away by their passions. Dante calls out to the lovers, who are compelled to briefly pause before him, and he speaks with Francesca. She obliquely states a few of the details of her life and her death, and Dante, apparently familiar with her story, correctly identifies her by name. He asks her what led to her and Paolo's damnation, and Francesca's story strikes such a chord within Dante that he faints out of pity. The pair, depicted either during their life or following Dante, became a very popular subject in 19th-century art.

Scheffer first exhibited a painting of Paolo and Francesca at the Paris Salon in 1822. Although well received, it was overshadowed by The Barque of Dante, the first major painting by Eug√®ne Delacroix, which was exhibited in the same room. The current location of Scheffer's first painting of this subject is not known. The prime version was painted in 1835 and measures . Considered Scheffer's best version of the subject, it was acquired in 1835 by Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, inherited in 1842 by his wife H√©l√®ne, duchesse d'Orl√©ans, and sold in Paris in January 1853 to Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato. A heavily decorated frame, probably designed by F√©licie de Fauveau, was added while it was in the Demidoff collection. It was sold again in Paris in February 1870, bought by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford, and inherited by his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet. The work is now in the Wallace Collection in London.

A third full-size version of 1855 is now in the Louvre in Paris; measuring , it was acquired in 1900 from the estate of the artist's sister, Corn√©lia Scheffer.

Inspired by lead vocalist Tim McIlrath's visit to New Orleans, the song is about the slow response time for aid to disaster stricken areas. It incorporates elements of punk rock and melodic hardcore, with lyrics that allude to Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. \\"Help Is on the Way\\" premiered on KROQ-FM on January 17, 2011, and was later released as Endgames lead single on January 25. \\"Help Is on the Way\\" polarized critics, with some praising its lyrics and song structure, while others criticized it for being bland and repetitive. Despite the mixed reception, it remains one of the band's highest charting singles to date. It peaked at eighty-nine on the Billboard Hot 100, and reached number two on the Hot Rock Songs chart. The accompanying music video depicts an African-American family, as they attempt to escape increasing floodwater levels that engulf their neighborhood. Composition \\"Help Is on the Way\\" is a rock song containing elements of punk rock and melodic hardcore. John Fortunato of The Aquarian Weekly described the song as a \\"menacingly anthemic, phlegm-clearing diatribe\\". \\"Help Is on the Way\\" is written in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 108 beats per minute. It is composed in the key G minor, with a melody that spans a tonal range of D4 to B‚ô≠5. Lyrically, \\"Help Is on the Way\\" is about the slow response time for aid to disaster stricken areas. During the first and second verses, the lyrics allude to Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, as well as their affects on the Gulf Coast of the United States and the city of New Orleans. Singer Tim McIlrath maintains clean vocals throughout the majority of the song, but temporarily switches to screaming vocals during the bridge. McIlrath wrote the lyrics, which were inspired by a trip he took to New Orleans. While he had initially gone to discuss with local musicians how to merge politics with music, he was able to visit several areas affected by Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent flood, such as the Lower Ninth Ward. As McIlrath felt that news outlets were quick to discuss less important stories following the disaster, he compiled his thoughts and wrote the song's lyrics. McIlrath also noted his criticism of the United States government and how they handled these disasters influenced the lyrics; he called Hurricane Katrina \\"as much a man-made disaster as it was a natural disaster\\", and lambasted the fact that no legislation was passed to prevent another oil spill following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Release and reception \\"Help Is on the Way\\" had its world premiere on the California radio-station KROQ-FM on January 17, 2011. It was then released on January 25, as the lead single from Rise Against's sixth album Endgame. Commercially, \\"Help Is on the Way\\" is one of Rise Against's most successful singles to date. In the United States, it remains the band's only song to reach the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at eighty-nine, and reached number two on the Hot Rock Songs chart. The single also achieved international success, reaching number ten on the Australia Hitseekers chart, number forty-five on the Canadian Hot 100, number four on the Czech Republic Modern Rock chart, and number nineteen on the UK Rock & Metal chart. Critics were polarized in their opinions when reviewing \\"Help Is on the Way\\". Tim Newbound of Rock Sound described the piece as \\"impressively structured and equally furious\\", while Evan Lucy of Billboard thought it was \\"understated enough to capture radio attention and plenty explosive to please Rise Against's devoted fan base\\". Rob Parker of NME felt that \\"Help Is on the Way\\" and fellow Endgame track \\"This Is Letting Go\\" were able to \\"strike the perfect balance between punk fury and melodic accessibility without losing any of frontman Tim McIlrath‚Äôs personality\\". Chad Grischow of IGN complimented the music, saying that \\"as powerful as the lyrical content of the song is, the storm of guitars rolling over it like a gristly, foreboding cloud kick you in the chest just as hard\\". Koski and Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club were divided in their opinions, with Koski praising the powerful lyrics, while Hyden belittled the song as \\"run-of-the-mill\\". Thomas Nassiff of AbsolutePunk wrote that \\"Help Is on the Way\\" was one of the weaker moments from the album, criticizing the intro guitar riff, while comparing the lyrics to those of another Rise Against song, \\"Re-Education (Through Labor)\\". Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline was heavily critical of the song, stating that it \\"suffers from a blandness so paralyzing and repetitive\\", and ultimately summarized it as \\"totally flaccid\\". Music video alt=An aerial view of a heavily flooded city district The accompanying music video was directed by Alan Ferguson and filmed in New Orleans. It follows an African-American family as they're forced to move into their house's attic, and eventually their rooftop to escape the increasing floodwater levels caused by Hurricane Katrina. The video follows the song's lyric thread, while real footage of Hurricane Katrina and the survivors are shown throughout. It ends with a message encouraging donations, and a link to the band's activism website. The video was released on March 23, 2011. It does not feature any band members, who opted not to appear in it, as they felt their presence would be detrimental to the video's message. This decision was commended by critics, with Katie Hasty of HitFix stating that band \\"went for an artifact of truth\\".

He also drew a syndicated comic strip during the 1950s and 1960s.  Biography  Born in Sidney, Montana, Lamb was drawing while he was in the Montana Industrial School for Boys at age 17. = Prison years (1932‚Äì1947) = At age 19, in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1932, he was convicted of armed robbery and given a five-year sentence. After escaping 18 months later, he made his way to Hammond, Indiana. While working there as a self-taught sign painter, he met and married Gladys Lamb on August 4, 1934. Ten days after his marriage, he was again arrested for armed robbery and sentenced to two 25-year terms in the Indiana State Penitentiary in Michigan City, Indiana.The Atlantian, United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, Georgia, Spring 1955. On August 31, 1934, when Gladys was living in Calumet City, Illinois, she inserted a dozen broken hacksaw blades into pears and traveled to Gary, Indiana, to visit her husband in the Lake County jail. As she passed the pears to her husband, Chief deputy sheriff Carroll Holley became suspicious and intervened. (Carroll Holley was the nephew of Sheriff Lillian Holley, whose car was stolen by John Dillinger when he used a wooden gun to escape from that same jail earlier that summer.) In April 1935, Lamb was escorted to Chicago to visit Gladys after their son James William Lamb, born March 26, 1935, had died on April 10, 1935. Clyde escaped from a guard at the train station by running in front of a moving train. Shot by a police officer when he was captured July 1935, he was returned to prison. Gladys Lamb filed for a divorce at Clyde's insistence, which was granted on November 1, 1937. She remarried and after Clyde was released June 24, 1947, Lamb left for Glendive, Montana, to visit relatives. Gladys and Clyde Lamb remarried in Glendive, Montana, on October 14, 1947.Lambiek: Clyde LambAncestry.com = Art career = Clyde Lamb's Herman (January 12, 1964) During the 1940s, Lamb began drawing while in prison and he was mentored by the prison crafts director on techniques. At first Clyde Lamb painted oil landscapes of his beloved Montana and a self portrait then he started to draw comics. He was urged to sell his cartoons by the prison arts and crafts Director. While Clyde was in prison he successfully marketed his cartoons to The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, The American Magazine and other publications. During the last year while incarcerated he made $11,000. His success and the surrounding publicity led directly to his release. Granted a new trial, he was convicted, but Judge William J. Murray at Crown Point gave him a ten-year suspended sentence. He was still wanted in Tennessee as an escaped convict, but Tennessee Governor Jim Nance McCord commuted his sentence and ordered him paroled to Indiana authorities.\\"Pen Mightier Than Hot Rod, Artist Finds\\". Sarasota Herald Tribune, June 24, 1947.\\"His Pen Mightier Than Gun, Convict Is Sure; He's Free\\". The Milwaukee Journal, June 24, 1947. The couple traveled extensively through California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, Washington, Europe, Africa, and Mexico from 1947 until his death. On November 14, 1949, Lamb launched his pantomime newspaper comic strip, Herman, as a daily, with a Sunday strip added November 2, 1952. Distributed by Iowa's Register and Tribune Syndicate, Lamb's strip was carried during the 1950s in 55 newspapers in the United States, India and Africa, lasting until 1966. (It had no connection to the strip Herman by Jim Unger.) On March 2, 1955, Lamb was surprised on live television to learn that Ralph Edwards had made him the subject of that week's This Is Your Life episode. The episode is available at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. In 1957, Lamb began Open Season, a newspaper gag cartoon panel about hunting and fishing. Lamb also created oil paintings of landscapes mainly oil on canvas of the upper northwest and Montana areas. Clyde also produced a cartoon strip about an elephant named Milicent. Many other cartoons appeared in detective magazines and men's sporting publications. He produced many cartoons for calendars while under contract with Brown & Bigelow. Gladys and Clyde In November 1956, Clyde and Gladys were vacationing in Miami with plans to extend their vacation to Havana. His last address in the United States was 22839 Saticoy Street in Canoga Park in Los Angeles. = Death = At the age of 53, he died of pancreatic disease in Dublin, Ireland, on July 8, 1966, and was cremated at the Belfast Crematorium in Northern Ireland on August 12, 1966.

Despite being invisible, the hand always leaves small hand prints among the surface of what it touches. Her family is apparently a zaibatsu that had ties to the Queen Airlines plane crash, so she was originally a loner and preferred to keep to herself while using her ability to prevent the other students from playing cruel pranks on her. She seems to be developing feelings for Sumio. ; :A third-year student, class G. His ability allows him to \\"rewind\\" things making them return to the past. It is introduced and explained in chapter 26. He is very strong but stubborn. Due to his stepfather's abusiveness (an episode of which caused the large scar on his back that is the root of his powers) and being forced to apologize for no reason, he has an intense disdain for anything irrational. ; :A second year at Yuyami High as of two years ago. His ability is Flat, introduced in chapter 11, which allows the user to enter a flat world, such as a picture, and interact with its contents. He initially tricks the party into believing that he is Mizusawa Aru, but it is later revealed he was one of the students who failed the second E-Test. Where before his personality mirrored that of Sumio, as time went on his group turned on him and was swallowed by Shadows during the test. This left only Jiro and himself, but Ryo was ambushed by Shadows right before escaping, leaving Jiro as the only survivor. While there, the Shadows corroded his good beliefs with selfish and cruel desires to escape with any means. It wasn't until Jiro gave him the pill did he return to his normal self again. ; :The antagonist and mysterious controller of the E-Test. He is represented by the symbol of a human skull with the jaw in the opposite direction (resembling a lower case e), but it is later revealed by Jiro that Enigma is indeed human with a noticeable mark on his right hand. Enigma‚Äôs identity is finally unveiled to be Kirio Imizuka, a childhood friend of Sumio, but the mantle is later passed to Sumio himself to further Kirio‚Äôs goals. ; :A teacher at Yuyami High School, Kijima's pleasant personality makes him popular with students, but it is all a 'fa√ßade' that masks an insane obsession with developing the abilities of others by subjecting them to the E-Tests. It is initially believed that he is Enigma, but Sumio discovers later that he is acting in proxy. It was revealed at the end of E-Test that his obsession with developing abilities of others and creating a stage of E-Test are all due to the wish Kirio made on Enigma skull, which Kijima couldn't disobey. Kijima is in fact a kind gentleman trying to protect the people with abilities and to protect Kirio from the curse that Enigma skull brings. His ability is manipulation of the alternate Yuyami High‚Äôs orientation and physical properties through a laptop in the real world. ; :A silent boy who used to be Shigeru and Sumio‚Äôs friend, Kirio inherited the Enigma skull from his father and thus gained its powers. After obtaining it, he was stabbed in the throat and broadcast a cry for help, turning those that heard it into ability users and thus catalyzing the plot. Although Kirio survived, he later would be convicted for the hijacking and crashing of an airplane which killed all others aboard, and was sentenced to life in prison. The E-Tests were thus brought about for him to get revenge on the actual hijacker. Yuta Kijima is his stepbrother. ; :A classmate of Sumio's and an ardent occultist. Kei is roped into the E-Test via the delivery of a cellphone that facilitates a telepathic connection between him and Sumio. He maintains a webpage about urban legends and is familiar with the story of Enigma, which he knows under the name of the ‚ÄúHandprint Phantom.‚Äù ; :The extremely kind nurse of Yuyami High, Yumikawa was one of the people to hear Kirio‚Äôs cry and become an ability user. She was later convicted for the murder of a student and was sent to jail: however, Kijima later reveals that he framed her because her ability (attracting other ability users) would put her life in danger. Both Sudo and Kijima had feelings for her. Manga Enigma began serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump on September 13, 2010, and ended on October 31, 2011, for a total of 55 chapters.

For a full list of former state highways in Indiana, see the List of former state highways in Indiana.  State Road 403  State Road 403 was a six-mile (10 km) northeast-to-southwest route that lies entirely within Clark County.  State Road 407  State Road 407 ran from State Road 7 to State Road 3. The route is now Jennings County Road 350 West and CR 500 North.  State Road 420  SR 420 was the original number of Tri-State Expressway; the name was later changed to Borman Expressway.  State Road 431  Map of Indiana State Road 431 The former State Road 431, now simply Keystone Parkway, remains a busy route connecting U.S. Route 31 with Interstate 465 at Exit 33. It passes through the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel, allowing traffic on U.S. 31 north of Carmel a shorter route to I-465 and the east side of Indianapolis. Until the 1990s, the State Road 431 designation extended south of I-465 to 86th Street. Prior to that, it also continued south along N. Keystone Avenue to S.R. 37 at Fall Creek Parkway, North Drive in Indianapolis. State Road 431 was officially decommissioned on October 19, 2007, with the portions north of 96th Street being turned over to the city of Carmel.Daniels announces agreement to transfer ownership of Keystone Avenue (press release), Indiana Department of Transportation, 2007-09-06. Carmel Mayor James Brainard immediately proposed banning heavy trucks from the route, the Hamilton County portions of which lies within his city's corporate limits. He also pushed for a plan to build six roundabout-style interchanges on Keystone, built 2009-2010, in lieu of widening it to at least six travel lanes throughout.Project CarmelLink. City of Carmel, Indiana. Further south in Marion County, a former southern portion of S.R. 431 extended south along Madison Avenue from the south side of Indianapolis through Greenwood. Madison Avenue, which was the original routing of U.S. 31 on Indy's south side, does not have an interchange with I-465, however. The northern terminus of this section was at Madison's intersection with East Street, which used to carry U.S. 31 to the south. The southern terminus was where Madison merges with existing U.S. 31 alignment in Johnson County just south of Smith Valley Road, south of the old Greenwood Middle School.  State Road 434  State Road 434 ran from U.S. Route 421 to U.S. Route 31 on 73rd Street in Indianapolis.

Schuster of Eastern Kentucky University found a second specimen and authored the paper announcing the discovery of the new species. The creek has been studied for half a century, so this species is believed to be rare.

Churner, 532 U.S. 731 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case decided in 2001. The case concerned the extent to which a state prisoner must first utilize an administrative review process provided by the state, prior to filing a case in federal district court. The Court held that Booth still had a mechanism of administrative review, and thus his claim was premature. Background The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requires a prisoner to exhaust \\"such administrative remedies as are available\\" before suing over prison conditions. Timothy Booth, an inmate at the State Correctional Institution at Smithfield, Pennsylvania, filed a suit in District Court, claiming that corrections officers violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Booth sought both injunctive relief and monetary damages. At the time of Booth's suit, Pennsylvania provided an administrative grievance and appeals system, which addressed Booth's complaints but had no provision for recovery of money damages. After the prison authority denied his administrative grievance, Booth did not seek administrative review. Subsequently, the District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. In affirming, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Booth's argument that the exhaustion requirement was inapplicable because the administrative process could not award him the monetary relief he sought. He appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case. The attorneys general of over 30 states filed amicus curiae briefs at the Court, urging affirmance of the decision.532 U.S. at 733. Opinion of the Court Justice David Souter wrote the unanimous majority opinion of the court, which agreed with the Third Circuit in rejecting Booth's claims. The Court held that even though the prison grievance procedure did not provide for requested monetary relief, Booth was nonetheless required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing suit with respect to prison conditions. Justice Souter wrote for the Court, \\"we think that Congress has mandated exhaustion clearly enough, regardless of the relief offered through administrative procedures.\\" Therefore, Booth's suit was premature.

It overlaps U.S. Route 71 (US 71) in the western part of the state, beginning at Pineville, just a few miles north of the Arkansas state line, and ending at I-435 and I-470 on the southeast side of Kansas City. I-49 is planned to extend south into Arkansas upon completion of a bypass of Bella Vista, Arkansas, connecting to the new northern Arkansas segment of I-49 (formerly part of I-540 to Fort Smith). Upon completion, the highway will connect with I-49 in Louisiana, connecting Kansas City to Texarkana, Shreveport, and Lafayette, Louisiana. Route description I-49 begins in Pineville. It passes through many smaller communities before reaching Joplin. In Joplin, I-49 junctions with I-44 and begins a short overlap with I-44 for exits 11 through 18. Just a few miles east of Joplin, I-49 leaves I-44 and heads north and enters Carthage. I-49 then passes through Nevada and other communities before reaching the Kansas City area. I-49 intersects with I-470 and I-435 which provides connection to I-70 and I-35 and I-29. In south Kansas City, at Bannister Road just north of the Grandview Triangle, the I-49 designation ends, and the expressway continues as US 71, which proceeds into downtown Kansas City as Bruce R. Watkins Memorial Drive. History Current southern terminus of I-49. The closed ramp will serve as the northern end of the Bella Vista Bypass upon completion. Arkansas and Missouri pursued an I-49 designation for US 71 and I-540 for a number of years. In the early 2000s, there were plans by both states to rename the roadway as such between I-44 west of Joplin and I-40 at Fort Smith once new roadway had been completed around Bella Vista, Arkansas, and north to Pineville, Missouri. However, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering denied the I-49 designation at their annual meeting in September 2007 because none of the new roadway was under construction. The I-49 upgrade involved removing all at- grade intersections and constructing interchanges and overpasses at 15 sites between Harrisonville and Lamar. The two-year project represented a shift in funding priorities for MoDOT which in 2007, had announced the indefinite postponement of its portion of the Bella Vista bypass project, citing a $139-million funding gap in Arkansas between construction costs and toll revenues, and Arkansas' commitment to only a two-lane bypass constructed over six years. MoDOT announced the Joplin-to-Kansas City upgrade of US 71 in August 2010, to be done with the intention of bringing the I-49 designation to Missouri. MoDOT began installing I-49 trailblazer signage (without shields) plus gantry signs and mile markers, about 1200 signs in all, in February 2012. Signage bearing I-49 shields were covered or turned from view until the I-49 designation was given final approval by the Federal Highway Administration. This includes mile markers at intervals along the entire alignment apart from I-44. The I-49 designation in Missouri became official at noon on December 12, 2012. The designation applies to of current US 71 between Bannister Road (Route W) in south Kansas City and Route H at Pineville (McDonald County) which was upgraded to Interstate standards beginning in 2010. The last of the upgrade projects were completed in December 2012, but some designations about north of the Arkansas state line still have not been built to meet interstate standards. In 2012, Missouri had $40 million available for its portion of the Bella Vista bypass, but moved the money elsewhere in 2013. They planned on using money from a proposed constitutional amendment which would have raised the sales tax; however, this was defeated by voters in August 2014. Arkansas has announced it will not extend its section to Missouri until construction begins on the Missouri section. Future In March 2019, the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission approved the remaining funding needed to complete the Missouri portion of Bella Vista Bypass. On April 1, 2020, the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission awarded the construction of the 5 mile Missouri portion of the Bella Vista Bypass to Emery Sapp & Sons Inc for $58.7 million. The new estimated completion date is September 30, 2021.

Life Bryan was the son of Robert Bryan of Limington, Somerset, sometime minister of St. Mary's, Newington, Surrey, and was born at Limington. He became a semi-commoner of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, in 1665, but left the university without taking a degree. After holding a benefice in the Diocese of Bath and Wells for about ten years, he was appointed to his father's old living, St. Mary's, Newington, and to the afternoon lectureship at St. Michael's, Crooked Lane. His living was sequestered for debt in 1684. A sermon preached by him at Newington and at St. Michael's (26 October and 2 November of the same year) on 2 Corinthians 5:11 was said to contain reflections on the King's courts of justice, and an accusation was laid against him before the Dean of Arches. In order to vindicate himself he printed this sermon, which certainly does not appear to contain any such reflections, with a dedication, dated 10 December 1684, to Peter Mews, Bishop of Winchester, formerly his diocesan in Somerset. The archbishop was satisfied that the charge against him was groundless, and it was quashed accordingly. In July 1685 Bryan accumulated the degrees of civil law at Oxford. Refusing to take the oaths on the accession of William III and Mary II, he lost his preferment, and became the minister of a Jacobite congregation meeting in St. Dunstan's Court, Fleet Street. This brought him into trouble several times. On 1 January 1693 his meeting was discovered, the names of his congregation, consisting of about a hundred persons, were taken, and he was arrested. He died on 10 March 1699, and was buried in St. Dunstan's-in-the-West. Works His works are: The Certainty of the future Judgment asserted and proved (the sermon referred to above), 1685 ; 'A Persuasion to the stricter Observance of the Lord's Day,' a sermon, 1686; 'St. Paul's Triumph in his Sufferings,' a sermon, 1692.

He also wrote two copies of verses printed in Ellis Waller's translation of the Encheiridion of Epictetus into English verse, 1702, and republished Humphrey Lynde's Account of Bertram the Priest, 1686.

At Bled 2011 in an upset, the Australian quad defeated the fancied German crew to win world championship gold. Following a costly mistake in the German boat the Australian crew took the lead in the last few metres of the race and won by 0.25secs. The world champion Australian quad remained together with seats unchanged into the 2012 London Olympics. At Eton Dorney they placed third in their heat but qualified through to the semi-final where they finished second behind Croatia. In the 2012 Olympic final they were in fourth place at each mark before coming home to take the bronze medal behind the Croatian and the German boats. Noonan made no retirement announcement after London and in fact continued to row at the highest national level into 2013, however ultimately the 2012 Olympics proved to be his last Australian representative appearance. In 2012 he was appointed as the Head of Rowing at his former school St Ignatius College.Noonan post 2012 Olympics  References  Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Olympic medalists in rowing Category:Rowers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Australia Category:Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Australian male rowers Category:World Rowing Championships medalists for Australia ","title":"Daniel Noonan"},{"id":"30545988","text":"Buddy Bear Help is a children's aid organisation founded in Berlin in 2004 by Eva Herlitz together with several international artists. \\"Every cent for the children\\" - with this motto Buddy Bear Help e.V. guarantees that 100 per cent of the donations and auction revenues from charity activities is used for the selected children's projects. All organisational and administrative costs are borne by the club members. History Furat al Jamil, an artist from Iraq, who designed the bears for her country for the United Buddy Bears project, wanted to help, with the support of Buddy B√§r Berlin GmbH, a five-year-old boy in Baghdad who had a tumor behind his eye and the surgical removal of which was not possible in Baghdad. The boy was to be brought to Berlin for the surgery. Since funds were not immediately available, the help offered came too late. In order to be able to help quicker, in a more targeted and bureaucratic manner, the Buddy Bear Help organisation was founded in 2004. To send a political message at the time of the Iraq War, one of the founding members of the club was Marsha Coats (wife of U.S. Ambassador to Germany from 2001 - 2005, Daniel R. Coats). Help for Children in Need Since 2004, children in need (Kindern in Not) have been helped worldwide. Among other things, the financing of heart surgeries for children in La Paz (Bolivia) was secured, a school project for Maasai in Tanzania was implemented, in 2009 the construction of a school for AIDS orphans in Tepa Tepa, a small village near Lake Malawi, was completed. In other school projects, individual children in Jamaica and Sri Lanka as well as several schools in Nigeria were supported. The organisation Die Arche has been steadily supported by the activities of Buddy B√§r since 2003. Since 2009, Die Arche has also been supported by Buddy Bear Help, with the organisation carrying the costs of rent for the new Arche location in Berlin-Wedding.ARCHE in Berlin-Wedding Yet the organisation also wants to enable schoolchildren in Berlin to put themselves into the shoes of children who are less fortunate.Buddy Bear Help e.V. and Campus Bildung im Quadrat in Berlin References External links * Buddy Bear Help website * The Golden Buddy Bears & Buddy Bear Help _________________________________ Category:Children's charities based in Germany Category:Health charities in Germany Category:Organizations established in 2004 Category:Non-profit organisations based in Berlin ","title":"Buddy Bear Help"},{"id":"30545995","text":"quadruple sculls final at the 2012 Summer Olympics Tim Grohmann (born 27 December 1988) is a German rower.

William Bull Life Bull was born at Irthlingborough, near Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, the third son of John Bull. The children were brought up by their grandfather Francis Bull. Bull learned to read the Hebrew alphabet, studied in William Whiston's Mathematics, and a contributed to Martin's Mathematical Magazine. He left his job, and went to live with his elder brother John, in Bedford. He worked on Latin under the Rev. Samuel Saunderson, and learned Greek with the Rev. James Belsham, pastor of the independent church at Newport Pagnell, who lived in Bedford. In 1759 he was admitted a student of Daventry Academy. He remained a Calvinist, in a less orthodox milieu. In 1764 Bull succeeded Belsham as pastor of the church at Newport Pagnell, and to increase his income took pupils. Among his scholars was Sir John Leach, master of the rolls. Bull formed an acquaintance with the Rev. John Newton of Olney, resulting in a lifelong relationship and frequent correspondence. Bull occasionally preached at the great house at Olney, where Newton conducted his prayer meetings with the assistance of William Cowper. Later Bull knew Cowper better, and preserved several of Cowper's poems. He also induced Cowper to translate into English verse some of the poems of Madame Guyon, printed at Newport Pagnell, with a preface by Bull. At Olney vicarage Bull met Mrs. Wilberforce, aunt of William Wilberforce, and sister to John Thornton. She invited Bull to visit her in London, and there she introduced him to Thornton. About this time the evangelicals projected a new academy as preparation for the ministry. Newton drew up a plan, and a proposal was made for Bull to superintend the arrangements, and thus turn Bull's school into an academy. In 1782 he founded the Newport Pagnell Theological College, also known as the Academy. In 1783 the academy started with two students; it increased its numbers, and continued for many years. Supported mainly by Thornton, it trained about 100 ministers. His acquaintance with Mrs. Wilberforce and the Thorntons also brought Bull into the company of Zachary Macaulay, Mr. Thomas Babington, and their friends Colonel Makelcan and Major Handfield. These were prominent figures in the Clapham Sect. Besides teaching, Bull frequently preached in London; and Lady Huntingdon's chapels often invited him. Although he lived a long and busy life, Bull's health was never robust. In the opening of the year 1814 he became weaker, and died on 23 July in the seventy-seventh year of his age. Together with his son Thomas Palmer Bull and his grandson Josiah Bull, the Bull family's ministry to the town spanned 105 years. Works Bull was occupied three or four years in writing an Exposition of the Book of Psalms. A tract, Seasonable Hints, was written while on a trip to Ireland, printed at Dublin, and distributed during the journey. Bull contributed to Thornton's edition of Karl Heinrich von Bogatzky's Golden Treasury, published in 1775. A Brief Narrative of the Rise and Progress of the Independent Church of Newport (1811) was a joint work of Bull and his son Thomas. Family In 1768 Bull married a daughter of Thomas Palmer of Bedford.

Life St. Mary's Church, Madras Burgoyne entered the army at an early age. After serving in the 7th Fusiliers and other corps, he obtained the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 58th Foot in Ireland in 1764. Some years later he was transferred to that of the 14th Light Dragoons, then on the Irish establishment. The 'Calendar of Home Office Papers,' 1770‚Äì2, pars. 224, 639, shows these appointments to have been dictated by political as well as professional considerations. In 1781 Burgoyne was commissioned to raise a regiment of light dragoons for service in India, the first European cavalry sent out to that country. This corps, originally known as the 23rd Light Dragoons, was formed out of drafts from other regiments, and had its rendezvous at Bedford. Standards, now in possession of the 19th Hussars, were presented to it by George III, and early in 1782 it embarked, with other reinforcements, on board the East India fleet under convoy of Admiral Sir R. Bickerton, and landed at Madras towards the end of the year. Under its changed name of the 19th Light Dragoons it subsequently won great renown on Indian battle-fields. Burgoyne was promoted to the rank of major-general on the Madras staff in 1783. He died at Madras in 1785. He had married Charlotte, daughter of General Johnstone of Overston, Northamptonshire, and by this lady, who afterwards married, secondly, Lieutenant-general Eyre Power Trench, he left several children. Burgoyne's eldest son, Sir Montague Roger Burgoyne, 8th Baronet, was also a cavalry officer, and like his father ultimately became a major-general. He entered the army as cornet in the Scots Greys in 1789, and in 1795 became lieutenant-colonel of the short-lived 32nd Light Dragoons. He was afterwards for some years one of the inspecting field-officers of yeomanry and volunteer corps. He died at his mother's residence in Oxford Street, London, on 11 Aug. 1817. Shortly before his death Burgoyne was the object of a curious and vexatious prosecution, in which the vicar of his parish sued him for penalties under an old law for not having attended divine service during a period exceeding twelve months. The proceedings fell through.

The college was founded by Reverend Isaac Hellmuth and was inaugurated by Prince Arthur. The college had no official connection with a church; but under the patronage of its founder and namesake, it was thoroughly Anglican. Princess Louise became its patroness on her visit in 1878.Report of the Minister of Education, Ontario Department of Education (1882), pg. 414 The college was devoted to the study of arts and sciences. It was located on Richmond Street North, just south of Windermere Road on the hill overlooking the Thames River. Hellmuth Ladies' College was complemented by Hellmuth College ‚Äî for young men, founded 1865 ‚Äî also of London, Ontario. Hellmuth Ladies' College closed sometime between 1899 and 1901. The properties were acquired by the Sisters of St. Joseph and transformed into Mount St. Joseph Orphanage.  Property  ;The land In 1867, Isaac Hellmuth purchased 150 acres with a hill overlooking the Thames River, and commissioned the design and construction of Hellmuth Ladies‚Äô College. ;The main building The main building was designed by Gundry & Langley, a Toronto- based architectural firm headed by Thomas Gundry (1830‚Äì1869) and Henry Langley (1836‚Äì1907). Since the closing of the college in 1899, the building served as a convent and orphanage. It stood until 1976, when it was demolished. Mount St. Joseph Academy for girls continued in that location until 1985. As of 2011, the building and its grounds are the official home of Windermere On The Mount, a retirement residence operated by Revera. The main building took on a new role in 1899, when it was purchased by the Sisters of St. Joseph, a Roman Catholic order of sisters dedicated to caring for orphans and the elderly, educating young girls, and ministering to the poor. Under its new name, Mount St. Joseph Mother House, the building and property served as both an orphanage and a convent for the sisters. ;The chapel Isaac Hellmuth erected a small chapel, just a short walk from the main building, and named it St. Anne's Chapel, in honor of the then Lady Principal, Anne Mills. ;Norwood House Residence of Bishop Hellmuth.

She was a daughter of King Charles IV of Spain, in 1795, she married her uncle Infante Antonio Pascual of Spain. Early life Infanta Mar√≠a Amalia in 1791, by Ram√≥n Bayeu. Born at the Royal Palace of El Pardo, Maria Amalia was the second surviving daughter of King Carlos IV of Spain (1748‚Äì1819) and his wife Maria Luisa of Parma (1751‚Äì1819), a granddaughter of Louis XV of France.Rubio, Reinas de Espa√±a, p. 348 Maria Amalia's mother, Queen Maria Luisa, arranged her marriage to her maternal first cousin Louis, hereditary Prince of Parma. The Prince arrived at the Spanish court, in 1794, to finish his education. He was blond, good looking, of amiable character and he had a great interest in science.Rubio, Reinas de Espa√±a, p. 315 Five years younger than her cousin, Infanta Maria Amalia was fifteen years old at the time. She was not particularly attractive and was sullen, reserved and shy in character.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 90. Louis, who was equally shy, preferred her younger sister, Infanta Maria Luisa, who although only twelve, was of a more cheerful disposition and somewhat better looking. Maria Amalia's parents accepted the unexpected change of brides, but it became a matter of urgency for them to find a husband for the saddened and scorned Maria Amalia.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 83. As she was the elder of the two sisters, it would be humiliating for Maria Amalia that her younger sister not only would marry her previous fiance, but that Maria Luisa would marry first. Marriage and death To find a new groom for Maria Amalia of a royal rank in such a short period of time was not an easy affair; thus her parents decided to marry Maria Amalia to her uncle, Antonio Pascual, Infante of Spain, who was twenty-four years older than she was. Infante Ant√¥nio was thirty nine years old. Considered of very limited intelligence, his interests were gardening, agriculture and hunting.Mateos, Los desconocidos infantes de Espa√±a, p. 84. He had remained unmarried without responsibilities of any kind. Maria Amalia married her uncle on 25 August 1795 at the Royal Palace of La Granja. It was a double wedding; at the same time her sister, 13-year-old Maria Luisa, married Luis, Prince of Parma, Maria Amalia's original intended groom. The two couples continued living at the Spanish royal court. During the fall 1797, Maria Amalia became pregnant with her first child. On 20 July 1798 she went into labour.Rubio, Reinas de Espa√±a, p. 321 The delivery was complicated. The baby got stuck by the shoulders in the birth canal and the doctors were unable to extract him. After two days, the surgeon finally intervened. By then the baby, a boy, was dead. While her son was buried at El Escorial, Maria Amalia suffered in agony. She had contracted an infection during the ordeal, and she died on 22 July 1798. She was only nineteen years old. Ancestry Notes References *Bearne Charlton, Catherine. A Royal Quartette. London: T.

Biography She was the daughter of Martin Bellier, a porter, and married baron Pierre de Beauvais. She became a chambermaid (Premi√®re femme de Chambre) to the French Queen, Anne of Austria, mother to King Louis XIV. During her time as the Queen's chambermaid, she had the intimate duty of giving the Queen her enema. She is described as intelligent, plotting and a trusted companion of the queen dowager regent. Despite being described as ugly, she had several love affairs, such as the one with the arch bishop of Sens. In 1652, Queen Anne worried about her teenaged son being plagued by sexual dysfunction like his father. The Queen encouraged Bellier to deflower the 15 year old king and ensure that he was capable of producing heirs. Their relationship lasted for two years, after which the queen dowager awarded Bellier an estate and a pension. As it was French custom to imitate the king, Catherine Bellier's sexual favors suddenly became high demand. She even had Archbishop of Sen, Henri-Louis de Gondrin as one of her lovers. As Catherine aged, she became overweight, her looks faded, and she fell into debt. By the time her husband died in 1647, she was destitute and was forced to live as a renter in the Hotel de Beauvais. Legacy King Louis XIV funded the Hotel de Beauvais in the Marais in Paris as a reward to Catherine. She is portrayed by Val√©rie Thoumire in the French-produced television series drama Versailles.

Location  The settlement is situated just north of the Harz mountain range at the entrance of the densely forested Ecker valley, about downstream of the Ecker Dam. Located on the rim of the Bad Harzburg municipal area, about east of the town centre, its direct neighbour is the village of Stapelburg, part of the Ilsenburg municipality in the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The parish is part of the Harz Nature Park; from here, the protected area of the Harz National Park stretches up to the Brocken massif in the south.  History  The Ecker valley above the present-day settlement was the site of the medieval Ahlsburg fortress, an Imperial castle presumably erected in the 12th century. The picturesque vale was linked to public transport with the opening of the Wernigerode‚ÄìIlsenburg‚ÄìBad Harzburg railway line via Stapelburg and Eckertal on 1 October 1894. Two years later the Jungborn destination spa was founded in the Ecker valley, temporary home of notable guests like Franz Kafka in July 1912. In the course of the German re-armament, the Luftwaffe forces in 1936 had a vast aircraft munitions depot (Luft-Munitionsanstalt, Muna) built on the railway line in the Schimmerwald forest northwest of the village. It was destroyed in the last days of World War II on 10 April 1945, when retiring German troops blew it up while US Army forces entered the region. The blast left severe damages in the surrounding villages and even destroyed window panes in the Bad Harzburg train station about away. On the munitions site, which had an area of 270 ha, there were over 120 bunkers and a large number of bomb craters with a diameter of up to .Thamm, W.: Feuerwerker im Einsatz. Die Kampfmittelbeseitigung in der BRD 1945 - 1993, 2nd ed., Osnabr√ºck 1997, p. 182. The Lower Saxon bomb disposal service continued to work at Eckertal until 2011. View over the border fortifications, During the period of the post-war division of Germany, Eckertal was the site where the Inner German border along the Ecker interrupted the Bundesstra√üe 6. Likewise, Eckertal became the terminus for trains from Bad Harzburg and the railway tracks were finally dismantled in the 1970s. A restaurant and an observation post overlooking the border installations were a popular destination for day-trippers. After the Wall was opened on 9 November 1989 in Berlin, the inner German Border followed suit. On 11 November 1989 around 4.30 pm the highway was re-opened between Eckertal and Stapelburg. From a historic point of view this was the first new border crossing between East and West Germany in the process of reunification. Today a monument commemorates this event. It bears the inscription \\"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit f√ºr das Deutsche Vaterland\\" from the third stanza of the Deutschlandlied.

He called these his \\"Ill-Spelled Diaries\\", and they are full of idiosyncratic and chauvinistic observations of things he encountered, his impressions of Japan, the Russo-Japanese War, and the daily life of the people. They included illustrations and mementoes from around the world. He journeyed to the Far East, visiting Ceylon and Burma. He arrived in Japan on Christmas Eve 1897, and he remained there until February 1900, when he set off to return to England via New Guinea and Fiji. However, he became ill and abandoned the journey, returning to Japan instead. In 1903 and again in 1905 he did travel to England, visiting China, Singapore, and Ceylon on his way. He returned to Kyoto at the end of 1905 where he continued transcribing folktales and myths and filling his diaries with his observations. He also collected animals and plants, which he sent to the British Museum. Many of these were new to science and were named in his honour. In 1908, he published Ancient Tales and Folklore of Japan, but it was not greeted with much interest in Britain. In the preface he states: By 1910 his financial circumstances were deteriorating, and his wife was asking for a legal separation. He suffered from beriberi and malaria and his health continued to worsen. The last entry in his diary was made in September 1915. He died on the 6 November 1918, and an obituary was published in the Japanese \\"Weekly Chronicle\\". He was awarded the Fourth Order of the Rising Sun in Japan.

History  THE HISTORY OF THE PARISH OF SAINT CATHERINE OF SIENA, Trumbull, Connecticut, where our parish is located, is today within the territory of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport, which was established by Pope Pius XII in 1953, which comprises all of Fairfield County, in southwestern Connecticut. Prior to that, it was part of the Diocese of Hartford, established in 1843 by Pope Gregory XVI, which then comprised all of Connecticut. Earlier still, it was part of the Diocese of Boston, established in 1808 by Pope Pius VII, whose territory at the time encompassed all of New England. And originally, when the Catholic Church was first being organized in the United States, Trumbull was part of the territory of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, established in 1789 by Pope Pius VI, which, as the first Catholic diocese in the United States, comprised, at the time, all the territory in the young and growing nation. On February 11, 1955, the Most Reverend Lawrence J. Shehan, the first Bishop of Bridgeport, canonically established a new Parish, to be located in the ‚ÄúNichols‚Äù section of Trumbull, territory which until then had been part of the Parish of Saint Charles Borromeo in Bridgeport. Bishop Shehan appointed Father Edward D. Halloran to be the first Pastor of this new parish, which is thought to have been named for Saint Catherine of Siena in honor of Father Halloran's mother, Mrs. Catherine Halloran. With the assistance of Father Thomas B. Gloster, Pastor of St. Charles Borromeo Parish, the Diocese of Bridgeport had purchased some 11 acres of land and two houses on Shelton Road in Trumbull. This was to be the site of our parish church and campus. While arrangements were being made for Sunday Masses to be offered within the Parish boundaries, Masses were offered for one month at the Thomas Hooker School in Bridgeport, beginning on February 20, 1955. Beginning on March 20, 1955, with the permission of the Trumbull School Board, Mass was offered at Nichols School for over three years. As plans for the church progressed, Bishop Shehan arranged for the Most Reverend Fulton J. Sheen, the celebrated author, television personality, and host of the award-winning television show Life is Worth Living, to present a lecture on March 22, 1957, at the Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, the proceeds of which benefitted the Church Building Fund for Saint Catherine of Siena Parish. This lecture was so successful that Bishop Shehan and Father Halloran, in gratitude, designated the sanctuary of Saint Catherine of Siena Church as a gift of Bishop Sheen. Then an Auxiliary Bishop of New York and National Director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, Bishop Sheen went on to serve as Bishop of Rochester, New York, and later as Titular Archbishop of Newport. He died on December 9, 1979, and is interred in the crypt of Saint Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. His cause for beatification and canonization has been introduced. From concept, to completion, to celebration Ground was broken for our parish church in August 1957, the year which appears on the church's cornerstone. The church was designed in the Norman Gothic style by Architect J. Gerald Phelan. Its stained glass windows ‚Äì depicting Apostles, Religious Founders, and the patron saints of the Catholic churches in the City of Bridgeport ‚Äì were fashioned in Brussels, Belgium by the firm of J. Vosch. The church was constructed by the E&F; Construction Company of Bridgeport, and dedicated on September 21, 1958. The Mass was celebrated by Father Halloran, with Father John J. Bennett as Deacon and Father Daniel J. Foley as Subdeacon; the homilist was Father Joseph A. Heffernan. The Fairfield University Alumni Glee Club served as the choir for the Mass, and the organist was Father Thomas A. Murphy, S.J. Bishop Shehan was present in choro for the Mass. When the Parish of Saint Catherine of Siena was established, the reigning Pope was Pius XII; the President of the United States was Dwight D. Eisenhower; and the Governor of Connecticut was Abraham A. Ribicoff. In 1955, the average house cost $22,000; the words ‚ÄúIn God We Trust‚Äù were added to all U.S. currency; the arrest of Rosa Parks in Montgomery, Alabama, set the U.S. Civil Rights Movement in motion; the USS Nautilus became the first operational nuclear-powered submarine; and the popular game show ‚ÄúThe $64,000 Question‚Äù aired for the first time. Further Expansion As the years unfolded, the Parish of Saint Catherine of Siena grew and expanded. Recognizing the importance of handing on the gift of the Catholic Faith to new generations, by 1964 the parish had grown to the point that a school could be considered. Father Halloran secured a commitment from the School Sisters of Notre Dame to teach at the school ‚Äì a service which continued until the retirement of the school's longest-serving Principal, Sister Anne Marie Dorff, S.S.N.D., who led the school from 1978 until 2009. In 1964, construction began simultaneously on the school building and on the parish rectory, both of which were designed by William F. Griffin, AIA, a Saint Catherine's parishioner. In September, 1965, the first three classes of Saint Catherine of Siena School began: Grades 1, 2, and 7, with 71 students enrolled, originally meeting in the Church Hall. Two more classes were added in 1966, when the school building was completed. Two more classes were added in 1967, and the school reached its full capacity of eight grades and 250 students in 1968. Kindergarten was added in 1975. In April, 1967, Monsignor John F. McGough was named the second Pastor of Saint Catherine of Siena Parish by the Most Reverend Walter W. Curtis, the second Bishop of Bridgeport. Msgr. McGough was followed nine years later by our third Pastor, Father Richard J. Monahan, who was also appointed by Bishop Curtis, and who served Saint Catherine's until his retirement from active ministry in 1991. The 1970s and 1980s saw continued growth, together with the completion of several special projects, including an addition to Saint Catherine of Siena School in 1987, designed by parishioner Alfred Szymanski, AIA, of Fletcher Thompson, and built by the P. Francini Construction Company of Derby, Connecticut. Additionally, during this period, a new side parking lot was installed, the church was air conditioned, and the mortgages of the church and the school were retired. The Pastorate of Msgr. Shea In July, 1991, Monsignor Richard J. Shea was installed as the fourth Pastor of Saint Catherine of Siena Parish. Appointed to serve our Parish by then-Bishop Edward M. Egan, Msgr. Shea had served since 1976 as Principal of the nearby St. Joseph High School. Msgr. Shea's 23-year pastorate saw enormous expansion and improvement. Soon after Msgr. Shea's arrival, a new roof was installed on the church, as well as new exterior doors. The stained glass windows were restored, and the Church Hall was upgraded. Saint Catherine of Siena School was completely refurbished, and a Pre-K classroom was added. In 1996, ‚ÄúProject Renovare‚Äù was undertaken, a major initiative of a liturgical renovation in the church, together with the addition of a side chapel. In 1998, a two-phased ‚ÄúProject H.O.P.E.‚Äù was unveiled, to prepare our parish for the next half-century. In 2000, the first phase of Project H.O.P.E. was completed as the Halloran Pastoral Center was dedicated, providing much-needed office and meeting space, together with secure storage space for parish records. On March 19, 2001, the Solemnity of Saint Joseph, the Most Reverend William E. Lori, until then an auxiliary bishop of Washington, was installed as the fourth Bishop of Bridgeport in ceremonies held at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield. The following day, at 7:30 a.m., Bishop Lori celebrated his first parish Mass in the Diocese of Bridgeport at Saint Catherine's. His parents, Frank and Margaret Lori, of Clarksville, Indiana, who were still in Connecticut for the Installation celebrations, were among the attendees. Also in 2001, the parish embarked on the second phase of Project H.O.P.E., called ‚ÄúFaith in God ‚Äì Faith in Families.‚Äù This campaign made possible the construction of the McClinch Family Center, a large and beautiful event space for parish meetings and social events. In May, 2011, Msgr. Shea celebrated the 50th anniversary of his priestly ordination with a Mass of Thanksgiving at Saint Catherine's, which was attended by Bishop Lori. Three years later, on the occasion of his retirement from active ministry, a grateful parish presented Msgr. Shea with a new car, together with a specially crafted Altar, for his use in the celebration of daily Mass in his retirement. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in April, 2016, Msgr. Shea returned to St. Catherine's for a celebratory Mass, during which the Marian Prayer Garden on the church grounds was dedicated in his honor. New Beginnings On September 19, 2013, the Most Reverend Frank J. Caggiano, until then an auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn, was installed as the fifth Bishop of Bridgeport, during a Mass celebrated at Saint Theresa Church in Trumbull. The receptions before and after his Installation Mass were held at the McClinch Family Center, here at Saint Catherine's. These receptions were attended by thousands of the faithful and other honored guests, by hundreds of priests from the Dioceses of Bridgeport and Brooklyn and beyond, and by over thirty bishops, including the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, the Most Reverend Carlo Maria Vigan√≤. Soon after arriving in the Diocese of Bridgeport, Bishop Caggiano convoked a diocesan Synod to plan for the pastoral and ministerial future of the diocese. We are honored that the working sessions of the Synod were held in the McClinch Family Center at Saint Catherine of Siena Parish. On March 15, 2015, Father Joseph A. Marcello was installed as the fifth Pastor of Saint Catherine of Siena Parish. An alumnus of Saint Catherine of Siena School, Father Marcello is beginning his pastorate at a time of great hope in the life of the Parish and of the Diocese.

The town of Kurwai was founded by Mohammed Diler Khan in 1715. The state was 368 km¬≤ in area and had a population of 30,631 in 1892. History Kurwai State was founded in 1713 by Mohammed Diler Khan, an Afghan soldier in the Mughal army. The state came under the Maratha suzerainty in the 1730s. Kurwai later became a British protectorate in 1818, following the British victory in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Its last ruler acceded to the Dominion of India on 15 June 1948. = Rulers = The ruling house of Kurwai was founded by Muhammad Diler Khan, an Afghan Pashtun from the Orakzai tribe as a feudal state. Diler Khan was a contemporary and cousin of Nawab Dost Muhammad Khan of Bhopal. In 1737, Marathas under the leadership of Peshwa Baji Rao I, defeated the forces of the Mughals and the Nawab of Bhopal in the Battle of Bhopal. Following the victory of the Marathas, Bhopal came under the suzerainty of the Maratha Empire as a semi-autonomous state and remained so until the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818. In the 1740s, Kurwai, then a feudal state, came under the direct rule of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire. Source In 1761, Diler Khan's son Izzat Khan formed an alliance with the Marathas, and fought for them at the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761. The Marathas suffered a defeat in the battle, and Diler Khan was badly wounded in action. He was rescued by his maternal uncle. After recovering, Izzat Khan joined enemy camp, and received high commands, titles and territories from Ahmad Shah Abdali. He died of the battle injuries after returning to Kurwai. Izzat Khan's son Hurmut Khan was imprisoned by the Marathas for three years. He was freed after he ceded several villages to them, and agreed to an indemnity of 3 lakhs rupees to the Marathas. Hurmut Khan' son Akbar Mohammad Khan formed an alliance with the British in hopes of gaining back his territory from the Marathas, but following the Second Anglo-Maratha War, the British annexed the recovered lands for themselves and Kurwai became a princely state under the British suzerainty. Hurmut Khan's successors ruled the state until 1887, when Najaf Khan died without any male heir; his elder brother Muzaffar Khan had also died without heir. After a brief struggle with the Nawab of Basoda, Najaf Khan's maternal grandson Munawar Ali Khan became the ruler of the princely state. After Munawar Khan died without issue, his younger brother Yaqub 'Ali Khan became the Nawab of Kurwai. Yaqub married Munawar's wife Umar un-nisa. Their four-year-old son Sarwar Ali Kan became the Nawab after Yaqub's death in an accident at Bhopal.  Sarwar Ali Khan  When Sarwar Ali Khan was young, the state was ruled by a regency council headed by Umar un-nisa, who came to be known as \\"Sarkar Amma\\" (Mother Governor). She established several institutions for welfare of the citizens, including a rural bank that provided interest-free loans. Sarwar Ali Khan and his sisters were the first generation in the family to receive English education. He studied at the Daly College (Indore), Mayo College (Ajmer) and the Sandhurst Military Academy. After graduating from Sandhurst in 1921, he severed with the Worcestershires until 1923. During this stint, he guarded Mahatma Gandhi in the British custody. In 1926, he married Abida Sultan, the eldest daughter and heiress presumptive of the Nawab of Bhopal. Their only son, Shaharyar Khan, was born in 1934. The marriage eventually failed, and Sarwar Ali later married other women. Abida Sultan gave up her right to the throne of Bhopal and opted for the Muslim nation Pakistan in 1950, eventually entering that country's Foreign service. Later, Shaharyar Khan became the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and then the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. Sarwar Ali Khan's second wife was Ayesha, daughter of the Nawab of Wai. They had three children: Kaiser Zaman, Zafar Ali Khan and Munawar Ali Khan. During Sarwar Ali Khan's reign, Kurwai saw development of modern infrastructure including roads, telephone network, sanitary facilities, bridges, schools, courts, police station, civil hospital government offices, a power station and a Legislative Assembly. The power was transferred to the Government of newly independent India in 1947. On 15 June 1948, Kurwai State officially acceded to the Indian Government. Kurwai became part of the newly created state of Madhya Bharat, and was added to Vidisha District. Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956. Sarwar Ali Khan continued to be involved in the political process. A friend of the Harijan leader Jagjeevan Ram, he encouraged the emancipation of the lower castes, and also campaigned against the dowry system and forced marriage. After his death in 1986, the title Nawab of Kurwai passed on to his son Zafar Ali Khan. Sawar Ali's daughter Kaiser Zaman studied English at Somerville College, Oxford University. She later founded the All Saints School Bhopal and the All Saints College of Science & Commerce. =List of Nawabs= Rulers of Kurwai State bore the title of 'Nawab'.

FMD was first confirmed on 5 January 2011, in a wild boar that had been shot on 30 December 2010. This animal is believed to have crossed the Bulgarian-Turkish border near the village of Kosti, Burgas Province in the Strandzha Mountains. A necropsy revealed foot-and mouth disease. Following this, 37 infected animals were discovered in the village of Kosti, and all susceptible livestock there were culled. Burgas Province and seven other neighbouring provinces declared a quarantine. On 14 January a new outbreak was suspected in the neighbouring village of Rezovo. It is believed to have been carried by a Turkish cattle herd. On 17 January the presence of the disease was confirmed. The Bulgarian authorities ordered culling of all susceptible livestock in Rezovo. The losses in the two villages are promised to be compensated. The mayor of Tsarevo Municipality Petko Arnaudov proposed construction of a wire fence along the Turkish border to prevent further movement of diseased animals into Bulgaria. The proposal was accepted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The authorities ordered disinfection of all vehicles crossing from Turkey, where a major outbreak was occurring. On 31 January in the village of Gramatikovo, Malko Tarnovo Municipality, which is located in the 10 km prevention zone around the first two outbreaks, a new outbreak was discovered. The blood tests found 13 animals infected with the disease. The authorities ordered culling of all susceptible livestock in the village, which consists of 149 animals - 1 cow, 38 sheep and 110 goats. The losses are promised to be compensated. On 25 March two new outbreaks were discovered in the villages of Granichar and Kirovo. The authorities ordered culling of 173 infected animals.

They were superseded in Training Circular 3-21.60. Hand and Arm signals are one of the most common forms of communication used by United States Army soldiers or group of soldiers when a radio silence is in effect or if the soldiers need to remain undetected. Through the use of these signals military leaders, such as team leaders, squad leaders and platoon leaders, are able to keep command and control (C2) over their particular element. All new recruits are taught to use the proper hand and arm signals found in the FM. However, it is not uncommon for units to adopt and/or create their own signals. These signals ultimately become known as SOP or standard operating procedure. Visual signals are any means of communication that require sight and can be used to transmit prearranged messages rapidly over short distances. This includes the devices and means used for recognition and identification of friendly forces.  Types of visual signals  There are a number of ways that visual communication can be executed. The most common types are: hand and arm signals, flags, pyrotechnic, chemical-lights and ground-to-air signals. It must be known that soldiers and units are not limited to this select list. Soldiers are only limited in their choice of visual communication by their initiative and imagination, as well as the ability of others to understand what they are trying to convey.  Limitations  Like all other types of signals, visual signals do have their downfalls and limitations. The first limitation one can see is the range and reliability. Within this limitation, visual communication can become greatly disrupted during periods of poor visibility or when the terrain restricts clear observation. The second limitation one can see is misunderstanding. Many units do not follow specific Army doctrine (FM), but rather adopt their own SOP's. With thousands of different units, it is highly likely that unit SOP's will begin to overlap and cross each other. The third limitation one can see is how vulnerable visual signals are to enemy interception; thus allowing the enemy to use our own signals for deception purposes. Signals for combat formations The ground hand signal: \\"Ready to fire: clear and ready to fire, indicated by pointing down range.\\" Leaders of dismounted units use arm and hand signals to control the movement of individuals, teams, and squads. These signals are used by infantry and also by combat support and combat service support elements organized for infantry missions. Leaders of mounted units use arm and hand signals to control individual vehicles and platoon movement. When distances between vehicles increase, flags (wrapped and tied) can be used as an extension of the arm to give the signals. From some vehicles (for example, Bradley, M2), the arm and hand signals will be distorted.

After a couple of years, finding himself working twelve-hour days and often weekends, Padovan realized the career was not for him: \\"I've always loved films, I own myself probably 2000 DVDs, but back in Italy I never thought I could have been part of it.\\" One night, after seeing a Woody Allen film at the cinema, he was inspired and the next morning enroled in an eight-week course in film directing at the New York Film Academy instead of going to work. Despite this, the firm continued to give him projects, and he began to divide his time between architecture and wandering Manhattan with a camera on his shoulder; at the end of the program, after completing Socks and Cakes he received a full scholarship to come back for another year. Reception Padovan's first short film impressed not only his professors, but also the judges at the 2010 Las Vegas film festival, where it won a Golden Ace Award.

Two were built for the United States Army Air Service in 1922, but after competing in the 1922 Pulitzer Trophy Race the type was abandoned. Design and development In early 1922, the United States Army Air Service placed orders with a number of American manufacturers for Racing aircraft to compete in the prestigious Pulitzer Trophy Race. Amongst the companies who received orders was Thomas- Morse Aircraft of Ithaca, New York, whose chief designer, B Douglas Thomas, designed a single-seat, single-engined parasol wing monoplane, the Thomas Morse TM-22, with two being ordered by the Army as the Thomas-Morse R-5.Wegg 1990, p. 27.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, pp. 423‚Äì424. The TM-22, which was based on Thomas's unsuccessful MB-9 fighter and MB-10 training aircraft, which had both flown in 1921 but had been quickly abandoned. It was of all-metal construction, with corrugated duralumin skinning over a duralumin structure, while its wing featured a distinct hump in the centre above the fuselage.Flight 19 October 1922, p. 605. The two prototypes had different wings, with the first prototype having a span of 29 ft 0 in (8.84 m) and a wing area of 174 sq ft (16.2 m¬≤), while the second had a span of 25 ft (7.62 m) and an area of 150 sq dt (13.9 m¬≤). It was powered by a single 600 hp (447 kW) Packard 1A-2025 V12 engine with its radiator and oil tank in a tubular container beneath the fuselage. The aircraft had a fixed conventional landing gear. Operational history Thomas-Morse R-5 and Clayton Bissell - note the corrogated fuselage skin of the aircraft The two aircraft were delivered to Selfridge Field, Michigan in September 1922, with the first prototype making its maiden flight there on 29 September. The aircraft suffered cooling problems and had poor handling, while struggling to reach the speed of 190 mph expected by the Air Service. Despite these problems, the two R-5s, flown by Captain Frank O'Driscoll Hunter and Lieutenant Clayton L. Bissell were amongst the starters for the Pulitzer Race on 14 October. Bissell finished tenth at an average speed of 155.5 mph (250.4 km/h), while Hunter finish eleventh, at a speed of 149.3 mph (240.4 km/h), the last two aircraft to complete the race.

Background Gerry Adams had held Belfast West for Sinn F√©in from 1983 to 1992, and continuously since 1997.Gerry Adams resigns as West Belfast MP BBC News At the 1992 UK general election and in the 1974 and 1979 elections, the seat was won instead by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), an Irish nationalist party, but by the 2010 general election, they were a long way behind Adams, the seat being the safest in Northern Ireland and the fourth safest anywhere in the UK. A constituency of the same name, with boundaries identical to the Westminster constituency which existed before the 2010 election, was contested at the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election, using the single transferable vote method of election. Sinn F√©in candidates won five of the six seats and the SDLP the other.West Belfast 2007, Northern Ireland Elections In 2010, the two main unionist parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), both stood candidates in the seat, but took only 10.7% of the vote between them. The DUP did hold one of the six Assembly seats until 2007.West Belfast, Northern Ireland Elections Although the UUP have not held their deposit in recent years, they held the Parliamentary seat until 1966.West Belfast 1950‚Äì1970, Northern Ireland Elections Vacation of the seat Members of the House of Commons, whether or not they have taken their seats, cannot resign in form, but a legal fiction has grown up to allow Members to resign in effect. Under Section 4 of the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, if an MP wishes to vacate their seat, they can request appointment to either of two 'offices of profit under the Crown' which disqualify them from membership. As an Irish republican, Gerry Adams considered a British Crown appointment politically unacceptable, and therefore submitted a letter resigning his seat to the Speaker of the House of Commons on 20 January 2011; he maintained that by doing so he had simply resigned.Adams comments on Cameron claims Sinnfein.ie Notwithstanding that he had not requested it, Adams was on 26 January appointed as Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead, a Treasury spokesperson explaining that this appointment had been made \\"consistent with long-standing precedent\\". Although David Cameron said during Prime Minister's Questions that Adams had \\"accepted an office for profit under the Crown\\", Adams denied this and received an apology from the Prime Minister's Office for not informing him of the procedure and for stating that he had applied for the \\"post\\". Calling the by-election In order for a by- election to take place, an MP makes a motion in the House of Commons to the Speaker to issue a warrant to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, who then issues the writ ordering that the election take place. Traditionally, the MP comes from the same party as the member that has stood down. However, because Sinn F√©in MPs do not take their seats in the Commons, the writ was moved by the Government Chief Whip, Conservative Patrick McLoughlin MP on 16 May 2011. Candidates Alex Attwood, the Environment Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, and the Social Democratic and Labour Party's candidate for the seat at the 2010 general election was the SDLP candidate for the by-election. Brian Kingston was the Democratic Unionist Party candidate.‚Äì DUP Nomination for West Belfast by-election, 24 May 2011 Paul Maskey, a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, won the Sinn F√©in nomination. Danny Morrison, the former publicity director of Sinn F√©in, had suggested that the party should stand aside and instead back a candidacy for former Respect Party MP George Galloway.Martina Purdy, \\"Galloway to run for West Belfast?\\", BBC News, 21 January 2011 Results =By-election= =Previous General Election= See also *1903 Belfast West by-election *1943 Belfast West by-election *1950 Belfast West by-election *List of United Kingdom by-elections *Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election References  External links  *A Vision Of Britain Through Time (Constituency elector numbers) *Northern Ireland Elections Belfast West by-election Belfast West by-election Belfast West by-election West Category:2010s in Northern Ireland Category:21st century in Belfast Category:2010s elections in Northern Ireland ","title":"2011 Belfast West by-election"},{"id":"30547404","text":"Sixty-first volume of One Piece, released in Japan by Shueisha on February 4, 2011 One Piece is a sh≈çnen manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda that has been translated into various languages and spawned a substantial media franchise.

The film premiered in competition at the 61st Berlin International Film Festival and competed for the Golden Bear. Marston and co-writer Andamion Murataj won the Silver Bear for Best Script. The film was originally submitted as the Albanian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film, but it was rejected when Bujar Alimani, director of Amnesty, protested that The Forgiveness of Blood ought not to be eligible due to American input on the project. The AMPAS disqualified it and Albania submitted Alimani's film instead. The film deals with the consequences of a blood feud on a family in a remote area of modern-day Albania. Cast * Refet Abazi as Mark, who incites a blood feud by killing his neighbour Sokol. * Veton Osmani as Sokol, the neighbour Mark kills in a dispute over a field. * Tristan Halilaj as Nik, Mark's 17-year-old son. * as Rudina, Mark's 14-year-old daughter. * Erjon Mani as Tom, 17-year-old friend of Nik. Plot After their father and uncle are suspected of murdering a neighbor because of a land dispute, the lives of the children are changed. Nik, the teenage son, is confined to the house, while Rudina, the oldest girl, is forced to quit high school and take over the family's bread delivery business. The film contrasts the modernization of rural Albania, where the teenagers text each other and Nik dreams of opening an internet cafe, with centuries-old customs. Reception The film earned an 84% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.22/10 based on 69 reviews. Cultural background The Kanun is a traditional code of behavior that is followed rarely today in Albania, most notably in the northern highlands in deep mountains when people are stuck in the past traditions, which authorizes an eye-for-an-eye response in event of murder. According to the Kanun, the family of a murdered person should kill a member of the murderer's family. Although traditionally only adult males are at risk, there have been instances where females or children have been killed. The revenge killing can only take place outside of the person's home, so at- risk males are often confined to home while females become the sole support of the family.

Project HOME works to achieve this mission through a continuum of care, which provides individuals a range of supportive services suited to their particular degree of self-sufficiency. The work of Project HOME is rooted in a belief in \\"the dignity of each person\\" and \\"the transformational power of building relationships and community\\". Project HOME is a vision-centered organization that believes \\"none of us are home until all of us are home\\". History =Co-founders and beginnings= Sister Mary Scullion and Joan Dawson McConnon co-founded Project HOME in 1989. Their work together began in the winter of 1988, when they opened a temporary shelter in a vacant recreation center donated by the City of Philadelphia benefitting chronically homeless men . With start-up funds from the Connelly Foundation, Scullion and McConnon were able to expand their efforts and found Project HOME the following year. =1515 Fairmount: creating legal precedent and permanent housing= Project HOME gained national recognition for its four-year political and legal battle to open a residence for formerly homeless individuals at 1515 Fairmount Avenue. Though the property's zoning permit was secured from the project's onset in 1990, neighborhood associations slowed the development process when they sought to overturn the building permit in the courts. With the issue still unresolved in December 1992, the U.S. Justice Department sued the City of Philadelphia, on behalf of Project HOME, for violation of Fair Housing laws, which required the City to provide reasonable modifications in the building permits for the people with mental and physical disabilities who would live at 1515 Fairmount. As the case continued in the court system, Project HOME undertook substantial acts of advocacy to attract media attention including community petitions and a vigil outside the Mayor's office that ended in 23 arrests for civil disobedience. After several steps in the appeals process, the final verdict came from a U.S. Court of Appeals in June 1994. The court ruled in favor of Project HOME and \\"reasonable accommodation\\". 1515 Fairmount is now home to a 48-unit single room occupancy facility. Programs =Street outreach= In partnership with the City and other service providers, Project HOME's Outreach Coordination Center (OCC) oversees all outreach to people living on the streets of Philadelphia. Response workers attempt to build long-term, trusting relationships with people experiencing homelessness and gradually lead them toward seeking help. Outreach teams work almost around the clock, seven days per week, with additional teams out during summer and winter weather emergencies. =Housing= Project HOME provides a range of supportive housing for all phases of recovery including safe havens, transitional housing and permanent supportive housing. The level of supportive services, such as case management and on-site medical care, varies based on individual need. Project HOME believes that more affordable, permanent housing is the most cost-effective solution to ending chronic homelessness. =Employment initiatives= The Adult Learning and Workforce Development program engages residents with employment services including job readiness clubs, career fairs, resume writing classes, dress for success workshops, customer service training and job placement with community partners.Project HOME, \\"Adult Learning & Workforce Development\\", 2006, {http://www.projecthome.org/services/education/adult.php}, 09-01-10 Project HOME also sponsors employment experience for youth in North Central Philadelphia. The John and Sheila Connors Youth Employment Program sponsors summer internships for neighborhood teens in Project HOME offices and other community offices and the Harold A. Honickman Young Entrepreneurs Program gives teens the opportunity to create and run their own small businesses. Project HOME also provides some residents with employment experience at its small businesses: Our Daily Threads thrift store and the HOME Page Caf√©. The Caf√©, located in the lobby of the Central Branch of the Free Library of Philadelphia, is a partnership between Project HOME, the Free Library and Bank of America. It serves Starbucks coffee and baked goods from Metropolitan Bakery. The Free Library also employs Project HOME residents through the Library Restroom Attendants program, in which employees perform light cleaning and maintenance and provide information about homeless services to anyone in need. =Educational resources= Opened in December 2003, the Honickman Learning Center and Comcast Technology Labs is a educational facility in North Central Philadelphia featuring 225 computers, high-tech meeting spaces and Smart Boards in each classroom. The Learning Center is home to an after-school program with comprehensive literacy instruction; a resource center for grandparents raising children; GED and basic technology classes; digital media, art and music instruction;Honickman Foundation, \\"The Honickman Learning Center and Comcast Technology Labs: A Project HOME Initiative opens for business\\", 2004-2010, {http://honickmanfoundation.org/education/HOME.php} 09-01-10 and the Community Partnership School, an independent grade school for neighborhood children run by Germantown Academy in partnership with Project HOMECommunity Partnership School, \\"Partnerships\\", 2007-2009, {http://www.communitypartnershipschool.org/Partnerships/138/} 09-01-10 =Advocacy= Project HOME seeks to ensure that all members of its community have a voice in the political process. The organization helps and encourages residents to advocate for themselves and educate policy makers about the issues of poverty, homelessness, mental illness and addiction. Project HOME's successful advocacy initiatives include the 1515 Fairmount legal battle, the Vote for Homes Coalition, a campaign that trains volunteers to register homeless and low-income voters, and the 1998 negotiation of the Sidewalk Behavior Ordinance. As a result of activism by the homeless advocacy community, Philadelphia City Council passed a version of the ordinance that did not criminalize living on the streets; required police to contact an outreach worker before issuing a citation to a homeless person; and provided additional funding for the Outreach Coordination Center and supportive housing. Recognition and awards Project HOME's work has been recognized as a model for ending homelessness by news organizations across the country including The New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Denver Post, and The Philadelphia Inquirer. U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan has stated that the work of Sister Mary Scullion in Philadelphia exemplifies supportive housing as a good investment more \\"than anywhere else in the country\\".

The parish is considered the Mother Church of Trumbull and is the largest in town with over 3,100 parishioner families.  History  The Saint Theresa Parish was originally created on October 4, 1934 by Bishop Maurice F. McAuliffe of Hartford. Aware of the spiritual needs of the people of Trumbull, the Bishop made Saint Theresa's the first Catholic Church in town, and dedicated it in honor of Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, the Little Flower of Jesus. Bishop McAuliffe dedicated the original small white frame church on September 22, 1935 so that Saint Theresa's functioned as a true parish. The original church was a classic New England colonial design that could seat some four hundred people, and the neighboring McLevy homestead became the parish rectory. In 1960, Bishop Lawrence J. Shehan gave permission to construct the present cathedral-like granite and limestone church building, which was dedicated by Bishop Walter W. Curtis on April 1, 1962. The parish celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 2009 and received a letter of congratulations from Bishop Lori.http://216.47.165.199/homily.10.3.09.shtml On October 1, 2017 the parish dedicated Our Lady of F√°tima Chapel for perpetual Eucharistic adoration. The chapel is open twenty-four hours per day, seven days a week. Music The parish has an established traditional church music program. The choir is composed of approximately 35 singers, including four professional section leaders (SATB). The choir sings high quality literature ranging from Gregorian chant and polyphony through 21st century repertoire. Instruments include a three-manual 38 rank Peragallo pipe organ with 7 additional Walker electronic stops, mainly in the Pedal division. Adjacent to the organ is a Yamaha concert grand piano. The organ is frequently used as a concert instrument and is featured in a 1999 compact disk of French organ works performed by internationally famous organist Stephen Tharp.http://www.stephentharp.com/html/showcase.php?showcase=1&page;=2 Stephen Tharp recording at St. Theresa Church, Trumbull CT It was also a feature instrument in the 2010 Pipe Organ Encounter program of the Bridgeport Chapter of the American Guild of Organists.http://www.agoevents.org/assets/files/downloads/PIPE%20ORGAN%20ENCOUNTER%202010.pdf Pipe Organ Encounters Saint Theresa's Church has been a regular site for Connecticut Chamber Choir concerts.

The video went viral, partly due to support from Reddit and Philip DeFranco (Watsky's music can be heard in the background of DeFranco's news series and SourceFed channel). It accumulated four million views within two days, and eventually exceeded 25 million views despite later being unlisted by Watsky and the title being changed to \\"Watsky raps fast.\\" He performed a slightly modified version of the rap on The Ellen DeGeneres Show one week later. Being able to match the speed of the song's rapping was viewed as an Internet challenge, spawning covers by fellow rappers such as Mac Lethal, and YouTube celebrities such as Hank Green and Bry. 2012: Nothing Like The First Time and tour On June 10, 2012, Watsky released a free mixtape entitled Nothing Like The First Time. The mixtape coincided with his first official tour of the same name beginning in July, featuring his touring band Cr√©me Fra√Æche, with support from Dumbfoundead.

Tax expenditures alter the horizontal and vertical equity of the basic tax system by allowing exemptions, deductions, or credits to select groups or specific activities. For example, two people who earn exactly the same income can have different effective tax rates if one of the tax payers qualifies for certain tax expenditure programs by owning a home, having children, and receiving employer health care and pension insurance.  The history of tax expenditures  In 1967, the tax expenditure concept was created by Stanley S. Surrey, former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, as a way to represent the political use of tax breaks for means that were usually accomplished through budget spending. Secretary Surrey argued that members of Congress were using tax policy as a \`\`vast subsidy apparatus to reward favored constituencies or subsidize narrow policy areas.Surrey 1973, p. 6 The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Act of 1974 (CBA) defines tax expenditures as \\"those revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability\\" (Surrey 1985). They are equally common in other countries.Christian M.A. Valenduc, Hana Polackova Brixi, Zhicheng Li Swift: Tax Expenditures - Shedding Light on Government Spending Through the Tax System: Lessons from Developed and Transition Economies; World Bank Publications, 31 Jan 2003  The process of tax expenditures  The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation (hereafter JCT) annually estimates tax expenditures in terms of revenues lost to the U.S. Treasury for each special tax provision included in the U.S. tax code. In 2009, the JCT listed over 180 tax expenditure programs that cost the U.S. government over $1 trillion in revenues. Their cost varies with the level of economic activity.Thomas L. Hungerford: Tax Expenditures and the Federal Budget; Congressional Research Service, RL34622, 1 June 2011. A major tax expenditure is enjoyed by tax payers who own their own home and can deduct the interest on their mortgage payments. Since tax expenditures are claimed against a progressive tax code, individual tax expenditure programs are worth more to wealthier taxpayers. The majority of tax expenditure programs are targeted for private social benefits and services.Faricy 2011 The administration of tax expenditures falls on the IRS, and is not accounted for.  The politics of tax expenditures  Tax expenditures are considered \\"off- budget\\" spending by most economists and budget experts.Howard 1997 Tax expenditures are easier to pass through Congress than increases in appropriations spending. They are easily seen as free benefits, when government grants are viewed as giveaways.Leonard E. Burman: Is the Tax Expenditure Concept Still Relevant?; National Tax Journal, September 2003 Unlike direct spending, tax spending must only pass through two committees, the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance. Tax expenditure programs, once in the tax code, do not come up for annual review and can only be removed through tax legislation. Tax expenditure programs are a form of entitlement spending in that every tax payer that qualifies can claim government money. Faricy (2011) demonstrated that when tax expenditures are counted as a type of government spending, Democratic and Republican parties are indistinguishable in annual changes to federal government spending. This study also finds that Republicans are more likely to increase tax expenditures when in control of government thereby subsidizing the activities of businesses and the wealthy. Jacob Hacker (2002) shows that the federal subsidization of private health insurance has grown over the years and has made efforts for nationalized health care more difficult. Ellis and Faricy (2011) find that when tax expenditures rise, public opinion adjusts and becomes more liberal to counteract the conservative policies. The effect of tax expenditures Budgetary effects of largest tax expenditures 2017 to 2026, as an average annual percent of GDP Partial exemption of the poor from taxation through reliance on progressive income taxes rather than sales taxes for revenue or tax rebates such as the earned income tax credit loosely correlate with socio- economic mobility in the United States with areas which tax the poor heavily such as the Deep South showing lower mobility than those with generous tax expenditures for the benefit of low income families with children. =Size of expenditures in U.S.= A 2016 Congressional Budget Office report estimated that U.S. tax expenditures were expected to total $1.5 trillion in 2016; for scale, U.S. federal tax receipts were expected to be $3.3 trillion that year. CBO also estimated the size of major tax expenditures on federal receipts as an annual average percent of GDP, for the 2016 to 2026 periods. These included, among others: *Exclusions from income: Employment based health insurance (1.5% GDP) and pension contributions (1.2% GDP) *Deductions from income: State and local taxes (0.6% GDP) and mortgage interest (0.6% GDP) *Preferential (lower) tax rates: Capital gains and dividends (0.6% GDP) *Tax credits: Earned income tax credit (0.3% GDP) CBO projected that the top 10 largest tax expenditures would average 6.2% GDP each year on average over the 2016-2026 period. For scale, federal tax receipts averaged around 18% GDP from 1970 to 2016. The CBO analysis does not account for behavioral changes that might occur if the tax policies were changed, so the actual revenue impact would differ from the amounts indicated.CBO Budget & Economic Outlook 2016 to 2026-January 25, 2016-Pages 101 to 105 =Distribution of benefits in U.S.= According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), tax expenditures dis-proportionally benefit those with high incomes. CBPP estimated that the top 1% of U.S. households by income received approximately 17% of the tax expenditure benefits in 2013, while the top 20% received 51%.CBPP-Policy Basics-Federal Tax Expenditures-Updated February 23, 2016 The top 20% pay 84% of the federal income taxes; this figure does not include payroll taxes. For scale, 50% of the $1.5 trillion in tax expenditures in 2016 is $750 billion, while the U.S. budget deficit was approximately $600 billion. In other words, eliminating the tax expenditures for just the top 20% could theoretically balance the budget in the short-run, although economic effects from changing the incentives may reduce the impact on the deficit. CBO reported in January 2016 that: \\"Tax expenditures are distributed unevenly across the income scale. When measured in dollars, much more of the tax expenditures go to higher-income households than to lower-income households. As a percentage of people‚Äôs income, tax expenditures are greater for the highest-income and lowest-income households than for households in the middle of the income distribution.\\"CBO Budget & Economic Outlook 2016 to 2026-January 25, 2016-Pages 101 to 105 References Further reading * *Ellis, Christoper and Christopher Faricy. 2011.

In 1964, Dorfman joined Syntex full-time, eventually serving as president of Syntex Research in Palo Alto, California from 1973‚Äì1976. Dorfman's research also focused on treatments for cancer and rheumatoid arthritis and originated the reproductive biology concept of anti- estrogens and anti-androgens.

In 1984 the gallery found its first physical home on East Eleventh Street and showed the work of many East Village artists who went on to gain national recognition. It was an early proponent of installation art. Ground Zero served as the production name for many projects in various media undertaken by the team of Van Cook and Romberger, until the September 11 attacks gave a new meaning to the term \\"ground zero\\" in New York City. Early years Ground Zero opened its first gallery site in 1984.Engler, Brigitte \\"Breaking Ground\\". Paper Magazine, 5/84 It remained in this location until the following year, when it moved into a larger space on East Tenth Street facing Tompkins Square Park. Romberger and Van Cook presented and pioneered the concept of installations and multimedia environments and hosted many performance events. These included the premi√®re of Cinema of Transgression director Richard Kern‚Äôs You Killed Me First, featuring Karen Finley and David Wojnarowicz, which was part of an installation presented by David Wojnarowicz entitled Installation number 8. Other installations presented were Hell by Mike Osterhout, Zero Gravity by Dragan Ilichttp://www.draganilic.org/ and Cold War by Marguerite Van Cook.Reid, Calvin, \\"Marguerite Van Cook: Cold War\\". 108 Newsletter, 6 1985 The Gallery was also home to collaborative installations, such as The Nuclear Family curated by Carlo McCormick featuring the work of David West, Keiko Bonk, Andy Soma, David Wojnarowicz, James Romberger and Marguerite Van Cook.

Night club curation During the 1980s, the New York City nightclub scene provided the home for many alternative art installations. The Ground Zero team of Van Cook and Romberger curated many nightclub art shows, at venues such as Danceteria, Palace de Beaute, Kamikaze, The World and Max Fish. These shows included many other notable artists including: John Drury, Stephen Lack, Manuel De Landa, Joseph Nechvatal, Kiki Smith, Walter Robinson, Julius Klein, Nick Zedd, Thom Corn, Mark and Matt Enger, Conrad Vogel, Phoebe Legere, Cheryl Dyer, Selwyn Garaway. Comic The comic strip by the name of Ground Zero, written and drawn Romberger and Van Cook, is a semi-autobiographical, meta-narrative look at the authors‚Äô lives on the Lower East Side and beyond. In its inception, the comic was heavily influenced by the philosophy of Roland Barthes, deconstructionism and film- maker Jean Marie Straub. The strip/pages were conceptually designed to challenge the reader. Consequently, it was rarely printed in the same publication more than three times and experimented with diverse drawing styles, media and processes of printing.\\"Up Is Up But So Is Down, NY‚Äôs Downtown Literary Scene, 1974-1992\\".

History In late 1951 Air Defense Command selected this mountainous site near Thoreau, New Mexico as one of twenty-eight radar stations built as part of the second segment of the permanent radar surveillance network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the second segment of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. On 1 January 1951 the 769th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was activated at the site, designated as Gonzales, NM. The initial assignment of personnel was four officers and forty-three airmen. The radars consisted of AN/FPS-3 and AN/FPS-5 sets, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. On 1 December 1953, the site was renamed Continental Divide Air Force Station. Facilities on the station consisted of a multi-purpose building containing a Barbershop, a Day Room/Library, a Gymnasium with a single basketball backboard which doubled as an auditorium for Commander's Call, training lectures, and movies. An outdoor tennis court and also an Airman's barracks was constructed, along with a 16 place trailer park was also available. In 1955 an AN/FPS-4 height-finder radar was installed, only to be replaced a year later by an AN/FPS-6 model. At the end of 1960, this radar was transferred to the Federal Aviation Administration pending inactivation of the 769th on 1 July 1961 due to budget reductions. After the station was closed, the site was turned over to the General Services Administration for disposal. The United States Forest Service used the facilities until 1974 when it was provided to the Bureau of Indian Affairs for their use. In December 1985 the site was closed and the five buildings remaining on the site were torn down, the site restored to a natural state. Today, what once was Continental Divide AFS has been razed. The streets of the station remain, and a few buildings are in very decrepit condition. It has largely returned to the elements.

The full-length feature film is akin to real life events that happened at a truck stop. It was distinguished due to its adoption of environmental and socially acceptable settings, which has won recognition by the Sustainable Style Foundation with a SSF Tag award. The film was premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah on January 22, 2011. Plot The official website describes the film: \\"In The Off Hours, Amy Seimetz alluringly commands the screen as Francine, a waitress whose liberation from her mundane existence is long overdue. In the restless world of the night shift at a highway diner, Francine's life consists of casual encounters and transient friendships. What she wants is out of reach‚Äîor is it that she's lost track of wanting anything at all? When a banker turned big-rig driver becomes a regular, he sparks hope in Francine. As change begins to invade the quiet diner, Francine is reminded that it is never too late to become the person she was meant to be.\\" Production Griffiths, the film's writer and director, was inspired to begin writing this story after spending several months working the night shift at a film lab in 2003. Griffiths has worked on set in many capacities, from producer to cinematographer to assistant director. She noticed that those employees who worked the night shift seemed to have similar personality traits. The script thus evolved from her interest in the night shift culture. Fund raising for the film began in 2007. The film was shot in Seattle in Burien, South Park and Georgetown with many local enthusiasts supporting Griffiths. The Off Hours was the first film to receive the \\"SSF Tag\\" from the Sustainable Style Foundation, an organization that promotes environmentally friendly practices. The film was able to meet the demands for the SSF Tag by using second-hand furniture for set design and second-hand clothes for costume design. The film was also shot digitally, which avoids the toxic materials found in traditional film. Release The film premiered at the 27th Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2011 in NEXT, a non-competition category focusing on low-budget, independent filmmaking.

Garrick Speaking the Jubilee, engraving by Caroline Watson after Robert Edge Pine (1784, Metropolitan Museum of Art). The Shakespeare Jubilee was staged in Stratford-upon-Avon between 6 and 8 September 1769. The jubilee was organised by the actor and theatre manager David Garrick to celebrate the Jubilee of the birth of William Shakespeare. It had a major impact on the rising tide of bardolatry that led to Shakespeare's becoming established as the English national poet. Thomas Arne composed the song Soft Flowing Avon for the Jubilee. Stratford was at the time a town with around 2,200 inhabitants. Garrick, Britain's most famous Shakespearean actor and most influential theatre owner-manager, had the idea for the Jubilee when he was approached by the town's leaders who wanted him to fund a statue of Shakespeare to stand in the Town Hall. Garrick planned a major celebration with major figures from London's cultural, political and economic world attending. He oversaw the construction of a large rotunda, based on that in Ranelagh Gardens in London, which could hold 1,000 spectators. \\"It is difficult to exaggerate how much space in the papers in the weeks and months beforehand was devoted to discussion of the Jubilee, announcing details of the program, advertising various accoutrements, reporting progress, speculating about its form, and attacking it.\\" The Jubilee opened on 6 September with the firing of thirty cannons and the ringing of church bells. Various events were held to commemorate Shakespeare's life. It drew in many people from fashionable society, or who were involved in the London theatre. There were seven hundred people at the dinner on the first day. On the second day bad weather began to disrupt the proceedings and flooded parts of the Rotunda when the banks of the River Avon broke. The highlights of the second day were the unveiling of the new statue at the Town Hall and a masquerade held in the evening. Another notable event from the second day of the Jubilee was a speech by Garrick thanking the Shakespeare Ladies Club for making Shakespeare popular again and for their contribution to the memorial statue of Shakespeare in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. The third day was to have seen a grand Shakespeare Pageant but the heavy rain forced this to be cancelled. Garrick later staged the Pageant in the Drury Lane Theatre with the music of Charles Dibdin where it was a success, running for ninety performances. It was the first jubilee celebration of the life of Shakespeare, although it was held more than five years after the bicentenary of his birth in April 1564. In spite of the impact it had on the rising popularity of Shakespeare and his works, none of his plays were performed during the Jubilee. A recording of Dibdin's The Jubilee, also including Queen Mab (which was performed on the first day of Garrick's festival) and Datchet Mead, was released in 2019 featuring the singer Simon Butteriss and the keyboardist Stephen Higgins.

Thereupon, by a letter from King James I, Arnot became Lord Balfour of Burleigh, the second holder of the title.

He was also constituted of the privy council ad vitam aut culpam by the parliament of Scotland 11 November 1641. During the wars of Montrose he was energetic on the side of the government. He assumed military command, but was not successful. Montrose defeated him 12 September 1644 near Aberdeen, and again (with General Baillie) at Kilsyth, 15 August 1645. He was opposed to the celebrated and unfortunate 'engagement' to march into England for the rescue of the king. He had weight enough to dissuade Cromwell then from the invasion of Scotland. In 1649, under the act for putting 'the kingdom in a posture of defence,' he was one of the colonels for Fife.

In a unanimous ruling, the court held that habeas relief may not be granted with respect to any claim a state-court has found on the merits unless the state-court decision denying relief involves an \\"unreasonable application\\" of \\"clearly established federal law, as determined by\\" the Court.https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/09-658.ZS.html  Background  Respondent Moore and two accomplices attacked a man, tied him up, and threw him in the trunk of a car before driving into the Oregon countryside, where Moore fatally shot him. Afterwards, Moore and one accomplice told Moore's brother and the accomplice's girlfriend that they had intended to scare Rogers, but that Moore had accidentally shot him. Moore and the accomplice repeated this account to the police. On the advice of counsel, Moore agreed to plead no contest to felony murder in exchange for the minimum sentence for that offense. He later sought postconviction relief in state court, claiming that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel. Moore complained that his lawyer had not moved to suppress his confession to police in advance of the lawyer's advice that Moore considered before accepting the plea offer. The court concluded the suppression motion would have been fruitless in light of Moore's other admissible confession to two witnesses. Counsel gave that as his reason for not making the motion. He added that he had advised Moore that, because of the abuse Rogers suffered before the shooting, Moore could be charged with aggravated murder. That crime was punishable by death or life in prison without parole. These facts led the state court to conclude Moore had not established ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland v. Washington (1984). Moore sought federal habeas relief, renewing his ineffective-assistance claim. The District Court denied the petition, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court's conclusion was an unreasonable application of clearly established law in light of Strickland and was contrary to Arizona v.

Other variants include enthalpy wheels and desiccant wheels. A cooling-specific thermal wheel is sometimes referred to as a Kyoto wheel. Description A thermal wheel consists of a circular honeycomb matrix of heat-absorbing material, which is slowly rotated within the supply and exhaust air streams of an air-handling system. As the thermal wheel rotates, heat is captured from the exhaust air stream in one half of the rotation and released to the fresh air stream in the other half of the rotation. Thus waste heat energy from the exhaust air stream is transferred to the matrix material and then from the matrix material to the fresh air stream. This increases the temperature of the supply air stream by an amount proportional to the temperature differential between air streams, or \\"thermal gradient\\" and depending upon the efficiency of the device. Heat exchange is most efficient when the streams flow in opposite directions, since this causes a favourable temperature gradient across the thickness of the wheel. The principle works in reverse, and \\"cooling\\" energy can be recovered to the supply air stream if desired and the temperature differential allows. The heat exchange matrix may be aluminium, plastic, or synthetic fiber. The heat exchanger is rotated by a small electric motor and belt drive system. The motors are often inverter speed-controlled for improved control of the exiting air temperature. If no heat exchange is required, the motor can be stopped altogether. Because heat is transferred from the exhaust air stream to the supply air stream without passing directly through an exchange medium, the gross efficiencies are usually higher than any other air-side heat recovery system. The shallower depth of the heat exchange matrix, as compared to a plate heat exchanger, means that the pressure drop through the device is normally lower in comparison. Generally, a thermal wheel will be selected for face velocities between , and with equal air volume flow rates, gross \\"sensible\\" efficiencies of 85% can be expected. Although there is a small energy requirement to rotate the wheel, the motor energy consumption is usually low and has little effect upon the seasonal efficiency of the device. The ability to recover \\"latent\\" heat can improve gross efficiencies by 10‚Äì15%. Energy transfer process Normally the heat transfer between airstreams provided by the device is termed as \\"sensible\\", which is the exchange of energy, or enthalpy, resulting in a change in temperature of the medium (air in this case), but with no change in moisture content. However, if moisture or relative humidity levels in the return air stream are high enough to allow condensation to take place in the device, then this will cause \\"latent\\" heat to be released, and the heat transfer material will be covered with a film of water. Despite a corresponding absorption of latent heat, as some of the water film is evaporated in the opposite air stream, the water will reduce the thermal resistance of the boundary layer of the heat exchanger material and thus improve the heat transfer coefficient of the device, and hence increase efficiency. The energy exchange of such devices now comprises both sensible and latent heat transfer; in addition to a change in temperature, there is also a change in moisture content of the air streams. However, the film of condensation will also slightly increase pressure drop through the device, and depending upon the spacing of the matrix material, this can increase resistance by up to 30%. This will increase fan energy consumption and reduce the seasonal efficiency of the device. Aluminium matrices are also available with an applied hygroscopic coating, and the use of this, or the use of porous synthetic fiber matrices, allows for the adsorption and release of water vapour, at moisture levels much lower than that normally required for condensation and latent heat transfer to occur. The benefit of this is an even higher heat transfer efficiency, but it also results in the drying or humidification of air streams, which may also be desired for the particular process being served by the supply air. For this reason these devices are also commonly known as an enthalpy wheel. =Use in gas turbines= During the automotive industry's interest in gas turbines for vehicle propulsion (around 1965), Chrysler invented a unique type of rotary heat exchangerChrysler turbine information that consisted of a rotary drum constructed from corrugated metal (similar in appearance to corrugated cardboard). This drum was continuously rotated by reduction gears driven by the turbine. The hot exhaust gasses were directed through a portion of the device, which would then rotate to a section that conducted the induction air, where this intake air was heated. This recovery of the heat of combustion significantly increased the efficiency of the turbine engine. This engine proved impractical for an automotive application due to its poor low-rpm torque. Even such an efficient engine, if large enough to deliver the proper performance, would have a low average fuel efficiency. Such an engine may at some future time be attractive when combined with an electric motor in a hybrid vehicle owing to its robust longevity and an ability to burn a wide variety of liquid fuels. Desiccant wheel A desiccant wheel is very similar to a thermal wheel, but with a coating applied for the sole purpose of dehumidifying, or \\"drying\\", the air stream. The desiccant is normally silica gel. As the wheel turns, the desiccant passes alternately through the incoming air, where the moisture is adsorbed, and through a ‚Äúregenerating‚Äù zone, where the desiccant is dried and the moisture expelled. The wheel continues to rotate, and the adsorbent process is repeated. Regeneration is normally carried out by the use of a heating coil, such as a water or steam coil, or a direct-fired gas burner. Thermal wheels and desiccant wheels are often used in series configuration to provide the required dehumidification as well as recovering the heat from the regeneration cycle. Disadvantages Thermal wheels are not suitable for use where total separation of supply and exhaust air streams is required, since air will bypass at the interface between the air streams at the heat exchanger boundary, and at the point where the wheel passes from one air stream to the other during its normal rotation. The former is reduced by brush seals, and the latter is reduced by a small purge section, formed by plating off a small segment of the wheel, normally in the exhaust air stream. Matrices made from fibrous materials, or with hygroscopic coatings, for the transfer of latent heat, are far more susceptible to damage and degradation by \\"fouling\\" than plain metal or plastic materials, and are difficult or impossible to effectively clean if dirty. Care must be taken to properly filter the air streams on both exhaust and fresh air sides of the wheel. Any dirt attaching on either air side will invariably be transported into the air stream of the other side.

Biography Balfour, when a youth fell in love with a woman far inferior in rank, much to the annoyance of the family. He was sent to travel abroad in the hope that he would forget his attachment. Before he set out he declared to his lady-love that if in his absence she married he would kill her husband. Notwithstanding the threat, she did marry a Henry Stenhouse, schoolmaster at Inverkeithing, acquainting him beforehand of the hazard. On Balfour's return his first inquiry was after the girl. On being informed of her marriage, on 9 April 1707 he proceeded on horseback with two attendants directly to the school at Inverkeithing, called Stenhouse out, deliberately shot him, wounding him in the shoulder, and quietly returned to Burleigh. The schoolmaster lingered twelve days, and then died. Balfour was tried for the murder in the High Court of Justiciary on 4 August 1709. The defence was ingenious, but inadequate; Balfour argued there had been no intent to kill, that the wound was merely to the arm and hence plainly designed to frighten or correct, and that the deceased had lived for several days after the being shot before dying of a 'fretful temper'. Balfour was found guilty, and sentenced to be beheaded on 6 January 1709-10. But a few days prior to this he escaped from the Edinburgh Tolbooth by exchanging clothes with his sister, who resembled him. He skulked for some time in the neighbourhood of Burleigh, and is reputed to have concealed himself in a hollowed ash-tree afterwards named \\"Burleigh's Hole\\". On the death of his father, in 1713, the title devolved on him. His next appearance was at the meeting of Jacobites at Lochmaben, 29 May 1714, when the Pretender's health was drunk, Lord Burleigh denouncing damnation against all who would not drink it. He engaged in the rebellion of 1715. For this he was in the same year attainted by Act of Parliament, and his estates, worth ‚Ç§697 per annum, were forfeited to the crown. Balfour's story is retold by writer Daniel Defoe in his 1724 Tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain as part of the description of the town of Inverkeithing. Defoe asserts that the tragical story had been much talked about in England at the time. Balfour died, without issue, in 1757 and was buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The attainder was reversed in 1869 in favour of Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh.

Biography Balfour was a member of the prominent Balfours of Pitcullo, Fife, the son of Colonel Henry Balfour (died 1580), and his wife, Christian Cant. He entered Dutch service in the Dutch States Army during the Thirty Years' War fighting with the Scottish brigade until 1627. In that year he became lieutenant-colonel in the Earl of Morton's regiment, took part in the expedition to the isle of Rh√© to relieve the Siege of La Rochelle, and was noticed as being one of the officers most favoured by the Duke of Buckingham.Forster, Life of Eliot, ii. 78 In January 1628, he was charged by Charles I, in conjunction with Colonel Dalbier, to raise 1,000 horse in Friesland, but the suspicions this project aroused in the House of Commons of England obliged the king to abandon the plan, and to assure the house that these troops were never meant to be employed in England. On the death of Sir Allen Apsley in 1630, Sir William, who is described as one of the gentlemen of the king's privy chamber, was appointed Lieutenant of the Tower of London.18 October 1630, Calendar of State Papers, Domestic series, of the reign of Charles I, Volume 4, p.362 In October 1631 he was employed on a confidential mission to the Netherlands. He also received many other marks of the king's favour, including the grant in 1633 of a lucrative patent for making gold and silver money in the Tower. Nevertheless Balfour, \\"from the beginning of the Long parliament, according to the natural custom of his country, forgot all his obligations to the king, and made himself very gracious to those people whose glory it was to be thought enemies of the court\\".Clarendon, History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England, iv. 147 Perhaps religious motives had something to do with this change of parties, for Balfour was a devout Presbyterian\\"Sir William Balfour, d.1660\\" at www.british-civil-wars.co.uk, accessed 4 April 2011. and a violent opponent of popery (as Roman Catholicism was called in England at the time), and had once beaten a priest for trying to convert his wife.Strafford Corr. ii. 165 Strafford was entrusted to Balfour's keeping, and though offered ¬£20,000 and an advantageous match for his daughter, he refused to connive at the earl's escape, or to admit Captain Billingsley and his suspicious levies to the Tower.2 May 1641, Historical Collections, Rushworth, iii. i. 250 The King, therefore, persuaded or obliged Balfour to resign his post in December 1641. The accounts given of the causes of this resignation differ considerably.Clarendon, iv. 101; Gardiner, History of England, x, 108; and the pamphlet entitled A Terrible Plot against London and Westminster When the parliament raised an army Sir William was appointed lieutenant-general of the horse, under the nominal command of the Earl of Bedford. He commanded the reserve at the Battle of Edgehill, broke several regiments of the king's foot, and captured part of his artillery. Ludlow describes him spiking the king's guns with his own hands, and all accounts agree in praise of his services. He did not take part in the First Battle of Newbury, having gone abroad to try the waters on account of his health.Lords' Journals, 2 August 1643 In the spring of 1644 he was detached from the army of Essex with 1,000 horse to reinforce Waller, and shared the command at the victory of New Alresford. His letter of 30 March 1644 to Essex, relating the battle, was ordered to be printed. He then rejoined Essex, accompanied him into Cornwall, and took Weymouth and Taunton (June 1644). When the infantry was forced to surrender, he broke through the king's lines, and \\"by an orderly and well-governed march passed above 100 miles in the king's quarters\\", and succeeded in joining General Middleton. At the Second Battle of Newbury he commanded the right wing of the parliamentary horse.Manchester's Quarrel with Cromwell, Camden Society; and the letters signed by Balfour, p. 55 This was Balfour's last public exploit; with the organisation of the New Model Army he retired from military service. The House of Commons appointed a committee \\"to consider of a fit recompense and acknowledgment of the faithful services done by him to the public\\" (21 January 1645), and the House of Lords voted the payment of his arrears (¬£7,000) and specially recommended him to the Commons (21 July). But some intercepted correspondence seems to have awakened suspicions and caused delays in this payment.Commons' Journals, 25 March and 12 April 1645 He was buried at Church of St Margaret, Westminster Abbey on 28 July 1660.

Description Reconstruction of Pambdelurion, a smaller relative known from much more complete remains. Reconstruction of Megadictyon, which may have been the bearer of the Omnidens mouth apparatus. Omnidens is only known from mouthparts. The preserved mouthparts would have formed a short muscular, potentially protrusible pharynx surrounded by circles of spiny sclerites, which were reminiscent of the scalids of priapulids, kinorhynchs, and loriciferans. The inside of the pharynx was also lined with several rows of pharyngeal sclerites. Based on the large size of its preserved mouthparts, Omnidens is estimated to have reached a length of up to . Its overall appearance was likely similar to that of its close relative Pambdelurion. Spines preserved near the mouthparts of Omnidens may belong to frontal appendages like those of other stem-group arthropods. Classification Omnidens is classified as a stem-group arthropod. It is so similar to Pambdelurion that the two taxa may be synonymous, but no Pambdelurion specimens are known from the same strata as Omnidens. It is possible that Omnidens mouthparts belong to the contemporary lobopodians Megadictyon or Jianshanopodia. Distribution Omnidens is a member of the Chengjiang Biota of China, which dates to approximately 520 Ma, during Cambrian Stage 3. Omnidens-like mouthparts have also been found in the slightly younger Xiaoshiba Lagerst√§tte. Pambdelurion, which has mouthparts nearly identical to those of Omnidens, is from the Sirius Passet Lagerst√§tte of Greenland.

Personnel began to be transferred to other bases and the number of personnel was decreased rapidly. All flight training at the field was discontinued on 30 April 1945 and the base was turned over to Air Technical Service Command; the base was inactivated on 1 May 1945. After inactivation, all useful military equipment was transferred from the base; the wood and tarpaper buildings were dismantled or sold. Title however, was retained by the United States Air Force and the facility was carried as a reserve airfield in the postwar years and through the 1950s. =Air Defense Command= In 1953, the United States Air Force Air Defense Command requested a third phase of twenty-five mobile radar sites be constructed to supplement the permanent national network of sites established during the Cold War. In 1957, the Air Force returned and reactivated a portion of the reserve World War II facility; opening Eagle Pass Air Force Station on a small area of the former ground station.A Handbook of Aerospace Defense Organization 1946 - 1980, by Lloyd H. Cornett and Mildred W. Johnson, Office of History, Aerospace Defense Center, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado The 733d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to Eagle Pass AFS by the 33d Air Division on 3 July 1957. The squadron began operating an AN/FPS-20A search radar and an AN/FPS-6 height-finder, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes.Information for Eagle Pass AFS, TX In addition to the main facility, Eagle Pass operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Carrizo Springs, TX (TM-188A): * Laredo, TX (TM-188B/C/TM-189B): In March 1963 the Air Force ordered the Radar site to close and operations ceased on 1 August 1963. With the closure of the ADC radar site, the majority of the station was disposed of, although the airfield was retained by the Air Force. =Air Training Command= A portion of the wartime Eagle Pass airfield was reopened under the name of Laughlin AF Aux #1 in 1962 for touch and go landings by T-37 Tweet training aircraft based at Laughlin AFB. The wartime NW/SE (14/32) runway was refurbished and asphalted, with the runway extended to the southeast to accommodate overruns on each end. The airfield was uncontrolled and no personnel were assigned to the field. In 1991 a replacement auxiliary airfield was built in nearby Spofford , and Eagle Pass Auxiliary field was closed. =Current use= With the closure of the radar station in 1963, the World War II station area was disposed of by the Air Force and transferred to Maverick County. The former ADC military family housing area was redeveloped into a government civil housing development. The local government also took over the ADC water filtration plant and a sewage disposal plant. Several light commercial and industrial sites were built on the former air base. At some point between 1991‚Äì94, after the closure of the flying field by the Air Force, the touch-and-go runway was apparently operated as a private airfield, named Bowles Airfield.Thole, Lou (1999), Forgotten Fields of America : World War II Bases and Training, Then and Now - Vol. 2. Publisher: Pictorial Histories Pub, Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Texas - Laredo area In the late 1990s, Eagle Pass Municipal Airport was closed and general aviation operations moved to Bowles Airfield, being renamed Maverick County Memorial International Airport (FAA: 5T9). Today, the airport has about 50 general aviation flight operations per month, but no commercial airline service. The airport utilizes the former Air Force NW/SE (14/32) runway, its asphalt in fair condition. The airport also has a terminal and FBO building constructed on the former World War II parking ramp. The large World War II airfield not used by the Air Force or the airport remains abandoned and left to the elements. Concrete foundations of two of the wartime hangars remain, the structures torn down in the 1960s, and the large parking ramp remains, largely in a deteriorated state. One of the World War II hangars remains, it is utilized by a private firm. The Air Defense Command radar station is largely intact. Following the radar-site closure, the FPS-20A and FPS-6 towers were torn down in late 1965. Several abandoned barracks remain standing, although one of the buildings has a collapsed second floor along with the station support buildings, the operations buildings remain standing; all concrete and steel structures, largely overgrown with vegetation and deteriorated after 50 years of abandonment. Many of the former streets of the station remain in undeveloped areas.Shaw, Frederick J.

After the 60 Minutes programme went to air, Spiteri was forcibly detained by New South Wales Police and Health Department authorities, using an obscure section of the Public Health Act (Section 32a), originally intended for the control of tuberculosis. She was kept in detention in Prince Henry Hospital's AIDS ward, and then Rozelle Mental Hospital for several weeks. Into the early 1990s Spiteri's case continued to spark national public debate.

Although there were many other sex workers in the community who were also HIV+, in similar situations and known to authorities, after her initial release Spiteri came under subsequent public health orders (as well as other agreements undisclosed by the NSW Health Department), spending much of the remaining 16 years of her life under supervision of health workers as a public patient of the NSW Health system.

Australian Adventure. University of Texas Press, 1969, p. 6. Early life He was born in San Augustine, Texas, son of John David Clark and Leila Elizabeth Downs Clark. He obtained his first degree from Tulane University, in New Orleans. In 1927, Clark married Anne Metcalfe of Greenville, Mississippi, the heir to the largest cotton plantation system in the South. Clark received a law degree in 1928 from the University of Texas. Early career He became a county attorney in San Augustine and, in 1932, moved to Austin. He was assistant attorney general of Texas. In 1935, Clark became assistant to Governor James Allred. Soon afterward, he met Lyndon B. Johnson. and the two men became close friends Allred appointed Clark secretary of state in 1937. The following year, Clark opened a private law practice with Everett Looney. He also worked as a political lobbyist for the oil industry. One of his main clients was Big Oil, a company owned by Clint Murchison Sr., and Wofford Cain. He was also a member of the Texas State Guard. Military service After the Pearl Harbor attack, Clark joined the US Army. During the Second World War, he served as a captain in the Quartermaster Corps. Clark then returned to Austin. Postwar In 1944, Clark recruited Don Thomas and his law firm became known as Clark, Thomas and Winters. Over the next few years, it became one of the most influential and successful firms in Texas. Clark also served as chairman of Texas Commerce Bank of Austin and the First National Bank of San Augustine. In 1948, Clark was appointed as Lyndon Johnson's legal counsel when Coke Stevenson contested Johnson's narrow victory in the primary. He remained active in the Democratic Party and was associated with those opposed to the liberal elements, led by Texas Senator Ralph Yarborough. After the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, Johnson became president. In 1965, Johnson appointed Clark as the US ambassador to Australia. In 1972, Clark supported Richard Nixon for president over George McGovern. In 1974, President Nixon appointed Clark to the General Advisory Committee of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Later, Clark supported Ronald Reagan, who became president. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories In 2003, Barr McClellan, an attorney who had been employed by Clark's law firm in Austin, published Blood, Money & Power: How LBJ Killed JFK. It alleged that Johnson and Clark were conspirators in the assassination of Kennedy. According to McClellan, one of the senior partners in the firm had told him that Clark had arranged the assassination. McClellan repeated his allegations in a 2003 episode of Nigel Turner's ongoing documentary television series, The Men Who Killed Kennedy titled \\"The Guilty Men\\", which was broadcast on The History Channel. Former US presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter protested, and former Johnson staffers Bill Moyers and Jack Valenti asked The History Channel to investigate the charges. On April 2, 2004, after having three historians examine the charges, The History Channel issued a press release stating that the claim of Johnson's complicity \\"is entirely unfounded and does not hold up to scrutiny.... [The show] fell short of the high standards that the network sets for itself. The History Channel apologizes to its viewers and to Mrs. Lady Bird Johnson and her family for airing the show.\\" Notes Category:1906 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Tulane University alumni Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Australia Category:People from San Augustine, Texas ","title":"Edward A.
