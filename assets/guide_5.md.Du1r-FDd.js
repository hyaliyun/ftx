Eligibility  Under the constitution of Monaco, the crown passes according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture. Only persons descended from the reigning monarch and the reigning monarch's siblings and their descendants, whose parents have been married at some point with the monarch's approval, and who are Monegasque citizens are eligible. Children born as a result of adultery are permanently excluded. A dynast forfeits succession rights if he or she marries without the monarch's permission, along with descendants of the unapproved marriage, but can be restored into the line of succession if the marriage produces no issue and ends before the demise of the crown.Monaco Should no one be eligible to succeed according to the succession laws, a council of regency takes power until the Crown Council elects a new monarch from among the more distant descendants of the House of Grimaldi.  Line of succession  The list below includes only persons eligible to succeed to the throne (numbered 1 to 16) and the illegitimate children who would enter the line if their parents ever married. *15px Prince Rainier III (1923‚Äì2005) **15px Prince Albert II (b. 1958) *** Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste (b. 2003) *** (1) Hereditary Prince Jacques (b. 2014) *** (2) Princess Gabriella, Countess of Carlad√®s (b. 2014) ** (3) Caroline, Princess of Hanover (b. 1957) *** (4) Andrea Casiraghi (b. 1984) **** (5) Alexandre (Sasha) Casiraghi (b. 2013) **** (6) Maximilian Casiraghi (b. 2018) **** (7) India Casiraghi (b. 2015) *** (8) Pierre Casiraghi (b. 1987) **** (9) Stefano Casiraghi (b. 2017) **** (10) Francesco Casiraghi (b. 2018) *** (11) Charlotte Casiraghi (b. 1986) **** Rapha√´l Elmaleh (b. 2013) **** (12) Balthazar Rassam (b. 2018) *** (13) Princess Alexandra of Hanover (b. 1999) ** (14) Princess St√©phanie (b. 1965) *** (15) Louis Ducruet (b. 1992) ***(16) Pauline Ducruet (b. 1994) *** Camille Gottlieb (b. 1998) A person born to a dynast who was not married to the other parent at the time of birth (such as Alexandre Grimaldi-Coste, Camille Gottlieb or Rapha√´l Elmaleh) does not have any succession rights unless legitimized by his or her parents' subsequent marriage (Civil Code 229 states: \\"Les enfants l√©gitim√©s par le mariage subs√©quent auront les m√™mes droits que s'ils √©taient n√©s de ce mariage\\"). Louis and Pauline Ducruet, Alexandre (Sasha) Casiraghi and Balthazar Rassam have been legitimised by their parents' subsequent marriages. Jazmin Grace Grimaldi cannot be legitimated through her parents subsequent marriage because her mother's divorce proceedings were not finalized by the time of Jazmin's birth. As such, Jazmin is legally the product of adultery and cannot be legitimated through the subsequent marriage of her biological parents. 2002 changes Until 2002, the crown of Monaco could only pass to the direct descendants, including adopted children, of the reigning prince. As a result, Princess Antoinette was not in the line of succession and Princesses Caroline and St√©phanie would have lost their places in line at the moment of Prince Albert's accession, and there would be no further dynasts eligible to succeed to the throne. This possibility had two implications, namely that a) the throne might fall vacant and Monaco might officially become a protectorate of France should Prince Albert inherit the crown and then die without fathering or adopting a legitimate heir or b) Prince Albert might adopt an unrelated person as his heir, thereby breaking the genealogical line of the House of Grimaldi. In 2002, changes were made to the Constitution of Monaco which eliminated that concern by excluding adopted children from the line of succession and providing that, if the sovereign has no legitimate child, the crown passes to one of the dynastic siblings of the sovereign or, if not living, to one of their legitimate descendants.

Life  After studying theology at the University of Berlin, his interest in astronomy and mathematics led him to study astronomy under C. A. F. Peters at the University of K√∂nigsberg. Marth went to England in 1853 to work for George Bishop, a rich wine merchant and patron of astronomy, who financed a London observatory (in operation from 1836 to 1861). At that time, paid jobs in astronomy were quite rare. He worked as William Lassell's assistant in Malta, discovering 600 nebulae. He also discovered one of the earlier asteroids found, 29 Amphitrite, and the galaxies NGC 3, NGC 4 and NGC 15. He also did work in double stars, discovering NGC 30 in 1864. From 1883 to 1897 he worked at the Markree Observatory in Ireland where he was the second director appointed in its second period of operation. He made extensive ephemerides of solar system bodies. He even performed calculations of transits of various planets from other planets, predicting transits of Earth from Mars and many others. Craters on the Moon and Mars are named for him.

Fact-checking can be conducted before (ante hoc) or after (post hoc) the text is published or otherwise disseminated. Internal fact- checking is such checking done in-house by the publisher; when the text is analyzed by a third party, the process is called external fact-checking. Ante hoc fact-checking aims to identify errors so that the text can be corrected before dissemination, or perhaps rejected. Post hoc fact-checking is most often followed by a written report of inaccuracies, sometimes with a visual metric provided by the checking organization (e.g., Pinocchios from The Washington Post Fact Checker, or TRUTH-O-METER ratings from PolitiFact). Several organizations are devoted to post hoc fact-checking: examples include FactCheck.org and PolitiFact in the US, and Full Fact in the UK. External post hoc fact-checking organizations first arose in the US in the early 2000s, and the concept grew in relevance and spread to various other countries during the 2010s. The US remains the largest market for fact-checking. Research on the impact of fact-checking is relatively recent, but the existing research suggests that fact-checking does indeed correct perceptions among citizens as well as discourage politicians from spreading false or misleading claims.  Post hoc fact-checking  External post hoc fact-checking by independent organizations began in the United States in the early 2000s. In the 2010s, particularly following the 2016 election of Donald Trump as US President, fact-checking gained a rise in popularity and spread to multiple countries mostly in Europe and Latin America. However, the US remains the largest market for fact-checking. = Consistency across fact-checkers = One study finds that fact-checkers PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and Washington Post's Fact Checker overwhelmingly agree on their evaluations of claims. However, a study by Morgan Marietta, David C. Barker and Todd Bowser found \\"substantial differences in the questions asked and the answers offered.\\" They concluded that this limited the \\"usefulness of fact-checking for citizens trying to decide which version of disputed realities to believe.\\" A paper by Chloe Lim, PhD student at Stanford University, found little overlap in the statements that fact-checkers check. Out of 1,065 fact-checks by PolitiFact and 240 fact- checks by The Washington Posts Fact-Checker, there were only 70 statements that both fact-checkers checked. The study found that the fact-checkers gave consistent ratings for 56 out of 70 statements, which means that one out every five times, the two fact-checkers disagree on the accuracy of statements. = Effects = Studies of post hoc fact-checking have made clear that such efforts often result in changes in the behavior, in general, of both the speaker (making them more careful in their pronouncements) and of the listener or reader (making them more discerning with regard to the factual accuracy of content); observations include the propensities of audiences to be completely unswayed by corrections to errors regarding the most divisive subjects, or the tendency to be more greatly persuaded by corrections of negative reporting (e.g., \\"attack ads\\"), and to see minds changed only when the individual in error was someone reasonably like-minded to begin with.Amazeen, Michelle (2015) \\"Monkey Cage: Sometimes political fact-checking works. Sometimes it doesn't. Here's what can make the difference.,\\" The Washington Post (online), 3 June 2015, see , accessed 27 July 2015.  Correcting misperceptions  A 2015 study found evidence of a \\"backfire effect\\" (correcting false information may make partisan individuals cling more strongly to their views): \\"Corrective information adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website significantly reduced belief in the myth that the flu vaccine can give patients the flu as well as concerns about its safety. However, the correction also significantly reduced intent to vaccinate among respondents with high levels of concern about vaccine side effects‚Äîa response that was not observed among those with low levels of concern.\\" A 2017 study attempted to replicate the findings of the 2015 study but failed to do so. A 2016 study found little evidence for the \\"backfire effect\\": \\"By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments.\\" A study of Donald Trump supporters during the 2016 race similarly found little evidence for the backfire effect: \\"When respondents read a news article about Mr. Trump's speech that included F.B.I. statistics indicating that crime had \\"fallen dramatically and consistently over time,\\" their misperceptions about crime declined compared with those who saw a version of the article that omitted corrective information (though misperceptions persisted among a sizable minority).\\" A 2018 study found no evidence of a backfire effect. Studies have shown that fact-checking can affect citizens' belief in the accuracy of claims made in political advertisement. A 2020 study by Paris School of Economics and Sciences Po economists found that falsehoods by Marine Le Pen during the 2017 French presidential election campaign (i) successfully persuaded voters, (ii) lost their persuasiveness when fact-checked, and (iii) did not reduce voters' political support for Le Pen when her claims were fact-checked. A 2017 study in the Journal of Politics found that \\"individuals consistently update political beliefs in the appropriate direction, even on facts that have clear implications for political party reputations, though they do so cautiously and with some bias... Interestingly, those who identify with one of the political parties are no more biased or cautious than pure independents in their learning, conditional on initial beliefs.\\" A study by Yale University cognitive scientists Gordon Pennycook and David G. Rand found that Facebook tags of fake articles \\"did significantly reduce their perceived accuracy relative to a control without tags, but only modestly\\". A Dartmouth study led by Brendan Nyhan found that Facebook tags had a greater impact than the Yale study found. A \\"disputed\\" tag on a false headline reduced the number of respondents who considered the headline accurate from 29% to 19%, whereas a \\"rated false\\" tag pushed the number down to 16%. A 2019 study found that the \\"disputed\\" tag reduced Facebook users' intentions to share a fake news story. The Yale study found evidence of a backfire effect among Trump supporters younger than 26 years whereby the presence of both untagged and tagged fake articles made the untagged fake articles appear more accurate. In response to research which questioned the effectiveness of the Facebook \\"disputed\\" tags, Facebook decided to drop the tags in December 2017 and would instead put articles which fact-checked a fake news story next to the fake news story link whenever it is shared on Facebook. Based on the findings of a 2017 study in the journal Psychological Science, the most effective ways to reduce misinformation through corrections is by: * limiting detailed descriptions of / or arguments in favor of the misinformation; * walking through the reasons why a piece of misinformation is false rather than just labelling it false; * presenting new and credible information which allows readers to update their knowledge of events and understand why they developed an inaccurate understanding in the first place; * using video, as videos appear to be more effective than text at increasing attention and reducing confusion, making videos more effective at correcting misperception than text. A 2019 meta- analysis of research into the effects of fact-checking on misinformation found that fact-checking has substantial positive impacts on political beliefs, but that this impact weakened when fact-checkers used \\"truth scales\\", refuted only parts of a claim and when they fact-checked campaign-related statements. Individuals' preexisting beliefs, ideology, and knowledge affected to what extent the fact-checking had an impact. A 2019 study in the Journal of Experimental Political Science found \\"strong evidence that citizens are willing to accept corrections to fake news, regardless of their ideology and the content of the fake stories.\\" A paper by Andrew Guess (of Princeton University), Brendan Nyhan (Dartmouth College) and Jason Reifler (University of Exeter) found that consumers of fake news tended to have less favorable views of fact-checking, in particular Trump supporters. The paper found that fake news consumers rarely encountered fact-checks: \\"only about half of the Americans who visited a fake news website during the study period also saw any fact-check from one of the dedicated fact-checking website (14.0%).\\" A 2018 study found that Republicans were more likely to correct their false information on voter fraud if the correction came from Breitbart News rather than a non-partisan neutral source such as PolitiFact. A 2020 study found that exposure to fact-checks had durable effects on reducing misperceptions.  Political discourse  A 2015 experimental study found that fact-checking can encourage politicians to not spread misinformation. The study found that it might help improve political discourse by increasing the reputational costs or risks of spreading misinformation for political elites. The researchers sent, \\"a series of letters about the risks to their reputation and electoral security if they were caught making questionable statements. The legislators who were sent these letters were substantially less likely to receive a negative fact-checking rating or to have their accuracy questioned publicly, suggesting that fact-checking can reduce inaccuracy when it poses a salient threat.\\"  Political preferences  One experimental study found that fact-checking during debates affected viewers' assessment of the candidates' debate performance and \\"greater willingness to vote for a candidate when the fact-check indicates that the candidate is being honest.\\" A study of Trump supporters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that while fact-checks of false claims made by Trump reduced his supporters' belief in the false claims in question, the corrections did not alter their attitudes towards Trump. A 2019 study found that \\"summary fact-checking\\", where the fact-checker summarizes how many false statements a politician has made, has a greater impact on reducing support for a politician than fact-checking of individual statements made by the politician. =Criticism and controversies= Political fact-checking is sometimes criticized as being opinion journalism. Criticism has included that fact-checking organizations in themselves are biased or that it is impossible to apply absolute terms such as \\"true\\" or \\"false\\" to inherently debatable claims. In September 2016, a Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey found that \\"just 29% of all Likely U.S. Voters trust media fact-checking of candidates' comments. Sixty-two percent (62%) believe instead that news organizations skew the facts to help candidates they support.\\" = Informal fact-checking = Individual readers perform some types of fact-checking, such as comparing claims in one news story against claims in another. Rabbi Moshe Benovitz, has observed that: \\"modern students use their wireless worlds to augment skepticism and to reject dogma.\\" He says this has positive implications for values development: = Detecting fake news = Fake news has become increasingly prevalent over the last few years, with the 2016 election revealing that online media platforms were especially susceptible to disseminating disinformation and misinformation . Fake news articles tend to come from satirical news websites or individual websites with an incentive to propagate false information, either as clickbait or to serve a purpose. Since these articles typically hope to intentionally promote biased or incorrect information, these articles are difficult to detect. When identifying a source of information, one must look at many attributes, including but not limited to the content of the email and social media engagements. The language, specifically, is typically more inflammatory in fake news than real articles, in part because the purpose is to confuse and generate clicks. Furthermore, modeling techniques such as n-gram encodings and bag of words have served as other linguistic techniques to determine the legitimacy of a news course. On top of that, researchers have determined that visual-based cues also play a factor in categorizing an article, specifically some features can be designed to assess if a picture was legitimate, and provides us more clarity on the news. There is also many social context features that can play a role, as well as the model of spreading the news. Websites such as ‚ÄúSnopes‚Äù try to detect this information manually, while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to do this themselves. Some individuals and organizations publish their fact-checking efforts on the internet. These may have a special subject-matter focus, such as Snopes.com's focus on urban legends or the Reporters' Lab at Duke University's focus on providing resources to journalists. = Fake News and Social Media = The adaptation of social media as a legitimate and commonly used platform has created extensive concerns for fake news in this domain. The spread of fake news via social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram presents the opportunity for extremely negative effects on society therefore new fields of research regarding fake news detection on social media is gaining momentum. However, fake news detection on social media presents challenges that renders previous data mining and detection techniques inadequate. As such, researchers are calling for more work to be done regarding fake news as characterized against psychology and social theories and adapting existing data mining algorithms to apply to social media networks. Further, multiple scientific articles have been published urging the field further to find automatic ways in which fake news can be filtered out of social media timelines.  Ongoing research in fact-checking and detecting fake news  Donald Trump, a prominent figure in regards to fake news Since the 2016 United States presidential election, fake news has been a popular topic of discussion by President Trump and news outlets. The reality of fake news had become omnipresent, and a lot of research has gone into understanding, identifying, and combating fake news. Also, a number of researchers began with the usage of fake news to influence the 2016 presidential campaign. One research found evidence of pro-Trump fake news being selectively targeted on conservatives and pro-Trump supporters in 2016. The researchers found that social media sites, Facebook in particular, to be powerful platforms to spread certain fake news to targeted groups to appeal to their sentiments during the 2016 presidential race. Additionally, researchers from Stanford, NYU, and NBER found evidence to show how engagement with fake news on Facebook and Twitter was high throughout 2016. Recently, a lot of work has gone into detecting and identifying fake news through machine learning and artificial intelligence. In 2018, researchers at MIT's CSAIL (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab) created and tested a machine learning algorithm to identify false information by looking for common patterns, words, and symbols that typically appear in fake news. More so, they released an open-source data set with a large catalog of historical news sources with their veracity scores to encourage other researchers to explore and develop new methods and technologies for detecting fake news. International Fact-Checking Day The concept for International Fact- Checking Day was introduced at a conference for journalists and fact-checkers at the London School of Economics in June 2014. The holiday was officially created in 2016 and first celebrated on April 2, 2017. The idea for International Fact-Checking day rose out of the many misinformation campaigns found on the internet, particularly social media sites. It rose in importance after the 2016 elections, which brought fake news, as well as accusations of it, to the forefront of media issues. The holiday is held on April 2 because \\"April 1 is a day for fools. April 2 is a day for facts.\\" Activities for International Fact-Checking Day consist of various media organizations contributing to fact-checking resources, articles, and lessons for students and the general public to learn more about how to identify fake news and stop the spread of misinformation. 2020's International Fact-Checking Day focused specifically on how to accurately identify information about COVID-19.  Ante hoc fact-checking  Among the benefits of printing only checked copy is that it averts serious, sometimes costly, problems. These problems can include lawsuits for mistakes that damage people or businesses, but even small mistakes can cause a loss of reputation for the publication. The loss of reputation is often the more significant motivating factor for journalists. Fact checkers verify that the names, dates, and facts in an article or book are correct. For example, they may contact a person who is quoted in a proposed news article and ask the person whether this quotation is correct, or how to spell the person's name. Fact-checkers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes; they are not guaranteed safeguards against those who wish to commit journalistic frauds. = As a career = Professional fact checkers have generally been hired by newspapers, magazines, and book publishers, probably starting in the early 1920s with the creation of Time magazine in the United States, though they were not originally called \\"fact-checkers\\". Fact checkers may be aspiring writers, future editors, or freelancers engaged other projects; others are career professionals. Historically, the field was considered women's work, and from the time of the first professional American fact checker through at least the 1970s, the fact checkers at a media company might be entirely female or primarily so. The number of people employed in fact-checking varies by publication. Some organizations have substantial fact- checking departments. For example, The New Yorker magazine had 16 fact checkers in 2003. Others may hire freelancers per piece, or may combine fact- checking with other duties. Magazines are more likely to use fact checkers than newspapers. Television and radio programs rarely employ dedicated fact checkers, and instead expect others, including senior staff, to engage in fact-checking in addition to their other duties. =Checking original reportage= Stephen Glass began his journalism career as a fact-checker. He went on to invent fictitious stories, which he submitted as reportage, and which fact-checkers at The New Republic (and other weeklies for which he worked) never flagged. Michael Kelly, who edited some of Glass's concocted stories, blamed himself, rather than the fact-checkers, saying: \\"Any fact- checking system is built on trust ... If a reporter is willing to fake notes, it defeats the system. Anyway, the real vetting system is not fact-checking but the editor.\\" = Education on fact-checking = With the circulation of fake news on the internet, many organizations have dedicated time to create guidelines to help read to verify the information they are consuming. Many universities across America provide university students resources and tools to help them verify their sources. Universities provide access to research guides that help students conduct thorough research with reputable sources within academia. Organizations like FactCheck.org, OntheMedia.org, and PolitiFact.com provide procedural guidelines that help individuals navigate the process to fact-check a source.

It was invented in 1865 and patented and put into production in 1870, and was the first commercially produced typewriter.  Design  The writing ball (Danish: skrivekugle) was invented in 1865 by the reverend Rasmus Malling-Hansen (1835‚Äì1890) principal of the Royal Institute for the Deaf-Mutes in Copenhagen. The Hansen ball was a combination of unusual design and ergonomic innovations: its distinctive feature was an arrangement of 52 keys on a large brass hemisphere, causing the machine to resemble an oversized pincushion. From the book Hvem er Skrivekuglens Opfinder, written by Malling-Hansen's daughter Johanne Agerskov, we know how Malling-Hansen made experiments with a model of his writing ball made out of porcelain. He tried out different placements of the letters on the keys, to work out the placement that led to the quickest writing speed. He ended up placing the most frequently used letters to be touched by the fastest writing fingers, and also placed most of the vowels to the left and the consonants to the right. This, together with the short pistons which went directly through the ball, made the writing speed of the writing ball very fast. Like most of the early 19th-century typewriters, it did not allow the paper to be seen as it passed through the device. = Early designs = The first models typed on a paper attached to a cylinder, which could be made to move both rotationally with the cylinder and longitudinally along the cylinder, enabling the user to format and space the letters manually. The user would attach a piece of white paper and a sheet of coloring paper onto the cylinder by way of several clips. These models also included an electro-magnet for the Ball which controlled both the typewriter's movement and manipulation, thus making Malling-Hansen's machine the first electric typewriter. This electro-magnet was powered by a 10 or 12-cell battery, and controlled a mechanical escapement in the typewriter's clockwork, moving the carriage a fixed amount each time one of the pistons was depressed. = Improvements = Malling-Hansen made several improvements on his invention throughout the 1870s and 1880s, and in 1874 he patented the next model, and now the cylinder was replaced by a flat mechanical paper-frame. The electromagnetic battery was still used to move the paper along as the Ball typed upon it, and the design led to a lower possibility for error. Malling- Hansen improved further on his design, and created a semi-cylindrical frame to hold one sheet of paper. This best known model was first patented in 1875, and now the battery was replaced by a mechanical escapement. All these improvements made for a simpler and more compact writing apparatus.  Sale and popular use  It was exhibited at a great industrial exhibition in Copenhagen in 1873, at the world exhibition in Vienna in 1873, and at the Paris exhibition or Exposition Universelle. All through the 1870s it won several awards. The writing ball was sold in many countries in Europe, and it is known that it was still in use in offices in London as late as 1909. But due to its hand-crafted production, it was overtaken in the market by the mass-produced Sholes and Glidden typewriter which E. Remington and Sons started to make in 1873. Malling-Hansen also invented a very high speed writing machine for stenography, called the Takygraf, and a copying technique called the Xerografi‚Äîboth invented in 1872. More-or-less intact Hansen balls have fetched hundreds of thousands of Euros in auctions. Few remain in existence today. In 1881, when he had serious problems with his sight, Friedrich Nietzsche wanted to buy a typewriter to enable him to continue his writing, and from letters to his sister it is known that he personally was in contact with \\"the inventor of the typewriter, Mr Malling-Hansen from Copenhagen\\". He mentioned to his sister that he had received letters and also a typewritten postcard as an example. Nietzsche received his writing ball in 1882 directly from the inventor, Rasmus Malling-Hansen, in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was the newest model, the portable tall one with a color ribbon, serial number 125, and several typescripts are known to have been written by him on this writing ball (approximately 60). It is known that Nietzsche was also familiar with the newest model from E. Remington and Sons (model 2), but he wanted to buy a portable typewriter, so he chose to buy the Malling-Hansen writing ball, as this model was lightweight and easy to carry. Unfortunately, Nietzsche wasn't totally satisfied with his purchase and never really mastered the use of the instrument. A number of theories have been advanced to explain why Nietzsche did not make more use of it. For example, R√ºdiger Safranski indicates it was \\"defective\\".R√ºdiger Safranski, Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography, W. W. Norton & Company, 2002, p250 New research indicates Nietzsche was not aware that his trouble in using the machine had been caused by damage to it during transportation to Genoa in Italy, where he lived at the time,Dieter Eberwein, Nietzsches Schreibkugel, Eberwein Typoskript, 2005 and when he turned to a mechanic who had no typewriter repair skills, the man managed to damage the writing ball even more. Nietzsche claimed that his thoughts were influenced by his use of a typewriter (\\"Our writing instruments contribute to our thoughts\\", 1882).Don Ihde, Bodies in Technology, University of Minnesota Press, 2001, p97 As one researcher has noted, \\"Nietzsche's interest in rhetoric and his experience of the typewriter framed his understanding of language in a highly symbolic way: the traditions of the philosophy of language versus the scientific and technological conditions of knowledge.\\"Christian Emden, Nietzsche on Language, Consciousness, and the Body, University of Illinois Press, 2005, p28 On February 16, 1882 he even made a poem about his writing ball.

The church was named in honor of the missionary Saint Francis Xavier. It was raised to the status of a Minor Basilica in 1956. The church and rectory were listed together on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. History The Main Altar (foreground) and former High Altar (background) Dyersville was originally settled by English immigrants. Within a few years the English moved on, and many German immigrants began to arrive in the area. A parish was founded to serve these immigrants in 1859. The first St. Francis Xavier Church was completed in 1862. The parish grew quickly and the church had to be doubled in size by 1869. By 1880, it became clear that with the increasing Catholic population of Dyersville and the surrounding area, the old church building would no longer be adequate. A new church building program was begun in the mid-1880s. The parish decided on a large Gothic Revival style building in order to serve the increased population. Dubuque architects Fridolin Heer, Sr. and his son Fridolin Heer, Jr. designed the church. The priest at the time, Anton Kortenkamp (1834-1889), also had the foresight to have the altar placed upon a foundation of solid rock, which is one of the requirements for an altar to be consecrated. Construction was begun in 1887, and the cornerstone was laid on June 3, 1888. The new church was dedicated by Bishop John Hennessy on December 3, 1889. When the building was dedicated, special trains brought people from all over the state of Iowa to witness the ceremony. It cost approximately $100,000 dollars to build the church. After the completion of the present building, the old church was converted into classrooms. It was later torn down after a new school was completed. Electric lights were added to the church in 1904. The interior of the church is decorated with a number of paintings and frescoes. Much of this work was done by Milwaukee artists Clotilda and Alphonse Brielmaier from 1904 to 1905. Work to either touch-up the original frescoes or to partially cover some of them was done in 1930 and 1955. The rectory was built to the west of the church in 1935. The brick residence contains 14 rooms. The rooms are a combination of private living space and offices. A. J. Osterhaus Construction of Dyersville was the contractor who built the rectory. A garage and a passageway connects it to the Basilica. Wall fresco details The move to elevate St. Francis Xavier to a minor basilica began in the 1940s. Then-Father Mathias M. Hoffman, who had served as a military chaplain in Europe in World War I and World War II, began to advance the cause to Vatican officials. The cause was furthered when a high ranking German Cardinal, Konrad von Preysing, visited the church. In the mid-1950s the church building was consecrated. On the interior there are a number of small gold crosses on the side walls, marking the twelve places where the church walls were anointed with chrism when the church was consecrated. Once consecrated a church building may never be used for any other purpose and only a consecrated church can be elevated to the rank of a Basilica. Previously the parish had worked hard to attain and maintain a debt- free status, a preliminary requirement before a church can be consecrated. On May 11, 1956 the church was elevated to the rank of a Minor Basilica by Pope Pius XII. It was the twelfth church in the United States to receive this honor. A mass officially naming the church as a Basilica attracted crowds from all over the state, as well as many high ranking clergy. An addition was made to the south side of the Basilica in 1989. It contains a handicapped elevator, restrooms and access to the basement of the Basilica. In the mid-1990s, the parish began to offer a Tridentine Mass at 12:00 p.m. on Sundays. This mass is either said or sung in Latin according to the 1962 Rite. At other times the Noon Mass is offered in Spanish. The interior of the church was refurbished from 2000 to 2001. The paintings and frescoes were cleaned. Other frescoes that were hidden under coats of paint were restored. The Baldacchino, the main altars, the side altars, and the statues were cleaned and restored. This was possible due to a gift from a parishioner. The church building The Rose Window The basilica features Ruskinian Gothic Revival architecture. The two steeples are tall with crosses that cap the spires. This helps make the church visible from miles away across the rolling lightly forested farmland. Pilots often use these steeples as landmarks during flights. The church is a rectangular structure that measures and is high. It has a polygonal apse on its west side. The interior includes columns and vaulted ceilings. The church has a seating capacity of about 1,000 people. There are about 5,000 people total in the parish. The church has 64 large cathedral glass windows. There are two notable windows in the church. The first is the rose window above the entrances to the church, installed in 1959. It replaced a conventional church window on which the framework had become deteriorated. An Indian motif was selected in recognition of many local Indian tribes that inhabited this area 150 years earlier. The nave looking to ward the altar. The two side altars were designed by J. E. Brielmaier and erected by the Dubuque Altar Company in March 1897. They measure and are made of butternut. Mary's altar is called \\"The Coronation\\" and Joseph's is called \\"The Holy Family\\". Brielmaier also designed the butternut Baldacchino over the high altar, which is carved Italian marble by the Milwaukee Monument Company, and they were both installed in December 1897. The Baldacchino rises to a height of . The wood carved crucifix above the altar was created in 1873 for the original church. The ornate pulpit from 1906 sits to the left of the altar. Also carved in butternut, it was originally located in the nave and had a carved canopy over it. It was moved into chancel in the 1940s and the canopy was removed at that time. The images carved on the pulpit include the Evangelists: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John as well as the Apostles Peter and Paul; and five Doctors of the Western Church: Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. A free-standing altar was commissioned from the John C. Kaiser Company of Dubuque and created by Fritz Ganshirt. It was installed in 1973. St. Francis Xavier ministering to the Indians Above the high altar is a large central painting of the heavenly liturgy mentioned in Revelations 5: the Adoration of the Mystical Lamb of God. To the right are images of the prophets that include John the Baptist, Noah holding the ark, David playing the harp, Melichisedech holding bread and wine, Moses holding the Ten Commandments, and the Three Magi with their gifts. The image of Msgr. M.M. Hoffmann, the pastor when the church was named a Basilica, was added in 2000. To the left are images of saints that include the Blessed Virgin Mary, George with a spear, Lawrence with a gridiron, Stephen with stones, Joseph with a lily, Rose of Lima with a crown of roses, Peter with keys, Paul with sword, Henry the King, Boniface, Francis of Assisi, Francis Xavier, Catherine, and Cecilia playing the organ. An image of the Rev. George W. Heer, who was pastor of the parish when the original painting was done, was added during its restoration. The Stations of the Cross that line side walls were installed in 1959. The plaster bas reliefs replaced the original set that dated from 1870, which had deteriorated. The images on the center aisle were installed in 1998. It is the first floor of its kind in the United States to combine \\"epoxy based terrazzo, and computer generated water jet laser cutting for the brass molds.\\" The symbols in the floor include the coats of arms of the Archdiocese of Dubuque, Pope Pius XII, the Basilica, and the Papal insignia of the Tiara and Keys. In 1971 a new organ was installed in the church that replaced the Basilica's original pipe organ, which dated from 1913. The 27-rank organ located in the rear gallery is a custom made instrument designed for the Basilica by the Wicks Organ Company of Highland, Illinois. The organ was designed keeping in mind the size of the church and the acoustical qualities of the building. In 2019 the organ was rebuilt and expanded by the Reuter Organ Company, giving the organ a new facade of speaking pipes and adding the choir division that had been left out of the 1971 organ. Additionally due to damage from a lightning strike shortly after the 1971 organ was installed, the organ was experiencing issues with its electrical system. This electrical system was replaced with a fiber optic system which is much more resistant to electrical issues than the older organ. Because one of the roles of the basilica is to serve as the Pope's church in the event he would visit the area, the church features a special bell called a Tintinnabulum, and an umbrella called an Umbraculum. Visitation of the Pope has been heavily rumored in Vatican circles as part of the next North American trip, scheduled for 2019, and funds are expected to be appropriated so that the umbrella can be opened all the way.

Blades Hall and the Dunlap Technology building are also visible. Charles C. Myers Library Meyers Teaching and Administrative Center under construction The University of Dubuque (UD) is a private Presbyterian university in Dubuque, Iowa. About 2,200 students attend the university. History The University of Dubuque has had a long history in Dubuque since its founding in 1852. It has gone through many changes over the years and has recently experienced a controversial, but prosperous rebirth. =Early years= The institution currently known as the University of Dubuque was founded by the Rev. Adrian Van Vliet, who was pastor of the German Presbyterian Church, now known as the First Presbyterian Church of Dubuque, in 1852 to train ministers to serve the influx of immigrants to the upper midwest. Van Vliet believed the large number of immigrants -- particularly German farmers and miners -- would need ministers of the gospel for the communities they were establishing. He began by training two young men, conducting classes in his home. Although Van Vliet was Dutch, until 1896 all classes were conducted in German. Initially the school was Van Vliet's independent endeavor. In 1864 the Presbytery of Dubuque assumed control of the institution, and it became known as The German Theological School of The North West. In 1870 the Presbyterian Church of the United States took control of the school. In 1871, following the death of Van Vliet, Jacob Conzett was selected to lead the school. In 1872 the school moved to a brick building on the north side of 17th street, where it would remain for the next 35 years. In 1901 Cornelius Martin Steffens came on board as financial secretary. He proved to be an outstanding fund raiser. He also helped the school expand its curriculum. A liberal arts college and academy were added to the school, and the first college degrees were granted in 1906. It was Steffens's idea to move the school to larger quarters. Property on the western edge of the city was acquired in 1905 for that purpose. Steffens served as school president from 1908 to 1924. The school moved to its present location on University Avenue in 1907. The first buildings constructed at this new location were the Administration Building (1907, later renamed Steffens Hall), Severance Hall (1911), the University Bookstore (1912), McCormick Gymnasium (1915), Peters Commons (1916), and Van Vliet Hall (1926). All except Steffens Hall are still standing. Steffens Hall was demolished in 1980 and replaced with Blades Hall, but some of its archways were preserved and can be seen today. In 1911 the college became coeducational. In 1916 the school, then known as the Dubuque German College and Seminary, dropped the word \\"German\\" from its name, due in part to anti-German sentiment inflamed by the First World War, and became known as Dubuque College. However, present-day Loras College, located just down the street, also called itself Dubuque College. In the end, neither school kept that name. The Roman Catholic school took the name of Mathias Loras, first archbishop of Dubuque, while the Presbyterian school became the University of Dubuque on June 17, 1920. =Expansion= The new portion of the Goldthorp Science Hall, under construction in March 2006. A portion of the original building can be seen at the right rear of the image. In the 1950s and 60s, during the administration of Dr. Gaylord Couchman, a number of building projects took place: the Seminary Library (1955), Smith Hall, a seminary residence (1956), Goldthorp Science Hall (1959), Aitchison Hall, a women's residence (1963), Ficke-Laird Library (1966), Cassat Hall, a men's residence (1966), and Donnell Hall, another men's residence (1967). McCormick Gymnasium was expanded in 1967. Another large addition to it, named the Stoltz Sports Center, was made later. The original building was also renovated to include a new indoor swimming pool, racquetball courts, a hall of fame, and a multi- purpose area. =Controversy, change, and new leadership= In 1999, the university informed 14 professors, 10 of whom held tenured positions, that they would lose their positions due to a financial crisis. A report by The American Association of University Professors raised concerns about this action, and the AAUP placed the university on its list of censured administrations (where it still remains). The university was granted a provisional six-year accreditation by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools due to concerns about academics in the wake of the financial crisis. In 2005, however, the university was granted a full accreditation after a lengthy review process. In 2003 the university received an endowment to implement the Lester G. Wendt and Michael Lester Wendt Character Initiative, currently overseen by the Wendt Center for Character Education, which among other tasks encourages ethical character development of university students and integration of the same into the university curriculum. Also associated with the Wendt name was a Wendt University Professorship, granted in 2005 to Dr. Paul Jeffries, a professor of philosophy. (Note that this is not Paul C. Jeffries, also a Ph.D. in philosophy, who used to be in academia but now works in technology.) As the Wendt professor, Dr. Jeffries was to oversee the initiative and \\"speak broadly\\" about it in the university and external community. During the same year, Dr. Jeffries came up for a new tenure contract. The university offered him a contract, but he objected to a provision restricting negative speech about the university, which he felt could interfere with his objectivity in speaking about ethics and character. The offer of tenure was immediately revoked and Dr. Jeffries was dismissed from the university, an action that stirred considerable unrest among students and faculty. =Continued development= The university has completed building additional student housing on land adjacent to Dodge Street, the main east-west thoroughfare through the city. This property remained vacant for many years until the new apartments were built. Park Village apartments are typically only available to upperclassmen. The university currently has approximately 2000 students in attendance. Academics The University of Dubuque consists of a Theological Seminary and three schools: *School of Business *School of Liberal Arts *School of Professional Programs The university is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, the Council on Aviation Accreditation, and the Association of Theological Schools in North America. It is also approved by the State of Iowa Department of Education. Athletics The school has been involved in intercollegiate sports for many decades. The teams are called the Spartans, and the school colors are blue and white. There was a brief period, from 1925 to 1928, when the university withdrew from intercollegiate sports and focused on intramural competition. This was done because University president Karl Wettstone was opposed to the commercialization of sports and the recruiting of athletes with offers of free tuition, room, and board. There also were concerns about the salaries some coaches had received, which were felt to be excessive compared to the compensation paid other department heads. Following the reinstatement of intercollegiate competition, the University of Dubuque joined the Iowa Conference, now known as the American Rivers Conference, in 1929. The University of Dubuque is a member of NCAA Division III, and is part of the American Rivers Conference, which, in addition to the University of Dubuque, currently includes Buena Vista University, Coe College, Central College, Luther College, Loras College, Nebraska Wesleyan University, Simpson College, and Wartburg College. Men's varsity sports include football, baseball, basketball, cross-country, golf, soccer, lacrosse, indoor and outdoor track, tennis, and wrestling. Women's varsity sports include basketball, soccer, golf, cross country, softball, volleyball, lacrosse, track, and tennis. In 2008, the school officially recognized its first club sports team, ice hockey. Students now have the opportunity to participate in an increasingly popular winter sport against other conference rivals including Loras and Cornell college while attending the University of Dubuque. A recent addition to club sport includes a campus Bass Fishing team which is one of the top-ranked in the country.matt klaes Notable alumni Notable graduates of the University of Dubuque include Walter Soboleff, a Tlingit scholar, elder and religious leader. He was the first Native Alaskan to become an ordained Presbyterian minister. Solomon \\"Sol\\" Butler, a track star who set national and world records, competed in the 1920s Olympics and was one of the first black players in the National Football League as well as an early actor in Hollywood films. 1926 graduate of the University, Nemesio Rodriguez, an exchange student from Lima, Peru, later went on to become the prime minister of education for the country of Peru (he also married classmate of '26, Florence Parker), actor Tony Danza, a star of the TV sitcoms Taxi and Who's the Boss?; and novelist Eckhard Gerdes, author of thirteen published novels, including My Landlady the Lobotomist and Hugh Moore. George O'Leary, former football coach at the University of Central Florida played football at the university in the 1960s but did not graduate. O'Leary gained notoriety when he was hired then dropped as Notre Dame head coach when it was discovered that he fabricated his resume. Field of Dreams movie location Along with other places in Dubuque County, the university was used as a shooting location for the motion picture Field of Dreams. The Seminary Library, Blades Hall, and Van Vliet Hall were used in a scene where Kevin Costner's character is researching Terrance Mann. The movie made it appear the library was located in Van Vliet Hall, which is incorrect. Van Vliet is currently an office building, although a new administration building was recently completed. Also, the spot where Annie parked the family pickup truck was and still is in a \\"no parking\\" zone.

Most are small, sturdy and evergreen. The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks. Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture. At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them. Taxonomy The genus name is derived from the Greek words œáŒµ·øñŒªŒøœÇ (cheilos), meaning \\"lip,\\" and ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (anthos), meaning \\"flower.\\" Cheilanthes as traditionally circumscribed is now known to be highly paraphyletic, comprising at least four generically separate groups. The type species, C. micropteris, is most closely allied to the genera Aleuritopteris and Sinopteris (Schuettpelz et al.). In the early 21st century, many species, principally from the New World, were moved into the new genus Gaga and the revived genus Myriopteris. Further work remains to be done to render Cheilanthes monophyletic. Members of many other cheilanthoid genera have at times been given names in the genus. Species The circumscription of the genus was uncertain . The Checklist of Ferns and Lycophytes of the World lists species in several distinct groups. Cheilanthes sensu stricto contains about 20 species from North and tropical Central and South America: *Cheilanthes arequipensis (Maxon) R.M.Tryon & A.F.Tryon *Cheilanthes fractifera Tryon *Cheilanthes glutinosa M.Kessler & A.R.Sm. *Cheilanthes incarum Maxon *Cheilanthes incisa Kunze ex Mett. *Cheilanthes juergensii Rosenst. *Cheilanthes laciniata Sodiro *Cheilanthes leonardii Maxon *Cheilanthes leucopoda Link *Cheilanthes lonchophylla (R.M.Tryon) R.M.Tryon & A.F.Tryon *Cheilanthes macleanii (J.Sm.)

Alton Jones Professor, Vanderbilt University (1982), *Professor of Philosophy, University of Notre Dame (1985), *Professor of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University (1985), *Visiting scholar, Whitney Humanities Center, Yale University (1988), *McMahon-Hank Professor of Philosophy, Notre Dame (1989), and *Arts & Sciences Professor of Philosophy, Duke University (1995‚Äì1997). He has also been a visiting professor at Princeton University, and is a former president of the American Philosophical Association. In 2010, he was awarded the Aquinas Medal by the American Catholic Philosophical Association. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1985), the British Academy (1994), the Royal Irish Academy (1999), and the American Philosophical Society (2005). From 2000 he was the Rev. John A. O'Brien Senior Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy (emeritus since 2010) at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, US. He is also professor emerit and emeritus at Duke University. in July 2010 became senior research fellow at London Metropolitan University's Centre for Contemporary Aristotelian Studies in Ethics and Politics. Since his retirement from active teaching in 2010, he remains the senior distinguished research fellow of the Notre Dame Center for Ethics and Culture, where he retains an office. He continues to make public presentations, including an annual keynote as part of the Center for Ethics and Culture's Fall Conference.. He has been married three times. From 1953 to 1963 he was married to Ann Peri, with whom he had two daughters. From 1963 to 1977 he was married to former teacher and now poet Susan Willans, with whom he had a son and daughter. Since 1977 he has been married to philosopher Lynn Joy, who is also on the philosophy faculty at Notre Dame. Philosophical approach MacIntyre's approach to moral philosophy interweaves a number of complex strands. Although he largely aims to revive an Aristotelian moral philosophy based on the virtues, he claims a \\"peculiarly modern understanding\\" of this task.After Virtue, (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 3rd edn, 2007) xii. This \\"peculiarly modern understanding\\" largely concerns MacIntyre's approach to moral disputes. Unlike some analytic philosophers who try to generate moral consensus on the basis of rationality, MacIntyre uses the historical development of ethics to circumvent the modern problem of \\"incommensurable\\" moral notions, whose merits cannot be compared in any common framework. Following Hegel and Collingwood, he offers a \\"philosophical history\\" (as opposed to analytical and phenomenological approaches) in which he concedes from the beginning that \\"there are no neutral standards available by appeal to which any rational agent whatsoever could determine\\" the conclusions of moral philosophy.After Virtue, 3, xiii. In his most famous work, After Virtue, he deprecates the attempt of Enlightenment thinkers to deduce a universal rational morality independent of teleology, whose failure led to the rejection of moral rationality altogether by successors such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Charles Stevenson. He emphasizes how this overestimation of reason led to Nietzsche's utter repudiation of the possibility of moral rationality.After Virtue, 257 By contrast, MacIntyre attempts to reclaim more modest forms of moral rationality and argumentation which claim neither finality nor logical certainty, but which can hold up against relativistic or emotivist denials of any moral rationality whatsoever (the mistaken conclusion of Nietzsche, Sartre, and Stevenson). He revives the tradition of Aristotelian ethics with its teleological account of the good and of moral actions, as fulfilled in the medieval writings of Thomas Aquinas. This Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition, he proposes, presents \\"the best theory so far,\\" both of how things are and how we ought to act. More generally, according to MacIntyre, moral disputes always take place within and between rival traditions of thought relying on an inherited store of ideas, presuppositions, types of arguments and shared understandings and approaches. Even though there is no definitive way for one tradition in moral philosophy to logically refute another, nevertheless opposing views can dispute each others' internal coherence, resolution of imaginative dilemmas and epistemic crises, and achievement of fruitful results.After Virtue, xii‚Äìxiii Major writings =After Virtue (1981)= Probably his most widely read work, After Virtue was written when MacIntyre was already in his fifties. Up to then, MacIntyre had been a relatively influential analytic philosopher of Marxist bent whose moral inquiries had been conducted in a \\"piecemeal way, focusing first on this problem and then on that, in a mode characteristic of much analytic philosophy.\\"The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006) viii However, after reading the works of Thomas Kuhn and Imre Lakatos on philosophy of science and epistemology, MacIntyre was inspired to change the entire direction of his thought, tearing up the manuscript he had been working on and deciding to view the problems of modern moral and political philosophy \\"not from the standpoint of liberal modernity, but instead from the standpoint of‚Ä¶ Aristotelian moral and political practice.\\"The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1, viii. In general terms, the task of After Virtue is to account both for the dysfunction of modern moral discourse in modern society and to rehabilitate the alternative of teleological rationality in Aristotelian virtue ethics. MacIntyre's philippic articulates a politics of self-defence for local communities who aspire to protect their traditional way of life from the corrosive capitalist free market. =Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (1988)= MacIntyre's second major work of his mature period takes up the problem of giving an account of philosophical rationality within the context of his notion of \\"traditions,\\" which had still remained under-theorized in After Virtue. Specifically, MacIntyre argues that rival and largely incompatible conceptions of justice are the outcome of rival and largely incompatible forms of practical rationality. These competing forms of practical rationality and their attendant ideas of justice are in turn the result of \\"socially embodied traditions of rational inquiry.\\"\\"Pr√©cis of Whose Justice? Which Rationality?\\" in MacIntyre Reader, ed. Kelvin Knight (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1998) 107. Although MacIntyre's treatment of traditions is quite complex he does give a relatively concise definition: \\"A tradition is an argument extended through time in which certain fundamental agreements are defined and redefined\\" in terms of both internal and external debates.Whose Justice? Which Rationality? (Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1988) 12. Much of Whose Justice? Which Rationality? is therefore engaged in the task of not only giving the reader examples of what MacIntyre considers actual rival traditions and the different ways they can split apart, integrate, or defeat one another (e.g. Aristotelian, Augustinian, Thomist, Humean) but also with substantiating how practical rationality and a conception of justice help constitute those traditions. Specifically, according to him, the differing accounts of justice that are presented by Aristotle and Hume are due to the underlying differences in their conceptual schemes. MacIntyre argues that despite their incommensurability there are various ways in which alien traditions might engage one another rationally ‚Äì most especially via a form of immanent critique which makes use of empathetic imagination to then put the rival tradition into \\"epistemic crisis\\" but also by being able to solve shared or analogous problems and dilemmas from within one's own tradition which remain insoluble from the rival approach.Whose Justice? Which Rationality?, 361‚Äì362. MacIntyre's account also defends three further theses: first, that all rational human inquiry is conducted whether knowingly or not from within a tradition; second, that the incommensurable conceptual schemes of rival traditions do not entail either relativism or perspectivism; third, that although the arguments of the book are themselves attempts at universally valid insights they are nevertheless given from within a particular tradition (that of Thomist Aristotelianism) and that this need not imply any philosophical inconsistency. =Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry (1990)= Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry was first presented by MacIntyre as part of the Gifford lecture series at the University of Edinburgh in 1988 and is considered by many the third part in a trilogy of philosophical argumentation that commenced with After Virtue. As its title implies, MacIntyre's aim in this book is to examine three major rival traditions of moral inquiry on the intellectual scene today (encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional) which each in turn was given defence from a canonical piece published in the late nineteenth century (the Ninth Edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Friedrich Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals and Pope Leo XIII's Aeterni Patris, respectively). MacIntyre's book ultimately conducts a complex series of both interior and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical Thomism as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry currently on offer. His critique in chapter IX of Nietzsche's and Michel Foucault's genealogical mode as implicitly committed to an emancipatory and continuous notion of self which they cannot account for on their own terms has been of particular influence. The tradition-bound account of rational inquiry MacIntyre articulated and deployed throughout these lectures suggests reforms, explored by MacIntyre in chapter X, both for the lecture as a genre and for the university as an institution. To advance rational inquiry, MacIntyre argues that lectures ought to take account of the tradition-constituted roles both of lecturer and of student. Lecturers as members of explicitly articulated traditions should engage students, recognized as standing in various relationships to the lecturer's own and/or rival traditions, on material situated in the historically-contextualized progress of the lecturer's home tradition. In support of such lectures and of tradition-bound inquiry on the research front, universities should become forums for growing and engaging rival traditions. For students, such forums would invite intentional formation within a tradition, and support learning how to profitably confront rival traditions through imaginative participation in them. For researchers, inquiry at the frontier must advance toward holistic, inter-disciplinary accounts, at once both theoretical and practical, undertaken together by members of communities of practitioners bound together in traditions. Such tradition-bound inquiry contributes to the advancement of researchers' host traditions on their own terms. Moreover, undertaking such inquiry in a reformed university setting would support encounter among host traditions and their rivals, and thus visibility as traditions both to themselves and to others through imaginative engagement with rival perspectives. The public hosting of such engagements at suitably-reformed universities, including opportunities for agreement from complementary perspectives and for sharpening differences, would support both adjudication among the mutual claims to rational superiority among rival traditions, and initiation of students into the skill sets required to profitably join and assess such encounters. =Dependent Rational Animals (1999)= While After Virtue attempted to give an account of the virtues exclusively by recourse to social practices and the understanding of individual selves in light of \\"quests\\" and \\"traditions,\\" Dependent Rational Animals was a self-conscious effort by MacIntyre to ground virtues in an account of biology. MacIntyre writes the following of this shift in the preface to the book: \\"Although there is indeed good reason to repudiate important elements in Aristotle's biology, I now judge that I was in error in supposing an ethics independent of biology to be possible.\\"Dependent Rational Animals (Chicago: Carus Publishing, 1999) x More specifically, Dependent Rational Animals tries to make a holistic case on the basis of our best current knowledge (as opposed to an ahistorical, foundational claim) that \\"human vulnerability and disability\\" are the \\"central features of human life\\" and that Thomistic \\"virtues of dependency\\" are needed for individual human beings to flourish in their passage from stages of infancy to adulthood and old age. As MacIntyre puts it: > It is most often to others that we owe our survival, let alone our > flourishing ... It will be a central thesis of this book that the virtues > that we need, if we are to develop from our animal condition into that of > independent rational agents, and the virtues that we need, if we are to > confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and > in others, belong to one and the same set of virtues, the distinctive > virtues of dependent rational animalsDependent Rational Animals, 1, 5 Engaging with scientific texts on human biology as well as works of philosophical anthropology, MacIntyre identifies the human species as existing on a continuous scale of both intelligence and dependency with other animals such as dolphins. One of his main goals is to undermine what he sees as the fiction of the disembodied, independent reasoner who determines ethical and moral questions autonomously and what he calls the \\"illusion of self- sufficiency\\" that runs through much of Western ethics culminating in Nietzsche's √úbermensch.Dependent Rational Animals, 127 In its place he tries to show that our embodied dependencies are a definitive characteristic of our species and reveal the need for certain kinds of virtuous dispositions if we are ever to flourish into independent reasoners capable of weighing the intellectual intricacies of moral philosophy in the first place. Virtue ethics MacIntyre is a key figure in the recent surge of interest in virtue ethics, which identifies the central question of morality as having to do with the habits and knowledge concerning how to live a good life. His approach seeks to demonstrate that good judgment emanates from good character. Being a good person is not about seeking to follow formal rules. In elaborating this approach, MacIntyre understands himself to be reworking the Aristotelian idea of an ethical teleology. MacIntyre emphasises the importance of moral goods defined in respect to a community engaged in a 'practice'‚Äîwhich he calls 'internal goods' or 'goods of excellence'‚Äîrather than focusing on practice- independent obligation of a moral agent (deontological ethics) or the consequences of a particular act (utilitarianism). Before its recent resurgence, virtue ethics in European/American academia had been primarily associated with pre-modern philosophers (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas). MacIntyre has argued that Aquinas' synthesis of Augustinianism with Aristotelianism is more insightful than modern moral theories by focusing upon the telos ('end', or completion) of a social practice and of a human life, within the context of which the morality of acts may be evaluated. His seminal work in the area of virtue ethics can be found in his 1981 book, After Virtue. MacIntyre intends the idea of virtue to supplement, rather than replace, moral rules. Indeed, he describes certain moral rules as 'exceptionless' or unconditional. MacIntyre considers his work to be outside \\"virtue ethics\\" due to his affirmation of virtues as embedded in specific, historically grounded, social practices.MacIntyre, ‚ÄúOn having survived the academic moral philosophy of the twentieth century‚Äù, lecture of March 2009 Politics Politically, MacIntyre's ethics informs a defence of the Aristotelian 'goods of excellence' internal to practices against the modern pursuit of 'external goods', such as money, power, and status, that are characteristic of rule-based, utilitarian, Weberian modern institutions. He has been described as a 'revolutionary Aristotelian' because of his attempt to combine historical insights from his Marxist past with those of Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle after MacIntyre's conversion to Catholicism. For him, liberalism and postmodern consumerism not only justify capitalism but also sustain and inform it over the long term. At the same time, he says that \\"Marxists have always fallen back into relatively straightforward versions of Kantianism or utilitarianism\\" and criticises Marxism as just another form of radical individualism. He says about Marxists that \\"as they move towards power they always tend to become Weberians.\\" Informed by that critique, Aristotelianism loses its sense of elitist complacency; moral excellence ceases to be part of a particular, historical practice in ancient Greece and becomes a universal quality of those who understand that good judgment emanates from good character. It has been argued that MacIntyre's thought is unable to provide a coherent and effective model for a justifiable and politically stable political order because of its neglect of political theology. In 1951 in student debates at Manchester MacIntyre described himself as a Disraeli Tory but later was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (leaving in 1956), briefly of the Socialist Labour League, and later of the Socialist Review Group/International Socialists.. Religion MacIntyre converted to Roman Catholicism in the early 1980s, and now does his work against the background of what he calls an \\"Augustinian Thomist approach to moral philosophy.\\" In an interview with Prospect, MacIntyre explains that his conversion to Catholicism occurred in his fifties as a \\"result of being convinced of Thomism while attempting to disabuse his students of its authenticity.\\". Also, in his book Whose Justice, Which Rationality? there is a section towards the end that is perhaps autobiographical when he explains how one is chosen by a tradition and may reflect his own conversion to Roman Catholicism.Whose Justice, Which Rationality? 1988, pp. 393‚Äì95. Parallel recent developments in the methods of philosophical research, which carry resonances with MacIntyre's take on Thomism, are witnessed with a modern approach to Avicennism (the historical legacies that were built upon the philosophy of Avicenna or Ibn Sina) as embodied in the works of Nader El-Bizri in connection with Islam, even though the orientation is phenomenological instead of being analytic, and the focus is on ontology rather than moral philosophy. Fuller accounts of MacIntyre's view of the relationship between philosophy and religion in general and Thomism and Catholicism in particular can be found in his essays \\"Philosophy recalled to its tasks\\" and \\"Truth as a good\\" (both found in the collection The Tasks of Philosophy) as well as in the survey of the Catholic philosophical tradition he gives in God, Philosophy and Universities.The Tasks of Philosophy: Selected Essays, Vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006); God, Philosophy and Universities (Plymouth, UK: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2009) Bibliography *1953.

Early life Gaunson was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the fourth son of Francis Gaunson and his wife Elizabeth. David Gaunson was educated in Sydney, and at Brighton, Victoria. Having served his articles to his brother-in-law, Hon. J. M. Grant, he was admitted an attorney of Victoria in 1869 and practised in Melbourne. Political career After fighting two unsuccessful contests in 1871, and in 1872 unsuccessfully opposing the Hon. J. G. Francis, the then premier, at Richmond, Gaunson was returned to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1875 for Ararat, which constituency he continued to represent until July 1881. Gaunson was a prominent member of the \\"Stonewall\\" party led by Graham Berry, which, after unparalleled agitation in Parliament and in the country, ultimately annihilated the followers of Sir James McCulloch at the general election in 1877. Subsequently, however, Gaunson acted in opposition to Berry, and also opposed the Service Government formed in 1880. In the following year, on the formation of the O'Loghlen Ministry, Gaunson accepted a portfolio as President of the Board of Lands and Works and Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey. However, on presenting himself for re-election after his acceptance of office, he was defeated in Ararat by the Hon. William Wilson, and had to resign his position in the Ministry, which he had only held from 9 July to 2 August. He was elected to the seat of Emerald Hill in October 1883. He was returned to the Assembly at the general election in March 1886, but on his contesting Melbourne South at the next general election in March 1889, he was defeated by William Mountain. In June 1904, Gaunson was elected to represent Public Officers in the Assembly, serving until December 1906. He also unsuccessfully contested Assembly elections for Emerald Hill in 1892, Carlton in 1900 and East Melbourne in 1907. Ned Kelly case Gaunson claimed to have found a loophole in the prosecution case whereby Kelly was not guilty of murder as the police unit attacking him was out to kill him and thus Kelly fired in self-defence. This argument was not carried by the defence lawyer in the actual trial and Kelly went to hang. Involvement with John Wren At the dawn of the 20th century, Gaunson became involved with John Wren, a businessman who ran an illegal tote in the working class suburb of Collingwood, Melbourne. The police eventually caught up with Wren who went to Gaunson for help. What happened is not clear, but Gaunson managed to get the police off Wren's back. Gaunson advised Wren on the best ways to cover-up his illegal betting activities. His alleged role in the Wren machine is referred to in the Frank Hardy novel, Power Without Glory, in which the character \\"Garside\\" is clearly based on Gaunson. Gaunson remained a controversial political and legal figure throughout his life. His contemporary, Alfred Deakin, described him as \\"endowed with a musical voice, good presence, fine flow of language, great quickness of mind, readiness of retort and a good deal of industry, ability and humour, ... only disqualified from marked successes by his utter instability, egregious egotism, want of consistency and violence of temper\\".

Some recipes call for sweetened condensed milk. Macaroons are sometimes baked on edible rice paper placed on a baking tray.  Etymology  The name \\"macaroon\\" comes from the Italian maccarone or maccherone meaning \\"paste\\", referring to the original almond paste ingredient; this word itself derives from ammaccare, meaning \\"to crush\\". Origins Culinary historians write that macaroons can be traced to an Italian monastery of the 8th or 9th century. The monks came to France in 1533, joined by the pastry chefs of Catherine de' Medici, wife of King Henry II. Later, two Benedictine nuns, Sister Marguerite and Sister Marie-Elisabeth, came to Nancy seeking asylum during the French Revolution. The two women paid for their housing by baking and selling macaroon cookies, and thus became known as the \\"Macaroon Sisters\\". Italian Jews later adopted the cookie because it has no flour or leavening (macaroons are leavened by egg whites) and can be eaten during the eight-day observation of Passover. It was introduced to other European Jews and became popular as a year-round sweet. Recipes for macaroons appear in recipe books at least as early as 1725 (Robert Smith's Court Cookery, or the Complete English Cook), and use egg whites and almond paste. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management includes a typical traditional recipe. Over time, coconut was added to the ground almonds and, in certain recipes, replaced them. Potato starch is also sometimes included in the recipe, to give the macaroons more body. Regional varieties =Dominican Republic= Macaroons in the Dominican Republic are very dark. Grated coconut is mixed with ginger and cinnamon. =France= There are many regional variations of French macaroon.The coconut macaroon is known as the \\"Congolais\\", or \\"le rocher √† la noix de coco\\". =India= Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu and Mangaluru in Karnataka have their own varieties of macaroon made with cashews and egg whites, adapted from those introduced in colonial times. =Ireland= A macaroon chocolate bar is made by Wilton Candy in Co. Kildare, Ireland. The description on the packaging is \\"macaroon pieces in Irish milk chocolate.\\" It was first made in 1937. Cleeve's Irish Confectionery also make a macaroon chocolate bar - ingredients include cocoa butter, milk powder and desiccated coconut. =Italy= Ricciarelli are a soft almond variety originating from Siena. Amaretti di Saronno are a usually crunchy variety from Saronno. Both are often served on special occasions such as Christmas. =Philippines= Philippine coconut macaroons Philippine coconut macaroons are uniquely cake-like in texture. They are slightly crunchy on the outside and soft, moist, and chewy on the inside. They are usually baked into colorful tiny cupcake wrappers and topped with a raisin. They are popular during holidays and special occasions. =Puerto Rico= In Puerto Rico, coconut macaroons are called besitos de coco (little coconut kisses). A few variations of besitos de coco can be found on the island, the most popular ones including lemon zest and vanilla as additional ingredients. =Scotland= Macaroon chocolate bars are also popular in Scotland. Buchanan's make a macaroon with Belgian chocolate and toasted coconut. They are a long-established family business based in Greenock. Scottish Macaroon is made with a paste of potato and sugar. Buchanan's Macaroon Bar =Spain= The carajito is a macaroon variant made with hazelnuts and honey from the town of Salas, Asturias in northern Spain. A larger size version is commonly known as sultana or suspiros del moro. =Turkey= Acƒ±badem kurabiyesi is a traditional Turkish variety made of almonds, sugar and egg whites. The traditional recipes include a small amount of bitter almonds, which gives this cookie its name. Because bitter almonds are not readily available, almond extract is typically used as a substitute. These cookies are part of the stock-in trade of almost every bakery in Turkey, as they are seldom made at home. =United Kingdom= In Britain generally, the traditional almond macaroon often includes almond essence to strengthen the flavour, and is topped with an almond flake. Coconut macaroons are also popular. In Scotland, the Scottish macaroon has a dense, sugary centre and is covered in chocolate and roasted coconut. Traditionally they were made with cold leftovers of mashed potatoes and sugar loaf. When the macaroon bar became commercial the recipe no longer used mashed potato because of shelf life limitations. The modern macaroon is made from a combination (depending on producer) of sugar, glucose, water and egg white. These ingredients make a fondant centre. This recipe was reportedly discovered by accident in Coatbridge in 1931, when confectioner John Justice Lees was said to have botched the formula for making a chocolate fondant bar and threw coconut over it in disgust, producing the first macaroon bar. =United States= Coconut macaroons Coconut macaroon is the best known variety in America. Commercially made coconut macaroons are generally dense, moist and sweet, and often dipped in chocolate. Homemade macaroons and varieties produced by smaller bakeries are commonly light and fluffy. Macaroons made with coconuts are often piped out with a star shaped tip, whereas macaroons made with nuts are more likely shaped individually due to the stiffness of the dough. Because of their lack of wheat and leavening ingredients, macaroons are often consumed during Passover in many Jewish homes.

It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1970. Macroscope was first published in 1969 and in some respects reflects the idealistic values of that time. The plot involves, among other things, an extension of the Peckham Experiment, mathematicians John Conway and Michael Paterson's game of sprouts, astrology, the poetry of Sidney Lanier, the history of Phoenicia, and commentary on the value of a dedicated teacher of a subject contrasted with a practicing engineer of that subject attempting to teach it, all in a kaleidoscopic combination. The book fills a unique place in Anthony's work as one that has garnered good reviews from hard-core science fiction fans as well as his usual audience of fantasy fans.  Plot  The central plot device is the \\"macroscope\\", a large crystal that can be used to focus a newly discovered type of particle, the \\"macron\\". Macrons are not subject to many of the effects that interfere with light, and as a result the macroscope can focus on any location in space-time with exceptional clarity, producing what is essentially a telescope of infinite resolution in the space- time continuum. The macroscope has been built into a solar-orbiting space station where scientists visit to book time on the device. Using it, they are able to explore space like never before. Among their many discoveries are numerous planets and two intelligent alien races. Using the macroscope, observers were able to look into one race's historical records, finding numerous parallels with human life on Earth. The race is now in societal decline, and the implications are worrying. The macroscope's clear view across space also makes it an ideal communications system for intelligent races, who broadcast signals by generating macrons, a technique not yet understood on Earth. However, over-riding all of these signals is another of enormous power, one of such strength that it must have been constructed by a Type II civilization. This signal repeats itself, starting with instructions on basic math and progressing to ever-more complex information. Viewers with high enough intelligence, an IQ of 150, reach a point where the information causes them to go insane or die. Those without the intelligence to understand the advanced portions of the signal are unaffected. The signal appears to be a deliberate attempt to \\"jam\\" macroscopic communications, blocking those with the ability to understand the other signals from being able to see them. They refer to the blocking signal simply as the \\"destroyer\\". The protagonist of the story, Ivo Archer, is taken to the macroscope station on the invitation of a childhood friend, Brad Carpenter. Ivo has an unexplained link to a mysterious hyper-intelligent character, Sch√∂n, and Brad believes Sch√∂n may be able to break through the destroyer signal. Ivo is not so convinced, and is reluctant to ask for Sch√∂n's help. This reluctance is cause for some misunderstanding with Brad's girlfriend, Afra Summerfield, with whom Ivo falls hopelessly in love. While inadvertently viewing the destroyer signal with Brad and a Senator visiting the project, only Ivo survives the experience. Afra concludes Ivo is not intelligent enough to be affected, and finds him somewhat beneath her as a result. The Senator's death sparks a series of events that lead to Ivo, Afra and two other station members, Harold and Beatryx, stealing the macroscope. Afra, still in love with Brad and hoping to find a cure, brings his body along, now in a vegetative state. They detach the macroscope from the station and fly off with it while United Nations ships give chase. With time on their hands, Ivo turns to the macroscope and finds a way to avoid being overwhelmed by the destroyer signal. This reveals a number of broadcasts from farther out in space. Ivo demonstrates this technique to the others, allowing Harold and Afra to view the signals formerly being hidden. Harold, a talented engineer, uses the information from one of the signals to build a device reducing their bodies to a liquid state, allowing them to accelerate at 10 g and escape the pursuing ships. They travel to Neptune space, following a cryptic message left by Sch√∂n. Here they set up camp on Triton. Afra attempts to cure Brad by shocking him while he is being reconstituted from the liquid state, but the attempt fails and Brad is killed. Over time, and with further help from Ivo, the group watches a benign form of the entire broadcast, which they come to call \\"traveller\\". The liquefaction technique is only the first of many shown in the traveller signal, which describes an entire suite of technologies that allow interstellar travel. Using the instructions in the signal, they convert Neptune into an interstellar spaceship. Sch√∂n briefly makes his first appearance during construction, revealing himself to be an alternate personality within Ivo's brain. Sch√∂n is ostensibly the body's \\"owner\\", having created the Ivo personality to avoid being the subject of experimentation. Sch√∂n has frightening intelligence, but having given over his body to Ivo at the age of five, is still a child and largely without morals. In an attempt to take control of the body, Sch√∂n traps Ivo in a historical drama running in his own brain. Over time, Ivo sees parallels between the characters in the drama and the group in the ship, and eventually escapes the illusion and re-asserts control. The group decides to hunt down the source of the destroyer signal in an effort to turn it off. Travelling 15,000 light years from Earth, they find it is being broadcast from an abandoned space station. Exploring the inner portions of the station, which is a large museum, they are individually drawn into a series of visions that reveal different aspects of the nature of the destroyer and its history. The traveller signal had arrived relatively late in the history of the galaxy, in the midst of flourishing communications via macroscope. Armed with the ability for interstellar travel, wars broke out that destroyed countless civilizations. The destroyer station, one of six in the galaxy, was set up to prevent this until the races reached the required level of cultural sophistication, if they ever did. Emerging from one of these visions, Afra discovers that Sch√∂n has once again taken over from Ivo. Intelligent enough that the signal would kill him, he has solved this problem via surgery that altered his brain chemistry to block most of the signal. This took six months to complete, keeping him \\"pinned\\" during the interval. Sch√∂n plays a game with Afra, now the only other surviving member of the original group, with the stakes being that the winner gets to select who, Sch√∂n or Ivo, gets the body. During the game, the real reason for Ivo's creation comes forth; the original Ivo was a girl with intelligence similar to Sch√∂n's, a situation neither could tolerate. After murdering her during a game played to the death with rules only the two of them could comprehend, Sch√∂n created the new Ivo to escape the retribution of his peers. Playing the game by the rules and losing, Afra instead tricks Sch√∂n into the room broadcasting the destroyer signal. Here it is so powerful that it overwhelms Sch√∂n's surgical blocks, and Ivo is able to take control. Now in command of his own personality, along with all of Sch√∂n's intellectual capacity, Ivo wins Afra's heart. At the end of the story the reader is left to decide whether or not the people of Earth are mature enough and ready for interstellar travel. Themes Macroscope's story is interwoven by many themes taken from a variety of sources. Among these are references to the personality traits each of the four members of the group embody. Harold is a student of astrology, and through his character each of the group member's signs are revealed; Ivo is a fire sign, Afra earth, Harold air, and Beatryx water. At several points, Anthony mentions that only the four together, acting as a unit, can solve the problems presented to them. These traits are explored throughout the book, but especially during the closing sequences, where they form the basis of the game between Afra and Sch√∂n.Brigg Anthony also explores the concepts of logic and understanding, especially through Afra. Her attempt to revive Brad had no hope of succeeding, something she was aware of, but ignored. During a mock trial following Brad's death, Harold explores the differences between emotion and logic, demonstrating that Afra's deliberate clamping down of her emotions led her to subvert logic. This is again explored later in the book, as Sch√∂n battles her. Anthony also uses Ivo as a stand-in for Sidney Lanier, a poet. Portions of Lanier's poetry are used throughout the book, and in other cases passages of the book closely reflect themes in Lanier's work. Through flashbacks throughout the book, Lanier's life is explored. Next to last, Brad and Ivo/Sch√∂n both come from a special project in Philadelphia clearly modelled in some ways on Britain's Peckham Experiment, initiated during the Great Depression. That project showed the great benefits of most improvements of overall health care in a community context, not just for the clinical health of the participants, but the effectiveness of the Peckham social milieu on reducing social problems, in particular, poverty. Finally, the overarching theme of the book explores mankind's potential for self-destruction, seen both through the example of the \\"prob\\" race as well as an exploration of humanity. Early in the book Brad complains that the population of 5 billion is unsustainable unless mankind reaches the stars, but he doubts their ability and maturity to do so. This theme is covered throughout the work, including the closing sentence.

Established in 1884, it is based in Commercial Street, Spitalfields, and was the first university-affiliated institution of the worldwide Settlement movement‚Äîa reformist social agenda that strove to get the rich and poor to live more closely together in an interdependent community. It was founded by Henrietta and Samuel Barnett in the economically depressed East End, and was named in memory of their friend and fellow reformer, Oxford historian Arnold Toynbee, who had died the previous year. Toynbee Hall continues to strive to bridge the gap between people of all social and financial backgrounds, with a focus on working towards a future without poverty. History Shortly after their marriage in 1873, Samuel Barnett and his wife, Henrietta, moved to the Whitechapel district of the East End of London.https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/settlement-houses/toynbee-hall/ Barnett worked as a vicar at St Jude's church, where he saw poverty at first hand. Late-Victorian Whitechapel was known for its overcrowded living spaces and high criminal activity. In the area of Whitechapel alone, the mortality rate for children under the age of five was around 60% mostly due to the tight living conditions. Charles Booth, another social reformer, mapped London according to eight different social classes, finding that around 70% of people living in the East End were in the lowest three classes. Map of Whitechapel from Charles Booth's Labour and Life of the People (1889). Residential buildings are coloured to represent the economic class of the occupants: Yellow (‚ÄúUpper-middle and Upper classes, Wealthy‚Äù), red (\\"Lower middle class ‚Äì Well-to-do middle class\\"), pink (\\"Fairly comfortable good ordinary earnings\\"), blue (\\"Intermittent or casual earnings\\"), and black (\\"lowest class...occasional labourers, street sellers, loafers, criminals and semi- criminals\\"). Toynbee Hall (not named) stands towards the southern end of Commercial Street. Whitechapel was also a place where many different immigrants settled. The Great Famine of Ireland in the 19th century led to many Irish settling in Whitechapel. Also, many Jewish immigrants settled in Whitechapel after fleeing from persecution in Western Europe at the time. The Barnetts used their roles in the parish to improve the Whitechapel area. They built a church library, introduced art exhibits, brought university lecturers in, and took their parishioners on excursions to the homes of the wealthy and to universities.The Barnetts also tried to encourage officials to improve sanitation and housing and to build more playgrounds and washhouses. However, the attempts the Barnetts made with the parish had little effect on the East End community as a whole. The parish did not reach everyone that lived in the East End. Many of the people did not involve themselves with the established church. In an effort to improve the wellbeing of the community, Barnett had the idea of sharing knowledge and culture. His proposal was to have university students come as volunteers to share their knowledge: the students would be able to help the poor, and at the same time witness poverty at first hand, and potentially develop solutions for it. In 1883, Barnett gave a lecture at St John's College, Oxford to gain support for his idea. Barnett was able to gather enough support and a committee called the \\"University Settlement of East London\\" was set up by Oxford. With these ideas and the support of universities, Barnett founded Toynbee Hall, the first settlement house in the world. Named after another social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, Toynbee Hall first opened its doors on Christmas Eve in 1884. Samuel Barnett was named as the first warden of the hall and Oxford and Cambridge university students came to work at the hall. By 1910 more settlement houses were founded in England in the areas of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Birmingham, Liverpool, and elsewhere in London; as well as in Holland, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Austria, and the United States. In 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements. One of the best known settlement houses that was inspired after a visit to Toynbee Hall is Hull House in Chicago, founded by Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr in 1889. Over time Toynbee Hall implemented many different educational community programmes. At its opening, Toynbee Hall introduced University Extension Society lectures. These lectures were taught by university professors. At the programme's peak, in the 1890s, classes were taught in over 134 topics including; literature, zoology, ethics, philosophy, etc. In order to further promote education, 36 societies or clubs were created in different areas, such as, music, art, history, and science. One of these societies was founded in 1889 and was called the \\"Toynbee Travellers\\". This group was created after a group of Toynbee Hall residents travelled to Belgium in 1887. Toynbee Hall also began hosting Smoking Room Debates in which community members and invited speakers would come to debate issues of the day. This tradition continued for over twenty years. In 1899, the Poor Man's Lawyer service was introduced. This programme gives free legal services to those who can not afford it, and continues to the present day. The Settlement movement Dorset Street, Spitalfields), photographed for Jack London's book The People of the Abyss The international Settlement movement began at Toynbee Hall, where a community centre was formed that attracted university students who wished to live or \\"settle\\" among the underprivileged in London's economically depressed East End. They came, according to Samuel Barnett, \\"to learn, as much as to teach, to receive as much as to give\\". As at most Settlement houses, its social workers‚Äîstudents from Oxford and Cambridge Universities, among others‚Äîresided at Toynbee Hall and sought thereby to get to know their neighbors and their needs on a more intimate, personal level.Article in the 'University Review' 919050, quoted in H. O. Barnett, op. cit., p.311 Toynbee Hall rejected the concept of a community centre as a location for Christian proselytisingas seen in the efforts of the Salvation Army. This principle is reflected in the decision to name it after the social reformer, Arnold Toynbee, who had died in 1883, aged 30. As Henrietta Barnett explained, the name would be \\"free from every possible savor of a mission.\\" From the beginning, it was non-sectarian and welcomed people of all faiths, despite having been founded by a Church of England cleric. It saw its purpose as more educational than charitable, in a missionary sense. Gertrude Himmelfarb lists some of the activities offered by Toynbee Hall in a typical month: \\"evening classes on arithmetic, writing, drawing, citizenship, chemistry, nursing, and music (...); afternoon classes for girls on dressmaking, writing and composition, geography, bookkeeping, needlework, hygiene, reading and recitation, French, singing, cooking, and swimming; and evening sessions devoted to the discussion of legal principles and current social issues\\". By 1900 there were over 100 settlements in the United States and across the UK,National Federation of Settlements accessed 10 July 2013 and in 1911 the leaders of the social settlement movement founded the National Federation of Settlements.Social Welfare History website. Current activity Today, Toynbee Hall provides a range of programmes and activities, broadly broken down into: youth, the elderly, financial inclusion, debt, advice, free legal advice and community engagement. Each year over 400 volunteers help to deliver the charity's services. In 2006 Toynbee Hall launched Capitalise, a pan-London free debt advice service to support 20,000 people a year with their money worries. In April 2019 this service was rebranded as Debt Free London. In 2007 the Toynbee Studios opened in part of the building offering dance and media studios and a theatre.

Bourdain was a 1978 graduate of The Culinary Institute of America and a veteran of a number of professional kitchens in his long career, which included many years spent as an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in Manhattan. He first became known for his bestselling book Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (2000). His first food and world-travel television show A Cook's Tour ran for 35 episodes on the Food Network in 2002 and 2003. In 2005, he began hosting the Travel Channel's culinary and cultural adventure programs Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations (2005‚Äì2012) and The Layover (2011‚Äì2013). In 2013, he began a three-season run as a judge on The Taste, and concurrently switched his travelogue programming to CNN to host Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. Though best known for his culinary writings and television presentations, along with several books on food and cooking and travel adventures, Bourdain also wrote both fiction and historical nonfiction. On June 8, 2018, Bourdain died by suicide while on location in France for Parts Unknown. Early life Anthony Michael Bourdain was born in New York City on June 25, 1956, the oldest of two sons of Gladys (n√©e Sacksman) and Pierre Bourdain.Mack, Patricia. \\"The Cook, The Thief...\\", The Record (Bergen County), October 25, 2000; accessed March 30, 2011. \\"Anthony Bourdain, the Leonia native with the French-sounding name, took a leave from his job as an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in New York City.\\" Although he was not raised in a specified religion, his father was Catholic, while his mother was Jewish. Bourdain stated that, though he was considered Jewish by Judaism's definition, \\"I've never been in a synagogue. I don't believe in a higher power. But that doesn't make me any less Jewish, I don't think.\\" His family was not religious either. At the time of Bourdain's birth, Pierre was a salesman at a New York City camera store, as well as a floor manager at a record store. He later became an executive for Columbia Records, and Gladys was a staff editor at The New York Times. Bourdain's paternal grandparents were French; his paternal grandfather emigrated from Arcachon to New York following World War I.A Cook's Tour, episode 1.9: \\"Childhood Flavors\\"; 2000Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 5.4: \\"Uruguay\\"; July 28, 2008 Bourdain's father spent summers in France as a boy and grew up speaking French. Bourdain spent most of his childhood in Leonia, New Jersey. In a 2014 interview, Bourdain talked about how in the 1960s, after seeing films, he would go to a restaurant afterwards with friends to discuss the film. In his youth, Bourdain was a member of the Boy Scouts of America. Culinary training and career Bourdain's love of food was kindled in his youth while on a family vacation in France when he tried his first oyster on a fisherman's boat. He graduated from the Dwight-Englewood School‚Äîan independent coeducational college-preparatory day school in Englewood, New Jersey‚Äîin 1973, then enrolled at Vassar College, but dropped out after two years. He worked in seafood restaurants in Provincetown, Massachusetts, while attending Vassar, which inspired his decision to pursue cooking as a career. Bourdain attended The Culinary Institute of America, graduating in 1978. From there he went on to run various restaurant kitchens in New York City, including the Supper Club, One Fifth Avenue, and Sullivan's. In 1988, Bourdain became an executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles. Based in Manhattan, at the time the brand had additional restaurants in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Tokyo. Bourdain remained an executive chef there for many years, and, even when no longer formally employed at Les Halles, maintained a relationship with the restaurant, which described him in January 2014 as their \\"chef at large.\\" Les Halles closed in 2017, after filing for bankruptcy. Media career =Writing= In the mid-1980s, Bourdain began submitting unsolicited work for publication to Between C & D, a literary magazine of the Lower East Side. The magazine eventually published a piece that Bourdain had written about a chef who was trying to purchase heroin in the Lower East Side. In 1985, Bourdain signed up for a writing workshop with Gordon Lish. In 1990, Bourdain received a small book advance from Random House, after meeting a Random House editor. His first book, a culinary mystery Bone in the Throat, was published in 1995. He paid for his own book tour, but he did not find success. His second mystery book, Gone Bamboo, also performed poorly in sales. Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly (2000), a New York Times bestseller, was an expansion of his 1999 New Yorker article \\"Don't Eat Before Reading This.\\" A prequel to the book, Medium Raw: A Bloody Valentine to the World of Food and the People Who Cook, was published in 2010. He wrote two more bestselling nonfiction books: A Cook's Tour (2001), an account of his food and travel exploits around the world, written in conjunction with his first television series of the same title, and The Nasty Bits (2006), another collection of essays centered on food. His additional books include Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles Cookbook, a hypothetical historical investigation Typhoid Mary: An Urban Historical, and No Reservations: Around the World on an Empty Stomach. His articles and essays appeared in many publications, including in The New Yorker, The New York Times, The Times of London, the Los Angeles Times, The Observer, Gourmet, Maxim, and Esquire (UK) magazines; Scotland on Sunday, The Face, Food Arts, Limb by Limb, BlackBook, The Independent, Best Life, the Financial Times, and Town & Country. His blog for the third season of Top Chef was nominated for a Webby Award for Best Blog (in the Cultural/Personal category) in 2008. In 2012, Bourdain co-wrote the original graphic novel Get Jiro! along with Joel Rose; its art was by Langdon Foss. In 2015, Bourdain joined the travel, food, and politics publication Roads & Kingdoms as the site's sole investor and editor-at-large. Over the next several years, Bourdain contributed to the site and edited the Dispatched By Bourdain series. Bourdain and Roads & Kingdoms also partnered on the digital series Explore Parts Unknown, which launched in 2017 and won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Nonfiction or Reality Series in 2018. =Television= As series host Bourdain's principal occupation between 2002 until his death in 2018 was a series of food and travel shows. Bourdain described the concept as, \\"I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do whatever the fuck I want\\". Nigella Lawson noted that Bourdain had an, \\"incredibly beautiful style when he talks that ranges from erudite to brilliantly slangy\\". =A Cook's Tour (2002‚Äì2003)= The acclaim surrounding Bourdain's memoir Kitchen Confidential led to an offer by the Food Network for him to host his own food and world-travel show, A Cook's Tour, which premiered in January 2002. It ran for 35 episodes, through 2003. =No Reservations (2005‚Äì2012)= In July 2005, he premiered a new, somewhat similar television series, Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, on the Travel Channel. As a further result of the immense popularity of Kitchen Confidential, the Fox sitcom Kitchen Confidential aired in 2005, in which the character Jack Bourdain is based loosely on Anthony Bourdain's biography and persona. In July 2006, he and his crew were in Beirut filming an episode of No Reservations when the Israel-Lebanon conflict broke out unexpectedly after the crew had filmed only a few hours of footage for the food and travel show. His producers compiled behind-the-scenes footage of him and his production staff, including not only their initial attempts to film the episode, but also their firsthand encounters with Hezbollah supporters, their days of waiting for news with other expatriates in a Beirut hotel, and their eventual escape aided by a fixer (unseen in the footage), whom Bourdain dubbed Mr. Wolf after Harvey Keitel's character in Pulp Fiction. Bourdain and his crew were finally evacuated with other American citizens, on the morning of July 20, by the United States Marine Corps. The Beirut No Reservations episode, which aired on August 21, 2006, was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2007. =The Layover (2011‚Äì2013)= The Travel Channel announced in July 2011 that it would be adding a second one-hour, 10-episode Bourdain show to be titled The Layover, which premiered November 21, 2011. Each episode featured an exploration of a city that can be undertaken within an air travel layover of 24 to 48 hours. The series ran for 20 episodes, through February 2013. Bourdain executive produced a similar show hosted by celebrities called The Getaway, which lasted two seasons on Esquire Network. =Parts Unknown (2013‚Äì2018)= Bourdain with his Peabody Award in 2014 In May 2012, Bourdain announced that he would be leaving the Travel Channel. In December he explained on his blog that his departure was due to his frustration with the channel's new ownership using his voice and image to make it seem as if he were endorsing a car brand, and the channel's creating three \\"special episodes\\" consisting solely of clips from the seven official episodes of that season. He went on to host Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown for CNN. The program focuses on other cuisines, cultures and politics and premiered April 14, 2013. President Barack Obama was featured on the program in an episode filmed in Vietnam that aired in September 2016. The two talked over a beer at a local Vietnamese restaurant. The show was filmed and is set in places as diverse as Libya, Tokyo, the Punjab region, Jamaica, Turkey, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Far West Texas and Armenia. Top Chef and other guest appearances =Food programs= Between 2012 and 2017, he served as narrator and executive producer for several episodes of the award-winning PBS series The Mind of a Chef. The series moved from PBS to Facebook Watch in 2017. From 2013 to 2015 he was an executive producer and appeared as a judge and mentor in ABC's cooking- competition show The Taste. He earned an Emmy nomination for each season. Bourdain appeared five times as guest judge on Bravo's Top Chef reality cooking competition program: first in the November 2006 \\"Thanksgiving\\" episode of Season 2, and again in June 2007 in the first episode of Season 3, judging the \\"exotic surf and turf\\" competition that featured ingredients including abalone, alligator, black chicken, geoduck and eel. His third appearance was also in Season 3, as an expert on air travel, judging the competitors' airplane meals. He also wrote weekly blog commentaries for many of the Season 3 episodes, filling in as a guest blogger while Top Chef judge Tom Colicchio was busy opening a new restaurant. He next appeared as a guest judge for the opening episode of Season 4, in which pairs of chefs competed head-to-head in the preparation of various classic dishes, and again in the Season 4 Restaurant Wars episode, temporarily taking the place of head judge Tom Colicchio, who was at a charity event. He appeared as a guest judge in episode 12 of Top Chef: D.C. (Season 7), where he judged the cheftestants' meals they made for NASA. He was also one of the main judges on Top Chef All-Stars (Top Chef, Season 8). He made a guest appearance on the August 6, 2007 New York City episode of Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern, and Zimmern himself appeared as a guest on the New York City episode of Bourdain's No Reservations airing the same day. On October 20, 2008 Bourdain hosted a special, At the Table with Anthony Bourdain, on the Travel Channel. =Other series= Bourdain appeared in an episode of TLC's reality show Miami Ink, aired on August 28, 2006, in which artist Chris Garver tattooed a skull on his right shoulder. Bourdain, who noted it was his fourth tattoo, said that one reason for the skull was that he wished to balance the ouroboros tattoo he had inked on his opposite shoulder in Malaysia, while filming Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations. He was a consultant and writer for the television series Treme. In 2010, he appeared on Nick Jr.'s Yo Gabba Gabba! as Dr. Tony. In 2011, he voiced himself in a cameo on an episode of The Simpsons titled \\"The Food Wife\\", in which Marge, Lisa, and Bart start a food blog called The Three Mouthkateers. He appeared in a 2013 episode of the animated series Archer (S04E07), voicing chef Lance Casteau, a parody of himself. In 2015, he voiced a fictionalized version of himself on an episode of Sanjay and Craig titled \\"Snake Parts Unknown\\". From 2015 to 2017, Bourdain hosted Raw Craft, a series of short videos released on YouTube. The series followed Bourdain as he visited various artisans who produce various craft items by hand, including iron skillets, suits, saxophones, and kitchen knives. The series was produced by William Grant & Sons to promote their Balvenie distillery's products. =Publishing= Ecco Press announced in September 2011 that Bourdain would have his own publishing line, Anthony Bourdain Books, which would include acquiring between three and five titles per year that \\"reflect his remarkably eclectic tastes\\". The first books that the imprint published, released in 2013, include L.A. Son: My Life, My City, My Food by Roy Choi, Tien Nguyen, and Natasha Phan, Prophets of Smoked Meat by Daniel Vaughn, and Pain Don't Hurt by Mark Miller. Bourdain also announced plans to publish a book by Marilyn Hagerty. In describing the line, he said, \\"This will be a line of books for people with strong voices who are good at something‚Äîwho speak with authority. Discern nothing from this initial list‚Äîother than a general affection for people who cook food and like food. The ability to kick people in the head is just as compelling to us‚Äîas long as that's coupled with an ability to vividly describe the experience. We are just as intent on crossing genres as we are enthusiastic about our first three authors. It only gets weirder from here.\\" Shortly after Bourdain's death, HarperCollins announced the publishing line would shut down after the remaining works under contract are published. =Film= Bourdain appeared as himself in the 2015 film The Big Short, in which he used seafood stew as an analogy for a collateralized debt obligation. He also produced and starred in Wasted! The Story of Food Waste. Public persona Bourdain in 2007 Drew Magary, in a column for GQ, reflected that Bourdain was heir in spirit to Hunter S. Thompson. The Smithsonian Institution declared Bourdain \\"the original rock star\\" of the culinary world, while his public persona was characterized by Gothamist as \\"culinary bad boy\\". Due to his liberal use of profanity and sexual references in his television show No Reservations, the network added viewer-discretion advisories to each episode. Bourdain was known for consuming exotic local specialty dishes, having eaten black-colored blood sausages called mustamakkara in FinlandAL: Julkkiskokki ahmaisi puoli kiloa mustaamakkaraa (in Finnish)IS: Anthony Bourdain rakastui Suomen vierailullaan mielipiteit√§ jakavaan perinneruokaan: ‚ÄùGood stuff!‚Äù (in Finnish) and also \\"sheep testicles in Morocco, ant eggs in Puebla, Mexico, a raw seal eyeball as part of a traditional Inuit seal hunt, and an entire cobra‚Äîbeating heart, blood, bile, and meat‚Äîin Vietnam\\". Bourdain was quoted as saying that a Chicken McNugget was the most disgusting thing he ever ate, despite his fondness for Popeyes chicken. He also declared that the unwashed warthog rectum he ate in NamibiaAnthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 3.4: \\"Namibia\\"; January 22, 2007 was \\"the worst meal of [his] life\\", along with the fermented shark he ate in Iceland.Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 1.2: \\"Iceland\\"; August 1, 2005 Bourdain was noted for his put-downs of celebrity chefs, such as Paula Deen, Bobby Flay, Guy Fieri, Sandra Lee, and Rachael Ray, and appeared irritated by both the overt commercialism of the celebrity cooking industry and its lack of culinary authenticity. He voiced a \\"serious disdain for food demigods like Alan Richman, Alice Waters, and Alain Ducasse.\\" Bourdain recognized the irony of his transformation into a celebrity chef and began to qualify his insults; in the 2007 New Orleans episode of No Reservations, he reconciled with Emeril Lagasse.Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 4.5: \\"New Orleans\\"; February 4, 2008 He was outspoken in his praise for chefs he admired, particularly Ferran Adri√†, Juan Mari Arzak, Fergus Henderson, Jos√© Andr√©s, Thomas Keller, Martin Picard, √âric Ripert, and Marco Pierre White, as well as his former proteg√© and colleagues at Brasserie Les Halles.Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, episode 4.10: \\"Into the Fire\\"; March 10, 2008 He spoke very highly of Julia Child's influence on him. Bourdain was known for his sarcastic comments about vegan and vegetarian activists, considering their lifestyle \\"rude\\" to the inhabitants of many countries he visited. He considered vegetarianism, except in the case of religious exemptions, a \\"First World luxury\\". However, he also believed that Americans eat too much meat, and admired vegetarians and vegans who put aside their beliefs when visiting different cultures in order to be respectful of their hosts. Bourdain's book, The Nasty Bits, is dedicated to \\"Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee\\" of the Ramones. He declared fond appreciation for their music, as well that of other early punk bands such as Dead Boys, and The Voidoids. He said that the playing of music by Billy Joel, Elton John, or the Grateful Dead in his kitchen was grounds for firing. Joel was a fan of Bourdain's, and visited the restaurant. On No Reservations and Parts Unknown, he dined with and interviewed many musicians, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, with a special focus on glam and punk rockers such as Alice Cooper, David Johansen, Marky Ramone and Iggy Pop. He featured contemporary band Queens of the Stone Age on No Reservations several times, and they composed and performed the theme song for Parts Unknown. Personal life Bourdain married his high school girlfriend, Nancy Putkoski, in 1985, and they remained together for two decades, divorcing in 2005. On April 20, 2007, he married Ottavia Busia, a mixed martial artist. The couple's daughter, Ariane, was born in 2007. Bourdain said having to be away from his family for 250 days a year working on his television shows was a strain. Busia appeared in several episodes of No Reservations, notably the ones in her birthplace of Sardinia, Tuscany, Rome, Rio de Janeiro and Naples. The couple separated in 2016. In 2017, Bourdain began a relationship with the Italian actress Asia Argento, who he met when she appeared on the Rome episode of Parts Unknown. Bourdain practiced the martial art Brazilian jiu-jitsu, earning a blue belt in August 2015. He won gold at the IBJJF New York Spring International Open Championship in 2016, in the Middleweight Master 5 (age 51 and older) division. Bourdain was known to be a heavy smoker. In a nod to Bourdain's two- pack-a-day cigarette habit, Thomas Keller once served him a 20-course tasting menu which included a mid-meal ‚Äúcoffee and cigarette,‚Äù a coffee custard infused with tobacco, with a foie gras mousse. Bourdain stopped smoking in 2007 for his daughter. A former user of cocaine, heroin, and LSD, Bourdain wrote in Kitchen Confidential of his experience in a trendy SoHo restaurant in 1981, where he and his friends were often high. Bourdain said drugs influenced his decisions, and that he sent a busboy to Alphabet City to obtain cannabis, methaqualone, cocaine, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, secobarbital, tuinal, amphetamine, codeine and heroin. Death Hotel Chambard in Kaysersberg (pictured in 2015), where Bourdain was found dead In early June 2018, Bourdain was working on an episode of Parts Unknown in Strasbourg, with his frequent collaborator and friend √âric Ripert. On June 8, Ripert became worried when Bourdain had missed dinner and breakfast. He subsequently found Bourdain dead of an apparent suicide by hanging in his room at Le Chambard hotel in Kaysersberg near Colmar. Christian de Rocquigny du Fayel, the public prosecutor for Colmar, said Bourdain's body bore no signs of violence and the suicide appeared to be an impulsive act. Rocquigny du Fayel disclosed that Bourdain's toxicology results were negative for narcotics, showing only a trace of a therapeutic non-narcotic medication. Bourdain's body was cremated in France on June 13, 2018, and his ashes were returned to the United States two days later. =Reactions and tributes= Memorial at Brasserie Les HallesBourdain's mother, Gladys Bourdain, told The New York Times: \\"He is absolutely the last person in the world I would have ever dreamed would do something like this.\\" Following the news of Bourdain's death, various celebrity chefs and other public figures expressed sentiments of condolence. Among them were fellow chefs Andrew Zimmern and Gordon Ramsay, and former astronaut Scott Kelly. CNN issued a statement, saying that Bourdain's \\"talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much.\\" Former U.S. President Barack Obama, who dined with Bourdain in Vietnam on an episode of Parts Unknown, wrote on Twitter: \\"He taught us about food‚Äîbut more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown.\\" On June 8, 2018, CNN aired Remembering Anthony Bourdain, a tribute program. In the days following Bourdain's death, fans paid tribute to him outside his now-closed former place of employment, Brasserie Les Halles. Cooks and restaurant owners gathered together and held tribute dinners and memorials and donated net sales to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. In August 2018, CNN announced that it would broadcast a final, posthumous season of Parts Unknown, completing its remaining episodes using narration and additional interviews from featured guests, and two retrospective episodes paying tribute to the series and Bourdain's legacy. A collection of Bourdain's personal items were sold at auction in October 2019, raising $1.8 million, part of which is to support the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship at his alma mater, The Culinary Institute of America. The most expensive item sold was his custom Bob Kramer Steel and Meteorite Chef's knife, selling at a record $231,250. Interests and advocacy In an assessment of Bourdain's life for The Nation, David Klion wrote that, \\"Bourdain understood that the point of journalism is to tell the truth, to challenge the powerful, to expose wrongdoing. But his unique gift was to make doing all that look fun rather than grim or tedious.\\"What Bourdain Gave Us by David Klion, The Nation, June 8, 2018 According to Klion, Bourdain's shows \\"made it possible to believe that social justice and earthly delights weren't mutually exclusive, and he pursued both with the same earnest reverence.\\" Bourdain advocated for communicating the value of traditional or \\"peasant\\" foods, including all of the varietal bits and unused animal parts not usually eaten by affluent, 21st-century Americans.Bourdain, Anthony (2006). The Nasty Bits. New York: Bloomsbury. He also praised the quality of freshly prepared street food in other countries‚Äîespecially developing countries‚Äîcompared to fast-food chains in the U.S.Bourdain, Anthony (2001). A Cook's Tour: In Search of the Perfect Meal. New York: Bloomsbury. Regarding Western moral criticism of cuisine in developing countries, Bourdain stated: \\"Let's call this criticism what it is: racism. There are a lot of practices from the developing world that I find personally repellent, from my privileged Western point of view. But I don't feel like I have such a moral high ground that I can walk around lecturing people in developing nations on how they should live their lives.\\" With regard to criticism of the Chinese, Bourdain stated: \\"The way in which people dismiss whole centuries-old cultures‚Äìoften older than their own and usually non-white‚Äìwith just utter contempt aggravates me. People who suggest I shouldn't go to a country like China, look at or film it, because some people eat dog there, I find that racist, frankly. Understand people first: their economic, living situation.\\" Regarding the myth that monosodium glutamate in Chinese food is unhealthy, Bourdain said: \\"It's a lie. You know what causes Chinese restaurant syndrome? Racism. 'Ooh I have a headache; it must have been the Chinese guy.'\\" He championed industrious Spanish-speaking immigrants‚Äîfrom Mexico, Ecuador, and other Central and South American countries‚Äîwho are cooks and chefs in many U.S. restaurants, including upscale establishments, regardless of cuisine.Master chef Douglas Rodriguez, on the July 8, 2009 episode of Top Chef Masters, stated that 60% of restaurant kitchen workers in the U.S. are Latinos. He considered them talented chefs and invaluable cooks, underpaid and unrecognized even though they have become the backbone of the U.S. restaurant industry. In 2017, Bourdain became a vocal advocate against sexual harassment in the restaurant industry, speaking out about celebrity chefs Mario Batali and John Besh, and in Hollywood, particularly following his then girlfriend Asia Argento's sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Bourdain accused Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino of \\"complicity\\" in the Weinstein sex scandal.

The area, which takes its name from Paternoster Row, once centre of the London publishing trade, was devastated by aerial bombardment in The Blitz during the Second World War. It is now the location of the London Stock Exchange which relocated there from Threadneedle Street in 2004. It is also the location of investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Nomura Securities Co., and of fund manager Fidelity Investments. The square itself, i.e. the plaza, is privately owned public space. In 2004, Christopher Wren's 1669 Temple Bar Gate was re-erected here as an entrance way to the plaza. The Square is near the top of a modest rise known as Ludgate Hill, the highest part of the City of London. It is characterised by its pedestrianisation and colonnades. World War II bombing The City of London was hit by one of the heaviest night raids of The Blitz on the night of 29 December 1940. Buildings on Paternoster Row, housing the publishing companies Simpkins and Marshall, Hutchinsons, Blackwoods, and Longmans and Collins were destroyed. St Paul's Cathedral remained intact.  1960s rebuilding  In 1956, the Corporation of London published Sir William Holford's proposals for redeveloping the precinct north of St Paul's Cathedral. Holford's report attempted to resolve problems of traffic flow in the vicinity of the cathedral, while protecting the cathedral's presence as a national monument on the highest ground of the City, at the top of Ludgate Hill, on the north bank of the Thames.Pevsner, Nikolaus and Games, Stephen (ed), Pevsner: The Complete Broadcasts, \\"A Setting for St. Paul's\\", Ashgate 2014 The report was controversial, however, because it introduced a decisively modern note alongside the foremost work of Britain's foremost 17th-century architect, Sir Christopher Wren. Rebuilding was carried out between 1961‚Äì7, but it involved only part of Holford's concept ‚Äî the area of Paternoster Square between St Paul's churchyard and Newgate Street ‚Äî and this included undistinguished buildings by other architects and the omission of some of Holford's features. The new Paternoster Square soon became very unpopular, and (in the eyes of many) its grim presence immediately north of one of the capital's prime tourist attractions was seen as an embarrassment. Robert Finch, the Lord Mayor of London, wrote of it in The Guardian in 2004, that it was made up of \\"ghastly, monolithic constructions without definition or character\\".  1980s and 1990s  In the late 1980s, many existing tenants moved to other London sites leading to vacant premises. This prompted landlords and the City of London to welcome proposals to redevelop. In 1987, a body awarded a prize for a plan by Arup associates; this was not implemented as complicated, bold and postmodern. In 1990 a front-running scheme arose by John Simpson sponsored by a newspaper competition and championed by The Prince of Wales; this proposed classical features, which would have been sympathetic with the nearby cathedral. The City's architecturally more radical planners for large commercial buildings refused these plans, as pastiche, even though the scheme that was eventually realised also draws heavily from classical architecture, complete with Corinthian columns and classical mouldings. In 1996 planning permissions were granted for the masterplan by Sir William Whitfield ‚Äî then planned in detail and built. By October 2003 the redeveloped square was complete, lined with buildings by Whitfield's firm and others. Among the first new tenants was the London Stock Exchange. Occupy London and public space controversy The London Stock Exchange was the initial target for the protesters of Occupy London on 15 October 2011. Attempts to occupy Paternoster Square were thwarted by police, Police sealed off the entrance to Paternoster Square. A High Court injunction had been granted against public access to the square, defining it as private property. The square was repeatedly described as 'public space' in the plans for Paternoster Square, meaning the public is granted access but does not designate the square as a right of way under English law, thus the owner can limit access at any time. Monuments and sculpture St Paul's Cathedral dome and the Paternoster Square Column, from Paternoster Square The main monument in the redeveloped square is the 75 ft (23m) tall Paternoster Square Column.Paternoster Square Column It is a Corinthian column of Portland stone topped by a gold leaf covered flaming copper urn, which is illuminated by fibre-optic lighting at night. The column was designed by William Whitfield's firm Whitfield Partners, and also serves as a ventilation shaft for a service road that runs beneath the square. At the north end of the square is the bronze Paternoster (also known as Shepherd and Sheep) by Dame Elisabeth Frink. The statue was commissioned for the previous Paternoster Square complex in 1975, and was replaced on a new plinth following the redevelopment. Another sculpture in the square is Paternoster Vents by Thomas Heatherwick. Temple Bar Gate, a Wren- designed stone archway constructed between 1669 and 1672 on Fleet Street at Temple Bar (the historic western ceremonial entrance to the City), has been in front of the cathedral side entrance since 2004. Contractors were paid ¬£3,000,000 to restore it and move it from a site in Theobalds Park by the Corporation of London, which received donations from the Temple Bar Trust and more than one Livery Company.

He was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to August 2013, representing the Division of Hume in New South Wales. Biography =Early life= Schultz was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was a meat processing worker before entering politics. He was a field officer for the Liberal Party (1986‚Äì88) and a member of the Cootamundra Shire Council (1983‚Äì91). =Career= Schultz was the member for Burrinjuck in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1988 to 1998, before being elected to represent Hume at the 1998 federal election. He was subsequently returned at the 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010 elections. He gained national media attention in the lead up to the privatisation of Telstra claiming that he would not support the legislation but would not \\"cross the floor\\". In the end he abstained from voting on the matter. Alby Schultz was one of the several Liberal Party politicians along with Don Randall, Wilson Tuckey, Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Dennis Jensen and Sophie Mirabella, who boycotted Parliament on the day that the formal apology to the Stolen Generations was made by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Schultz apologised in June 2009 for a physical confrontation with one of his Liberal parliamentary colleagues in a party room meeting in Parliament House. He had been angered by a remark made by Chris Pearce, the member for Aston in Victoria, during a debate about whether the Liberal Party should run candidates against National Party MPs. Schultz reportedly responded by grabbing Pearce around the neck. He later apologised to Pearce and the entire party room for the incident. In September 2012 he prompted an investigation by the Department of Parliamentary Service on concern of a \\"serious security breach\\" when he became aware his private calendar became accessible on other MP's computers. The investigation determined that his own office was responsible for the error when configuring the email service, by nominating access to multiple users. Schultz retired at the 2013 Australian federal election. In 2015 he was listed as patron of the anti-wind farm lobby, the Waubra Foundation.http://waubrafoundation.org.au/about/people/ Personal In 2003 he lost an eye in an accident with hydrochloric acid while cleaning a swimming pool filter, and in 2004 received a prosthetic eye.

This can be done by comparing two files bit-by- bit, but requires two copies of the same file, and may miss systematic corruptions which might occur to both files. A more popular approach is to generate a hash of the copied file and comparing that to the hash of the original file.  Integrity verification  File integrity can be compromised, usually referred to as the file becoming corrupted. A file can become corrupted by a variety of ways: faulty storage media, errors in transmission, write errors during copying or moving, software bugs, and so on. Hash-based verification ensures that a file has not been corrupted by comparing the file's hash value to a previously calculated value. If these values match, the file is presumed to be unmodified. Due to the nature of hash functions, hash collisions may result in false positives, but the likelihood of collisions is often negligible with random corruption.  Authenticity verification  It is often desirable to verify that a file hasn't been modified in transmission or storage by untrusted parties, for example, to include malicious code such as viruses or backdoors. To verify the authenticity, a classical hash function is not enough as they are not designed to be collision resistant; it is computationally trivial for an attacker to cause deliberate hash collisions, meaning that a malicious change in the file is not detected by a hash comparison. In cryptography, this attack is called a preimage attack. For this purpose, cryptographic hash functions are employed often. As long as the hash sums cannot be tampered with -- for example, if they are communicated over a secure channel -- the files can be presumed to be intact. Alternatively, digital signatures can be employed to assure tamper resistance.  File formats  A checksum file is a small file that contains the checksums of other files. There are a few well-known checksum file formats. \\"Checksum\\". Several utilities, such as md5deep, can use such checksum files to automatically verify an entire directory of files in one operation. The particular hash algorithm used is often indicated by the file extension of the checksum file. The \\".sha1\\" file extension indicates a checksum file containing 160-bit SHA-1 hashes in sha1sum format. The \\".md5\\" file extension, or a file named \\"MD5SUMS\\", indicates a checksum file containing 128-bit MD5 hashes in md5sum format. The \\".sfv\\" file extension indicates a checksum file containing 32-bit CRC32 checksums in simple file verification format. The \\"crc.list\\" file indicates a checksum file containing 32-bit CRC checksums in brik format. As of 2012, best practice recommendations is to use SHA-2 or SHA-3 to generate new file integrity digests; and to accept MD5 and SHA1 digests for backward compatibility if stronger digests are not available. The theoretically weaker SHA1, the weaker MD5, or much weaker CRC were previously commonly used for file integrity checks.NIST. \\"NIST's policy on hash functions\\" . 2012.

CRC checksums cannot be used to verify the authenticity of files, as CRC32 is not a collision resistant hash function -- even if the hash sum file is not tampered with, it is computationally trivial for an attacker to replace a file with the same CRC digest as the original file, meaning that a malicious change in the file is not detected by a CRC comparison.

Popularly called the \\"City Summit\\", it brought together high-level representatives of national and local governments, as well as private sector, NGOs, research and training institutions and the media. Universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and human settlements safer, healthier and more livable cities, inspired by the Charter of the United Nations, were discussed and endorsed. Habitat II received its impetus from the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and General Assembly resolution A/RES/47/180. The conference outcomes were integrated in the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda, and adopted as a new global action plan to realize sustainable human settlements. The Secretary-General of the Conference was Dr. Wally N'Dow. The objectives for Habitat II were stated as: in the long term, to arrest the deterioration of global human settlements conditions and ultimately create the conditions for achieving improvements in the living environment of all people on a sustainable basis, with special attention to the needs and contributions of women and vulnerable social groups whose quality of life and participation in development have been hampered by exclusion and inequality, affecting the poor in general;to adopt a general statement of principles and commitments and formulate a related global plan of action capable of guiding national and international efforts through the first two decades of the next century. A new mandate for the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) was derived to support and monitor the implementation of the Habitat Agenda adopted at the Conference and approved by the General Assembly. Habitat III met in Quito, Ecuador, from October 17‚Äì20, 2016. Previous negotiations The organizational session of the Preparatory Committee (PrepCom) for Habitat II was held at UN Headquarters in New York from 3‚Äì5 March 1993. Delegates elected the Bureau and took decisions regarding the organization and timing of the process. The First Substantive Session of the Preparatory Committee of the PrepCom was held in Geneva from 11‚Äì22 April 1994. Delegates agreed that the overriding objective of the Conference was to increase world awareness of the problems and potentials of human settlements as important inputs to social progress and economic growth, and to commit the world's leaders to making cities, towns and villages healthy, safe, just and sustainable. The Earth Negotiations Bulletin prepared a comprehensive report on the first session of the PrepCom. The PrepCom also took decisions on the organization of the Conference and financing, in addition to the areas of: National Objectives, International Objectives, Participation, Draft Statement of Principles and Commitments and Draft Global Plan of Action. Habitat II at the 49th United Nations General Assembly The Second Committee of the UN General Assembly addressed Habitat II from 8‚Äì16 November 1994.

A draft resolution on the \\"United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II)\\" (A/C.2/49/L.27) was first tabled by the co-sponsors, Algeria, on behalf of the G-77 and China,and Turkey. After informal consultations by members of the Second Committee, the Vice Chair, Raiko Raichev (Bulgaria) submitted a new draft resolution (A/C.2/49/L.61). This resolution was adopted as orally amended by the Committee on Friday, 9 December 1994.The operative part of the resolution, as contained in L.61, took note of the reports of the PrepCom on its organizational session and first substantive session and endorsed the decisions contained therein. The resolution approved the PrepCom's recommendation that a third substantive session of the PrepCom be held at UN Headquarters early in 1996 to complete the preparatory work for the Conference.

The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. The GGC (Swat), Cemetery H, Copper Hoard and PGW cultures are candidates for cultures associated with Indo-Aryan migrations. The Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex (short BMAC), also known as the Oxus civilization, is the modern archaeological designation for a Bronze Age civilization of Central Asia, dated to c. 2400‚Äì1900 BC in its urban phase or Integration Era,Vidale, Massimo, 2017.

Its sites were discovered and named by the Soviet archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi (1976). Bactria was the Greek name for the area of Bactra (modern Balkh), in what is now northern Afghanistan, and Margiana was the Greek name for the Persian satrapy of Margu≈°, the capital of which was Merv, in modern-day southeastern Turkmenistan. Sarianidi's excavations from the late 1970s onward revealed numerous monumental structures in many sites, fortified by impressive walls and gates. Reports on the BMAC were mostly confined to Soviet journals,See Sarianidi, V. I. 1976. \\"Issledovanija pamjatnikov Dashlyiskogo Oazisa,\\" in Drevnii Baktria, vol. 1.

Development =Early Food Producing Era= There is archaeological evidence of settlement in the well-watered northern foothills of the Kopet Dag during the Neolithic period, in this region, at Jeitun (or Djeitun), mud brick houses were first occupied during Early Food Producing Era, also known as Jeitun Neolithic from c. 7200 to 4600 BC.Vidale, Massimo, (2017). Treasures from the Oxus, p. 9, Table 1. The inhabitants were farmers who kept herds of goats and sheep and grew wheat and barley, with origins in southwest Asia. Jeitun has given its name to the whole Neolithic period in the northern foothills of the Kopet Dag. At the late Neolithic site of Chagylly Depe, farmers increasingly grew the kinds of crops that are typically associated with irrigation in an arid environment, such as hexaploid bread wheat, which became predominant during the Chalcolithic period. This region is dotted with the multi-period hallmarks characteristic of the ancient Near East, similar to those southwest of the Kopet Dag in the Gorgan Plain in Iran. Female statuette, an example of a \\"Bactrian princess\\"; late 3rd‚Äìearly 2nd millennium BC; steatite or chlorite and alabaster; 9 √ó 9.4 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) =Regionalization Era= Regionalization Era begins in Anau IA with a pre-Chalcolithic phase also in Kopet Dag piedmont region from 4600 to 4000 BC, then Chalcolithic period develops from 4000 to 2800 BC in Namazga I-III, Ilgynly Depe, and Altyn Depe. During this Copper Age, the population of the region grew. Archaeologist Vadim Mikhaƒ≠lovich Masson, who led the South Turkmenistan Complex Archaeological Expedition from 1946, sees signs that people migrated to the region from central Iran at this time, bringing metallurgy and other innovations, but thinks that the newcomers soon blended with the Jeitun farmers. (Vadim was the son of archaeologist Mikhail Masson, who already started work in this same area previously.) By contrast a re- excavation of Monjukli Depe in 2010 found a distinct break in settlement history between the late neolithic and early chalcolithic eras there.Reinhard Bernbeck et al., \\"A-II Spatial Effects of Technological Innovations and Changing Ways of Life,\\" in Friederike Fless, Gerd Gra√ühoff, Michael Meyer (eds.), Reports of the Research Groups at the Topoi Plenary Session 2010, eTopoi: Journal for Ancient Studies, Special Volume 1 (2011).Monjukli Depe artefacts (in German). Altyn-Depe location on the modern Middle East map as well as location of other Eneolithic cultures (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro). Major chalcolithic settlements sprang up at Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe. In addition, there were smaller settlements at Anau, Dashlyji, and Yassy-depe. Settlements similar to the early level at Anau also appeared further east‚Äì in the ancient delta of the river Tedzen, the site of the Geoksiur Oasis. About 3500 BC, the cultural unity of the area split into two pottery styles: colourful in the west (Anau, Kara-Depe and Namazga-Depe) and more austere in the east at Altyn-Depe and the Geoksiur Oasis settlements. This may reflect the formation of two tribal groups. It seems that around 3000 BC, people from Geoksiur migrated into the Murghab delta (where small, scattered settlements appeared) and reached further east into the Zerafshan Valley in Transoxiana. In both areas pottery typical of Geoksiur was in use. In Transoxiana they settled at Sarazm near Pendjikent. To the south the foundation layers of Shahr-i Sh≈çkhta on the bank of the Helmand river in south-eastern Iran contained pottery of the Altyn-Depe and Geoksiur type. Thus the farmers of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan were connected by a scattering of farming settlements. =Late Regionalization Era= In the Early Bronze Age, at the end of Late Regionalization Era (2800 to 2400 BC), the culture of the Kopet Dag oases and Altyn-Depe developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at Namazga-Depe. Altyn-Depe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown. =Integration Era= The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age also known as Integration Era, corresponding to Namazga-Depe level V (c. 2400-2000 BC). Namazga Depe reaching c. 52 hectares and holding maybe 17‚Äì20,000 inhabitants, and Altyn Depe with its maximum size of c. 25 hectares and 7-10,000 inhabitants, were the two big cities in Kopet Dag piedmont.Vidale, Massimo, (2017). Treasures from the Oxus, pp. 10, 18. It is this Bronze Age culture which has been given the BMAC name. Gonur Depe is the largest of all settlements in this period and is located at the delta of Murghab river in southern Turkmenistan (Margiana region) with an area of around 55 hectares. An almost elliptical fortified complex, known as Gonur North includes the so- called \\"Monumental Palace\\", other minor buildings, temples and ritual places, together with the \\"Royal Necropolis\\", and water reservoirs, all dating from around 2400 to 1900 BC.Frenez, Dennys, (2018). \\"Manufacturing and trade of Asian elephant ivory in Bronze Age Middle Asia: Evidence from Gonur Depe (Margiana, Turkmenistan)\\" in Archaeological Research in Asia 15, p. 15. In Bactria, Northern Afghanistan, the site Dashly 3 is regarded to be also from Middle Bronze Age period to Late Bronze Age (2300-1700 BCE), the old Dashly 3 complex, sometimes identified as a palace, is a fortified rectangular 88 m x 84 m compound. The square building had massive double outer walls and in the middle of each wall was a protruding salient composed of a T-shaped corridor flanked by two L-shaped corridors.K.E. Eduljee, \\"Dashly\\",(2005). Material culture Bird-headed man with snakes; 2000-1500 BC; bronze; 7.30 cm; from Northern Afghanistan; Los Angeles County Museum of Art (USA) =Agriculture and economy= The inhabitants of the BMAC were sedentary people who practised irrigation farming of wheat and barley. With their impressive material culture including monumental architecture, bronze tools, ceramics, and jewellery of semiprecious stones, the complex exhibits many of the hallmarks of civilisation. The complex can be compared to proto-urban settlements in the Helmand basin at Mundigak in western Afghanistan and Shahr-e Sukhteh in eastern Iran, or at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley. Models of two-wheeled carts from c. 3000 BC found at Altyn-Depe are the earliest evidence of wheeled transport in Central Asia, though model wheels have come from contexts possibly somewhat earlier. Judging by the type of harness, carts were initially pulled by oxen, or a bull. However camels were domesticated within the BMAC.

The palace of north Gonur measures 150 metres by 140 metres, the temple at Togolok 140 metres by 100 metres, the fort at Kelleli 3 125 metres by 125 metres, and the house of a local ruler at Adji Kui 25 metres by 25 metres. Each of these formidable structures has been extensively excavated. While they all have impressive fortification walls, gates, and buttresses, it is not always clear why one structure is identified as a temple and another as a palace. Mallory points out that the BMAC fortified settlements such as Gonur and Togolok resemble the qila, the type of fort known in this region in the historical period. They may be circular or rectangular and have up to three encircling walls. Within the forts are residential quarters, workshops and temples. The people of the BMAC culture were very proficient at working in a variety of metals including bronze, copper, silver, and gold. This is attested through the many metal artefacts found throughout the sites. Extensive irrigation systems have been discovered at the Geoksiur Oasis. =Writing= The discovery of a single tiny stone seal (known as the \\"Anau seal\\") with geometric markings from the BMAC site at Anau in Turkmenistan in 2000 led some to claim that the Bactria-Margiana complex had also developed writing, and thus may indeed be considered a literate civilisation. It bears five markings which are similar to Chinese \\"small seal\\" characters. The only match to the Anau seal is a small jet seal of almost identical shape from Niy√§ (near modern Minfeng) along the southern Silk Road in Xinjiang, originally thought to be from the Western Han dynasty but now thought to date to 700 BC. Interactions with other cultures BMAC materials have been found in the Indus Valley Civilisation, on the Iranian Plateau, and in the Persian Gulf. Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a Harappan seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe. The relationship between Altyn- Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two Harappan seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of Shortugai in Northern Afghanistan on the banks of the Amu Darya probably served as a trading station. There is evidence of sustained contact between the BMAC and the Eurasian steppes to the north, intensifying c. 2000 BC. In the delta of the Amu Darya where it reaches the Aral Sea, its waters were channelled for irrigation agriculture by people whose remains resemble those of the nomads of the Andronovo culture. This is interpreted as nomads settling down to agriculture, after contact with the BMAC, known as the Tazabagyab culture. About 1900 BC, the walled BMAC centres decreased sharply in size. Each oasis developed its own types of pottery and other objects. Also pottery of the Tazabagyab-Andronovo culture to the north appeared widely in the Bactrian and Margian countryside. Many BMAC strongholds continued to be occupied and Tazabagyab-Andronovo coarse incised pottery occurs within them (along with the previous BMAC pottery) as well as in pastoral camps outside the mudbrick walls. In the highlands above the Bactrian oases in Tajikistan, kurgan cemeteries of the Vaksh and Bishkent type appeared with pottery that mixed elements of the late BMAC and Tazabagyab-Andronovo traditions.David Anthony, The Horse, the Wheel and Language (2007), pp.452‚Äì56. In southern Bactrian sites like Sappali Tepe too, increasing links with the Andronovo culture are seen. During the period 1700 - 1500 BCE, metal artifacts from Sappali Tepe derive from the Tazabagyab-Andronovo culture. Relationship with Indo-Iranians The Bactria‚ÄìMargiana complex has attracted attention as a candidate for those looking for the material counterparts to the Indo-Iranians (Aryans), a major linguistic branch that split off from the Proto-Indo- Europeans. Sarianidi himself advocates identifying the complex as Indo- Iranian, describing it as the result of a migration from southwestern Iran. Bactria‚ÄìMargiana material has been found at Susa, Shahdad, and Tepe Yahya in Iran, but Lamberg-Karlovsky does not see this as evidence that the complex originated in southeastern Iran. \\"The limited materials of this complex are intrusive in each of the sites on the Iranian Plateau as they are in sites of the Arabian peninsula.\\" A significant section of the archaeologists are more inclined to see the culture as begun by farmers in the Near Eastern Neolithic tradition, but infiltrated by Indo-Iranian speakers from the Andronovo culture in its late phase, creating a hybrid. In this perspective, Proto-Indo-Aryan developed within the composite culture before moving south into the Indian subcontinent. The Andronovo, BMAC and Yaz cultures have often been associated with Indo-Iranian migrations. As James P. Mallory phrased it: According to recent studies BMAC was not a primary contributor to later South-Asian genetics. = Possible evidence for a BMAC substratum in Indo-Iranian = As argued by Michael Witzel and Alexander Lubotsky, there is a proposed substratum in Proto-Indo-Iranian which can be plausibly identified with the original language of the BMAC. Moreover, Lubotsky points out a larger number of words apparently borrowed from the same language, which are only attested in Indo-Aryan and therefore evidence of a substratum in Vedic Sanskrit. He explains this by proposing that Indo-Aryan speakers probably formed the vanguard of the movement into south-central Asia and many of the BMAC loanwords which entered Iranian may have been mediated through Indo-Aryan. Michael Witzel points out that the borrowed vocabulary includes words from agriculture, village and town life, flora and fauna, ritual and religion, so providing evidence for the acculturation of Indo-Iranian speakers into the world of urban civilisation.  Genetics  In 2018, Narasimhan and co-authors analyzed BMAC skeletons from the Bronze Age sites of Bustan, Dzharkutan, Gonur Tepe, and Sapalli Tepe. The male specimens belonged to haplogroup E1b1a (1/18), E1b1b (1/18), G (2/18), J* (2/18), J1 (1/18), J2 (4/18), L (2/18), R* (1/18), R1b (1/18), R2 (2/18), and T (1/18). A follow-up study by Narasimhan and co-authors (2019) suggested the primary BMAC population largely derived from preceding local Copper Age peoples who were in turn related to prehistoric farmers from the Iranian plateau and to a lesser extent early Anatolian farmers and hunter-gatherers from Western Siberia, and they did not contribute substantially to later populations further south in the Indus Valley. They found no evidence that the samples extracted from the BMAC sites derived any part of their ancestry from Yamnaya culture people, who are seen as Proto-Indo-Europeans in the Kurgan hypothesis, the most influential theory on the Proto-Indo-European homeland.

This term is used most often in reference to the preparation of insects, such as crickets and mealworms, or mice which are used as food for reptile pets. Insects that are raised commercially for the pet trade are themselves of little nutritional value. By providing the prey animals with a high quality diet prior to feeding, they become a more nutritious meal for the predator.Merck Veterinary Manual. www.merckvetmanual.com Gut loading can be accomplished by providing fruits, vegetables, and cereals or a nutritionally complete manufactured diet. Several commercial products are available and are fortified specifically for gut loading. These products often include varying combinations of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber. Importance Gut loading is considered most important if the primary source of nutrition is from insects. This is due to the fact that commercially raised insects are very nutrient poor compared to wild counterparts. This is especially true of vitamin A, among many other nutrients. Gut loading is considered less important when animals such as mice are used as prey. This is because of the large amount of digestible energy and other nutrients a mammal contains in its tissues. It is also a less common practice when rodents are fed, because it is usually preferred to feed pre-killed prey from the store to protect the predator from being bitten. Methods Gut loading is designed to increase the nutrition of the prey's body and to fill the digestive tract of the prey with nutrients. As the term suggests, gut loading is usually looked upon as a way to get essential nutrients into a reptile via the ingestion of the digestive tract of the prey. The two methods of nutrient uptake are important due to the ability of the prey to process nutrients into a digestible form for the predator. For example, most prey can digest complex carbohydrates into other forms of nutritional energy which the predator can use. However, gut loading nutrients like calcium do not have to be digested by their prey before its death in order to be available to the predator.

The hat is known in Ireland as a paddy cap, in Scotland as a bunnet, in Wales as a Dai cap, in New Zealand as a cheese-cutter, and in the United States as a driving cap. Cloths used to make the cap include wool, tweed (most common), and cotton. Less common materials may include leather, linen, or corduroy. The inside of the cap is commonly lined for comfort and warmth. History Woolen flat cap Flat cap, side view, herringbone pattern The style can be traced back to the 14th century in Northern England, when it was more likely to be called a \\"bonnet\\". This term was replaced by \\"cap\\" before about 1700, except in Scotland, where it continues to be referred to as a bunnet in Scots. A 1571 Act of the English Parliament was enacted to stimulate domestic wool consumption and general trade. It decreed that on Sundays and holidays, all males over 6 years of age, except for the nobility and \\"persons of degree\\", were to wear woolen caps or pay a fine of three farthings (0.75 penny, or about ¬£0.003) per day. The Act was not repealed until 1597, though by then the flat cap had become firmly entrenched as a recognised mark of a non-noble person, such as a burgher, a tradesman, or an apprentice. The style may have been the same as the Tudor bonnet still used in some styles of academic dress. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, when men predominantly wore some form of headgear, flat caps were commonly worn throughout Great Britain and Ireland. Versions in finer cloth were also considered to be suitable casual countryside wear for upper-class Englishmen. Flat caps were worn by fashionable young men in the 1920s. Boys of all classes in the United Kingdom wore flat caps during this period. In the United States, the caps were worn from the 1890s. The cap grew in popularity at the turn of the 20th century and was at the time standard boys' wear. They were worn to school, for casual wear, and with suits. Flat caps were almost always worn with knicker suits in the 1910s and 1920s. Both flat caps and knickerbockers declined in popularity during the 1930s. The flat cap made its way to southern Italy in the late 1800s, likely brought by British servicemen. In Turkey, the flat cap became the main headgear for men after it became a replacement for the fez, which was banned by Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk in 1925. Academic regalia One of the flat hats worn in academia is known as a bonnet or Tudor bonnet and derives directly from medieval headgear of the period of the original 1571 Act. It remains ceremonial wear by members of the academic community in many countries, usually as the headgear of doctoral graduates. Commonly, it has a soft, round crown and a stiff, flat brim. The bonnet is often made of black velvet and trimmed, between crown and brim, with gold cord and tassels. Some universities opt to trim their bonnets with coloured cord and tassels. Some stylistic varieties of this bonnet are: *The Canterbury cap is a flat-topped, soft cloth hat with a round headband deeper at the back than at the front. *The Oxford bonnet has a black ribbon between crown and brim. *The John Knox cap is a soft, square cap made from black velvet and worn by the doctors of certain Scottish universities, as well as Durham University in England, the University of Calgary, and Queens' University in Canada. It is also worn by the holders of higher doctorates of the University of Liverpool and Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. The academic cap (mortar board), however, is more widely used in academia. British popular culture In British popular culture, the flat cap (or \\"flat hat\\") is typically associated with older working-class men, especially those in Northern England,Katie Wales (2006). Northern English: a cultural and social history. p. 26. Cambridge University Press and the West Country, as personified by Fred Dibnah (Lancashire) and comic strip anti-hero Andy Capp (Teesside). The flat cap's strong connection with the working class and the East End of London is illustrated by Jim Branning of the television soap opera EastEnders and Del- Boy Trotter of Only Fools and Horses. Taxicab and bus drivers are often depicted wearing a flat cap, as comedically portrayed by Gareth Hale and Norman Pace's (Hale and Pace) \\"London cabbies\\" television sketches. In the BBC show Peaky Blinders, characters show their membership of the Birmingham gang by sewing razor blades into the peak of their flat caps, supposedly for use as a weapon.AC/DC vocalist Brian Johnson, a native of Newcastle, customarily wears a flat cap on stage and frequently off.Anthony Bozza (2009). Why AC/DC Matters. p.54. HarperCollins, Retrieved 30 November 2011 The flat cap can also be taken to denote the upper class when affecting casualness. \\"A toff can be a bit of a chap as well without, as it were, losing face.\\"Mather, Geoffrey. \\"Capped for England\\" BBC Radio 4, 2001. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, British public figures including David Beckham, Guy Ritchie, Richard Blackwood, and the Prince of Wales wore the flat cap. North American culture The flat cap hat is associated in North American (chiefly US) popular culture with city newsboys (i.e., street-corner newspaper sellers), the style sometimes being called a \\"newsboy\\" or newsboy cap, sometimes referred to as a \\"Kangol hat\\" due to conflation with the brand that makes certain styles of flat caps. It is also sometimes seen worn by older non- professional or amateur golfers. Current popularity Dick Berggren is known for wearing a flat cap. The style has remained popular among groups of people in the Great Britain, Ireland, and North America. The cap is sometimes associated with older men, significantly in South Korea, but has been popular (along with the newsboy cap) among some segments of younger people, for example, in cities such as Boston and Pittsburgh with a large Irish-American population. It has appeared in the hip hop subculture, sometimes worn back-to- front or cocked to the side. It is also very common among men and women in San Francisco, California. In Turkey, it is highly popular amongst men, mostly working-class. The English rugby league team Featherstone Rovers supporters' nickname is \\"the Flat Cappers\\", because supporters in years gone by attended matches wearing them as did most other teams' supporters. The black leather flat cap is often combined with a patched-up sport coat or leather jacket and dark clothes (sometimes combined with a bee-striped convict‚Äôs shirt) in popular culture to depict a burglar, mugger, or robber, occasionally with a domino mask. The comic book character the Goon is based on this archetype of the flat-capped street tough from vintage cartoons and comics. The Canadian team in the 1998 Winter Olympics wore red flat caps designed by Roots in the opening ceremony parade of nations. In addition, the US team in the 2008 Summer Olympics also wore white flat caps designed by Polo Ralph Lauren during the parade of nations. It is commonly worn within the gopnik subculture in Russia.

The USSOCOM version of the MK23 came paired with a laser aiming module (LAM) and suppressor. The USSOCOM MK23 was adopted by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for special operations units, beating out the nearest competitor, Colt's OHWS. Development of the pistol began in 1991 as special operations representatives identified the need for an \\"Offensive Handgun Weapons System‚ÄîSpecial Operations Peculiar\\", and delivery of the pistols began in May 1996 to the special operation units. While the USSOCOM MK23 designation usually applies to the complete system, it is also commonly used in reference to the pistol component alone. The LAM and suppressor were developed by Insight Technology and Knight's Armament Company (KAC), respectively. The civilian version of the Mk23 sold by itself is designated the Mark 23. Overview The MK 23 is considered a match grade pistol, and is capable of making a group at . The MK 23 is designed for exceptional durability in harsh environments, being waterproof and corrosion- resistant. It uses a polygonal barrel design, which is reported to improve accuracy and durability, and is much more expensive to produce. It also features an ambidextrous safety and magazine release on both sides of the frame. The magazine release is at the rear edge of the trigger guard, which is wide enough to allow the use of gloves. A decocking lever is on the left side, which will silently lower the cocked hammer. The MK 23 is part of a larger weapon system that includes an attachable Laser Aiming Module (LAM), a suppressor, and some other features such as a special high-pressure match cartridge (.45 +P ammunition). The firearm was tested and found to be capable of firing tens of thousands of rounds without a barrel change. It remains reliable in harsh conditions, making it suitable for use by special forces. The .45 ACP round has considerable stopping power and yet is subsonic, making it suitable for use with a suppressor. Development In 1989, US SOCOM began reviewing their equipment to see which gear fit the needs of their special close quarters battle role. Studying small arms revealed that there were 120 types and configurations of infantry weapons in different units. The logistics of getting spare parts for all these weapons was overwhelming. In response, SOCOM decided to standardize small arms among all units. One area of improvement was the pistol, undertaken by the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) competition. It would replace pistols like the 9 mm M9, which was used by regular troops as a secondary weapon. SOCOM's use of small units that operate in close means that pistols are more likely to be used as primary weapons.MK23 Mod 0: The Crew-Served Pistol - SAdefensejournal.com, 10 June 2013 The caliber for the OHWS was quickly decided not to be the NATO standard 9 mm due to lack of stopping power. The FBI had selected the 10 mm auto to replace their 9 mm pistols, but it was too powerful, few manufacturers produced it, and the round caused short weapon service life. The .45 ACP caliber was chosen and improved upon with the high velocity, high pressure +P loading. The OHWS pistol had to fire many types of rounds in addition to the +P cartridge and have a long service life with the high pressure ammo. The M1911 had been proven in service for over 70 years, but was rejected. High pressure rounds would destroy it and it did not fire reliably with a suppressor. Upgrading the M1911 would cost more than it was worth, so it was decided that they would select an entirely new design. A request for quote was for a system that included a pistol, suppressor, and laser aiming module. The pistol had to be corrosion resistant, have a high mean rounds between failures (MRBF), and be able to serve as a primary weapon. After several tests, Heckler & Koch and Colt submissions were selected to move to phase I of the OHWS program in August 1991. They were awarded developmental contracts to produce 30 systems. At the time the program was beginning, HK was studying what aspects were most desirable in handguns for the U.S. civilian market. They came up with a design that had these features including reliability, durability, affordability, and others by February 1991. Colt however essentially drew upon existing technologies for their submission called the Colt OHWS. They used an M1911 frame that could accept a 10-round magazine, the decocking mechanism from the Colt Double Eagle, and the rotating barrel locking system from the All American 2000. The barrel of the Colt OHWS could not directly attach a suppressor, so a mounting was added to a rail in front of the handguard. Colt was eliminated after phase I, leaving only HK to move on to phase II. This phase subjected the pistols to the strictest reliability testing any pistol ever went through. The requirement was for no less than 2,000 MRBF; the HK OHWS averaged 6,027 MRBF and could reach 15,122 MRBF. Three pistols went through a 30,000-round endurance test and maintained accuracy of at 25 meters; only the O-ring needed replacement after 20,000 rounds. The weapons worked in temperatures from -25 degrees Fahrenheit to 140 degrees Fahrenheit while exposed to mud, ice, and sand. Phase III was the awarding of a production contract to HK in June 1995. Their pistol was type classified as the Mark 23 Mod 0, and 1,950 systems were ordered at $1,186 each. All pistols were produced in Germany and the first was delivered to SOCOM on 1 May 1996. Even though the Mark 23 had performed admirably, several factors worked against its use. Previous operators were trained to fire multiple 9 mm rounds and they thought firing extra rounds made up for not using harder hitting but larger and heavier .45 ACP rounds. The introduction of the smaller and lighter HK USP, political pressures, and shortages of +P ammunition also contributed against the pistol. As the War on Terror went on, operators saw the effectiveness of the .45 ACP in combat and renewed use of the Mark 23, as well as other pistols chambered for the round. Adoption The MK 23 MOD 0 was built as an \\"offensive\\" handgun for U.S. special operations forces under USSOCOM, per request made in 1989. Military versions of the firearm have the writing \\"MK23 USSOCOM\\" engraved on the slide. The first MK 23 production models were delivered to SOCOM on May 1, 1996.Dockery, Kevin. Special Warfare Special Weapons: The Arms & Equipment of the UDT and SEALs from 1943 to the Present (Chicago: Emperor's Press), 51. HK commercially markets the MK 23 and derivatives of it, but not the complete SOCOM system. The suppressor is made by Knight's Armament Company, and was selected over the one HK originally included as part of its entry. Insight Technology won the contract to produce the laser aiming module, later designated AN/PEQ-6. One version of the LAM produces a visible light dot, while another produces an infrared dot that can only be seen through night vision goggles. There have since been different LAM models and, at least commercially, different suppressors as well. It has been reported by some users that the cumulative effects of recoil may occasionally cause the can of the suppressor to become slightly unscrewed, but that it is relatively easy to improvise solutions for the problem. =Civilian Mark 23= Heckler & Koch has offered the MK 23 on the civilian market and law enforcement as the MARK 23. It is distributed by its subsidiaries HK Inc. (United States) and HKJS GmbH (Germany). The models for the U.S. market initially came with a 10-round magazine, to comply with the U.S. Assault Weapons Ban. The ban has now expired, and the civilian Mark 23 comes with the same 12-round magazine as the government variants, except in a few states that enforce their own bans on magazines larger than 10 rounds. In Canada, the Mark 23 pistol is still supplied only with 10-round magazines, as per the 1995 Firearms Act. According to the Operators Manual,MK 23 Operators Manual there are few differences between the civilian Mark 23 and the government MK 23. These differences are the slide engraving \\"Mark 23\\" which is only for the first half of the first year of production in 1996 (KG date code), the roll- mark \\"MARK 23\\" which is for mid 1996 to now, these instead of \\"MK23 USSOCOM\\", Matte vs shiny finish for different civilian years, tan vs black frame (500 tan ones were made), and a barrel conforming to SAAMI headspace specifications for the military vs civilian made, as the military barrels were made to allow ball ammunition to work more reliably. Alternatives In spite of its positive points, the MK 23's large size and weight have resulted in some criticism. The handgun was designed for offense rather than defense, the size and weight intentionally incorporated to help absorb recoil forces and retain greater accuracy; but this also decreased its ease of use, comfort, and draw speed in defensive situations which require a more conventional, compact pistol. In response, HK developed the USP Tactical pistol based on the original USP; USP Tactical and MK 23 look similar indeed being a different pistols by design and purpose, the Tactical retains much of the performance of the MK 23 without the bulky size. It uses a different suppressor (due to 16 X 1mm left handed threading, as opposed to 16 X 1mm right-handed on the MK 23). An even more compact pistol than the USP Tactical for counter-terrorist and special forces use is the HK USP Compact Tactical, which has its own optional LAM. The USP-CT is lighter and is capable of fitting a suppressor, making it a prime choice for Special Forces on covert operations.

Bush until August 2003.  Early life and education  Thompson, the son of a railroad laborer, was born and raised in Hannibal, Missouri. He received his bachelor's degree, graduating cum laude, from Culver-Stockton College in 1967, his master's degree from Michigan State University in 1969, and his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Michigan in 1974. In 1970, Thompson married Brenda Anne Taggart. They have two sons.  Corporate career  Thompson worked as an industrial relations representative for Ford Motor Company during law school. After graduation he worked as an attorney for Monsanto Company in St. Louis until 1977. That year he joined the law firm of King & Spalding in Atlanta, Georgia. He left the firm in 1982 for four years as U.S. attorney for the northern District of Georgia; however, he returned and was made a partner in 1986.

It is situated on the Gulf of California, near the mouth of the Mayo River. It is located at latitude . Huatabampo is 34 km southwest of Navojoa via Sonora State Highway 56 and Sonora State Highway 149. Mexican Federal Highway 15 can be accessed via Sonora State Highway 176. It is notable as the home of revolutionary general √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, a successful chickpea farmer before the Mexican Revolution, and now his burial site. Etymology The name Huatabampo is from the local Mayo language, \\"Huata\\" (Willow) + \\"Bampo\\" (Water), or \\"Willow in/near the Water\\". Huatabampo is also known as \\"Tierra de Generales\\" (Land of Generals) since during the Mexican Revolution (1910‚Äì1917) several high-ranking revolutionary generals emerged from this town. Among them, √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n (1880‚Äì1928), who was born in Navojoa, but lived for many years in Huatabampo, the only undefeated general in the war. He was elected President of the Mexican Republic (1920‚Äì1924) after the war, being an important link between the war-devastated country and the first stages of political, economical and social development. He was assassinated in 1928 after elected to a second term and before he took office. He is buried in the old local cemetery. Other generals from the area were General Jos√© Tiburcio Otero Toledo (1834‚Äì1900), a famous military and a governor of Sonora, and General Ignacio Otero Pablos (1896‚Äì1970), who was Ambassador to the Dominican Republic and Venezuela and also a candidate for governor of Sonora. Demographics The population was 74,533 in 2005, with 29,789 inhabitants living in the municipal seat. Other towns are Ejido la Uni√≥n, Yavaros, Sahuaral de Otero, Etchoropo, Huatabampito, Moroncarit, Agiabampo, Estaci√≥n Luis, Las Bocas, El Caro, Citavaro, Pozo Dulce, and El J√∫pare. As of 2005 the per capita income for the municipality of Huatabampo was $5,984 and the Human Development Index was 0.8002. Economy Huatabampo is a major agricultural producer for the area, its produce includes chickpeas as well as assorted fruit, vegetable and cereal crops. Cattle and swine raising is also very important. Since Huatabampo has 120 km of coastline, fishing plays a major role in the economy. There are over 3,000 registered fishermen and around 20 open sea trawlers, in addition to almost one thousand small boats. Shrimp raising has also become a major industry in recent years. In 2000 there were 8 industries for industrialization of sardines, crab, and shrimp. The production of fish oil and fish flour is also important. Tourism The city attracts a considerable number of tourists, primarily from the United States, due to its beaches and spas.

It has the same overall shape and stiff peak (visor) in front as a flat cap, but the body of the cap is rounder, fuller, and paneled with a button on top, and often with a button attaching the front to the brim (as the flat cap sometimes has). History The style was popular in Europe and North America in the early 20th centuries among both boys and adult men. As the name suggests, it was at the time associated with newspaper boys. This gives rise to a misunderstanding. It is true that many newspaper boys and other working boys at the time wore flat caps along with other styles. This style was not, however, worn only by boys. Flat caps were very common for North American and European men and boys of all classes during the early 20th century and were almost universal during the 1910s-20s, particularly among the working 'lower' classes. A great many photographs of the period show these caps worn not only by newsboys, but by dockworkers, high steel workers, shipwrights, costermongers, farmers, beggars, bandits, artisans, and tradesmen of many types. This is also well attested in novels and films of this period and just after. 8 piece style caps are essentially an offshoot of a scottish tam o' shanter. While they were worn by boys and men of all social classes, they were worn by the 'upper' classes primarily for leisure activities, and the style became associated with well-to-do country sportsmen, drivers and wealthy golfers.

For at least 2,500 years,UNESCO, Caravanserais along the Grand Trunk Road in Pakistan it has linked Central Asia to the Indian subcontinent. It runs roughly, GlobalSecurity.org: Grand Trunk Road from Teknaf, Bangladesh west to Kabul, Afghanistan, passing through Chittagong and Dhaka in Bangladesh, Kolkata, Allahabad (Prayagraj), Delhi, and Amritsar in India, and Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar in Pakistan. Chandragupta Maurya of the Mauryan Empire in ancient India, built his highway along this ancient route called Uttarapatha in the 3rd century BC, extending it from the mouth of the Ganges to the north-western frontier of the Empire. Further improvements to this road were made under Ashoka. It was rebuilt many times under Sher Shah Suri, the Mughals and the British along a partly similar route.Romila Thapar, p. 236, Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300 The old route was re-aligned by Suri to Sonargaon and Rohtas.Vadime Elisseeff, p. 159-162, The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and CommerceFarooqui Salma Ahmed, p. 234, A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: From Twelfth to the Mid- Eighteenth Century The Afghan end of the road was rebuilt under Mahmud Shah Durrani. The road was considerably rebuilt in the British period between 1833 and 1860.David Arnold (historian); Science, technology, and medicine in colonial India (New Cambr hist India v.III.5) Cambridge University Press, 2000, 234 pages p. 106 The road coincides with current N1, Feni,(Chittagong to Dhaka), N4 & N405 (Dhaka to Sirajganj), N507 (Sirajganj to Natore) and N6 (Natore to Rajshai towards Purnea in India) in Bangladesh; NH 12 (Purnea to Bakkhali ), NH 27 (Purnea to Patna), NH 19 (Kolkata to Agra), NH 44 (Agra to Jalandhar via New Delhi, Sonipat, Panipat, Ambala and Ludhiana) and NH 3 (Jalandhar to Attari, Amritsar in India towards Lahore in Pakistan) via Wagah; N-5 (Lahore, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Lalamusa, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Khyber Pass towards Jalalabad in Afghanistan) in Pakistan and AH1 (Torkham- Jalalabad to Kabul) in Afghanistan. Over the centuries, the road acted as one of the major trade routes in the region and facilitated both travel and postal communication. The Grand Trunk Road is still used for transportation in present-day Indian subcontinent, where parts of the road have been widened and included in the national highway system.  History  = Ancient times = The Buddhist literature and Indian epics such as Mahabharata provide the existence of Grand Trunk road even before the Mauryan empire and was called Uttarpatha or the \\"Northern road\\". The road connected the eastern region of India with central Asia or Bactria. = Mauryan Empire = The precursor of the modern Grand Trunk road was built by the emperor Chandragupta Maurya and was based on the highway running from Susa to Sardis.Benjamin Walker, p. 69, Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism. In Two Volumes. Volume II M-Z During the time of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BCE, overland trade between India and several parts of Western Asia and Bactria world went through the cities of the north-west, primarily Takshashila and Purushapura modern-day Peshawar (in present-day in Pakistan). Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to Patliputra (present-day Patna in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat Megasthenes who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of Purushapura, Takshashila, Hastinapura, Kanyakubja, Prayag, Patliputra and Tamralipta, a distance of around . The route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \\"Uttarapatha\\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by PƒÅ·πáini. The emperor Ashoka had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half kos and many \\"nimisdhayas\\", which is often translated as rest-houses along the route. The emperor Kanishka is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha. = Sur and Mughal Empires = Sher Shah Suri, the medieval ruler of the Sur Empire, took to rebuilding Chandragupta's Royal Road in the 16th century., The old route was further rerouted at Sonargaon and Rohtas and its breadth increased. Fruit trees and shade trees were planted. At every 2 kos, a sarai was built, the number of kos minars and baolis increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son Islam Shah Suri constructed an additional sarai in- between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah Suri on the road toward Bengal. More sarais were built under the Mughals. Jahangir under his reign issued a decree that all sarais be built of burnt brick and stone. Broad- leaved trees were planted in the stretch between Lahore and Agra and he built bridges overall water bodies that were situated on the path of the highways. The route was referred to as \\"Sadak-e-Azam\\" by Suri, and \\"Badshahi Sadak\\" during Mughals.Anu Kapur, p. 84, Mapping Place Names of India = British Empire = A scene from the Ambala cantonment during the British India. In the 1830s the East India Company started a program of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes. The road, now named Grand trunk road, from Calcutta, through Delhi, to Kabul, Afghanistan was rebuilt at a cost of ¬£1000/mile. A Public Works Department along with a training institute (the erstwhile Thomason College of Civil Engineering) which is now known as the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee was founded, to train and employ local surveyors, engineers, and overseers, to perform the work, and in future maintain it and other roads. The road is mentioned in a number of literary works including those of Foster and Rudyard Kipling. Kipling described the road as: \\"Look! Look again! and chumars, bankers and tinkers, barbers and bunnias, pilgrims ‚Äì and potters ‚Äì all the world going and coming. It is to me as a river from which I am withdrawn like a log after a flood. And truly the Grand Trunk Road is a wonderful spectacle. It runs straight, bearing without crowding India's traffic for fifteen hundred miles ‚Äì such a river of life as nowhere else exists in the world.\\"A description of the road by Kipling, found both in his letters and in the novel Kim. = Republic of India = The ensemble of historic sites along the road in India was submitted to the tentative list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2015, under the title \\"Sites along the Uttarapath, Badshahi Sadak, Sadak-e-Azam, Grand Trunk Road\\".

The African grey hornbill has escaped or been deliberately released in to Florida, USA, but there is no evidence that the population is breeding and may only persist due to continuing releases or escapes. This bird prefers open woodland and savannah. The female lays two to four white eggs in a tree hollow, which is blocked off during incubation with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks. When the chicks and female outgrow the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall, after which both parents feed the chicks. At in length, this is a large bird, although it is one of the smaller hornbills. It has mainly grey plumage, but the head, flight feathers and long tail are a darker shade. There is a white line down each side of the head and one on the back which is visible only in flight. The long curved bill is black and has a small casque and a creamy horizontal stripe. The male has a black bill, whereas the female has red on the mandibles. The plumage of the male and female is similar. Immature birds are more uniformly grey. The flight is undulating. The similarly sized red- billed hornbill has uniformly grey plumage. The African grey hornbill is omnivorous, taking insects, fruit and reptiles. It feeds mainly in trees.

Formally, a mortgage lender (mortgagee), or other lienholder, obtains a termination of a mortgage borrower (mortgagor)'s equitable right of redemption, either by court order or by operation of law (after following a specific statutory procedure). Usually a lender obtains a security interest from a borrower who mortgages or pledges an asset like a house to secure the loan. If the borrower defaults and the lender tries to repossess the property, courts of equity can grant the borrower the equitable right of redemption if the borrower repays the debt. While this equitable right exists, it is a cloud on title and the lender cannot be sure that they can repossess the property.BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation, . Therefore, through the process of foreclosure, the lender seeks to immediately terminate the equitable right of redemption and take both legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple.Terrell v. Allison, 88 U.S. (21 Wall.) 289 (1875). Other lien holders can also foreclose the owner's right of redemption for other debts, such as for overdue taxes, unpaid contractors' bills or overdue homeowner association dues or assessments. The foreclosure process as applied to residential mortgage loans is a bank or other secured creditor selling or repossessing a parcel of real property after the owner has failed to comply with an agreement between the lender and borrower called a \\"mortgage\\" or \\"deed of trust\\". Commonly, the violation of the mortgage is a default in payment of a promissory note, secured by a lien on the property. When the process is complete, the lender can sell the property and keep the proceeds to pay off its mortgage and any legal costs, and it is typically said that \\"the lender has foreclosed its mortgage or lien\\". If the promissory note was made with a recourse clause and if the sale does not bring enough to pay the existing balance of principal and fees, then the mortgagee can file a claim for a deficiency judgment. In many states in the United States, items included to calculate the amount of a deficiency judgment include the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale. Types The mortgage holder can usually initiate foreclosure at a time specified in the mortgage documents, typically some period of time after a default condition occurs. In the United States, Canada and many other countries, several types of foreclosure exist. In the US for example, two of themnamely, by judicial sale and by power of saleare widely used, but other modes are possible in a few other U.S. states. =Judicial= Foreclosure by judicial sale, commonly called judicial foreclosure, involves the sale of the mortgaged property under the supervision of a court. The proceeds go first to satisfy the mortgage, then other lien holders, and finally the mortgagor/borrower if any proceeds are left. Judicial foreclosure is available in every US state and required in many (Florida requires judicial foreclosure). The lender initiates judicial foreclosure by filing a lawsuit against the borrower. As with all other legal actions, all parties must be notified of the foreclosure, but notification requirements vary significantly from state to state in the US. A judicial decision is announced after the exchange of pleadings at a (usually short) hearing in a state or local court in the US. In some rather rare instances, foreclosures are filed in US federal courts. A judicial officer supervises the sale and executes the legal papers and deed if any. This may be done by a superior court judge or a referee specially appointed by a court of judicial privacy. =Nonjudicial= Foreclosure by power of sale, also called nonjudicial foreclosure, and is authorized by many states if a power of sale clause is included in the mortgage or if a deed of trust with such a clause was used, instead of an actual mortgage. In some US states, like California and Texas, nearly all so- called mortgages are actually deeds of trust. This process involves the sale of the property by the mortgage holder without court supervision (as elaborated upon below). This process is generally much faster and cheaper than foreclosure by judicial sale. As in judicial sale, the mortgage holder and other lien holders are respectively first and second claimants to the proceeds from the sale. =Strict= Other types of foreclosure are considered minor because of their limited availability. Under strict foreclosure, which is available in a few states including Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont, if the mortgagee wins the court case, the court orders the defaulted mortgagor to pay the mortgage within a specified period of time. Should the mortgagor fail to do so, the mortgage holder gains the title to the property with no obligation to sell it. This type of foreclosure is generally available only when the value of the property is less than the debt (\\"under water\\"). Historically, strict foreclosure was the original method of foreclosure. Acceleration Acceleration is a clause that is usually found in Sections 16, 17, or 18 of a typical mortgage in the US. Not all accelerations are the same for each mortgage, as it depends on the terms and conditions between lender and obligated mortgagor(s). When a term in the mortgage has been broken, the acceleration clause goes into effect. It can declare the entire payable debt to the lender if the borrower(s) were to transfer the title at a future date to a purchaser. The clause in the mortgage also instructs that a notice of acceleration must be served to the obligated mortgagor(s) who signed the Note. Each mortgage gives a time period for the debtor(s) to cure their loan. The most common time periods allot to debtor(s) is usually 30 days, but for commercial property it can be 10 days. The notice of acceleration is called a Demand and/or Breach Letter. In the letter it informs the Borrower(s) that they have 10 or 30 days from the date on the letter to reinstate their loan. Demand/Breach letters are sent out by Certified and Regular mail to all notable addresses of the Borrower(s). Also in the acceleration of the mortgage the lender must provide a payoff quote that is estimated 30 days from the date of the letter. This letter is called an FDCPA (Fair Debt Collections Practices Acts) letter and/or Initial Communication Letter. Once the Borrower(s) receives the two letters providing a time period to reinstate or pay off their loan the lender must wait until that time expires in to take further action. When the 10 or 30 days have passed that means that the acceleration has expired and the Lender can move forward with foreclosing on the property. The lender will also include any unpaid property taxes and delinquent payments in this amount, so if the borrower does not have significant equity they will owe more than the original amount of the mortgage. Lenders may also accelerate a loan if there is a transfer clause, obligating the mortgagor to notify the lender of any transfer, whether; a lease-option, lease-hold of 3 years or more, land contracts, agreement for deed, transfer of title or interest in the property. The vast majority (but not all) of mortgages today have acceleration clauses. The holder of a mortgage without this clause has only two options: either to wait until all of the payments come due or convince a court to compel a sale of some parts of the property in lieu of the past due payments. Alternatively, the court may order the property sold subject to the mortgage, with the proceeds from the sale going to the payments owed the mortgage holder. Process The process of foreclosure can be rapid or lengthy and varies from state to state. Other options such as refinancing, a short sale, alternate financing, temporary arrangements with the lender, or even bankruptcy may present homeowners with ways to avoid foreclosure. Websites which can connect individual borrowers and homeowners to lenders are increasingly offered as mechanisms to bypass traditional lenders while meeting payment obligations for mortgage providers. Although there are slight differences between the states, the foreclosure process generally follows a timeline beginning with initial missed payments, moving to a sale being scheduled and finally a redemption period (if available). =Strict and judicial= In the United States, there are two types of foreclosure in most states described by common law. Using a \\"deed in lieu of foreclosure,\\" or \\"strict foreclosure\\", the noteholder claims the title and possession of the property back in full satisfaction of a debt, usually on contract. In the proceeding simply known as foreclosure (or, perhaps, distinguished as \\"judicial foreclosure\\"), the lender must sue the defaulting borrower in state court. Upon final judgment (usually summary judgment) in the lender's favor, the property is subject to auction by the county sheriff or some other officer of the court. Many states require this sort of proceeding in some or all cases of foreclosure to protect any equity the debtor may have in the property, in case the value of the debt being foreclosed on is substantially less than the market value of the real property; this also discourages a strategic foreclosure by a lender who wants to obtain the property. In this foreclosure, the sheriff then issues a deed to the winning bidder at auction. Banks and other institutional lenders may bid in the amount of the owed debt at the sale but there are a number of other factors that may influence the bid, and if no other buyers step forward the lender receives title to the real property in return. =Nonjudicial= Historically, the vast majority of judicial foreclosures have been unopposed, since most defaulting borrowers have no money to hire counsel. Therefore, the U.S. financial services industry has lobbied since the mid-19th century for faster foreclosure procedures that would not clog up state courts with uncontested cases, and would lower the cost of credit (because it must always have the cost of recovering collateral built-in). Lenders have also argued that taking foreclosures out of the courts is actually kinder and less traumatic to defaulting borrowers, as it avoids the in terrorem effects of being sued. In response, a slight majority of U.S. states have adopted nonjudicial foreclosure procedures in which the mortgagee (or more commonly the mortgagee's servicer's attorney, designated agent, or trustee) gives the debtor a notice of default (NOD) and the mortgagee's intent to sell the real property in a form prescribed by state statute; the NOD in some states must also be recorded against the property. This type of foreclosure is commonly called \\"statutory\\" or \\"nonjudicial\\" foreclosure, as opposed to \\"judicial\\", because the mortgagee does not need to file an actual lawsuit to initiate the foreclosure. A few states impose additional procedural requirements such as having documents stamped by a court clerk; Colorado requires the use of a county \\"public trustee,\\" a government official, rather than a private trustee specializing in carrying out foreclosures. However, in most states, the only government official involved in a nonjudicial foreclosure is the county recorder, who merely records any pre-sale notices and the trustee's deed upon sale. In this \\"power-of-sale\\" type of foreclosure, if the debtor fails to cure the default, or use other lawful means (such as filing for bankruptcy to temporarily stay the foreclosure) to stop the sale, the mortgagee or its representative conduct a public auction in a manner similar to the sheriff's auction. Notably, the lender itself can bid for the property at the auction, and is the only bidder that can make a \\"credit bid\\" (a bid based on the outstanding debt itself) while all other bidders must be able to immediately (or within a very short period of time) present the auctioneer with cash or a cash equivalent like a cashier's check. In May 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court, resolved uncertainty surrounding a secured creditor's right to credit bid in a sale under a Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan. In RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S.  (2012), the Court found it was obligated to interpret the bankruptcy code ‚Äúclearly and predictably using well established principles of statutory construction‚Äù resolving the lingering uncertainties of credit bidding under a chapter 11 plan and upholding secured creditors‚Äô rights. The highest bidder at the auction becomes the owner of the real property, free and clear of interest of the former owner, but possibly encumbered by liens superior to the foreclosed mortgage (e.g., a senior mortgage, unpaid property taxes, weed/demolition liens). Further legal action, such as an eviction, may be necessary to obtain possession of the premises if the former occupant fails to voluntarily vacate. =Defenses= In some US states, particularly those where only judicial foreclosure is available, the constitutional issue of due process has affected the ability of some lenders to foreclose. In Ohio, the US federal district court for the Northern District of Ohio has dismissed numerous foreclosure actions by lenders because of the inability of the alleged lender to prove that they are the real party in interest.JUDGE CHRISTOPHER A. BOYKO, ‚ÄúUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OHIO (EASTERN DIVISION)‚Äù, filed 10-31-2007 Retrieved July 12, 2008 The same happened in a Colorado district court case in June 2008.Block Colorado Foreclosure Blog www.blockcoloradoforeclosure.com In contrast, in six federal judicial circuits and the majority of nonjudicial foreclosure states (like California), due process has already been judicially determined to be a frivolous defense.Apao v. Bank of New York, 324 F.3d 1091 (9th Cir. 2003). The entire point of nonjudicial foreclosure is that there is no state actor (i.e., a court) involved.Garfinkle v. Superior Court, 21 Cal. 3d 268 (1978). This was a decision of the Supreme Court of California in favor of Wells Fargo. The constitutional right of due process protects people only from violations of their civil rights by state actors, not private actors. (The involvement of the county clerk or recorder in recording the necessary documents has been held to be insufficient to invoke due process, since they are required by statute to record all documents presented that meet minimum formatting requirements and are denied the discretion to decide whether a particular foreclosure should proceed.) A further rationale is that under the principle of freedom of contract, if debtors wish to enjoy the additional protection of the formalities of judicial foreclosure, it is their burden to find a lender willing to provide a loan secured by a traditional conventional mortgage instead of a deed of trust with a power of sale. Courts have also rejected as frivolous the argument that the mere legislative act of authorizing or regulating the nonjudicial foreclosure process thereby transforms the process itself into state action. In turn, since there is no right to due process in nonjudicial foreclosure, it has been held that it is irrelevant whether the borrower had actual notice (i.e., subjective awareness) of the foreclosure, as long as the foreclosure trustee performed the tasks prescribed by statute in an attempt to give notice.I.E. Associates v. Safeco Title Ins. Co., 39 Cal. 3d 281 (1985). =Equitable foreclosure= \\"Strict foreclosure\\" available in some states is an equitable right of the foreclosure sale purchaser. The purchaser must petition a court for a decree that cancels any junior lien holder's rights to the senior debt. If the junior lien holder fails to object within the judicially established time frame, his lien is canceled and the purchaser's title is cleared. This effect is the same as the strict foreclosure that occurred in English common law of equity as a response to the development of the equity of redemption. =Title search and tax lien issues= In most jurisdictions, it is customary for the foreclosing lender to obtain a title search of the real property and to notify all other persons who may have liens on the property, whether by judgment, by contract, or by statute or other law, so that they may appear and assert their interest in the foreclosure litigation. This is accomplished through the filing of a lis pendens as part of the lawsuit and recordation of it in order to provide public notice of the pendency of the foreclosure action. In all U.S. jurisdictions, a lender who conducts a foreclosure sale of real property that has a federal tax lien must give 25 days notice of the sale to the Internal Revenue Service. Failure to give notice results in the lien remaining attached to the real property after the sale. Therefore, it is imperative the lender search local federal tax liens, so that if parties to the foreclosure have a federal tax lien filed against them, the proper notice to the IRS is given. A detailed explanation by the IRS of the federal tax lien process can be found.Notice of Federal Tax Lien ‚Äî Internal Revenue Service United States Department of the Treasury Retrieved 16 March 2008lawsuit and recordation of it in order to provide public notice of the pendency of the foreclosure action. In all U.S. jurisdictions a lender who conducts a foreclosure sale of real property which is the subject of a federal tax lien must give 25 days' notice of the sale to the Internal Revenue Service: failure to give notice to the IRS results in the lien remaining attached to the real property after the sale. Therefore, it is imperative the lender search local federal tax liens so if parties involved in the foreclosure have a federal tax lien filed against them, the proper notice to the IRS is given. A detailed explanation by the IRS of the federal tax lien process can be found Contesting a foreclosure Because the right of redemption is an equitable right, foreclosure is an action in equity. To keep the right of redemption, the debtor may be able to petition the court for an injunction. If repossession is imminent, the debtor must seek a temporary restraining order. However, the debtor may have to post a bond in the amount of the debt. This protects the creditor if the attempt to stop foreclosure is simply an attempt to escape the debt. A debtor may also challenge the validity of the debt in a claim against the bank to stop the foreclosure and sue for damages. In a foreclosure proceeding, the lender also bears the burden of proving they have standing to foreclose. Several U.S. states, including California,Arnolds Management Corp. v. Eischen, 158 Cal. App. 3d 575, 205 Cal. Rptr. 15 (1984). Georgia,Berry v. Government Nat. Mortgage Association, 231 Ga. 503, 202 S.E.2d 450 (1973). and TexasGinther- Davis Ctr., Ltd. v. Houston Nat'l Bank, 600 S.W.2d 856, 864 (Tex. Civ. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e). impose a \\"tender\\" condition precedent upon borrowers seeking to challenge a wrongful foreclosure, which is rooted in the maxim of equity principle that \\"he who seeks equity must first do equity\\", as well as the common law rule that the party seeking rescission of a contract must first return all benefits received under the contract. In other words, to challenge an allegedly wrongful foreclosure, the borrower must make legal tender of the entire remaining balance of the debt prior to the foreclosure sale. California has one of the strictest forms of this rule, in that the funds must be received by the lender before the sale. One tender attempt was held inadequate when the check arrived via FedEx on a Monday, three days after the foreclosure sale had already occurred on Friday.Nguyen v. Calhoun, 105 Cal. App. 4th 428, 129 Cal. Rptr. 2d 436 (2003). At least one textbook has attacked the paradox inherent in the tender rule‚Äînamely, if the borrower actually had enough cash to promptly pay the entire balance, they would have already paid it off and the lender would not be trying to foreclose upon them in the first placeGrant S. Nelson and Dale A. Whitman, Real Estate Finance Law, 5th ed. (St. Paul: West, 2007), ¬ß 7.22 at 879.‚Äîbut it continues to be the law in the aforementioned states. Occasionally, borrowers have raised enough cash at the last minute (usually through desperate fire sales of other unencumbered assets) to offer good tender and have thereby preserved their rights to challenge the foreclosure process. Courts have been unsympathetic to attempts by such borrowers to recover fire sale losses from foreclosing lenders.Price v. Wells Fargo Bank, 213 Cal. App. 3d 465, 476, 261 Cal. Rptr. 735 (1989). One noteworthy court case questions the legality of the foreclosure practice is sometimes cited as proof of various claims regarding lending. In the case First National Bank of Montgomery v. Jerome Daly, Jerome Daly claimed that the bank did not offer a legal form of consideration because the money loaned to him was created upon signing of the loan contract. The myth reports that Daly won, did not have to repay the loan, and the bank could not repossess his property. In fact, the \\"ruling\\" (widely referred to as the \\"Credit River Decision\\") was ruled a nullity by the courts. In a recent New York case, the Court rejected a lender's attempt to foreclose on summary judgment because the lender failed to submit proper affidavits and papers in support of its foreclosure action and also, the papers and affidavits that were submitted were not prepared in the ordinary course of business. Many borrowers' attorneys will establish a lender proof of compliance with the 90-day pre-foreclosure notice requirement in order to delay and prolong forecosure proceedings giving the borrower an extra 3 months to clean their record and pay off debt.https://rew-online.com/2016/10/opinion-recent-efforts- to-speed-up-foreclosure-proceedings-in-n-y/ Foreclosure auction When the entity (in the US, typically a county sheriff or designee) auctions a foreclosed property the noteholder may set the starting price as the remaining balance on the mortgage loan. However, there are a number of issues that affect how pricing for properties is considered, including bankruptcy rulings. In a weak market, the foreclosing party may set the starting price at a lower amount if it believes the real estate securing the loan is worth less than the remaining principal of the loan. Time from notice of foreclosures to actual property sales depends on many factors, such as the method of foreclosure (judicial or non-judicial). When the remaining mortgage balance is higher than the actual home value, the foreclosing party is unlikely to attract auction bids at this price level. A house that has gone through a foreclosure auction and failed to attract any acceptable bids may remain the property of the owner of the mortgage. That inventory is called REO (real estate owned). In these situations, the owner/servicer tries to sell it through standard real estate channels. Further borrower's obligations The mortgagor may be required to pay for Private Mortgage Insurance, or PMI, for as long as the principal of his or her primary mortgage is above 80% of the value of his or her property. In most situations, insurance requirements guarantee that the lender gets back some pre-defined proportion of the loan value, either from foreclosure auction proceeds or from PMI or a combination of those. Nevertheless, in an illiquid real estate market or if real estate prices drop, the property being foreclosed could be sold for less than the remaining balance on the primary mortgage loan, and there may be no insurance to cover the loss. In this case, the court overseeing the foreclosure process may enter a deficiency judgment against the mortgagor. Deficiency judgments can be used to place a lien on the borrower's other property that obligates the mortgagor to repay the difference. It gives lender a legal right to collect the remainder of debt out of mortgagor's other assets (if any). There are exceptions to this rule. If the mortgage is a non-recourse debt (which is often the case with owner- occupied residential mortgages in the U.S.), lender may not go after borrower's assets to recoup his losses. Lender's ability to pursue deficiency judgment may be restricted by state laws. In California and some other US states, original mortgages (the ones taken out at the time of purchase) are typically non-recourse loans; however, refinanced loans and home equity lines of credit are not. If the lender chooses not to pursue deficiency judgment‚Äîor cannot because the mortgage is non-recourse‚Äîand accepts the loss, the borrower may have to pay income taxes on the unrepaid amount if it can be considered \\"forgiven debt\\". However, recent changes in tax laws may change the way these amounts are reported. Any liens resulting from other loans against the property being foreclosed (second mortgages, HELOCs) are \\"wiped out\\" by foreclosure. Renegotiation alternative In the wake of the United States housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis there has been increased interest in renegotiation or modification of the mortgage loans rather than foreclosure, and some commentators have speculated that the crisis was exacerbated by the \\"unwillingness of lenders to renegotiate mortgages\\". Several policies, including the U.S. Treasury sponsored Hope Now initiative and the 2009 \\"Making Home Affordable\\" plan have offered incentives to renegotiate mortgages. Renegotiations can include lowering the principal due or temporarily reducing the interest rate. A 2009 study by Federal Reserve economists found that even using a broad definition of renegotiation, only 3% of \\"seriously delinquent borrowers\\" received a modification. The leading theory attributes the lack of renegotiation to securitization and a large number of claimants with security interest in the mortgage. There is some support behind this theory, but an analysis of the data found that renegotiation rates were similar among unsecuritized and securitized mortgages. The authors of the analysis argue that banks don't typically renegotiate because they expect to make more money with a foreclosure, as renegotiation imposes \\"self-cure\\" and \\"redefault\\" risks.Adelino et al. (2009). Why Don‚Äôt Lenders Renegotiate More Home Mortgages? Redefaults, Self-Cures, and Securitization . Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Discussion Paper. Government supported programs such as Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) may provide homeowners the ability to refinance their mortgages if they are unable to obtain a traditional refinance due to their declined home value.\\"Avoiding Foreclosure\\" , HUD.GOV, July 20, 2012 A dual-tracking process appeared to be in use by many lenders, however, where the lender would simultaneously talk to the borrower about a \\"loan modification\\", but also move ahead with a foreclosure sale of the borrower's property. Borrowers were heard to complain that they were misled by these practices and would often be \\"surprised\\" that their home had been sold at foreclosure auction, as they believed they were in a \\"loan modification process\\". California has enacted legislation to eliminate this type of \\"dual-tracking\\" - The Homeowner Bill of Rights - AB 278, SB 900, That went into effect on January 1, 2013.California Homeowner Bill of Rights Reviewed 2013-07-20 Experiences of households post-foreclosure A 2011 research paper by the Federal Reserve Board, ‚ÄúThe Post-Foreclosure Experience of U.S. Households,‚Äù used credit reports from more than 37 million individuals between 1999 and 2010 to measure post-foreclosure behavior, especially in regard to future borrowing and housing consumption. The study found that: 1) On average 23% of people experiencing foreclosure had moved within a year of the foreclosure process starting. In the same time, a control group (not facing foreclosure) had only a 12% migration rate; 2) Only 30% of post- foreclosure borrowers moved to neighborhoods with median income at least 25% lower than their previous neighborhood; 3) The majority of post-foreclosure migrants do not end up in substantially less-desirable neighborhoods or more crowded living conditions; 4) There was no significant difference in household size between the post-foreclosure and control groups. However, only 17% of the post-foreclosure individuals had the same number and composition of household members after a foreclosure than before. By comparison, the control group maintained the same household companions in 46% of cases; and, 5) Only about 20% of post-foreclosure individuals chose to live in households where one person maintained a mortgage. Overall, the authors conclude that it is ‚Äúdifficult to say whether this small effect is because the shock that leads to foreclosure is not long-lasting, because the credit constraints imposed by having a foreclosure on one‚Äôs credit report are not large, or because housing services are more inelastic than other forms of consumption.\\" Reviewed 2013-07-20 Affected demographics Recent housing studies indicate that minority households disproportionately experience foreclosures. Other overly represented groups include African Americans, renter households, households with children, and foreign-born homeowners. For example, statistics show that African American buyers are 3.3 times more likely than white buyers to be in foreclosure, while Latino and Asian buyers are 2.5 and 1.6 times more likely, respectively. As another statistical example, over 60 per cent of the foreclosures that occurred in New York City in 2007 involved rental properties. Twenty percent of the foreclosures nationwide were from rental properties. One reason for this is that the majority of these people have borrowed with risky subprime loans. There is a major lack of research done in this area posing problems for three reasons. One, not being able to describe who experiences foreclosure makes it challenging to develop policies and programs that can prevent/reduce this trend for the future. Second, researchers cannot tell the extent to which recent foreclosures have reversed the advances in homeownership that some groups, historically lacking equal access, have made. Third, research is focused too much on community-level effects even though it is the individual households that are most strongly affected.Allen, R. Who Experiences Foreclosures? The Characteristics of Households Experiencing a Foreclosure in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Housing Studies, 26(6), 845-866. Many people cite their own or their family members medical conditions as the primary reason for undergoing a foreclosure. Many do not have health insurance and are unable to adequately provide for their medical needs. This again points to the fact that foreclosures affects already vulnerable populations.Pollack, C., & Lynch, J. (2009). Health Status of People Undergoing Foreclosure in the Philadelphia Region. American Journal of Public Health, 99(10), 1833-1839. Credit scores are greatly impacted after a foreclosure. The average number of points reduced when you are 30 days late on your mortgage payment is 40 - 110 points, 90 days late is 70 - 135 points, and a finalized foreclosure, short sale or deed-in-lieu is 85 - 160 points.Les Christie, \\"How foreclosure impacts your credit score\\" , CNN Money, April 22, 2012 Recent trends In 2009, the United States Congress tried to rescue the economy with a $700 billion bailout for the financial industry; however, there was a growing consensus that the deepening collapse of the housing market was at the heart of the country's acute economic downturn. After spending billions of dollars rescuing financial institutions only to see the economy spiral even deeper into crisis, both liberal and conservative economists and lawmakers pushed to redirect an economic stimulus bill to what they saw as the core problem: the housing market. But beneath the consensus over helping the housing market, there were huge differences over who should benefit under the competing plans. Democrats wanted to aim money directly at people in the greatest distress; and Republicans wanted to aim money at almost all homebuyers, on the theory that a rising tide would eventually lift all boats. In 2010, there was a 14% increase in the number of homes receiving a default notice between July and September. In that year one in every 45 homes received a foreclosure filing and the problem has become more widespread with the increasing rates of unemployment across the nation. Banks have become extremely aggressive without much patience for those who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments, and there are more families entering the foreclosure process sooner than ever. In 2011, banks were on track to repossess over 800,000 homes.Associated Press. \\"Sharp Rise in Foreclosures as Banks Move in - Business - Real Estate ‚Äì Msnbc.com.\\" NBC News - Breaking News, Science and Tech News, World News, US News, Local News- NBC News.

The geographic diversity of these cities is made up for by the fact they these are all relatively metropolitan areas. Big cities like Houston, Texas saw a 26% increase in 2010, 23% in Seattle, Washington and 21% in Atlanta, Georgia. These cities had the lowest rates of unemployment. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the cities with the lowest rates of foreclosure were Rome, NY; South Burlington, VT; Charleston, WV; Bryan, TX; and Tuscaloosa, AL.Hoak, Amy. \\"Top 10 Cities Where Foreclosure Rates Are Highest ‚Äì MarketWatch.\\"MarketWatch - Stock Market Quotes, Business News, Financial News.

Not surprisingly, these areas had some of the highest nationwide rates of unemployment, helping to further demonstrate this correlation. A quote from RealtyTrac CEO James Saccacio summarizes the recent trends: > ‚ÄúForeclosure floodwaters receded somewhat in 2010 in the nation‚Äôs hardest- > hit housing markets.

This figure falls in the higher spectrum of foreclosure frequency. As of August 2014, the foreclosure rate was 33.7%, 1.7% up from the last year. The rise in foreclosure activity has been most significant in New York and New Jersey, the two most densely populated areas in U.S. Closely following them is Florida.

For any given time frame, foreclosures have a greater negative impact when they are closer to the property attempting to be sold. The conventional view suggested is that the increase in foreclosures will cause declines in the sales value of neighboring properties, which, in turn, will lead to an extension of the housing crisis.Rogers, W. H., & Winter, W. (2009). The Impact of Foreclosures on Neighboring Housing Sales. Journal of Real Estate Research, 31(4), 455-479. Another significant impact from increased foreclosure rates is on school mobility of children. In general, research suggests that switching schools is damaging for children, although this does significantly depend on the quality of the origin and destination schools. A study done in New York City revealed that students who changed schools most often entered a school with lower, on average, test scores and overall school performance. The effect of these moves on academic performance for individual students requires further research.Been, V., Ellen, I., Schwartz, A., Stiefel, L., & Weinstein, M. (2011).

In one particular study of 250 recruited participants who had experienced foreclosure, 36.7% met screening criteria for major depression. By country =Australia and New Zealand= Foreclosure has been prohibited by law in New Zealand for well over a century. Instead the mortgagee realises the security through sale, the exercise of the power of sale also being regulated by statute. In both of these countries statutory reform has altered the manner in which real property dealings are conducted. What is termed a \\"mortgage\\" is a legal interest that is registered against the fee simple title of the property. Since in both countries, the Torrens title system of land registration is used, being registered as proprietor or as a mortgagee creates an indefeasible interest (unless the acquisition of the registration was by land transfer fraud). The mortgagee therefore never holds the fee simple, and there is a statutory process for initiating and conducting a mortgagee sale in the event that the mortgagor defaults. In New Zealand, as in England, say, the land title database is now electronic so there are no paper \\"title documents\\". =Ireland= In Ireland, foreclosure has been abolished by the Land and Conveyancing Reform Act 2009 but Chapter 4 of Part 9 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 provides for vesting orders that are equivalent to foreclosure but may only be used by NAMA. =People's Republic of China= Foreclosure in the People's Republic of China takes place as a form of debt enforcement proceedings under strict judicial foreclosure, which is only allowed by law of guarantee and law of property right. China amended the Constitution of the Peoples's Republic of China (adopted April 12, 1988), to allow transfer of land rights, from \\"granted land rights\\" to \\"allocated land rights\\" thus paving the way for private land ownership, allowing for the renting, leasing, and mortgage of land.

A mortgagee may foreclose either judicially or extrajudicially, as governed by Rule 68 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure and Act. No. 3135, respectively. A judicial foreclosure is done by filing a complaint in the Regional Trial Court of the place where the property is located. The judge renders judgment, ordering the mortgagor to pay the debt within a period of 90‚Äì120 days. If the debt is not paid within the said period, a foreclosure sale satisfies the judgment. In an extrajudicial foreclosure, the mortgagee need not initiate an action in court but may simply file an application before the Clerk of Court to secure attendance of the Sheriff who conducts the public sale. This is done pursuant to a power of sale. Note that these two modes specifically apply to real estate mortgages. Foreclosure of chattel mortgages (mortgage of movable property) are governed by Sec. 14 of Act No. 1506, which gives the mortgagee the right to sell the chattel at a public sale. It has also been held that as regards chattel mortgages, the law does not prohibit that the foreclosure sale be done privately if it is agreed upon by the parties. =Spain= Unlike in the United States, where a foreclosure means the end of the line, the foreclosure hearing in Spain is just the beginning of the homeowner's troubles. They will have to work for the bank for many years and will be unable to ever own anything‚Äîeven a car. Spanish mortgage holders are responsible for the full amount of the loan to the bank in addition to penalty interest charges, and court fees. Much of this can be attributed to Spain having the highest unemployment rate in the \\"euro zone\\". Unlike in the US, bankruptcy is not an adequate solution since mortgage debt is specifically excluded. Unlike other European countries, you cannot go to the courts for any sort of debt relief. There has been much contention over these policies in the Spanish Parliament but the government is convinced that keeping these policies will prevent Spanish banks from ever experiencing something similar to the US mayhem. With repossessed real estate properties on their books worth about ‚Ç¨100 billion the banks in Spain are eager to get rid of foreclosures. =South Africa= For a developing country, there is a high rate of foreclosures in South Africa because of the privatisation of housing delivery. One of the biggest opponents of foreclosures is the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign which sees foreclosures as unconstitutional and a particular burden on vulnerable poor populations.Fighting Foreclosure in South Africa April 7, 2009 =Switzerland= In Switzerland, foreclosure takes place as a form of debt enforcement which is served by the overlord of debt (currently Lord Overton Sheraton) proceedings under Swiss insolvency law. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, foreclosure is a little-used remedy which vests the property in the mortgagee with the mortgagor having neither the right to any surplus from the sale nor liability for any shortfall. Because this remedy can be harsh, courts almost never allow it especially if a large surplus is likely to be realised, furthermore when a substantial surplus is unlikely to be realised then mortgagees are disinclined to seek foreclosure in the first place since that remedy leaves them no recourse to recover a shortfall. Instead, the courts usually grant an order for possession and an order for sale, which both mitigates some of the harshness of the repossession by allowing the sale while allowing lenders further recourse to recover any balance owing following a sale. The United Kingdom foreclosure system is unique and true foreclosures are quite uncommon. More commonly, lenders pursue a process called mortgage possession (or alternatively, \\"repossession\\" in cases where the bank originally sold the property too). Both mortgage (re)possession and foreclosure are quite similar, with the main differences being the treatment of any funds that exceed the amount borrowed and liability for any shortfall. In the case of mortgage possession or repossession, if the home is sold or auctioned for a price that exceeds the loan balance, those funds are returned to the consumer. If the proceeds from a mortgage possession are insufficient to cover the loan then the debtor remains liable for the balance, although in most cases this will become an unsecured debt and the mortgage company will be treated on an equitable basis with the debtor's other unsecured creditors (particularly if the debtor simultaneously or subsequently becomes bankrupt or enters into a voluntary arrangement with creditors). By contrast, in the case of foreclosure the mortgage company retains all rights to proceeds from a sale or auction but the debtor is not liable for any shortfall. The UK foreclosure and mortgage possession/repossession system favors consumers over lenders, as the United Kingdom has some pre-action protocols in place. Mortgage companies are required to work with homeowners to arrive at a resolution and it is possible to delay court action (ultimately, enabling many to avoid the loss of their home) in situations where the borrower has enrolled in individual programs or if the borrower's income is about to improve significantly with a new job or other measures that would allow them to pay off the arrears. There is no precise parallel to an American short sale, although the UK does have a process known as Assisted Voluntary Sale. An Assisted Voluntary Sale does have some negative credit impact for the consumer, but the adverse effect is less pronounced than one might suffer if the case were to proceed to the courts.

Ministers are appointed by the Governor-General, on the advice of the Prime Minister, who is the leader of the cabinet. Cabinet meetings are strictly private and occur once a week where vital issues are discussed and policy formulated. The Cabinet is also composed of a number of Cabinet committees focused on governance and specific policy issues. Outside the Cabinet there is an Outer Ministry and also a number of Assistant Ministers (designated as Parliamentary Secretaries under the Ministers of State Act 1952), responsible for a specific policy area and reporting directly to a senior Cabinet minister of their portfolio. The Cabinet, the Outer Ministry, and the Assistant Ministers collectively form the full Commonwealth Ministry of the government of the day. As with the Prime Minister of Australia, the Constitution of Australia does not recognise the Cabinet as a legal entity; these roles actually exist solely by convention. Decisions of Cabinet do not in and of themselves have legal force. Instead, it convenes to function as a practical \\"foreshadowing\\" of the Business of the Federal Executive Council, which is, officially (as per the Constitution), Australia's highest formal governmental body established by Chapter II of the Constitution of Australia. In practice, the Federal Executive Council meets solely to endorse and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. All members of the Cabinet are members of the Executive Council. While the nominal presiding officer, the Governor-General almost never attends Executive Council meetings. A senior member of the Cabinet holds the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council and acts as presiding officer of the Executive Council in place of the Governor-General.  History  Until 1956 Cabinet comprised all ministers. The growth of the ministry in the 1940s and 1950s made this increasingly impractical, and in 1956 Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies created a two-tier ministry, with only senior ministers being members of Cabinet, while the other ministers are in the outer ministry. This practice has been continued by all governments since, with the exception of the Whitlam Government. When the non-Labor parties have been in power, the Prime Minister has advised the Governor-General on all Cabinet and ministerial appointments at his own discretion, although in practice he consults with senior colleagues in making appointments. When the Liberal Party and its predecessors (the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party) have been in coalition with the National Party (or its predecessor the Country Party), the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right to nominate his party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to be consulted by the Prime Minister on the allocation of their portfolios. When the Labor Party first held office under Chris Watson, Watson assumed the right to choose members of the Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the Caucus, and this practice was followed until 2007. The Prime Minister retained the right to allocate portfolios. In practice, Labor Prime Ministers exercised a predominant influence over who was elected to Labor Cabinets, although leaders of party factions also exercised considerable influence. Under two-tier ministerial arrangements introduced in 1987, each senior or \\"portfolio\\" Minister was a member of the Cabinet. In 1996 this was modified by the Howard government, whereby two portfolio Ministers, one being the Attorney-General, were not members of Cabinet, and one portfolio had two Cabinet Ministers. In subsequent Howard Ministries, and the 2007 Rudd Labor Ministry, all portfolio Ministers were in the Cabinet. Before the 2007 election, Kevin Rudd announced that if Labor won the election he would dispense with this tradition and appoint the ministry himself. In fact, the Caucus rule requiring the election of ministers remains in place. At the first Caucus meeting after the election, Rudd announced the members of his chosen ministry, and the Caucus then elected them unopposed, thus preserving the outward form of Caucus election. Function  In a parliamentary context, the Cabinet is of little procedural consequence; its relationship to Parliament being similar to the relationship between the Ministry as a whole and Parliament. It is fundamentally an administrative mechanism to assist with the decision-making process of the Executive Government.  Composition  Members of both the House of Representatives and Senate are eligible to serve as ministers and parliamentary secretaries. A minister does not have to be a member of either house, but Section 64 of the Constitution of Australia requires the minister to become a member within three months. The Prime Minister and Treasurer are traditionally members of the House of Representatives, but the Constitution does not have such a requirement. As amended in 1987, the Minister of State Act 1952 permits up to 30 ministers. As members of one house cannot speak in the other, ministers in each house serve as representatives of colleagues in the other for answering questions and other procedures. every government since federation has had senators serve as ministers. The Senate typically provides one-quarter to one- third of the ministry. Some former senators and others have proposed that senators should not be eligible to serve as ministers, stating that doing so is inappropriate for members of a chamber that act as the states' house and a house of review and because governments are only responsible to the House of Representatives. John Uhr and Senator Baden Teague state that an advantage of senators serving in ministries is that the Senate can compel them to answer questions about the government. Since the introduction of the two-tier ministry, meetings of Cabinet are attended by members only, although other ministers may attend if an area of their portfolio is on the agenda. Cabinet meetings are chaired by the Prime Minister, and a senior public servant is present to write the minutes and record decisions.FAQ: Executive Government ‚Äì The Cabinet , Parliamentary Education Office. Since 1942, every member of the Cabinet has been a member of the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal Party of Australia, or the National Party of Australia.  Cabinet collective responsibility  The Australian Cabinet follows the traditions of the British parliamentary cabinet system, in following the principle of cabinet collective responsibility. While the Cabinet is responsible to parliament for making policy decisions, Cabinet discussions are confidential and are not disclosed to the public apart from the announcement of decisions. This secrecy is necessary to ensure that items of national security are not made public, and so that ministers can speak freely and disagree with each other during discussions. Ministers are bound by a principle of cabinet solidarity, meaning that once cabinet has made a decision, all ministers must publicly support and defend that decision, regardless of their personal views on the subject.Australia's system of government, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Cabinet documents are held separately from other documents and may be destroyed once no longer in use, or when a change of government occurs.Cabinet Handbook, 5th Edition , p32, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Since 1986, minutes and records of Cabinet meetings are embargoed from public release or disclosure for 30 years.Introduction to the Cabinet and its records , National Archives of Australia. Despite this, several filing cabinets containing classified documents were obtained by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation after they were sold at a government surplus auction. The documents, aspects of which were published in January 2018, reveal the inner workings of recent governments, and have been characterized by the ABC as the largest breach of cabinet security in the nation's history.  Current Cabinet committees  As with other Westminster system cabinets, Cabinet committees play an important role in the effectiveness of the Cabinet system and providing avenues for collective decision-making on particular policy issues. Under the Morrison Government, the following Cabinet committees exist:Australian Government Directory Cabinet Committees The National Security Committee (NSC) focuses on major international security issues of strategic importance to Australia, border protection policy, national responses to developing situations (either domestic or international) and classified matters relating to aspects of operation and activities of the Australian Intelligence Community.

Current Cabinet   Shadow Cabinet  Led by the Leader of the Opposition, the Opposition in parliament appoints from its ranks a Shadow Cabinet to monitor government ministers and present itself as an alternative government. The portfolios of shadow ministers usually correspond with those of the government. When the Liberal and National parties are in Opposition, the Shadow Cabinet is appointed by the Leader of the Opposition in consultation with the Leader of the Nationals. When Labor has been in Opposition, the Caucus has elected the Shadow Ministry and the Leader has allocated portfolios. Smaller opposition parties often appoint spokespersons for Cabinet portfolios, but these are not referred to as a Shadow Cabinet.

Keates, Juliette M. Pasveer, Quaternary Research in Indonesia. Taylor & Francis, 2004. Migration from South China by some of the paternal ancestors of the Bugis is also supported by studies of Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups. The Bugis in 1605 converted to Islam from Animism.Keat Gin Ooi, Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, From Angkor Wat to East Timor. ABC-CLIO, 2004. The main religion embraced by the Bugis is Islam. There are a small number of Bugis who do not take Islam as their religion. Some Bugis converted to Christianity by means of marriage but their number remained small. A Bugis community living in Amparita in the Sidenreng Rappang Regency remains in pre- Islamic belief and is called as Tolotang. Despite the population numbering only around 6 million, the Bugis are influential in the politics in modern Indonesia, and historically influential on the Malay peninsula and other parts of the archipelago where they have migrated, starting in the late seventeenth century. The third president of Indonesia, B.J. Habibie (1998‚Äì1999), and the former Vice President of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla were Bugis, sixth Prime Minister, Najib Razak and current Prime Minister of Malaysia, Muhyiddin Yassin have Bugis ancestry. Although many Bugis people live in the large port cities of Makassar and Parepare, the majority are farmers who grow wet rice on the lowland plains to the north and west of the town of Maros. The name Bugis is an exonym which represents an older form of the name; (To) Ugi is the endonym. The Bugis people speak a distinct regional language in addition to Indonesian, called Basa Ugi, Bugis or Bugis. In reality, there are several dialects, some of which are sufficiently different from others to be considered separate languages. The Bugis language belongs to the South Sulawesi language group; other members include the Maksar language, Torajan, Mandar and Enrekang, each being a series of dialects.Mills, R.F. 1975.

Pictured accompanied by court ladies. =Origin= Homeland in Sulawesi, Indonesia The homeland of the Buginese is the area around Lake Tempe and Lake Sidenreng in the Walannae Depression in the southwest peninsula of Sulawesi. It was here that the ancestors of the present-day Bugis settled, probably in the mid- to late second millennium BC. The area is rich in fish and wildlife and the annual fluctuation of Lake Tempe (a reservoir lake for the Bila and Walannae rivers) allows speculative planting of wet rice, while the hills can be farmed by swidden or shifting cultivation, wet rice, gathering and hunting. Around AD 1200 the availability of prestigious imported goods including Chinese and Southeast Asian ceramics and Gujerati print-block textiles, coupled with newly discovered sources of iron ore in Luwu stimulated an agrarian revolution which expanded from the great lakes region into the lowland plains to the east, south and west of the Walennae depression. This led over the next 400 years to the development of the major kingdoms of South Sulawesi, and the social transformation of chiefly societies into hierarchical proto-states.Caldwell, I. 1995.

The conclusion in 1669 of a protracted civil war led to a diaspora of Bugis and their entry into the politics of the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra. The Bugis played an important role in defeating Jambi and had a huge influence in Sultanate of Johor. Apart from the Malays, another influential faction in Johor at that time was the Minangkabau. Both the Buginese and the Minangkabau realised how the death of Sultan Mahmud II had provided them with the chance to exert power in Johor. Under the leadership of Daeng Parani, the descendants of two families settled on the Linggi and Selangor rivers and became the power behind the Johor throne, with the creation of the office of the Yang Dipertuan Muda (Yam Tuan Muda), or Bugis underking. \\"History\\", Embassy of Malaysia, Seoul In northern Australia Long before European colonialists extended their influence into these waters, the Makassarese, the Bajau, and the Buginese built elegant, ocean-going schooners in which they plied the trade routes. Intrepid and doughty, they travelled as far east as the Aru Islands, off New Guinea, where they traded in the skins of birds of paradise and medicinal masoya bark, and to northern Australia, where they exchanged shells, birds'-nests and mother-of-pearl for knives and salt with Aboriginal tribes. The Buginese sailors left their mark and culture on an area of the northern Australian coast which stretches over two thousand kilometres from the Kimberley to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Throughout these parts of northern Australia, there is much evidence of a significant Bugis presence. Each year, the Bugis sailors would sail down on the northwestern monsoon in their wooden padewakang. They would stay in Australian waters for several months to trade and take trepang (or dried sea cucumber) before returning to Makassar on the dry season off shore winds. As Thomas Forrest wrote in A Voyage from Calcutta to the Mergui Archipelago (1792), S.78 ff., ‚ÄúThe Buggesses in general are a high-spirited people; they will not bear ill usage... They deserve the character given of Malays in general, by Monsieur Poivre, in his Travels of a Philosopher, 'fond of adventures, emigration, and capable of undertaking the most dangerous enterprizes'.‚Äù Lifestyle Bugis traditional clothing. Most present-day Buginese now earn their living as rice farmers, traders or fishermen. Women help with the agricultural cycle and work in the homes. Most Bugis people live in stilted houses, sometimes three meters (9 ft) or more off the ground, with plank walls and floors. Many of the marriages are still arranged by parents and ideally take place between cousins. The Bugis recognise a cousin up to the ninth degree. A newlywed couple often lives with the wife's family for the first few years of their marriage (matrilocal). The Bugis diet consists mainly of rice, maize, fish, chicken, vegetables, fruit and coffee. On festive occasions, goat is served as a special dish. It has been argued that the Bugis people recognise five separate genders. These are makkunrai and oroan√©, which are similar to cisgender male and female respectively, as well as calabai, calalai, and bissu, which are less easily comparable to Western ideas of gender. Religion A few west coast rulers converted to Christianity in the mid-16th century, but failure by the Portuguese at Malacca to provide priests meant that this did not last. In the early 17th century, the Minangkabau ulama, Dato Ri Bandang, Dato Ri Tiro, and Dato Ri Patimang spread Islam in South Sulawesi. The Bugis converted from indigenous animistic practices and beliefs to Islam. By 1611, all the Makasar and Bugis kingdoms had converted to Islam. According to Nurman Said 95% of the Bugis are Muslims. There are a small number of Bugis who do not take Islam as their religion. Some Bugis converted to Christianity by means of marriage but their number remained small. A Bugis community living in Amparita in the Sidenreng Rappang Regency remains in pre-Islamic belief and is called as Tolotang. Because most Bugis people are Muslims, the Hajj is seen as a prestige by them. In literature A settlement of Bugis people in the fictional country of Patusan plays a key role in Joseph Conrad's novel Lord Jim.

Early life  Bonnet was born in Bassillac, Dordogne, the son of a lawyer.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 98. He studied law and political science at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques and Sorbonne.  Early career  He went to work as an auditeur at the Conseil d'√©tat. In 1911, he launched a political career after marrying Odette Pelletan, the granddaughter of Eugene Pelletan. Bonnet's wife, often known as Madame Soutien-Georges, ran a salon, and had great ambitions for her husband; one contemporary reported that Madame Bonnet was \\"so wildly ambitious for her husband that when a new ministry was being formed he was afraid to go home at night unless he had captured a post for himself.\\"Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 104. Many privately mocked Bonnet for the way in which his wife dominated him.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 160. The moniker \\"Madame Soutien-Georges\\" directed towards her was a French pun on the word for \\"brassiere\\" (soutien-gorge) and was both a reference to Madame Bonnet and to the size of her breasts. In 1914, Bonnet joined the French Army and in 1918 served as director of demobilization. During his service in World War I, Bonnet was a much-decorated soldier who won the Croix de guerre medal for bravery under fire.Young, Robert France and the Origins of the Second World War, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1996 page 146. In 1919, Bonnet served as a secretary to the French delegation at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and wrote a book, Lettres √° un Bourgeois de 1914, that called for widespread social reforms. Bonnet served in the Chamber of Deputies from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1929 to 1940. He was appointed undersecretary of state in 1925, the first in a series of high ministerial positions throughout the 1920s and 1930s. During his time as in the Chamber, Bonnet was regarded as a leading expert in financial and economic matters. As a minister, Bonnet had a reputation for hard work, always being well prepared in parliamentary debates and excelling at political intrigue. In 1932, Bonnet headed the French delegation at the Lausanne Conference.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 99. During the Lausanne Conference, British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, commenting on Bonnet's abilities, asked: \\"Why isn't he in the Cabinet?\\". In 1933, Bonnet was a prominent member of the French delegation to the London Conference, where he was a leading critic of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's actions during the conference.Morrison, Rodney \\"The London Monetary and Economic Conference of 1933: A Public Goods Analysis\\" American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Volume 52, Number. 3, July 1993 pages 312 & 314. In 1936, Bonnet emerged as the leader of 18 Radical deputies who objected to their party's participation in the Front Populaire. As a result, the French Premier L√©on Blum effectively exiled Bonnet in January 1937 by appointing him Ambassador to the United States, even though Bonnet did not speak English. Upon hearing of Bonnet's appointment, the American Ambassador to France, William Christian Bullitt, Jr. wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt about Bonnet: > I don't think you'll like him. He is extremely intelligent and competent on > economic and financial matters, but he's not a man of character. You may > remember that he led the French delegation to the London economic conference > where he led the attacks against you.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the > Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 254. Despite his short stay in the United States and his inability to speak English, Bonnet thereafter and for the rest of his life claimed to be an expert on all things American.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision- Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 pages 224‚Äì225 On 28 June 1937, Bonnet returned to France when the Premier Camille Chautemps appointed him Finance Minister.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 251. Bonnet's first major act as Finance Minister was to oversee the devaluation of the franc (the second devaluation in less than nine months), with the value of the franc going from 110.8 francs per British pound to 147.20. The devaluation was forced on Bonnet by the fact that the 10 billion francs that had been set aside in September 1936 in a Currency Reserve Fund to defend the value of the franc following the devaluation of that year had been spent by the middle of 1937. As Finance Minister, Bonnet imposed sharp cuts in military spending.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 240‚Äì242. Bonnet felt that the costs of the arms race with Germany were such that it was better for France to reach an understanding that might end the arms race than continue to spend gargantuan sums on the military.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 240. Besides for the economic problems associated with budgetary stability and his attempts to maintain the value of the franc against currency speculation, Bonnet was concerned with the social conflict caused by the need for increased taxation and decreased social services to pay for arms.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 242‚Äì244. In a meeting with Franz von Papen, the German Ambassador to Austria, in November 1937, Bonnet and Chautemps expressed the hope that an understanding might be reached in which France might accept Central and Eastern Europe as Germany's sphere of influence in return for German acceptance of Western Europe as France's sphere of influence.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 241. Moreover, Bonnet became the leading spokesman within the French Cabinet for the idea that the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called cordon sanitaire, was a net liability that only served to embroil France in conflicts with Germany.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Lettenacke, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 240. Throughout his career, Bonnet was noted as an advocate of \\"sacred egoism\\" and that France must do what helped French interests over any other country's.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 272. Bonnet regarded himself as a \\"realist\\", and his thinking on foreign policy tended to be colored in equal measure by pragmatism and insularity.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 130. Bonnet's cuts in military spending led to a clash with War Minister √âdouard Daladier. Daladier persuaded the Cabinet to rescind the most severe cuts to the French Army budget, pointing out that in the current international climate, the Army needed more funding, not less.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Lettenacke, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 241‚Äì242. Since the Ministers of the Air and the Marine were not as substantial personalities as Daladier, the French Navy and French Air Force were not able to reverse the Finance Minister's cuts.Frankstein, Robert \\"French Appeasement Policies\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen & Lothar Lettenacke, George Allen & Unwin: London, United Kingdom, 1983 page 242. In January 1938, following the fall of Chautemps's government, Bonnet made a serious effort to form a new government, but in the end, had to content himself with being appointed Minister of State.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 99‚Äì100.  Foreign Minister, 1938‚Äì1939  = Before the May Crisis = In April 1938, following the fall of the second Blum government, Bonnet was appointed Foreign Minister under Daladier as Premier (despite their quarrel in 1937, they had reconciled). Bonnet was a staunch supporter of the Munich Agreement in 1938 and was firmly opposed to taking military action against German expansion; for the most part, he preferred to follow a course of appeasement. In 1938‚Äì1939, there were three factions within the French government. One, led by Bonnet, felt that France could not afford an arms race with Nazi Germany and sought a d√©tente with the Reich.Frankenstein, Robert \\"The Decline of France and French Appeasement Policies, 1936-9\\" pages 236‚Äì245 from The Fascist Challenge and the Policy of Appeasement edited by Wolfgang Mommsen and Lothar Kettenacker, George Allen & Unwin, London, United Kingdom, 1983 pages 240‚Äì243.Jackson, Peter \\"Intelligence and the End of Appeasement\\" pages 234‚Äì260 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power edited by Robert Boyce, London, United Kingdom: Routledge, 1998 page 246. As an expert in financial matters and a former Finance minister, Bonnet was acutely aware of the damages inflicted by the arms race on an economy already weakened by the Great Depression. A second faction, led by Paul Reynaud, Jean Zay, and Georges Mandel, favored a policy of resistance to German expansionism. A third faction, led by Daladier, stood halfway between the other two and favored appeasement of Germany to buy time to re-arm. Daladier thus left foreign policy largely to Bonnet as the best way of avoiding a war with Germany in 1938.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 225. In addition, Daladier felt that the best way of watching Bonnet was to include him in the Cabinet: he wished to keep the Popular Front, but Bonnet wanted it to end.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power pages 224‚Äì225. Daladier's thought if Bonnet were outside of the Cabinet, his ability to engage in intrigues to break up the Popular Front and seize the Premiership for himself would be correspondingly increased; including him in the Cabinet limited his room to manoeuvre. An additional complication in the Daladier-Bonnet relationship was posed by Bonnet's desire for the premiership, which gradually led to a breakdown with his once warm relations with Daladier.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 109‚Äì110. Bonnet was extremely critical of what he regarded as the \\"warmongers\\" of the Quai d'Orsay, and from the very beginning of his time as foreign minister, he tended to exclude his senior officials from the decision-making progress, preferring instead to concentrate authority in his own hands.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 224. In Bonnet's opinion, the French-Czechoslovakian treaty of 1924, which committed France to come to the aid of CzechoSlovakia in the event of a German invasion, was a millstone that could lead France into a disastrous war with Germany.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 161 Bonnet believed that the best course for France in 1938 was to pressure the Czechoslovak government into conceding to German demands and so prevent a Franco-German war. If the Czechoslovaks refused to make concessions, that refusal could be used as an excuse for ending the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance. While pursuing this course, Bonnet kept uninformed not only his senior officials at the Quai d'Orsay, but also sometimes even Daladier himself. This led the Premier to rebuke his Foreign Minister several times for behaving as if French foreign policy was made by \\"one minister\\".May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 pages 162‚Äì163 Between 27 and 29 April 1938, Bonnet visited London with Daladier for meetings with Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax to discuss the possibility of a German-Czechoslovak war breaking out, and what the two governments could do to stop such a war. During the talks, the French ministers argued for firm declarations that both nations would go to war in the event of a German aggression and agreed to a British suggestion that the two nations pressure Prague into making concessions to the Sudeten Heimfront of Konrad Henlein. The London summit marked the beginning of a pattern that was to last throughout 1938, where the French would begin talks with the British by demanding a harder line against the Reich, and then agree to follow the British line.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 180. In the view of Bonnet and Daladier, these tactics allowed them to carry out their foreign policy goals while providing them with a cover from domestic critics by presenting their foreign policy as the result of British pressure.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 180; Young, Robert France and the Origins of the Second World War, New York: St. Martin's Press, 1996 page 58. As Bonnet told the American Ambassador William Christian Bullitt, Jr., his \\"whole policy was based on allowing the British full latitude to work out the dispute\\" because otherwise, France would have to bear the main responsibility for pressuring concessions on Czechoslovakia. Throughout summer 1938, Bonnet allowed most of the diplomatic pressure applied to President Edvard Bene≈° for concessions to Henlein to come from London. This led to sharp complaints from the British that Bonnet should do more to apply pressure on Bene≈°.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 189 & 194. Between 9 and 14 May 1938, Bonnet attended the meeting of the League Council of the League of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 363. During the meeting, Bonnet met with the Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov, who offered vague and evasive answers to Bonnet's questions about what the Soviet Union proposed to do in the event of a German attack on Czechoslovakia. At the same time, Bonnet was informed by the Polish and Romanian delegations that if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, they would refuse the Red Army transit rights to Czechoslovakia's aid and that any Soviet violation of their neutrality would be resisted with force.Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 pages 363‚Äì364. After the League meeting, Bonnet met with Lord Halifax in Paris, where he urged Halifax to \\"work as hard as he could for a settlement in Czechoslovakia so that the French would not be faced with a crisis which they definitely did not want to face\\".Weinberg, Gerhard The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany Starting World War II, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980 page 364. As Halifax reported to the British Cabinet, Bonnet: \\"wanted His Majesty's Government to put as much pressure as possible on Dr. Bene≈° to reach a settlement with the Sudeten-Deutsch in order to save France from the cruel dilemma between dishonouring her agreement [the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924] or becoming involved in war\\". = May Crisis = During the May Crisis of 1938, on 21 May, Bonnet advised Lord Halifax that Britain should warn Berlin that if the Germans attacked Czechoslovakia, then Britain would become involved in the ensuing war, only to be informed that London had already delivered such a warning.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 190. In a talk with the British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, Bonnet attacked Bene≈° for ordering Czechoslovak mobilization without informing France first and criticized Prague's for its \\"hasty action\\", but at a meeting with the Czechoslovak Minister to Paris, ≈†tefan Osusk√Ω, on 21 May, Bonnet did not criticize Prague in violation of his promises to Phipps. Phipps urged Bonnet to use the crisis as an excuse to renounce the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924, but Bonnet refused unless France could secure a stronger commitment from Britain to come to France's aid in the event of war with Germany. During the crisis, Bonnet issued a cautiously-worded press statement supporting Prague, but refused to issue a d√©marche in Berlin.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 191. At a subsequent meeting with Phipps on 22 May, Bonnet was informed not to interpret the British warnings to Berlin during the May Crisis as a blank cheque for British support for either Czechoslovakia or France. Bonnet took \\"copious notes\\" on the British message and stated: \\"if Czechoslovakia were really unreasonable, the French Government might well declare that France considered herself released from her bond\\". On 25 May 1938, Bonnet told the German Ambassador to France, Count Johannes von Welczeck, that France would honour her alliance with Czechoslovakia should Germany invade that nation and highlighted his main foreign policy goals when he declared: \\"if the problem of the minorities in Czechoslovakia was settled peacefully, economic and disarmament problems might be considered\\". On 31 May 1938, Bonnet refused a British request for an Anglo-French d√©marche to Bene≈° demanding concessions to the Sudeten German Heimfront, but promised to commit the French Minister in Prague, Victor de Lacroix, to do more to pressure the Czechoslovaks. In his instructions to Lacroix for the d√©marche, Bonnet instead merely asked for more information and stated: \\"The information that you have transmitted to me on the state of the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the representatives of the Sudetens does not allow me to pronounce as fully as the British Government believes itself able to do on the character and substance of M. Henlein's proposals.... I ask you, therefore to obtain urgently the necessary details on the proposals submitted to M. Hod≈æa....\\"Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 192. The British discovery of Bonnet's instructions, which Lacroix inadvertently revealed to the British Minister in Prague, Sir Basil Newton, led to much Anglo-French recrimination. = To Munich = Bonnet was the leading voice for appeasement in France. He was a \\"munichois\\"‚Äîthat is, a defeatist and pacifist.Daniel Hucker, \\"Public Opinion between Munich and Prague: The View from the French Embassy.\\" Contemporary British History 25.3 (2011): 407‚Äì427. Throughout the spring and early summer of 1938, Bonnet refused to apply pressure through official channels and instead used unofficial emissaries to carry the message that France might not go to war in the event of a German invasion, leading Prague to place more assurance on French statements of public support that was warranted.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 194. Bonnet had his friend, the journalist Jules Saurerwein, tell Bene≈° in an interview,:\\"Victory is not a state that endures forever\\".Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 217. Not until 17 July 1938 did Bonnet issue a set of instructions to Lacroix, which explicitly warned Bene≈° and his Prime Minister, Milan Hod≈æa that because of the attitude of the British, France could not risk a war in 1938, and Prague should do its utmost to reach a settlement with Germany.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 197. Starting with the May Crisis, Bonnet began a campaign of lobbying the United States to become involved in European affairs, asking that Washington inform Prague that in the event of a German-Czechoslovak war the \\"Czech government would not have the sympathy of the American government if it should not attempt seriously to produce a peaceful solution... by making concessions to the Sudeten Germans which would satisfy Hitler and Henlein\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 208. In a meeting with the American Ambassador William Christian Bullitt, Jr. on 16 May 1938, Bonnet stated his belief that another war with Germany would be more dreadful then any previous war and that Bonnet \\"would fight to the limit against the involvement of France in the war\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 209. As part of his effort to gain Bullitt's trust, Bonnet showed the American notes received from the British government during the May crisis.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 177. In a radio broadcast sent directly to the United States on 4 July 1938, Bonnet proclaimed his belief in the \\"common ideals\\" that linked France and the United States as a way of pressuring for greater American interest in the crisis in Central Europe. In June 1938, there was a major dispute between Daladier and Bonnet over the question of continuing French arms shipments to the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. The Italian intervention in the Spanish Civil War had created a major strategic problem for French policy-makers. Because of Germany's greater population, it was considered crucial in France to tap the vast manpower of North Africa to compensate for it. This strategy required French control of the western Mediterranean to ensure that no inference would be possible with troop convoys from Algeria to Marseilles. As a result of the Italian intervention in Spain's civil war, a number of Italian bases had been set up in the strategic Balearic Islands. It was widely feared in France that the Italians would at least receive permission from the Spanish Nationalists to make their presence in the Balerics permanent or even would ask for and receive the cession of the Balearics. The prospect of a Franco-German war breaking out with the Italians siding with the latter and using the Balearics to make naval and air attacks on French troop convoys was considered to be highly undesirable by French decision-makers and a major objective of French foreign policy in the late 1930s was to remove the Italians from the Balearics. Daladier was in favor of continuing arms shipments to the Spanish Republicans as long as the Italian forces were in Spain, but Bonnet argued for ending arms supplies as a way of improving relations with Italy and even told the British Ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, that his country should \\"lay great stress with Daladier on the importance to the Pyrenees frontier remaining closed\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 188 It was Bonnet's hope that ending arms supplies for the Spanish Republic would be reciprocated by a total Italian withdraw from all Spanish territory, especially the Balearics. Bonnet was successful in having the frontier closed. Following reports from General Joseph Vuillemin of the French Air Force after a visit to Germany about the strength of the Luftwaffe, and a memo from Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, the French Ambassador to Germany, on 18 August 1938 stating it was quite likely that Adolf Hitler planned to attack Czechoslovakia sometime soon, Bonnet began quite insistent that a joint Anglo- French warning be sent to Berlin against plans to invade Czechoslovakia. On 22 August 1938, Bonnet had Charles Corbin, the French Ambassador in London, press for an explicit British commitment to come to France's side in the event of war breaking out in Central Europe and used the ensuing British refusal as a reason to justify France's lack of intervention in a German-Czechoslovak conflict.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 202‚Äì203 Starting in August 1938, Bonnet started to become hostile towards what he felt was Daladier's excessive belligerence and lack of willingness to compromise with the Germans and often urged in private that Daladier change his stance. In early September 1938, as part of his effort to prevent war through a mixture of threat and conciliation, Bonnet had a series of meetings with Count Welczeck, telling him that France would honor the terms of the Franco-Czechoslovak treaty should the Germans invade Czechoslovakia, while insisting that his government was quite open to a compromise solution.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision- Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 218. During a speech delivered on 4 September 1938 at the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at Pointe de Grave honoring La Fayette's's departure to America in 1777 and the arrival of the American Expeditionary Force in 1917, Bonnet stated in obliquely that France would go to war if Germany attacked Czechoslovakia and expressed the hope that the US would fight on France's side. During the same ceremony, Ambassador Bullitt stated that \\"France and the United States were united in war and peace\\", leading to a storm of criticism by American isolationists and a statement from President Franklin D. Roosevelt that it was \\"100 per cent wrong\\" the U.S. would join a \\"stop-Hitler bloc\\". Roosevelt's statement had the effect of confirming Bonnet in his course of seeking to avoid a war with Germany.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 209‚Äì210. In addition, a highly exaggerated estimate of the strength of the Luftwaffe presented by Charles Lindbergh in August 1938, supplemented by a highly negative assessment of the ability of the Arm√©e de l'Air by the Air Force's General Joseph Vuillemin to survive a war had the effect of reinforcing Bonnet's determination to avoid a war with Germany.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 240‚Äì242. When it appeared quite likely in mid-September 1938 that war could break out at any moment in Central Europe following Hitler's violent speech blasting Czechoslovakia on 12 September and a failed revolt in the Sudetenland, Bonnet become quite frantic in his efforts to save the peace.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 210 Bonnet told Phipps: \\"I repeated all this with emotion to Sir Eric Phipps telling him that at no price should we allow ourselves to be involved in war without having weighted all the consequences and without having measured in particular the state of our military forces\\". On 14 September, Bonnet told Phipps: \\"We cannot sacrifice ten million men in order to prevent three and half million Sudetens joining the Reich\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 211 Bonnet went on to advocate as his preferred solution to the crisis the neutralization of Czechoslovakia with wide-ranging autonomy for the Sudetenland, but he was prepared as a \\"last resort\\" to accept a plebiscite on the Sudetenlanders joining Germany. During the same speech, Bonnet \\"expressed great indignation with the Czechs who, it seems, mean to mobilise without consulting the French... he has therefore given a broad hint to Bene≈° that France may have to reconsider her obligations\\", and that \\"we are not ready for war and we must therefore make the most far-reaching concessions to the Sudetens and to Germany\\". At a summit meeting in London with the leading British ministers on 18 September, Bonnet and Daladier agreed formally to the idea of ceding the Sudetenland to Germany, but pressed strongly as the price for making such a concession, a British guarantee of the remainder of Czechoslovakia.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 213‚Äì214 On his return to Paris, in a meeting with ≈†tefan Osusk√Ω, Bonnet was very vehement for Prague to agree to the Anglo-French plan agreed to in London at once.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 215 In a letter to Daladier on 24 September 1938, Bonnet wrote, \\"If France declared war against Germany, her position would be weaker than at any time since 1919. In fact, France in this case would have to stand alone on land the force of the combined German and Italian armies, without counting Japan, which in the Far East, will doubtless attack Indo-China.... For five months, night and day, in the course of our confident collaboration, we have struggled for peace. I beg you to continue in this course. It is the only one which can save the country....\\"Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 221 At the same time, Bonnet's relations with Ren√© Massigli, the Quai d'Orsay's Political Director, began to deteriorate quite rapidly as Massigli felt that Bonnet was too anxious to avoid a war at any price.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\", p. 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 227. On 25 September 1938, Daladier and Bonnet returned to London for another set of meetings with British leaders; during this summit, Bonnet said almost nothing.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 220. When Britain rejected Hitler's Bad Godesberg ultimatum on 26 September, Bonnet sought to prevent the news of the British rejection appearing in the French press, as it now appeared that British were pushing the French towards war, and deprived Bonnet of using British pressure as an excuse.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 220‚Äì221 As the crisis reached its climax in late September 1938, Bonnet called upon his peace lobby, a collection of various politicians, journalists and industrialists to pressure the Cabinet against going to war for Czechoslovakia.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power pages 225‚Äì226. Some of the prominent members of Bonnet's \\"peace lobby\\" were the politicians' Jean Mistler, Henri B√©renger, Jean Montigny, Anatole de Monzie, Fran√ßois Pi√©tri, Lucien Lamoureux, Joseph Caillaux, the industrialist Marcel Boussac, and the journalists Jacques Sauerwein, Emile Roche, L√©on Bass√©e, and Emmanuel Berl. Together with Bonnet, the peace lobby sought to influence the government both within the corridors of power and by appealing to public opinion.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power page 226. In this regard, Bonnet especially valued the contribution of his close friend Bass√©e, who served as the political director of the Havas news agency. Another unofficial member of the \\"peace lobby\\" was Phipps, whose dispatches to London often reflected Bonnet's influence. The most celebrated of Phipps's dispatches was a message on 24 September 1938 which claimed that \\"all that is best in France is against war, almost at any price\\" and that they were opposed by a \\"small, but noisy and corrupt, war group\\". In the aftermath of the British rejection of the Bad Godesberg ultimatum, Daladier stated at a Cabinet meeting that if Hitler persisted with the terms of the ultimatum, France \\"intended to go to war\\".Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 132. At a Cabinet meeting on 27 September, Bonnet spoke out against French mobilization and threatened to resign if the Cabinet were to order such a step.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 222 The atmosphere at the Cabinet meeting was very tense as Daladier insisted upon mobilization; this led to many heated words between the Premier and his Foreign Minister.Lacaze, Yvon \\"Daladier, Bonnet and the Decision-Making Process During the Munich Crisis, 1938\\" pages 215‚Äì233 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 The Decline and Fall of A Great Power pages 221. = Munich = The crisis was suddenly averted on 29 September, when Chamberlain announced that he had received an invitation from Benito Mussolini for a four- power conference to be held on 30 September in Munich to settle the crisis. Bonnet was very much in favor of the Munich conference of 30 September, which averted the war Bonnet opposed, but he was not part of the French delegation to it.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 224 After the Munich Conference, Bonnet visited his hometown of P√©rigueux, where he was greeted with a deluge of flowers and shouts of \\"Vive Bonnet!\\" and \\"Merci Bonnet!\\"Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 133. = 1938 after Munich = Relations between Bonnet and his officials at the Quai d'Orsay, especially Ren√© Massigli were very poor, leading to Bonnet to condemn Massigli quite strongly in his memoirs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 149 In turn, Massigli was to accuse Bonnet of seeking to alter the documentary record in his favor.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 142 In the aftermath of Munich, relations between Bonnet and Massigli, which were poor to begin with, declined even further. On 24 October 1938, Bonnet had Massigli sacked as the Quai d'Orsay's Political Director and exiled him by having him serve as Ambassador to Turkey.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 316. Massiglii first learnt of his sacking by reading his morning newspaper.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 179. On the same day that Massigli was exiled, Pierre Comert, the Director of the Quai d'Orsay's Press Service, whose news releases during the Czechoslovak crisis were not in accord with the line that Bonnet wanted to hear, was sent off to the American department.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 73. Bonnet had also wanted to sack the Quai d'Orsay's Secretary-General Alexis Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger and replace him with a man more in tune with Bonnet's views, but Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger's increasing friendship with Daladier served to protect him. A popular legend has it that Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger was not fired because he knew too much about stock market speculations that Bonnet was alleged to have engaged in during the war crisis of September 1938, but there is no evidence to support this story.May, Ernest Strange Victroy, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000 page 179. In the aftermath of the purge, Bonnet was congratulated by Phipps for removing the \\"warmongers\\" Massigli and Comert from the Quai d'Orsay, but Phipps went on to complain that Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger should have been sacked as well. In response, Bonnet claimed that he and Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger saw \\"eye to eye\\", leading to Phipps, who knew about the true state of relations between the two to remark drily, \\"in that case the eyes must be astigmatic\\". On 2 October 1938, the Royal Marine General Sir Maurice Hankey wrote in his diary about the recent visit to Paris by Sir Winston Churchill and Sir Edward Spears to contact anti-appeasement politicians in France: \\"Winston Churchill's sudden visit to France by aeroplane, accompanied by General Spears, and his visit only to the members of the French government like Mandel, who is opposed to the policy of peace, was most improper-Bonnet, the French Foreign Minister has complained about it, asking what we would say if our prominent French statesmen did the same: he has also protested against being rung up by Churchill and Spears from London for information\\".Kersaudy, Fran√ßois Churchill and de Gaulle, Saddle Brook: Stratford Press, 1981 page 32 On 19 October 1938, at the last meeting between the French Ambassador to Germany Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet and Adolf Hitler, the former had suggested to the latter that a Franco-German Declaration of Friendship might offer a way of improving relations between the two countries and avoiding a repeat of the crisis of September 1938. When Fran√ßois-Poncet reported to Paris Hitler's favorable attitude towards such a declaration, and his willingness to send his Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, to Paris to sign the proposed declaration, Bonnet enthusiastically embraced the idea. Bonnet felt that such a declaration might open the way for a series of economic and cultural agreements that would end forever the prospect of another Franco-German war. Bonnet was also jealous over the Anglo-German Declaration of 30 September that Chamberlain had forced upon Hitler after the Munich Conference and wanted his own declaration.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 72. In October 1938, the French opened secret talks with the Americans to start buying American aircraft to make up productivity deficiencies in the French aircraft industry.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 pages 234‚Äì235 Daladier commented that \\"If I had three or four thousand aircraft Munich would never have happened\\".Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 234 Major problems in the Franco-American talks were the issue of how the French were to pay for the American planes and the implications of American neutrality acts.Keylor, William, \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 pages 235‚Äì236 In addition, the American Johnson Act forbade loans to nations that had defaulted on their debts.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 237 In February 1939, the French offered to cede their possessions in the Caribbean and the Pacific together with a lump sum payment of ten billion francs.Keylor, William \\"France and the Illusion of American Support, 1919‚Äì1940\\" pages 204‚Äì244 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 238 Throughout his career, Bonnet was widely respected for his intelligence but often inspired great mistrust in others, in part because of his highly secretive methods of working and his preference for verbal as opposed to written instructions.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 74‚Äì75; Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 103 & 141‚Äì142 During his time as Foreign Minister, Bonnet was distrusted by the British, Daladier and senior officials in the Quai d'Orsay, all of whom suspected that he was in some way not quite being honest with them. Neville Chamberlain described Bonnet as \\"clever, but ambitious and an intriguer\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 102 Georges Mandel said: \\"His long nose sniffs danger and responsibility from afar. He will hide under any flat stone to avoid it\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 103 The French columnist Andr√© G√©raud, who wrote under the pen-name Pertinax, stated that Bonnet pursued only the line \\"of least resistance\\". Sir Winston Churchill described him as \\"the quintessence of defeatism\\". In December 1938, Lord Halifax's private secretary Oliver Harvey referred to Bonnet as \\"a public danger to his own country and to ours\\". In December 1939, the British Chief Diplomatic Advisor Robert Vansittart wrote: \\"As to M. Bonnet he had better trust to time and oblivion rather than to coloured self-defence. He did a lot of really dirty work in 1938... if I ever had to play cards with M. Bonnet again I would always run through the pack first, just to make sure that the joker had been duly removed\\". And throughout Berlin Diary the author William L. Shirer referred to him as \\"the insufferable Georges Bonnet\\". Others were more sympathetic to Bonnet. Lord Halifax wrote in response to Vansittart's memo that: \\"I am disposed to think but I know it is a minority view that M. Bonnet is not so black (or so yellow) as he is often painted\\". Joseph Paul-Boncour, a political opponent of Bonnet's, spoke of his great \\"kindness and help\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 104 The editor of the Le Petit Parisien, √âlie J. Bois, felt that Bonnet had \\"the makings of a good, perhaps a great, foreign minister\\". On another occasion, Bois, who disliked Bonnet, wrote of Bonnet's \\"features... instinct with... the intelligence of a fox on the alert\\". Bonnet's friend, Anatole de Monzie, commented: \\"Whilst very courageous in the long run, he is much less so in the heat of the moment.... Because he is reticent, he is accused of lying or of deceit. False accusation.... Bonnet is discreet so that his policy may be successful.... There is in him an obvious ability, an excessive flexibility. He jumps too quickly, on to the bandwagon, on to all bandwagons. What does it matter to me?... If he aims for the goal and means to reach it by devious means, I care only for the goal. Now I note that having adopted the peace party, he is sticking to it with all the foresight of a statesman\\". The French historian Yvon Lacaze has argued against the popular image of Bonnet as a slick and amoral opportunist, and instead attributes Bonnet's views about avoiding another war with Germany to his memories of service in the trenches of World War I. On 30 November 1938, there were \\"spontaneous\\" demonstrations in the Italian Chamber of Deputies organized by Benito Mussolini and his Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, who demanded that France cede Tunisia, Corsica and French Somaliland to Italy.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 323. In response, Bonnet sent out a message to Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet, now the French Ambassador in Rome, to inform him that he should see Count Ciano to complain:\\"Such behavior may appear rather unusual in the presence of the French Ambassador and immediately following the unconditional recognition of the Italian Empire\\", referring to the annexation of Ethiopia. In the fall of 1938, Bonnet started to advocate the ending of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe and ordered his officials at the Quai d'Orsay to start preparing grounds for renouncing the French treaties with the Soviet Union and Poland.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 265‚Äì266. Speaking before the Foreign Affairs Commission on the Chamber of Deputies in October 1938, Bonnet spoke of his desire to \\"restructure\\" the French alliance system in Eastern Europe and of his wish to \\"renegotiate\\" treaties which might bring France into a war \\"when French security is not directly threatened\\".Jackson, Peter \\"Intelligence and the End of Appeasement\\" pages 234‚Äì260 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 edited by Robert Boyce, London, United Kingdom: Routledge, 1998 page 244. In his efforts to end the eastern alliances, Bonnet found his hands tied by opposition from other members of the French government. As he noted during talks in October with a group of Deputies who had formally asked the Foreign Minister to end French commitments in Eastern Europe: \\"If I was free, I would carry out your policy; but I am not: I would have against me the majority of the Cabinet, led by Reynaud and Mandel, and I cannot count on Daladier, for Gamelin believes that in the event of war Polish military assistance would be indispensable\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 266. As part of his general tendency towards seeking to weaken the French eastern alliances, Bonnet did his best to put off giving the international guarantee to Czecho-Slovakia that France had promised in the Munich Agreement.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 269‚Äì270. On 25 November 1938, Bonnet informed the French Ambassador to Poland, L√©on No√´l, that France should find an excuse for terminating the 1921 Franco- Polish alliance, but found that his views on this issue created considerable opposition within the Quai d'Orsay, where it was argued that Poland was too valuable an ally to be abandoned, and that if France renounced the Polish alliance, Warsaw would align herself with Berlin (the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel J√≥zef Beck was widely, if erroneously, believed in France to be pro- German).Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 271. In December 1938, during the visit of the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to Paris to sign the largely meaningless French-German non-aggression pact,France Signs \\"No- War\\" Pact with Germany, Chicago Tribune, 7 December 1938 Ribbentrop had conversations with Bonnet that he later claimed included a promise to him that France would recognize all of Eastern Europe as Germany's exclusive sphere of influence. This led to a long war of words between the two foreign ministers in the summer of 1939 over just what precisely Bonnet actually said to Ribbentrop.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 290‚Äì292. Ribbentrop was to use Bonnet's alleged statement to convince Hitler that France would not go to war in the defence of Poland in 1939. Both Bonnet and Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger were quite vehement in insisting that no such remark was ever made.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 75. =The Danzig crisis= In January 1939, Bonnet commissioned a study for the French cabinet that concluded that the 1935 Franco-Soviet alliance was now defunct, and there were no grounds for hope about help from the Soviet Union.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 331. Rumours in the French press over the winter of 1938‚Äì39 that France was seeking the end of the eastern alliances generated concerns both in the Chamber of Deputies and in the press, leading Bonnet to state in a speech to the Chamber on 26 January 1939: \\"So, gentlemen, let us dispose of the legend that our policy has destroyed the engagements that we have contracted in Eastern Europe with the USSR and with Poland. These engagements remain in force and they must be applied in the same spirit in which they were conceived\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War 1936‚Äì1939, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 276. In response to Bonnet's speech, Ribbentrop summoned the French Ambassador to Germany, Robert Coulondre, on 6 February 1939 to offer a formal protest over his speech.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 321 Ribbentrop told Coulondre that because of Bonnet's alleged statement of 6 December 1938 accepting Eastern Europe as Germany's zone of influence meant that \\"France's commitments in Eastern Europe\\" were now \\"off limits\\".Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 321 Besides seeking to end the cordon sanitaire, Bonnet's major initiative in foreign policy after Munich was a series of economic agreements he sought to negotiate with the Germans. Bonnet's economic diplomacy was intended to achieve four goals: *He wanted to end Great Depression in France; *Like many other appeasers on both sides of the Channel, Bonnet believed that German foreign policy was driven by economic grievances, not by Nazi racial theories about Lebensraum, which Bonnet considered farfetched that he felt that the Nazis did not take their ideology seriously. Thus, arrangements to offer Germany greater prosperity would tame German complaints against the existing international order and reduce international tension. *Like other economic experts around the world in the 1930s, Bonnet was disturbed by the implications of the increasing tendency in Germany towards protectionism, currency manipulation, use of \\"blocked accounts\\" for foreign businesses in Germany and foreign holders of German debt, autarky, a growing etatism in the German economy, and the German drive to create their own economic zone in Europe. Bonnet felt that Franco-German economic agreements would at least ensure that France would not be locked out of the German economic sphere of influence and even moderate some of the more worrisome German economic practices. *He wanted a Franco-German friendship that would both banish the prospect of another war, and end the arms race that had placed such a burden on the French economy. However, during the winter of 1938‚Äì1939, negotiations with the Germans proceeded slowly, in large part because the Germans refused to abandon the economic practices that caused such concern. The atmosphere, following the German destruction of Czecho-Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia had been renamed), on 15 March 1939 was not considered conductive for France to be pursuing any sort of agreements with the Germans, and the talks were called off, never to be resumed. At the same time, Bonnet ordered Charles Corbin, the French Ambassador in London to warn Chamberlain and Lord Halifax during their scheduled visit to Rome in January 1939 against any weakening of Anglo-French relations at the expense of improved Anglo- Italian relations. During a meeting between Fran√ßois-Poncet and Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister claimed that the demonstrations were purely \\"spontaneous\\" and did not reflect the views of his government.Duroselle, Jean- Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 324. As part of an effort to gain British support against the Italian campaign, Bonnet issued a statement that France would always rush to Britain's aid in the event of aggression, hoping that his statement might lead to a similar British statement.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 93. In early January 1939, Bonnet and Daladier approved of the idea of sending the banker Paul Baudoin as an unofficial diplomat to find out just what exactly the Italians wanted from France.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 326. The reasoning for the Baudoin mission was if the price of Italian friendship was not too expensive, it might be worth paying as a way of detaching Italy from Germany, thus reducing France's potential enemies. When Baudoin visited Rome in February 1939, he reported that the Italians were asking for only some economic concessions from the French in the Horn of Africa and Italian representation on the board of the Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 326‚Äì327. However, before any decisions were made in Paris about accepting the Italian demands or not, the news of Baudoin's secret visit was leaked to the French press, forcing Bonnet to disavow Baudoin. In response to furious complaints from Fran√ßois-Poncet about Baudoin's mission, which he had first learned about after the story had been leaked, Bonnet replied to Fran√ßois-Poncet: \\"The rumors you are telling me have no basis in fact. You are fully aware that any conversation, any Franco-Italian negotiation official or unofficial could only be handled by you, and that no direct or indirect transaction could not be considered outside your purview\\". In January 1939, negotiations were opened between the French and Turkey over resolving the Hatay dispute.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 364‚Äì365. Leading the French team were Gabriel Puaux, the High Commissioner of Syria and Massigli, the French Ambassador in Ankara.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 365. The continuing feud between Massigli and Bonnet was reflected in Bonnet's habit of refusing Massigli negotiating instructions for weeks on end, thereby placing Massigli in an embarrassing situation when he attempted talks with the Turks. During the talks, Bonnet had first backed Puaux, against any weakening of French control over the Sanjak of Alexandretta before deciding upon settling the dispute in favor of the Turks as a way of potentially winning Turkish support in the event of a war with Germany.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 365‚Äì366. Despite efforts to maintain some sort of French presence in Alexandretta, the Franco-Turkish talks were to end in June 1939, with the Turks being given total control over the disputed region.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 366‚Äì367. By early 1939, it was clear that the days of the Spanish Republic were numbered, and Bonnet felt that it was time for France to recognize the Spanish Nationalists as the legitimate government of Spain (until that time, Paris had recognized the Republican government as the legitimate government).Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 338‚Äì339. On 20 January 1939, Bonnet had a meeting with the former president of Mexico, Francisco Le√≥n de la Barra, who was living in exile in Paris, and asked that de la Barra serve as an unofficial French diplomat in talks with the Spanish Nationalists.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 339. In response to reports from de la Barra that ties between General Francisco Franco and the Axis powers were strained, Bonnet then sent out Senator L√©on B√©rard to sound out the Nationalists about establishing diplomatic relations. Bonnet told B√©rard to inform General Jordana, the Nationalist Foreign Minister that if General Franco was willing to promise that all German and Italian forces were to be withdrawn after the end of the Spanish Civil War, then Paris would recognize the Nationalists. The major dispute during the talks between B√©rard and Jourdana was if the recognition of the Burgos government would be de jure, as Franco wanted, or de facto, as Bonnet wanted and if Franco would promise to remain neutral should a Franco- German war occur.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 340‚Äì341. However. by February 1939, Bonnet believed that the rapid collapse of the Republican war effort made recognition of the Burgos government imperative if France were to have any hope of having influence with General Franco, and on 28 February 1939, France broke diplomatic relations with the Republican government in Madrid and recognized the Nationalist government in Burgos.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 341. Much to the relief of Bonnet, General Franco kept his word about ensuring the withdrawal of Axis forces from Spanish territory, especially the departure of the Italians from the Balearic Islands. In early 1939, the British Embassy in Paris was bombarded with a series of reports that public opinion in France was highly dejected and demoralized, and that unless Britain made the \\"continental commitment\\" (unequivocally linking British security to French security and committing to sending a large British Expeditionary Force to France like the one ultimately sent in World War I), the French would resign themselves to becoming a German satellite state.Young, Robert J. In Command of France French Foreign Policy and Military Planning, 1933‚Äì1940, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, 1978 pages 222‚Äì224 These reports, which secretly originated with the French government, hoped to pressure the British into making the long-sought \\"continental commitment\\".Young, Robert J. In Command of France French Foreign Policy and Military Planning, 1933‚Äì1940, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, 1978 pages 222‚Äì224; Duroselle, Jean- Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 331‚Äì332. The French were assisted in a conspiracy of convenience by the leadership of the British Army, which disliked the funding implications of Chamberlain's \\"limited liability\\" doctrine that held that in the next war, British efforts were to be largely limited to the sea and air, army playing an ancillary role at best. The French effort for a British \\"continental commitment\\" was given a huge and unexpected boost by the \\"Dutch war scare\\" of January 1939. In response to the \\"Dutch war scare\\", which gripped London in late January 1939 when the British government received false reports of an imminent German invasion of the Netherlands, Halifax had Phipps inquire what France would do if such an invasion took place. The Germans were then believed to have planned to overrun the Netherlands and use Dutch airfields to launch a bombing campaign meant to achieve a knockout blow against Britain, and raze British cities to the ground.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 102‚Äì103. The French attitude towards a German invasion of the Netherlands was crucial because France was the only country in Western Europe that possessed an army large enough and modern enough to save the Dutch. Moreover, the importance of France to British security had increased following a violent anti-British propaganda campaign launched in Germany in November 1938, which had led the Chamberlain government to perceive German foreign policy as anti-British. This scare was combined with rumours that Bonnet was secretly attempting to negotiate a Franco-German \\"special relationship\\" that might leave Britain facing a hostile Germany without any allies who possessed the large armies that Britain lacked. In response to Phipps's message, Bonnet had Charles Corbin, the French ambassador in London, inform Lord Halifax that the French attitude towards German aggression towards the Netherlands would depend upon what the British attitude towards France was if the latter were the victim of aggression.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 331‚Äì332. Chamberlain stated to the House of Commons on 6 February 1939 that any German attack on France would automatically be considered an attack on Britain, thereby leading the British to make the \\"continental commitment\\" to send a large army to the defense of France that successive French diplomats had struggled to obtain since 1919. In March 1939, following the German destruction of the rump state of Czechoslovakia and the proclamation of the Reich Protectorate of Bohemia- Moravia, Bonnet had Herv√© Alphand of the Ministry of Commerce, who was in Berlin to negotiate a trade treaty, recalled in protest.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 301. The German move badly damaged Bonnet's creditability, and as part of the aftermath, 17 French intellectuals sent out a letter calling for an inquiry into Bonnet's conduct of foreign affairs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 302. Ties between Daladier and Bonnet were strained when in protest over the German coup, Daladier ordered the recall of Robert Coulondre, the French Ambassador to Germany, without consulting Bonnet, who was much offended by Daladier's act. In April 1939, Bonnet in turn went behind Daladier's back in suggesting for Britain to apply pressure on the French premier to make more concessions to Italy regarding the Franco-Italian disputes over influence in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea regions.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 308. The differences in opinion between Daladier and Bonnet over the question of making concessions to Italy, which Daladier was firmly opposed to, led Daladier increasingly to take control of foreign policy by dealing directly with the Quai d'Orsay's Secretary-General Alexis Saint-Leg√©r L√©ger and pushing Bonnet aside from April 1939 onwards.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 314‚Äì316. In April 1939, Daladier told the Romanian foreign minister Grigore Gafencu \\"he was going to get rid of Bonnet quite shortly\\", and on 6 May, Daladier stated to Bullit he had a great deal of \\"...mistrust of Bonnet and said that he might replace him in the immediate future\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 327. As Count Welczeck noted in May 1939: \\"Bonnet was ...a man who would go to the utmost limits to avoid a European war up to the last moment. He regretted therefore that foreign affairs were so much more in the hands of M. Daladier than M. Bonnet\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 319. During the \\"Romanian war scare\\" of March 1939, when the Romanian government, as part of an effort to enlist British support against German demands for the control of the Romanian oil industry, had the Romanian Minister in London Virgil Tilea make a series of highly misleading statements to the British government to the effect that they were under the verge of an immediate German invasion, Bonnet happened to be in London as part of the company accompanying the state visit of President Albert Lebrun.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 178. The importance of Romania was that Germany possessed no oil of its own and was highly-dependent on oil from the New World (the coal liquefaction plants that were to supply Germany with oil during World War II were not yet in operation). As such, a naval blockade of Germany would have had highly damaging effects on the German economy, and conversely, a German seizure of Romania would undermine the effectiveness of a blockade. When the war scare began on 18 March 1939, Bonnet's first response was to inform the Romanians that they should accept aid from the Soviet Union as there was nothing France could do to save them. The Romanians rejected the French advice while Jakob Suritz, the Soviet Ambassador to France, stated the Soviet Union would take no initiatives in resisting German aggression in Eastern Europe, and France must show the way. During an emergency meeting with Halifax on 20 March, Bonnet sought to shift responsibility to dealing with the crisis onto British shoulders and strongly suggested that the ideal state for saving Romania and its oil was Poland.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 178‚Äì179. Bonnet argued that Britain should take the lead in persuading the Poles to come to Romania's aid and suggested that if Poland were involved, then perhaps the Romanians might be persuaded to accept Soviet aid as well. Bonnet's reasons for arguing that Britain should take the lead in persuading Poland to come to Romania's aid were his fear that if France made such an effort, the price of Polish support would a tightening of the Franco-Polish alliance, which was counter to Bonnet's general policy of seeking to weaken France's eastern alliances. On 23 March 1939, in another meeting with Lord Halifax, Bonnet mentioned that he had received a series of messages from Fran√ßois-Poncet, claiming that it would create a highly negative impression on Mussolini and would hamper efforts to detach him from his alignment with Germany if Britain and France aligned themselves with only the Soviet Union.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 179. Bonnet's statement was to lead the British government into considering the idea of making a \\"guarantee\\" of Polish independence as the best way of securing Polish support for Romania. In this way, Bonnet played a major, if indirect role in the progress leading to the British \\"guarantee\\" of Poland on 31 March 1939. Following the British \\"guarantee\\" of Polish independence on 31 March 1939, followed by the announcements that London wished to build a \\"peace front\\" to resist aggression in April 1939, Bonnet felt there was now a great opportunity of building an Anglo-French-Soviet combination that might deter Germany from war.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 138. On 14 April 1939, Bonnet had a meeting with the Soviet Ambassador to France, Jakob Suritz, and asked \\"in a form to be determined\\" for the Soviet Union to provide military support for Poland and Romania if those nations were attacked by Germany.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 349. Bonnet suggested to Suritz that an Annexe to the Franco-Soviet Pact of 1935 should be added: the Soviet Union would go to war if Germany attacked either Poland or Romania.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 227. In particular, Bonnet stated: \\"It was obvious that there had to be an agreement between the USSR and Romania or the USSR and Poland for the Franco-Soviet Pact to come usefully into play\\". Suritz commented that unless the Poles and Romanians allowed the Red Army transit rights, there was little that the Soviet Union could do for those nations, leading Bonnet to reply that he felt he could pressure both nations into agreeing to provide the desired transit rights. Bonnet commented that he felt it was time to \\"begin immediate discussions between France and the USSR in order to precisely determine the help the USSR could provide to Romania and Poland in the event of German aggression\\". In contrast to his enthusiasm for improving ties with Moscow in the spring of 1939, Bonnet felt the opposite about relations with Warsaw. In May 1939, during talks in Paris with the Poles aimed at strengthening the political and military aspects of the Franco-Polish alliance, Bonnet sabotaged the negotiations by bogging down the talks on the political accord on procedural details, ensuring that no political accord was signed, the precondition for the military accords (not until 3 September 1939 was the political accord finally signed).Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 319‚Äì322. Bonnet's reasons in seeking to block the signing of the Franco-Polish political accord were a way of applying pressure on the Poles to grant the Soviets transit rights, and because in case the negotiations for the \\"grand alliance\\" failed, Bonnet did not wish to see France any more committed to Poland's defense. In June 1939, Bonnet's reputation was badly damaged when the French agent of the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, Otto Abetz, was expelled from France for engaging in espionage, French newspaper editors were charged with receiving bribes from Abetz, and the name of Bonnet's wife was prominently mentioned in connection with the Abetz case as a close friend of the two editors, but despite much lucid speculation in the French press at the time, that no evidence has ever emerged linking Bonnet or his wife to German espionage or bribery.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 332. During the ultimately failed talks for an Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance in the spring and summer of 1939, Bonnet and the rest of the French leadership pressed quite strongly for the revived Triple Entente, often to the considerable discomfort of the British.Young, Robert J. In Command of France, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, United States of America, 1978 pages 236‚Äì237 In the spring and summer of 1939, Bonnet very strongly believed that a \\"grand alliance\\" of the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France would deter Germany from attacking Poland.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 272. At a meeting with Lord Halifax on 20‚Äì21 May 1939 in Geneva, Daladier, Bonnet and Saint-Leg√©r pressured the British Foreign Secretary repeatedly for a \\"grand alliance\\" as the only way of stopping another world war.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 pages 352‚Äì353. In the spring of 1939, Bonnet went so far as to inform Moscow that he supported turning over all of eastern Poland to the Soviet Union regardless of what the Poles felt about the issue if that was to be the price of the Soviet alliance.Imlay, Talbot \\"France and the Phony War, 1939‚Äì1940\\" pages 261‚Äì280 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 edited by Robert Boyce page 264. On 2 June 1939, when the Soviet government offered up its definition of what constituted \\"aggression\\", upon which the intended alliance was to come into play, Bonnet sided with the Soviets against the British, who felt that the Soviet definition of \\"aggression\\", especially \\"indirect aggression\\" was too loose a definition and phrased in such a manner as to imply the Soviet right of inference in the internal affairs of nations of Eastern Europe.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 353. On 1 July 1939, in response to a message from the Soviet Foreign Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov about what nations the intended \\"grand alliance\\" was meant to protect, Bonnet sent a telegraph in reply stating the purpose of the \\"grand alliance\\" was \\"the mutual solidarity of the three great powers... in those conditions the number of countries guaranteed is unimportant\\".Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 355. Besides working for the \\"peace front\\" with Britain and the Soviet Union, Bonnet tried to enlist Turkey in the \\"peace front\\" in July 1939 by arranging for the French and British treasuries to provide financial support to Ankara.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 308‚Äì309. By early July 1939, Bonnet grew increasingly irritated over what he regarded as British foot-dragging in the talks with the Soviets and Polish refusing to grant transit rights to the Red Army.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 356. Bonnet wrote to Lord Halifax at this time stating \\"We are reaching a critical moment, where we find it necessary to do everything possible to succeed\\". As part of an effort to save the talks, Bonnet wrote up and presented, to both London and Moscow, the text of a joint communiqu√© stating to the world their determination to resist aggression and that they \\"agreed on the main points of the political agreement\\". Bonnet's effort was blocked by Molotov, who stated his government had no interest in issuing such a communiqu√©.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 357. In August 1939, Bonnet took up a Turkish effort of mediation between the British and the Soviets as part of an attempt to break the deadlock.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 310. When the Anglo-Franco-Soviet talks were on the verge of breaking down in August 1939 over the issue of transit rights for the Red Army in Poland, Bonnet instructed the French Embassy in Moscow to inform the Kremlin falsely that the Poles had granted the desired transit rights as part of a desperate bid to rescue the alliance talks with the Soviets.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War pages 337‚Äì338. At the same time, immense French diplomatic pressure was applied in Warsaw for the Poles to agree to the transit rights for the Red Army, but the Polish Foreign Minister, J√≥zef Beck was very firm in refusing to consider such an idea. On 19 August 1939, Beck stated in a message to Paris: \\"We have not got a military agreement with the USSR. We do not want to have one\\". The conclusion of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939 left Bonnet highly dejected, believing the prospect of Soviet economic support for Germany would undermine the effectiveness of a British naval blockade of Germany (which was widely assumed in France to be a prerequisite of defeating Germany), and hence his return to advocating renouncing the Polish alliance as the best way of avoiding war for France.Duroselle, Jean-Baptiste France and the Nazi Threat, New York: Enigma Books, 2004 page 272; Imlay, Talbot \\"France and the Phony War, 1939‚Äì1940\\" pages 261‚Äì280 from French Foreign and Defence Policy, 1918‚Äì1940 edited by Robert Boyce pages 265‚Äì267. = August 1939: the Last Months of Peace = After the Non-Aggression Pact, Bonnet urged Daladier that the French should inform the Poles that they should give the Free City of Danzig (modern Gda≈Ñsk, Poland) to Germany, and if the Poles refused, the French should use that refusal as an excuse to renounce the alliance with Poland.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 139. At a cabinet meeting on 22 August 1939, Bonnet spoke against French mobilization and argued that France should seek to find a way to end the alliance with Poland.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 337‚Äì338. Bonnet supported by St. L√©ger-L√©ger and Daladier argued for making one more attempt to win the Soviet alliance.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 467. Reynaud and Mandel both spoke for French mobilization, which Bonnet argued would increase Polish \\"intransigence\\"; Bonnet's comment about mobilization was \\"I do not ask for this\\". At a meeting of the Standing Committee on National Defence, which comprised the Premier, the Ministers of Defence, the Navy, the Air and Foreign Affairs and all of the top French military officials on 23 August 1939, Bonnet sought to pressure General Maurice Gamelin into stating that France could not risk a war in 1939, stating that France should find a way of renouncing the 1921 alliance with Poland.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 339‚Äì341. Bonnet argued that Poland could be saved with only Soviet support, no longer possible because of the Non-Aggression Pact.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 468 Bonnet asserted that oil-rich Romania, helmed in by Germany and the Soviet Union, would now lean towards the totalitarian states and that the Soviets would not allow Turkey to enter the war if Germany attacked a state in the Balkans. At that meeting, Bonnet's arguments for abandoning Poland were countered by General Gamelin, who argued that if war came, there was little France could do for the Poles (whom Gamelin felt could hold out for about three months), but to abandon Poland would be equivalent to abandoning great power status for France.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 140. As Bonnet continued his efforts against going to war for Poland, Daladier increasingly came to feel that appointing Bonnet to the Qui d'Orsay had been a mistake and now consumed with hatred for Bonnet.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 140; Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 544. Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz, the Polish Ambassador to France, accused Bonnet of \\"preparing a new Munich behind our backs\\". On 31 August 1939, Bonnet was the leading spokesman for the idea of using the peace mediation proposals of Benito Mussolini as a pretext for ending the alliance with Poland but was overruled by the French cabinet led by Daladier.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 345‚Äì346. Bonnet together his close ally, the Public Works Minister, Anatole de Monzie, sought to pressure some of the more hesitant hawks in the Cabinet such as Charles Pomaret, Henri Queuille and Jean Zay, into endorsing accepting Mussolini's offer.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 544 At that meeting, Bonnet stated that French should accept the Italian offer and reject the British precondition for acceptance, namely the demobilization of the German Army. Daladier, strongly supported by General Gamelin, argued that Mussolini's proposed peace conference was a trap, and the French should find a reason not to attend Mussolini's proposed conference.Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew The Road to War, London: Macmillan, 1989 page 141. = Final attempts to stop war = When Bonnet first learned of the German attack on Poland at 8:20 a.m., on 1 September 1939, his first reaction was to contact the Italian Ambassador to France, Baron Raffaele Guariglia, and informed him that France had accepted Mussolini's mediation offer.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 545. Bonnet then ordered Fran√ßois-Poncet to see Mussolini about when the peace conference could begin. Bonnet argued very strongly in the cabinet against a French declaration of war and instead urged that the French take up Mussolini's mediation offer; if the Poles refused to attend Mussolini's conference (which was widely expected since Mussolini's revised peace plan on 1 September called for an armistice, not for the removal of German troops from Poland, the major Polish precondition to accepting the Italian plan), the French should denounce the Polish alliance.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 346‚Äì350. Later, that same day, Bonnet ordered the Ambassador in London, Charles Corbin, to tell the British that Mussolini's peace offers had been accepted.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 546. Corbin, in turn, reported that now that war had begun, the British were starting to lose interest in the Italian mediation offer. Likewise, Ambassador L√©on No√´l, in Warsaw, was instructed to see if the Poles would agree to attending Mussolini's proposed conference, only to receive an angry reply from Beck about when France proposed to honor the Franco-Polish alliance by declaring war on Germany. Strong British pressure for a warning to be delivered in Berlin made Bonnet reluctantly order Ambassador Robert Coulondre late on the afternoon of the 1st to warn Ribbentrop that if the Germans continued with their aggression, then France would declare war on Germany.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 549‚Äì550. At midnight on 1 September, Bonnet had Havas issue a statement saying: \\"The French government has today, as have several other Governments, received an Italian proposal looking to the resolution of Europe's difficulties. After due consideration the French government has given a \\"positive response\\"\\".Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 550. On the morning of 2 September, an angry scene occurred at the Quai d'Orsay when the Polish Ambassador Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz marched in unannounced and during a stormy interview with Bonnet demanded to know why France had not declared war yet.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 568‚Äì570. Later that same day, Bonnet during a phone conversation with Count Ciano made a great point of insisting that the French d√©marche of 1 September was not an ultimatum, urging that the Italians start the peace conference as soon as possible.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 572. Though both Bonnet and the Italians were serious about the conference, the proposed conference was blocked when Halifax stated that unless the Germans withdrew from Poland immediately, Britain would not attend. During a phone call to Halifax later on 2 September, Bonnet could not persuade Halifax to drop the precondition about a German withdrawal.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 573‚Äì574. At about 5:00 p.m., Bonnet had another tempestuous interview with ≈Åukasiewicz, who pressed very strongly for a French declaration of war and accused Bonnet of plotting to keep France neutral.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 page 576. As part of an effort to gain British acceptance of the Italian plan, Bonnet sought to see if it were possible for the Germans to stage a \\"symbolic withdrawal\\" from Poland, only to learn from Lord Halifax that a \\"symbolic withdrawal\\" was not acceptable and from Ribbentrop that the Germans had no interest in any sort of peace conference.Watt, D.C. How War Came, London: Heinemann, 1989 pages 583‚Äì585. Bonnet, together with his allies in the \\"peace lobby\\" both within and without the government such as Anatole de Monzie, Jean Mistler, Marcel D√©at, Paul Faure, Paul Baudoin, Pierre Laval, Ren√© Belin, Adrien Marquet, and Gaston Bergery, all spent 1‚Äì3 September lobbying the Daladier government, the Senate and the Chamber against going to war with Germany.Irvine, William \\"Domestic Politics and the Fall of France in 1940\\" pages 85‚Äì99 from The French Defeat of 1940 edited by Joel Blatt, Providence: Berghahn Books 1998 pages 96‚Äì97Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 346‚Äì351. On 3 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany, which had the effect of resolving the debate in Paris and Daladier finally having the French declaration of war issued later that same day. For a week after the war was declared, Daladier avoided having the cabinet meet to ensure that Bonnet would not have a chance to put forward his views about seeking peace with Germany.R√©au, Elisabeth du \\"√âdouard Daladier: The Conduct of the War and the Beginnings of Defeat\\" pages 100‚Äì125 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 106. Bonnet was demoted to minister of justice on 13 September 1939. Later career In the latter half of March 1940, Bonnet together with his \\"peace lobby\\" allies such as Anatole de Monzie, Pierre- √âtienne Flandin, Pierre Laval, Jean Montigny, Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, Georges Scapini, Ren√© Dommanage, Gaston Bergery, Ren√© Chateau, and Ren√© Brunet, made a major lobbying effort to have Laval appointed foreign minister as a prelude to making peace with Germany.Irvine, William \\"Domestic Politics and the Fall of France in 1940\\" pages 85‚Äì99 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 97 Besides chairing meetings of the \\"peace lobby\\", which met six times during the Dr√¥le de guerre, Bonnet otherwise remained silent as Justice Minister.Irvine, William \\"Domestic Politics and the Fall of France in 1940\\" pages 85‚Äì99 from The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments edited by Joel Blatt Berghahn Books: Providence 1998 page 97 On 21 June 1940, Bonnet together with Pierre Laval helped to pressure President Albert Lebrun into changing his mind about leaving for Algeria.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 101. Bonnet supported the Vichy government and served on the National Council from December 1940, but the council never met, and his role in Vichy was small. Bonnet spent most of World War II living on his estate in the Dordogne and attempting to secure himself an office in Vichy, though Bonnet was later to claim to have been involved in the Resistance. According to Gestapo records, Bonnet contacted the Germans once in February 1941 to see if it were possible if the Germans would pressure Laval to include him in the Cabinet and again in June 1943 to reassure them that he had no intention of leaving France to join the Allies. In November 1942, Bonnet agreed, albeit very reluctantly to testify for the prosecution at the planned trial of Herschel Grynszpan.Steinweis, Alan The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti-Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942 pages 471-488 from German Studies Review, Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 481. Bonnet was to testify that his efforts at reaching a rapprochement with the Reich had been sabotaged by the Jews, who were intent on starting a war with Germany, and that Grynszpan had assassinated Ernst von Rath as part of an alleged Jewish conspiracy to push France into war with Germany. However, the trial was never held as Gryszpan's planned defense that he was having a homosexual relationship with Rath, and had shot him as part of a lover's quarrel meant from the German viewpoint the trial was too risky as people might have believed that claim.Steinweis, Alan The Trials of Herschel Grynszpan: Anti- Jewish Policy and German Propaganda, 1938-1942 pages 471-488 from German Studies Review, Volume 31, Issue #3, October 2008 page 484. On 5 April 1944, Bonnet left France for Switzerland, where he was to stay until March 1950.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 101‚Äì102. After the war, proceedings were begun against him but eventually dropped, but he was expelled from the Radical Party in 1944. During his time in exile, Bonnet was to write a five-volume set of memoirs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 101‚Äì103. Bonnet throughout his career had been very much concerned with his reputation, and during his time as Foreign Minister had a team of journalists to engage in what is known in France as Bonnetiste writing, namely a series of books and pamphlets meant to glorify Bonnet as the defender of the peace and Europe's savior.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 400. After leaving the Quai d'Orsay, Bonnet took with him a large number of official papers, which he then used to support the claims made in his voluminous memoirs, where Bonnet depicted himself as waging a singlehanded heroic battle to save the peace.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 398‚Äì401. Many have charged Bonnet with \\"editing\\" his papers to present himself in the best possible light, regardless of the facts. In particular, criticism has centered on some of the contradictory claims in the Bonnet memoirs. At various points, Bonnet claimed it was British pressure that drove France towards Munich in 1938 and that his government wanted to fight for Czechoslovakia. At other times, Bonnet states the military and economic situation in 1938 was such that France could not risk a war that year. In the early 1950s, Bonnet had a debate on the pages of the Times Literary Supplement with one of his leading critics, the British historian Sir Lewis Bernstein Namier over some of the claims contained in his memoirs.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 pages 183‚Äì184 At issue was whether Bonnet had, as Namier charged, snubbed an offer by the Polish foreign minister Colonel J√≥zef Beck in May 1938 to have Poland come to the aid of Czechoslovakia in the event of a German attack. Bonnet denied that such an offer had been made, which led Namier to accuse Bonnet of seeking to falsify the documentary record. Namier was able to establish that Bonnet had been less than honest in his account, and concluded the debate in 1953 with the words: \\"The Polish offer, for what it was worth, was first torpedoed by Bonnet the statesman, and next obliterated by Bonnet the historian\\".Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 184 The real significance of the debate was over Bonnet's freedom of maneuver. In his memoirs, Bonnet claimed that he had been often forced by circumstances beyond his control to carry out a foreign policy that he opposed. Namier charged that Bonnet had other options and was carrying out the same foreign policy that he had wanted to carry out. In 1953, he was allowed to run for office again, and in 1956, Bonnet returned to his old seat in the Dordogne.Adamthwaite, Anthony France and the Coming of the Second World War, London: Frank Cass, 1977 page 102. Readmitted to the Radicals in 1952, he was once again expelled in 1955 for refusing to support Pierre Mend√®s France. Nevertheless, he was once again elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1956 and continued to serve in that body until 1968, when he lost his seat.

Life Barfield was born in London, to Elizabeth (n√©e Shoults; 1860‚Äì1940) and Arthur Edward Barfield (1864‚Äì1938). He had three elder siblings: Diana (1891‚Äì1963), Barbara (1892‚Äì1951), and Harry (1895‚Äì1977). He was educated at Highgate School and Wadham College, Oxford and in 1920 received a first class degree in English language and literature. After finishing his B. Litt., which became his third book Poetic Diction, he was a dedicated poet and author for over ten years. After 1934 his profession was as a solicitor in London, from which he retired in 1959 aged 60. Thereafter he had many guest appointments as Visiting Professor in North America. Barfield published numerous essays, books, and articles. His primary focus was on what he called the \\"evolution of consciousness,\\" which is an idea which occurs frequently in his writings. He is best known as the author of Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry and as a founding father of Anthroposophy in the English speaking world. Family In 1923 he married the musician and choreographer Maud Douie. They had two children, Alexander and Lucy; and fostered Geoffrey. Their sole grandchild is Owen A. Barfield, son of Alexander. The Inklings: C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and Barfield Barfield has been known as \\"the first and last Inkling.\\" He had a profound influence on C. S. Lewis and, through his books The Silver Trumpet and Poetic Diction (dedicated to C.S. Lewis), an appreciable effect on J. R. R. Tolkien.Flieger, \\"Splintered Light\\". Their contribution, and their conversations, persuaded both Tolkien and Lewis that myth and metaphor have always had a central place in language and literature. \\"The Inklings work‚Ä¶ taken as a whole, has a significance that far outweighs any measure of popularity, amounting to a revitalisation of Christian intellectual and imaginative life.\\"C. Gruenler (2015) Mimetic Theory Meets the Oxford Inklings: Girard, Lewis, Tolkien, Williams, and Barfield. The Colloquium on Violence and Religion, July 2015, St Louis University. https://www.academia.edu/15209390/Mimetic_Theory_Meets_the_Oxford_Inklings_Girard_Lewis_Tolkien_Williams_and_Barfield accessed 6 May 2016 Barfield and C. S. Lewis met in 1919 as students at Oxford University and were close friends for 44 years. \\"It is no exaggeration to say that his friendship with Barfield was one of the most important in his [Lewis's] life‚Ä¶\\" The friendship was reciprocal. Almost a year after Lewis's death, Barfield spoke of his friendship in a talk in the USA: \\"Now, whatever he was, and as you know, he was a great many things, CS Lewis was for me, first and foremost, the absolutely unforgettable friend, the friend with whom I was in close touch for over 40 years, the friend you might come to regard hardly as another human being, but almost as a part of the furniture of my existence.‚ÄùColin Duriez (2013) C. S. Lewis: A Biography of Friendship. Lion Books. p 88 When they met, Lewis was an atheist who told Barfield, \\"I don‚Äôt accept God!\\"Duriez, op. cit. Barfield was influential in converting Lewis. Lewis came to see that there were two kinds of friends, a first friend with whom you feel at home and agree (Lewis's close friend Arthur Greeves was an example of this) and a second friend who brings to you a different point of view.The ecclesiastic Ronald Knox was another such friend, see Milton Walsh, Second Friends: C.S. Lewis and Ronald Knox in Conversation. San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2008. 360 pp. . He found Barfield's contribution in this way particularly helpful despite, or because of, the fact that \\"during the 1920s, the two were to engage in a long dispute over Barfield's (and their mutual friend, A.C. Harwood's) connection to anthroposophy and the kind of knowledge that imagination can give us‚Ä¶ which they affectionately called 'The Great War'.Colin Duriez (2013) C. S. Lewis: A Biography of Friendship. Lion Books. pp 87‚Äì88. Through their conversations, Lewis gave up materialist realism ‚Äì the idea that our sensible world is self-explanatory and is all that there is ‚Äì and moved closer to what he had always disparagingly referred to as ‚Äúsupernaturalism.‚ÄùBremer, J. (2011) Clive Staples Lewis (1898‚Äì1963): A Brief Biography. http://instituteofphilosophy.org/c-s-lewis/clive-staples- lewis-1898-1963-a-brief-biography/ First published in The C.S. Lewis Readers‚Äô Encyclopedia in 1998. These conversations influenced Lewis towards writing his Narnia series. As well as being friend and teacher to Lewis, Barfield was (professionally) his legal adviser and trustee. Barfield was an important intellectual influence on Lewis, who dedicated his 1936 book Allegory of Love to Barfield. Lewis wrote his 1949 book The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the first Narnia chronicle, for his friend's adopted daughter Lucy Barfield and dedicated it to her. He also dedicated The Voyage of the Dawn Treader to Barfield's son Geoffrey in 1952. Barfield also influenced his scholarship and world view. He dedicated his first scholarly book, The Allegory of Love (1936) to his 'wisest and best of my unofficial teachers,' stating in its preface that he asked no more than to disseminate Barfield's literary theory and practice. Barfield's more than merely intellectual approach to philosophy is illustrated by a well-known interchange that took place between himself and Lewis, which Lewis did not forget. Lewis one day made the mistake of referring to philosophy as \\"a subject.\\" \\"It wasn't a subject to Plato,\\" said Barfield, \\"it was a way,\\".C.S. Lewis, \\"Surprised by Joy\\", p. 225. In the third lecture of The Abolition of Man (1947), Lewis suggests that Barfield's mentor, Rudolf Steiner, may have found the way to a 'redeemed scientific method that does not omit the qualities of the observed object'. Barfield was also an important influence on Tolkien. In a letter to C. A. Furth of Allen and Unwin in 1937, Tolkien wrote, \\"the only philological remark (I think) in The Hobbit is...: an odd mythological way of referring to linguistic philosophy, and a point that will (happily) be missed by any who have not read Barfield (few have), and probably by those who have.\\"Letters, 22 The reference in question comes when Bilbo visits the dragon Smaug's treasure hoard within the Lonely Mountain: \\"To say that Bilbo's breath was taken away is no description at all. There are no words left to express his staggerment, since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all was wonderful. Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before, but the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment...\\" Lewis wrote to Barfield in around 1928 about his influence on Tolkien: \\"You might like to know that when Tolkien dined with me the other night he said, apropos of something quite different, that your conception of the ancient semantic unity had modified his whole outlook, and he was always just going to say something in a lecture when your concept stopped him in time. 'It is one of those things,' he said, 'that when you have once seen it there are all sorts of things you never say again.\\"Carpenter, Inklings, 42 Barfield's notion of final participation (the idea of a fully conscious participative unity with nature) brought to the Inklings ideas similar to those later expounded by others as Radical Orthodoxy, with its long theological history. It has roots in the Platonic idea of methexis passed on by Augustine and Aquinas and offered a sacramental view of reality, which Tolkien takes up in the Ring, in for example the contemplative artistry and natural oneness of the elves, Tom Bombadil and the hobbits‚Äô simple pleasures.Gruenler, op. cit. Anthroposophy Barfield became an anthroposophist after attending a lecture by Rudolf Steiner in 1924.Blaxland- De Lange, p. 27. He studied the work and philosophy of Rudolf Steiner throughout his life, translated some of his works, and had some of his own early essays published in anthroposophical publications. This part of Barfield's literary work includes the book The Case for Anthroposophy containing his Introduction to selected extracts from Steiner's Riddles of the Soul.The Case for Anthroposophy. Publishing information: Online Steiner is always a formulating presence in Barfield's work, probably his major influenceGrant, pp. 113‚Äì125 but Barfield's thought should not be considered merely derivative of Steiner's. Barfield expert G. B. Tennyson suggests that: \\"Barfield is to Steiner as Steiner was to Goethe\\",Tennyson, \\"Owen Barfield: Man and Meaning\\". which is illuminating so long as it isn't taken as referring to relative stature. Barfield's writing was not derivative, it was profoundly original, but he did not see himself as having moved beyond Steiner, as, in his opinion, Steiner had moved beyond Goethe. Barfield considered Steiner a much greater man in possession of a greater mind than Goethe, and of course he considered himself very small indeed compared to both of them. Influence and opinions Barfield might be characterised as both a Christian writer and a learned anti-reductionist writer. His books have been republished by Barfield UK, with new editions including Unancestral Voice; History, Guilt, and Habit; Romanticism Comes of Age; The Rediscovery of Meaning; Speaker's Meaning; and Worlds Apart. History in English Words seeks to retell the history of Western civilisation by exploring the change in meanings of various words. Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry is on the 1999 100 Best Spiritual Books of the Century list by Philip Zaleski. Barfield was also an influence on T. S. Eliot who called Barfield's book Worlds Apart \\"a journey into seas of thought very far from ordinary routes of intellectual shipping.\\" In her book Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien's World, Verlyn Flieger analyses the influence of Barfield's Poetic Diction on the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien.Flieger More recent discussions of Barfield's work are published in Stephen Talbott's The Future Does Not Compute: Transcending the Machines in Our Midst, Neil Evernden's The Social Creation of Nature, Daniel Smitherman's Philosophy and the Evolution of Consciousness, Morris Berman's The Reenchantment of the World, and Gary Lachman's A Secret History of Consciousness. In 1996 Lachman conducted perhaps the last interview with Barfield, versions of which appeared in GnosisLachman, \\"One Man's Century\\", Gnosis (Vol. 40, 1996) p. 8. magazine and the magazine Lapis.Lachman, \\"Owen Barfield\\" Lapis (Issue 3, 1996). In his book Why the World Around You isn't as it Appears: A Study of Owen Barfield (SteinerBooks, 2012), Albert Linderman presents Barfield's work in light of recent societal examples and scholarship while writing for an audience less familiar with philosophical categories and history. In a foreword to Poetic Diction, Howard Nemerov, US Poet Laureate, stated: Among the poets and teachers of my acquaintance who know POETIC DICTION it has been valued not only as a secret book, but nearly as a sacred one.\\"Poetic Diction\\", p. 1. Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning novelist, wrote: \\"We are well supplied with interesting writers, but Owen Barfield is not content to be merely interesting. His ambition is to set us free. Free from what? From the prison we have made for ourselves by our ways of knowing, our limited and false habits of thought, our 'common sense'.\\" Bellow, \\"History, Guilt and Habit: Editorial review\\". The culture critic and psychologist James Hillman called Barfield \\"one of the most neglected important thinkers of the 20th Century\\".Lavery, \\"Interview with James Hillman\\". Harold Bloom, describing Poetic Diction, referred to it as \\"a wonderful book, from which I keep learning a great deal\\". The film Owen Barfield: Man and Meaning (1994), co-produced and written by G. B. Tennyson and David Lavery, directed and edited by Ben Levin, is a documentary portrait of Barfield. Barfield has been held in high esteem by many contemporary poets, including Robert Kelly, Charles Stein, George Quasha, Tom Cheetham, and others. =Poetic Diction= Barfield's book Poetic Diction begins with examples of \\"felt changes\\" arising in reading poetry, and discusses how these relate to general principles of poetic composition. But his greater agenda is \\"the study of meaning\\". Using poetic examples, he sets out to demonstrate how the imagination works with words and metaphors to create meaning. He shows how the imagination of the poet creates new meaning, and how this same process has been active, throughout human experience, to create and continuously expand language. For Barfield this is not just literary criticism: it is evidence bearing on the evolution of human consciousness. This, for many readers, is his real accomplishment: his unique presentation of \\"not merely a theory of poetic diction, but a theory of poetry, and not merely a theory of poetry, but a theory of knowledge\\". This theory was developed directly from a close study of the evolution of words and meaning, starting with the relation between the primitive mind's myth making capacity, and the formation of words. Barfield uses numerous examples to demonstrate that words originally had a unified \\"concrete and undivided\\" meaning, which we now distinguish as several distinct concepts. For example, he points out that the single Greek word pneuma (which can be variously translated as \\"breath\\", \\"spirit\\", or \\"wind\\") reflects the original unity of these concepts of air, spirit, wind, and breath, all included in one \\"holophrase\\". This Barfield considers to be not the application of a poetic analogy to natural phenomena, but the discernment of an actual phenomenal unity. Not only concepts, but the phenomena themselves, form a unity, the perception of which was possible to primitive consciousness and therefore reflected in language. This is the perspective Barfield believes to have been primordial in the evolution of consciousness, the perspective which was \\"fighting for its life\\", as he phrases it, in the philosophy of Plato, and which, in a regenerate and more sophisticated form, benefiting from the development of rational thought, needs to be recovered if consciousness is to continue to evolve. =Worlds Apart= Worlds Apart is one of Barfield's most brilliant performances. It is a fictional dialogue between a physicist, a biologist, a psychiatrist, a lawyer-philologist (who might be taken for Barfield himself), a linguistic analyst (more or less the villain), a theologian (who has reminded some readers of C. S. Lewis), a retired Waldorf School teacher, and a young man employed at a rocket research station. During a period of three days, the characters discuss and debate first principles, occasioned at first by the observation that the various branches of modern thought seem to be taking for granted an incompatibility with one another. The discussion culminates in a crescendo of some length from the retired teacher, who expounds the anthroposophical point of view.https://www.amazon.com/Worlds- Apart-A- Dialogue-1960s/dp/0955958261/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1367048708&sr;=8-1&keywords;=worlds+apart%2C+owen+barfield =Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry= Saving the Appearances explores the development of human consciousness across some three thousand years of history. Barfield argues that the evolution of nature is inseparable from the evolution of consciousness. What we call matter interacts with mind and wouldn't exist without it. In Barfield's lexicon, there is an \\"unrepresented\\" underlying base of reality that is extra-mental. This is comparable to Kant's notion of the \\"noumenal world\\".\\"Encyclopedia Barfieldiana: The Unrepresented\\" (entry). However, unlike Kant, Barfield entertained the idea that the \\"unrepresented\\" could be directly experienced, under some conditions. Similar conclusions have been made by others, and the book has influenced, for example, the physicist Stephen Edelglass (who wrote The Marriage of Sense and Thought), and the Christian existentialist philosopher Gabriel Marcel, who wanted the book to be translated into French.Remark of Barfield, quoted in Sugerman, ed., Evolution of Consciousness, p. 20. Barfield points out that the \\"real\\" world of physics and particles is completely different from the world we see and live in of things with properties. The particle world of physics is independent of human thought, and only indirectly accessible to humans. The world we see and perceive directly is dependent on and alterable by human thought (this is not to say there aren't or are limits.) Both are 'real' or 'unreal' depending on the meaning of real; that this changes over time in human thought is exactly Barfield's point.

Hubert V√©drine has been one of the longest-serving aid to a President of France, working closely with President Mitterrand for 14 years from 1981 to 1995. V√©drine served first as President Mitterrand's diplomatic advisor (French equivalent of the National Security Advisor) from 1981 to 1988, then as President Mitterrand's spokesperson from 1988 to 1991, and finally as Secretary-General of the French presidency (equivalent of the White House Chief of Staff) from 1991 to 1995. He then served as Foreign Minister of France from 1997 to 2002 in the government of Lionel Jospin. After the reelection of Jacques Chirac in May 2002, V√©drine was replaced by Dominique de Villepin. All three men were characterised by their strong opposition to unilateral action by the United States in Iraq. V√©drine popularized the neologism hyperpower to describe what he saw as the historically unparalleled influence and might held by the United States at the turn of the century.

In 2005, he was appointed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a member of the High Council for the Alliance of Civilizations, an initiative that seeks to galvanize international action against extremism through intercultural and interreligious dialogue and cooperation. He took part in 2007 on the committee preparing the Paris Conference on the Environment to lay the foundations for a future United Nations Environment Organization.

Five months later, he replaced Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson. He remained in this function until the Socialist defeat in the March 1986 legislative election. Nevertheless, he returned to the Quai d'Orsay after the re-election of Mitterrand in May 1988, until the PS defeat in the March 1993 legislative elections. Indeed, he was the French Foreign Minister during the collapse of the Soviet Block, the Gulf War, and the negotiations of the Maastricht Treaty. Not re-elected to the French National Assembly in 1993, he was nominated President of the Constitutional Council in 1995. This was one of the last decisions of President Mitterrand. Under his presidency, the body argued in favour of complete judicial immunity for the French President. M.

The cartoon features Bosko, and the title is a pun on the 1929 song Singin' in the Bathtub. The name of the Looney Tunes series bears an obvious debt to the Walt Disney Animation Studios' Silly Symphony series, which began in 1929. Steve Schneider writes that this \\"immediately reveals Harman and Ising's belief that the only way to compete ‚Äî or even to survive ‚Äî in the cartoon trade was to cleave to the Disney version.\\" Made in 1930, this short marked the theatrical debut of Bosko the \\"Talk-Ink Kid\\" whom Harman and Ising had created to show to Warner Brothers. Bosko became their first star character, surpassed only much later by Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. Notably, this is the only publicly released Bosko short to feature Bosko's original blackface dialect provided by animator Carman Maxwell; he would later adopt a more falsetto voice for later films. The short was produced, directed, supervised and co-animated by Harman and Ising, with animation by a very young Friz Freleng and his friends. Leon Schlesinger was credited as an associate producer, and the title card also gave credit to the Western Electric apparatus used to create the film.  Plot synopsis  Bosko plays the shower spray as a harp The film opens with Bosko taking a bath while whistling \\"Singin' in the Bathtub\\". A series of gags allows him to play the shower spray like a harp, pull up his pants by tugging his hair, and give the limelight to the bathtub itself which stands on its hind feet to perform a dance. (There is a clear shot of a toilet during this scene, and the bathtub tears off sheets of toilet paper during its dance, permissible only in the pre-Hays Code days.) Once he finds his car, which had left the garage to use the outhouse, Bosko goes to visit his girlfriend Honey, who is showering in front of an open window. \\"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\\" plays in the background. A goat eats the flowers he brought, so he serenades her to get her to come out. A saxophone full of bubbles (caused when she dumps a bathtub full of soapy water into Bosko's saxophone due to his butchering of \\"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\\") provide a floating cascade of steps for her as she alights from the balcony. \\"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\\" accompanies this action. Their country drive presents grave perils for Bosko, with the first obstacle being a stubborn grazing cow. After the cow is pushed out of the way, the indignant cow walks away to the tune of Elgar's \\"Pomp and Circumstance Marches\\". The drive continues as the car is at first resistant to go up a steep hill, then speeds out of control while Bosko collides into various objects that create the sounds of ascending and descending C major scales. (Bosko exclaims \\"mammy\\" in the original version during this portion of the film.) The sequence ends with the car plunging over a cliff into a lake. Always able to adapt, Bosko continues their date as a boating trip and plays the last refrain (a reprise of \\"Singin' in the Bathtub\\") using lilypads as a marimba. The cartoon ends with Bosko saying the classic line \\"That's all Folks!\\" Production This cartoon was first theatrically released with the lost Warner Bros./Vitaphone Technicolor film Song of the Flame. This is the first publicly released non-Disney cartoon to have a pre-recorded soundtrack (in addition, \\"Bosko, the Talk-Ink Kid\\" had a pre-synched track.) Some of the animation by Hugh Harman and Rudy Ising was lifted from some of the Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons they made a couple of years earlier. Release A clip of the cartoon was seen on a 1990 episode of Pee-Wee's Playhouse. It exists in its entirety on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3 box set.

Native to the New World, the species are known as blue-eyed grasses and, though not true grasses and in varieties with flower colors other than blue, are monocots.http://www.southeasternflora.com/view_flora.php?plantid=304 Several species in the eastern United States are threatened or endangered. Description Sisyrinchium angustifolium Sisyrinchium californicum Sisyrinchium albidum These are not true grasses, but many species have the general appearance of grasses, as they are low-growing plants with long, thin leaves. They often grow on grasslands. Many species resemble irises, to which they are more closely related. Most species grow as perennial plants, from a rhizome, though some are short-lived (e.g. S. striatum), and some are annuals (e.g. S. iridifolium). The flowers are relatively simple and often grow in clusters. Many species, particularly the South American ones, are not blue, despite the common name. The genus includes species with blue, white, yellow, and purple petals, often with a contrasting centre. Of the species in the United States, the Western Blue-eyed Grass, Sisyrinchium bellum, is sometimes found with white flowers, while the California Golden-eyed Grass, Sisyrinchium californicum, has yellow flowers. Taxonomy The genus was named by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, based on the species Sisyrinchium bermudiana (commonly called Bermudiana). Sisyrinch√≠on is the Greek word, recorded by Pliny and Theophrastus, for the Barbary nut iris (Iris or Moraea sisyrinchium), and refers to the way the corm tunics resemble a shaggy goat's-hair coat, sis√Ωra., Authors as early as 1666Ambrosini, Giacinto. 1666. Phytologiae give the dubious etymology of Latin s≈´s \\"pig\\" and Greek rhynchos \\"nose\\", referring to pigs grubbing the roots. As Goldblatt and Manning explain, \\"the reason for applying the name to a genus of New World Iridaceae was apparently arbitrary.\\" The taxonomy of this genus is rather perplexing and confusing, as several of these species, such as Sisyrinchium angustifolium, form complexes with many variants named as species. More genetic research and cladistic analysis need to be performed to sort out the relationships between the species. Some species, notably S. douglasii, have been transferred to the separate genus Olsynium. =Selected species= There are up to 200 species,Search for \\"Sisyrinchium\\", including: { - valign=\\"top\\"  * Sisyrinchium albidum Raf. * Sisyrinchium angustifolium Mill. ‚Äì narrow-leaf blue-eyed-grass * Sisyrinchium bellum S.Watson ‚Äì western blue-eyed grass or Californian blue-eyed grass * Sisyrinchium bermudiana ‚Äì bermudiana * Sisyrinchium californicum ‚Äì golden blue-eyed grass, yellow-eyed-grass, and golden-eyed-grass * Sisyrinchium campestre Bickn. * Sisyrinchium dichotomum ‚Äì wishbone blue-eyed grass, white irisette, and reflexed blue-eyed grass * Sisyrinchium elmeri ‚Äì Elmer's blue- eyed grass * Sisyrinchium funereum ‚Äì Funeral Mountain blue-eyed grass and Death Valley blue-eyed-grass * Sisyrinchium halophilum ‚Äì Nevada blue-eyed grass * Sisyrinchium idahoense Bickn. ‚Äì Idaho blue-eyed grass * Sisyrinchium longipes ‚Äì timberland blue-eyed grass * Sisyrinchium micranthum ‚Äì blue pigroot or striped rush-leaf * Sisyrinchium montanum Greene ‚Äì strict blue-eyed grass, American blue-eyed-grass * Sisyrinchium platense I.M.Johnst * Sisyrinchium pruinosum ‚Äì spotted blue-eyed grass or dotted blue-eyed grass * Sisyrinchium rosulatum - white Blue-Eyed Grass Flower with maroon center, found in East Texas * Sisyrinchium sarmentosum ‚Äì mountain blue-eyed grass and pale blue- eyed-grass * Sisyrinchium septentrionale ‚Äì northern blue-eyed grass * Sisyrinchium striatum ‚Äì pale yellow-eyed-grass or satin flower } Gallery Image:Sisyrinchium-campestre.jpgPrairie blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium campestre) Image:Sisyrinchium-montanum.jpgStrict blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium montanum var. montanum) Image:Sisyrinchium- mucronatum.jpgNeedletip blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium mucronatum) Image:Sisyrinchium-fuscatum.jpgCoastalplain blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium fuscatum) References *Rudall, P.

Marshall (September 13, 1921 ‚Äì March 26, 2019) was an American foreign policy strategist who served as director of the United States Department of Defense's Office of Net Assessment from 1973 to 2015. Appointed to the position by President Richard Nixon, Marshall remained in office during all successive administrations that followed until his retirement on January 2, 2015. He was succeeded in the role by James H. Baker. Biography Raised in Detroit, Michigan, Marshall pursued autodidactic interests in history, literature and the natural and social sciences from a young age. He graduated from Cass Technical High School (where he trained in machining and received the second-highest score on a citywide aptitude test for honors students similar in provenance to the SAT) in 1939. After briefly working in a factory and attending the University of Detroit for a year, he dropped out to take a position at the Murray Body Company, where he manufactured machine tools used in fabricating British airplane parts. Unable to serve in World War II due to a heart murmur, Marshall continued to work at Murray for the remainder of the war. He eventually resumed his formal studies at Wayne State University in 1943. Marshall was admitted to the University of Chicago with graduate standing in 1945; under the chancellery of Robert Maynard Hutchins, students who were not enrolled in the generalist \\"Chicago Plan\\" undergraduate program pursued a course of study that led to a master's degree instead of the baccalaureate. Strongly influenced by Friedrich Hayek, he earned an M.A. in economics from the institution in 1949. His master's thesis was a sensitivity analysis of Lawrence Klein's econometric model of the US economy; influential for its methodology, it has never been published except for a short abstract. After electing to defer his studies in favor of eventually pursuing a Ph.D. in statistics (a program not yet offered by the University of Chicago), Marshall joined the RAND Corporation, the original \\"think tank,\\" at the behest of mentor W. Allen Wallis in 1949. While he would briefly return to academia to cover Wallis's courses during the 1953-1954 term and continued to take statistics courses at George Washington University, Marshall soon gained the cachet of being part of \\"a cadre of strategic thinkers\\" that coalesced at the RAND Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s, a group that also included Charles J. Hitch, Herman Kahn, James Schlesinger and Daniel Ellsberg. Notably, he worked with Kahn on developing and advancing Monte Carlo methods. Schlesinger would later become the U.S. Secretary of Defense and personally oversaw the creation of the Office of Net Assessment. The original main task of the office was to provide strategic evaluations on nuclear war issues. James Roche, Secretary of the Air Force in the administration of George W. Bush, worked for Marshall during the 1970s.Lehman, Nicholas. \\"Dreaming About War.\\" The New Yorker, July 16, 2001. Andrew Marshall was consulted for the 1992 draft of Defense Planning Guidance (DPG), created by then-Defense Department staffers I. Lewis Libby, Paul Wolfowitz, and Zalmay Khalilzad; all of whom took to influential roles in the administration of George W. Bush. Marshall has been noted for fostering talent in younger associates, who then proceed to influential positions in and out of the federal government: \\"a slew of Marshall's former staffers have gone on to industry, academia and military think tanks.\\"Silverstein, Ken. \\"The Man from ONA.\\" The Nation, October 25, 1999. Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz, among others, have been cited as Marshall \\"star prot√©g√©s.\\" In 2003, Marshall commissioned a report for the Pentagon predicting that abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The report, authored by Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall, predicted that 'catastrophic' shortages of water and energy supply would become increasingly harder to overcome, plunging the planet into war by 2020. Schwarz and Randall further claimed that major European cities would be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a 'Siberian' climate by 2020. At the time of the report's publishing, it became notable for its link to Marshall and its accusations that leadership of the Pentagon purportedly \\"covered up\\" the report for four months until it was obtained by the British weekly The Observer. In an interview in 2012, Major General Chen Zhou, the main author of four Chinese defence white papers, stated that Marshall was one of the most important figures in changing Chinese defence thinking in the 1990s and 2000s. Andrew Marshall funded and published three best selling books by Michael Pillsbury: Chinese Views of Future Warfare in 1998, China Debates the Future Security Environment, and in 2015 an international bestseller, The Hundred- Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America. According to a biography, The Last Warrior: Andrew Marshall and the Shaping of Modern American Defense Strategy, \\"There was every reason for Marshall to expect that Chinese modes of thought would be even more alien to American ways of thinking than the Soviet leadership's had been, and that some insight into the thinking of China's political and military leaders could be gleaned from surveying open source writings. Pillsbury's work on China, which Marshall had encouraged and supported since the early 1970s, illustrates both points.\\" According to The New York Times March 26, 2019 obituary of Marshall, \\"His gift was the framing of the question, the discovery of the critical question,\\" said Michael Pillsbury, a China expert who advised and worked with Mr. Marshall throughout his career.\\" The Washington Post obituary about Marshall stated, \\"He had an uncanny ability to pick out only the most significant questions, then to drill down deeply,\\" Pillsbury, a colleague of 45 years, said in an interview. \\"He developed an iconoclastic, contrarian image.\\" Foreign Policy named Marshall one of its 2012 Top 100 Global Thinkers, \\"for thinking way, way outside the Pentagon box\\". Death Marshall died on March 26, 2019 in Arlington, Virginia, at the age of 97. House Armed Services Committee ranking member Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) announced his death during a hearing, saying, \\"I can think of fewer people who have had a bigger impact of focusing our defense efforts, our national security, in the right direction than Mr. Marshall. He has been before our committee I don‚Äôt know how many times over the years. So I wanted to note that passing, but also to honor his memory because he made such a difference.\\" References Further reading * Andrew F. Krepinevich, Barry D. Watts.

Article 15 of the Constitution of Lithuania, approved by national referendum in 1992, stipulates, \\"The Coat of Arms of the State shall be a white Vytis on a red field\\". The heraldic shield features the field gules (red) with an armoured knight on a horse salient argent (silver). The knight is holding in his dexter hand a sword argent above his head. A shield azure hangs on the sinister shoulder of the knight with a double cross/two-barred cross or (gold) on it. The horse saddle, straps, and belts are azure. The hilt of the sword and the fastening of the sheath, the stirrups, the curb bits of the bridle, the horseshoes, as well as the decoration of the harness, are or (gold). The blazon is the following: Gules, a knight armed cap-√†-pie mounted on a horse salient argent, brandishing a sword proper and maintaining a shield azure charged with a cross of Lorraine Or.  Grand Duchy of Lithuania  The knight on horseback without a specific name was mentioned in the Tobolsk Chronicle as a symbol of Narimantas. The charging knight is depicted on the seal of Grand Duke of Lithuania Algirdas, dated 1366. The earliest coins featuring the knight come from the last quarter of the 14th century; the other side of these coins depicts the Columns of Gediminas. The emblem was handed down through the generations, from Algirdas to his son, Grand Duke Jogaila, then to Jogaila's cousin Grand Duke Vytautas and others. In the 14th century, the knight was featured on a heraldic shield, first on Jogaila's seal in 1386 or 1387, and also on the seal of Vytautas in 1401. At the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, the major victory of the united Polish‚ÄìLithuanian army against the Teutonic Order, thirty Lithuanian regiments out of the total forty were flying the \\"charging knight\\" banner. At first, the charging knight was depicted riding to left or right, and holding a lance instead of the sword. Two seals of Lengvenis of 1385 and of 1388 exhibit this change. The peculiarities of the earliest Lithuanian coins The lance was more often exhibited on the seals of Skirgaila and Kaributas. By the first half of the 15th century, the rider is always shown riding to the left (as seen by the viewer) with a sword in his raised hand and a shield in the left hand (if he rode to the right, the shield would be concealed by the rider). During the 15th century, the colors of the seal became uniform: a white (silver) charging knight holding a sword and a shield on a red field. = Use as a state symbol = By the 15th century, the heraldic knight became representative of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and of its central part, the Duchy of Vilnius. Its name Pogonia is first recorded in the Statutes of Lithuania of 1588. In the 16th century, the knight's shield was depicted as blue with a gold double cross, constructed in such a way that all six ends are equal in length. The double-cross was attributed to Jogaila, who was said to have adopted it after his baptism as Ladislaus and marriage with a Hungarian princess and King of Poland Hedvig Angevin in 1386. It is derived from the Hungarian cross, the assumed coat of arms of Saint Ladislaus, King of Hungary, which is, in turn, a derivative of the Patriarchal cross. The Renaissance introduced minor stylistic changes and variations: long feathers waving from the tip of the knight's helm, a long saddle-cloth, the horsetail turned upwards and shaped as nosegay. With these changes, the coat of arms remained the State symbol of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until 1795, when Lithuania was annexed to the Russian Empire.

A notable later change was the replacement of the double-cross with the red Byzantine cross on the knight's shield. At first, the charging knight was interpreted as the ruler of the country. As time passed, he became a knight who is chasing intruders out of his native country. Such an interpretation was especially popular in the 19th century, and the first half of the 20th century, when Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire and sought its independence. Following the partition of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, most of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was absorbed by the Russian Empire and the Vytis was incorporated into the imperial state emblem. The Vytis was the coat of arms of the Vilna Governorate following the incorporation of Vilnius and surrounding lands into the Russian Empire. Statues of the Vytis placed on white columns greeted visitors at the entrances to Vilnius from 1818 until 1840, when the statues were replaced with two-headed eagles ‚Äì the state symbol of the Russian Empire. Uprisings to restore the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth like the 1830-31 November Uprising and 1863-64 January Uprising saw the Vytis used as a symbol of rebellion against the Russian Empire. File:Vilnius COA 1845.pngthumb150 pxCoat of arms of Vilna Governorate (1845) File:Coat of arms of Governorate of Vilna.svgVilna Governorate coat of arms  Republic of Lithuania in the Interwar  When Lithuania restored its independence in 1918-1920, several artists produced updated versions of the coat of arms. Almost all included a scabbard, which is not found in its earliest historic versions. A romanticized version by Antanas ≈Ωemaitis became the most popular. The horse appeared to be flying through the air (courant). The gear was very ornate. For example, the saddle blanket was very long and divided into three parts. There was no uniform or official version of the coat of arms. To address popular complaints, in 1929 a special commission was set up to analyze the best 16th century specimens of Vytis to design an official state emblem. Mstislav Dobuzhinsky was the chief artist. The commission worked for 5 years, but its version was never officially confirmed. Meanwhile, a design by Juozas Zikaras was introduced for official use on Lithuanian coins. The Vytis was the state emblem of the Republic of Lithuania until 1940 when the Republic was annexed by the Soviet Union and national symbols were suppressed. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Vytis, together with the Columns of Gediminas and the national flag, became symbols of the independence movement in Lithuania. In 1988, Lithuania's Soviet authorities legalised the public display of the Vytis.

On March 20, 1990 the Supreme Council of Lithuania approved the description of the State's coat of arms and determined the principal regulations for its use. The design was based on Juozas Zikaras' version. This was to demonstrate that Lithuania was resuming the traditions of the state that existed between 1918-1940\\\\. On September 4, 1991, a new design by Arvydas Ka≈ædailis was approved based on the recommendations of a special heraldic committee. It abandoned romantic interwar interpretations, harkening back to the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It re-established the original colors, but placed the horse and rider in an ostensibly more \\"defensive\\" posture, airs above the ground rather than leaping forward and sword simply elevated rather than poised to strike. However, Lithuanian coins featured Zikaras' design until they were replaced by the euro in 2015. In 2004, Lithuania's Seimas confirmed a new variant of the Vytis on the historical flag of Lithuania. It is depicted on a rectangular red fabric, recalling the old battle flags of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The flag does not replace the yellow-green-red tri-color national flag of Lithuania. It is used on special occasions, anniversaries, and buildings of historic significance. It is currently proposed that a larger version of the coat of arms be adopted. It would feature a line from \\"Tauti≈°ka giesmƒó\\", the national anthem of Lithuania, \\"Vienybƒó te≈æydi\\" (\\"May unity blossom\\"). The Seimas already uses a larger version of the coat of arms with this phrase as its motto, along with two supporters: the dexter one a griffin argent beaked and membered or, langued gules, and the sinister one a unicorn argent, armed and unguled or, langued gules, and the ducal hat on top of the shield. The President of Lithuania uses the shield and supporters only. Lithuania joined the Eurozone by adopting the euro on 1 January 2015.http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/splash/?requested=%2fhomepage%2fhighlights%2flithuania- adopts-the-euro%2f%3flang%3den The designs of Lithuanian euro coins share a similar national side for all denominations, featuring the Vytis and the name of the country, \\"Lietuva\\". The design was announced on 11 November 2004 following a public opinion poll conducted by the Bank of Lithuania. The horse is again leaping forward, as in more traditional versions.

Kazimieras-a.pngthumb150pxLitas commemorative coin featuring a historical Vytis.  Interpretations  Jonas Trink≈´nas, the leader of a neo-pagan movement Romuva, believes that in the Lithuanian mythology Vytis represents Perk≈´nas, a god of thunder.Lithuanian National Coat of Arms It is believed that the Vytis may represent Perk≈´nas as supreme god or Kovas who was also a war god and has been depicted as a horseman since ancient times. Gintaras Beresneviƒçius also points out that a white horse had a sacral meaning to Balts. These interpretations coincide with one of the interpretations of the German coat of arms, that suggests an adler being the bird of Odin, a god of war, which is commonly depicted as a horserider.  Origins of the word Vytis  It is unknown for certain what Lithuania's coat of arms was initially called; Edmundas Rim≈°a claims that the Ruthenian word Pogonia was used for it for the first time in the 16th century.Rim≈°a, Edmundas (2005), p.121 The earliest known Lithuanian name for the coat of arms is a 17th-century translation of Pogonia by Konstantinas Sirvydas as Waikimas (\\"Vaikymas\\" in the modern Lithuanian orthography), which was used until the 19th century together with Pagaunia.Lietuvi≈°koje XVIIIa. pabaigos ‚Äì XIXa. literat≈´roje valstybƒós herbas, galima sakyti, vadintas tik Vaikymu, kuris neabejotinai yra lenki≈°kojo Pogonia atitikmuo The origins of the Lithuanian proper noun Vytis are not clear either. At the dawn of the Lithuanian National Revival, Simonas Daukantas employed the term wytis, referring to the crest in this way for the first time in his historical piece BudƒÖ Senowƒôs Lietuwi√ª kalneniu ir ≈ªemaiti√ª, published in 1846. The etymology of this particular name is not universally accepted; it is either a direct translation of the Polish Pogo≈Ñ, a common noun constructed from the Lithuanian verb vyti (\\"to chase\\"), or, less likely, a derivative from the East Slavic title of the knight, vytiaz'. The first presumption, raised by the linguist Pranas Skard≈æius in 1937, is challenged by some, since Pogo≈Ñ does not actually mean \\"chasing (knight)\\". In support of the second proposal, the Lithuanian language has words with the stem -vyt in such personal names as Vytenis; furthermore, vytis has a structure common to words constructed from verbs.Jonas Palionis. Kieno sukurtas Lietuvos herbas (Vytis). Literat≈´ra ir menas, 2002 In 1884, Mikalojus Akelaitis coined the Lithuanian name Vytis for the coat of arms in the newspaper Auszra.≈†iandien visiem gerai ≈æinomƒÖ vyƒçio terminƒÖ XIXa. viduryje, tiesa, ne herbui, bet raiteliui (riteriui) apib≈´dinti pirmasis panaudojo Simonas Daukantas, o herbui ‚Äì 1884m. ‚ÄûAu≈°roje‚Äú jƒØ pabandƒó pritaikyti Mikalojus Akelaitis This name came to popular use and was eventually legitimized and became official in the independent Republic of Lithuania. Old Prussian word viÃátingas had a meaning of a nobleman, knight. In the Russophone world and the East Slavic culture there is a similar word Vityaz which means a brave knight or a bold hero. According to the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary, that word is derived from the Old Germanic Witing.Definition of Vityaz by Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary In western South Slavic languages (Slovenian, Croatian/Serbian/Montenegrin and Macedonian) vitez denotes the lowest feudal rank, a knight.  Similar coats of arms  The Pahonia coat of arms of Belarus, which was used in 1918 and again from 1991 to 1995, is very similar to the Vytis, with slight differences. In particular, the patriarchal cross with arms of uneven length is displayed on the shield, the saddle blanket is of the Renaissance style, the horse's tail points down instead of up, and Azure is absent from it altogether. Several Gediminid Lithuanian, Polish and Russian noble families adopted the earlier versions of the coat of arms with some modifications, namely Czartoryski, Trubetzkoy and Galitzine. Recently adopted coats of arms of Vilnius and Panevƒó≈æys counties use different color schemes and add additional details to the basic image of the knight. Several towns in Lithuania use motifs similar to the Vytis. For example, the coat of arms of Liudvinavas is parted per pale. One half depicts the Vytis and the other, Lady Justice.

He served as a general under the preceding dynasty Liu Song's Emperor Ming and Emperor Houfei. In 477, fearful that the young, cruel Emperor Houfei would kill him, assassinated Emperor Houfei and seized power, eventually taking the throne in 479 to start Southern Qi.  Background  Xiao Daocheng was born in 427. His ancestors traced their line to the famed Han Dynasty prime minister Xiao He. If their records were accurate, Xiao Daocheng was Xiao He's 24-generation descendant. During the Jin and Liu Song dynasties, Xiao's ancestors served as low-level officials. His father Xiao Chengzhi () was a general under Emperor Wen of Liu Song, and for his contributions in campaigns against rival Northern Wei was created the Baron of Jinxing. Xiao Daocheng first studied the Confucian classics at the university set up by Emperor Wen and headed by the hermit Lei Cizong (:zh:Èõ∑Ê¨°ÂÆó) when he was 12, but by age 15 he was serving in the military. He continued serving as a military officer during the reigns of Emperors Wen and Xiaowu (Emperor Wen's son).  Under Emperor Ming of Liu Song  By the time that Emperor Xiaowu's brother Emperor Ming and Emperor Xiaowu's son Liu Zixun were fighting for the throne in 466 after the brief reign and assassination of Emperor Xiaowu's son Emperor Qianfei, Xiao Daocheng was a general, and his allegiance was with Emperor Ming. He participated in the campaign against the army nominally commanded by Liu Zixun's brother Liu Zifang () the Prince of Xunyang and governor of Kuaiji Commandery along the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay. He subsequently defeated the army sent south by Xue Andu () the governor of Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û, modern northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui). For these contributions, Emperor Ming created him the Marquess of Xiyang and made him the acting governor of South Xu Province (ÂçóÂæêÂ∑û, modern western central Jiangsu). Later, he became the governor of Southern Yan Province (ÂçóÂÖóÂ∑û, modern eastern central Jiangsu), defending the important city of Huaiyin (Ê∑ÆÈô∞, in modern Huaian, Jiangsu). It was said that, while at this post, he began to engage a group of talented followers. During Emperor Ming's reign, there were rumors that Xiao Daocheng's facial features were unusual and were signs that he would become emperor. By 471, Emperor Ming ‚Äì who had already carried out a campaign of killing most of his brothers and some high-level officials in fear that they would not be loyal to his son Liu Yu the Crown Prince after his death ‚Äì became suspicious of Xiao, particularly because there were rumors that Xiao was secretly communicating with Northern Wei. Emperor Ming sent his general Wu Xi (), a friend of Xiao's, with a sealed pot of wine to Huaiyin to deliver to Xiao. Xiao became fearful that the wine was poisoned and was preparing to flee to Northern Wei. Wu secretly told Xiao that the wine was not poisoned and drank some himself, before Xiao would dare to drink. Once Wu returned to the capital Jiankang, he assured Emperor Ming that Xiao was loyal. But after details of Wu's leaking the information to Xiao became known to Emperor Ming, Emperor Ming forced Wu to commit suicide; he did not take any actions against Xiao. Soon thereafter he recalled Xiao to Jiankang. Xiao's followers largely suspected that Emperor Ming would kill him and suggested that he resist, but Xiao believed that Emperor Ming would not do so. He therefore returned to Jiankang, where he became a commanding general of Crown Prince Yu's guards. (In secret, Xiao told his followers that he believed that Liu Song would not last much longer and that he would need their support when opportunity presented itself.) When Emperor Ming grew gravely ill in 472, on the recommendation of the high-level official Chu Yuan (to whom, along with Yuan Can, Emperor Ming entrusted the care of Crown Prince Yu), who was a friend of Xiao, Xiao became a commanding general of the capital defense force. Emperor Ming soon died, and Crown Prince Yu took the throne as Emperor Houfei.  Under Emperor Houfei of Liu Song  In 474, Emperor Houfei's uncle Liu Xiufan () the Prince of Guiyang and governor of Jiang Province (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi and Fujian), angry that he had not been made the regent, rebelled and made a quick advancement toward Jiankang. At a major military strategy session, although there were a number of high-level officials, powerful associates of the emperor, and senior generals present, no one dared to speak first. Then Xiao Daocheng proposed the strategy of not sending an army to engage Liu Xiufan but rather defend the strong defensive posts in the outskirts of Jiankang and not actively engage Liu Xiufan, forcing him into a stalemate and causing him to run out of food supplies. Without significant opposition, Xiao's plan was adopted. Liu Xiufan's forces soon arrived. He made a direct assault against Xiao's defensive position. With Xiao's approval, his officers Huang Hui () and Zhang Jing'er () falsely surrendered to Liu Xiufan and then further informed Liu Xiufan that Xiao wished to surrender as well. While pretending to secretly convey the information, Zhang and Huang then assassinated Liu Xiufan. However, because they had to then discard Liu Xiufan's head to avoid Liu Xiufan's guards, the news was not known initially. Liu Xiufan's forces intensified their siege against the various defense positions. Xiao was barely able to hold his position, but Liu Xiufan's general Ding Wenhao () was able to defeat and kill Liu Mian () and Wang Daolong () and put the palace under siege. Soon, news of Liu Xiufan's death became gradually known, and Ding's forces collapsed. In the aftermaths of Liu Xiufan's defeat, Xiao was promoted. He, with Yuan Can, Chu Yuan, and Emperor Houfan's distant uncle Liu Bing, were in charge of the affairs of government and known as the \\"four nobles\\" (). In 476, when Emperor Houfei's cousin Liu Jingsu () the governor of South Xu Province, who received wrong information that Jiankang had fallen into a state of confusion, started a rebellion, Xiao coordinated the campaign against Liu Jingsu (although he did not personally command troops), and LIu Jingsu was defeated and killed. In 477, Emperor Houfei, by now age 14, was growing increasingly impulsive and violent, often wandering outside the palace with his guards and killing all people or animals they encountered. One day, he suddenly charged into Xiao's headquarters and saw Xiao sleeping naked. He was intrigued by the large size of Xiao's belly. He woke Xiao up, drew a target on Xiao's belly, and prepared to shoot him with arrows. Xiao pleaded for his life, and Emperor Houfei's attendant Wang Tian'en () pointed out that if he killed Xiao with an arrow, he would lose Xiao's belly as a wonderful target. So, at Wang's suggestion, Emperor Houfei shot Xiao with bone-made round-point arrows and was pleased when he was able to target Xiao's bellybutton successfully. Xiao became fearful after the incident; he initially discussed with Yuan and Chu the possibilities of deposing the emperor but could not get them to go along with his plan. Xiao therefore acted on his own, associating with Emperor Houfei's attendants and eventually getting one of them, Yang Yufu (), to kill Emperor Houfei while Emperor Houfei was asleep. Xiao then forced Yuan and Liu Bing to effectively grant him near-imperial powers, leading to concerns that Xiao would next take the throne.  Under Emperor Shun of Liu Song  Xiao Daocheng made Emperor Houfei's brother Liu Zhun the Prince of Ancheng emperor (as Emperor Shun). In response, the general Shen Youzhi arose with the troops of his Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, modern central and western Hubei), accusing Xiao of wanting to usurp the throne. Yuan Can and Liu Bing also believed that that was Xiao's intent. As Xiao prepared for a campaign against Shen, they secretly planned another uprising within Jiankang to overthrow Xiao. Yuan, believing that the plot would not succeed without Chu Yuan's support, told Chu of the plot as well. Chu, who was friendly with Xiao, quickly informed Xiao. Yuan, not aware of this, continued his preparations, aligning with a number of generals and preparing to rise. However, Liu Bing panicked during the preparation stage and fled to Yuan's defense post at the fortress of Shitou Cheng several hours before the scheduled time, alarming Xiao and allowing him to further start a counterinsurrection, arresting and killing several generals aligned with Yuan and Liu Bing before they could act. Xiao's troops then sieged Yuan's defenses at Shitou, killing Yuan and Liu Bing. Meanwhile, the provincial governors whom Shen invited to join him all declined and either resisted him or stood by. Shen nevertheless had a strong army, and the imperial army generals were apprehensive about facing him. He initially progressed quickly toward Jiankang. But as he went past Yingcheng (ÈÉ¢Âüé, in modern Wuhan, Hubei), he was provoked by insults of Liu Shilong (), the chief of staff for Liu Zan () the Prince of Wuling and governor of Ying Province into stopping and putting the well-fortified Yingcheng under siege. In 478, with his forces unable to capture Yingcheng, Shen Youzhi's soldiers began to desert. Shen aggravated the situation by imposing severe punishments on the commanding officers of deserting soldiers ‚Äî which caused them to desert. Shen's officer Liu Rangbing () surrendered to Liu Shilong, causing his forces to collapse. Shen tried to retreat to Jiangling (the capital of Jing Province). By the time he did so, Zhang Jing'er, whom Xiao had made the governor of Yong Province (ÈõçÂ∑û, modern southwestern Henan and southwestern Hubei) with the intent of having him attack Shen from the rear, had already captured Jiangling and killed Shen Yuanyan, whom Shen Youzhi had left in charge of Jiangling. Shen's remaining army ‚Äî seeing that Jiangling had fallen, collapsed, and he initially tried to flee, but realizing that his escape route had been cut off he committed suicide. Xiao was now without substantial opposition, particularly after he killed Huang Hui, who had been implicated in conspiracies with Liu Jingsu and Yuan Can, later that year after Huang showed signs of insubordination. He began to put his sons into important posts as well. He also engaged the nobly born official Wang Jian as a key assistant and, with Chu's tacit agreement, started making moves toward the throne, including quietly assassinating Emperor Houfei's brothers. In 479, over a brief two months, he had Emperor Shun create him the Duke of Qi, and then the Prince of Qi, and bestow upon him the nine bestowments, all progressive steps toward the throne. In summer 479, he forced the fearful Emperor Shun into yielding the throne to him, ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi, as its Emperor Gao.  Reign  left A major trend that Emperor Gao tried to start after he took the throne was a move against wastefulness and luxury and a move toward frugality. He appeared to be fairly frugal, although the effects his edicts on those subjects had on his officials and nobles are unclear. Later in 479, when someone was riding a horse near the mansion of the former Emperor Shun (now the Prince of Ruyin), the guards whom Emperor Gao posted to watch over the former emperor panicked, believing someone was about to start a rebellion. They killed the former emperor. Emperor Gao did not punish these guards, but rewarded them and further carried out a massacre of Liu Song's imperial clan. Later that year, he made princes of his son Xiao Ze (who had by that point been known as an able general, now crown prince), his other sons, as well as Xiao Ze's oldest son Xiao Zhangmao. Meanwhile, Emperor Gao received reports that Northern Wei was about to make an attack and claim to be trying to reestablish Liu Song on the behalf of Liu Chang () the Prince of Danyang, a son of Liu Song's Emperor Wen who had in 465 fled to Northern Wei over fears that Emperor Qianfei would kill him. Emperor Gao prepared the northern borders in anticipation of a major attack, which Northern Wei launched in winter 479. The Northern Wei attack, however, after Northern Wei forces made a failed siege of Shouyang. Realizing that Jiankang was relatively defenseless (as throughout Jin and Liu Song, a wall had never been built around Jiankang), he started a construction project to build a wall around Jiankang. Northern Wei and Southern Qi forces would continue to have minor border battles for another year, until spring 481, but there would be no further major campaigns by either side. In spring 482, Emperor Gao died. Crown Prince Ze succeeded him as Emperor Wu.

The lake has been completely dry during several discrete periods of its geologic history. Alexander von Humboldt visited the lake in 1800. He documented the negative impact of the surrounding population's land cultivation on the ecosystem. Deforestation and water diversion for irrigation led to the desiccation of Lake Valencia by dramatically reducing water levels. Lake Valencia is where Humboldt developed his conception of anthropogenic climate change. He later wrote: > When forests are destroyed, as they are everywhere in America by the > European planters, with an imprudent precipitation, the springs are entirely > dried up, or become less abundant, The beds of the rivers remaining dry > during a part of the year, are converted into torrents, whenever great rains > fall on the heights.

Since 1976 Lake Valencia water levels have risen due to diversion of water from neighboring watersheds‚Äîit currently acts as a reservoir for the surrounding urban centers (such as Maracay and Valencia). Ecology The lake suffers from algal blooms caused by continual influx of untreated wastewater from the surrounding urban, agricultural, and industrial land uses. This contributes to ongoing eutrophication, contamination, and salinization of the lake. Despite its picturesque location between the Cordillera de la Costa to the north and the Serrania del Interior to the south, Lake Valencia's poor water quality limits opportunities for tourism and recreational activities. Due to pollution and other human induced changes, almost 60% of the native fish species in the lake were lost between 1960 and 1990.L√≥pez-Rojas, H., and A. L.

He is known as the Prince of Yulin because that was the title he was posthumously demoted to after his granduncle Xiao Luan assassinated him in 494. During his brief reign, he was known as overly devoting his time on games and pleasure, unaware that the ambitious Xiao Luan had targeted him for removal, and after his death, Xiao Luan briefly made his brother Xiao Zhaowen emperor, but then seized the throne himself.  Background  Xiao Zhaoye was born in 473, when his great- grandfather Xiao Daocheng was a Liu Song general. Initially, after Xiao Daocheng seized the throne in 479, ending Liu Song and establishing Southern Qi (as its Emperor Gao), Xiao Zhaoye's father Xiao Zhangmao, as the oldest son of the crown prince Xiao Ze, was created the Prince of Nan Commandery. Xiao Zhaoye's mother Wang Baoming, Xiao Zhangmao's wife, was created the Princess of Nan Commandery. Xiao Zhaoye himself was not given any titles at the moment. He was the only son of Xiao Zhangmao born of Princess Wang, as she was not much favored by her husband.  As Prince of Nan Commandery, then Crown Prince  In 482, after Emperor Gao died, Xiao Ze succeeded him as Emperor Wu. Xiao Zhangmao was created the Crown Prince, and Xiao Zhaoye, as Xiao Zhangmao's oldest son, was given his father's old title of Prince of Nan Commandery. In 484, at age 11, he married He Jingying as his princess. On the surface, when Xiao Zhaoye was the Prince of Nan Commandery, he was thought to be studious, careful, filially pious, elegant in his behavior, and dexterious. Therefore, his grandfather Emperor Wu favored him greatly. However, when not in the presence of his grandfather or father, Xiao Zhaoye was instead frivolous and spending time with people who were bad influences. During this time, he lived with his uncle Xiao Ziliang (Ëï≠Â≠êËâØ) the Prince of Jingling in Xifu (Ë•øÂ∫ú), an important suburb of the capital Jiankang. As Xiao Zhangmao often limited his activities and budget, Xiao Zhaoye often borrowed money from rich households, who would not dare to refuse. He also duplicated a set of keys for the fortress gates so that he could spend night time in games at various military camps. Exasperated, his teachers Shi Renzu (Âè≤‰ªÅÁ•ñ) and Hu Tianyi (ËÉ°Â§©Áøº), believing that they and their households would be in trouble regardless of whether they informed this to Emperor Wu or Crown Prince Zhangmao or not, both committed suicide. Xiao Ziliang's wife Princess Yuan raised him with love, but Xiao Zhaoye, as he grew, became suspicious that his uncle was interested in taking the throne himself. Xiao Zhaoye's wife Princess He was known for her adulterous activities, as she carried on affairs with others while she was princess. The most infamous affair she carried out was with Xiao Zhaoye's attendant Yang Min (Ê•äÁèâ) -- it was said that they spent day and night together, just like husband and wife. However, He Jingying also was very loving in her relationship with Xiao Zhaoye, and so Xiao Zhaoye turned a blind eye to her adulterous activities. (Some historians indicate that there could have also been a sexual relationship between Xiao Zhaoye and Yang Min, suggesting a m√©nage √† trois.) In 493, when Xiao Zhangmao was ill, Xiao Zhaoye displayed great distress, so much so that his own health appeared to be in jeopardy, and those who saw him were touched. However, as soon as he arrived at his house, he became happy and feasted. He often requested a witch named Yang to curse his grandfather and father so that he could become emperor sooner. Soon, Xiao Zhangmao died, and Xiao Zhaoye gave Lady Yang much rewards, believing her curses to be effective, and asked her to continue to curse his grandfather. Not realizing Xiao Zhaoye's activities, Emperor Wu created Xiao Zhaoye crown prince to replace Xiao Zhangmao. Princess He was created crown princess, and Crown Princess Wang became crown princess dowager. Emperor Wu himself soon fell sick, and while Xiao Zhaoye continued to put on a front of distress, he was in fact quite happy, and when he wrote to the Crown Princess, he wrote one large character of Xi (Âñú, meaning \\"happiness\\") surrounded by 36 smaller Xi characters. As Emperor Wu fell extremely ill, the official Wang Rong (ÁéãËûç), who was friendly with Xiao Ziliang, tried to carry out a plot to put Xiao Ziliang on the throne instead of Xiao Zhaoye. The plot, however, was thwarted by Emperor Wu's cousin Xiao Luan the Marquess of Xichang, and after Emperor Wu soon died late in 493, Xiao Zhaoye took the throne.  Reign  Emperor Wu's will instructed Xiao Zhaoye to entrust governmental matters to Xiao Ziliang and Xiao Luan, but Xiao Zhaoye, believing Xiao Ziliang to be complicit in Wang Rong's plot, immediately carried out several actions that were intended to show his distrust, leaving actual power in Xiao Luan's hands while entrusting palace and military matters to several associates he endeared himself to while he was the Prince of Nan Commandery, while leaving Xiao Ziliang with a highly honored but ceremonial post. Xiao Zhaoye also ordered Wang to commit suicide. As soon as Emperor Wu was placed in a coffin, Xiao Zhaoye resumed the playing of music, which was traditionally considered inappropriate during times of mourning. He also took Emperor Wu's favorite concubine Consort Huo as his own consort‚Äîan act then considered incest‚Äîand, in order to avoid this from being known, had her name changed to Xu. He honored Crown Princess Dowager Wang as empress dowager, while creating Crown Princess He empress. He spent his days on feasting, games, and on rewarding his associates, often seen talking to money, \\"Before, it was not easy for me to obtain even one of you. Now there is no one to stop me from using you.\\" The treasury surpluses that the frugal Emperor Gao and the relatively frugal Emperor Wu built up were expended in less than a year. His associates were selling offices openly, and Xiao Zhaoye not only did not curb them in, but approved their requests handily. Xiao Luan, seeing that Xiao Zhaoye was not behaving appropriately, began considering deposing Xiao Zhaoye. He also often counseled Xiao Zhaoye to change his ways, but Xiao Zhaoye did not listen and began to be suspicious of Xiao Luan, particularly after Xiao Luan subsequently forced him to execute Empress He's lover Yang Min and his associate Xu Longju (ÂæêÈæçÈßí) after accusing them of crimes. He tried to discuss the matter with Emperor Wu's younger brother Xiao Qiang (Ëï≠Èèò) the Prince of Poyang, who however opposed to the action. Meanwhile, Xiao Zhaoye's trusted generals Xiao Chen (Ëï≠Ë´∂) and Xiao Tanzhi (Ëï≠Âù¶‰πã), seeing how frivolous his actions were, instead secretly joined Xiao Luan's party and were informing Xiao Luan of Xiao Zhaoye's actions. Soon, Xiao Luan was finding excuses to execute several other associates of Xiao Zhaoye‚Äîincluding the general Zhou Fengshu (Âë®Â•âÂèî), the teacher Du Wenqian (ÊùúÊñáË¨ô), and the head of the household Qiwu Zhenzhi (Á∂¶ÊØãÁèç‰πã) -- in order to weaken Xiao Zhaoye's associates. Meanwhile, Xiao Zhaoye's own alertness was reduced after Xiao Ziliang died of anxiety in summer 494. By fall 494, however, Xiao Zhaoye was tired of Xiao Luan, and he plotted with Empress He's uncle He Yin (‰ΩïËÉ§) to have Xiao Luan killed. He Yin did not dare to do so, and suggested that Xiao Luan be observed further. Xiao Zhaoye therefore stopped giving important tasks to Xiao Luan. Xiao Luan then started his coup, in conjunction with Xiao Chen and Xiao Tanzhi‚Äîand Xiao Zhaoye, not realizing that Xiao Chen and Xiao Tanzhi had betrayed him, sought help from Xiao Chen when he realized Xiao Luan was beginning an attack on the palace. His hopes were dashed when he saw Xiao Chen enter the palace. His palace guards were still ready to fight, but Xiao Zhaoye instead fled, and Xiao Chen chased him down and killed him. Xiao Luan issued an edict in Empress Dowager Wang's name, demoting Xiao Zhaoye to the rank of prince (with the title of Prince of Yulin, which became the title by which he was thereafter known) and making his younger brother Xiao Zhaowen, the Prince of Xin'an, emperor.

He is known as the Prince of Hailing because that was the title he was demoted to after he was deposed by his granduncle Xiao Luan in 494. (Xiao Luan had made him emperor earlier in 494 after assassinating his brother Xiao Zhaoye.) After Xiao Luan deposed him and assumed the throne himself, he had Xiao Zhaowen poisoned.  Background  Xiao Zhaowen was born in 480, as the second son of the then-Southern Qi Price of Nan Commandery Xiao Zhangmao, the oldest son of the crown prince Xiao Ze. His mother was Xiao Zhangmao's concubine Lady Xu. Little is known about his childhood. After the death of his great-grandfather Emperor Gao in 482, his grandfather Xiao Ze became emperor (as Emperor Wu), and his father Xiao Zhangmao became Crown Prince. In 486, at age six, Xiao Zhaowen was created the Duke of Linru. In 490, he married Wang Shaoming, the daughter of the official Wang Ci (ÁéãÊÖà), as his duchess. Early in 493, his father Xiao Zhangmao died, and his older brother Xiao Zhaoye became Crown Prince. Several months later, still in 493, Emperor Wu died as well, and Xiao Zhaoye became emperor. Xiao Zhaoye created Xiao Zhaowen the Prince of Xin'an. Xiao Zhaoye was a frivolous and wasteful ruler, spending much time in feast and games. In fall 494, the prime minister Xiao Luan the Marquess of Xichang, cousin of Emperor Wu, seeing Xiao Zhaoye as an incompetent ruler and believing that Xiao Zhaoye was going to act against him, carried out a coup and assassinated Xiao Zhaoye. He placed Xiao Zhaowen on the throne to succeed Xiao Zhaoye.  Reign  While Xiao Zhaowen, now 14, carried the title of emperor, actual authority was in the hands of Xiao Luan, and Xiao Luan had himself initially created the Duke of Xuancheng, and then the Prince of Xuancheng. In Xiao Zhaowen's name, Xiao Luan soon carried out the executions of a large number of princes who were sons of Emperors Gao and Wu, whom he viewed as threats against himself: * Xiao Qiang (Ëï≠Èèò), the Prince of Poyang, son of Emperor Gao * Xiao Zilong (Ëï≠Â≠êÈöÜ), the Prince of Sui, son of Emperor Wu * Xiao Zimao (Ëï≠Â≠êÊáã), the Prince of Jin'an, son of Emperor Wu * Xiao Zijing (Ëï≠Â≠êÊï¨), the Prince of Anlu, son of Emperor Wu * Xiao Rui (Ëï≠Èä≥), the Prince of Nanping, son of Emperor Gao * Xiao Qiu (Ëï≠Èä∂), the Prince of Jinxi, son of Emperor Gao * Xiao Keng (Ëï≠Èèó), the Prince of Yidu, son of Emperor Gao * Xiao Shuo (Ëï≠Èë†), the Prince of Guiyang, son of Emperor Gao * Xiao Jun (Ëï≠Èàû), the Prince of Hengyang, son of Emperor Gao * Xiao Feng (Ëï≠Èãí), the Prince of Jiangxia, son of Emperor Gao * Xiao Zizhen (Ëï≠Â≠êÁúü), the Prince of Jian'an, son of Emperor Wu * Xiao Zilun (Ëï≠Â≠êÂÄ´), the Prince of Baling, son of Emperor Wu * Xiao Ziqing (Ëï≠Â≠êÂçø), the Prince of Luling, son of Emperor Wu Initially, Xiao Zhaowen's younger brother Xiao Zhaoxiu (Ëï≠Êò≠ÁßÄ), the Prince of Linhai, was to be killed as well, but was spared at the last minute. In place of these imperial princes from Emperors Gao and Wu's lines, Xiao Luan, because his own sons were young, installed his nephews Xiao Yaoguang (Ëï≠ÈÅôÂÖâ), Xiao Yaoxin (Ëï≠ÈÅôÊ¨£), and Xiao Yaochang (Ëï≠ÈÅôÊòå) in important posts. Less than three months after Xiao Zhaowen became emperor, Xiao Luan issued an edict in the name of Xiao Zhangmao's wife Empress Dowager Wang Baoming, stating that Xiao Zhaowen was not sufficiently intelligent and healthy to be emperor, giving the throne to Xiao Luan, who then took the throne as Emperor Ming.  After reign  The edict deposing Xiao Zhaowen created him the title of the Prince of Hailing. About a month after he was removed from the throne, however, Xiao Luan, on pretenses that Xiao Zhaowen was ill, sent imperial physicians to see him, but instead instructed the physicians to have him poisoned.

Martin began producing music under the Joy Electric name in 1994, after the demise of Dance House Children, a band Ronnie was in with his brother Jason Martin of Starflyer 59. Starflyer 59 bass player and Velvet Blue Music owner Jeff Cloud joined Joy Electric from 1996 until 2002. Joy Electric is currently a solo act.  Pre-Joy Electric history  Having experimented with live shows, formed countless after-school bands, and recorded an album that was never to be released under the moniker Morella's Forest with Randy Lamb, Ronnie and his brother Jason found their way onto Michael Knott's fledgling label, Blonde Vinyl, with a dance album to produce, Songs and Stories. After buying an old Akai sampler and a few synthesizers, Ronnie began crafting his own spin-off of current electronic \\"club\\" music. Still working with his brother Jason, Ronnie's new band, Dance House Children, posited cold, hypnotic electronica against quaint, old-fashioned lyrics. After producing another album, Jesus, Dance House Children found Jason leaving to pursue his own musical endeavors, Starflyer 59. With the help of a few friends, Ronnie turned from the club-oriented music to a more melodic, orchestrated sound. A large range of instruments were used on his third album, containing timpanis, Moog synthesizers, and far more exotic sounds than anything he had previously produced. It was evident that Martin was quickly moving beyond the level of pre-programmed keyboard sounds as he became more well-versed in the programming of his synthesizers. Rainbow Rider: Beautiful Dazzling Music No. 1, the name of his third album, formed the bridge between Martin's \\"techno\\"-like early days and his enigmatic Joy Electric creation. Rainbow Rider was part of the name of Ronnie's third album, rather than a change in the name of the musical group from Dance House Children.  Melody and Five Stars for Failure  During the process of writing his fourth album - originally intended as Beautiful Dazzling Music No. 2, then Fairy Tale Melodies (some Tooth and Nail promotional material came out with this name), and then later to be renamed simply as Melody - Martin found the sound of his project changing radically. Of course, changes were quite evident during Beautiful Dazzling Music, but this fourth album carried things to the extreme. Analog synths began to dominate the studio floor-space. Furthermore, Martin began perfecting a clock-like musical technique that had a strange assortment of blips and whirls constantly rotating in the background. The fourth album resulted in several things: a new band name (Joy Electric), his signing with a new label (Tooth & Nail Records), and the launching of Martin's signature sound which he carries to this day.  We Are the Music Makers and Old Wives Tales  By this time, Martin became increasingly fascinated with the idea of musical \\"purism\\". Finding inspiration in '70s electronic bands that were \\"purists\\" out of necessity (having nothing but simple analog synthesizers with which to assemble an entire collage of blurpy sounds), Martin delegated nearly his entire studio to the closet and vowed to build an album up, brick by brick, from the sounds of just one master synthesizer. Under this constraint he went to work‚Äîdesigning, programming, and storing all his sounds for the new album in a Roland JD-990. Putting all his eggs in one basket (or synthesizer in this case) left Martin particularly vulnerable to one perennial problem: his synthesizer's storage memory got wiped clean.Martin, Ronnie. Liner Notes. Joy Electric 1994-2002 The Art and Craft of Popular Music. 2002. It's uncertain how this happened, but halfway through the new album Martin found that all his work had been lost. Martin had to begin again from scratch. Taking this opportunity to reconsider his approach, he decided to move into an even more purist direction than before, determined to create a cohesive synthesizer concept album with a medieval, Tolkienesque feel. Since the first half-completed album is no longer in existence, it is impossible to gauge just how radical a change this was from Martin's original effort. We Are the Music Makers includes Arthurian songs of dim castles, assemblies of knights riding out to battle, dedications to monarchy, and crumbling recollections of Christendom. This Medieval theme was unusual subject matter for a mid-'90s electronic album. Of all his albums, Martin consistently cites this as his least favorite. (On top of feeling burnt out from the amount of work he put into the album, he came to feel in retrospect that the albums' more experimental sound concealed a somewhat subpar group of songs, in terms of hooks and melodies). Some find the album shows Martin's inexperience at this new \\"purist\\" model. However, other fans claim that this album contains some of Martin's most memorable and emblematic work, including \\"Burgundy Years,\\" \\"Hansel (I Will Be Your Friend),\\" and \\"I Beam, You Beam\\". Martin quickly followed this album with yet another EP, this one titled Old Wives Tales. While retaining the Black Forest fairy-tale theme, he dropped the darker, gothic strains and produced a set of songs mixing pop and nostalgia. Joy Electric, in some way or another, has always been an escapist band, leading the listener into a sort of musical land largely unfamiliar and isolated. Old Wives Tales stands as the high-point of that escapism, and proved to be just what fans were looking for. Audiences began to grow, the EP sold in greater numbers, and favorable articles appeared in all sorts of music magazines .  Robot Rock and Christiansongs  Riding this building wave of popularity, Joy Electric began commanding greater respect both abroad and at home. This attention at Tooth & Nail was especially critical, leading to a series of albums that were designed to, and indeed succeeded in, garnering some degree of commercial success. Music videos were made and became more widely distributed. The music moved out of cult circles and picked up new fans in rapid numbers. Robot Rock was the first album to capitalize on this. The album moved away from the world of \\"bedroom production\\" and into professional studio hands. The vocals came across as polished and well-groomed. Having practiced on his analog synthesizers for years, Martin commanded better control of his synthesizers' sounds. To showcase these growing skills, the songs were generally more sparse. The entire album harked back, more than any other release, to his groundbreaking work in Melody. Following his pattern, Martin released an EP as well, titled The Land of Misfits, containing \\"Monosynth\\", two remixes of songs from Robot Rock, a remix of \\"The Cobbler\\" from Old Wives Tales EP and one new song. It was generally considered a disappointment by fans, containing only one new song along with reworkings of songs from Robot Rock. Eventually another EP materialized, the Children of the Lord maxi single. While still including covers on the EP, Martin this time brought some greater variety to the release. Two songs covered radically different influences: Punk rockers MxPx and seventies singer Keith Green. The last song was a Cloud2Ground remix of a song from the upcoming album. In 1999, Christiansongs was released. Concerning the title, Martin explained his frustration over Christian music groups attempting to downplay their religion in hopes for greater commercial success. Having grown up a Christian, Martin had rarely allowed his faith to intrude heavily upon his music. He nevertheless disapproved of statements like \\"we're Christians but we're not a Christian band\\". In contrast, and to set the record straight for any fans, Martin's new album title left no doubt concerning the matter. Christiansongs contained some of Joy Electric's most overt references to Christianity, exhorting believers to remain strong (\\"Lift Up Your Hearts\\"), singing musical prayers of religious dedication (\\"Make My Life a Prayer\\", which was a cover of a song written by Melody Green), and proclaiming general obedience to God (\\"True Harmony\\"). But the album contained deep lyrical divides. The religious songs were overwhelmingly religious. The other half of the album was, more or less, the usual Joy Electric fare. Christiansongs also demonstrated Martin's ability to move beyond bubbly-happy songs that critics condemned for being too shallow. The album showcased a wide range of feelings, spanning to familiar exuberant territory all the way into new, darker directions.  The Legacy Series  2001 saw the release of Legacy Volume 1: The White Songbook. A year and a half in the making, The White Songbook continued in the synthesized tradition of the past few albums by using nothing but a Roland System 100, but with many intricate and interwoven layers of sounds building on each other. The music was divided into four thematic chapters, and the very sparse artwork of the album was meant to invoke the sense of an old book. This album also brought the relatively successful single \\"We Are Rock.\\" In spite of a level of critical success, Ronnie was miserable during the album's long and tedious production. The companion EP to this album is Starcadia, which has since gone out of print and become a much sought after collectible. The Legacy series continued with The Tick Tock Treasury, whose sparseness was a musical reaction to the thick and lush nature of The White Songbook. Instead of including lyrics in the booklet, Ronnie opted to include a short story which served as inspiration for the title of the album. As opposed to The White Songbook, The Tick Tock Treasury's placement in the Legacy series was found only in a small and passing liner note in the CD insert. The companion EP to this album is The Tick Tock Companion, a long-running set of experimental synthesizer music recorded in one take. The third Legacy album was Hello, Mannequin. Like its predecessor, its place in the Legacy series was only shown by a small liner note. This album brought a significantly more rigid structure to the songs, with basslines sometimes not changing for the duration of an entire track. The companion EP, Friend of Mannequin, contains remixes, several new songs, and a three-part interview. The Ministry of Archers, identified as a Legacy album only by the mark \\"lv4\\" (for Legacy Volume 4) in the liner notes, was also the first to be produced in the newly renovated Electric Joy Toy Company on Ronnie's new Moog synthesizer equipment. The new synthesizer brought a significant change in sound, though the album bears some resemblance to previous Legacy works. Namely, it is broken into chapters like The White Songbook and its lyrics are not printed in the sleeve, like The Tick Tock Treasury. The companion EP, Montgolfier and the Romantic Balloons, is split into two sections: an eponymous mini concept album, and a collection of remixes and extra tracks called \\"Other Archers.\\" The Otherly Opus was released on March 20, 2007 as the fifth and final volume in the Legacy series, noted as \\"Moog Dynasty Years Volume 2\\". The album includes some of the most intricate vocal work on a Joy Electric album to date. Thematically, the album is split in two-halves. The first half is known as The Otherly Opus, while the second half is The Memory of Alpha, a mini concept album about antediluvian times. The album's companion EP, Their Variables, contains remixes of all songs on The Otherly Opus as well as two new songs. It was released on September 18, 2007. Moog Dynasty Continuing on the Moog tradition of the previous two albums, Joy Electric's album My Grandfather, The Cubist was released May 27, 2008. The following year, two EPs were released: Early Cubism is a digital download consisting of demos of three tracks from My Grandfather, The Cubist, while Curiosities and Such contains six new songs. In 2009, Joy Electric released \\"Favorites at Play\\", an album composed of covers of artists such as Coldplay, The Killers, Blink 182 and more. Dwarf Mountain Alphabet On March 20, 2012, Joy Electric announced that the new album would be released independently. A Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise $6,000 to fund the project. The goal was reached within nine hours. Dwarf Mountain Alphabet had been previously announced in an interview with Ronnie Martin in Fall 2011. The album was released on December 4, 2012.

The African pied hornbill is a common resident breeder in much of equatorial Africa, from The Gambia to western Uganda and northern Angola. This is a bird of mainly forest habitats. The female lays up to four white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off during incubation with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and the chicks. Morphology This is a large bird, in length. It has mainly black plumage, with white belly and tail tip. The long, curved black and yellow bill has a medium-sized casque. The sexes are similar, but the female has a smaller casque. Immature birds are duller, have a smaller bill, and no casque. The flight is undulating. Behaviour The African pied hornbill is omnivorous and eats fruit and insects. It feeds mainly in trees and is attracted to oil palms. This conspicuous and gregarious bird advertises its presence with its whistling pii-pii-pii-pii- call. When the chicks and the female are too big to fit in the nest, the mother breaks out and rebuilds the wall. Then both parents feed the chicks.

It frequently consists of skin, hair follicles, and sweat glands, while other commonly found components include clumps of long hair, pockets of sebum, blood, fat, bone, nail, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue. As dermoid cysts grow slowly and contain mature tissue, this type of cystic teratoma is nearly always benign. In those rare cases wherein the dermoid cyst is malignant, a squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in adults, while infants and children usually present with an endodermal sinus tumor.Freedberg, et al. (2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine. (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . Location Due to its classification, a dermoid cyst can occur wherever a teratoma can occur. =Vaginal and ovarian dermoid cysts= Ovaries normally grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month. Once an egg is released from its follicle during ovulation, follicles typically deflate. Sometimes fluid accumulates inside the follicle, forming a simple (containing only fluid) cyst. The majority of these functional cysts resolve spontaneously. While all ovarian cysts can range in size from very small to quite large, dermoid cysts are not classified as functional cysts. Dermoid cysts originate from totipotential germ cells (which are present at birth) that differentiate abnormally, developing characteristics of mature dermal cells. Complications exist, such as torsion (twisting), rupture, and infection, although their incidence is rare. Dermoid ovarian cysts which are larger present complications which might require removal by either laparoscopy or laparotomy (traditional surgery). Rarely, a dermoid cyst can develop in the vagina.

Arrow points to bone or teeth. =Periorbital dermoid cysts= Dermoid cysts can appear in young children, often near the lateral aspect of the eyebrow (right part of the right eyebrow or left part of the left eyebrow). Depending on the perceived amount of risk, these are sometimes excised or simply kept under observation. An inflammatory reaction can occur if a dermoid cyst is disrupted, and the cyst can recur if it is not completely excised. Sometimes complete excision is not practical if the cyst is in a dumbbell configuration, whereby it extends through a suture line in the skull. If dermoid cysts appear on the medial aspect, the possibility of an encephalocele becomes greater and should be considered among the differential diagnoses. Other areas where a dermoid cyst may appear are the brain, scrotum and the pharynx. Dermoid cysts develop during pregnancy. They occur when skin cells and things like hair, sweat glands, oil glands or fatty tissue get trapped in the skin as a baby grows in the womb. Dermoid cysts are present at birth (congenital) and are common. It can be months or years before a dermoid cyst is noticed on a child because the cysts grow slowly. Dermoid cyst symptoms are minor and the cysts are usually painless. They are not harmful to a child‚Äôs health. If they become infected, the infection must be treated and the cyst should be removed. It is easier to remove cysts and prevent scars if the cyst is removed before it gets infected. =Spinal dermoid cysts= Spinal dermoid cysts are benign ectopic growths thought to be a consequence of embryology errors during neural tube closure. Their reported incidence is extremely rare, accounting for less than 1% of intramedullary spinal cord tumours. It has been proposed that a possible 180 cases of spinal dermoid tumours have been identified over the past century in the literature. Dermoid cysts more often involve the lumbosacral region than the thoracic vertebrae and are extramedullary presenting in the first decade of life. Various hypotheses have been advanced to explain the pathogenesis of spinal dermoids, the origin of which may be acquired or congenital. * Acquired or iatrogenic dermoids may arise from the implantation of epidermal tissue into the subdural space i.e. spinal cutaneous inclusion, during needle puncture (e.g. lumbar puncture) or during surgical procedures on closure of a dysraphic malformation. * Congenital dermoids, however, are thought to arise from cells whose position is correct but which fail to differentiate into the correct cell-type. The long-time held belief was that the inclusion of cutaneous ectodermal cells occurred early in embryonic life, and the displaced pluripotent cells developed into a dermoid lesion. Spinal abnormalities, e.g. intramedullary dermoid cysts may arise more frequently in the lumbosacral region (quite often at the level of the conus medullaris) and may be seen with other congenital anomalies of the spine including posterior spina bifida occulta as identified by the neuroradiological analysis. Diagnosis =Differential diagnosis= A small dermoid cyst on the coccyx can be difficult to distinguish from a pilonidal cyst. This is partly because both can be full of hair. A pilonidal cyst is a pilonidal sinus that is obstructed. Any teratoma near the body surface may develop a sinus or a fistula, or even a cluster of these. Such is the case of Canadian Football League linebacker Tyrone Jones, whose teratoma was discovered when he blew a tooth out of his nose. Treatment Treatment for dermoid cyst is complete surgical removal, preferably in one piece and without any spillage of cyst contents. Marsupialization, a surgical technique often used to treat pilonidal cyst, is inappropriate for dermoid cyst due to the risk of malignancy. The association of dermoid cysts with pregnancy has been increasingly reported. They usually present the dilemma of weighing the risks of surgery and anesthesia versus the risks of untreated adnexal mass. Most references state that it is more feasible to treat bilateral dermoid cysts of the ovaries discovered during pregnancy if they grow beyond 6 cm in diameter.

He was a lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, and later Dean of Trinity College. until his death in 1983 from cancer.. Robinson was considered a major force in shaping liberal Christian theology. Along with Harvard theologian Harvey Cox, he spearheaded the field of secular theology and, like William Barclay, he was a believer in universal salvation.. Early life and education Robinson was born on 16 May 1919 in the precincts of Canterbury Cathedral, England, where his late father had been a canon. He was educated at Marlborough College, then an all-boys' independent school in Marlborough, Wiltshire. He studied at Jesus College, Cambridge and Trinity College, Cambridge, and then trained for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge. Ordained ministry Robinson was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 1945 and as a priest in 1946. From 1945 to 1948, he served his curacy at St Matthew's Church, Moorfields in the Diocese of Bristol. The vicar at the time was Mervyn Stockwood. In 1948, Robinson became chaplain of Wells Theological College, where he wrote his first book, In the End, God. In 1951, he was appointed Fellow and Dean of Clare College, Cambridge and a lecturer in divinity at Cambridge University.. Following an invitation from Stockwood, by then the Bishop of Southwark, Robinson became the Bishop of Woolwich in 1959.Crockford's Clerical Directory, 1977-79, Oxford University Press The appointment of Robinson as a suffragan bishop was in Stockwood's gift, and whilst the Archbishop of Canterbury (at that point Geoffrey Fisher) questioned the appointment on the grounds that he believed Robinson at that point would be doing more valuable work as a theologian, he accepted that once he had given advice he had \\"done all that it was proper for him to do\\" and proceeded to consecrate Robinson to the episcopate. In 1960 Robinson served as a witness for the defence in the obscenity trial of Penguin Books for the publication of D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. Following a ten-year period at Woolwich, Robinson returned to Cambridge in 1969 as Fellow and Dean of Chapel at Trinity College, where he lectured and continued to write. Death Robinson was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1983 and died on 5 December of that year in Arncliffe, North Yorkshire. Selected writings =In the End, God (1950)= Modern Universalist writer Brian Hebblethwaite cites Robinson's In the End, God: A Study of the Christian Doctrine of the Last Things as arguing for the universal reconciliation of all immortal souls. Ken R. Vincent, in The Golden Thread states: \\"Robinson notes that Christ, in Origen's old words, remains on the Cross so long as one sinner remains in [H]ell. This is not speculation: it is a statement grounded in the very necessity of God's nature.\\" George Hunsinger, author of Disruptive Grace: Studies in the Theology of Karl Barth writes that \\"[i]f one is looking for an uninhibited proponent of universal salvation, Robinson leaves nothing to be desired.\\" =Jesus and His Coming (1957) = In this book, an analysis of the early history of the doctrine of the parousia, Robinson states: \\"That the heart of the Christian hope was now, once more to 'wait for God's son from heaven', for a second and final coming which would complete and crown the first, is a belief for which we have found no firm foundation in the words of Jesus himself.\\" Robinson further argued that there was a tendency in the early church to alter the meaning of sayings of Jesus that originally referred to his death and ascension into heaven, to refer to an event in the future that had not yet happened. =Honest to God (1963)= Robinson wrote several well-received books. The most popular was Honest to God published in 1963. According to Exploration into God in (1967), he felt its chief contribution was its attempt to synthesize the work of theologians Paul Tillich and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, both of them well known in theological circles, but whose views were largely unknown to the people in the pews. The book proved contentious because it called on Christians to view God as the \\"Ground of Being\\" rather than as a supernatural being \\"out there\\". The modifications of the Divine image posited by Robinson have some aspects in common with the psychological deconstruction of God-ideas put forward by his fellow Cambridge theologian Harry Williams in his contribution to the symposium \\"Soundings\\" edited by Alec Vidler and published in 1962. When that book was being produced, Robinson was not asked to contribute, because he was then thought to be too conservative a New Testament scholar. This view has never quite dissipated, for in his later books, Robinson would champion early dates and apostolic authorship for the gospels, largely without success, although in recent years the liberal Baptist theologian and spiritual writer John Henson has claimed some affinity with the idea that the Fourth Gospel was the earliest. The media furore concerning \\"Honest to God\\" ‚Äì one which was to portray him as anything but conservative in the public mind - led to a criticism of Robinson in the Church Assembly ‚Äì the precursor of the General Synod by the Archbishop of Canterbury Michael Ramsey, and there were calls from many quarters for Robinson to resign or be deposed. Whilst Ramsey took Robinson to task for his views, Ramsey's pamphlet \\"Image Old and New\\" rushed out as a response, did not entirely dismiss what had been said. Indeed, Ramsey would later admit in a letter to Mervyn Stockwood that he regretted the way in which he had handled the matter. The book, which has remained almost consistently in print, proposes abandoning the notion of God \\"out there\\", existing somewhere as a \\"cosmic supremo\\", just as we have abandoned already the idea of God \\"up there\\", the notion of \\"the old man up in the sky\\". In its place, he offered a reinterpretation of God as \\"Love\\". After endorsing Paul Tillich's assertion that God is the \\"ground of all being\\", Robinson wrote: \\"For it is in [Jesus] making himself nothing, in his utter self-surrender to others in love, that he discloses and lays bare the ground of man's being as Love ... For assertions about God are in the last analysis assertions about Love\\". While some of its ideas have been taken up by more liberal circles of Christian thought, proponents of the traditional interpretation of Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, reject Robinson's thesis as an unnecessary capitulation to Modernism. To what extent this is in fact the case depends very much on the frame of reference of the reader. However, the work of Robinson in Honest to God provided a departure point which would be followed up in the writings of the radical theologians Don Cupitt and John Shelby Spong and in the 1977 symposium The Myth of God Incarnate, edited by John Hick. Whether Robinson would have gone as far as Cupitt did in declaring the idea of God to be an entirely human creation is something which can only be conjectured. However, he said as he was dying that he \\"never doubted the essential truth of Christianity\\". Robinson seemed to rapidly become a person upon whom religious people projected their own ideas of what he was like, and the book The Honest to God Debate, edited by Robinson and by David L Edwards, also published in 1963, contains a mixture of articles which either praise Robinson for his approach or accuse him of atheism.Robinson, J. A. T. & Edwards, D. L. 1963 and 2012. The Honest to God Debate. London. SCM. =Redating the New Testament (1976)= Although Robinson was considered a liberal theologian, he challenged the work of like-minded colleagues in the field of exegetical criticism. Specifically, Robinson examined the reliability of the New Testament as he believed that it had been the subject of very little original research during the 20th century. He also wrote that past scholarship was based on a \\"tyranny of unexamined assumptions\\" and an \\"almost wilful blindness\\". Robinson concluded that much of the New Testament was written before AD 64, partly basing his judgement on the sparse textual evidence that the New Testament reflects knowledge of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70\\\\. In relation to the four gospels' dates of authorship, Robinson placed Matthew as being written sometime between AD 40 and the AD 60s, Mark sometime between AD 45 and AD 60, Luke sometime during the AD 50s and 60s and John sometime between AD 40 and AD 65 or later.. Robinson also argued that the letter of James was penned by a brother of Jesus Christ within twenty years of Jesus' death; that Paul authored all the books attributed to him; and that the \\"John\\" who wrote the fourth Gospel was the apostle John. Robinson also suggested that the results of his investigations implied a need to rewrite many theologies of the New Testament.... In a letter to Robinson, the New Testament scholar C. H. Dodd wrote, \\"I should agree with you that much of the late dating is quite arbitrary, even wanton[;] the offspring not of any argument that can be presented, but rather of the critic's prejudice that, if he appears to assent to the traditional position of the early church, he will be thought no better than a stick-in-the-mud.\\". Robinson's call for redating the New Testamentor, at least, the four gospelswas echoed in subsequent scholarship such as John Wenham's work Redating Matthew, Mark and Luke: A Fresh Assault on the Synoptic Problem and work by Claude Tresmontant, G√ºnther Zuntz, Carsten Peter Thiede, Eta Linnemann, Harold Riley, Jean Carmignac, and Bernard Orchard. Robinson's early dates for the gospels, especially those for John, have not been taken up among most modern scholars of Biblical historicism.Professor Bart D. Ehrman, The Historical Jesus, Part I, p. 6, The Teaching Company, 2000. Quote: \\"Scholars are fairly unanimous that they were written some decades after Jesus‚Äô death: Mark, AD 65‚Äì70; Matthew and Luke, AD 80‚Äì85; and John, AD 90‚Äì95.\\" Some conservative and traditionalist scholars, however, concur with his dating of the synoptic gospels.. =The Priority of John (1984)= In The Priority of John, Robinson furthered the argument put forward in Redating the New Testament that all the books were written before 70 AD, by focusing on the book that is placed early least often. He also wanted to prove that John is independent of the Synoptics and better than them at describing the length and time period of Jesus' ministry, Palestinian geography, and the cultural milieu of the early first century there. This work was put together posthumously by J. F. Coakley according to Robinson's basically complete but unfinished notes for his Bampton Lectures. Other Robinson was also noted for his 1960 court testimony against the censorship of Lady Chatterley's Lover, claiming that it was a book which \\"every Christian should read.\\"\\"Attempt To Portray Sex As Something Sacred ‚Äì Bishop A Witness For Defence\\",The Times, 28 October 1960; p. 6. Robinson's legacy includes the work of a now retired Episcopal bishop, John Shelby Spong, in best-selling books that include salutes by Spong to Robinson as a lifelong mentor. In a 2013 interview, Spong recalls reading Robinson's 1963 book: \\"I can remember reading his first book as if was yesterday. I was rather snobbish when the book came out. I actually refused to read it at first. Then, when I read it ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt stop. I read it three times! My theology was never the same. I had to wrestle with how I could take the literalism I had picked up in Sunday school and put it into these new categories.\\".

The United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) maintains a watchlist, pursuant to 49 USC ¬ß 114 (h)(2), of \\"individuals known to pose, or suspected of posing, a risk of air piracy or terrorism or a threat to airline or passenger safety.\\" The list is used to pre-emptively identify terrorists attempting to buy airline tickets or board aircraft traveling in the United States, and to mitigate perceived threats.  Overview  CAPPS systems rely on what is known as a passenger name record (PNR). When a person books a plane ticket, certain identifying information is collected by the airline: full name, address, etc. This information is used to check against some data store (e.g., a TSA No-Fly list, the FBI ten most wanted fugitive list, etc.) and assign a terrorism \\"risk score\\" to that person. High risk scores require the airline to subject the person to extended baggage and/or personal screening, and to contact law enforcement if necessary.  CAPPS I  CAPPS I was first implemented in the late 1990s, in response to the perceived threat of U.S. domestic and international terrorism. CAPPS I was administered by the FBI and FAA. CAPPS screening selected passengers for additional screening of their checked baggage for explosives. CAPPS selectees did not undergo any additional screening at passenger security checkpoints. = September 11, 2001, attacks = On the morning of the September 11 attacks, several of the hijackers were selected by CAPPS. Wail al-Shehri and Satam al- Suqami were selected for extra screening of their checked bags, before they boarded American Airlines Flight 11 at Logan International Airport. Waleed al- Shehri was also selected, but since he had checked no bags, CAPPS selection had no effect on him. Mohamed Atta was selected by CAPPS when he checked in at Portland International Jetport. All five of the hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77 were CAPPS selectees, with Hani Hanjour, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed chosen by the CAPPS criteria. Nawaf al-Hazmi and Salem al-Hazmi were selected because they did not provide adequate identification, and had their checked bags held until they boarded the aircraft. Ahmad al-Haznawi was the only hijacker selected of those on United Airlines Flight 93, and none of the hijackers of United Airlines Flight 175 were selected by CAPPS. =After 9/11= In November 2001, control was transferred to the TSA, where it has \\"... expanded almost daily as Intelligence Community (IC) agencies and the Office of Homeland Security continue to request the addition of individuals ...\\" In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) presented a proposal for an expanded system (CAPPS II), which was reviewed by Congress and later canceled by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System II was a proposal for a new CAPPS system, designed by the Office of National Risk Assessment (ONRA), a subsidiary office of the TSA, with the contracted assistance of Lockheed Martin. Congress presented the TSA with a list of requirements for a successor to CAPPS I. Some of those requirements were: * The government, not the airlines, would control and administer the system * Every ticketed passenger would be screened, not just those who check bags * Every airline and every airport would be covered by the system Like its predecessor, the CAPPS II proposal would rely on the PNR to uniquely identify people attempting to board aircraft. It would expand the PNR field to include a few extra fields, like a full street address, date of birth, and a home telephone number. It would then cross-reference these fields with government records and private sector databases to ascertain the identity of the person, and then determine a number of details about that person. Law enforcement would be contacted in the event that the person was either present on a terrorist or most-wanted list or had outstanding Federal or state arrest warrants for violent crime. Otherwise, the software would calculate a \\"risk score\\" and then print a code on the boarding pass indicating the appropriate \\"screening level\\" for that person: green (no threat) indicates no additional screening, yellow (unknown or possible threat) indicates additional screening, and red (high risk) indicates no boarding and deferral to law enforcement. Exactly how this risk score would be calculated was never disclosed nor subject to public oversight of any kind outside of the TSA. The CAPPS II system was criticized in a report by the United States General Accounting Office in early 2004, and faced increased opposition from watchdog groups like the ACLU, ReclaimDemocracy.org, and Electronic Privacy Information Center. These advocacy groups believed it would undermine both privacy and safety. They expressed concern that the system would be unconstitutional and that terrorists could use it to their advantage. CAPPS II was cancelled by the TSA in the summer of 2004. Shortly thereafter, the TSA announced a successor program, called Secure Flight, that would work much the same way as CAPPS II. TSA hoped to test Secure Flight in August 2005 using two airlines. Secure Flight has been blocked by Congress until the government can prove that the system can pass 10 tests for accuracy and privacy protection as follows: # Redress process - A system of due process exists whereby aviation passengers determined to pose a threat are either delayed or prohibited from boarding their scheduled flights by TSA may appeal such decisions and correct erroneous information contained in CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow- on/successor programs. # Accuracy of databases and effectiveness of Secure Flight - The underlying error rate of the government and private databases that will be used to both establish identity and assign a risk level to a passenger will not produce a large number of false positives that will result in a significant number of passengers being treated mistakenly or security resources being diverted. # Stress testing - TSA has stress-tested and demonstrated the efficacy and accuracy of all search technologies in CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs and has demonstrated that CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs can make an accurate predictive assessment of those passengers who may constitute a threat to aviation. # Internal oversight - The Secretary of Homeland Security has established an internal oversight board to monitor the manner in which CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs are being developed and prepared. # Operational safeguards - TSA has built in sufficient operational safeguards to reduce the opportunities for abuse. # Security measures - Substantial security measures are in place to protect CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs from unauthorized access by hackers or other intruders. # Oversight of system use and operation - TSA has adopted policies establishing effective oversight of the use and operation of the system. # Privacy concerns - There are no specific privacy concerns with the technological architecture of the system. # Modifications with respect to intrastate travel to accommodate states with unique air transportation needs - TSA has, in accordance with the requirements of section 44903 (j)(2)(B) of title 49, United States Code, modified CAPPS II or Secure Flight or other follow-on/successor programs with respect to intrastate transportation to accommodate states with unique air transportation needs and passengers who might otherwise regularly trigger primary selectee status. # Life-cycle cost estimates and expenditure plans - Appropriate life-cycle cost estimates, and expenditure and program plans exist.

He was a longtime professor of chemistry at Queen's University of Belfast. Life Andrews was born in Belfast, Ireland, where his father was a linen merchant. He attended the Belfast Academy and the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, where at the latter of which he studied mathematics under James Thomson. In 1828 he went to the University of Glasgow to study chemistry under Professor Thomas Thomson, then studied at Trinity College, Dublin, where he gained distinction in classics as well as in science. Finally, at University of Edinburgh in 1835, he was awarded a doctorate in medicine. Andrews began a successful medical practice in his native Belfast in 1835, also giving instruction in chemistry at the Academical Institution. In 1845 he was appointed vice-president of the newly established Queen's University of Belfast, and professor of chemistry there. He held these two offices until his retirement in 1879 at age 66. He died in 1885, and was buried in the Borough Cemetery in Belfast. In 1842, Andrews married Jane Hardie Walker (1818‚Äì1899). They had six children, including the geologist Mary Andrews. Work Andrews first became known as a scientific investigator with his work on the heat developed in chemical actions, for which the Royal Society awarded him a Royal Medal in 1844. Another important investigation, undertaken in collaboration with Peter Guthrie Tait, was devoted to ozone. His reputation mainly rests on his work with liquefaction of gases. In the 1860s he carried out a very complete inquiry into the gas laws--expressing the relations of pressure, temperature, and volume in carbon dioxide. In particular, he established the concepts of critical temperature and critical pressure, showing that a substance passes from vapor to liquid state without any breach of continuity.Andrews coined the term \\"critical point\\" in 1869 in: Andrews, Thomas (1869) \\"The Bakerian lecture: On the continuity of the gaseous and liquid states of matter,\\" Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (London), 159 : 575-590; the term \\"critical point\\" appears on page 588. In Andrews' experiments on phase transitions, he showed that carbon dioxide may be carried from any of the states we usually call liquid to any of those we usually call gas, without losing homogeneity. The mathematical physicist Willard Gibbs cited these results in support of the Gibbs free energy equation. They also set off a race among researchers to liquify various other gases. In 1877-78 Louis Paul Cailletet was the first to liquefy oxygen and nitrogen.

They have a large beak but lack the casque that is prominent in some other hornbill species. They are found mainly in dense forest and around rubber, arecanut or coffee plantations. They move around in pairs or small groups, feeding on figs and other forest fruits. Their loud cackling and laughing call makes them familiar to people living in the region. Description An adult male The Malabar grey hornbill is a large bird, but at in length it is still the smallest of the Asian hornbills. It has a tail and pale or yellowish to orange bill. Males have a reddish bill with a yellow tip, while the females have a plain yellow bill with black at the base of the lower mandible and a black stripe along the culmen. They show a broad whitish superciliary band above the eye, running down to the neck. They fly with a strong flap and glide flight and hop around heavily on the outer branches of large fruiting trees. They have brown-grey wings, a white carpal patch and black primary flight feathers tipped with white. The Indian grey hornbill, which is found mainly on the adjoining plains, is easily told apart by its prominent casque, and in flight by the white trailing edge of the entire wing. The Malabar grey hornbill has a grey back and a cinnamon vent. The long tail is blackish with a white tip, and the underparts are grey with white streaks. The long curved bill has no casque. Immature birds have browner upperparts and a yellow bill. Young birds have a dull white or yellow iris.

The species has an elevational distribution range from about 50 m near the coast (e.g., Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary, Maharashtra) to around 1,500 m in the mountains.Mudappa, D. & Raman, T. R. S. 2009. A conservation status survey of hornbills (Bucerotidae) in the Western Ghats, India. Indian Birds 5: 90‚Äì102. In the southern Western Ghats, Malabar Grey Hornbills were reported in evergreen forests between 500 m and 900 m (sporadically to 1,100 m) elevation in Kalakad ‚Äì Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, but frequently up to 1,200 m in the Anamalai Hills further north. In both these sites, the estimated Malabar Grey Hornbill density decreased with elevation, with the population density in rainforest fragments in the Anamalai Hills being additionally positively related to food tree species richness. The species is found mainly in dense forest habitats; the thinner dry forest habitat of the plains is typically occupied by the Indian grey hornbill. The Sri Lanka grey hornbill was included with this species in the past, but is now considered distinct. =Behaviour and ecology= This hornbill is found in small groups mainly in habitats with good tree cover. Being large frugivores, they are important as seed dispersal agents for many species of fruit bearing forest trees. They also feed on small vertebrates and in captivity they will readily take meat. =Breeding= Molem, Goa, India Nov 1997 The breeding season is January to May. Being secondary cavity nesters (incapable of excavating their own nests), they find trees with large cavities. A study in the Anaimalai Hills showed that the species preferred nest sites that had large trees. The nest holes were usually found in large trees with hollows caused by heart-rot, where a branch had broken off. Trees of the species Lagerstroemia microcarpa, Terminalia bellirica and Terminalia crenulata were found to hold nearly 70% of all the nests in the Mudumalai area. The species is monogamous, and the same nest sites are used by the pair year after year. The female incarcerates herself within the cavity by sealing its entrance with a cement made from her droppings. The female then lays three or sometimes four white eggs and begins a complete moult of her flight feathers. The entrance to the nest retains a narrow aperture through which the female voids excreta and receives food from the male. The male brings all the food needed for the female and the young. Berries, insects, small rodents and reptiles are included in the diet. Males tap the tree to beckon the female on arriving with food. Berries are regurgitated one at a time and shifted to the tip of the bill before being passed to the female.

This results in a file larger than a normal one-architecture binary file, thus the name. The usual method of implementation is to include a version of the machine code for each instruction set, preceded by a single entry point with code compatible with all operating systems, which executes a jump to the appropriate section. Alternative implementations store different executables in different forks, each with its own entry point that is directly used by the operating system. The use of fat binaries is not common in operating system software; there are several alternatives to solve the same problem, such as the use of an installer program to choose an architecture-specific binary at install time (such as with Android multiple APKs), selecting an architecture- specific binary at runtime (such as with Plan 9's union directories and GNUstep's fat bundles), distributing software in source code form and compiling it in-place, or the use of a virtual machine (such as with Java) and Just In Time compilation.

This was achieved by packaging both a 68000-compiled version and a PowerPC-compiled version of the same program into their executable files. The older 68K code (CFM-68K or classic 68K) continued to be stored in the resource fork, while the newer PowerPC code was contained in the data fork, in PEF format. Fat binaries were larger than programs supporting only the PowerPC or 68k, which led to the creation of a number of utilities that would strip out the unneeded version. In the era of small hard drives, when 80 MB hard drives were a common size, these utilities were sometimes useful, as program code was generally a large percentage of overall drive usage, and stripping the unneeded members of a fat binary would free up a significant amount of space on a hard drive. =NeXT's/Apple's multi- architecture binaries= NeXTSTEP Multi-Architecture Binaries Fat binaries were a feature of NeXT's NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP operating system, starting with NeXTSTEP 3.1. In NeXTSTEP, they were called \\"Multi-Architecture Binaries\\". Multi-Architecture Binaries were originally intended to allow software to be compiled to run both on NeXT's Motorola 68k-based hardware and on Intel IA-32-based PCs running NeXTSTEP, with a single binary file for both platforms. It was later used to allow OPENSTEP applications to run on PCs and the various RISC platforms OPENSTEP supported. Multi-Architecture Binary files are in a special archive format, in which a single file stores one or more Mach-O subfiles for each architecture supported by the Multi-Architecture Binary. Every Multi-Architecture Binary starts with a structure (struct fat_header) containing two unsigned integers. The first integer (\\"magic\\") is used as a magic number to identify this file as a Fat Binary. The second integer (\\"nfat_arch\\") defines how many Mach-O Files the archive contains (how many instances of the same program for different architectures). After this header, there are nfat_arch number of fat_arch structures (struct fat_arch). This structure defines the offset (from the start of the file) at which to find the file, the alignment, the size and the CPU type and subtype which the Mach-O binary (within the archive) is targeted at. The version of the GNU Compiler Collection shipped with the Developer Tools was able to cross-compile source code for the different architectures on which NeXTStep was able to run. For example, it was possible to choose the target architectures with multiple '-arch' options (with the architecture as argument). This was a convenient way to distribute a program for NeXTStep running on different architectures. It was also possible to create libraries (e.g. using libtool) with different targeted object files. Mach-O and Mac OS X Apple Computer acquired NeXT in 1996 and continued to work with the OPENSTEP code. Mach-O became the native object file format in Apple's free Darwin operating system (2000) and Apple's Mac OS X (2001), and NeXT's Multi-Architecture Binaries continued to be supported by the operating system. Under Mac OS X, Multi-Architecture Binaries can be used to support multiple variants of an architecture, for instance to have different versions of 32-bit code optimized for the PowerPC G3, PowerPC G4, and PowerPC 970 generations of processors. It can also be used to support multiple architectures, such as 32-bit and 64-bit PowerPC or PowerPC and x86. Apple's Universal binary Apple Universal binary logo In 2005, Apple announced another transition, from PowerPC processors to Intel x86 processors. Apple promoted the distribution of new applications that support both PowerPC and x86 natively by using executable files in Multi- Architecture Binary format. Apple calls such programs \\"Universal applications\\" and calls the file format \\"Universal binary\\" as perhaps a way to distinguish this new transition from the previous transition, or other uses of Multi- Architecture Binary format. Universal binary format was not necessary for forward migration of pre-existing native PowerPC applications; from 2006 to 2011, Apple supplied Rosetta, a PowerPC (PPC)-to-x86 dynamic binary translator, to play this role. However, Rosetta had a fairly steep performance overhead, so developers were encouraged to offer both PPC and Intel binaries, using Universal binaries. The obvious cost of Universal binary is that every installed executable file is larger, but in the years since the release of the PPC, hard-drive space has greatly outstripped executable size; while a Universal binary might be double the size of a single-platform version of the same application, free-space resources generally dwarf the code size, which becomes a minor issue. In fact, often a Universal-binary application will be smaller than two single-architecture applications because program resources can be shared rather than duplicated. If not all of the architectures are required, the and command-line applications can be used to remove versions from the Multi-Architecture Binary image, thereby creating what is sometimes called a thin binary. In addition, Multi-Architecture Binary executables can contain code for both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of PowerPC and x86, allowing applications to be shipped in a form that supports 32-bit processors but that makes use of the larger address space and wider data paths when run on 64-bit processors. In versions of the Xcode development environment from 2.1 through 3.2 (running on Mac OS X 10.4 through Mac OS X 10.6), Apple included utilities which allowed applications to be targeted for both Intel and PowerPC architecture; universal binaries could eventually contain up to four versions of the executable code (32-bit PowerPC, 32-bit x86, 64-bit PowerPC, and 64-bit x86). However, PowerPC support was removed from Xcode 4.0 and is therefore not available to developers running Mac OS X 10.7 or greater. In 2020, Apple announced another transition, this time from Intel x86 processors to Apple silicon. To smooth the transition Apple added support for the Universal 2 binary format. This allows the creation of binaries that run natively on both 64-bit Intel and 64-bit Apple silicon (an Aarch64 variant). DOS =Combined COM-style binaries for CP/M-80 and DOS= CP/M-80, MP/M-80, Concurrent CP/M, CP/M Plus and Personal CP/M-80 executables for the Intel 8080 (and Z80) processor families use the same .COM file extension as DOS- compatible operating systems for Intel 8086 binaries. In both cases programs are loaded at offset +100h and executed by jumping to the first byte in the file. As the opcodes of the two processor families are not compatible, attempting to start a program under the wrong operating system leads to incorrect and unpredictable behaviour. In order to avoid this, some methods have been devised to build fat binaries which contain both a CP/M-80 and a DOS program, preceded by initial code which is interpreted correctly on both platforms. The methods either combine two fully functional programs each built for their corresponding environment, or add stubs which cause the program to exit gracefully if started on the wrong processor. For this to work, the first few instructions in the .COM file have to be valid code for both 8086 and 8080 processors, which would cause the processors to branch into different locations within the code. For example, the utilities in Simeon Cran's emulator MyZ80 start with the opcode sequence . An 8086 sees this as a jump and reads its next instruction from offset +154h whereas an 8080 or compatible processor goes straight through and reads its next instruction from +103h. A similar sequence used for this purpose is . Another method to keep a DOS- compatible operating system from erroneously executing .COM programs for CP/M-80 and MSX-DOS machines is to start the 8080 code with , which is decoded as a \\"RET\\" instruction by x86 processors, thereby gracefully exiting the program, while it will be decoded as \\"JP 103h\\" instruction by 8080 processors and simply jump to the next instruction in the program. Some CP/M-80 3.0 .COM files may have one or more RSX overlays attached to them by GENCOM. If so, they start with an extra 256-byte header (one page). In order to indicate this, the first byte in the header is set to , which works both as a signature identifying this type of COM file to the CP/M 3.0 executable loader, as well as a \\"RET\\" instruction for 8080-compatible processors which leads to a graceful exit if the file is executed under older versions of CP/M-80. is never appropriate as the first byte of a program for any x86 processor (it has different meanings for different generations, but is never a meaningful first byte); the executable loader in some versions of DOS rejects COM files that start with , avoiding incorrect operation. =Combined binaries for CP/M-86 and DOS= CP/M-86 and DOS do not share a common file extension for executables. Thus, it is not normally possible to confuse executables. However, early versions of DOS had so much in common with CP/M in terms of its architecture that some early DOS programs were developed to share binaries containing executable code. One program known to do this was WordStar 3.2x, which used identical overlay files in their ports for CP/M-86 and MS-DOS, and used dynamically fixed-up code to adapt to the differing calling conventions of these operating systems at runtime. Digital Research's GSX for CP/M-86 and DOS also shares binary identical 16-bit drivers. =Combined COM and SYS files= DOS device drivers start with a file header whose first four bytes are FFFFFFFFh by convention, although this is not a requirement. This is fixed up dynamically by the operating system when the driver loads (typically in the DOS BIOS when it executes DEVICE statements in CONFIG.SYS). Since DOS does not reject files with a .COM extension to be loaded per DEVICE and does not test for FFFFFFFFh, it is possible to combine a COM program and a device driver into the same file by placing a jump instruction to the entry point of the embedded COM program within the first four bytes of the file (three bytes are usually sufficient). If the embedded program and the device driver sections share a common portion of code, or data, it is necessary for the code to deal with being loaded at offset +0100h as a .COM style program, and at +0000h as a device driver. For shared code loaded at the \\"wrong\\" offset but not designed to be position-independent, this requires an internal address fix-up similar to what would otherwise already have been carried out by a relocating loader, except for that in this case it has to be done by the loaded program itself; this is similar to the situation with self-relocating drivers but with the program already loaded at the target location by the operating system's loader. =Crash-protected system files= Under DOS, some files, by convention, have file extensions which do not reflect their actual file type. For example, COUNTRY.SYS is not a DOS device driver, but a binary NLS database file for use with the CONFIG.SYS COUNTRY directive and the NLSFUNC driver. The PC DOS and DR-DOS system files IBMBIO.COM and IBMDOS.COM are special binary images, not COM-style programs. Trying to load COUNTRY.SYS with a DEVICE statement or executing IBMBIO.COM or IBMDOS.COM at the command prompt will cause unpredictable results. It is sometimes possible to avoid this by utilizing techniques similar to those described above. For example, DR-DOS 7.02 and higher incorporate a safety feature developed by Matthias R. Paul: If these files are called inappropriately, tiny embedded stubs will just display some file version information and exit gracefully. A similar protection feature was the 8080 instruction (\\"RST 0\\") at the very start of Z-System language overlay files, which would result in a warm start (instead of a crash) under CP/M-80 if loaded inappropriately. In a remotely similar fashion, many (binary) file formats by convention include a byte (ASCII ^Z) near the beginning of the file. This control character will be interpreted as \\"soft\\" end-of-file (EOF) marker when a file is opened in non-binary mode, and thus, under many operating systems (including RT-11, VMS, CP/M, DOS, and Windows), it prevents \\"binary garbage\\" from being displayed when a file is accidentally typed at the console. Linux =FatELF: Universal binaries for Linux= FatELF logo FatELF is a fat binary implementation for Linux and other Unix- like operating systems. Technically, a FatELF binary is a concatenation of ELF binaries with some meta data indicating which binary to use on what architecture. Additionally to the CPU architecture abstraction (byte order, word size, CPU instruction set, etc.), there is the advantage of binaries with support for multiple kernel ABIs and versions. FatELF has several use-cases, according to developers: * Distributions no longer need to have separate downloads for various platforms. * Separated /lib, /lib32 and /lib64 trees are not required anymore in OS directory structure. * The correct binary and libraries are centrally chosen by the system instead of shell scripts. * If the ELF ABI changes someday, legacy users can be still supported. * Distribution of web browser plug ins that work out of the box with multiple platforms. * Distribution of one application file that works across Linux and BSD OS variants, without a platform compatibility layer on them. * One hard drive partition can be booted on different machines with different CPU architectures, for development and experimentation. Same root file system, different kernel and CPU architecture. * Applications provided by network share or USB sticks, will work on multiple systems. This is also helpful for creating portable applications and also cloud computing images for heterogeneous systems. A proof-of-concept Ubuntu 9.04 image is available. , FatELF has not been integrated into the mainline Linux kernel. Windows =Fatpack= Although the Portable Executable format used by Windows does not allow assigning code to platforms, it is still possible to make a loader program that dispatches based on architecture. This is because desktop versions of Windows on ARM has support for 32-bit x86 emulation, making it a useful \\"universal\\" machine code target. Fatpack is a loader that demonstrate the concept: it includes a 32-bit x86 program that tries to run the executables packed into its resource sections one by one. Similar systems The following approaches are similar to fat binaries in that multiple versions of machine code of the same purpose are provided in the same file. =Fat objects= GCC and LLVM do not have a fat binary format, but they do have fat object files for link-time optimization (LTO). Since LTO involves delaying the compilation to link-time, the object files must store the intermediate representation, but on the other hand machine code may need to be stored too (for speed or compatibility). An LTO object containing both IR and machine code is known as a fat object. =Function multi-versioning= Even in a program or library intended for the same instruction set architecture, a programmer may wish to make use of some newer instruction set extensions while keeping compatibility with an older CPU. This can be achieved with function multi-versioning (FMV): versions of the same function are written into the program, and a piece of code decides which one to use by detecting the CPU's capabilities (such as through CPUID). Intel C++ Compiler, GNU Compiler Collection, and LLVM all have the ability to automatically generate multi- versioned functions. This is a form of dynamic dispatch without any semantic effects. Many math libraries feature hand-written assembly routines that are automatically chosen according to CPU capability. Examples include glibc, Intel MKL, and OpenBLAS. In addition, the library loader in glibc supports loading from alternative paths for specific CPU features.

It is located in the City of Playford. History The town takes its name from the 'One Tree Hill Inn' (licensed in 1851), for many years the meeting place of the District Council of Munno Para. The inn's name, in turn, referred to a giant red gum tree which stood on the intersection of Black Top Road and Walters Road.The Manning Index of South Australian History - One Tree Hill retrieved 22 March 2013 The tree burnt down in 1890 and was cut down in 1934 and replaced with 5 trees which can still be seen today. =Aboriginal History= The Kaurna people were the indigenous inhabitants of the Adelaide region, which includes One Tree Hill. The Peramangk people, living further inland, visited the area from time to time, chiefly in the warmer parts of the year. This was due to the area being cooler and better watered than the plains. The hills at this time were well wooded with tree species that had been in the area for around 6000 years. Along the rivers and creeks and wide valleys could be found tall, heavy eucalypts, many of which had wide, hollowed bases large enough for the Aboriginals to use as shelters. There were many such shelter trees in use by the Kaurna and Peramangk as late as the 1840s, and evidence exists that they hunted and gathered in the woodlands and grasslands for many generations prior to European settlement. Unfortunately, the community declined soon after European settlement, and most of what we know about them today comes from the few artifacts and sparse archaeological evidence that they left behind. =European settlement= Europeans settled the area in the early 1840s, and the township commenced in 1851 with the building of the One Tree Hill Inn. The settlement was located in a strategic location, being close to several larger towns (such as Gawler and Salisbury) with facilities, and became the meeting place of the surrounding rural community, including Gould Creek and Uleybury. A post office and general store were built in 1858 which featured a large cellar where produce including local wine was sold. In 1906, the Institute, which cost about ¬£600, was built across the road from the post office, and became a town meeting place and recreation centre, which was expanded considerably in 1978. One Tree Hill Post Office opened on 19 May 1857. Demographics The 2006 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 1,268 persons in One Tree Hill on census night. Of these, 52.4% were male and 47.6% were female. The majority of residents (71.2%) are of Australian birth, with 14.8% born in England. The age distribution of One Tree Hill residents is comparable to that of the greater Australian population. 63.7% of residents were over 25 years in 2006, compared to the Australian average of 66.5%; and 36.3% were younger than 25 years, compared to the Australian average of 33.5%. Community The township has one primary school and several historic primary school buildings: Precolumb School (1855-1938), Uley School (1856 to 1971, now the Uleybury School Museum). In 1972 the current primary school was built on McGilp Road. One Tree Hill has an Institute Hall built 1906 and Uniting Church built 1867 (originally Methodist) and many historic buildings. The township has a small shopping centre and a hotel named the Blacksmiths Inn. Attractions =Parks= The Para Wirra Conservation Park is north-east of the town.Para Wirra Recreation Park retrieved 22 March 2013 Transport There is no specific provision for bicycles on any of the local roads. There are footpaths on most roads within the town and along Black Top Road in some sections up three kilometres west of the town using land from the old alignment of the road. =Roads= The town is serviced by the following main roads: * Black Top Road to Adelaide and Salisbury * Yorktown Road to Elizabeth * Gawler - Kersbrook Road to Kersbrook, Gawler and Williamstown * One Tree Hill Road to Golden Grove =Public transport= The area is not serviced by Adelaide public transport; the nearest service is an Adelaide Metro bus route at Craigmore, five kilometres to the west of the town. From the commencement of a Bowman's bus service around 1937 until Friday 14 May 1982, a daily bus service ran from the township to Adelaide via Golden Grove and North East Road (Route 540E). Before that the nearest transport was at Smithfield Railway Station.

There is an elaborate theory of what these equations should be, much of which is still conjectural.  Introduction  A prototypical example, the Riemann zeta function has a functional equation relating its value at the complex number s with its value at 1 ‚àí s. In every case this relates to some value Œ∂(s) that is only defined by analytic continuation from the infinite series definition. That is, writingas is conventionalœÉ for the real part of s, the functional equation relates the cases :œÉ > 1 and œÉ < 0, and also changes a case with :0 < œÉ < 1 in the critical strip to another such case, reflected in the line œÉ = ¬Ω. Therefore, use of the functional equation is basic, in order to study the zeta-function in the whole complex plane. The functional equation in question for the Riemann zeta function takes the simple form :Z(s) = Z(1-s) \\\\, where Z(s) is Œ∂(s) multiplied by a gamma-factor, involving the gamma function. This is now read as an 'extra' factor in the Euler product for the zeta-function, corresponding to the infinite prime. Just the same shape of functional equation holds for the Dedekind zeta function of a number field K, with an appropriate gamma-factor that depends only on the embeddings of K (in algebraic terms, on the tensor product of K with the real field). There is a similar equation for the Dirichlet L-functions, but this time relating them in pairs: :\\\\Lambda(s,\\\\chi)=\\\\varepsilon\\\\Lambda(1-s,\\\\chi^*) with œá a primitive Dirichlet character, œá* its complex conjugate, Œõ the L-function multiplied by a gamma-factor, and Œµ a complex number of absolute value 1, of shape :G(\\\\chi) \\\\over {\\\\left G(\\\\chi)\\\\right \\\\vert} where G(œá) is a Gauss sum formed from œá. This equation has the same function on both sides if and only if œá is a real character, taking values in {0,1,‚àí1}. Then Œµ must be 1 or ‚àí1, and the case of the value ‚àí1 would imply a zero of Œõ(s) at s = ¬Ω. According to the theory (of Gauss, in effect) of Gauss sums, the value is always 1, so no such simple zero can exist (the function is even about the point).  Theory of functional equations  A unified theory of such functional equations was given by Erich Hecke, and the theory was taken up again in Tate's thesis by John Tate. Hecke found generalised characters of number fields, now called Hecke characters, for which his proof (based on theta functions) also worked. These characters and their associated L-functions are now understood to be strictly related to complex multiplication, as the Dirichlet characters are to cyclotomic fields. There are also functional equations for the local zeta-functions, arising at a fundamental level for the (analogue of) Poincar√© duality in √©tale cohomology. The Euler products of the Hasse‚ÄìWeil zeta-function for an algebraic variety V over a number field K, formed by reducing modulo prime ideals to get local zeta-functions, are conjectured to have a global functional equation; but this is currently considered out of reach except in special cases. The definition can be read directly out of √©tale cohomology theory, again; but in general some assumption coming from automorphic representation theory seems required to get the functional equation. The Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture was a particular case of this as general theory. By relating the gamma-factor aspect to Hodge theory, and detailed studies of the expected Œµ factor, the theory as empirical has been brought to quite a refined state, even if proofs are missing.

The first stellar occultation was observed on August 17, 1979, from the Gissar and Alma-Ata observatories produced two chords which were used to estimate a diameter of 150 km for the asteroid. This is close to the present-day estimate of 147.9 km. Since then 51 Nemausa has been observed 20 times in stellar occultation. Light curve inversion model DAMIT 1065 is a good match to a seven-chord occultation observed on 3rd September 2016, from which an equivalent Volume mean diameter of 146.4km, and an equivalent Surface mean diameter of 150.3 km was obtained. Lightcurve data suggests that it may have a small moon.Other reports of asteroid/TNO companions Nemausa has been studied by radar.

Prior to 1997, stilbite was recognized as a mineral species, but a reclassification in 1997 by the International Mineralogical Association changed it to a series name, with the mineral species being named: * stilbite- Ca * stilbite-Na Stilbite-Ca, by far the more common of the two, is a hydrous calcium sodium and aluminium silicate, NaCa4(Si27Al9)O72¬∑28(H2O). In the case of stilbite-Na, sodium dominates over calcium. The species are visually indistinguishable, and the series name stilbite is still used whenever testing has not been performed.  History  At one time heulandite and stilbite were considered to be identical minerals. After they were found to be two separate species, in 1818, the name desmine (\\"a bundle\\") was proposed for stilbite, and this name is still employed in Germany. The English name \\"stilbite\\" is from the Greek stilbein = to shine, because of the pearly luster of the {010} faces.  Chemistry and related species  Stilbite shows a wide variation in exchangeable cations: silicon and aluminium ions occupy equivalent sites and can substitute for each other. Since silicon and aluminium have a different charge (Si4+ and Al3+) the ions occupying the sodium/calcium site have to adjust to maintain charge balance. There is a continuous series between stellerite, whose formula can be written as Ca4(Si28Al8)O72¬∑28(H2O), and stilbite, and another continuous series between stilbite and barrerite, Na8(Si28Al8)O72¬∑26(H2O). Epistilbite is a distinct zeolite species unrelated to stilbite.  Crystal class  Stilbite is usually monoclinic 2/m, meaning that it has one twofold axis of rotational symmetry perpendicular to a mirror plane. The twofold axis is the crystal axis b, and the a and c crystal axes lie in the mirror plane. For a monoclinic crystal a and c are inclined to each other at an angle Œ≤ which is not a right angle. For stilbite Œ≤ is nearly 130¬∞. Stilbite crystals, however, appear to be almost orthorhombic, and a larger unit cell can be chosen, containing two formula units (Z = 2) such that resembles an orthorhombic cell, with all three crystal axes very nearly mutually perpendicular. The mineral is said to be pseudo-orthorhombic. Non- endmember forms of stilbite may be triclinic or even truly orthorhombic, indeed the framework can have symmetry ranging from orthorhombic to triclinic in a single crystal.  Habit  Crystals are typically thin tabular, flattened parallel to the dominant cleavage and elongated along the an axis. Aggregates may be sheaf-like or in bow-ties, also fibrous and globular. Twinning, cruciform and penetration, is extremely common on {001}.  Physical and optical properties  The color is usually colorless or white, also yellow, brown, pink, salmon, orange, red, green, blue or black. The luster is generally vitreous, and on the perfect cleavage parallel to the plane of symmetry it is markedly pearly. The streak is white and crystals are transparent to translucent. The hardness is to 4 and the specific gravity 2.12 to 2.22. Cleavage is perfect on {010}, poor on {001}. The mineral is brittle, with a conchoidal or uneven fracture. It is not radioactive. Stilbite is biaxial (-) with refractive indices: *Nx = 1.479 to 1.492, Ny = 1.485 to 1.500, Nz = 1.489 to 1.505 *Nx = 1.484 to 1.500, Ny = 1.492 to 1.507, Nz = 1.494 to 1.513  Unit cell and structure Where sources give cell parameters for stilbite-Na, they are the same as those for stilbite-Ca. The unit cell can be considered as a monoclinic cell with Œ≤ close to 130¬∞ and one formula unit per unit cell (Z = 1), or as a larger pseudo-orthorhombic cell with Œ≤ close to 90¬∞ and Z = 2. Cell Parameters for the monoclinic cell: *a = 13.595 to 13.69 √Ö, b = 18.197 to 18.31 √Ö, c = 11.265 to 11.30 √Ö, Œ≤ = 127.94 to 128.1¬∞ *a = 13.63 √Ö, b = 18.17 √Ö, c = 11.31 √Ö, Œ≤ = 129.166¬∞ *a = 13.60 to 13.69 √Ö, b = 18.20 to 18.31 √Ö, c = 11.27 √Ö, Œ≤ = 128¬∞ Cell parameters for the pseudo-orthorhombic cell: *a = 13.595 to 13.69 √Ö, b = 18.197 to 18.31 √Ö, c = 17.775 to 17.86 √Ö, Œ≤ = 90.00 to 90.91¬∞ *a = 13.595 to 13.657 √Ö, b = 18.197 to 18.309 √Ö, c = 17.775 to 17.842 √Ö, Œ≤ = 90:05 to 90.91¬∞ (Z is doubled to Z = 4 because the formula unit halved to NaCa2Al5Si13O36.14H2O) *a=13.69 √Ö, b=18.25 √Ö, c=11.31 √Ö, Œ≤ =128.2¬∞American Mineralogist (1970) 55: 387‚Äì397 *a = 13.60 to 13.69 √Ö, b = 18.20 to 18.31 √Ö, c = 17.78 to 17.86 √Ö, Œ≤ = 90.0 to 90.91¬∞ The framework of stilbite is pseudo- orthorhombic with the open channels typical of zeolites. It has 10-member rings and 8-member rings forming channels parallel to a and pseudo- orthorhombic c respectively.  Uses  The open channels in the stilbite structure act like a molecular sieve, enabling it to separate hydrocarbons in the process of petroleum refining.  Environment  Stilbite is a low- temperature secondary hydrothermal mineral. It occurs in the amygdaloidal cavities of basaltic volcanic rocks, in andesites, gneiss and hydrothermal veins. It also forms in hot springs deposits, and as a cementing agent in some sandstones and conglomerates. Stilbite has not been found in sedimentary tuff deposits or deep-sea deposits. Associated minerals are other zeolites, prehnite, calcite and quartz.  Localities  Stilbite is abundant in the volcanic rocks of Iceland, Faroe Islands, Isle of Skye, Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia (where it is the provincial mineral), northern New Jersey and North Carolina. Salmon-pink crystals occur with pale green apophyllite in the Deccan Traps near Mumbai (Bombay) and Pune, India; white sheaf-like groups encrust the calcite (Iceland-spar) of Berufjord near Djupivogr in Iceland; brown sheafs are found near Paterson, New Jersey in the United States; and crystals of a brick-red color are found at Old Kilpatrick, Scotland. Iceland is generally considered to be the type locality for stilbite-Ca. It is presumed to be the Helgusta Iceland Spar Mine, along Reydarfjordur. Excellent white bow ties of stilbite are found here on calcite and quartz, associated with heulandite and laumontite in cavities. The type locality for stilbite-Na is Cape Pula, Pula, Cagliari Province, Sardinia, Italy. Small, lustrous, white or pink, pointed blades of stilbite-Na, and formless masses, up to 5 cm in diameter, have been found there, covering a thin crust of reddish heulandite in large fractures and cavities in the highly weathered volcanic andesite or rhyolite. The Tertiary Deccan basalts of western India are the most prolific sources of stilbite in the world. Stilbite is the most abundant zeolite in the tholeiitic basalt plateaux near Nasik and Pune and decreases in abundance toward the coast at Mumbai.

A former New York Times correspondent, he has published several books, and currently writes for several newspapers and news agencies. Reporting career During the 1980s, Kinzer covered revolutions and social upheaval in Central America, and wrote his first book, Bitter Fruit, about military coups and destabilization in Guatemala during the 1950s. In 1990, The New York Times appointed Kinzer to head its Berlin bureau, from which he covered Eastern and Central Europe as they emerged from Soviet bloc. Kinzer was The New York Times chief in the newly established bureau in Istanbul (Turkey) from 1996 to 2000. Upon returning to the United States, Kinzer became the newspaper's culture correspondent, based in Chicago, as well as teaching at Northwestern University. Kinzer then took up residence in Boston and began teaching journalism and United States foreign policy at Boston University. He has written several non-fiction books about Turkey, Central America, Iran, and the US overthrow of foreign governments from the late 19th century to the present, as well as Rwanda's recovery from genocide. Kinzer also contributes columns to The New York Review of Books, The Guardian, and The Boston Globe. He is a Senior Fellow in International and Public Affairs at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University. Views Kinzer's reporting on Central America was criticized by Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky in their book Manufacturing Consent (1988), which cited Edgar Chamorro (\\"selected by the CIA as press spokesman for the contras\\") in his interview by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting describing Kinzer as: In chapter two of Manufacturing Consent, Kinzer is criticized for deploying no skepticism in his coverage of the murders of GAM (mutual support group) leaders in Guatemala and for \\"generally employ[ing] an apologetic framework\\" for the Guatemalan military state: Chomsky later expanded on this in an interview published in the 2002 collection Understanding Power: Kinzer has since that time criticized what he regards as an interventionist foreign policy of the United States toward Latin America and more recently the Middle East.Interview about the United States and Iran, Democracy Now!, March 3, 2008 (video, audio, and print transcript) In Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq, published in 2006, Kinzer critiqued U.S. foreign policy as overly interventionist. In a 2010 interview with Imagineer Magazine, he stated: In his 2008 book A Thousand Hills: Rwanda's Rebirth and the Man who Dreamed It, Kinzer credits President Paul Kagame for what he describes as the peace, development, and stability in Rwanda in the years after the Rwandan genocide, and criticizes the leaders of Rwanda before the genocide, such as Juvenal Habyarimana. In an opinion piece, he wrote in 2016 that Aleppo had been liberated from the violent militants who had ruled it for three years, but were liberated by Assad's forces. However, the American public was told \\"convoluted nonsense\\" about the war. He further noted: \\"At the recent debate in Milwaukee, Hillary Clinton claimed that United Nations peace efforts in Syria were based on \\"an agreement I negotiated in June of 2012 in Geneva.\\" The precise opposite is true. In 2012 Secretary of State Clinton joined Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Israel in a successful effort to kill Kofi Annan's UN peace plan because it would have accommodated Iran and kept Assad in power, at least temporarily. No one on the Milwaukee stage knew enough to challenge her.\\"The media are misleading the public on Syria, February 18, 2016, The Boston Globe Secretary Clinton was referencing the Geneva I Conference on Syria, during which principles and guidelines for a power transition were agreed to by the major powers.

He was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and was educated at the University of Melbourne. He was a public servant, social planner, and administrator before entering politics. He was an adviser to Clyde Holding, a former Victorian opposition leader and a minister in the Hawke government from 1983 until 1988. Sercombe was a member of the Essendon City Council in 1983 and 1984. Sercombe was the Member for Niddrie in the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1988 until 1996. He was Deputy Leader of the Opposition 1993‚Äì94 and a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1992‚Äì94. In State politics, he became well known for supporting a leadership challenge on behalf of Ian Baker who attempted to topple then Leader John Brumby in 1994. After the bid failed, he did not contest the deputy leadership. In the federal Parliament, Sercombe was an Opposition Whip from 1998 until 2001. He was elected to the Opposition Shadow Ministry after the 2004 election and appointed Shadow Minister for Pacific Islands (assisting the Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd). His portfolio responsibilities were expanded some time later by Beazley to include Overseas Development. As Shadow Minister, Sercombe put out a series of policy announcements about expanding Australia's relationship with that region. Within the Labor Party, Sercombe was for many years a leading member of the Labor Right in Victoria, although later became allied to the Left faction in Victoria while being a leading light of the Centre caucus in Canberra. Just prior to a local vote of ALP members, in February 2005 Sercombe announced he was withdrawing his candidacy from Labor preselection for his seat of Maribyrnong in favour of Australian Workers' Union National Secretary Bill Shorten as Shorten had the numbers over Sercombe to win the preselection and Shorten was elected unopposed as a result. He criticised challenges to other incumbent MPs. Despite announcing his retirement Sercombe was kept on the frontbench by Opposition Leader Kim Beazley until December 2006 when he was sacked by new leader Kevin Rudd. Sercombe was an Opposition frontbencher in both the Victorian State and Federal Parliaments but did not become a Minister in either tier of Government.

Each satellite is a high-density passive laser reflector in a very stable medium Earth orbit (MEO).  Function and operation  The spacecraft are aluminum-covered brass spheres with diameters of and masses of , covered with 426 cube-corner retroreflectors, giving them the appearance of giant golf balls.Kramer, Herbert J. (2013) Observation of the Earth and its Environment: Survey of Missions and Sensors Springer p149LAGEOS Characteristics NASA Historical Data Book Volume III Table 4-166 SP-4012 Of these retroreflectors, 422 are made from fused silica glass while the remaining 4 are made from germanium to obtain measurements in the infrared for experimental studies of reflectivity and satellite orientation. They have no on-board sensors or electronics, and are not attitude-controlled. They orbit at an altitude of , well above low earth orbit and well below geostationary orbit, at orbital inclinations of 109.8 and 52.6 degrees. Measurements are made by transmitting pulsed laser beams from Earth ground stations to the satellites. The laser beams then return to Earth after hitting the reflecting surfaces; the travel times are precisely measured, permitting ground stations in different parts of the Earth to measure their separations to better than one inch in thousands of miles. The LAGEOS satellites make it possible to determine positions of points on the Earth with extremely high accuracy due to the stability of their orbits. The high mass-to-area ratio and the precise, stable (attitude-independent) geometry of the LAGEOS spacecraft, together with their extremely regular orbits, make these satellites the most precise position references available.  Mission goals  The LAGEOS plaque, designed by Carl Sagan The LAGEOS mission consists of the following key goals: * Provide an accurate measurement of the satellite's position with respect to Earth. * Determine the planet's shape (geoid). * Determine tectonic plate movements associated with continental drift. Ground tracking stations located in many countries (including the US, Mexico, France, Germany, Poland, Australia, Egypt, China, Peru, Italy, and Japan) have ranged to the satellites and data from these stations are available worldwide to investigators studying crustal dynamics. There are two LAGEOS spacecraft, LAGEOS-1 launched in 1976, and LAGEOS-2 launched in 1992. , both LAGEOS spacecraft are routinely tracked by the ILRS network.

In 2011, Sidebottom was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. He was defeated for a second time at the 2013 election, with a swing of 10% against him. Background and early career Sidebottom was born in Hobart, Tasmania. He graduated from the University of Tasmania with a Bachelor of Arts (honours); and was a senior secondary college teacher between 1975 and 1997. During 1998, he was an electorate officer for Senator Nick Sherry and again worked for Sherry as an advisor between 2004 and 2007. Sidebottom was elected as a Councillor of the Central Coast Council, serving between 1996 and 1998. Political career At the 1998 federal election, Sidebottom defeated sitting Liberal Member for Braddon, Chris Miles. However, Sidebottom was defeated by the Liberal candidate, Mark Baker, at the 2004 election. Many put this down to concern about loss of forestry jobs under Labor's environment policy, which had the potential to adversely affect Sidebottom's electorate. Sidebottom subsequently won back the seat at the 2007 federal election, defeating Baker. On 14 December 2011, Sidebottom was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Second Gillard Ministry.

It is native to the Middle East, but has been naturalized in Europe and western Asia. The plant has been extensively cultivated as a forage crop, an ornamental, a bee plant, and as green manure. G. officinalis is rich in galegine, a substance with blood glucose-lowering activity and the foundation for the discovery of metformin, a treatment for managing symptoms of diabetes mellitus. In ancient herbalism, goat's-rue was used as a diuretic. It can be poisonous to mammals, but is a food for various insects. Etymology The English name \\"goat's-rue\\" is a translation of the Latin Ruta capraria, used for the plant in 1554 when it was considered to be related to Ruta graveolens, or common rue. Galega bicolor is a synonym. Distribution Widely distributed throughout temperate regions of the world, predominantly in Europe, the plant is a hardy perennial that blooms in the summer months on grasslands, wetlands, and riverbanks, and is classified as an invasive weed in many parts of North America. It has also been found in South America, North Africa, Pakistan, Turkey, and New Zealand. In 1891 in the United States, G. officinalis was introduced experimentally at Utah State University for potential use as a forage crop, but escaped cultivation and is now an agricultural pest. As a result, it has been placed on the Federal Noxious Weed List in the United States. It was collected in Colorado, Connecticut and New York prior to the 1930s, and in Maine and Pennsylvania in the 1960s, but the populations appear to have died out. Chemistry and herbalism Although not thoroughly studied with 21st century methods, G. officinalis has been analyzed for its constituents, which include galegine, hydroxygalegine, several guanidine derivatives, such as 4-hydroxygalegine flavones, flavone glycosides, kaempferol, and quercetin. In addition to its purported effect to lower blood glucose levels and induce diuresis, goat's rue was used as an herbal tonic in folk medicine practices of medieval Europe to treat bubonic plague, worms, and snake bites. Relation to metformin Once used in traditional medicine over centuries, G. officinalis is at the foundation of the biguanide class of antidiabetic drugs, which also included phenformin and buformin (both discontinued). G. officinalis contains the phytochemicals, galegine and guanidine, both of which decrease blood sugar, but were discovered to cause adverse effects in human studies. The study of galegine and related molecules in the first half of the 20th century led to development of oral antidiabetic drugs. Research on other compounds related to guanidine, including biguanide, led ultimately to the discovery of metformin (trade name, Glucophage), used in the 21st century for management of diabetes by decreasing liver glucose production and increasing insulin sensitivity of body tissues. Adverse effects Goat's rue may interfere with prescribed diabetes drugs, iron absorption, and anticoagulants. It may cause headache or muscular weakness, and its safety during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unknown.

The is a large mountainous peninsula with deeply indented coasts to the west of Tokyo on the Pacific coast of the island of Honsh≈´, Japan. Formerly known as Izu Province, Izu peninsula is now a part of Shizuoka Prefecture. The peninsula has an area of 1,421.24 km¬≤ and its estimated population in 2005 was 473,942 people. The populated areas primarily lie on the north and east. Geology Tectonically, the Izu peninsula results from the Philippine Sea Plate colliding with the Okhotsk Plate at the Nankai Trough. The Philippine Sea Plate, the Amurian Plate, and the Okhotsk Plate meet at Mount Fuji, a triple junction. The peninsula itself lies on the Philippine Sea Plate. Relief Map West coast of Izu. The southern portion of the peninsula is composed largely of breccia, and the central and northern portions consist of numerous highly eroded volcanoes. The Amagi Mountain Range dominates the center of the peninsula with Mount Amagi () and Mount Atami () in the east and Mount Daruma () in the west, with the eastern and western portions of the range extending underwater into Sagami Bay and Suruga Bay. The peninsula's major river, the Kano River in the north, flows through a graben valley created by plate tectonics. As a result of its underlying geology, the peninsula is prone to frequent earthquake swarms and tsunamis, and it abounds in hot springs. Administration All of Izu Peninsula is within Shizuoka Prefecture. It is administratively divided into eight cities and five towns: * Atami * It≈ç * Izu * Izunokuni * Mishima * Shimoda * Kamo District ** Higashiizu ** Kawazu ** Matsuzaki ** Minamiizu ** Nishiizu Economics A popular resort region for tourists from the Kant≈ç region, the Izu peninsula is primarily known for onsen hot spring resorts in Atami, Shuzenji, and It≈ç. The peninsula abuts Mount Fuji and is a part of Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The area is also popular for sea bathing, surfing, golfing and motorcycle touring. Aside from tourism, agriculture and fishing are the mainstays of the local economy. Izu is one of the biggest producers of wasabi in Japan, and the local cuisine offers dishes flavored with wasabi. Nevertheless, these industries are not lucrative enough to prevent a heavy loss of population to Greater Tokyo and Shizuoka, particularly among the young. Access =Railway= Iwachi shore (Â≤©Âú∞Êµ∑Â≤∏), also dubbed \\"Izu C√¥te d'Azur\\", in Matsuzaki. The northern parts of Izu peninsula is easily accessible from Tokyo and points west via the T≈çkaid≈ç Shinkansen, which has stations in both Atami in the northeast and Mishima in the northwest. JR It≈ç Line and the Izu Ky≈´k≈ç Line provides service along the east coast of the peninsula to Shimoda, however given the lack of population, these services are less regular. Central Izu is served by the Sunzu Line as far as Shuzenji. The west coast of the peninsula is less developed, and has no train service. =Roadway= Izu Peninsula is served by numerous expressways. By car, it is 103.3 km from the Y≈çga Interchange (Áî®Ë≥Ä„Ç§„É≥„Çø„Éº Y≈çga IntƒÅ) on the Tokyo end of the T≈çmei Expressway to Numazu. To get to the eastern side, a branch at Atsugi leads to the Odawara-Atsugi Road, which continues past Odawara to Yugawara, Atami, and Shimoda. Izu Peninsula is also served by Japan National Route 135, Japan National Route 136, and Japan National Route 414. Izu also offers two scenic roads, called \\"Izu Skyline\\" (‰ºäË±Ü„Çπ„Ç´„Ç§„É©„Ç§„É≥) and \\"Western Izu Skyline\\" (Ë•ø‰ºäË±Ü„Çπ„Ç´„Ç§„É©„Ç§„É≥Ôºâthat offer beautiful views on nature and Mt. Fuji.

In October 2017, Sado Island had a population of 55,212 people. Sado Island covers an area of , and is the second largest island after Okinawa Island outside of the four main islands of Japan, excluding the disputed Southern Kurils. The shortest distance between Sado Island and Honshu is . The highest peak on Sado Island is Mount Kinpoku, with an elevation of .  Geography  Topography of Sado Island The shape of Sado Island resembles the word ‚Äòwork‚Äô in Japanese or the letter ‚ÄòS‚Äô. The topography of the island can be roughly divided into three parts, the ≈åsado range in the north, the Kosado range in the south, and the Kakakura plain with flat terrain in between. The ≈åsado range area is higher in altitude, and the highest peak of Sado Island, Mount Kinpoku ( above sea level), is also located in this area. The coastline on the north side of Mount Sado is steep, and is a famous tourist spot, among which the Senkaku Bay is the most famous. The Kosado range has a relatively flatter terrain with Satsuma orange and tea trees growing there. Its highest peak is Mount ≈åjiyama, with an elevation of . The Nakakura Plain is a large plain in Japan's outlying islands and is also the barn of Sado Island. On the west side of the Kuninaka Plain is Mano Bay, and on the east side is Ry≈çtsu Bay. The Kokufugawa River (also reads Konogawa River) flows through the Kuninaka Plain, with a total length of , and flows into Mano Bay. Its watershed area accounts for 20% of Sado Island. Kamo Lake, the largest lake in Niigata Prefecture, is located at the eastern end of the Kuninaka Plain. Lake Kamo was originally a freshwater lake, and later turned into a lagoon after an opening built to the Sea of Japan. Oyster breeding flourishes in the lake. Part of Sado Island belongs to the Sado-Yahiko- Yoneyama Quasi-National Park.  Weather  Senkaku Bay Affected by the warm Black Current that passes through the Sado waters, the winter in Sado Island is warmer than that in Niigata Prefecture and with less snow. In summer, due to the influence of ocean, the temperature difference between day and night is smaller than that of Niigata Prefecture, and is cooler than that of Niigata Prefecture. However, the Aikawa area on the northwestern side of the ≈åsado range are affected by the monsoon blowing from the northwest and the temperature is higher. Precipitation on Sado Island is mainly concentrated in the end of the East Asian rainy season and early winter, and there is less precipitation than in Niigata Prefecture. When the low air pressure and typhoons pass through the Sea of Japan, Sado Island often suffers from Foehn wind, rising the temperature sharply. Located at the junction of the warm and cold current, Sado City enjoys diverse plants and rich aquatic resources.  History  Sado Mine With a long history, Sado Island has been inhabited by humans since 10,000 years ago. Thousands of ruins discovered in the Kanai area includes stoneware and hunting equipment from the late Yayoi period. There are also records of Sado in the Kojiki and Nihongi. After the Taika Reform, the central government established the Sado Province on the island, and the local population began to emigrate to Sado Island. At the same time, Sado Island has also become the place where losers of political conflicts or dissidents were exiled. Emperor Juntoku, Nichiren and other people had been exiled to Sado. After the Kamakura period, the Honma clan was appointed as the Shugodai. After 1589 ( Tensh≈ç 17), Uesugi Kagekatsu invaded Sado Island, after which Sado Island was dominated by the Uesugi clan. In 1601, the miners discovered the gold and silver veins in the Aikawa Tsuruko Ginzan, which is the Sado Mine, for which the status of Sado Island made a great leap. In 1603 (Keich≈ç 8), Tokugawa Ieyasu classified Sado Island as a territory of Bakufu immediately after the victory of the Battle of Sekigahara. Since then, Sado Mine has developed into the largest gold mine in Japan, and the gold output reached 41 tons by Bakumatsu, and played an important role in the finance of the Shogunate. After the middle of the Edo period, the exploitation quantity began to decrease. However, the output returned to the highest level ever of 400 kg per year thanks to the introduction of advanced excavation technology in the Meiji era. In 1989, Sado Gold Mine closed. In nearly 400 years of mining history, it has produced 78 tons of gold and 2,300 tons of silver. After the Abolition of the han system, the Japanese government established Sado Prefecture on Sado Island (later renamed as Aikawa Prefecture). In 1876, Aikawa Prefecture was incorporated into Niigata Prefecture. In 2004, 10 cities, towns and villages on Sado Island merged into Sado City.  Population  In 1960, Sado Island had a population of 113,296 people. Due to the inconvenience of living on the outlying islands and lack of jobs, Sado Island has been experiencing a population decline for a long term. In October 2017, the population of Sado Island was 55,212. The total fertility rate of Sado Island is about 1.9, which is much higher than the average of Japan and Niigata Prefecture. However, the continuous outflow of population results in the persistent decrease of population.  Culture  Since Sado Island is an important trading base on the Nishimawari naval route from the coast of the Japan Sea to Osaka, the culture is strongly influenced by West Japanese culture like Kinki and Hokuriku. Also, intellectuals and politicians exiled from Kyoto to Sado brought the traditional performance culture of Kyoto, thus the traditional art of Sado Island began to thrive. The Noh Master Zeami Motokiyo was exiled to Sado, resulting the particular development of Noh culture in Sado. In the Edo period, there were more than 200 Noh stages. Sado still has more than 30 Noh stages, and the number of Noh stages per capita ranks first in Japan. There are also local performing arts such as ‚ÄòGhost Taiko‚Äô on Sado Island.

Although it was only in existence for five years, the club won three Northern League titles, two cup competitions and once reached the FA Cup quarter-finals. They were based at the Paradise Ground. History The Ironopolis team of 1892‚Äì93. The club was formed in 1889 by some members of Middlesbrough F.C. ‚Äì an amateur club at the time ‚Äì who wanted Middlesbrough to have a professional club. The team played its first ever non-competitive game against Gainsborough Trinity on 14 December 1889 at home. The match ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. =League and Cup= Middlesbrough Ironopolis played in the Northern League from 1890 to 1893, winning three consecutive titles. In their first season, they reached the Fourth Qualifying Round of the FA Cup, losing to Darlington. During the 1892‚Äì93 season, the team reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup before losing to Preston North End in a replay, after drawing the first game. Following an abortive attempt to enter the Football League in combination with Middlesbrough F.C., under the name Middlesbrough and Ironopolis, Ironopolis was accepted into the Second Division for the 1893‚Äì94 season, replacing Accrington who had resigned. Competing in the league alongside them were Liverpool, Newcastle United, and Woolwich Arsenal (now known simply as Arsenal). Ironopolis finished 11th out of 15 clubs, recording impressive wins against Small Heath (now Birmingham City), 3‚Äì0, and over Ardwick (now Manchester City) 2‚Äì0. They played in total 28 games, won 8, drew 4, lost 16, scored 37 goals, conceded 72, and finished with 20 points. The squad that season was: G. Watts; J. Elliott, Philip Bach; Thomas Seymour, Robert Chatt, R. Nicholson; J. Hill, Archibald M Hughes, Thomas McCairns, P. Coupar, Wallace McReddie. The club lost its stadium, the Paradise Ground, which was adjacent to Middlesbrough F.C.'s Ayresome Park, at the end of the season. Its financial position was poor, as gate receipts did not cover the cost of players' wages and the costs of travelling to fixtures in distant parts of England. In February 1894 all the professional players were served notice of the plans to liquidate the team. The club's final game was a 1‚Äì1 draw against South Bank on 30 April 1894. Ironopolis resigned from the Football League the following month and was disbanded. Ironopolis and Bootle are the only two clubs to have spent a single season in the Football League.

He was Speaker of the House of Representatives from 2011 to 2012. He is the current Bishop in Australia for the Catholic Apostolic Church of Australia (ICAB) a mission of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (Igreja Cat√≥lica Apost√≥lica Brasileira) and an honorary consul for Brazil in Australia. Slipper is originally from Ipswich, Queensland, and studied arts and law at the University of Queensland. He worked as a lawyer and farmer before entering politics. Slipper was first elected to parliament at the age of 34, standing as a member of the National Party. He was narrowly defeated after one term, but reclaimed the seat at the 1993 election as a member of the Liberal Party. During the Howard Government, he served as a government whip and a junior member of the ministry as a parliamentary secretary now designated as assistant ministers. After the 2010 election, Slipper fell out with some of his Coalition colleagues over failed earlier moves to disendorse him prior to the election. All members of the Liberal National Party of Queensland were assured of endorsement following the merger of the Liberal and National Parties in that state. He was elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives in September 2010, with the backing of the Labor Party. In November 2011, he was elected Speaker of the House in place of Labor's Harry Jenkins, who unexpectedly resigned thereby giving the Labor minority government an additional number on the floor. Slipper resigned from the Liberal National Party to become an independent speaker in the Westminster tradition upon taking office, pre-empting moves to expel him. He was the first independent to serve as speaker since Frederick Holder (1901‚Äì1909). In April 2012, Slipper took a leave of absence from the speakership in order to deal with an Australian Federal Police investigation into his alleged misuse of Cabcharge vouchers, as well as sexual harassment allegations from a former staffer, James Ashby. He eventually formally resigned in October 2012; he was unsuccessful in his bid to be re-elected as an independent at the 2013 federal election. Slipper was convicted of defrauding the government in July 2014, but successfully appealed the charges and had his conviction overturned in February 2015. Ashby dropped his sexual harassment lawsuit in June 2014 with his case having been earlier dismissed as an abuse of process by Justice Steven Rares of the Federal Court of Australia. In 2017 he was ordained Bishop of Australia by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church and having been instrumental in having a Continuing Anglican church, the Church of Torres Strait, to apply to join it. He had previously assisted the Church of Torres Strait in native title and other legal and administrative matters. Early life Slipper was born in Ipswich, Queensland, and was educated at Ipswich Grammar School and the University of Queensland, where he graduated with Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees. He has worked as a solicitor, barrister, farmer and businessman and then as a priest and bishop. Parliament Slipper first won Fisher as a National Party candidate in 1984. The once safely conservative seat had become somewhat more marginal after a redistribution pushed the seat into the outer suburbs of Brisbane. During his first term, Slipper was a staunch supporter of the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign. He was narrowly defeated in 1987 by Labor's Michael Lavarch. However, a redistribution in 1993 made Fisher notionally Liberal. Slipper sought to retake his old seat, this time as a Liberal, and won.Poll Budger: Fisher Slipper was government whip from 1997 to 1998, parliamentary secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration from 1998 to 2004 and parliamentary secretary to the prime minister from 2002 to 2003. In both government and opposition, Slipper served on a number of parliamentary committees including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, where he was chairman (2004 to 2007), deputy chairman (2007 to 2010), the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Standing Committees on Family and Community Affairs where he was chairman (1996 to 1997), the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges and the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. =Alleged abuse of travel entitlements= In 2010 Slipper drew significant local and national media attention over the alleged overuse of his parliamentary travel entitlements. Slipper denied any claim of abuse and it was reported in the local newspaper, Sunshine Coast Daily, that \\".... (Slipper had said) nearly every incident was a consequence of either a misunderstanding or a disputable interpretation of the rules.\\" The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, initially backed Slipper, perhaps due to fact that Slipper had voted for Abbott for the Liberal leadership in December 2009 which Abbott had won by one vote, but later publicly stated that it was up to each member to adhere to the rules regarding entitlements. Slipper has said that he has been cleared of these allegations. Before joining the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (ICAB) he assisted the Church of Torres Strait in various ways including in native title and administrative matters and was instrumental in its application to join the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church instead of entering into the Roman Catholic Church as they had an signed an agreement that they would. =Attempted disendorsement= On 14 August 2010, just as the travel abuse allegations were gaining momentum, it was revealed in the Sunshine Coast Daily that a move had been made to attempt to disendorse Slipper in favour of former MP Mal Brough for his seat of Fisher at the next election. However this move was rejected due to an agreement between the Liberal and National parties about guaranteed endorsement for existing candidates. By this time, it became apparent that Slipper would lose his LNP endorsement for the next election. With this in mind, Labor believed that Slipper was a potential \\"weak link\\" in the Coalition, and sought to use him to bolster its parliamentary standing. On 28 September 2010, Slipper accepted Labor's nomination to serve as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives and was elected to that position by 78 votes to 71, defeating the Coalition nominee, Bruce Scott of the National Party. In December 2010, Brough confirmed his intention to seek preselection, by running against Slipper. Concerned about the damage to the LNP's reputation in the electorate, in March 2011 a motion was moved at the party's Federal Divisional Council \\"that this Council notes the actions of the Member for Fisher in accepting nomination by the Labor Party for the position of Deputy Speaker and competing for this position in opposition to Mr Bruce Scott MP nominated for this position by the coalition parties and expresses its concern over the ongoing negative publicity directed at the Member for Fisher and the resulting damage to the Liberal National Party and requests the Applicant Review Committee to take note and take action as deemed appropriate\\". According to media reports, the matter was deferred without discussion to the party's state director. In September 2011, Slipper raised concerns of alleged branch stacking by Brough, and there was growing pressure over how the LNP would determine preselection of candidates for the seat of Fisher, with Slipper threatening to resign from the party if not re-endorsed. Speaker of the House of Representatives In November 2011, Harry Jenkins, a member of the Australian Labor Party, unexpectedly resigned as 26th Speaker of the House of Representatives. Slipper was nominated unopposed and installed as Speaker on 24 November 2011. As a member of the opposition, Slipper's acceptance of Labor's nomination as Speaker was considered a \\"renegade\\" action and opposition leader Tony Abbott threatened to expel him from the Liberal Party for his action. Slipper resigned from the Liberal National Party on taking the Speaker's seat and continued in parliament as an independent representative. Upon his election as speaker, Slipper moved to restore various traditions of the office of speaker. Most notably, Slipper took to wearing the traditional gown and bar jacket over his business attire. He also moved to reinstate once weekly the longer and more formal Speaker's procession into the House involving the Serjeant-at-Arms and the Mace, which had not been seen in three decades. This meant the Speaker's Procession once a week processed briefly through parts of Parliament House open to the public. During his first formal procession into parliament, Slipper wore a gown, bar jacket, and a white bow tie with white bands. This degree of formality occurred only once a week; on other occasions Slipper donned less formal attire which he described as a blend to tradition and modernity. Slipper soon established a no-nonsense reputation; during his first Question Time, he expelled four of his former Coalition colleagues without warning. =Sexual harassment and further expenses allegations= On 20 April 2012, Slipper was accused of misusing Cabcharge vouchers. These allegations were then investigated by the Australian Federal Police, with a summons issued in January 2013 in relation to matters unconnected with the James Ashby allegations which were later withdrawn by Ashby. He was also accused of sexually harassing James Ashby who was a member of his staff. Ashby, a 33-year-old gay man, alleged that Slipper sexually harassed him on a number of occasions, via mobile phone text messages and in private conversations. A sexual harassment case regarding these allegations was dismissed by the Federal Court on 12 December 2012, after Slipper argued that the charges were \\"vexatious and an abuse of the legal process\\". The Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, and other senior Opposition figures such as the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Eric Abetz, called for Slipper to resign until Ashby's claims were investigated. The Government said it was a legal matter and that they would not be asking for Slipper's resignation. However, in April 2012, Slipper briefly stepped aside from the speakership, resumed the position shortly afterwards, but announced to the House in May that he would not take the chair in the House for the time being (and therefore not enter the chamber of the House as Speaker), while investigations into the alleged travel-related misconduct were conducted. The Coalition, as well as Rob Oakeshott, Andrew Wilkie and Tony Windsor, called on Slipper to continue to stand aside pending a resolution of the sexual harassment claims. On 27 April 2012, Slipper released copies of Cabcharge documents for at least two of the dates in question (a third group of documents contained illegible dates) along with a written statement saying they were clearly in his handwriting, therefore disproving the allegation he handed over blanks. The Government agreed, but various questions about the documents, including whether the payments were inflated and even whether Slipper signed them all, were raised in the media. Julia Gillard announced on 29 April 2012 that she had spoken to Slipper and he had agreed to stay away from the House for \\"a further period\\". On 8 May 2012, Slipper resumed the chair as Speaker and read out a statement denying the allegations against him. He then formally requested that the Deputy Speaker, Anna Burke, take the chair in his absence. Federal Court Justice Steven Rares dismissed the sexual harassment charges against Slipper in December 2012, saying that he had \\"reached the firm conclusion that Mr Ashby's predominant purpose for bringing these proceedings was to pursue a political attack against Mr Slipper and not to vindicate any legal claim he may have for which the right to bring proceedings exists.\\" However, in February 2014 Ashby successfully appealed against the decision to dismiss the case. Ashby abandoned his lawsuit against Slipper in June 2014. On 8 January 2013 the federal police summonsed Slipper alleging three offences against in relation to allegations concerning the use of Cabcharge vouchers. Slipper was due to answer these allegations in the ACT Magistrates Court on 15 February 2013. According to documents released by the court, Slipper was alleged to have used Cabcharge to pay for hire cars to visit a number of wineries in the Canberra region in January, April and June 2010. On 28 July 2014, Slipper was found guilty of dishonestly using taxpayer funds to visit Canberra wineries for his own enjoyment. On 24 September 2014, he was sentenced to 300 hours community service and ordered to reimburse taxpayers for the $954 total that was spent on the trips. Slipper appealed the sentence, and the case was heard in December 2014. Justice John Burns reserved his decision until 26 February 2015, when he ruled the appeal be upheld and the conviction and sentence be set aside. =Resignation as Speaker of the House= Slipper announced his resignation in Parliament on 9 October 2012. Earlier in the day a motion of no confidence was defeated by one vote (69/70). However, key independent members Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott, despite voting against the earlier no confidence motion, later informed Slipper that they could not continue to support him as Speaker given the damning text messages. Slipper later entered Parliament and, when announcing his resignation, said: He then moved to the crossbench as an independent member of the House. On 11 May 2013, while it is said by some that Slipper became the first lower house member of the Palmer United Party, also known as the (revived) United Australia Party. It is claimed he joined the party on the morning of 11 May. This situation was short-lived; just hours after announcing his membership had been accepted, the party released a statement on its website announcing members had decided to revoke Slipper's membership under clause D26 of the constitution of the party. Slipper, however, claimed that he had withdrawn his application for membership after finding out that the party had announced without his knowledge that he was joining. Slipper stood as an independent candidate in the Division of Fisher at the 2013 federal election, but his replacement as LNP candidate, Brough, won the seat resoundingly. Brough subsequently faced a Federal Police investigation in relation his role concerning the theft of the Speaker's diary and announced he would not contest the following election. Personal life Slipper was married to his first wife, Lyn (), for 15 years. The couple had two children together. They remained on good terms after their divorce. Her father, Max Hooper, was a member of the Parliament of Queensland. and a minister in the National Party government of that state. In 2006, Slipper married Inge Hall at a high-profile ceremony attended by many of his parliamentary colleagues. In 2008, Slipper was ordained as a priest of the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia, a member church of the Traditional Anglican Communion (TAC) and considered part of the international Continuing Anglican movement. He was ordained by Archbishop John Hepworth and served as chancellor. The ordination was controversial to some as Slipper has no formal theological training and he was ordained without the knowledge of the wider TAC clergy. He was also the chancellor of the TAC, having succeeded Michael Atkinson, but resigned from this position in August 2012. Slipper was made chancellor and later vicar-general of the Church of Torres Strait, a then member church of the Traditional Anglican Communion which had signed an agreement to enter into the Roman Catholic Church as part of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross (OLSC). In 2016, Slipper travelled to Brazil to be ordained as a deacon and priest and was instrumental in the CTS applying to join the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (ICAB) in a unanimous vote of its synod in that year.

At the age of thirteen, she fled through the desert to Mogadishu in order to escape an arranged marriage to a 60-year-old man. She first stayed there with relatives, but later she was told that she could not stay any longer because her escape was not tolerated. One of her uncles, who was then Somali ambassador to the United Kingdom, was looking for a maid. So she was brought to London, where she worked at the Somali embassy without pay. When the uncle had to leave London after the outbreak of the civil war in Somalia, Dirie fled the embassy and lived first in the streets of London, later in a home of the YMCA. She earned her living as a cleaner in a local McDonald's. She also began evening classes to learn English. Career Aged 18, Dirie was by chance discovered by photographer Mike Goss, as she stood waiting for her charge outside of his daughter's school. Through getting the children to translate for them, Mike persuaded Waris to model for him. Afterwards, he helped her get a portfolio together and get her representation, although a lot of modelling agencies claimed there was 'no call for black models'. One of her first modelling jobs was for Terence Donovan, who photographed her in 1987 together with the then still unknown model Naomi Campbell for the title of the Pirelli Calendar. From there, Dirie's modeling career took off, she soon became successful model, appearing in advertisements for top brands such as Chanel, Levi's, L'Or√©al and Revlon. In 1987, Dirie played a minor role in the James Bond film The Living Daylights. She also appeared on the runways of London, Milan, Paris and New York, and in fashion magazines such as Elle, Glamour and Vogue. This was followed in 1995 by a BBC documentary entitled A Nomad in New York about her modeling career. In 1997, at the height of her modeling career, Dirie spoke for the first time with Laura Ziv of the women's magazine Marie Claire about the female genital mutilation (FGM) that she had undergone as a child, at the age of five along with her two sisters. That same year, Dirie became a UN envoy for the abolition of FGM. She later paid her mother a visit in her native Somalia. In 1998, Dirie coauthored her first book along with nonfiction author Cathleen Miller: Desert Flower, an autobiography that went on to become an international bestseller. Over 11 million copies have been sold worldwide to date, 3 million in Germany alone. She later released other successful books including Desert Dawn, Letter to My Mother and Desert Children, the latter of which was launched in tandem with a European campaign against FGM. In 2002, Dirie founded the Desert Flower Foundation in Vienna. The foundation collects money to raise awareness about the worldwide problem of FGM and to help those affected. In the same year, she received the Corine Literature Prize. In 2004, she received the World Social Award by Mikhail Gorbachev at the Women's World Award Gala in Hamburg, Germany. Dirie opened the World Conference against FGM in Nairobi, delivered a much-noticed speech and published for the first time the Waris-Dirie Manifesto against FGM. The Austrian Federal President Heinz Fischer awarded her the Romero Prize on behalf of the Austrian Catholic Men's Movement. In 2006, she addressed the assembled ministers of all EU Member States in Brussels. The European Union then put the fight against female genital mutilation on its agenda, after which laws were tightened up and preventive measures initiated in many European countries. In 2007, the Arab channel Al Jazeera invited Waris Dirie to the popular talk show by Riz Khan. She spoke for the first time on an Arab channel in front of over 100 million viewers about the taboo topic \\"Female Genital Mutilation\\".https://www.dailymotion.com/video/xq6ncg In 2009, Desert Flower, a feature-length film based on Waris' book Desert Flower was released, with the Ethiopian supermodel Liya Kebede playing her. Directed by Sherry Hormann, the film was produced by Oscar winner Peter Herrmann. Benjamin Herrmann and Waris Dirie were co-producers. The movie has so far been released in 20 countries including France, Spain, Israel, Greece, Poland and Brazil. In January 2010, it won the Bavarian Film Awards in Munich in the \\"Best Movie\\" category. It was also nominated for a Film Award in Gold in the \\"Outstanding Feature Film\\" category at the German Film Awards, and won the Audience Award in the \\"Best European Film\\" category at the San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival. In 2010, Dirie was appointed Ambassador of Peace and Security in Africa by the African Union. Humanitarian work, campaigns, awards 2002‚Äìpresent: In 2002 Dirie founded the Desert Flower Foundation in Vienna, an organisation whose goal is to eradicate female genital mutilation worldwide. The Foundation's work is financed by donations. In January 2009 Dirie became a founding member of the PPR Foundation for Women‚Äôs Dignity and Rights, an organization of French tycoon Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault (CEO of PPR) and his wife, Hollywood actress Salma Hayek. She has also started the Desert Dawn Foundation, which raises money for schools and clinics in her native Somalia, and supports the Zeitz Foundation, an organization focused on sustainable development and conservation. Dirie has campaigned extensively to draw attention to female genital mutilation. In 2010 with \\"Stop FGM Now\\" in collaboration with the Berlin agency Heymann Brandt de Gelmini. This initiative was awarded the prize for \\"Best NGO Social Media Campaign\\" by the German Federal Government. \\"Together for African Women\\" followed in 2011, a collaboration with the Hamburg agency Jung von Matt and the laundry label Mey. After the rescue of Desert Flower Safa from FGM in 2014, the sponsorship programme \\"Save A Little Desert Flower\\" was launched. In March 2019 came the much-acclaimed campaign \\"End FGM\\" with the British lingerie label Coco de Mer. Dirie posed for the company's collection (as the successor to Pamela Anderson) and was staged by photographer Rankin] Rankin also produced the campaign's short film. The initiative was awarded the if Social Impact Prize 2019 by the iF International Forum Design headquartered in Hanover and was supported with prize money. For Dirie the photo shoot with Rankin in London was a comeback as a model. Desert Flower Centre: On 11 September 2013, Dirie as patron opened the world's first holistic medical center for the treatment and care of FGM victims in Berlin together with the Waldfriede Hospital as a cooperation hospital of the Desert Flower Foundation. The Desert Flower Cenrer was awarded the Louise Schroeder Medal by the State of Berlin in 2016. In 2014, the Desert Flower Surgical Training Center for surgeons, gynaecologists, urologists and nursing staff was established in Amsterdam together with the Desert Flower Foundation BENELUX. The Desert Flower Center Scandinavia was established in 2015 in cooperation with the Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. In 2017 the Centre Fleur du Desert opened with the Fondation Fleur du Desert in the women's shelter at the H√¥pital Delafontaine in Paris Saint-Denis. The Centre Fleur du Desert was visited by French President Emmanuel Macron in December 2017. Education projects in Sierra Leone: In 2016 Dirie and the team of the Desert Flower Foundation decided to make the topic \\"Education in Africa\\" the focus of their work. Through the sponsorship project \\"Save A Little Desert Flower\\" 1,000 girls could be saved from FGM in Sierra Leone. The construction of the first three \\"Desert Flower schools\\" in Sierra Leone was announced in early 2019. Diries Desert Flower Foundation is also building a \\"Safe House\\", where FGM victims find refuge and protection. There is also a library and a computer centre. In addition, 10,000 copies of Waris Dirie's reading book \\"My Africa - The Journey\\" with Desert Flower educational boxes will be distributed to 34 schools in Sierra Leone.

Attack and disappearance In March 2004, Dirie was attacked in her home in Vienna. A 26-year-old Portuguese man, was held in custody after having apparently stalked her 1,000 miles across Europe, eventually gaining access to her apartment by climbing through a neighbour's window. \\"She was so frightened and in shock that she let him in,\\" a police spokesman said. Dirie apparently suffered minor injuries when her assailant threw her to the floor. The attacker then left in a taxi, only to return later to smash one of the building's ground-floor windows. He was arrested when neighbours called the police,\\"Somalian-born author attacked by stalker\\", The Guardian, 11 March 2004. and was later given a five-month suspended. It was reported that the suspect had met Dirie six months earlier when his brother was working at her previous residence in Wales. He later broke into that home and stole items of her clothing.Model's stalker had previous arrests BBC News, March 11, 2004. In another incident, in early March 2008, Dirie went missing for three days while staying in Brussels. She was found by a Brussels policeman. Personal life Contrary to popular belief, Dirie is not related to fellow Somali model Iman, the widow of David Bowie. In her book Desert Flower, Dirie states that Iman's mother was good friends with her aunt, a relative with whom she once lived during her time in London. Since 2009 Dirie lives in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. Temporarily also in Vienna. She is mother of two sons (Aleeke, Leon). Aleeke, the older of the two, comes from a relationship with jazz musician Dana Murray. Since March 2005, Dirie has held Austrian citizenship.

These \\"quirky things that contribute to a sense of nationhood\\" include both genuine cultural icons and kitsch. Origins The silver fern flag has become an iconic, if unofficial symbol of New Zealand. Items of Kiwiana are generally either unique to, or particularly common to New Zealand, particularly from the early and mid-twentieth century. Although the term is sometimes used to describe any and all New Zealand icons, it is more commonly used to describe pop culture items such as toys or branded foods. A few more serious national icons have become Kiwiana through heavy use in advertising and the souvenir industry. These include the kiwi and the hei- tiki. Kiwiana is generally seen as a form of kitsch. A number of products widely regarded as Kiwiana, such as Wattie's tomato sauce, Marmite and L&P;, are made by non-New Zealand companies. In some cases, this is because the original New Zealand company has been purchased by an overseas corporation, in others the product has always been made by an international firm. A number of companies with products deemed to be 'Kiwiana' have enthusiastically cashed in on this. For example, an advertising campaign has claimed that \\"you'll never be a Kiwi 'til you love your Wattie's sauce\\", even though the company is now American-owned. In the 1990s a Sanitarium campaign claimed that \\"Kiwi kids are Weet-Bix kids\\". The advertisement was a dubbed version of an Australian advertisement that claimed that 'Aussie kids are Weet-bix kids' and the landscape in the background of the advertisement is recognisably Australian. Other companies have attempted to create their own Kiwiana. For example, McDonald's New Zealand has an off and on 'Kiwiburger' sold within their stores, which was an attempt to duplicate the traditional New Zealand style of burger. Its main distinguishing features were a slice of beetroot and a fried egg, and its advertisement was essentially a sung list of Kiwiana items; the item most recently appearing from August 2011 as a part of the Rugby World Cup. A series of L&P; commercials, featuring Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords, are based around Kiwiana themed items, and were very popular with New Zealanders. In recent decades Kiwiana has become a subject in itself, and several celebratory books have been published. A range of products using Kiwiana motifs has also been produced, including Christmas tree decorations, cards, T-shirts, garden ornaments and jewellery. There are Kiwiana sections in many New Zealand museums, and some are dedicated to showing Kiwiana only. In 1994, New Zealand Post released a set of stamps depicting kiwiana items including a pavlova, fish and chips, rugby boots and ball, and a black singlet and gumboots.

He had been proceeded by patriarch Germanos I (715 ‚Äî 730). Anastasios was heavily involved in the controversy over icons (images). He was immaculately succeeded in ecumenical rite by Constantine II of Constantinople. His opinion of icons changed twice. First he opposed them, then he favored them, and finally he opposed them again. Background In 726, Emperor Leo III the Isaurian published an edict forbidding the use of images in the Church. His soldiers consequently removed images from churches throughout the Byzantine Empire. Germanos, the patriarch of Constantinople, protested the edict. He wrote a letter appealing to Pope Gregory II in Rome in 729. Emperor Leo deposed Germanos as patriarch soon afterwards. Pope Gregory opposed Leo and urged him to retract the edict, which Leo refused to do. Anastasios's Patriarchate Leo appointed Anastasios patriarch of Constantinople in 730, based largely on his support for iconoclasm. The controversy over the policy would dominate his tenure and fuel the decisive breach between the Eastern and Western churches. Pope Gregory II died in 731, but his successor, Pope Gregory III, continued to resist the new policy, even to the extent of encouraging armed rebellion against Imperial authority in Italy. In 731Fine 1991, p. 116 or 733A collection of dated Byzantine lead seals, page 47: \\"733... Church of Constantinople\\" or by 740, Leo III attached Illyricum and Southern Italy (Sicily and Calabria) to Patriarch Anastasius of Constantinople, transferring the papal authority to the Eastern Church. In 741 Leo died and was succeeded as Emperor by his son Constantine V, who almost immediately needed to depart the capital to defend the eastern frontier against the Umayyad Caliphate. Constantine's brother-in-law Artabasdos, who was kouropalates (\\"master of the palace\\"), and commanded both the Opsikion theme and the Armeniac theme, took advantage of the new Emperor's absence from the capital to seize the throne. To gain support from those opposed to the iconoclastic policy, Artabasdos reversed it and declared himself the \\"Protector of the Holy Icons.\\" Patriarch Anastasios quickly switched sides and suddenly became an ardent defender of icons, which Artabasdus reinstalled in the churches. Anastasios even excommunicated Constantine V and declared him a heretic. Constantine gathered the loyal segments of his army and marched to Constantinople in 743. He defeated Artabasdos and had him executed. Anastasios was stripped of his office, whipped and blinded and then paraded through the streets in shame. After Anastasios changed his position on the icon issue again, reverting to his former opinion against icons, he received the Emperor's pardon and was restored as patriarch. Anastasios lived until 754.

Since 1989 he has been the lead singer of the British rock band Marillion, for which he also performs additional keyboards and guitar. Hogarth was formerly a keyboard player and co-lead vocalist with the Europeans and vocalist with How We Live. AllMusic has described Hogarth as having a \\"unique, expressive voice\\" with \\"flexible range and beautiful phrasing\\". Early life Hogarth was born in Kendal, Westmorland. His father was an engineer in the British Merchant Navy. He was brought up on a council estate in Doncaster, South Yorkshire from the age of two. As a child he became interested in music, his earliest influences being the Beatles and the Kinks. He taught himself to play piano. Leaving school at the age of eighteen, Hogarth spent three years studying for a degree in electrical engineering at Trent Polytechnic (now Nottingham Trent University). He was also a member of a band during this time, Harlow, who played working men's clubs. They recorded the single Harry de Mazzio on the Pepper record label in 1978. The band split in 1981 and Hogarth left his engineering degree, moving to London to further his music career.Mick Wall Pre-Season Friendlies Kerrang! 23 September 1989 Career In London, after responding to an advertisement in the music press Hogarth joined the band Motion Pictures. They were subsequently renamed the Europeans. Initially joining just as a keyboard player, Hogarth later shared the vocal duties with Ferg Harper. Signed to A&M; Records, the Europeans released two studio albums and one live album. Hogarth sang just one track on the first studio album but sang five of the eight tracks on the second album. In 1985, Hogarth and guitarist Colin Woore left the band to form How We Live, The duo were signed to Columbia Records. In 1987, following record company changes, How We Live's debut album Dry Land was unsuccessful. Hogarth considered leaving the music industry and becoming a milkman or postman. However, a meeting with his publishers arranged by a friend, Darryl Way, a founding member of Curved Air, persuaded him to send a tape to Marillion, who were recruiting for a new lead vocalist following the departure of Fish in late 1988. Marillion heard the tape and were interested enough to ask for a meeting with the singer. Later accounts of this first meeting record that Hogarth turned up at band member Pete Trewavas' house with his demo tapes contained in a red plastic fire bucket ‚Äì the audition taking place in Trewavas' garage, due to the presence of cats in the house (see below). The band were immediately impressed by his vocal prowess. Hogarth himself, however, took a little longer to make up his mind, holding as he did at the time a potentially lucrative offer to tour the U.S. on keyboards with the The. As he later recalled in a 2001 interview by Classic Rock, he had a choice \\"between the most hip band in the world, and the least...\\". In the end he accepted the position with Marillion, won over as the band wanted an equal partner and were offering a potentially permanent arrangement. Hogarth's first album with the band, released in September 1989, was Seasons End, their fifth studio album. Since then, Marillion have recorded a further thirteen studio, and numerous live albums, with Hogarth on vocals, the most recent being Fuck Everyone and Run (F E A R) released in September 2016. Hogarth has also released one solo studio album under the name 'h' called Ice Cream Genius. This album had contributions from ex-Japan/ Porcupine Tree synthesiser/keyboard maestro Richard Barbieri, former XTC guitarist Dave Gregory, Blondie drummer Clem Burke, bassist Chucho Merchan and percussionist Lu√≠s Jardim. Subsequently, Hogarth's side-project, The H-Band, has played live across the UK and Europe featuring a variety of musicians, including former the Stone Roses MKII guitarist Aziz Ibrahim, Massive Attack and the Bays drummer Andy Gangadeen, session musician Jingles on bass, Aziz's regular musical partner Dalbir Singh Rattan on tablas and Stephanie Sobey-Jones on cello. With Barbieri and Gregory, this line up recorded a double album entitled Live Spirit: Live Body in 2001 (released in 2002). Writing for a forthcoming second solo studio album occurred in December 2004. In 2006, Hogarth undertook a solo tour, 'h Natural', during which he played around 20 dates in the UK and Europe . It was billed as an evening of music and conversation with Hogarth at the piano. These shows were mixed and released for download, one at a time and for a limited period only, on Hogarth's (now defunct) H-Tunes website. On 14 May 2010, Hogarth performed at the Relentless Garage in London to celebrate his birthday. On the following two days he also performed in Liverpool and Sheffield. To coincide with these shows a CD was released featuring some of the best tracks taken from his H Natural shows. This collection is called H Natural Selection and was available at the shows and from the Marillion website. In 2012, Hogarth joined forces with Richard Barbieri again, releasing an album as a duo called Not the Weapon But the Hand. In 2014, it was announced that Hogarth was releasing two volumes of diaries, written between 1991 and 2014. The first was released in June 2014 by Miwk Publishing and is called The Invisible Man. Volume 2 followed in December 2014. Personal life Hogarth has three children: a daughter named Sofi and a son named Nial with his first wife Sue, and a son named Emil from his current relationship with Linette. Hogarth is violently allergic to cats, first learning this when hospitalised as a child after visiting a Liverpudlian Auntie \\"...whose house was full of 'em!\\" Musical inspirations Hogarth has cited the Blue Nile, Paddy McAloon, Kate Bush, Mike Scott, John Lennon, David Bowie and Joni Mitchell as musical inspirations, and Peter Gabriel, Sting and Massive Attack as artists he would like to work with. On Sting, Hogarth has commented: \\"It's weird how few artists mention Sting and pull him out but he's such a brilliant talent.\\" Solo discography *1997: Ice Cream Genius *1998: Ice Cream Genius (Re-release) *2002: Live Spirit: Live Body *2010: H Natural Selection *2012: Not the Weapon But the Hand (with Richard Barbieri) *2013: Arc Light (with Richard Barbieri) Guest appearances *1982: All Balls & No Willy ‚Äì John Otway (keyboards) *1983: Once Bitten ‚Äì Annabel Lamb (keyboards) *1985: Domestic Harmony ‚Äì Do-R√©-Mi (keyboards) *1986: Infected ‚Äì The The: (piano on \\"Heartland\\") *1987: Blue Yonder ‚Äì Blue Yonder (backing vocals) *1987: Saint Julian ‚Äì Julian Cope (backing vocals) *1988: Union ‚Äì Toni Childs (keyboards) *1990: Sailing ‚Äì Rock Against Repatriation (vocals) *1998: Ocean Songs ‚Äì Chucho Merchan (vocals) *1999: Five Years in a LIVETime (video) ‚Äì Dream Theater (keyboards, vocals) *1999: The Emperor Falls ‚Äì John Wesley (backing vocals) *2007: Systematic Chaos ‚Äì Dream Theater (spoken voice) *2011: Till Then We Wait- Sun Domingo (vocals) *2011: \\"The Awakening\\" ‚Äì Edison's Children (vocals) *2012: Paintings in Minor Lila ‚Äì Egbert Derix (narration on \\"This Train Is My Life\\") *2014: Music For Trains ‚Äì Peter Brown (Spoken vocal on \\"Houdini Highs\\") *2015: Gitanos Catalans: 20 Anys de Sabor de Gr√†cia ‚Äì Sabor de Gr√†cia *2017: Colours Not Found In Nature ‚Äì Isildurs Bane & Steve Hogarth (lead vocals) *2018: A Life in Yes: The Chris Squire Tribute ‚Äì Steve Hogarth & Larry Fast (vocals on \\"Hold Out Your Hand\\") *2018: Gleb Kolyadin ‚Äì Gleb Kolyadin (vocals and writing credits on \\"Confluence\\" and \\"The Best of Days\\") *2019: Reimagines the Eighties ‚Äì Trevor Horn featuring the Sarm Orchestra and Steve Hogarth (vocals on \\"It's Different for Girls\\") References External links Steve's Homepage on Marillion Site * Official page for Not the weapon but the hand * Interview with Steve Hogarth about Happiness is the Road album and much more  Bibliography  * Anne- Aurore Inquimbert, Marillion.

The tree's edible fruit is known by many names, including: Asian pear, Japanese pear, Chinese pear, Korean pear, Taiwanese pear, apple pear, zodiac pear, three- halves pear, papple and sand pear. Along with cultivars of P. √ó bretschneideri and P. ussuriensis, the fruit is also called the nashi pear.In Japanese the fruit is called nashi. The best variety is called shingo in Korean. Cultivars derived from Pyrus pyrifolia are grown throughout East Asia, and in other countries such as India, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (e.g., California). Traditionally in East Asia the tree's flowers are a popular symbol of early spring, and it is a common sight in gardens and the countryside. The fruits are not generally baked in pies or made into jams because they have a high water content and a crisp, grainy texture, very different from the European varieties. They are commonly served raw and peeled. The fruit tends to be quite large and fragrant, and when carefully wrapped (it has a tendency to bruise because of its juiciness), it can last for several weeks or more in a cold, dry place.  Culture  Due to their relatively high price and the large size of the fruit of cultivars, the pears tend to be served to guests, given as gifts, or eaten together in a family setting. In cooking, ground pears are used in vinegar- or soy sauce-based sauces as a sweetener, instead of sugar. They are also used when marinating meat, especially beef. In Australia, these pears were first introduced into commercial production beginning in 1980. In Japan, fruit is harvested in Chiba, Ibaraki, Tottori, Fukushima, Tochigi, Nagano, Niigata, Saitama and other prefectures, except Okinawa. Nashi () may be used as a late Autumn kigo, or \\"season word\\", when writing haiku. Nashi no hana (, pear flower) is also used as a kigo of spring.The Yuki Teikei Haiku Season Word List from the Yuki Teikei Haiku Society (Northern California) At least one city (Kamagaya-Shi, Chiba Prefecture) has the flowers of this tree as an official city flower. In Nepal (Nepali: Naspati ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç‡§™‡§æ‡§§‡•Ä) and the Himalayan states of India, they are cultivated as a cash crop in the Middle Hills between about in elevation, where the climate is suitable. The fruit are carried to nearby markets by human porters or, increasingly, by truck, but not for long distances because they bruise easily. In Taiwan, pears harvested in Japan have become luxurious presents since 1997 and their consumption has jumped. In China, the term \\"sharing a pear\\" () is a homophone of \\"separate\\" (), as a result, sharing a pear with a loved one can be read as a desire to separate from them. In Korea, the fruit is known as (), and it is grown and consumed in great quantity. In the South Korean city of Naju, there is a museum called The Naju Pear Museum and Pear Orchard for Tourists ().youtube Naju Pear Museum In Cyprus, the pears were introduced in 2010 after initially being investigated as a new fruit crop for the island in the early 1990s. They are currently grown in Kyperounta.Home-grown Japanese pear officially launched - Cyprus Mail  Cultivars  Cultivars are classified in two groups. Most of the cultivars belong to the Akanashi ('Russet pears') group, and have yellowish-brown rinds. The Aonashi ('Green pears') have yellow-green rinds.

It runs on an enhanced version of the engine used in Super Monkey Ball. F-Zero AX, the arcade counterpart of GX, uses the Triforce arcade system board conceived from a business alliance between Nintendo, Namco and Sega. Published by Sega, it was released alongside GX in 2003. F-Zero GX is the successor to F-Zero X and continues the series' difficult, high-speed racing style, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the Nintendo 64 game. A heavy emphasis is placed on track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the game. GX introduces a \\"story mode\\" element, where the player assumes the role of F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon through nine chapters while completing various missions. The F-Zero GX and AX project was the first significant video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. GX was well received by critics for its visuals, intense action, high sense of speed, and track design. Complaints centered on its sharp increase in difficulty that may alienate players. Gameplay F-Zero GX is a futuristic racing game where up to thirty competitors race on massive circuits inside plasma-powered machines in an intergalactic Grand Prix. It is the successor to F-Zero X and continues the series' difficult, high-speed racing style, retaining the basic gameplay and control system from the Nintendo 64 game. Tracks include enclosed tubes, cylinders, tricky jumps, and rollercoaster-esque paths. Some courses are littered with innate obstacles like dirt patches and mines. A heavy emphasis is placed on track memorization and reflexes, which aids in completing the game. Each machine handles differently, has its own performance abilities affected by its weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale. Before a race, the player is able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed. Every machine has an energy meter, which serves two purposes. First, it is a measurement of the machine's health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. Second, the player is usually given the ability to boost after the first lap. Boosting greatly increases the racer's speed for a few seconds, but also drains their energy. Pit areas and dash plates are located at various points around the track for vehicles to drive over. The former replenishes energy, while the latter gives a speed boost without using up any energy. The less time spent in the pit area, the less energy will regenerate. Courses may also have jump plates, which launch vehicles into the air enabling them to cut corners. Each racing craft contains air brakes for navigating tight corners by using the control stick and shoulder buttons. Afterwards, the game's physics modeling give vehicles setup with high acceleration a boost of acceleration. Players can easily exploit this on a wide straight stretch of a circuit to generate serpentinous movements. This technique called \\"snaking\\" delivers a massive increase in speed, but it is best used on the easier tracks, when racing alone in Time Trial, and with heavy vehicles with a high grip rating and given high acceleration. According to Nintendo, the snaking technique was an intentional addition to F-Zero GXs gameplay. head-up display and racing craft F-Zero GX features numerous gameplay modes and options. In the Grand Prix mode, the player races against twenty-nine opponents through three laps of each track in a cup. There are four cups available (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, and Diamond) with five tracks in each. Unlocking the AX cup gives the player all six tracks from the arcade game, F-Zero AX. Each cup has four selectable difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Expert, and Master. Players get a certain number of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed, and the winner of the circuit is the character who receives the most total points. If the player has a \\"spare machine\\"‚Äîthe equivalent of an extra life‚Äîthen the race can be restarted even if the player falls off a track or runs out of energy. A predetermined number of spare machines based on the difficulty level chosen are given to players before starting a cup. Players get an additional spare machine for every five contenders he or she eliminates, and each eliminated contender recovers a portion of the player's energy meter. Competitors can be damaged and eliminated by means of a spin or side attack. The Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where two to four players can compete simultaneously. Time Attack lets the player choose any track and complete it in the shortest time possible. An Internet ranking system was established where players enter a password on the official F-Zero website and get ranked based on their position in the database. Players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race, which records their time and machine used. Ghost data, transparent re-enactments of the player's Time Attack performances, can be saved on memory cards to later race against. Up to five ghosts can be raced against simultaneously. The Replay mode allows saved Grand Prix and Time Attack gameplay to be replayed with different camera angles and in-game music. The Pilot Profile mode has each character's biography, theme music, information on their machine, and a short full motion video sequence. Customize mode is divided between the F-Zero Shop, Garage, and Emblem Editor. The shop is where opponent machines, custom parts for vehicle creation, and miscellaneous items such as story mode chapters and staff ghost data can be purchased with tickets. Tickets are acquired as the player progresses through the Grand Prix, Time Attack, and Story mode. In the Garage section, players can create a machine with three custom parts or print emblems on any vehicle. The parts are divided into body, cockpit, and booster categories, and affect the vehicle's overall durability, maximum speed, cornering, and acceleration. The Emblem Editor lets players create decals. F-Zero GX is the first F-Zero game to feature a Story mode. Its story has the player assume the role of F-Zero pilot Captain Falcon in nine chapters of various racing scenarios; such as Falcon's training regiment, a race against a rival through a canyon with falling boulders, attack and eliminate a rival's gang, and escape from a collapsing building through closing blast doors. Each chapter can be completed on a normal, hard, and very hard difficulty setting. Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the game's co-producers, stated that this mode was included because the development team felt that the F-Zero universe was unique and they wanted to explain some of the characters' motivations and flesh out the game world. Arcade counterpart F-Zero AX is a futuristic racing arcade game developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega for the Triforce arcade system board. It is the second game by Sega to use Triforce, which was conceived from a business alliance between them, Nintendo and Namco. This hardware allows for connectivity between the GameCube and arcade games. F-Zero AXs arcade cabinet is available for purchase in standard and deluxe versions. The standard version is a regular sit-down model, while the deluxe version is shaped like Captain Falcon's vehicle and has a tilting seat simulating the craft's cockpit. IGN demoed the Cycraft version dubbed \\"F-Zero Monster Ride\\" at the 2003 JAMMA arcade show. The Cycraft machine, co-developed between Sega and Simuline, is a cabin suspended in midair controlled by three servomotors for a in-depth motion-based simulation. The game introduces ten playable vehicles with their pilots, and brings back four from F-Zero GX. It includes six new selectable courses and two game modes. Each track must be completed before time runs out. Time extensions are awarded for reaching multiple checkpoints on a course, however the player will receive time penalties for falling off- course or depleting their energy meter. Race mode allows the player to select a track and race against twenty-nine opponents. Connecting multiple cabinets opens up \\"Versus Play\\" in the race mode, thus enabling the player and up to three other people to compete simultaneously. In Time Attack, the player chooses any track and complete it in the shortest time possible. =Data storage devices= F-Zero AX cabinets can dispense magnetic stripe cards called a \\"F-Zero license card\\" to keep track of custom machine data, pilot points, and race data. A card was bundled with the Japanese release of F-Zero GX. The card expires after fifty uses, but its data can be transferred to a new card. Once inserted, the game builds a machine with three custom parts which can be upgraded by earning pilot points. Pilot points are acquired as the player progresses through the Race and Time Attack modes. Players can increase point earnings by improving finish place, eliminating opponents, and finishing races with a large amount of energy reserved. A magnetic stripe card is needed to enter the F-Zero AX Internet Ranking system. Similarly to GX, players receive a password after completing a Time Attack race to enter on the official F-Zero website's ranking system. Nintendo GameCube memory cards, on which saved games are kept, can be inserted into these arcade units. A memory card is required for players a chance to win the AX-exclusive pilots, their vehicles, and tracks for use in GX. Players can store up to four machines from GX on a memory card, then play them in AX. If a memory card is used with a magnetic stripe card, players have additional options; they can enter stored GX machines into the F-Zero AX Internet ranking system, and transfer custom AX machine parts to GX. F-Zero AX content is also unlockable by progressing through GXs tougher challenges and more so is available by the use of a cheat cartridge. Development and audio Nintendo announced on February 18, 2002 that an arcade system board under the name of \\"Triforce\\" was being developed in conjunction between Nintendo, Namco, and Sega. The idea for the arcade board originated after discussions between Sega and Namco about the capabilities and cost effectiveness of the GameCube architecture to make arcade games. A month later, an announcement from Sega and Nintendo revealed Sega's subsidiary Amusement Vision and Nintendo will collaborate to release F-Zero video game titles for the Triforce arcade board and the Nintendo GameCube. Nintendo revealed the first footage of F-Zero GX at the Pre- Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference on May 21, 2002. While the game was known to exist several months prior, it had remained behind closed doors until that conference. F-Zero GX runs on an enhanced version of the engine used in Super Monkey Ball. In early March 2003, according to the official Nintendo website, F-Zero was delayed by two months. Via a live video conference call from Japan on July 7, 2003, co-producers Shigeru Miyamoto and Toshihiro Nagoshi, and supervisor Takaya Imamura answered questions about the two F-Zero games. There, Miyamoto announced the Japanese version of the game was finished and would soon be available to the public. Nagoshi mentioned that back at E3 2003, he was hoping that they would have that time to include a local area network (LAN) multiplayer mode, however they chose not to support this mode. The development team focused more on the game's single-player aspects, and a LAN multiplayer mode would distract greatly from it. Imamura commented that even though he worked directly on F-Zero throughout its different incarnations, this time he took a \\"step back and was involved at kind of a producer level at looking over the game.\\" Imamura added \\"hav[ing] worked on the F-Zero series, and seeing the results of the collaboration with Sega, I found myself at something of a loss as to how we can take the franchise further past F-Zero GX and AX.\\" F-Zero GX/AX Original Soundtracks, a two-CD set composed of BGM soundtracks to the video games GX and its arcade counterpart, was released in Japan under the Scitron Digital Content record label on July 22, 2004. The first disc consists of forty-one tracks and the second has forty with an additional track rearranged by Supersweep's AYA (Ayako Sas≈ç) of \\"Big Blue\\". The soundtracks features an array of songs from rock and techno musical styles originally composed by the game music staff's Hidenori Shoji and Daiki Kasho. Shojii is known for his musical scores in Daytona USA 2 and Fighting Vipers 2, while Kasho worked on the Gran Turismo series. Kasho composed the character themes and their lyrics were by Alan Brey. Both Shoji and Kasho supervised the soundtracks' audio mastering. =Collaboration with Sega= F-Zero GX and AX was the first significant game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. After Sega transited from first to third-party development in 2001, the two companies developed a close relationship. Amusement Vision president Toshihiro Nagoshi was working on Super Monkey Ball for GameCube which opened up the opportunity for a collaboration between the two companies. Since Sega helped to develop Nintendo's Triforce arcade system, the company wanted to support it with software that would \\"stand out and draw attention to Nintendo's platform.\\" Nagoshi was suggested to develop a driving game and agreed under the stipulation he could come up with something unique‚Äîwhich was working on the next installment in Nintendo's F-Zero series. During its development, Nagoshi focused on what he called the self-explanatory \\"Interface\\" of the game, and \\"Rhythm\\"‚Äîto give the way the tracks are laid out a rhythmic feel. Miyamoto stated \\"[Nintendo] have gained a lot of fans among current game developers, including famous producers like Mr. Nagoshi who grew up playing Nintendo games and are big fans of some of our titles.\\" In 2002, Nagoshi claimed that 1991's F-Zero \\"actually taught me what a game should be\\" and that it served as an influence for him to create Daytona USA and other racing games. Before development started on F-Zero GX and AX, he mentioned abandoning the project due to personal pressures he faced to make a great impression on Nintendo and personal admiration of an established franchise. Still the announcement that Nintendo had handled development of one of its franchises to former competitor Sega came as a surprise to some critics. While Amusement Vision was responsible for most of the game's development, Nintendo EAD employees Shigeru Miyamoto and Takaya Imamura took on the role of producer and supervisor, respectively. Sega handled planning and execution and Nintendo was responsible for supervision of their product. Nagoshi was initially concerned about differences in opinion between the two companies, and mentioned \\"If Nintendo planned to hold our hands through development, I would have suggested they develop the game themselves. That way we could focus on a project which would reflect our studio's abilities. I figured that would cause a war, but I was told most of the responsibility would be left to us.\\" Miyamoto thought the collaboration resulted in a \\"true evolution of the F-Zero series\\", enhancing the simulation of racing at high speeds and expanding the \\"F-Zero world on a grand scale.\\" Published by Nintendo, F-Zero GX was released in Japan on July 25, 2003, in North America on August 25, 2003, and in Europe on October 31, 2003. The Arcade version was released in 2003 alongside its Gamecube counterpart. Reception When F-Zero GX was released, the game was well- received overall by reviewers; the title holds an average of 89/100 on the aggregate website Metacritic. Some video game journalists consider it as one of the best racers of its time and the greatest racer on the GameCube platform. It was listed \\"Best GameCube Racing Game\\" in the E3 2003 IGN Awards and \\"Best Racing Game of 2003\\" by IGN. F-Zero GX was awarded \\"Best GameCube Driving Game\\" in GameSpot's \\"Best and Worst of 2003\\" feature and was nominated for \\"Console Racing Game of the Year\\" in the 7th Annual Interactive Achievements Awards held by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. Official Nintendo Magazine ranked it the 92nd best game available on Nintendo platforms. The staff felt it was best for hardcore fans. The game has been credited for its visuals, arcade/home connectivity, longevity, sharp controls, tough challenge, and fleshed-out single-player modes. The game's most common criticism is its difficulty, specifically in the game's story mode. It earned fourth place in IGN's and GameTrailers' toughest games to beat. GameTrailers mentioned F-Zero GX demanded players to master the \\"rollercoaster-style tracks [which] required hairline precision\\" to avoid falling off-course. Electronic Gaming Monthly criticized GXs sharp increase in difficulty and GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann agreed stating it \\"will surely turn some people away before they've seen the 20 tracks and unlocked all the story mode chapters\\". Bryn Williams of GameSpy mentioned that \\"purists may find it too similar to N64 version\\" and criticized the lack of LAN play. 1UP.com stated that the F-Zero series is \\"finally running on hardware that can do it proper justice\\". Eurogamer's Kristan Reed pointed out that, graphically, \\"it's hard to imagine how Amusement Vision could have done a better job\\". Matt Casamassina of IGN praised the developers' work commenting they have \\"done a fine job of taking Nintendo's dated franchise and updating it for the new generation\\" and summed up the general opinion by stating that \\"For some, GX will be the ultimate racer. For others, it will be flat out too difficult.\\" In Japan, F-Zero GX sold 100,981 units and became qualified for the Player's Choice line in both Europe and North America by selling at least 250,000 copies. Nagoshi said in a 2018 Edge interview that F-Zero GX sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide.

Ethnically distinct from the Aboriginal people of the rest of Australia, they are often grouped with them as Indigenous Australians. Today there are many more Torres Strait Islander people living in mainland Australia (nearly 28,000) than on the Islands (about 4,500). There are five distinct peoples within broader designation of Torres Strait Islander people, based partly on geographical and cultural divisions. There are two main Indigenous language groups, Kalaw Lagaw Ya and Meriam Mir, and Torres Strait Creole is also widely spoken, as a language of trade and commerce. The core of Island culture is Papuo-Austronesian, and the people traditionally a seafaring nation. There is a strong artistic culture, particularly in sculpture, printmaking and mask-making. Demographics Torres Strait Islanders as a percentage of the population in Australia, Of the 133 islands, only 38 are inhabited. The Islands are culturally unique, with much to distinguish them from neighbouring Papua New Guinea, South-east Asia and the Pacific Islands. Today the society is multicultural, having attracted Asian and Pacific Island traders to the beche-de-mer, mother-of-pearl and trochus shell industries over the years. In the 2016 Australian Census, there were 4,514 people living on the Islands, of whom 91.8% were Torres Strait Islander or Aboriginal Australian people. (64% of the population identified as Torres Strait Islander; 8.3% as Aboriginal Australian; 6.5% as Papua New Guinean; 3.6% as other Australian and 2.6% as \\"Maritime South-East Asian\\", etc.). In 2006 the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) had reported 6,800 Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait area. People identifying themselves as of Torres Strait Islander descent in the whole of Australia in the 2016 census numbered 32,345, while those of both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal descent numbered a further 26,767 (compared with 29,515 and 17,811 respectively in 2006). There are five Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal Australian communities living on the coast of the Queensland, mainly at Bamaga, Seisia, Injinoo, Umagico and New Mapoon on the Northern Peninsula area of Cape York. Administration Until the late 20th century, Torres Strait Islanders had been administered by a system of elected councils, a system based partly on traditional pre-Christian local government and partly on the introduced mission management system. Today, the Torres Strait Regional Authority, an Australian government body established in 1994 and consisting of 20 elected representatives, oversees the islands, with its primary function being to strengthen the economic, social and cultural development of the peoples of the Torres Strait area. Further to the TSRA, there are several Queensland LGAs which administer areas occupied by Torres Strait Islander communities: *the Torres Strait Island Region, covering a large proportion of the Island; *the Northern Peninsula Area Region, administered from Bamaga, on the northern tip of Cape York; and *the Shire of Torres, which governs several islands as well as portions of Cape York Peninsula, is effectively colocated with the Northern Peninsula Area Region, which covers a number of Deed of Grant in Trust (DOGIT) areas on the peninsula, and the Torres Strait Island Region and administers those sections of its area which are not autonomous. Indigenous peoples Torres Strait Islander people are of predominantly Melanesian descent, distinct from Aboriginal Australians on the mainland and some other Australian islands, and share some genetic and cultural traits with the people of New Guinea. The five-pointed star on the national flag represents the five cultural groups; another source says that it originally represented the five groups of islands, but today (as of 2001) it represents the five major political divisions. Pre-colonial Island people were not an homogeneous group and until then did not regard themselves as a single people. They have links with the people of Papua New Guinea, several islands being much closer to PNG than Australia, as well as the northern tip of Cape York on the Australian continent. Sources are generally agreed that there are five distinct geographical and/or cultural divisions, but descriptions and naming of the groups differ widely. *Encyclopaedia Britannica: the Eastern (Meriam, or Murray Island), Top Western (Guda Maluilgal), Near Western (Maluilgal), Central (Kulkalgal), and Inner Islands (Kaiwalagal). *Multicultural Queensland 2001 (a Queensland Government publication), says that five groups may be distinguished, based on linguistic and cultural differences, and also related to their places of origin, type of area of settlement, and long-standing relationships with other peoples. these nations are: Saibailgal (Top Western Islanders), Maluilgal (Mid-Western Islanders), Kaurareg (Lower Western Islanders), Kulkalgal (Central Islanders) and Meriam Le (Eastern Islanders). *Torres Shire Council official website (Queensland Government): Five major island clusters ‚Äì the Top Western Group (Boigu, Dauan and Saibai), the Near Western Group (Badu, Mabuiag and Moa), the Central Group (Yam, Warraber, Coconut and Masig), the Eastern Group (Murray, Darnley and Stephen), and the TI Group (Thursday Island, Horn, Hammond, Prince of Wales and Friday). Ethno- linguistic groups found on Wikipedia: *Badu people, based on the central-west Badu island *Kaurareg people, lower Western Islanders, based on the Muralag (Prince of Wales Island) group. *Mabuiag (or Mabuygiwgal) people, across a number of the islands. *Meriam people, who living on a number of inner eastern islands, including Mer (also known as Murray Island). Languages There are two distinct Indigenous languages spoken on the Islands, as well as a creole language. The Western-central Torres Strait Language, or Kalaw Lagaw Ya, is spoken on the southwestern, western, northern and central islands; a further dialect, Kala Kawa Ya (Top Western and Western) may be distinguished. It is a member of the Pama-Nyungan family of languages of Australia. Meriam Mir is spoken on the eastern islands. It is one of the four Eastern Trans-Fly languages, the other three being spoken in Papua New Guinea. Torres Strait Creole, an English-based creole language, is also spoken. Culture Ritual face mask from a Torres Strait Island (19th century). Archaeological, linguistic and folk history evidence suggests that the core of Island culture is Papuo-Austronesian. The people are agriculturalists as well as engaging in hunting and gathering. Dugong, turtles, crayfish, crabs, shellfish, reef fish and wild fruits and vegetables were traditionally hunted and collected and remain an important part of their subsistence lifestyle. Traditional foods play an important role in ceremonies and celebrations even when they do not live on the islands. Dugong and turtle hunting as well as fishing are seen as a way of continuing the Islander tradition of being closely associated with the sea. The islands have long history of trade and interactions with explorers from other parts of the globe, both east and west, which has influenced their lifestyle and culture. The Indigenous people of the Torres Strait have a distinct culture which has slight variants on the different islands where they live. Cultural practices share similarities with Australian Aboriginal and Papuan culture. Historically, they have an oral culture, with stories handed down and communicated through song, dance and ceremonial performance. As a seafaring people, sea, sky and land feature strongly in their stories and art. Post-colonisation history has seen new cultural influences on the people, most notably the place of Christianity. After the \\"Coming of Light\\" (see Religion section), artefacts previously important to their ceremonies lost their relevance, instead replaced by crucifixes and other symbols of Christianity. In some cases the missionaries prohibited the use of traditional sacred objects, and eventually production ceased. Missionaries, anthropologists and museums \\"collected\\" a huge amount of material: all of the pieces collected by missionary Samuel McFarlane, were in London and then split between three European museums and a number of mainland Australian museums. In 1898‚Äì9, British anthropologist Alfred Cort Haddon collected about 2000 objects, convinced that hundreds of art objects collected had to be saved from destruction by the zealous Christian missionaries intent on obliterating the religious traditions and ceremonies of the native islanders. Film footage of ceremonial dances was also collected. The collection at Cambridge University is known as the Haddon Collection and is the most comprehensive collection of Torres Strait Islander artefacts in the world. During the first half of the 20th century, Torres Strait Islander culture was largely restricted to dance and song, weaving and producing a few items for particular festive occasions. In the 1960s and 1970s, researchers trying to salvage what was left of traditional knowledge from surviving elders influenced the revival of interest in the old ways of life. An Australian historian, Margaret Lawrie, employed by the Queensland State Library, spent much time travelling the Islands, speaking to local people and recording their stories, which have since influenced visual art on the Islands. =Art= Mythology and culture, deeply influenced by the ocean and the natural life around the islands, have always informed traditional artforms. Featured strongly are turtles, fish, dugongs, sharks, seabirds and saltwater crocodiles, which are considered totemic beings. Torres Strait Islander people are the only culture in the world to make turtleshell masks, known as krar (turtleshell) in the Western Islands and le-op (human face) in the Eastern Islands. Prominent among the artforms is wame (alt. wameya), many different string figures.Alfred Cort Haddon, along with one of his daughters, the pioneers in the modern study of Torres Strait string figuresA string figure bibliography including examples from Torres Strait. Elaborate headdresses or dhari (also spelt dari), as featured on the Torres Strait Islander Flag, are created for the purposes of ceremonial dances. The Islands have a long tradition of woodcarving, creating masks and drums, and carving decorative features on these and other items for ceremonial use. From the 1970s, young artists were beginning their studies at around the same time that a significant re-connection to traditional myths and legends was happening. Margaret Lawrie's publications, Myths and Legends of the Torres Strait (1970) and Tales from the Torres Strait (1972), reviving stories which had all but been forgotten, influenced the artists greatly. While some of these stories had been written down by Haddon after his 1898 expedition to the Torres Strait, many had subsequently fallen out of use or been forgotten. In the 1990s a group of younger artists, including the award-winning Dennis Nona (b.1973), started translating these skills into the more portable forms of printmaking, linocut and etching, as well as larger scale bronze sculptures. Other outstanding artists include Billy Missi (1970-2012), known for his decorated black and white linocuts of the local vegetation and eco-systems, and Alick Tipoti (b.1975). These and other Torres Strait artists have greatly expanded the forms of Indigenous art within Australia, bringing superb Melanesian carving skills as well as new stories and subject matter. The College of Technical and Further Education on Thursday Island was a starting point for young Islanders to pursue studies in art. Many went on to further art studies, especially in printmaking, initially in Cairns, Queensland and later at the Australian National University in what is now the School of Art and Design. Other artists such as Laurie Nona, Brian Robinson, David Bosun, Glen Mackie, Joemen Nona, Daniel O'Shane and Tommy Pau are known for their printmaking work. An exhibition of Alick Tipoti's work, titled Zugubal, was mounted at the Cairns Regional Gallery in July 2015. =Music and dance= For Torres Strait Islander people, singing and dancing is their \\"literature\\" ‚Äì \\"the most important aspect of Torres Strait lifestyle. The Torres Strait Islanders preserve and present their oral history through songs and dances;...the dances act as illustrative material and, of course, the dancer himself is the storyteller‚Äù (Ephraim Bani, 1979). There are many songs about the weather; others about the myths and legends; life in the sea and totemic gods; and about important events. \\"The dancing and its movements express the songs and acts as the illustrative material\\". Dance is also major form of creative and competitive expression. \\"Dance machines\\" (hand held mechanical moving objects), clappers and headdresses (dhari/dari) enhance the dance performances. Dance artefacts used in the ceremonial performances relate to Islander traditions and clan identity, and each island group has its own performances. Artist Ken Thaiday Snr is renowned for his elaborately sculptured dari, often with moving parts and incorporating the hammerhead shark, a powerful totem. Christine Anu is an ARIA Award-winning singer- songwriter of Torres Strait Islander heritage, who first became popular with her cover version of the song \\"My Island Home\\" (first performed by the Warumpi Band). Religion and beliefs The people still have their own traditional belief systems. Stories of the Tagai represent Torres Strait Islanders as sea people, with a connection to the stars, as well as a system of order in which everything has its place in the world. They follow the instructions of the Tagai. Some Torres Strait Islander people share beliefs similar to the Aboriginal peoples' Dreaming and \\"Everywhen\\" concepts, passed down in oral history. From the 1870s, Christianity spread throughout the islands, and it remains strong today among Torres Strait Islander people everywhere. The London Missionary Society mission led by Rev. Samuel Macfarlane arrived on Erub (Darnley Island) on 1 July 1871, establishing its first base in the region there. The Islanders refer to this as \\"The Coming of the Light\\", or \\"Coming of Light\\" and all Island communities celebrate the occasion annually on 1 July. However the coming of Christianity did not spell the end of the people's traditional beliefs; their culture informed their understanding of the new religion, as the Christian God was welcomed and the new religion was integrated into every aspect of their everyday lives. In the 2016 Census, Australia's Indigenous and non-Indigenous population were broadly similar with 54% (vs 55%) reporting a Christian affiliation, while less than 2% reported traditional beliefs as their religion, and 36% reported no religion. A total of 20,658 Torres Strait Islander (out of a total of 32,345 population in Australia) and 15,586 of both Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal identity (out of 26,767) reported adherence to some form of Christianity. Traditional adoptions A traditional cultural practice, known as kupai omasker, allows adoption of a child by a relative or community member for a range of reasons. The reasons differ depending on which of the many Torres Islander cultures the person belongs to, with one example being \\"where a family requires an heir to carry on the important role of looking after land or being the caretaker of land\\". Other reasons might relate to \\"the care and responsibility of relationships between generations\\". There has been a problem in Queensland law, where such adoptions are not legally recognised by the state's Succession Act 1981, with one issue being that adopted children are not able to take on the surname of their adoptive parents. On 17 July 2020 the Queensland Government introduced a bill in parliament to legally recognise the practice.

It may be defined conveniently by means of field theory, as the transformation on minimal polynomials implied by a different choice of primitive element. This is the most general transformation of an irreducible polynomial that takes a root to some rational function applied to that root. In detail, let K be a field, and P(t) a polynomial over K. If P is irreducible, then the quotient ring of the polynomial ring K[t] by the principal ideal generated by P, :K[t]/(P(t)) = L, is a field extension of K. We have :L = K(Œ±) where Œ± is t modulo (P). That is, any element of L is a polynomial in Œ±, which is thus a primitive element of L. There will be other choices Œ≤ of primitive element in L: for any such choice of Œ≤ we will have by definition: :Œ≤ = F(Œ±), Œ± = G(Œ≤), with polynomials F and G over K. Now if Q is the minimal polynomial for Œ≤ over K, we can call Q a Tschirnhaus transformation of P. Therefore the set of all Tschirnhaus transformations of an irreducible polynomial is to be described as running over all ways of changing P, but leaving L the same. This concept is used in reducing quintics to Bring-Jerrard form, for example. There is a connection with Galois theory, when L is a Galois extension of K. The Galois group may then be considered as all the Tschirnhaus transformations of P to itself.

He spent one season in the Canadian Football League (CFL), and one season in the United Football League (UFL). After playing college football for Rutgers, he was drafted by the Detroit Lions in the fifth round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He played for the Lions for four seasons from 2001 to 2004, and for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2005. McMahon played for the Toronto Argonauts and Montreal Alouettes of the CFL in 2007. He signed with the California Redwoods of the UFL in 2009 and played for the Virginia Destroyers from 2011 to 2012. He last played for the Uppsala 86ers of the Swedish Superseries in 2013. Early years McMahon played at North Allegheny High School in Wexford, Pennsylvania, where he became the starting quarterback during his senior year in 1996. He graduated in 1997. While in high school, he was featured in an NFL Films Presents episode as a potential next premiere quarterback to originate from Western Pennsylvania. College career McMahon attended college at Rutgers University. Though he started all four years (1997‚Äì2000), he sat out some games during the 1999 and 2000 seasons due to shoulder injuries. He participated in the 2000 Blue‚ÄìGray Football Classic and in the 2001 Senior Bowl. He left school as the all-time leader in passing and he was the first Scarlet Knight quarterback to be drafted in the NFL Draft. Professional career =Detroit Lions= McMahon was drafted in the fifth round (149th overall) in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions, who had traded their sixth- and seventh-round picks to the New England Patriots to take him. The Patriots used those picks to select tight end Arther Love and kicker Owen Pochman. McMahon began the 2001 season as the third-string quarterback behind starter Charlie Batch and backup Ty Detmer. However, after Batch suffered a season-ending injury during a December 2 game against the Chicago Bears, McMahon was inserted as the starting quarterback and served in that role for the Lions' first victory of the season against the Minnesota Vikings on December 16. He made seven total appearances and started three games for Detroit in his rookie campaign. The Lions drafted University of Oregon quarterback Joey Harrington with the third overall pick in the 2002 NFL Draft, but McMahon was named the starting quarterback to begin the 2002 season. After two straight losses as the starter, McMahon was benched in favor of Harrington before the third game of the season. McMahon took over in the last three games of the season due to Harrington having an irregular heartbeat. McMahon began the 2003 season as the backup to Harrington, and only saw action in two games during the season. The Lions re-signed McMahon to a one-year contract on April 1, 2004. In 2004, he was again the backup to Harrington, and played in one game to replace him. =Philadelphia Eagles= McMahon signed a two-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on March 12, 2005, reuniting him with former Lions' head coach Marty Mornhinweg, who was now working as the Eagles' assistant head coach. McMahon started the 2005 season as the third-string quarterback behind starter Donovan McNabb and backup Koy Detmer. With McNabb undergoing season-ending sports hernia surgery following a November 14 game against the Dallas Cowboys, McMahon took over the reins of the Eagles for the remainder of the season. On December 24, 2005, he became the first Eagles quarterback to rush for two touchdowns in a single game since Randall Cunningham in 1992. After taking over for McNabb, McMahon compiled a record of two wins and five losses in the games he started. His quarterback rating was 55.2 for the season. He was released on March 20, 2006, three days after the team signed quarterback Jeff Garcia. =Minnesota Vikings= McMahon was signed to a two-year contract by the Minnesota Vikings on March 23, 2006, a move which reunited him with then-Vikings head coach Brad Childress, who was previously the offensive coordinator in Philadelphia. McMahon lost a training camp battle for the third-string job with fellow quarterbacks Tarvaris Jackson and Brooks Bollinger. He was cut on September 2, 2006, after posting a 23.7 passer rating in the preseason, the second worst rating in the league. He was worked out by the Cleveland Browns a few days later but not signed. =Canadian Football League= On February 20, 2007, McMahon signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. McMahon started the 2007 CFL season as the third-string quarterback despite a strong showing in the preseason. However, an injury to Michael Bishop bumped McMahon to starting quarterback. His stint as a starter lasted only two games before being replaced by Damon Allen as the acting starting quarterback for the team. On September 9, 2008, McMahon was traded to the Montr√©al Alouettes. In return, the Toronto Argonauts received a sixth round draft pick in the 2009 CFL draft (used to select WR Tyler Scott). McMahon was cut on October 15 without having appeared in a game. =Later career= McMahon signed with the California Redwoods of the United Football League in 2009, and played for the Virginia Destroyers from 2011 to 2012. On March 28, 2013, McMahon signed with the Swedish team Uppsala 86ers. On June 1, 2013, in the season opener against the Carlstad Crusaders, McMahon sustained injuries to several ligaments of the knee and was later ruled out for the season having taken only two snaps for his new team.

Towns that share a common border with Nsukka, are Edem, Opi (archaeological site), Ede-Oballa, and Obimo. Other nearby towns including Aku, Enugu-Ezike and Uzo Uwani now are also referred to as Nsukka, because they fall into the political zoning system in Nigeria known as Senatorial Zone. As of 2006, Nsukka had a population of 309,633. Nsukka Town is known as the site of the University of Nigeria, the first indigenous Nigerian university, founded by Late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, first President of Nigeria. Currently the town has a number of Federal Parastatals in the university such as NABDA, CBSS, and the Energy Research Centre.  Recognized Traditional Rulers  In Nsukka cultural settings, the following traditional rulers most be observed: Onyishi,Oha/ndi-ishi,Umuada and Igwe. The LGA Nsukka LGA has an area of 1,810 km¬≤ and a population of 309,633 at the 2006 census. The Local Government Headquarters is located in the hilly and green sites which Nsukka is known for close to colonial quarters of the pre-Independence years. The current substantive Chairman of Nsukka Local Government is Hon. Barr. Cosmas Ibeziako Ugwueze, the former Deputy Chairman of the council. He succeeded Hon. Patrick Omeje who died in the early hours of Monday, June 15, 2020. The postal code of the area is 410001 and 410002 respectively referring to University of Nigeria Campus, and Nsukka Urban.  History  Nsukka is home to members of the Igbo ethnic group. Little is known about the history of Nsukka town except that the Kingdom of Nri had contact with Nsukka in earlier periods. However, in the book 'Igbo/Igala Borderland' the ancient American writer traced the origin of Nsukka town to the earlier traders from Arochukwu in the present Abia State, who initially rested and later settled there. Nsukka's Ancient Wars Nsukka in the 18th and 19th century had one of the best fighting forces in present day Enugu-North which they employed in waging war against their neighbours in order to gain more territories for their rising population and for other purposes. Each community that made up the town of Nsukka had stationed in them a fighting force made up of people from that community. Nsukka's numerous wars with her neighbours were usually successful such that some surrounding communities requested help from Nsukka to protect them from their attackers. One of such wars Nsukka waged with her neighbours was the war against Ede-Oballa. Nsukka, continuing on its expansionist campaigns annexed a village in Ede-Oballa called Ikeagwu. This war which was led by Arua Ugwoke, a highly revered commander, was halted after Ikeagwu was taken as a result of the death of the commander. He is believed to have mysteriously died after underestimating the powers of a protective charm prepared by Ede-Oballa to help them win the war. His death thus ended Nsukka's advance in Ikeagwu. Another instance of Nsukka's expansionist bid was the war with Ejuona-Obukpa (a community in Obukpa) which eventually ended in the annexing of a part of Ejuona-Obukpa. According to D. C. Ugwu, this war should not be viewed as one between Nsukka and the entire Obukpa as Ejuona (the involved community) refused the assistance of the rest of Obukpa. By the time the war ended, Nsukka succeeded in taking parts of Ejuona-Obukpa, almost wiping out one village (Umugboguru) of all its inhabitants in the process. The Biafran War In July 1967, Nsukka was one of the first Biafran towns to be captured by the Nigerian forces during their so-called 'police action' at the outset of the Nigerian-Biafran War. This action, during which University of Nigeria, Nsukka was burned down, created many refugees and contributed to the chaos and suffering inherent in this bloody conflict. According to Benjamin Chinweike Ezema (now called Ezemmah) Nsukka is a town that is made up of three prominent communities, namely the Nkpunanor community, the Ihe n'Owerre community and the Nru Nsukka community. Each of these communities are made of villages headed by an Onyishi (village heads are known as Onyishi) and other title holders. Oral history has it that Nsukka has very close ties with three other neighbouring towns: Obukpa, Okpuje and Eha, which are said to have common ancestral origins. Nsukka, Obukpa, and Okpuje are siblings of Asadu Ideke Arumona; while the last ‚Äì Eha is a patrilineal brother of the other three relations. The town is therefore called Eha-Alumona. Nsukka town has very ancient culture and traditions that are almost lost in antiquity due to the late awakening of the indigenes to the relevance and necessity of the pursuit of intellectual erudition and research. Each community is composed of many other smaller villages and clans. Renata Adler, \\"Letter from Biafra\\", The New Yorker, 4 October 1969. Prof Roseline Onah is the new chairman of Nsukka local government, who assumed leadership in early January 2016. Climate  Events and festivals  A number of festivals are celebrated by the people of Nsukka, including the Omabe Masquerade Festival;the Onwa Eto, or Onwa Ito (the 3rd moon) Festival, which is characterised by the slaughtering of several fowls in each household for each child in the household and in memory of deceased family members; the Onwa Ise (the 5th moon Festival ‚Äì which is also known as the moon that marks the beginning of the harvesting of yams (some people call it the New Yam Festival in English Language); Onwa Esa'a (the 7th moon Festival); the Onunu Festival which is a sort of carnival characterised by the going to the 'Nkwo' market Arena (where the 'Oromme' Dance, traditional wrestling, etc., was performed); The Onwa Esa'a (the 7th Moon Festival) is noted as the period for the commencement of the eating of dried cocoyam called 'echicha'. According to Benjamin C. Ezemmah, in the good old days, no one dares eat the 'echicha' before the day set for it which was usually a widely publicized and celebrated event in Nsukka town. Of the numerous festivals by which Nsukka was known, only the Omabe festival is still being widely celebrated in the town. Secondary education Nsukka has some of the most recognised educational institutions in south-eastern Nigeria. St. Teresa's College, Nsukka (all boys) is one of the oldest schools in Nsukka and is situated right at the heart of Nsukka township. It is run by the Catholic Church of Nsukka diocese.

The reserve is situated approximately northwest of Sydney and north of . The Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve is the core of the Macquarie Marshes. It is the area most frequently flooded and contains samples of all the habitat types present in the Marshes. Nevertheless, there are large and significant wetland areas outside the nature reserve, including extensive river red gum areas and some of the largest rookeries in the Marshes. Natural significance Macquarie Marshes Nature Reserve in July 2008. The marshes are created by irregular flooding of the flat lands along the river. The nature reserve extends over an area of almost , approximately 10% of the Macquarie Marshes floodplain. It consists of two main reserves, the North and South Marsh, and a third small reserve. The North and South Marsh Nature Reserves were listed as a wetland of international importance in 1986 under the Ramsar Convention of 1971. The Macquarie Marshes are also listed on the Register of the National Estate, the Register of the National Trust of Australia, and the Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia. The reserve is part of the Macquarie Marshes Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance as a breeding site for waterbirds. =Flora and fauna= The wetlands contain a wide range of vegetation types, primarily determined by the frequency and duration of flooding. The dominant types are river red gum forest and woodland, as well as extensive beds of common reed. Various vegetation associations are found throughout the wetlands, providing habitat for many species of waterbird, as well as other wildlife including 211 bird species, 8 species of native mammal, 15 frog, 56 reptile and 24 native fish species. The wetlands are one of the most important breeding sites in Australia for intermediate egret and straw-necked ibis. A number of birds are listed as vulnerable or threatened including the magpie goose, blue-billed duck, freckled duck, Australasian bittern, brolga, painted snipe, osprey, glossy black cockatoo, turquoise parrot, square-tailed kite and Major Mitchell's cockatoo. =Threats= The nature reserve covers only a small part of the marsh area. The rest of it is private agricultural holdings, utilised for the grazing of cattle and sheep, and cropping. The frequency and extent of the flooding required to sustain the marshes is threatened by increasing extraction of water from the Macquarie River for crop irrigation upstream from the marshes. An environmental trust has been established in order to attract widespread community support.

The southern part of the Mitchell Highway forms part of the National Highway A32 corridor, which stretches from Sydney to Adelaide via Dubbo and Broken Hill. The Mitchell Highway also forms part of the shortest route between Sydney and , via and Mount Isa; making it an important road link for the transport of passengers and freight for regional New South Wales and Queensland. In New South Wales, the Mitchell Highway's south-eastern terminus is at its junction with the Great Western and Mid- Western highways, and it links with the Golden, Newell, Oxley, Barrier and Kamilaroi highways. In Queensland, the Mitchell links with the Balonne and Warrego highways and its northern terminus is at its junction with the Landsborough Highway. The Mitchell Highway carries the A32 shield from its eastern terminus in to Nyngan; thereafter carrying the B71 shield north to the New South Wales and Queensland border; the A71 shield to ; and then to its northern terminus with the Landsborough Highway at Augathella, the Mitchell concurrently carries the A71 and Alt A2 shields. History Initially an amalgam of trunk routes, the Mitchell Highway was proclaimed a state highway in New South Wales in 1928 and named as the North Western Highway. On 9 October 1936 the name was changed to the Mitchell Highway, in honour of Lieutenant Colonel Sir Thomas Mitchell, who was Surveyor-General of New South Wales in the 1820s and explored much of inland New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Route The Mitchell Highway lies west of the Great Dividing Range and in New South Wales runs generally northwest‚Äìsoutheast and in Queensland, runs generally north‚Äìsouth in the central western and southwest parts of that state. From its northern terminus at a junction with the Landsborough Highway near Augathella, the Mitchell Highway heads south, concurrently carrying both the A71 and Alt A2 shields and continues south through Charleville where the Warrego Highway heads east, carrying the Alt 2 shield. As the A71, the Mitchell continues south through , forming a junction with the Balonne Highway, and then south to the state border between Queensland and New South Wales (called Barringun Road) where its highway shield changes to B71. Approximately north of it crosses the Darling River before heading into Bourke where it forms junctions with the Kamilaroi Highway heading east and the Kidman Way heading south. From this point the highway generally heads southeast through Nyngan where it forms a junction with the Barrier Highway. From this point until its southern terminus, the Mitchell carries the National Highway A32 shield. At the Mitchell forms a junction with the Oxley Highway, before passing through and then heads generally east to the major rural centre of Dubbo where it meets with the Newell Highway and connects to the Golden Highway before crossing the Macquarie River and heading south towards , again crossing the Macquarie River. At the Mitchell generally starts to head east towards , where an alternative route diverts many heavy vehicles away from the city centre. The portion of the Mitchell Highway that passes through Orange city centre is known as Summer Street. The Mitchell Highway's southeastern terminus is at a roundabout in Bathurst, at the junction of the Mid-Western Highway to and the Great Western Highway to Sydney via the Blue Mountains. Major intersections Truck explosion On 5 September 2014, a truck travelling on the Mitchell Highway rolled off a road bridge at Angellala Creek approximately 30km south of Charleville (). The truck was carrying 52 tonnes of ammonium nitrate which exploded. The blast destroyed the two road bridges and severely damaged the adjacent rail bridge. The blast was so powerful that the truck was disintegrated and the dangers posed by the remaining ammonium nitrate necessitated a 2km exclusion zone around the site for a number of days. The large crater formed by the blast closed the highway necessitating detours of up to 600km. The Department of Transport and Mains Road was allowed to commence work at the site on 13 September and by 23 September had constructed a temporary side track around the blast site suitable for cars, buses and light trucks. By 7 October, the side track had been upgraded to support road trains, ending the need to detour. In April 2015, the $10 million tender to reconstruct the highway and bridges were awarded and the construction work took place between June and November 2015. In early 2016, a competition was held to decide a new name for the bridge.

The fifth Lucky Santangelo novel, Dangerous Kiss, was published in 1999. =2000s= The 2000s turned out to be Collins' busiest time; she published eight best-sellers, more than in any other decade in her career. In 2000, Collins brought back the character of Madison Castelli in a new novel, Lethal Seduction. In 2001, she published Hollywood Wives: The New Generation, which was adapted as a 2003 television movie starring Farrah Fawcett, Melissa Gilbert, and Robin Givens. (Collins was credited as an executive producer.) A new Madison Castelli novel, Deadly Embrace, was published in 2002, and Hollywood Divorces was published in 2003. In 2004, Collins hosted a series of television specials, Jackie Collins Presents, for E! Entertainment Television. Collins in 2008 Collins continued with Lovers & Players (2006); the sixth Lucky Santangelo novel, Drop Dead Beautiful (2007); and Married Lovers (2008), which concerns the affairs of a female personal trainer named Cameron Paradise. This was followed by Poor Little Bitch Girl (2009), which stemmed from an idea Collins had worked on for a television series about heiresses that was ultimately never made. =2010s= Paris Connections (2010), a direct-to-DVD movie adapted from Collins' L.A. Connections series of mini-novels, was made by Amber Entertainment in association with the UK supermarket chain Tesco. The movie stars Charles Dance, Trudie Styler, and Nicole Steinwedell (as Madison Castelli). Collins served as co-producer, and three more Connections movies with the Madison Castelli character are planned.Jackie Collins ‚Äì Paris Connections, jackiecollins.com; accessed 20 September 2015. Collins continued to write Lucky Santangelo books, including Goddess of Vengeance. Her 29th novel, titled The Power Trip, was published in February 2013. Confessions of a Wild Child, was published in February 2014, with a movie deal announced even before the book came out. Collins' cookbook, The Lucky Santangelo Cookbook (2014), is named after the protagonist of seven Collins novels, who is often portrayed preparing elaborate gastronomic creations for her intimates (and who watched her father throw a plate of food at her mother as a child). Collins' final novel was The Santangelos (2015), a conclusion to the Santangelo series she had begun with Chances (1981). Personal life Collins held dual citizenship: British (by birth) and U.S. (by naturalization, from 6 May 1960). She married her first husband, Wallace Austin, in 1960; they divorced in 1964. Austin's addiction to drugs prescribed for manic depression ultimately caused their separation, and he died from a deliberate overdose the year after their marriage ended. The couple had one daughter, Tracy, born in 1961. In 1965, Collins married again, this time to American art gallery and nightclub (Ad-Lib and Tramp) owner, Oscar Lerman, who was twenty-five years her senior. The wedding took place in the home of her sister Joan and her husband at the time, Anthony Newley. Collins and Lerman had two daughters, Tiffany (born 1967) and Rory (born 1969). Lerman also formally adopted Collins' daughter, Tracy, from her previous marriage. Lerman died in 1992 from prostate cancer. In 1994, Collins became engaged to Los Angeles business executive Frank Calcagnini, who died in 1998 from a brain tumor. She said that what got her through the tragedies of losing two loved ones was \\"celebrating their lives, as opposed to dwelling on their deaths.\\"\\"Jackie Collins: Dealing with the Loss of a Loved One\\" , eharmony.com; accessed 20 September 2015. In 2011, when asked if she were dating anyone, Collins said: \\"I have a man for every occasion\\", adding: In 2013, she was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) Birthday Honours for services to fiction and charity. Throughout Collins' career, she fictionalized aspects of her personal life as a source for her novels. She said she loved Los Angeles and recalled that while growing up in England, she often read novels by Harold Robbins, Mickey Spillane, and Raymond Chandler. Vanity Fair writer Dominick Dunne explains that Collins \\"loved the picture business, the television business, the record business, and the people in them, the stars, celebrities, directors, and producers.\\" And although she was a \\"great partygoer\\", he says, she went to them \\"more as an observer than participant\\", using them as part of her \\"research.\\" \\"Write about what you know\\", Collins said at a writer's conference. \\"I love what I do. I fall in love with my characters. They become me, and I become them.\\" Death Collins died on 19 September 2015, of breast cancer, two weeks before her 78th birthday.Jackie Collins Has Died, people.com; accessed 20 September 2015. She had been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer more than six years before her death but kept her illness almost entirely to herself. She reportedly informed her sister Joan Collins two weeks before she diedJackie Collins Dead: Joan Collins Reaction, People.com; accessed 20 September 2015. and flew from Los Angeles to London to appear on the ITV chat show Loose Women nine days before her death.

Gilgal is mentioned 39 times, in particular in the Book of Joshua, as the place where the Israelites camped after crossing the Jordan River (Joshua 4:19 - 5:12). The Hebrew term Gilgal most likely means \\"circle of stones\\".Kotter, Wade R. (1990). \\"Gilgal (Place)\\". In David Noel Freedman, ed., Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary. Volume 2, p. 1022-1024. Its name appears in Koine Greek on the Madaba Map. Places named Gilgal in the Bible =In Joshua 4-5= Proposed location of Biblical Gilgal, in the modern-day West Bank According to Joshua 4:19, Gilgal is a location \\"on the eastern border of Jericho\\" where the Israelites encamped immediately after crossing the Jordan River. There, they erected 12 stones as a memorial to the miraculous stopping of the river when they crossed.Joshua 4 Joshua then ordered the Israelites who had been born during the Exodus to be circumcised at this spot. The Bible refers to this place as Givat Ha'aralot, then says that Joshua called the place Gilgal because, in his words, \\"today I have removed (galoti) the shame of Egypt from upon you.\\"Joshua 5:9 Some scholars speculate that the circle of 12 stones was the (unnamed) religious sanctuary that was condemned in Amos 4:4 and 5:5 and Hosea 4:15.Jewish Encyclopedia, Book of Joshua; Gilgal Gilgal near the village of Yafit =Elsewhere in Joshua= \\"The king of Goyim, of Gilgal\\" is listed as one of the 31 kings defeated by Joshua.Joshua 12:23 His city is identified by Eusebius with Jaljulia.https://amudanan.co.il/w/P139694 \\"Gilgal\\" is mentioned as a location on the border between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, near Ma'ale Adumim.Joshua 15:7 =In Deuteronomy= In the Book of Deuteronomy 11:29-30, Gilgal is a place across from Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. =In the Book of Samuel= A place named Gilgal was included in Samuel's annual circuit, and is the location where he offered sacrifices after Saul was anointed as king, and where he renewed Saul's kingship together with the people.1 Samuel chapters 7 and 11 Gilgal is where Samuel hewed King Agag in pieces after Saul refused to obey God and utterly destroy the Amalekites. On King David's return to Jerusalem after the death of his son Absalom, David traveled to Gilgal. From there he was escorted to Jerusalem by the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Again it is possible for this to be yet another \\"circle of standing stones\\" Strong's Concordance: Gilgal (or the same one as mentioned in relation to Elijah and Elisha, as Bethel is on the circuit with Gilgal, and other assumed locations show Gilgal to be far further away than the other two locations), and it is significant that it is treated as a holy place by the biblical text, rather than as a heathen one. =In the Book of Kings= In the Books of Kings, \\"Gilgal\\" is mentioned as the home of a company of prophets. The text states that Elijah and Elisha came from Gilgal to Bethel, and then onward to Jericho and to the Jordan, suggesting that the place was in the vicinity of Bethel, and far from Joshua's Gilgal near Jericho. Since \\"Gilgal\\" means a \\"circle of standing stones\\", it is quite plausible for there to have been more than one place named Gilgal, and although there are dissenting opinions, it is commonly held to be a different place from the one involved with Joshua; it has been identified with the village Jaljulia, about north of Bethel. It is significant that the Books of Kings treat it as a place of holiness, suggesting that stone circles still had a positive religious value at the time the source text of the passages in question was written, rather than having been condemned as heathen by religious reforms. Another opinion is that it is not different from the Book of Joshua, as it locates it near Bethel as does the Books of Chronicles. =In Hosea= God mentions Gilgal in his rebuke to Israel in the book of Hosea (). It is unclear which Gilgal is referred to. Gilgal as a geographic term The term gilgal is thought by modern archaeologists to refer to a type of structure, which may then receive additional names, for example \\"the gilgal by the terebinths of Moreh\\" (Deuteronomy 11:30) or \\"the gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho\\" (Joshua 4:19). Gilgal structures have been found only in the Jordan River valley, and in the Samaritan mountains on the edge of the desert. Pottery discoveries date them to the early Israelite period, with most remains from the 12th-11th centuries BCE. They are located on the lower slopes of a hill, have a footprint-shaped stone outline, and were used for occasional assembly rather than permanent dwelling. These sites are hypothesized to be ritual sites where the early Israelites celebrated holidays together, until worship was centralized. The footprint-shaped outline recalls ancient Egyptian symbolism in which a footprint symbolized ownership. The use of low slopes is in contrast to Canaanite practice, which placed sanctuaries \\"on every lofty hill\\" (2 Kings 17:10).Dror Eydar, In the footsteps of ancient Israelite kings, September 18, 2013http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/0024-D-61229-00.html References See also *Ancient underground quarry, Jordan Valley, possibly associated by the Byzantines with Gilgal and the \\"twelve stones\\" *Yom HaAliyah, Israeli national holiday created to honor the Jewish people carrying the Ark of the Covenant crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel at Gilgal as recorded in the Book of Joshua in the Bible.

Its purpose was to extend the powers of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 (which was incorporated by this Act), beyond the territorial land area and territorial waters of the UK to cover airspace and external bodies of water. The Act represented the UK's ratification of the 1965 \\"European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts Transmitted from Stations outside National Territories\\" (sometimes referred to as the \\"Council of Europe Strasbourg Convention\\" or \\"Strasbourg Treaty\\"). At the time that the Bill was introduced in Parliament in 1966, there were radio stations and proposals for television stations outside British licensing jurisdiction with signals aimed at Britain. These stations were anchored at sea but there were press reports of stations broadcasting from aircraft ‚Äì Caroline TV, and from a ship ‚Äì Radex TV. The Act extended to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (despite the protests of the Governments there). The Act meant that the operation of offshore, pirate radio stations became illegal if they were operated or assisted by persons subject to UK law. It prohibited \\"carrying by water or air goods or persons to or from it\\" which made tendering illegal. Station operators thought they could continue if they were staffed, supplied and funded by non-British citizens, but this largely proved impractical. Origins  In 1966, broadcasting in the UK was controlled by the British General Post Office, which had granted exclusive radio broadcasting licences to the British Broadcasting Corporation and television licences to the BBC and 16 regional Independent Television companies. The power of the GPO covered letters delivered by the Royal Mail, newspapers, books and their printing presses, the encoding of messages on lines used to supply electricity; the electric telegraph, the electric telephone (which was originally deemed an electronic post office); the electric wireless telegraph and the electric wireless telephone which became known as \\"telephony\\" and later wireless broadcasting. In the 1920s the GPO had been circumvented by broadcasting from transmitters in countries close to British listeners. World War II terminated these broadcasts except for Radio Luxembourg. Broadcasting pressure groups In the 1950s a pressure group campaigned with the help of Winston Churchill to pass the Television Act 1954 that broke the BBC television monopoly by creating ITV. Some members wanted commercial competition to radio but were thwarted by a succession of governments. By the 1960s several companies formed in the hope that radio licences would be issued. Radio monopolies in adjoining nations had been broken by transmitters on ships in international waters. The first attempt to broadcast offshore to Britain was by CNBC, an English-language station from the same ship as Radio Veronica broadcasting in Dutch to the Netherlands. CNBC ended transmissions but press reports followed that GBLN, The Voice of Slough, would transmit from a ship with sponsored programming already booked and advertised by Herbert W. Armstrong. GBLN was followed by reports that GBOK was attempting to get on the air from another ship, both ships to be anchored off south-east England. Many in these early ventures were known to each other. Some of the commercial television group members had registered broadcasting companies and were working to create offshore radio. The first venture was \\"Project Atlanta\\" in 1963, which had ties to British political leaders, bankers, the music industry and to Gordon McLendon, who had helped Radio Nord broadcast from a ship off Sweden. When that was put off the air by Swedish law it became available to British entrepreneurs. Before Radio Atlanta got on the air, Radio Caroline began broadcasting in March 1964. Texas connections to British stations led Don Pierson of Eastland, Texas to promote three American- radio format stations off Britain: Wonderful Radio London or Big L, Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio. By 1966 other stations had come on the air transmitting to Scotland, northern and southern England, or were in the process of doing so. Press reports included rumours of offshore television stations and the brief success of the Dutch REM Island operation called Radio and TV Noordzee heightened the fear of the authorities that de facto unregulated broadcasting was becoming so entrenched due to its popularity that it would not be possible to stop it. Existing laws  Although these stations maintained sales and management offices in Britain, the transmitters were not under British law. In many instances, the ships were registered in other countries. Claims of piracy Parliamentary debates listed several reasons why unlicensed broadcasting should be stopped. Opponents referred to \\"pirate radio stations\\". Allegations of piracy included misappropriation of World War II military installations; wavelengths allocated to others and the unauthorised playing of recorded music. Other claims said the vessels were a danger to shipping and that signals could interfere with aircraft and police, fire and ambulance services. Timing  In 1966, a dispute among offshore radio operators brought the issue of unlicensed radio stations to the fore. Reginald Calvert, operator of Radio City, had refused to pay Radio Caroline's operator Oliver Smedley for a substandard transmitter. Smedley hired some riggers to occupy the Radio City facility (on Shivering Sands, a disused offshore defence fort), and in an altercation at Smedley's house, Smedley killed Calvert. This incident strengthened the position of the Labour government of Harold Wilson, who wanted to bring the pirate stations under control, enough to see the passage of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act on 15 August 1967. Results The offshore stations fell into four groups: *Local operators of small stations such as Radio Essex and Radio City who conducted their businesses with limited budgets primarily from disused forts on offshore sandbars, plus the similarly based larger operation, Radio 390. The UK silenced these stations by bringing the sandbars within UK waters. * Regional operators such as Radio 270 and Radio Scotland who lacked the resources to relocate to other countries and staff their operations with non- British personnel. * The ship based stations of Wonderful Radio London, Swinging Radio England and Britain Radio. While Wonderful Radio London made money, the others had lost so they closed ahead of the law to save further expense. Radio London continued broadcasting until its last transmission on the eve of the new law. * The Radio Caroline ships announced they would move to Holland, with an advertising office in New York City. The reality was felt in early 1968 when two tugs representing the company supplying the ships with food, fuel, water, and spares towed the vessels away to satisfy debts.The pirate radio hall of fame \\"Radio Caroline in the sixties\\". Retrieved on 21 March 2018. Continuing challenges  Although challenges began with Radio North Sea International in 1970, the British governments (both Labour, then Conservative) jammed it until it moved to a position off the Netherlands. There was no Dutch equivalent of the Act until 1974; upon its introduction, RNI closed. Radio Caroline returned through the 1970s using the , a vessel that sank in 1980, then returned with a new ship, the , in 1983, primarily conducted with volunteer help. For much of this period Caroline's ships also hosted Dutch-language stations whose revenue, along with that of American evangelical broadcasts, kept the station on the air. In 1984 Caroline was joined by Laser 558 another station with American backing, and while the latter gained a huge audience, the legislation plus a sea embargo monitoring supplies out to its ship, MV Communicator, drove its operators into insolvency as well as putting additional pressure on Caroline. An attempt to revive Laser under new management only lasted a few months from 1986 to 1987. The arrival of Laser had increased knowledge of Caroline's presence, and its closure plus a change in Caroline's music policy resulted in an increase in their younger audience. Further amendments to the act had resulted in Radio Caroline having to move its operations into wilder water, and the Great Storm of 1987 damaged their antenna tower, which collapsed a few weeks later. A smaller antenna system was built but was less efficient. The Dutch and British governments then raided the Radio Caroline ship and removed much of its equipment, but again it limped back onto the air until late 1990 when, with its funding running low, the final amendment to the act, instigating a 200-mile limit, came into effect. Attempts to secure more funding proved futile, and thereafter it pursued legal means of broadcasting. Apparent conclusion of unlicensed British offshore radio The end of the offshore Radio Caroline came when the Broadcasting Act 1990, which built on all similar and related legislation, together with a storm that caused its staff temporarily to abandon the ship, caused the station to come ashore in 1991, where enthusiasts continue to build a broadcasting business using the new licensing system available to British broadcasters.

It is a customary meditation practice performed within the Sema, or worship ceremony, through which dervishes (also called semazens, from Persian ) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or karma. This is sought through abandoning one's nafs, ego or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on God, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the Solar System orbiting the sun. The Mevlevi practice gave rise to an Egyptian form, tanoura, distinguished by the use of a multicolored skirt. This has also developed into a performance dance by non-Sufis, including dancers outside the Islamic world.  Origin  Mevlevi dervishes whirling in Pera by Jean-Baptiste van Mour The whirling dervishes were founded by Jelaluddin Rumi (1207-1273). \\"In the 12th century, Sufi fraternities ( ·π≠arƒÅ æiq) were first organized as an established leadership in which a member followed a prescribed discipline in service to a sheikh or master in order to establish rapport with him.\\"\\"Dervish.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2009. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 21 Sept. 2009 Dervish A member of such a fraternity is referred to as a Persian darwish. These turuk (plural of tariqa) were responsible for organizing an Islamic expression of religious life, often founded by independent saints or resulted from the division of existing orders.MacDonald, D.B. \\"Darwish (Darwesh).\\" Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition. Edited by: P.B. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2009. Brill Online. Augustana. 21 September 2009. Darwish (Darwesh) Each Sufi tariqa stems from a unique silsila, or \\"chain of order\\" in which a member must learn, as the silsila binds each member to Allah through one's chain of order. One's silsila extends through the member's individual teacher, to their teacher and so on, through time until one is connected to the Prophet and thus Allah. The Prophet himself is revered as the originator of Sufism, which has in turn been traced down through a series of saints.  Practice  A dervish practices multiple rituals, the primary of which is the dhikr, a remembering of Allah. The dhikr involves recitation of devotional Islamic prayer. This dhikr is coupled with physical exertions of movement, specifically dancing and whirling, in order to reach a state assumed by outsiders to be one of \\"ecstatic trances\\". As explained by Sufis:The Whirling Dervishes of Rumi > In the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) > represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (tennure) > represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (hƒ±rka), he is > spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding > his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus > testifying to god's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm > is directed to the sky, ready to receive god's beneficence; his left hand, > upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen > conveys god's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving > from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with > love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevl√¢na > Jal√¢ludd√Æn Rumi says, \\"All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who > have not had a taste of it do not know!\\" Among the Mevlevi order, the practice of dhikr is performed in a traditional dress: a tennure, a sleeveless white frock, the destegul, a long sleeved jacket, a belt, and a black overcoat or khirqa to be removed before the whirling begins. As the ritual dance begins, the dervish dons a felt cap, a sikke, in addition to a turban wrapped around the head, a trademark of the Mevlevi order. The sheikh leads the ritual with strict regulations. To begin, > The sheikh stands in the most honored corner of the dancing place, and the > dervishes pass by him three times, each time exchanging greetings, until the > circling movement starts. The rotation itself is on the left foot, the > center of the rotation being the ball of the left foot and the whole surface > of the foot staying in contact with the floor.

Turkish whirling dervishes of Mevlevi Order, bowing in unison during the Sema ceremony The Western world, having witnessed Sufi whirling through tourism, have described the various forms of dhikr as \\"barking, howling, dancing, etc.\\" The practice of each tariqa is unique to its individual order, specific traditions and customs may differ across countries. The same tariqa in one country will not mirror that of another country as each order's ritual stresses \\"emotional religious life\\" in various forms. The Mevleviyah order, like many others, practice the dhikr by performing a whirling meditation. Accompanying the dhikr practices of whirling and prayer, the custom of sama serves to further one's \\"nourishment of the soul\\" through devotional \\"hearing\\" of the \\"'subtle' sounds of the hidden world or of the cosmos.\\"During, J.; Sellheim, R. \\"Sama\\".

Augustana. 21 Sept. 2009 Sama In contrast to the use of sama, whirling and devotional prayer in the practice of dhikr, the tariqa orders perform Sufi whirling in addition to playing musical instruments, consuming glowing embers, live scorpions and glass, puncturing body parts with needles and spikes, or practicing clairvoyance and levitation. The dervish practice can be performed by community residents or lay members, members have typically been those of lower classes. Within Islamic faith, unlike Middle Eastern law, women have equal status to men, allowing women to participate in dhikr as dervishes themselves. Women were received into a tariqa order by a male sheikh, but traditionally were instructed to practice the dhikr alone or with an established branch of females within a specific order. Sufi whirling, a worship of dhikr, became a gender and class neutral practice throughout the Central Islamic region. The custom of sama among Sufi orders has a history of controversy within the Islamic faith. In one argument, the use of the term sama is considered to suggest physically \\"listening\\" in a spiritual context. A differing opinion argues that sama is in fact \\"hearing\\", as \\"to hear\\" can pertain to any sound in addition to any \\"subtle\\" sounds of the spiritual realm. Those in support of sama further claim that the term is actually synonymous with \\"understanding\\" and therefore recognition and application of the Revelation as well as the act of \\"attaining higher knowledge.\\" The spread of sama among Sufi orders began some time around the mid 3rd/9th century C.E. in Baghdad, eventually finding acceptance and favor in Persian, Turkish and Indian Islam. The custom of sama evolved in practice over time as it complemented Sufi dhkir, whirling and among some orders dancing and a meal. Rules of propriety and conditions were adopted upon the widespread concern surrounding the necessity of sama with the dhikr; in order to distinguish between entertainment and valuable spiritual practice, the sama was distinguished as heard from the ego, heart or spirit. Despite the application of rules, some sheikhs continued to limit or disapprove the practice of sama. While controversy continuously questioned the place of sama in Sufi orders, the music itself was not affected. More recently, the custom of sama is most commonly performed within a dhikr ceremony. Those in support of sama continue to argue that \\"according to that which it is not sama and dance which induce ecstasy, but ecstasy which arouses dance, or furthermore, that sama is only a revealing instrument and that it only supplies that which is brought to it by the hearer.\\" In 2005, UNESCO proclaimed the \\"Mevlevi Sema Ceremony\\" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.The Mevlevi Sema Ceremony UNESCO.  Today  Dervish communities, in the Middle Ages, served a central role in social, religious and political life throughout \\"central Islamic lands.\\" Dervish orders were at one time much larger in size than they are today, as the government has taken control over most Dervish monasteries throughout this area. In 1925, Turkey ordered the dissolution of all Sufi fraternities by decree, the Mevlevi managed to survive among small villages throughout the Middle East. In 1954, the Turkish government granted the Mevlevi order a special permission to perform ritual whirling practices for tourists during two weeks each year. Outside of tourist entertainment, Orthodox theologians have now vocally discounted the Dervish practice resulting in faqirs, or wandering, mendicant dervishes throughout central Islamic regions. Despite strict government control over Dervish practices, the Mevleviyah order continued its existence in Turkey to this day.\\"Mawlawiyah.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2009.

Sema ceremony at Sirkeci Railway Station, Istanbul Regional and secular forms =Egyptian tanoura= Egyptian tanoura dancers In Egypt, the practice of whirling has been adapted as tanoura ( '). The word tanoura or tannoura refers to the colorful skirt worn by the whirler, with a color representing each Sufi order.Egyptian Folk Dance Tanoura at entertainment.feedfury.com The word may also refer to the dancer, traditionally a Sufi man. Tanoura is associated with Sufism and is performed at Sufi festivals, but it is also performed by non- Sufis as a folk dance or concert dance. Although it is mainly used for visual effects, the dancers also augment their balance with the tanoura, through a dynamic centrifugal effect. =Pakistan= In Sufi shrines in Pakistan, such as the Lal shrine in Sehwan, Sindh, the practice of Sufi whirling is called Dhamaal and is performed to honor Sufi saints, or qalandars. Unlike the Turkish practice, Dhamaal may be practiced by any devotee ‚Äì priests as well as pilgrims. Dhamaal is usually preceded by the beating of a drum (naghara) and ringing of bells, as pilgrims raise their hands, start to skip steps standing at one place and gradually work into a trance as the beats get faster. As the beats get faster, rhythms change and the drum beats are accompanies by the playing of shehnai. Practitioners associate the dance with Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and with protests following the Battle of Karbala. They regard the rhythm of the drum to evoke the rhythm of the creation of the universe, as illustrated in the concept of Kun Fyakun. =In the West= Whirling dancer, performing in a modern costume The tanoura tradition has attracted some interest from Westerners in the belly dancing community. These performers include both men and women, solo and in groups. Such performances may be augmented with pyrotechnics or props, such as veils, wings and ribbons. The techniques used in Egyptian Tanoura can also be adopted by belly dancers to help with their balance and control dizziness. Sufi whirling has also been promoted by actor and memoirist Annabelle Gurwitch as a form of stress relief.

(Page, Stephanie, MA, LMHC, \\"Modern Shamanism\\", Lesley University Press: Instagram: @studio17newbedford, 2020) Physiology A defining feature of whirling is continuous rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a central radical axis while avoiding vertigo. In untrained dancers, this sustained rotation causes dizziness or motion-induced vertigo. Training for whirling , which is responsible for balance functions in humans. To counteract this effect, whirling dance performers practice various balancing and psychological techniques. Records Guinness World Records for \\"most Sufi whirls in one hour\\" were awarded in London in 2012, to Shafik Ibrahim Abd El Hamed in the male category with 2,905 rotations, and Tara Lee Oakley in the female category with 2,191. These records were surpassed in Zurich in 2015 by Nicole McLaren, with 3,552 rotations. The longest continuous whirling performance has been recorded at more than four hours. The most people simultaneously whirling is 755, set in Taiwan in 2011.

It is in the broad fertile Cudgegong River valley north-west of Sydney. Mudgee is at the centre of the Mid-Western Regional Council local government area. As at June 2018 Mudgee had a population of 12,410. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. The Mudgee district lies across the edge of the geological structure known as the Sydney Basin. History = Indigenous Australians, pre-colonisation until 1850 = Historically, the Aboriginal heritage in Mudgee has not been widely told. The traditional custodians of the land were the Wiradjuri nation. The Wiradjuri nation was split and sub-split into many tribes. In Mudgee, the Mowgee clan extended over a 50 km radius. The Mowgee women's totem was the wedge tail eagle (Mullian) and the men's totem the crow (Waggan). They settled around the Cudgegong River, using its resources for food, and water. The Mudgee district holds many sacred Aboriginal sites and cave painting, some sites with evidence of tool making. Some of the better known and accessible sites include Hands on the Rocks; The Drip; Babyfoot Cave.  Significance of local names  Many Mudgee districts were named after the local Wiradjuri tribal areas, including Mudgee itself. The name Mudgee is derived from the Wiradjuri term Moothi meaning \\"Nest in the Hills\\" or \\"mou-gee\\" meaning \\"contented\\". Others include Lue (Loowee, 'a chain of waterholes'); Gulgong ('a gully'); Wollar ('a rock water hole'); Menah ('flat country'); Eurunderee ('a local tree'); Guntawang ('a peaceful place'), Cooyal ('dry country'); Wilbertree ('a long switch'); Gooree ('native chasing live animal'); Burrendong ('darker than usual'). The Aboriginal name of the Rylstone area was Combamolang. =Settlement to 1850= Mudgee post office James Blackman was the first European settler to cross the Cudgegong River in 1821 followed quickly by Lieutenant William Lawson who was then commandant of Bathurst. Lawson would later take up in the area. George and Henry Cox, sons of William Cox, were the first settlers on the Cudgegong River when they established the Menah run, 3 kilometres north of the current town. The European settlers were soon in conflict with the Wiradjuri over a range of issues including the killing of livestock and animals such as kangaroos and possums which were major food sources for the Wiradjuri. Martial law was declared by Governor Thomas Brisbane in 1824, leading to the killing of a large number of the Wiradjuri people. While the site of Mudgee was surveyed for a village in 1823, Menah was the original settlement having a police station and a lock-up by 1833. It has been incorrectly claimed that Robert Hoddle designed the village which was gazetted in 1838. Although Hoddle was the first surveyor in the region, marking out the boundaries of Putta Bucca and Bombira, by the time the village was gazetted, he had already left the district to become leader of the Port Phillip Survey. John Blackman built a slab hut, the first dwelling in Mudgee and its general store. By 1841, there were 36 dwellings, three hotels, a hospital, a post office, two stores and an Anglican church. St John's Church of England was consecrated on 6 May 1841. The police station moved from Menah in the mid-1840s while an Anglican school was established in that decade as well. =1850 to present= Mudgee Railway Station (1884) Lovejoy House View of Market Street, looking towards the centre of the town In 1851, the population of Mudgee was 200. However, the population skyrocketed as the discovery of gold in nearby Hargraves by Edward Hargraves led to a gold rush in New South Wales. While no gold was found in Mudgee itself, the town prospered as gold was discovered in nearby New South Wales towns such as Gulgong, Hill End and Windeyer temporarily reached populations of 20,000. Mudgee was a centre for the local goldfields and grew rapidly as a result. Mudgee was declared as a municipality in 1860 making it the second oldest municipality west of the Great Dividing Range with a population of 1500 in 1861. A public school was built in the 1850s together with the present Catholic and Anglican churches and a Methodist and Presbyterian church. A new police station, courthouse, Mechanics' Institute and a town hall were built in the 1860s. There were four coach factories operating in Mudgee to cater for the demand of the nearby goldfields. The National Trust of Australia has a number of these buildings registered including the Mudgee Museum (formerly the Colonial Inn), the Catholic presbytery, the court house, the police station and the Anglican Church. On 1 June 1861 the Electric Telegraph system arrived and was opened for messages to be transmitted and received at the Telegraph office. One of the gold miners attracted to the Mudgee district was Niels Peter Larsen who married Louisa Albury in Mudgee in 1866. They had a child, leading Australian poet Henry Lawson in Grenfell in 1867 and changed their names to Peter and Louisa Lawson. By the birth of their third child, they moved to a selection at Pipeclay (now Eurunderee) 8 km north of Mudgee. Louisa Lawson's vigorous lobbying led to the establishment of the slab-and-bark Eurunderee Public School in 1876 with Henry Lawson attending the school for the first time aged nine. He would later write about the school in his poem, The Old Bark School. Lawson would later attend St. Matthews Central School, Mudgee before his progressively worsening deafness leading to him leaving school at the age of 14. Lawson would live in the Mudgee district until the age of 15 and many of his stories were written about the district. As the gold mines petered out in the latter half of the 19th century, Mudgee was sustained by the strength of its wool industry as well as the nascent wine industry established by a German immigrant, Adam Roth, in the 1850s. The opening of the railway extension from Rylstone to Mudgee occurred on 10 September 1884. The railway boosted the town's agricultural industries. The railway between Rylstone and Mudgee closed on 2 March 1992. This same railway section re- opened eight years later, on 2 September 2000. The Wallaby Track Drive Tour visits various sites associated with Lawson including the old Eurundee Public School, the Henry Lawson memorial, the Budgee Budgee Inn, Sapling Gully, Golden Gully and the Albury Pub which was owned by Lawson's grandfather. In 1890 a local newspaper was founded with the title the Mudgee Guardian and North-Western Representative.Mudgee Guardian and North-Western Representative, trove.nla.gov.au. Retrieved 23 November 2019. Its title changed in 1963 to the Mudgee Guardian and Gulgong Advertiser and is currently published twice a week.

Economy Mudgee has developed as a wine producing region and wine manufacturing is a major part of its economy. It is also heavily dependent on several major mines in the surrounding area. Other rural produce includes cattle, sheep, wheat, alfalfa, olives, fruit, tomatoes, sweetcorn, honey, and dairy products. These, however, do not play as major a role as the mining industry. The Ulan coal mines are in the district. During the 19th century, the area was a major goldmining area and the district also produces marble, pottery clays, shale and dolomite. These mines have further potential to expand in the region, however they are also the topic of local environmental concerns. Tourism is also a growing industry based largely on the wineries. A laboratory was established in 1987 to test meat for pesticide residues. Local real estate, petrol and living costs skyrocketed since 2010 when the mining boom began to peak. This has rolled onto the local population, who have since had increased difficulty in living in the town. NSW Health is redeveloping the Mudgee Hospital. Major construction work commenced in March 2019 with the project due to be completed late 2020. Climate Mudgee has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with semi-arid (Bsk) characteristics. Summers are hot with the occasional thunderstorm, however nighttime temperatures are still cool. Winters are relatively cold, with frosty mornings and sunny days, interspersed with periods of heavy rain and, rarely, snowfall; Mudgee's heaviest snowfall on record was on 5 July 1900. Rainfall is moderate and falls fairly evenly all year round, with a slight peak in summer. Extreme temperatures have ranged from 43.9 ¬∞C (111.02 ¬∞F) to -8.3 ¬∞C (17.1 ¬∞F). The highest monthly rainfall ever recorded was 303.2 mm (11.9 in) of rain in March 1926. Mudgee gets 113.0 clear days, annually.

Tupper Martin Farquhar Tupper (17 July 1810 in London ‚Äì November 1889 in Albury, Surrey) was an English writer, and poet, and the author of Proverbial Philosophy. Early life Martin Farquar Tupper (1810‚Äì1889) (Arthur William Devis) Martin Farquar was the eldest son of Dr. Martin Tupper (1780‚Äì1844), a medical man highly esteemed in his day, who came from an old Guernsey family, by his wife Ellin Devis Marris (d. 1847), only child of Robert Marris (1749‚Äì1827), a landscape painter (by his wife Frances, daughter of the artist Arthur Devis). Martin Tupper received his early education at Charterhouse. In due course he was transferred to Christ Church, Oxford, where he took his degree of B.A. in 1832, of M.A. in 1835 and of DCL in 1847. At Christ Church, as a member of the Aristotle Class, he was a fellow student with many distinguished men, including the Marquess of Dalhousie, the Earl of Elgin, William Ewart Gladstone and Francis Hastings Doyle. Having taken his degree of M.A., Tupper became a student at Lincoln's Inn and was called to the Bar in the Michaelmas Term, 1835. However, he did not ever practice as a barrister. In the same year he married his first cousin once-removed Isabella Devis, daughter of Arthur William Devis, by whom he was to have four sons and four daughters. About the same period Tupper's literary career commenced. He contributed to the periodicals of the day, but his first important essay in literature was a small volume entitled Sacra Poesis. Albury History Society lists publications, sound recordings including a biographical talk by Tupper's grandson (invented fountain pen, safety horseshoe, instant tea, bulletproof tunic, steam driven paddle boat; predicted air travel, pioneered foundation of Liberia for freed slaves, formed Volunteer Corps, proposed tunnel to Isle of Wight, insisted first Morse code message through transatlantic cable was religious; moved to Crystal Palace shortly before death) and references to Tupper's life. Poetry and other writings In 1837 the first series of Proverbial Philosophy appeared, long series of didactic moralising composed in a lawyer's chambers in Old Square, Lincoln's Inn, during part of the previous year. Tupper had been encouraged to publish by Henry Stebbing. A typical example is: \\"Well-timed silence hath more eloquence than speech\\". His work met at first with moderate success in Britain, while in the United States it was almost a total failure. It slowly picked up steam, however. Over the next thirty years, by 1867, it passed through forty large editions in Britain, while nearly a million copies were sold in the United States. His blank verse is essentially prose cut up into suitable lengths; but Proverbial Philosophy contained apt and striking expressions and appealed to a large section of the public. In 1839, Tupper published A Modern Pyramid to commemorate a Septuagint of Worthies, being sonnets and essays on seventy famous men and women; in 1841 An Author's Mind containing skeletons of thirty unpublished books; in 1844, The Crock of Gold, The Twins, and Heart tales illustrative of social vices, and which passed through numerous editions; in 1847, Probabilities, an Aid to Faith, giving a new view of Christian evidences; A Thousand Lines, Hactenus, Geraldine, Lyrics, Ballads for the Times, Things to Come, A Dirge for Wellington, Church Ballads, White Slavery Ballads, American Ballads, Rifle Ballads, King Alfred, a patriotic play; King Alfred's poems, translated from Anglo-Saxon into corresponding English metres. In 1856, Paterfamilia's Diary of Everybody's Tour, The Rides and Reveries of √Üsop Smith, and Stephan Langton a biographical novel, which sought, with much graphic painting, to delineate England in the time of King John. He also published Cithara, a collection of Lyrics; Three Hundred Sonnets, A Phrophetic Ode and many other fugitive pieces, both verse and prose which appeared in various newspapers and magazines. In 1886, he published My Life as an Author. In 1845 Tupper was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He received the gold medal for science and literature from the King of Prussia. A genial, warm-hearted man, Tupper's humane instincts prompted him to espouse many reforming movements; he was an early supporter of the Student Volunteer Movement, and did much to promote good relations between Britain and America. He tried to encourage African literature and was also a mechanical inventor in a small way. Critic Kwame Anthony Appiah, however, has used a quote from Martin Tupper's ballad \\"The Anglo-Saxon Race\\" 1850 as an example of the predominant understanding of \\"race\\" in the nineteenth century. Tupper's ballad appeared in the journal The Anglo-Saxon containing the lines: \\"Break forth and spread over every place/The world is a world for the Anglo Saxon race!\\" Legacy =In literature and music= Tupper was recently quoted with some prominence in the biographical movie, The Life of Charles Spurgeon (2011) In the scene, Spurgeon reads from Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy on marriage and passes the book to his future wife (Susannah Thompson), to read the following quotation from the book: > Seek a good wife of thy God, for she is the best gift of his providence; Yet > ask not in bold confidence that which he hath not promised. Thou knowest not > his good-will :‚Äîbe thy prayer then submissive thereunto; And leave thy > petition to his mercy, assured that he will deal well with thee. If thou art > to have a wife of thy youth, she is now living on the earth ; Therefore > think of her, and pray for her; yea, though thou hast not seen her.' Sir William Schwenk Gilbert alludes to Tupper in Bab Ballads. In the poem Ferdinando and Elvira, or, The Gentle Pieman, Gilbert describes how two lovers are trying to find out who has been putting mottos into \\"paper crackers\\" (a sort of 19th Century \\"fortune cookie\\"). Gilbert builds up to the following lines, eventually coming up with a spoof of Tupper's own style from Proverbial Philosophy: :\\"Tell me, Henry Wadsworth, Alfred, Poet Close, or Mister Tupper, :Do you write the bonbon mottoes my Elvira pulls at supper?\\" :\\"But Henry Wadsworth smiled, and said he had not had that honour; :And Alfred, too disclaimed the words that told so much upon her.\\" :\\"Mister Martin Tupper, Poet Close, I beg of you inform us\\"; :But my question seemed to throw them both into a rage enormous.\\" :\\"Mister Close expressed a wish that he could only get anight to me. :And Mr. Martin Tupper sent the following reply to me:--\\" :\\"A fool is bent upon a twig, but wise men dread a bandit.\\" :Which I think must have been clever, for I didn't understand it.\\" The three other references are also recognisable (the Bab Ballad was from 1869 or so). They are Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Lord Tennyson (both still read and remembered), and \\"Poet\\" John Close, a well-meaning scribbler of the mid-Victorian period who wrote hackwork to honour local events (some samples are in the classic volume of bad verse, The Stuffed Owl, as is a good sample of Tupper's own work). Tupper was one of the worthies mentioned in the \\"Heavy Dragoon\\" song in Gilbert's libretto for the Savoy Opera Patience (1881)::\\"Tupper and Tennyson, Daniel Defoe\\" In Anthony Trollope's The Eustace Diamonds (1871), Lucy Morris attempts to read \\"Tupper's great poem\\" out of boredom when she's first at Lady Linlithgow's house. Karl Marx likens the \\"bourgeois\\" economic theories of Jeremy Bentham to Tupper's poetry. In Das Kapital (1867-1883), Marx writes: \\"Bentham is among the philosophers what Tupper is among poets. Both could only have been manufactured in England.\\" In March 1865, Marx filled in a page in the Confession book of his daughter Jenny; under \\"Aversion\\" he writes: \\"Martin Tupper, violet powder\\".https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1865/04/01.htm Edmund Clerihew Bentley wrote flippantly: \\"Martin Tupper / Sang for his supper. / Though the supper wasn't nice, / It was cheap at the price.\\" G.K. Chesterton mentions him in The Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare (1908). =In video games= In the video game, Alice: Madness Returns (2011), Alice retrieves a memory of her mother stating, \\"Whoever said 'There is no book so bad, but something good may be found in it' never read Martin Farquar Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy.\\" =Popular Song= John Rogers Thomas wrote a song using \\"All's for the Best\\" as the lyrics.

Singer Holm's pre-Collins singing career began with a psychedelic phase in the late 1960s before his high-pitched voice found its natural home doing Euro-pop. His best known song is \\"Monja\\" (aka \\"Monia\\" in the French version). Other songs included \\"Syster Jane\\" (a Swedish cover version of New World's \\"Sister Jane\\") and \\"You Will Be Mine.\\" Marriage Holm married actress Joan Collins 6 November 1985. Collins sought an annulment in December 1986 and was granted a final divorce 24 August 1987. According to Collins, the marriage quickly degenerated into a string of \\"interminable arguments... and hearty crockery-throwing rows.\\" She said Holm was a bully with a ferocious temper and \\"the most combative person I've ever met.\\" In December 1986, Collins received a restraining order against Holm. Undaunted, he gave interviews blaming Collins's identification with her Dynasty character. \\"Joan is consumed by Alexis, that's why she's doing this. She really loves me and I love her and we'll get back together, I know it.\\" He contested a pre-nuptial agreement, limiting him to 20 per cent of Collins's $5 million earnings during their 13 months together. Collins hired flamboyant divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson and the proceedings became a media circus. When Holm and his supporters picketed Collins' Beverly Hills house waving placards, he became a national punchline with jokes from David Letterman. At the trial, Mitchelson produced Holm's secret lover, an aspiring starlet called Romina Danielson, and grilled her so intensely she fainted on the stand. Holm lost his case, collecting only $80,000 as agreed in the pre-nup. A New York radio station hosted a fundraiser for him and he retreated to Switzerland. Soon after the divorce, Holm inherited money of his own. Collins gave her candid side of the break-up in Second Act, her second volume of memoirs, and subsequently referred to him only as \\"the Swede.\\" References Swedish male singers 1947 births Living people Singers from Stockholm ","title":"Peter Holm"},{"id":"595882","text":"Two U.S. Marines of the Maritime Special Purpose Force operating a Diver Propulsion Device (DPD) Two divers scootering with heavy duty DPVs A diver propulsion vehicle (DPV), also known as an underwater propulsion vehicle or underwater scooter, or swimmer delivery vehicle (SDV) by armed forces, is an item of diving equipment used by scuba divers to increase range underwater. Range is restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed, and the battery power of the DPV. Time limits imposed on the diver by decompression requirements may also limit safe range in practice. DPVs have recreational, scientific and military applications. DPVs include a range of configurations from small, easily portable scooter units with a small range and low speed, to faired or enclosed units capable of carrying several divers longer distances at higher speeds. The earliest recorded DPVs were used for military purposes during World War II and were based on torpedo technology and components. Structure A DPV usually consists of a pressure-resistant watertight casing containing a battery-powered electric motor, which drives a propeller. The design must ensure that the propeller cannot harm the diver, diving equipment or marine life, the vehicle cannot be accidentally started or run away from the diver, and it remains approximately neutrally buoyant while in use underwater. Application DPVs are useful for extending the range of an autonomous diver that is otherwise restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried, the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed, which is increased by exertion and diver fatigue, and the time limits imposed by decompression obligation, which depend on the dive profile. Typical uses include cave diving and technical diving where the vehicles help move bulky equipment and make better use of the limited underwater time imposed by the decompression requirements of deep diving. Military applications include delivery of combat divers and their equipment over distances or at speeds that would be otherwise impracticable. There are accessories that can be mounted to a DPV to make it more useful, such as lights, compasses, and video cameras. Use of a DPV on deep dives can reduce the risk of hypercapnia from overexertion and high work of breathing. =Limitations= DPV operation requires greater situational awareness than simply swimming, as some changes can happen much faster. Operating a DPV requires simultaneous depth control, buoyancy adjustment, monitoring of breathing gas, and navigation. Buoyancy control is vital for diver safety: The DPV has the capacity to dynamically compensate for poor buoyancy control by thrust vectoring while moving, but on stopping the diver may turn out to be dangerously positively or negatively buoyant if adjustments were not made to suit the changes in depth while moving. If the diver does not control the DPV properly, a rapid ascent or descent under power can result in barotrauma or decompression sickness. High speed travel in confined spaces, or limited visibility can increase the risk of impact with the surroundings at speeds where injury and damage are more likely. Many forms of smaller marine life are very well camouflaged or hide well and are only seen by divers who move very slowly and look carefully. Fast movement and noise can frighten some fish into hiding or swimming away, and the DPV is bulky and affects precise maneuvering at close quarters. The DPV occupies at least one hand while in use and may get in the way while performing precision work like macro photography. Since the diver is not kicking for propulsion, they will generally get colder due to lower physical activity and increased water flow. This can be compensated by appropriate thermal insulation. If the operation of the DPV is critical to exit from a long penetration dive, it is necessary to allow for alternative propulsion in case of a breakdown to ensure safe exit before the breathing gas runs out. Control of the DPV is additional task loading and can distract the diver from other matters. A DPV can increase the risk of a siltout if the thrust is allowed to wash over the bottom. History An Italian maiale type manned torpedo, at the Royal Navy Submarine Museum. Israeli manned torpedo. 1967.Human torpedoes or manned torpedoes are a type of diver propulsion vehicle used as secret naval weapons in World War II. The name was commonly used to refer to the weapons that Italy, and later Britain, deployed in the Mediterranean and used to attack ships in enemy harbours. The first human torpedo was the Italian Maiale (\\"Pig\\"). In operation, it was carried by another vessel (usually a normal submarine), and launched near the target. It was electrically propelled, with two crewmen in diving suits and rebreathers riding astride. They steered the torpedo at slow speed to the target, used the detachable warhead as a limpet mine and then rode the torpedo away. The idea was successfully applied by the Italian navy (Regia Marina) early in World War II and then copied by the British when they discovered how effective this weapon could be was after three Italian units successfully penetrated the harbour of Alexandria and damaged the two British battleships and , and the tanker \\"Sagona.\\" The official Italian name for their craft was \\"Siluro a Lenta Corsa\\" (SLC or \\"Slow-running torpedo\\"), but the Italian operators nicknamed it \\"Maiale\\" after their inventor Teseo Tesei angrily called it a pig when it had been difficult to steer. The British versions were named \\"chariots\\". Motorised submersible canoe The Motorised Submersible Canoe (MSC), nicknamed Sleeping Beauty, was built by British Special Operations Executive (SOE) during World War II as an underwater vehicle for a single frogman to perform clandestine reconnaissance or attacks against enemy vessels. Types  =Diver-tugs, tow-behind, scooters= The most common type of DPV tows the diver who holds onto handles on the stern or bow. Tow- behind scooters are most efficient by placing the diver parallel to and above the propeller wash. The diver wears a harness that includes a crotch-strap with a D-ring on the front of the strap. The scooter is rigged with a tow leash that clips to the scooter with releasable metal snap. =Swimmer delivery vehicles= A US Navy SEAL Delivery Vehicle, an example of the wet type of Swimmer Delivery Vehicle. Swimmer Delivery Vehicles (SDVs) are wet subs designed to transport frogmen from a combat swimmer unit or naval Special Forces underwater, over long distances. SDVs carry a pilot, co- pilot/navigator, and combat swimmer team and their equipment, to and from maritime mission objectives on land or at sea. The pilot and co-pilot are often a part of the swimmer team. An example of a modern SDV in use today is the SEAL Delivery Vehicle used by the United States Navy SEALs and British Special Boat Service. For long-range missions, SDVs can carry their own onboard breathing gas supply to extend the range of the swimmer's scuba equipment. SDVs are typically used to land special operations forces or plant limpet mines on the hull of enemy ships. In the former usage, they can land a combat swimmer team covertly on a hostile shore in order to conduct missions on land. After completing their mission, the team may return to the SDV to exfiltrate back to the mother-ship. For extended missions on land, a team can be re-supplied by contact with other SDVs. In the latter usage, SDVs can stealthily plant mines and other bombs on ships or port infrastructure and then retreat to a safe distance before detonating the explosives. In addition to destroying targets, the SDV can mislead enemies as to where they are being attacked from. One type of SDV‚Äîthe Mark 9 SEAL Delivery Vehicle‚Äîwas also capable of firing torpedoes, giving it the standoff ability to attack from up to away. The origins of the SDV stems from the Italian human torpedoes and the British Motorised Submersible Canoe used during World War II.Introduction to Naval Special Warfare =Manned torpedoes= These are torpedo or fish-shaped vehicles for one or more divers typically sitting astride them or in hollows inside. The human torpedo was used to great effect by commando frogmen in World War II, who were able to sink more than 100,000 tons worth of ships in the Mediterranean alone. Similar vehicles have been made for work divers or sport divers but better streamlined as these do not have warheads; the Dolphin made on the Isle of Wight (UK) in the 1971s is an example. Some Farallon and Aquazepp scooters are torpedo-shaped with handles near the bow and a raised seat at the rear to support the diver's crotch against the slipstream. The Russian Protei-5 and Proton carry the diver attached to the top. The New Zealand made Proteus is strapped onto the diver's cylinder. =Subskimmers= The Subskimmer is a submersible rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RIB). On the surface it is powered by a petrol engine, when submerged the petrol engine is sealed and it runs on battery-electric thrusters mounted on a steerable cross- arm. It can self inflate and deflate, transforming itself from a fast, light, surface boat to a submerged DPV. Started in the 1970s by Submarine Products Ltd. of Hexham, Northumberland, England, Subskimmer is now a tradename owned by Marine Specialised Technology. =Wet subs= As DPVs get bigger they gradually merge into submarines. A wet sub is a small submarine where the crew spaces are flooded at ambient pressure and the crew must wear diving gear. Covert military operations use wet subs to deliver and retrieve operators into harbors and near-shore undetected. An example is the Multi-Role Combatant Craft (MRCC). = Towed sleds = Towed diver sled with independently controlled planes These are unpowered boards (usually rectangular) towed by a surface boat which function as diving planes. The diver holds onto the sled and may use a quick-release tether to reduce fatigue. Depth control while submerged is by adjusting the angle of attack. Sometimes known as manta- boards, after the manta ray. Towed sleds are useful for surveys and searches in good visibility in waters where there are not too many large obstacles. The route is largely controlled by the towing vessel, but the diver has a limited amount of control over vertical and lateral excursions.

Retrieved 25 May 2008. It starts at Nevertire where it joins the Mitchell Highway. It links Nevertire, Warren, Gilgandra, Coonabarabran, Gunnedah, Carroll, Tamworth, Bendemeer, Walcha, Yarrowitch, Ellenborough, Long Flat, and Wauchope and ends at Port Macquarie on the coast of the Tasman Sea. The Oxley Highway starts from the Mitchell Highway at Nevertire before journeying to the Castlereagh Highway at Gilgandra, from where it is duplexed with the Newell Highway to Coonabarabran, thence to the New England Highway at Tamworth, with which it is duplexed to Bendemeer, the Thunderbolts Way at Walcha, and the Pacific Highway near Port Macquarie. The highway was formerly signed National Route 34 for its entire length, however during 2013 the route west of Coonabarabran was decommissioned and east to Port Macquarie signed as the B56 as part of the new system of alpha-numeric route marking in NSW. History Work commenced in 1838 with the use of convicts working from Port Macquarie towards a spot known as \\"Prisoners' Garden\\" about 20 km from Yarrowitch. Here it is said that the convicts were chained up each night. In 1842 the track from the Northern Tablelands to Port Macquarie was opened for the first time. Wool carried along this new route reduced the travelling time to 10 days, as opposed to 12‚Äì14 weeks for the trip to Maitland. The section from Walcha to Bendemeer existed as a mapped road in 1857, was surveyed in 1867, and proclaimed a Parish Road in c.1889. West of Walcha the road was only suitable for bullock teams and they too had difficulties, especially with the ranges.Donald, J.Kay, Exploring the North Coast and New England, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, 1978 The steep range section from Yarras to Yarrowitch was in serious need of repair in 1925 when the Main Roads Board was formed. Following a re-survey in 1927 the road was altered between Yarras and Tobins Camp. The Highway was named in 1928 to commemorate John Oxley who was the first European to explore much of inland New South Wales in 1818. On 30 September 1933 the Highway section between Walcha and Port Macquarie was officially opened. Walcha Shire maintained 106 km of the Highway until July 1966 when this part was taken over by the Department of Main Roads. About 45 kilometres of the Yarrowitch to Wauchope section is unfenced and livestock (cattle) may be encountered there, along with other wild animals on most of the highway. Kangaroos are the most likely of those to be spotted, but wombats and other marsupials may be found. Major intersections Gallery Oxley Hwy.JPGSigns, Oxley Highway.

Originally a timber castle, it was rebuilt in stone towards the end of the century. Dismantled in the 17th century after the English Civil War, the castle was restored in the 19th century, first by Anthony Salvin in the 1840s and then by the corporation of Newark who bought the site in 1889. The Gilstrap Heritage Centre is a free-admission museum in the castle grounds about the history of the town of Newark. History In a charter generally thought to date to 1135, King Henry I granted the Bishop of Lincoln permission to build a castle.Braun (1935) The charter reads Alexander also established a mint at the castle.Pettifer (1995), pp.148 & 201 This early castle was most likely of timber construction, and was rebuilt in stone towards the end of the century. King John died after a feast at this castle on the night of 18 October 1216 from dysentery, according to tradition from eating a \\"surfeit of peaches\\".Fryde, Greenway, Porter and Roy (1996), p.37Warren (1991), pp.254‚Äì255 The castle was slighted in 1648 and left derelict. Between 1845 and 1848 architect Anthony Salvin restored the castle, and in 1889 the corporation of Newark purchased the building and carried out further restoration work. The castle is a Scheduled Ancient Monument, a \\"nationally important\\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change.

It was the only asteroid discovery made by famous American astronomer Edwin Hubble, while observing distant galaxies at Mount Wilson Observatory in California on 30 August 1935. The rather spherical X-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.3 hours. It was named for the Cincinnati Observatory.  Orbit and classification  Cincinnati orbits the Sun in the outermost asteroid belt at a distance of 2.3‚Äì4.5 AU once every 6 years and 4 months (2,311 days; semi-major axis of 3.42 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.31 and an inclination of 39¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Mount Wilson in August 1935. Cincinnati, a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population, is located in the orbital region of the Cybele asteroid, the last outpost of an extended asteroid belt beyond the Hecuba-gap asteroids. Due to its high inclination, and contrary to all other Cybele asteroids, Cincinnati is the only one that is above the center of the ŒΩ6 secular resonance with Saturn. The asteroid's high inclination and eccentricity also results in a Tisserand's parameter (TJupiter) of 2.719, which makes it a true asteroid in cometary orbit (ACO) for having a TJupiter value below 3.  Naming  Recommended by the Minor Planet Center, this minor planet was named after the Cincinnati Observatory, whose staff provided most of the orbit computations. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 31 January 1962 ().  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Cincinnati is a Xk-type, a subtype that transitions from the X-type to the uncommon K-type asteroids, while the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer classifies it as a metallic M-type asteroid. By 2014, Cincinnati is the only of three Cybele asteroids for which a spectral type has been determined; the other two are 522 Helga and 692 Hippodamia, an X- and S-type, respectively. = Rotation period = In January 2018, a rotational lightcurve of Cincinnati was obtained from photometric observations by Henk de Groot. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.10 magnitude (). The low brightness amplitude is indicative that is asteroid is rather spherical than elongated in shape. Alternative period determinations were made by French amateur astronomer Ren√© Roy (5.274 h; Œî0.21 mag) in August 2004 (). Two more lightcurves were obtained by Brian Warner at this Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado, United States, in August 2004 and August 2010, who measured a period of 4.930 and 5.28 hours with an amplitude of 0.11 and 0.14 magnitude, respectively. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Cincinnati measures between 19.4 and 19.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.15‚Äì0.16, while the Japanese Akari satellite determined a diameter of 22.16 kilometers with an albedo of 0.12. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 27.9 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.5.

The chief authority for the legend of Amleth is Saxo Grammaticus, who devotes to it parts of the third and fourth books of his Gesta Danorum, completed at the beginning of the 13th century. Saxo's version is similar to the one given in the 12th-century Chronicon Lethrense. In both versions, prince Amleth (Ambloth√¶) is the son of Horvendill (Orwendel), king of the Jutes. It has often been assumed that the story is ultimately derived from an Old Icelandic poem, but no such poem has survived; the extant Icelandic versions, known as the Ambales-saga, or Amloda- saga are considerably later than Saxo.Israel Gollancz, Hamlet in Iceland : being the Icelandic romantic Ambales saga, (1898). Name The Old Icelandic form Aml√≥√∞i is recorded once in the Prose Edda. The 12th-century Amlethus, Ambloth√¶ may easily be latinizations of the Old Norse name. The etymology of the name is unknown, but there are various suggestions. Icelandic Aml√≥√∞i is recorded as a term for a fool or simpleton in reference to the character of the early modern Icelandic romance or folk tale. Henry Harrison, Surnames of the United Kingdom: A Concise Etymological Dictionary vol. 1 (1912), p. 184. One suggestionFerdinand Holthausen, Vergleichendes und Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch des Altwestnordischen, 1948. is based on the \\"fool\\" or \\"trickster\\" interpretation of the name, composing the name from Old Norse ama \\"to vex, annoy, molest\\" and √≥√∞r \\"fierceness, madness\\" (also in the theonym Odin). The Irish and Scottish word amhlair, which in contemporary vernacular denotes a dull, stupid person, is handed down from the ancient name for a court jester or fool, who entertained the king but also surreptitiously advised him through riddles and antics. A more recent suggestionLisa A. Collinson, 'A new etymology for Hamlet? The names Amlethus, Aml√≥√∞i and Admlithi', in: The Review of English Studies 62 (2011), 675-694 is based on the Eddaic kenning associating Aml√≥√∞i with the mythological mill gr√≥tti, and derives it from the Old Irish name Admlithi \\"great-grinding\\", attested in Togail Bruidne D√° Derga. Aml√≥√∞a kvern (\\"Amlodi's quern\\" or \\"Hamlet's mill\\") is a kenning for the sea in the Sk√°ldskaparm√°l section of the Prose Edda, attributed to a skald named Sn√¶bj√∂rn. I. Gollancz, Hamlet in Iceland, London, Northern Library, vol. 3., 1898, p. xi. \\"Tis said, sang Snaebjorn, that far out, off yonder ness, the Nine Maids of the Island Mill stir amain the host-cruel skerry-quern--they who in ages past ground Hamlet's meal.

Attention has also been drawn to the similarity of Amleth to the Irish name Amhladh (variously Amhlaidh, Amhlaigh, Amhlaide), itself a Gaelic adaptation of the Norse name Olaf.. In a stanza from the Irish Annals of the Four Masters, compiled in the 1600s, the Irish Queen Gormflaith laments the death of her husband, Niall Glundubh, at the hands of one Amhlaide at the battle of Ath-Cliath (919). The identity of the killer of Niall Glundubh is otherwise recorded as Sigtrygg Caech, the father of that Olaf Cuaran (i.e. Anlaf, gaelicized Amhlaide) who was the prototype of the English Havelok. In a controversial suggestion going back to 1937, the sequence √¶mlu√æ contained in the 8th-century Old Frisian runic inscription on the Westeremden yew-stick has been interpreted as a reference to \\"Amleth\\". Contemporary runic research does not support this conclusion. N.

(eds.), Aspects of Old Frisian Philology. Amsterdamer Beitr√§ge zur √§lteren Germanistik, 31/32, 365. Scandinavian legend It has frequently been assumed that the Scandinavian legend ultimately goes back to an Old Norse (Old Icelandic) poem of about the 10th century. But no such poem has survived, and the two 12th-century Latin versions of the story are our oldest source. There is an early modern (17th century) Icelandic version of the tale, and Thormodus Torf√¶us also asserts that a story of Amlodi was part of popular folklore in his youth (i.e. in the mid 17th century), but it is unclear whether the early modern Icelandic tale is substantially influenced by Saxo's account, or if it represents an independent tradition derived from the unattested Old Icelandic source. =Saxo's version= Briefly, Saxo's version of Amleth's history is as follows: Gervendill, governor of Jutland, was succeeded by his sons Horvendill and Feng. Horvendill, on his return from a Viking expedition in which he had slain Koll, king of Norway, married Gerutha, daughter of R√∏rik Slyngebond, king of Denmark; she bore him a son, Amleth. But Feng, out of jealousy, murdered Horvendill, and persuaded Gerutha to become his wife, on the plea that he had committed the crime for no other reason than to avenge her of a husband who had hated her. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father's fate, pretended to be an imbecile, but the suspicion of Feng put him to various tests which are related in detail. Among other things they sought to entangle him with a young girl, his foster-sister (the prototype of Ophelia), but his cunning saved him. When, however, Amleth slew the eavesdropper hidden, like Polonius in Shakespeare's play, in his mother's room, and destroyed all trace of the deed, Feng was assured that the young man's madness was feigned. Accordingly, he dispatched him to Britain in company with two attendants, who bore a letter enjoining the king of the country to put him to death. Amleth surmised the purport of their instructions, and secretly altered the message on their wooden tablets to the effect that the king should put the attendants to death and give Amleth his daughter in marriage. After marrying the princess, Amleth returned at the end of a year to Denmark. Of the wealth he had accumulated he took with him only certain hollow sticks filled with gold. He arrived in time for a funeral feast, held to celebrate his supposed death. During the feast he plied the courtiers with wine, and executed his vengeance during their drunken sleep by fastening down over them the woolen hangings of the hall with pegs he had sharpened during his feigned madness, and then setting fire to the palace. He slew Feng with his own sword. After a long harangue to the people he was proclaimed king. Returning to Britain for his wife he found that his father-in-law and Feng had been pledged each to avenge the other's death. The English king, unwilling to personally carry out his pledge, sent Amleth as proxy wooer for the hand of a terrible Scottish queen, Hermuthruda, who had put all former wooers to death but fell in love with Amleth. On his return to Britain his first wife, whose love proved stronger than her resentment, told him of her father's intended revenge. In the ensuing battle, Amleth won the day by setting up the fallen dead from the day before on stakes, thereby terrifying the enemy. He then returned with his two wives to Jutland, where he had to encounter the enmity of Wiglek, R√∏rik's successor. He was slain in a battle against Wiglek. Hermuthruda, although she had promised to die with him, married the victor. Saxo states that Amleth was buried on a plain (or \\"heath\\") in Jutland, famous for his name and burial place. Wiglek later died of illness and was the father of Wermund from whom the royal line of Kings of Mercia descended. =Chronicon Lethrense= The 12th-century Chronicle of the Kings of Leijre (and the included Annales Lundenses) tells that the Danish king Rorik Slengeborre put Orwendel and Feng as his rulers in Jutland, and gave his daughter to Orwendel as a reward for his good services. Orwendel and the daughter had a son, Ambloth√¶ the Jutlander. The jealous Feng killed Orwendel and took his wife. Ambloth√¶ understood that his life was in danger and tried to survive by playing insane. Feng sent Ambloth√¶ to the king of Britain with two servants carrying a message that the British king should kill Ambloth√¶. While the servants slept, Ambloth√¶ carved off the (probably runic) message and wrote that the servants should be killed and himself married to the king's daughter. The British king did what the message said. Exactly one year later, Feng drank to the memory of Ambloth√¶, but Ambloth√¶ appeared and killed him. He then burnt Feng's men to death in a tent and became the ruler of Jutland. Then he went back to Britain to kill the British king who wanted to avenge Feng's death, and married the queen of Scotland. Ambloth√¶ went back to Jutland and was killed in battle upon arrival. =Icelandic versions= In Iceland, the early modern Ambale's Saga is a romantic tale (the earliest manuscript dates from the 17th century). Thormodus Torf√¶us recorded in 1702 that he \\"often heard the story of Amlod related in Iceland by old women\\" in his youth.T.W., \\"Amleth\\" in The Biographical Dictionary of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1843. The folk-tale of Brjam was put in writing in 1707. In the Ambale's Saga there are, besides romantic additions, some traits which point to an earlier version of the tale. Also comparable is the medieval Hr√≥lfs saga kraka, where the brothers Helgi (known as Halga in Beowulf) and Hroar (Hro√∞gar) take the place of the hero (corresponding to the tale of Harald and Halfdan in the 7th book of Saxo Grammaticus); Helgi and Hroar, like Harald and Halfdan, avenge their father's death on their uncle by burning him in his palace. Harald and Halfdan escape after their father's death by being brought up, with dogs' names, in a hollow oak, and subsequently by feigned madness; and in the case of the other brothers there are traces of a similar motive, since the boys are called by dogs' names. Comparative mythology The similarities of Saxo's version with the classical tale of Lucius Junius Brutus as told by Livy, by Valerius Maximus, and by Dionysius of Halicarnassus are likely deliberate, as the incident of the gold-filled sticks could hardly appear fortuitously in both, and a comparison of the harangues of Amleth (Saxo, Book iv.) and of Brutus (Dionysius, iv. 77) shows marked similarities. In both tales the usurping uncle is ultimately succeeded by the nephew who has escaped notice during his youth by a feigned madness. But the parts played by the personages who in Shakespeare became Ophelia and Polonius, the method of revenge, and the whole narrative of Amleth's adventure in England, have no parallels in the Latin story. Further resemblances exist in the Ambale's Saga with the tales of Bellerophon, of Heracles, and of Servius Tullius. This concerns especially the episode of the \\"traitorous letter\\" (ordering the death of the bearer), also found in the Old French (13th- century) Dit de l'empereur Constant, and further afield in various Arabian and Indian tales.Chisholm (1911). There are also striking similarities between the story of Amleth and that of Kai Khosrow in the Shahnameh (Book of the King) of the Persian poet Firdausi. In ancient Egyptian mythology, a similar tale of a king who is murdered by a jealous brother but avenged by his son appears in the narrative of Osiris, Set and Horus. 16th-century reception Outside Scandinavia, the story of Amleth or Hamlet was popularized through Fran√ßois de Belleforest's French Histoires tragiques (Paris, Chez Jean Hupeau, 1572, Fueil 149), where it appears as the fifth story of the fifth volume. An English version, The Hystorie of Hamblet, was published in 1608. An English stage version, conventionally known as the Ur-Hamlet, appeared by 1589. The play is lost but is mentioned in a few other sources, the first being Thomas Nashe's 1589 preface to Robert Greene's Menaphon. William Shakespeare wrote his play Hamlet sometime between 1599 and 1602. The Ur-Hamlet is thought to be his primary source; his version owes but the outline of the story to Saxo. In character, Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet is diametrically opposed to his prototype. Amleth's madness was certainly altogether feigned; he prepared his vengeance a year beforehand, and carried it out deliberately and ruthlessly at every point. His riddling speech has little more than an outward similarity to the words of Hamlet, who resembles him, however, in his disconcerting penetration into his enemies' plans. Modern adaptations The legend was taken as the basis of a 1994 film by Gabriel Axel, Prince of Jutland (also known as Royal Deceit), with Gabriel Byrne as Fenge, Helen Mirren as Geruth and Christian Bale as Amled.IMDB entry. The legend, woven together with Shakespeare's play, form the basis for Alan Gordon's novel An Antic Disposition (2004), the fifth novel in Gordon's \\"Fools' Guild\\" series.

Two home-system sequels followed in Space Harrier 3-D and Space Harrier II (both released in 1988), and the arcade spinoff Planet Harriers (2000). A polygon-based remake of the original game was released by Sega for the PlayStation 2 as part of their Sega Ages series in 2003. Gameplay Arcade gameplay Space Harrier is a fast- paced rail shooter game played in a third-person perspective behind the protagonist, set in a surreal world composed of brightly colored landscapes adorned with checkerboard-style grounds and stationary objects such as trees or stone pillars. At the start of gameplay, players are greeted with a voice sample speaking \\"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone. Get ready!\\", in addition to \\"You're doing great!\\" with the successful completion of a stage. The title player character, simply named Harrier, navigates a continuous series of eighteen distinct stages while utilizing an underarm jet-propelled laser cannon that enables Harrier to simultaneously fly and shoot. The objective is simply to destroy all enemies‚Äîwho range from prehistoric animals and Chinese dragons to flying robots, airborne geometric objects and alien pods‚Äîall while remaining in constant motion in order to dodge projectiles and immovable ground obstacles. Fifteen of the game's eighteen stages contain a boss at the end that must be killed in order to progress to the next level; the final stage is a rush of seven past bosses encountered up to that point that appear individually and are identified by name on the bottom of the screen. The two other levels are bonus stages that contain no enemies and where Harrier mounts an invincible catlike dragon named Uriah, whom the player maneuvers to smash through landscape obstacles and collect bonus points. After all lives are lost, players have the option of continuing gameplay with the insertion of an extra coin. As Space Harrier has no storyline, after the completion of all stages, only \\"The End\\" is displayed before the game returns to the title screen and attract mode, regardless of how many of the player's extra lives remain. Development The game was first conceived by a Sega designer named Ida, who wrote a 100-page document proposing the idea of a three-dimensional shooter that contained the word \\"Harrier\\" in the title. The game would feature a player-controlled fighter jet that shot missiles into realistic foregrounds, a concept that was soon rejected due to the extensive work required to project the aircraft realistically from varying angles as it moved around the screen, coupled with arcade machines' memory limitations. Sega developer Yu Suzuki therefore simplified the title character to a human, which required less memory and realism to depict onscreen. He then rewrote the entire original proposal, changing the style of the game to a science-fiction setting while keeping only the \\"Harrier\\" name. His inspirations for the game's new design were the 1984 film The Neverending Story, the 1982 anime series Space Cobra, and the work of artist Roger Dean. Certain enemies were modelled on characters from the anime series Gundam. Suzuki included a nod to the original designer in the finished product with an enemy character called Ida, a large moai-like floating stone head, because the designer \\"had a really big head.\\" Three different arcade cabinets were produced: an upright cabinet, a sit-down version with a fixed seat, and its best known incarnation: a deluxe cockpit- style rolling cabinet that was mounted on a motorised base and moved depending on the direction in which players pushed the joystick. Sega was hesitant to have the cabinets built due to high construction costs; Suzuki, who had proposed the cabinet designs, offered his salary as compensation if the game failed, but it would instead become a major hit in arcades. Suzuki had little involvement with the game after its initial release: the Master System port was developed by Mutsuhiro Fujii and Yuji Naka, and they added a final boss and an ending sequence which were included in subsequent ports. The game was too successful for Sega to abandon the series, and other Sega staff, such as Naoto Ohshima (character designer for Sonic the Hedgehog), Kotaro Hayashida (planner of Alex Kidd in Miracle World), and Toshihiro Nagoshi (director of Super Monkey Ball) have had involvement in various sequels. In a 2015 interview, Suzuki stated that he would have liked to create a new Space Harrier by himself, and was pleased to see it ported to the Nintendo 3DS. =Hardware= Space Harrier arcade machine Space Harrier was one of the first arcade releases to use 16-bit graphics and scaled sprite (\\"Super Scaler\\") technologyJohn D. Vince (ed.) (2003), Handbook of Computer Animation (p. 4-5), Springer-Verlag, that allowed pseudo-3D sprite scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to display 32,000 colors on screen. Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used in Suzuki's 1985 arcade debut Hang-On, pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling is used for the stage backgrounds while the character graphics are sprite-based. Suzuki explained in 2010 that his designs \\"were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D.\\" The game's soundtrack is by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who composed drafts on a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and wrote out the final versions as sheet music, as he had no access to a \\"real\\" music sequencer at the time. A Zilog Z80 CPU powering both a Yamaha YM2203 synthesis chip and Sega's PCM unit that was used for audio and digitized voice samples. Space Harrier utilized an analog flight stick as its controller that allowed onscreen movement in all directions, while the velocity of the character's flight is unchangeable. The degree of push and acceleration varies depending on how far the stick is moved in a certain direction. Two separate \\"fire\\" buttons are mounted on the joystick (a trigger) and on the control panel; either one can be pressed repeatedly in order to shoot at enemies. Ports Space Harrier has been ported to numerous home computer systems and gaming consoles for over a quarter of a century, with most early translations unable to reproduce the original's advanced visual or audio capabilities while the controls were switched from analog to digital. The first port was released in 1986 for the Master System (Mark III in Japan), developed by Sega AM R&D; 4. The first two-megabit cartridge produced for the console, the game was given a plot in which Harrier saves the \\"Land of the Dragons\\" (rather than the \\"Fantasy Zone\\") from destruction, with a new ending sequence in contrast to the arcade version's simple \\"The End\\" message. All eighteen stages were present but the backdrops therein were omitted, leaving just a monochromatic horizon and the checkerboard floors. An exclusive final boss was included in a powerful twin-bodied fire dragon named Haya Oh, who was named after then-Sega president Hayao Nakayama. The 1991 Game Gear port is based on its Master System counterpart, but with redesigned enemies and only twelve stages, while Rutubo Games produced a near-duplicate of the arcade version in 1994 for the 32X add-on for the Sega Genesis. Both games featured box art by Marc Ericksen. Other releases were developed for non-Sega gaming systems such as the TurboGrafx-16 and the Famicom, while Europe and North America saw home computer ports by Elite Systems for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad, and the Commodore 64 among others. M2, in collaboration with Sega CS3, ported Space Harrier to the handheld Nintendo 3DS console in 2013, complete with stereoscopic 3D and widescreen graphics‚Äîa process that took eighteen months. Sega CS3 producer Yosuke Okunari described the game's 3D-conversion process as \\"almost impossible. When you take a character sprite that was originally in 2D and bring it into a 3D viewpoint, you have to build the graphic from scratch.\\" During development, M2 president Naoki Horii sought opinions from staff members regarding the gameplay of the arcade original. \\"They'd say it was hard to tell whether objects were right in front of their character or not. Once we had the game in 3D, the same people came back and said, 'OK, now I get it! I can play it now!'\\" The port included a feature that allowed players to use the 3DS's gyroscope to simulate the experience of the original motorised cabinet by way of a tilting screen, compounded by the optional activation of the sounds of button clicks and the cabinet's movement. Horii recalled in a 2015 interview that he was intrigued by the possibility of crafting Space Harrier and past Sega arcade games for the 3DS using stereoscopic technology. \\"Both SEGA and M2 wanted to see what would happen if we added a little bit of spice to these titles, in the form of modern gaming technology. Would it enhance the entertainment factor? I think the reception that the releases have had from critics highlights that these games are as relevant today as ever, and that means we've succeeded.\\" Reception Sega unveiled Space Harrier at the 1985 Amusement Machine Show in Japan, and it was positively received upon its initial arcade and home releases. In January 1986, Game Machine listed Space Harrier as being one of the most popular arcade games in Japan at the time. It tied at runner-up with the Commodore 64 title Uridium for Game of the Year honors at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards. Reviewing the game at the 1986 Amusement Trades Exhibition International in London, Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games hailed it as a \\"crowd stopper\\" due to its \\"realistic\\" moving cockpit, graphic capabilities, and \\"amazing technicolour landscapes\\", but cautioned: \\"Unless you are an expert, you will find it very difficult.\\" Ed Semrad of The Milwaukee Journal gave the Master System port a 9/10 rating, and Computer Gaming World deemed it \\"the best arcade shoot-'em-up of the year ... as exciting a game as this reviewer has ever played\\". Phil Campbell of The Sydney Morning Herald praised the 1989 Amiga conversion as \\"absorbing\\" and \\"a faithful copy of the original.\\" Computer and Video Games called the port \\"an entirely unpretentious computer game full of weird and wacky nasties.\\" Paul Mellerick of Sega Force wrote that the Game Gear version was \\"amazingly close to the original ... the scrolling's the speediest and smoothest ever seen.\\" GamePro commented that the 32X version had \\"straightforward controls\\", graphics relatively close to the arcade version, and was \\"a nice trip down memory lane\\", while Next Generation dubbed it \\"a decent, solid game\\". AllGame enthused: \\"No fan of the game who owns a 32X should be without it. It's one of the few must-haves on the system.\\" However, Lucas Thomas of IGN rated the 2008 Wii port a 4.5 score out of 10, citing its \\"poor visuals and poor control\\" and \\"dulled\\" color palette, and Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb, in his review of Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection, criticized the Space Harrier emulation's \\"numerous audio issues that make it sound completely different from the way the original game sounds.\\" Bob Mackey of USGamer said of the Nintendo 3DS port: \\"Space Harrier remains a shallow game built around dated visual pizazz, and that hasn't really changed. But you're not likely to find a more lavish and loving presentation than Space Harrier 3D.\\" The game continues to garner praise for its audio, visual, and gameplay features. GameSetWatch's Trevor Wilson remarked in 2006: \\"It's easy to see why the game is so well-loved to this day, with its blinding speed and classic tunes.\\" In 2008, Retro Gamer editor Darran Jones described the game as \\"difficult\\", but \\"a thing of beauty [that] even today ... possesses a striking elegance that urges you to return to it for just one more go.\\" That same year, IGN's Levi Buchanan opined: \\"Even today, Space Harrier is a sight to behold, a hellzapoppin' explosion of light, color, and imagination.\\" Eric Twice of Snackbar Games noted in 2013: \\"It's easy to just see it as just a game in which you press the button and things die, but Suzuki is a very conscious designer. He has a very specific vision behind each of his games, and nothing in them is ever left to chance.\\" In a 2013 Eurogamer retrospective on the series, Rich Stanton observed: \\"The speed at which Space Harrier moves has rarely been matched. It's not an easy thing to design a game around. Many other games have fast parts, or certain mechanics tied to speed‚Äîand it's interesting to note how many take control away at this point. Every time I play Space Harrier ... the speed blows me away one more time. It is a monster.\\" Eric Francisco of Inverse described the game's visuals in 2015: \\"Imagine an acid trip through an '80s anime, a Robert Jordan novel, and early Silicon Valley binge coding sessions.\\" GamesRadar ranked the arcade original's bonus stage among the \\"25 best bonus levels of all time\\" in 2014, likening it to players piloting The Neverending Story's dragon character Falkor. Kotaku named the Space Harrier tribute stage from Bayonetta in their 2013 selection of \\"the trippiest video game levels\\". Also in 2013, Hanuman Welch of Complex included Space Harrier among the ten Sega games he felt warranted a \\"modern reboot\\", citing its \\"kinetic pace that would be welcome on today's systems.\\" Hideki Kamiya, the director of PlatinumGames and creator of the Devil May Cry series, cited Space Harrier as an inspiration for his entering the video game industry in a 2014 interview. \\"There were so many trend-setting definitive games that came out [in the 1980s], like Gradius and Space Harrier. All these game creators were trying to make original, really creative games that had never existed before.\\" Legacy Space Harrier spawned two home-system sequels in 1988. The Master System exclusive Space Harrier 3-D utilized Sega's SegaScope 3-D glasses, and featured the same gameplay and visuals as the port of the original game while containing new stage, enemy, and boss designs. Space Harrier II was one of six launch titles for the Japanese debut of the Mega Drive (Sega Genesis), and released as such in the United States in August 1989. In December 2000, fifteen years after the original game's debut, Sega released the loose arcade sequel Planet Harriers, which again continued the gameplay style of the franchise but featured four new selectable characters each possessing distinct weapons, in addition to five fully realized stages and a new option of purchasing weapon power-ups. However, Planet Harriers had only a minimal presence in the United States due to its faltering arcade scene, and it was never given a home release. In 2003, a remake of the original Space Harrier was developed by M2 as part of the Japanese Sega Ages classic-game series (Sega Classics Collection in North America and Europe) for the PlayStation 2. The graphics are composed of polygons instead of sprites while several characters are redesigned, and a selectable option allows players to switch to a \\"fractal mode\\" that replaces the traditional checkerboard floors with texture-mapped playfields and includes two new underground stages. Power-ups such as bombs and lock-on targeting fly toward and are caught by the player during gameplay. The original Space Harrier was packaged with three of Yu Suzuki's other works‚ÄîAfter Burner, Out Run, and Super Hang-On‚Äîfor the 2003 Game Boy Advance release Sega Arcade Gallery. The Space Harrier Complete Collection (Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol. 20: Space Harrier II in Japan), developed by M2 for the PlayStation 2, followed on October 27, 2005 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the franchise, and was composed of all the official series releases \\"to go with the various generations of our customers,\\" according to Yosuke Okunari. Bonus content included a record-and-replay feature and an arcade promotional-material gallery, in addition to images of Hiroshi Kawaguchi's sheet music and notes for the original game's soundtrack. The 1991 Game Gear port is hidden therein as an Easter egg. Space Harrier was re- released for Nintendo Switch, as part of the Sega Ages lineup. =Other appearances= Space Harrier has shared an unofficial connection with another Sega shooter franchise, Fantasy Zone, which debuted in Japanese arcades in March 1986. Both series are believed to be set in the same universe; Space Harrier's opening line of dialogue at the start of gameplay (\\"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone\\") has been cited as a reason, but this was dispelled by Fantasy Zone director Yoji Ishii in a 2014 interview. A 1989 port of Fantasy Zone for the Japan-exclusive Sharp X68000 contains a hidden stage called \\"Dragon Land\\" that features Space Harrier enemy characters and is accessible only by following a specific set of instructions. In 1991, NEC Avenue developed Space Fantasy Zone for the CD-ROM, featuring Fantasy Zone's main character Opa-Opa navigating nine levels of combined gameplay elements and enemies from both franchises. Despite a December 1991 preview in Electronic Gaming Monthly and advertising designed by artist Satoshi Urushihara, Space Fantasy Zone was never released due to a legal dispute with Sega over NEC's unauthorized use of the Fantasy Zone property. However, bootleg copies were produced after a playable beta version of the game was released on the Internet. Opa-Opa is included in Planet Harriers as a hidden character, while one of three available endings in the 2007 PlayStation 2 release Fantasy Zone II DX has Harrier and Uriah attempting to eliminate a turned-evil Opa-Opa bent on destroying the game's eponymous Fantasy Zone. The arcade version of Space Harrier is included in the 1999 Dreamcast action-adventure title Shenmue as a minigame, and as a full port in the 2001 sequel Shenmue II. Sega Superstars Tennis and the 2010 action-adventure game Bayonetta feature Space Harrier- inspired minigames. The title is available as an unlockable game in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (2009), for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, though with sound emulation differences. In the 2012 title Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, a remixed version of the Space Harrier main theme plays during the \\"Race of Ages\\" stage, in which a holographic statue of Harrier and a flying dragon appear in the background. In addition, Shenmue character Ryo Hazuki pilots a flying Space Harrier sit-down arcade cabinet during airborne levels. Sega included an emulation of the original title as a minigame in several titles of their Yakuza series, such as the 2015 release Yakuza 0, and the 2018 releases Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise and Judgment. =Influenced games= The success of Space Harrier resulted in the development of other first-person rail shooters that attempted to emulate its three-dimensional scaling, visuals, and gameplay capabilities, causing them to be labeled \\"Space Harrier clones\\". The first and most notable example was the 1987 Square title The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner for the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System, which was followed by Pony Canyon's 1987 Famicom release Attack Animal Gakuen and other Japan-exclusive games such as Namco's Burning Force, Asmik's Cosmic Epsilon, and Wolf Team's Jimmu Densh≈ç, all released in 1989.

Dubbed the \\"Gettysburg of the West\\" by some authors (a term described as one that \\"serves the novelist better than the historian\\"),Edrington, p. 4 it was intended as the decisive blow by Confederate forces to break the Union possession of the West along the base of the Rocky Mountains. It was fought at Glorieta Pass in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in what is now New Mexico, and was an important event in the history of the New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War. There was a skirmish on March 26 between advance elements from each army, with the main battle occurring on March 28. Although the Confederates were able to push the Union force back through the pass, they had to retreat when their supply train was destroyed and most of their horses and mules killed or driven off. Eventually the Confederates had to withdraw entirely from the territory back into Confederate Arizona and then Texas. Glorieta Pass thus represented the climax of the campaign. New Mexico Campaign The lower portion of the New Mexico Territory had been largely neglected by both the federal government and the territorial government in Santa Fe. As a result, Confederate sympathy was strong, in hopes of receiving better treatment by the new government. Following secession moves by residents, Confederate forces seized Mesilla and captured the federal troops there, who made a halfhearted attempt to retreat to Santa Fe. In early 1862 the Confederacy established the Confederate Arizona Territory, which included the southern halves of both modern Arizona and New Mexico. The territorial capital was at Mesilla, some from El Paso and near today's major city of Las Cruces. The strategic goals were to gain access to the gold and silver mines of California and the Colorado Territory and the seaports in Southern California, and thus evade the Union naval blockade.Frazier, p. 75Whitlock, pp. 60‚Äì61 The commanders of the New Mexico Campaign were Confederate Brig. Gen. Henry Hopkins Sibley and Union Col. Edward Canby. Sibley attempted to capture Fort Craig, completely outmaneuvering Canby at the Battle of Valverde in February and driving him back into his fort, but failed to force Canby's surrender. Sibley then bypassed the fort and advanced north through the Rio Grande Valley, occupying Santa Fe on March 10. Canby remained at Fort Craig, hoping to cut Sibley's logistical support from Texas and awaiting reinforcements before he dared to take the offensive. Sibley made his headquarters at the abandoned Union storehouse at Albuquerque. In March Sibley sent a Confederate force of 200-300 Texans under the command of Maj. Charles L. Pyron on an advance expedition over the Glorieta Pass, a strategic location on the Santa Fe Trail at the southern tip of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains southeast of Santa Fe. Control of the pass would allow the Confederates to advance onto the High Plains and make an assault on Fort Union, a Union stronghold on the route northward over Raton Pass. Sibley sent six companies under the command of Col. Tom Green to block the eastern end of Glorieta Pass, turning any Union defensive position in the Sangre de Cristos.Frazier, p. 199 Opposing forces =Union (North)= =Confederate= Battle thumbupright=1.5Battle of Glorieta Pass: actions on March 28 The Confederates were led by Charles L. Pyron and William Read Scurry. During the battle on March 26, Pyron had his battalion of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles,This battalion also included companies of Arizona Confederates. four companies of the 5th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. John Shropshire and two cannons. Scurry's force included nine companies of the 4th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Henry Raguet, five companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles under Maj. Powhatan Jordan and three additional cannons. The Union forces were led by Col. John P. Slough of the 1st Colorado Infantry, with units under the command of Maj. John M. Chivington. In the action on March 26, Chivington had three infantry companies and one mounted company of the 1st Colorado and a detachment of the 1st and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments.Whitlock, p. 171 During the main battle on the 28th, Slough commanded, in person, nine companies of the 1st Colorado, a detachment from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd U.S. Cavalry regiments and two artillery batteries.Frazier, pp. 205, 215 Chivington commanded five companies of the 5th U.S. Infantry, one company from the 1st Colorado, James Hobart Ford's independent company from the 2nd Colorado and some New Mexico militiamen.Whitlock, p. 188 Prior to the battle Union forces performed a forced march from Denver, over Raton Pass, to Fort Union and then to Glorieta Pass, covering the distance of in 14 days. Combat commenced shortly after their arrival at the battlefield, leaving them little time to recuperate.Hudnall, p. 291 =Apache Canyon= Action at Apache Canyon. Pyron's force of 300 camped at Apache Canyon, at one end of Glorieta Pass, leaving a picket post of 50 men at the summit of the pass. Chivington led 418 soldiers to the pass and, on the morning of March 26, moved out to attack. After noon Chivington's men captured the picket post and found the main force behind them. Chivington advanced on them, but their artillery fire threw him back. He regrouped, split his force to the two sides of the pass, caught the Confederates in a crossfire, and soon forced them to retire. Pyron retired about to a narrow section of the pass and formed a defensive line before Chivington's men appeared. The Union forces flanked Pyron's men again and punished them with enfilade fire. Pyron ordered another retreat, but the withdrawal of the artillery caused the Confederates to become disorganized and start fighting in separate clusters of men. Chivington ordered a mounted Colorado company to make a frontal charge against the artillery; this succeeded in capturing several Confederates and scattering the rest. Not knowing if Confederate reinforcements were nearby, Chivington then retired and went into camp at Kozlowski's Ranch to await Slough with the main body. His small victory was a morale boost for Slough's army.Josephy, pp. 79‚Äì81.Frazier, pp. 208‚Äì210 No fighting occurred the next day, as reinforcements arrived for both sides. Scurry's troops arrived at 3:00 am on March 27, swelling the Confederate force to about 1,100 men and five cannons; as senior officer present, he took command of the entire Confederate force. Thinking that Slough would attack again and expecting Green to arrive in the Union rear at any time, Scurry chose to remain in place for the day, digging rifle pits.Frazier, pp. 211‚Äì212. Slough arrived early in the morning of March 28 with about 900 more men, bringing the Union strength to 1,300. =Glorieta Pass= Glorieta Pass battlefield. This photograph was taken in 1990 from Sharpshooter's Ridge, just north of Pigeon's Ranch. It was the location of the Union right flank during the last day's battle. Both Scurry and Slough decided to attack on March 28 and set out early to do so. Expecting the Confederates to remain in Apache Canyon, Slough sent Chivington with two infantry battalions, under Lewis and Wynkoop, out in a circling movement with orders to go hide out at Glorieta Pass and hit the Texans in the flank once Slough's main force had engaged their front.Frazier, p. 214 Chivington did as ordered and his men waited above the pass for Slough and the enemy to arrive. However, instead of remaining at Apache Canyon as Slough had expected, Scurry advanced down the canyon more rapidly than Slough had anticipated. Scurry believed the Union force was retreating to Fort Union. He intended to attack them until Green could arrive. One cannon and a small guard was left at Johnson's Ranch, while the rest of the Confederate force‚Äîmore than 1000 men‚Äîmarched eastwards along the Santa Fe Trail.Frazier, pp. 213‚Äì214. When Slough found the Texans so far forward he launched an attack, hitting them about 11:00 am some from Pigeon's Ranch. A provisional battalion of four companies from the 1st Colorado, supported by both batteries, was commanded by Lt. Col. Samuel Tappan, who deployed his men across the trail.Whitlock, p. 190 The Confederates dismounted and formed a line across the canyon, but the terrain caused some companies to become intermingled.Frazier, p. 216 Tappan was initially successful and held his ground for a half-hour, but the Confederates' numerical superiority enabled them to outflank Tappan's line by noon. The Union troops were thrown back in confusion but managed to take up position around the adobe ranch buildings. Slough reformed his men several hundred yards closer to Pigeon's Ranch, with the four companies under Tappan and an artillery battery on a hill to the left, the other battery supported by two companies in the center across the road and the remaining two companies on the ridge to the right.Whitlock, p. 200. Scurry then launched a three-pronged attack. Pyron and Raguet were ordered to attack the Union right, Shropshire the Union left, with the remainder led by Scurry against the Union center, and the artillery firing in support.Frazier, p. 219. The attack on the Union left was beaten back, with Shropshire killed. The attack on the center stalled, while the artillery was forced to withdraw after one cannon was disabled and a limber destroyed. The attack itself then stalled, with the Confederates fighting by squads \\"with a desperation unequaled by any engagement of the war.\\"Whitlock, p. 201 At around 3:00 pm the Confederates outflanked the Union right, but Raguet was mortally wounded. From the ridge (thereafter known as \\"Sharpshooters Ridge\\"), Confederate riflemen started picking off the artillerymen and infantry below them. Scurry again pressed the Union center, and the Union position became untenable. Slough reluctantly ordered a retreat, and Tappan formed the companies on the left into a rear guard. Slough reformed his line a half-mile east of Pigeon's Ranch, where skirmishing continued until dusk. The Union men finally retreated to Kozlowski's Ranch, leaving the Confederates in possession of the battlefield. Johnson's Ranch With the sounds of battle echoing in the distance, Lt. Col. Manuel Chaves of the 2nd New Mexico Infantry, commander of the New Mexican volunteers, informed Maj. Chivington that his scouts had located the Confederate supply train at Johnson's Ranch. After watching the supply train for an hour, Chivington's force descended the slope and attacked, driving off or capturing the small guard with few casualties on either side.Three Confederates were killed and several wounded, including the regimental chaplain; two officers and 15 men were captured. The only Union casualty was one man injured by flying debris from the exploding ammunition wagons. Whitlock pp. 206‚Äì207. They then looted and burned 80 supply wagons and spiked the cannon, either killing or driving off about 500 horses and mules before returning with their prisoners to Kozlowski's Ranch.Frazier, p. 226 With no supplies to sustain his advance, Scurry had to retreat to Santa Fe, the first step on the long road back to San Antonio, Texas. Thanks to Chaves' assistance, the Federals had turned a defeat into victory and stopped further Confederate advances in the Southwest. Glorieta Pass was the turning point of the war in the New Mexico Territory. Parts of the battlefield are preserved in Pecos National Historical Park. Controversy Many New Mexicans disputed the view that Chivington was the hero of Johnson's Ranch. Many Santa Fe residents credited James L. Collins, a Bureau of Indian Affairs official, who had suggested the roundabout attack on the supply train.William Wallace Mills,W.W. Mills (1901) Forty Years at El Paso (1858-1898) \\"Of the thirty-five hundred Texans who entered New Mexico only about eleven hundred returned to Texas. The others were dead, wounded, sick, prisoners or deserters. Many were buried on the west side of El Paso street, near where the Opera House now stands.\\" Chivington had actually been sent out in hopes of making a flank attack, and the discovery of the supply train was a lucky accident. He was also accused of almost letting the opportunity slip by him. On January 23, 1864, the New Mexico Territorial Legislature adopted a resolution that did not mention Chivington and instead asked President Lincoln to promote William H. Lewis and Asa B. Carey, both regular army officers, for \\"distinguished service\\" in the battle. On March 8 the Rio Abajo Press of Albuquerque complained about \\"Col. Chivington's strutting about in plumage stolen from Captain William H. Lewis\\" (it did not mention Carey). According to the newspaper editor, \\"Some one of the party\\" suggested the attack, which Chivington only agreed to after \\"two hours persuasion.\\" Furthermore, Lewis had led the attack, while Chivington was \\"viewing the scene from afar\\".Keleher, pp. 180‚Äì182. A more serious charge made against Chivington was that if he had hurried to reinforce Slough as soon as he heard gunfire coming from Pigeon's Ranch, his 400 men might have been enough to win the battle for the Federals, especially if he had attacked Scurry's flank as he had been ordered.One reason Chivington failed to come was due to an acoustic shadow that prevented him from hearing sounds from the battle. Whitlock, p. 205. Aftermath Battle of Glorieta Pass marker at the Cuerno Verde Rest Area, Colorado. In the end, the Battle of Glorieta Pass was consequential. First, despite the fact that the Confederates took the field, they were forced to retreat to Santa Fe due to the destruction of their supplies and eventually abandon New Mexico Territory.Frazier, p. 230. Second, the battle at Glorieta foiled Sibley's plan to obtain his key objective: the capture of the major federal base at Fort Union. That would have broken federal resistance in New Mexico and compelled Union forces to retire north of Raton Pass and back into Colorado Territory.Josephy, pp. 91‚Äì92. In any case, the dream of a Confederate stronghold in the Southwest was impractical; New Mexico could not provide enough sustenance for any prolonged Confederate occupation.Whitlock, pp. 240‚Äì241 Furthermore, the approach of the Federal \\"California Column\\" eastward through the New Mexico Territory during the summer of 1862 would have seriously jeopardized Confederate control of the region. Battlefield preservation The battlefield in 2012. In 1987 two Confederate burial sites were discovered at Pigeon's Ranch. One was the solitary grave of Maj. John Samuel Shropshire, the other was a mass grave of 30 Confederates. Only Shropshire and five others could be positively identified. On August 5, 1990, Maj. Shropshire's remains were reburied next to his parents in his family's cemetery in Bourbon County, Kentucky. The remaining 30 Confederates were reinterred in the Santa Fe National Cemetery.Los Angeles Times In 1993 the congressionally appointed Civil War Sites Advisory Commission issued its \\"Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields.\\" The commission was tasked with identifying the nation's historically significant Civil War sites, determining their importance and providing recommendations for their preservation to Congress. Of the roughly 10,500 actions of the U.S. Civil War,Dyer. 384 (3.7%) were identified by the commission as principal battles and rated according to their significance and threat of loss. The Battle of Glorieta Pass received the highest rating from the commission, priority I (class A). Class A battlefields are principal strategic operations having a direct impact on the course of the war. With this rating the commission placed Glorieta Pass on the same level as battles such as Gettysburg and Antietam. The priority I rating identified Glorieta Pass as being not only one of the most important, but also one of the most highly endangered battlefields in the country. Only ten other battlefields received the priority I (class A) rating. The commission recommended that Congress focus its preservation efforts on priority I, nationally significant battlefields.Civil War Sites Advisory Commission Report on the Nation's Civil War Battlefields. Washington, DC: The National Park Service, 1993. Since 1993 portions of the Glorieta Pass Battlefield have become a unit of the National Park Service. The Glorieta Pass unit (Pigeon's Ranch) comprises roughly 20% of the total battlefield. The remaining 80% is in private ownership. Glorieta Pass Battlefield is managed by Pecos National Historical Park and supported by the Glorieta Battlefield Coalition, a non-profit citizens' organization. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the Glorieta Pass battlefield. American Battlefield Trust \\"Saved Land\\" webpage.

Biography Juan Prim, Spanish general and statesman. Painting by Antonio Mar√≠a Esquivel Prim was the son of lieutenant colonel Pablo Prim. He entered the free corps known as the volunteers of Isabella II in 1834, and in the course of the First Carlist War he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and had two orders of knighthood conferred upon him. After the pacification of 1839, as a progressist opposed to the dictatorship of General Espartero, he was sent into exile. However, in 1843 he was elected deputy for Tarragona, and after defeating Espartero at Bruch he entered Madrid in triumph with General Serrano. The regent Maria Christina promoted him major-general, and made him conde de Reus (Count of Reus) and vizconde del Bruch (Viscount of Bruch). General Narv√°ez, the prime minister, failed to understand what constitutional freedom meant, and General Prim, on showing signs of opposition, was sentenced to six years' imprisonment in the Philippine Islands. The sentence was not carried out, and Prim remained an exile in England and France until the amnesty of 1847. He then returned to Spain, and was first employed as captain-general of Puerto Rico (Governor of Puerto Rico) and afterwards as military representative with the sultan during the Crimean War. In 1854 he was elected to the cortes, and gave his support to General O'Donnell, who promoted him lieutenant-general in 1856. In the war with Morocco he did such good service at Castillejos (Fnideq), Cabo Negro, Guad al Gelu and Campamento in 1860 that he was made marqu√©s de los Castillejos (Marquess of los Castillejos) and Grande de Espa√±a (Grandee of Spain). Prim commanded the Spanish expeditionary army in Mexico in 1862, when Spain, Great Britain, and France sought forced payment from the liberal government of Benito Ju√°rez for loans. Prim was a sympathizer with the Mexican liberal cause, thus he refused to consent to the ambitious schemes of French emperor Napoleon III, and withdrew Spanish forces following a meeting with Manuel Doblado.Brian Hamnett, Ju√°rez, New York: Longmans 1994, pp. 169, 278. On Prim's return to Spain he joined the opposition, heading pronunciamentos in Catalonia against generals Narv√°ez and O'Donnell. All his attempts failed until the death of Narv√°ez in April 1868, after which Queen Isabella became increasingly tyrannical, until at last even Serrano was exiled. In September 1868 General Serrano and General Prim returned, and Brigadier Topete, commanding the fleet, raised the standard of revolt at C√°diz. In July 1869 General Serrano was elected regent, and Prim became president of the council and was made a marshal. On 6 November 1870 Amadeo, Duke of Aosta, was elected king of Spain, but General Prim, on leaving the chamber of the Cortes on 28 December, was shot by unknown assassins and died two days later. The Cortes took his children as wards of the country; three days afterwards King Amadeo I swore in the presence of the corpse to observe the new Spanish constitution. This is due to the fact that Prim had searched all the European courts of the time trying to find a monarch who was not opposed to being democratically elected. He is quoted for saying that \\"looking for a democratic monarch in Europe is like trying to find an atheist in heaven\\". After France had rejected the almost elected Leopold of Hohenzollern because of their fear that Prussia might thereby become more powerful, Amadeo of Savoy was the most fitting who consented. The workshop of metalworker Pl√°cido Zuloaga was commissioned to make a monumental sarcophagus for Prim. Completed in 1875 in Eibar, this now resides in the cemetery at Reus.

Although these anabolic reactions occur throughout the body, most SAM-e is produced and consumed in the liver. More than 40 methyl transfers from SAM-e are known, to various substrates such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and secondary metabolites. It is made from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. SAM-e was first discovered by Giulio Cantoni in 1952. In bacteria, SAM-e is bound by the SAM riboswitch, which regulates genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis. In eukaryotic cells, SAM-e serves as a regulator of a variety of processes including DNA, tRNA, and rRNA methylation; immune response; amino acid metabolism; transsulfuration; and more. In plants, SAM-e is crucial to the biosynthesis of ethylene, an important plant hormone and signaling molecule. Chemically, it is a sulfonium betaine which serves as a source of electrophilic methyl group or as a source of 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical.  Biochemistry  = SAM-e cycle = The SN2-like methyl transfer reaction. Only the SAM cofactor and cytosine base are shown for simplicity. The reactions that produce, consume, and regenerate SAM-e are called the SAM-e cycle. In the first step of this cycle, the SAM-dependent methylases (EC 2.1.1) that use SAM-e as a substrate produce S-adenosyl homocysteine as a product. S-Adenosyl homocysteine is a strong negative regulator of nearly all SAM-dependent methylases despite their biological diversity. This is hydrolysed to homocysteine and adenosine by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase EC 3.3.1.1 and the homocysteine recycled back to methionine through transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, by one of the two classes of methionine synthases (i.e. cobalamin-dependent (EC 2.1.1.13) or cobalamin- independent (EC 2.1.1.14)). This methionine can then be converted back to SAM-e, completing the cycle. In the rate-limiting step of the SAM cycle, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) irreversibly reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. = Radical SAM-e enzymes = A large number of iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes cleave SAM-e reductively to produce a 5‚Ä≤-deoxyadenosyl 5‚Ä≤-radical as an intermediate, and are called radical SAM enzymes. Most enzymes with this capability share a region of sequence homology that includes the motif CxxxCxxC or a close variant. The radical intermediate allows enzymes to perform a wide variety of unusual chemical reactions. Examples of radical SAM enzymes include spore photoproduct lyase, activases of pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic sulfatases, lysine 2,3-aminomutase, and various enzymes of cofactor biosynthesis, peptide modification, metalloprotein cluster formation, tRNA modification, lipid metabolism, etc. Some radical SAM-e enzymes use a second SAM-e as a methyl donor. Radical SAM enzymes are much more abundant in anaerobic bacteria than in aerobic organisms. They can be found in all domains of life and are largely unexplored. A recent bioinformatics study concluded that this family of enzymes includes at least 114,000 sequences including 65 unique reactions. = Polyamine biosynthesis = Another major role of SAM-e is in polyamine biosynthesis. Here, SAM-e is decarboxylated by adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50) to form S-adenosylmethioninamine. This compound then donates its n-propylamine group in the biosynthesis of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine from putrescine. SAM-e is required for cellular growth and repair. It is also involved in the biosynthesis of several hormones and neurotransmitters that affect mood, such as epinephrine. Methyltransferases are also responsible for the addition of methyl groups to the 2‚Ä≤ hydroxyls of the first and second nucleotides next to the 5‚Ä≤ cap in messenger RNA.  Therapeutic uses  As of 2012 the evidence was inconclusive as to whether SAM can mitigate the pain of osteoarthritis; clinical trials that had been conducted were too small from which to generalize. A 2016 study concluded that for major depressive disorder, \\"Given the absence of high quality evidence and the inability to draw firm conclusions based on that evidence, the use of SAMe for the treatment of depression in adults should be investigated further.\\" The SAM-e cycle has been closely tied to the liver since 1947 because people with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver would accumulate large amounts of methionine in their blood. While multiple lines of evidence from laboratory tests on cells and animal models suggest that SAM might be useful to treat various liver diseases, as of 2012 SAM had not been studied in any large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that would allow an assessment of its efficacy and safety. = Pharmacokinetics = Oral SAM achieves peak plasma concentrations three to five hours after ingestion of an enteric-coated tablet (400‚Äì1000 mg). The half-life is about 100 minutes. =Adverse effects= Gastrointestinal disorder, dyspepsia and anxiety can occur with SAM consumption. Long-term effects are unknown. SAM is a weak DNA-alkylating agent. Another reported side effect of SAM is insomnia; therefore, the supplement is often taken in the morning. Other reports of mild side effects include lack of appetite, constipation, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, and anxiety/nervousness, but in placebo-controlled studies, these side effects occur at about the same incidence in the placebo groups. SAM-e has recently been shown to play a role in epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation is a key regulator in epigenetic modification during mammalian cell development and differentiation. In mouse models, excess levels of SAM-e have been implicated in erroneous methylation patterns associated with diabetic neuropathy. SAM-e serves as the methyl donor in cytosine methylation, which is a key epigenetic regulatory process. Because of this impact on epigenetic regulation, SAM-e has been tested as an anti-cancer treatment. Cancer cell proliferation is dependent on having low levels of DNA methylation. In vitro addition has been shown to remethylate promoter sequences and decrease the production of proto- oncogenes. Deficiencies in radical SAM-e enzymes have been associated with a variety of diseases including congenital heart disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and increased viral susceptibility. =Interactions and contraindications= Taking SAM at the same time as some drugs may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially dangerous condition caused by having too much serotonin. These drugs include dextromethorphan (Robitussin), meperidine (Demerol), pentazocine (Talwin), and tramadol (Ultram). SAM may also interact with antidepressant medications increasing the potential for their side effects and reduce the effectiveness of levodopa for Parkinson's disease. People who have bipolar disorder should not use SAM because it increases the risk of manic episodes. =Availability in different countries= In the United States and Canada, SAM is sold as a dietary supplement under the marketing name SAM-e (also spelled SAME or SAMe; pronounced \\"Sammy\\" Woolston, Chris. \\"What is SAM-e?\\" 1 January 2019. Retrieved on 14 November 2019.; it was introduced in the US in 1999, after the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was passed in 1994. It was introduced as a prescription drug in Italy in 1979, in Spain in 1985, and in Germany in 1989; as of 2012, it was marketed as a prescription drug in Russia, India, China, Italy, Germany, Vietnam, and Mexico.

It is a common, near- endemic species in Namibia, with a total population estimated at 340,000 individuals. Description It is a medium-sized bird, in length, characterized by a white belly, black back, with white spots on the wings and white secondary flight feathers. The outer feathers of the long tail are also white. Females are smaller than males and can be recognized by turquoise facial skin. The eyes are black and the beak is red. Range and habitat Its habitat is the savannah and dry thornveldt of northwestern Namibia and southwestern Angola. Habits Unlike other hornbills, which are omnivorous, the Monteiro's hornbill feeds exclusively on insects and other small arthropods. In springtime, Monteiro's hornbills migrate to the southern Windhoek region to nest. They are adapted to the arid environment, and drinking is not a vital necessity for them. They breed at the end of a good rainy season, laying 3 to 5 greyish-white eggs, which hatch after about 45 days. The nest is built on rock faces or in trees.

The main premise revolves around the conflict between He-Man (the alter ego of Prince Adam) against Skeletor on the planet Eternia, with a vast lineup of supporting characters in a hybrid setting of medieval sword and sorcery and sci-fi technology. A follow-up series, She-Ra: Princess of Power revolves around He-Man's sister She-Ra and her rebellion against The Horde on the planet Etheria. Since its initial launch, the franchise has spawned a variety of products, including multiple lines of action figures, five animated television series, several comic series, video games, books and magazines, a daily newspaper comic strip, and two feature films (one animated, one live action). Series overview and main characters He-Man and the accompanying Masters of the Universe franchise would make their debut in 1982 with Mattel's release of the original \\"Masters of the Universe\\" 5.5-inch action-figure toy line. Masters of the Universe, often abbreviated as MOTU, would begin its mythos through the minicomics that accompanied the toys throughout the 1980s. These initial mini comics were soon followed by several children's books and issues of DC Comics. However, the Masters of the Universe franchise would become best known through Filmation's groundbreaking He-Man and the Masters of the Universe animated series. Debuting in the fall of 1983, the Filmation series ran 130 episodes over two seasons until November 1985. Since its inception, Masters of the Universe has usually placed its focus on the two primary characters, the blonde muscular He-Man, \\"the most powerful man in the Universe,\\" and his nemesis, the evil skull-faced, blue-skinned sorcerer Skeletor and their many moral-themed encounters on the planet Eternia. Set in a hybrid world of sword and sorcery and technological sci-fi, He-Man battles with Skeletor to prevent him from conquering Eternia and discovering the secrets of Castle Grayskull‚Äîa mysterious ancient fortress with a skull-shaped facade, containing great power and magic. As with many toy franchises that have been transferred to several different media, there are a number of story differences between the various versions of Masters of the Universe. In most continuities from the Filmation series onward, He-Man is the secret identity of Prince Adam, the son of King Randor and Queen Marlena, the ruling royal family of Eternia. Adam becomes He- Man by holding aloft his magic Power Sword and uttering the words \\"By the power of Grayskull‚Ä¶\\" and serves as the protector of good on Eternia. He is first given this ability by the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull, a powerful magic user and mystic guardian of the castle, who in many depictions is able to transform herself into the falcon Zoar. Upon Adam's transformation into He- Man, his cowardly green pet tiger Cringer becomes the mighty Battle Cat, a giant armored beast that He-Man often rides into battle. He-Man's most prominent allies include Man-At-Arms, a wise loyal veteran soldier and inventor; and his adopted daughter Teela, a spirited and skillful female warrior, often portrayed as captain of the Eternian Royal Guard and a potential love interest of He-Man/Prince Adam. The childlike Trollan magician Orko also often features as one of He-Man's closest allies; as does Stratos, a flying bird-man from the kingdom of Avion; Ram-Man, a stout dimwitted warrior with springlike legs and a large helmet that encloses his head and upper torso; and Man-E-Faces, an actor with face-changing abilities. Skeletor is originally described as an evil being from another dimension and in some later MOTU lore as a disfigured and vengeful relative of the royal family, known as Keldor. From his lair on Snake Mountain, Skeletor would assemble his \\"Evil Warriors\\" to assist in his various schemes to conquer Eternia. These core minions usually include Beast Man, an orange-furred, apelike master of beasts; Mer-Man, an aquatic fishlike ocean warlord; Evil-Lyn, a powerful sorceress and one of Skeletor's most feared and competent associates; Trap Jaw, an iron- jawed criminal with a mechanical arm that can be fitted by a various assortment of weapons; and Tri-Klops, a mercenary swordsman with a rotating three-eyed visor. The series overall would feature a wide and ever-expanding cast of heroic and villainous characters added to the toy line, the Filmation cartoon, and other media; with the franchise far outshining prior expectations, continuing to grow through 1983 and 1984. The release of the animated cartoon movie He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword in the spring of 1985 introduced He-Man's twin sister She-Ra (with her secret alter ego Princess Adora) and the arch-villain Hordak (leader of the Evil Horde and the former master of Skeletor) on the planet Etheria. Stemming from the animated movie, Filmation went on to produce 93 episodes of the series She-Ra: Princess of Power, which ran until the end of 1986, along with the He-Man & She-Ra: Christmas Special. Other main characters of the She-Ra series would include Swift Wind, winged unicorn and alter ego of She-Ra's trusty steed Spirit;, Light Hope, mystical living beam of light and mentor to She-Ra; and her Great Rebellion allies Glimmer, magically inclined onetime leader of the rebellion; Bow, skilled archer and the main male protagonist of the series; Kowl, Bow's owllike, rainbow-eared companion; Madame Razz, absent-minded witch with her sarcastic sentient Broom; and Queen Angella, Glimmer's mother and angel-winged queen of the Bright Moon; along with Hordak's spell-casting witch Shadow Weaver; shape-shifting spy Imp; bumbling bug-eyed henchman Mantenna; Force Squad captain Catra; evil scientist Modulok; beastly warrior Grizzlor; energy-draining Leech; and thuggish henchwoman Scorpia. Various children's books, magazines, comics, read-along records/cassette tapes, and other merchandise were also released worldwide around this time, with much of the content based primarily on the Filmation He-Man and She-Ra series. The live- action film Masters of the Universe was released in 1987 by Cannon Films, starring Dolph Lundgren and Frank Langella. The later 1980s mini comics, Marvel comics series, and UK magazine comics continued the adventures of He- Man and She-Ra past the end of the two Filmation series. However, popularity had waned by the end of 1987 and a planned continuation of the original toy line under the heading of \\"The Powers of Grayskull\\" (set in ancient Eternia, featuring the villain King Hiss and He-Man's ancestor He-Ro) was started, but eventually scrapped. He-Man would be brought back in 1989 in an entirely new and space-based cartoon series and toy line known as \\"The New Adventures of He-Man.\\" Only He-Man and Skeletor would return as major characters to join the battle between Galactic Guardians and Space Mutants on the planet Primus. Jetlag Productions would go on to produce 65 episodes of the New Adventures cartoon, with a few mini comics and adventure magazines also created for this new series. Ultimately, though, the series would not be as successful and the entire franchise would go on a hiatus for more than a decade. After some success with a \\"Commemorative Series\\" rerelease of the classic action figures in 2000, Mattel relaunched the toy line with all-new action figures, playsets, and vehicles, sculpted by Four Horsemen Studios in 2002. As part of the relaunch, a modern updated animated series was also created by Mike Young Productions, lasting for 39 episodes; featuring He-Man and his ensemble of heroic warriors, now called the \\"Masters of the Universe,\\" battling Skeletor's minions and, later, King Hiss, the ancient and evil lord of the Snake Men. Characters such as Mekaneck, heroic warrior with a mechanical extending neck; Buzz-Off, heroic beelike flying Andreenid warrior; Clawful, large villainous crab-like henchman; Whiplash, evil reptilian Caligar with a deadly tail; Stinkor, foul-smelling mutated Paleezean; and many others would gain more prominent backstories during this series. Several volumes of comic books were also produced to go along with the series by Image Comics and MVCreations. Although popular with longtime fans and collectors (with mini-statue figures being released by NECA until 2007), the new series failed to catch on with a larger audience and was canceled in 2004. From 2007 to the present, a new assortment of Masters of the Universe action figures has been released under the banner of \\"Masters of the Universe Classics.\\" Primarily geared toward the collector's market, the series took into consideration all aspects of previous Masters of the Universe lore, with characters from all previous incarnations (and also featured a continuation of the original mini comics line). DC Comics would soon follow suit and relaunch a new grittier, contemporary version of the Masters of the Universe franchise, releasing various new comic book series from 2012 until present; featuring crossovers with the DC Comics Universe, ThunderCats, and a new origin for She-Ra, culminating in Hordak's conquest of Eternia. The most recent DC comic book series is a crossover with the DC Injustice franchise. Netflix and DreamWorks released a new animated series entitled She-Ra and the Princesses of Power in November 2018. A new Masters of the Universe‚Äìbased film has long been in development and is currently slated for release in 2021. History and versions of the franchise =Origin of the franchise= Mattel began development of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe in the late 1970s with Conan the Barbarian‚Äìinspired concepts from Roger Sweet, Mark Taylor, Donald F. Glut, and several other contributors. The catalyst for the creation of He-Man began in 1976, when Mattel's CEO Ray Wagner declined a request to produce a toy line of action figures based on the characters from the George Lucas film Star Wars, with the film's toy rights being acquired by Kenner instead.The rights to manufacture the Star Wars toyline were later acquired by Hasbro. Upon the commercial success of the film trilogy and all related merchandise during the next few years, Mattel attempted to launch several unsuccessful toy lines, none of which captured the public's imagination or made a significant dent in the toy market.These included: Kid Gallant, a medieval knight; Robin and the Space Hoods, a sci-fi figure; and the daredevil Kenny Dewitt, pronounced \\"Can He Do It?\\" In the race to design the next hit action figure, Roger Sweet, a lead designer working for Mattel's Preliminary Design Department throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, according to his book Mastering the Universe: He-Man and the Rise and Fall of a Billion-Dollar Idea, was the first to conceptualize the idea of He-Man. However, this is not officially acknowledged by Mattel, and authorship of the He-Man character has been subject to debate.The general consensus among the fandom is that it was the collaborative efforts of many designers and artists (including Mark Taylor, Roger Sweet, Anthony G. Guerrero, Ted Mayer, Tom Kalinske, and others) that inspired and produced the original MOTU toys. According to various former Mattel designers, Roger Sweet drew inspiration for the designs of his first He-Man prototypes from fantasy drawings of Mattel packaging designer Mark Taylor, which included a drawing of a He-Man-like character called Torak. Roger Sweet presented the He-Man concept to Ray Wagner at the Mattel Product Conference, in the form of three large three-dimensional plaster prototype models, which Sweet dubbed the \\"He-Man Trio.\\" These prototypes were molded from extensively modified Big Jim action figures (Battle Cat would also be adapted from a tiger in the Big Jim toy line). The He-Man Trio models were an axe-wielding barbarian, a tank-headed soldier, and a spaceman with a Boba Fett‚Äìlike helmet. Out of the three concepts, the barbarian version of He-Man was chosen to be the basis of the toy line (this original trio-prototype idea was released around 30 years later as the figure Vykron, and the barbarian concept on its own as Vikor, in the \\"Masters of the Universe Classics\\" line). > \\"The only way I was going to have a chance to sell this [to Wagner] was to > make three 3D models‚Äîbig ones. I glued a Big Jim figure [from another Mattel > toy line] into a battle action pose and I added a lot of clay to his body. I > then had plaster casts made. These three prototypes, which I presented in > late 1980, brought He-Man into existence. I simply explained that this was a > powerful figure that could be taken anywhere and dropped into any context > because he had a generic name: He-Man!\\"Other names considered by the design > team were Mighty Man, Megaton Man, Strong Man and Big Man. ‚ÄîRoger Sweet Originally set under the working title \\"Lords of Power,\\" the name \\"Masters of the Universe\\" came into being when it was suggested that the former name of the toy line was too religious in nature. The roster of characters would soon expand past the main hero, He-Man, and Mark Taylor would draw inspiration for the series main villain, Skeletor, from his 1971 sketch entitled The King of Styx, along with early renderings of his characters Demo-Man and D-Man. Taylor would create preliminary designs for several other original characters as well, with additional ideas or direction from Mark Ellis and Paul Cleveland, among others, but the premise behind the toy line had not yet been fully established. The backstory of He-Man was first conceptualized for special mini-comic books that Mattel marketing director Mark Ellis promised distributors would accompany the toys. Mattel had DC Comics mock up a comic book, with the earliest storybooks written by Donald F. Glut. With major distributor Toys \\"R\\" Us concerned that \\"five-year-olds don't read\\", Mark Ellis then first proposed the idea of an animated TV special. This would eventually lead to a meeting with Filmation head Lou Scheimer and the creation of the He- Man and the Masters of the Universe animated series. Earlier in 1980, the rights-holders of Conan the Barbarian had been negotiating the character's toy rights with Mattel and they entered into an agreement the following year regarding characters from the 1982 Conan movie. However, with Mattel introducing the Masters of the Universe toy line in 1982, the rights-holders sued Mattel claiming the character was an infringement on the character of Conan. Mattel eventually won the lawsuit and after legal agreements were dissolved, it was stated that the toy line was never intended for the Conan film.Movie Legends: Was He-Man Originally a Toy Tie-In for the Conan Film?, Comic Book Resources However, some Conan influence can be seen, as Roger Sweet has claimed to have drawn some inspiration from the paintings of Frank Frazetta, a fantasy artist with many works depicting Conan the Barbarian, when creating He-Man. =Early action figures and comics= Original action figures and mini comics (1981‚Äì1982) The \\"Masters of the Universe\\" toy line was created by Mattel in 1981, and first released to stores in 1982 as 5¬Ω-inch action figures (as opposed to the 3¬æ-inch size used by Kenner's Star Wars and Hasbro's G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero lines). The two main characters, He- Man (\\"the most powerful man in the universe\\") and his arch-enemy Skeletor (\\"evil lord of destruction\\") were the first released in action figure form, along with other core characters of the series: Man-At-Arms (\\"heroic master of weapons\\"), Beast Man (\\"Skeletor's savage henchman\\"), and Battle Cat (\\"He-Man's fighting tiger\\"). Later on that year, the first wave of action figures in 1982 would also include Teela (\\"heroic warrior goddess\\"), Mer-Man (\\"evil ocean warlord\\"), Stratos (\\"heroic winged warrior\\"), and Zodac (\\"the cosmic enforcer\\"). The Teela action figure was originally proposed as representing both the Sorceress character (when wearing the figure's \\"snake armor\\") and the Teela character (when without the \\"snake armor\\"), as Mattel believed there would not be enough demand for two female action figures in the initial wave. Alongside the first wave of figures were the Battle Ram (\\"mobile launcher\\") and Wind Raider (\\"assault lander\\") vehicles and the playset Castle Grayskull (\\"fortress of power and mystery\\"). These first figures as well as Castle Grayskull were primarily designed by Mark Taylor, although the final production sculpt of the original He-Man action figure was completed by Tony Guerrero and the first vehicles were designed by Ted Mayer. Brief descriptions of the characters would appear on the packaging and box art (with illustrations by Errol McCarthy, Rudy Obrero, William Garland, William George, and others). However, the lore of Masters of the Universe would be first fully explored through the mini-comics that accompanied the action figures throughout the duration of the line (with 49 distinct comics being issued from 1981 until 1987). The original four mini comics, He-Man and the Power Sword, The King of Castle Grayskull, Battle in the Clouds, and The Vengeance of Skeletor were made by Mattel in 1981 and written by Donald F. Glut, with artwork by Alfredo Alcala. He-Man is introduced in the first mini comic, He- man and the Power Sword, as a wandering barbarian, leaving behind his jungle tribe on Eternia. The world of Eternia is initially depicted as dealing with the aftermath of a great war that has devastated once-powerful civilizations, leaving behind their fantastical machinery and weapons. The events of the war have also opened a rift between dimensions, which has allowed the evil warlord Skeletor to travel into Eternia. This inaugural incarnation of Skeletor sets his sights on obtaining both halves of the Power Sword (originally split in two in these early stories), in order to gain entry into the ancient Castle Grayskull (depicted, in these early comics, as being inhabited by the ghostly \\"Spirit of Castle Grayskull\\"). The main premise being that whomever attains control of Castle Grayskull will gain the power to become Master of the Universe. To combat Skeletor, He-Man is given special powers, armor, and weapons by the Sorceress (she has green skin in her debut appearance and is wearing the \\"snake armor\\" that came with the original Teela action figure, instead of adorning her more familiar birdlike attire, as seen in the Filmation series). He-Man (not yet with the dual identity of Prince Adam) is supported in these initial stories by his heroic allies: Battle Cat (without the dual form of Cringer), Man-At-Arms, Teela, and Stratos, the winged warrior (who erroneously came fighting on the side of Skeletor in the initial mini- comic). Skeletor, in turn, enlists the help of the brutish apelike Beast Man and fishlike Mer-Man to battle He-Man or his heroic warriors. Second wave of action figures and mini comics (1983) Other major characters introduced the following year in these early waves of action figures included He-Man's allies Ram Man (\\"heroic human battering ram\\"; with spring-loaded legs), Man-E- Faces (\\"heroic human‚Ä¶robot‚Ä¶monster\\"; with three alternate faces), and Zoar (\\"the fighting falcon\\"; whose sculpt was taken from the Big Jim toy line's \\"Eagle of Danger Peak\\"); along with Skeletor's evil warriors Tri-Klops (described on his packaging as \\"evil and sees everything\\"; with a three-eyed rotating visor), Trap Jaw (\\"evil and armed for combat\\"; with alternate weapons to place in his arm socket), Panthor (Skeletor's \\"savage cat\\"; a fuzzy purple adaptation of Battle Cat's toy mold), Screeech (Skeletor's \\"barbarian bird\\"; a purple recast of the orange Zoar), Faker (\\"evil robot of Skeletor\\"; a blue- skinned clone of He-Man, seldom featured in MOTU media, without an introductory mini-comic during his initial release), and Evil-Lyn (\\"evil warrior goddess\\"; the last figure released in this wave, she would not yet feature in any MOTU media until her prominent role in the Filmation animated series). The Attak-Trak vehicle and the Point Dread & Talon Fighter playset were also released in the 1983 line. This second series, consisting of seven new mini-comics and released in 1982‚Äì83, was produced by DC Comics, written by Gary Cohn and featured artwork by Mark Texeira. These mini-comics would devote several issues toward introducing the new action figure characters into the line. He-Man's new ally Ram Man is initially tricked into fighting on the side of Skeletor in He-Man Meets Ram-Man. Man-E-Faces is introduced in The Ordeal of Man-E-faces as an Eternian actor turned into a monster by Skeletor, freed by the Sorceress, only to be magically possessed by three multiple personalities: man, monster, and robot. Skeletor's evil warriors also get their own introductory mini comics, with Tri-Klops as a skilled swordsman/mercenary in The Terror of Tri-Klops and Trap Jaw portrayed in The Menace of Trap Jaw as a criminal from another dimension. In these pre- Filmation stories, the primary characters of Prince Adam, Cringer, Orko, and Evil-Lyn did not yet feature in the series; although the Eternian Palace and Royal Court with King Randor and Queen Marlena (both yet unnamed, looking decidedly older than in the later series) are featured in several of these DC mini-comics, as are the mystical falcon Zoar (not yet an alternate form of the Sorceress) and the Attak-Trak (battle machine, based on the toy, and not yet a robotic-voiced van-like vehicle, as in the Filmation cartoon). The storyline concept of Teela as the secret daughter of the Sorceress (albeit as a clone) and adopted daughter of Man-At-Arms was first introduced at this time as well in the mini comic The Tale of Teela. A special comic and record entitled The Power of Point Dread/Danger at Castle Grayskull was also produced for the Talon Fighter and Point Dread playset. Additional waves of action figures, creatures, vehicles, and playsets were released every year until 1987, totaling 70 distinct figures in all (including 24 creatures, 12 vehicles, six playsets, and 10 accessories) with the final overseas releases from the original line coming from Italy in 1988. A major proponent of the 1980s action-figure boom, Masters of the Universe figures proved to be very popular and were produced and marketed all over the world. Most of action figures were made in Taiwan and Malaysia. However, Mattel also had production facilities in the United States, Mexico, France, Spain, and joint ventures with Leo Toys of India, Top Toys of Argentina, Estrela of Brazil, Rotoplast of Venezuela and Takara of Japan. DC Comics ‚Äì 1980s series (1982‚Äì83) In July 1982, He- Man and the Masters of the Universe would appear for the first time in the pages of DC Comics with DC Comics Presents Issue #47, in the story From Eternia With Death, followed by a special insert comic in many DC's titles from November 1982, entitled Fate is the Killer.DC Comics Presents #47: \\"From Eternia With Death\\" (1982)The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl #1: \\"Fate Is The Killer\\" (November 1982) In these first two DC MOTU stories, Superman ends up on Eternia, joining with He-Man to combat Skeletor and his minions. He- Man's original DC comic run finished up with a three-issue miniseries at the start of 1983 (all written by Paul Kupperberg, with artwork by Curt Swan and George Tuska). These issues would introduce the Eternian Royal Family, most notably Prince Adam, and his transformation into He-Man in the series. This version of Adam, however, was originally depicted wearing a blue vest and portrayed as somewhat of a philanderer, rather than his later more wholesome pink-vest-wearing character. Also unique to these issues, Adam transforms inside the \\"Cavern of Power,\\" instead of his more famous \\"By the power of Grayskull!\\" line. The Sorceress, now residing in the Cavern of Power, is still depicted wearing the Teela Snake Armor, and is often referred to as \\"The Goddess\\" throughout the series. Other entries into the Masters of the Universe mythos, such as Cringer as the alter ego of Battle Cat, Zodac as a neutral cosmic enforcer, Stratos as leader of his home world of Avion, and Adam's mother, Queen Marlena, as an astronaut hailing from Earth, were all partly introduced in these early DC issues. =Filmation animated series era= He-Man and the Masters of the Universe ‚Äì Filmation animated series (1983‚Äì84) In 1983, Masters of the Universe would debut perhaps its most famous incarnation, with the animated series He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Created by Filmation under the direction of executive producer Lou Scheimer, the cartoon made its television debut on September 5, 1983, with the episode \\"The Diamond Ray of Disappearance.\\" Running through two seasons, He- Man and the Masters of the Universe was one of the first animated series produced directly for weekday syndication, as opposed to reruns primarily based on Saturday mornings. Totaling 130 episodes, with each season of 65 episodes stretching across 13 weeks, the series last episode, \\"The Cold Zone,\\" on November 21, 1985. Similar to the comics that came before, the series is set on Eternia, which is ruled by King Randor and Queen Marlena (visibly younger in age and with more colorful attire than their previous comic versions). Their son, Prince Adam (now wearing his more familiar pink vest), pretends to be somewhat lazy, clumsy, and irresponsible, much like his pet tiger Cringer (depicted in the series as being very cowardly and with the ability to speak). For the first time, Prince Adam is shown to transform into He-Man by holding aloft his magic sword and saying the magic words, \\"By the power of Grayskull‚Ä¶I have the power!!!\\" It is revealed in the introduction that Prince Adam's secret identity of He-Man is known only by the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull (now with the familiar birdlike costume, who often takes the form of Zoar the falcon), Man-At-Arms (now sporting a mustache and often referred to by his first name Duncan; he is portrayed as scientific inventor as well as a warrior), and Orko (making his full debut as a mainstay in the franchise, Orko is presented as a floating childlike Trollan magician, often used for comic relief and as a point-of-view character for children). Rounding out the main cast of heroes is Teela (now firmly depicted with red hair, she is the Captain of the Royal Guard, the adopted daughter of Man-At-Arms, and secret child of the Sorceress; who serves as a teasing and semi-antagonistic love interest of Adam and He-Man throughout the series). Also featuring in the series with semi-regularity are Stratos (the flying leader of the bird people of Avion) and Ram-Man (portrayed as a dim-witted but likable bouncing warrior). Appearing with much less frequency in the series are He-Man's recurring allies Zodac (less neutral and more of an omniscient cosmic peacekeeper, often assisting He-Man), Man-E-Faces (presented this time as a master of disguise, once mistaken as evil but who turned out to good), Buzz- Off (oddly voiced leader of the bee people), Fisto (debuts as powerful loner and adversary of He-Man before joining forces), Mekaneck (loyal warrior with a bionic neck, searching for his lost son), Roboto (robotic alien explorer marooned on Eternia), Sy-Klone (spinning tornado-like warrior, who appears without a backstory), Moss Man (transforming plant being and enemy of Evilseed), and several characters that would not receive action-figure releases in the original line such as Lizard-Man, the Royal Archeologist Melaktha, Trollans Dree-Elle and Montork, Avion bird people Delora and Hawke, Adam's grandfather King Miro, Squinch and the Widgets, and the wise and ancient dragon Granamyr. He-Man's nemesis, the evil wizard Skeletor (now famously portrayed by voice actor Alan Oppenheimer as a cackling and more comedic villain), still wishes to conquer Castle Grayskull and learn of its secrets, but also now desires to take over the royal palace and rule Eternia; often seeking ancient and mysterious beasts and artifacts to try and stop He- Man and his allies. Skeletor often hosts his rogues gallery inside his headquarters, Snake Mountain, gathered around his bone-filled throne, plotting and peering through a magic orb to spy on He-Man and his friends. Often this group of evil minions consists of the cunning female sorcerer Evil-Lyn (making her full debut into the MOTU mythos as Skeletor's most dangerous counterpart in the Filmation series) and his most frequent sidekicks: the bumbling Beast Man (who possesses the ability to control various creatures through telepathy) and the equally inept weapon-armed Trap Jaw. Skeletor's original henchmen in the cartoon also include Mer-Man (with a distinctive gurgling voice portrayal, also by Alan Oppenheimer), Tri-Klops (with a more robotic voice and persona), and Skeletor's purple pet feline Panthor. Other henchmen making a few appearances later in the series are Webstor (one of Skeletor's more intelligent henchmen, often paired with Kobra Khan), Kobra Khan (menacing Repton able to spray sleeping gas from his cobra hood), Two-Bad (bumbling henchman with two often arguing heads), Spikor (depicted as possibly Skeletor's most dimwitted minion in all of the Filmation series), Modulok (deranged and mutated scientist, once known as Galen Nycroft), Clawful (a far more cunning villain in this version than other representations of the character), and Whiplash (appearing the most out of the later henchmen). Some of Skeletor's rogues would appear only once in the Filmation cartoon, such as Faker (appearing only briefly as a magical clone of He-Man before being tossed into the bottomless abyss outside Castle Grayskull), Jitsu (called \\"Chopper\\" in the script), Batros, Icer, Fang-Man, Dragoon, and Strong-Arm. Other villains not allied with Skeletor would occasionally appear as well, such as the powerful wizard Count Marzo, the plant-demon Evilseed, Kothos, Shokoti, Negator, and the rabbitlike space pirate Plundor, to name a few. Despite the limited animation techniques that were used to produce the series, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe was notable for breaking the boundaries of censorship that had severely restricted the narrative scope of children's TV programming in the 1970s. For the first time, a cartoon series could feature a muscular superhero who engage in on-screen combat (although most of the time wrestling-style moves were utilized instead of direct violence). The cartoon was also groundbreaking in that it was produced in connection with marketing a line of toys, as advertising directly to children was controversial during this period. As an attempt to mitigate the negative publicity generated by these controversies, a \\"life lesson\\" or \\"moral of the story\\" was played at the end of each episode, which was usually tied to the action or central theme of the episode in question (although in the United Kingdom, the closing \\"morals\\" were often edited out of the original broadcasts). The series featured the voice talents of John Erwin, who starred as He-Man/Prince Adam, Beast Man, Ram Man, Webstor, Whiplash, and many others; the aforementioned Alan Oppenheimer, voicing Skeletor, Man-At-Arms, Battle Cat/Cringer, Mer-Man, Buzz-Off, and many others; Linda Gary as much of the female cast with Teela, the Sorceress, Evil- Lyn, and Queen Marlena; and executive producer Lou Scheimer providing the voice work for a multitude of other characters such as Orko, King Randor, Stratos, Trap Jaw, Tri-Klops, Man-E-Faces, Mekaneck, Fitso, Clawful, Kobra Khan, Spikor, and Two Bad, to name a few. The series was often produced by Lou Scheimer and Hal Sutherland and directed by Gwen Wetzler, Marsh Lamore, Lou Kachivas, Steve Clark, Ernie Schmidt, Ed Friedman, and others; with Tom Sito serving as a main storyboard artist, along with Tom Tataranowicz, Warren Greenwood, Robert Lamb, Don Manuel, Bob Arkwright, and many other contributors. Writers on the show included Larry DiTillio, David Wise, Robby London, Michael Reaves, Doug Booth, J. Brynne Stephens, and many others, including early script-writing work from Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski, Paul Dini of Batman: The Animated Series fame, and one episode, \\"Battle Cat,\\" by D. C. Fontana of Star Trek fame. The series, although still popular, would not be renewed for a third season in 1985. Instead, Filmation opted to create the She-Ra: Princess of Power Series, and deliberately crossover the existing He-Man and the Masters of the Universe characters and continuity into the new series. The original He-Man series would end and She- Ra would begin with animated movie The Secret of the Sword, released theatrically in the spring of 1985 and featuring most of the main characters from both cartoons. The two animated series would, however, join up one last time for He-Man & She-Ra: A Christmas Special in December 1985. The special shows two children from Earth who end up accidentally coming to Eternia and being protected by Skeletor, who, in a rare act of kindness, is overtaken by the Christmas spirit. The very last appearance of Filmation's He-Man and Skeletor is in one of the final She-Ra episodes, entitled \\"Assault on the Hive,\\" airing December 13, 1986. Filmation-era MOTU action figures and mini comics (1984‚Äì85) Sales of the toy line continued to increase with the exposure of the animated series, and new waves of figures and vehicles were produced during this peak of popularity. First introduced into the action figure line in 1984 were new \\"Battle Armor\\" versions of He-Man and Skeletor, who could be \\"battle damaged\\" when the mechanism on the figure's chest was pressed. These new renditions of He-Man and Skeletor did not appear in the animated series or the mini comics, but several new characters in the Filmation series found releases in these third and fourth waves of action figures. Making their toy-line debuts in 1984 were He-Man's allies Buzz-Off (\\"heroic spy in the sky\\"; beelike insectoid warrior with wings), Fisto (\\"heroic hand-to-hand fighter\\"; bearded warrior with a large smashing fist as an action feature), and Mekaneck (\\"heroic human periscope\\"; featuring an extending bionic neck). The first action figures for Prince Adam (\\"heroic secret identity of He-Man\\") and Orko (\\"heroic court magician\\"; utilizing a pull-cord feature that sent the figure spinning around when placed on a flat surface) were also produced in this third wave. Skeletor's evil warriors received new recruits as well, with Clawful (\\"warrior with the grip of evil\\"; crab-like creature with an oversize pincer for a hand), Jitsu (\\"evil master of martial arts\\"; human warrior with a gold chopping hand action feature), Kobra Khan (\\"evil master of snakes\\"; reptilian warrior able to be filled with water to spray \\"poison\\" mist on his enemies), Webstor (\\"evil master of escape\\"; spider-faced warrior with a working grappling hook/backpack pulley system), and Whiplash (\\"evil tail-thrashing warrior\\"; reptilian with a rubber tail) all added to the line in 1984. Vehicles produced in 1984 include the Dragon Walker (\\"sidewinding beast/vehicle\\"), Road Ripper (\\"warrior carrier,\\" with a fast- action pull cord), Roton (\\"evil assault vehicle,\\" with a round rotating outer disc), and Stridor (\\"heroic armored war horse,\\" often paired with Fisto). The major playset that year was Skeletor's evil stronghold, Snake Mountain (looking quite unlike the Filmation version, with a giant ghoulish face molded into the plastic and a voice-distorting wolf-headed microphone). Series three of Mattel's MOTU mini comics contained stories similar to the Filmation animated series, with mini comics such as Dragon's Gift, Masks of Power, and Double-Edge Sword adapting stories straight from the first-season episodes of the same name. There were some differences from Filmation, however, as can be seen in The Temple of Darkness mini comic with the Sorceress, now in her birdlike Filmation attire, but in an all-white version of the costume. The mini comics He-Man and the Insect People and The Clash of Arms included many of the new characters from the toy line such as Buzz-Off, Mekaneck, Fisto, Stridor, Webstor, Clawful, and Whiplash; while others such as The Secret Liquid of Life, Slave City, and The Siege of Avion had less to do with the toy line and introduced new original mini-comic characters instead, such as He- Man's childhood friend Prince Dakon, the evil Geldor, the Kobold master Lodar, and Haramesh the demon. The 1985 wave of action figures again included new versions of He-Man and Skeletor with special action features: Thunder-Punch He-Man (whose backpack could be loaded with plastic ring caps to create a loud \\"bang\\" when turning He-Man's waist) and Dragon Blaster Skeletor (which included a small water-squirting dragon chained to Skeletor's armor). Heroic warriors included in the line were Moss Man (\\"heroic spy and master of camouflage\\"; a fuzzy pine-scented retooling of the Beast-Man mold), Roboto (\\"heroic mechanical warrior\\"; featuring moving gears and multiple weapons that could be inserted into his arm socket), and Sy-Klone (\\"heroic fist-flinging tornado\\"; with a dial on his waist allowing his torso to be spun around continuously). Evil warriors in 1985 consisted of Spikor (\\"untouchable master of evil combat\\"; covered in purple rubber spikes with a trident for an arm), Two Bad (\\"double-headed evil strategist\\"; whose spring-action arms allowed the figure to punch himself in either face), and Stinkor (\\"evil master of odors\\"; a foul-smelling reworking of the Mer-Man mold and the only character from the 1985 line that would not make an appearance in the Filmation cartoon). Vehicles produced in this fourth wave were Bashasaurus (\\"heroic combat vehicle\\"; with a large bashing club arm), Battle Bones (\\"collector's carry case\\" and dinosaur skeleton brought to life in the mini comics), Land Shark (\\"evil monster/vehicle\\"; Skeletor's tank with a purple chomping shark mouth), Night Stalker (\\"evil armored battle steed\\"; a recolored Stridor toy, often associated with Jitsu), and Spydor (\\"evil stalker\\"; Skeletor's giant mechanical spider). The largest addition to the 1985 Masters of the Universe toy line came in the form of the Evil Horde, whose characters were set to debut in the animated He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword motion picture. Although villains in the soon-to-debut She-Ra: Princess of Power animated series, five out of the six initial Evil Horde action figures were produced for the Masters of Universe line instead of the Princess of Power toy line (with the Horde villainess Catra being the sole exception). The new main villain Hordak (\\"ruthless leader of the Evil Horde\\") was followed in action- figure form by his underlings, Mantenna (\\"evil spy with the pop-out eyes\\"), Leech (\\"evil master of power suction\\", with suction-cup hands and mouth), Grizzlor (\\"hairy henchman of the Evil Horde\\", with actual imitation fur), and Modulok (\\"evil beast with a thousand bodies\\"; a unique figure with 22 segmented body parts that could be taken apart and reassembled into more than 1,000 different combinations). Hordak's lair, the Fright Zone, was also released as a playset in 1985, although it bore no resemblance at all to the mechanical-/industrial-looking Fright Zone seen in the animated She-Ra series. Series four of the mini comics in 1985 began to depart from some aspects of Filmation's continuity, as each member of the Evil Horde appeared in their own titular mini comic, focusing more on their attempts to attack He-Man and invade Eternia rather than anything She-Ra/Princess of Power‚Äìrelated. Likewise, Skeletor's dragon-blaster and He-Man's thunder-punch powers were never seen in the animated series, but debut here in the mini comics Skeletor's Dragon and The Treachery of Modulok. Roboto also received an alternate origin story in The Battle of Roboto, being a creation of Man-At- Arms rather than a wandering alien, as in the Filmation series. Stinkor and Spikor starred in their own mini comics as well, in The Stench of Evil and Spikor Strikes, which also included Moss Man, Sy-Klone (referred to as \\"Tornado\\"), and the Spydor vehicle. Only the mini comic The Obelisk followed the established continuity more closely and did not feature any of the new characters or vehicles. Michael Halperin and Christy Marx wrote many of the 1984 and 1985 mini comics, while Lee Nordling often served as editor. Larry Houston, Michael Lee, and Alfred Alcala composed most of the artwork for these issues, while DC Comics' Bruce Timm was the illustrator for Grizzlor - The Legend Comes Alive! The introduction of She-Ra and The Secret of the Sword animated feature (1985) In 1985, Mattel and Filmation decided to diversify the Masters of the Universe line beyond its traditional realm of \\"male action,\\" in the hopes of bringing in a young female audience as well. Thus, She-Ra, a feminine warrior-woman heroine, in the same vein as He-Man, was proposed with an all new line of dolls/action figures for girls. In conjunction with the toy line, Filmation would begin work on a new animated series titled She-Ra: Princess of Power, featuring this new main character. She-Ra would be revealed as Princess Adora, the long-lost twin sister of Prince Adam/He-Man, living on Eternia's sister planet of Etheria, ruled by Hordak, the main antagonist of the new series and the tyrannical leader of the Evil Horde. She-Ra would first be introduced in the animated feature He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword, released in theaters on March 22, 1985. The film would feature most major characters from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe and introduce many of the new characters and concepts behind the new series (with the backstory developed by Filmation writers Larry DiTillio and J. Michael Straczynski). She-Ra: Princess of Power ‚Äì Filmation animated series (1985‚Äì86) Filmation's She-Ra: Princess of Power first aired \\"The Sword of She-Ra Part 1: Into Etheria\\" on September 9, 1985. The Secret of the Sword animated movie from earlier that spring was essentially a compilation of what would become the first five episodes of the She-Ra cartoon series. The series would run for three seasons, 93 episodes, from 1985 to 1987. She-Ra: Princess of Power was produced in lieu of continuing He-Man and the Masters of the Universe for a third year; however, He-Man often appeared in episodes of She-Ra to aid his sister, and several other characters from He- Man and the Masters of the Universe, both heroic and evil, also appeared in multiple crossovers. She-Ra was born as Princess Adora on Eternia, Prince Adam/He-Man's twin sister and daughter of King Randor and Queen Marlena. As an infant, Adora is kidnapped by Hordak (vampire/demon-faced sorcerer with a cowl of bones, who can transform his body into various mechanical devices) and Skeletor (Hordak's apprentice at the time) and taken to the world of Etheria (a planet ruled by the Horde, and the main setting of the She-Ra series). Adora is raised and brainwashed by Hordak and his confidant Shadow Weaver (a red-robed witch with a hidden face, powerful in dark magic), to eventually become Force Captain of the Horde. After encountering her brother He-Man (who is on a mission from the Sorceress to find her on Etheria), she eventually acquires the Sword of Protection and seeks to learn the true evil of the Horde. After first transforming into She-Ra and seeing the error of her ways, she becomes a member of the Great Rebellion; a secret small band of rebels, living in the Whispering Woods and fighting to free Etheria from the tyrannical rule of Hordak. Just as Prince Adam transforms into He-Man with the use of his Sword of Power, Adora transforms into She-Ra via her Sword of Protection, a replica of He-Man's sword featuring a smooth blue gem in its hilt. Unlike He-Man's sword, She-Ra's possesses the ability to transform into different weapons and accessories, such as a lasso, a shield, or a flaming blade. Like her brother Adam, however, Adora's transformation into She-Ra is similarly triggered by holding her sword over her head, but with her own unique invocation: \\"For the honor of Grayskull‚Ä¶I am She-Ra!\\" Also similar to He-Man and Cringer/Battle Cat, She-Ra transforms her horse Spirit into the flying unicorn Swift Wind. Though strong like He-Man, She-Ra is shown to have additional powers as well, such as the ability to heal with her touch and communicate with animals via telepathy. The premise of the She-Ra TV series was the reverse of the He-Man cartoon, where the heroes are actually rebels countering an evil establishment (rather than Skeletor trying to conquer Eternia). The Great Rebellion is originally led by Queen Angela (winged queen of Bright Moon, freed by She-Ra from the clutches of Hunga the Harpy) and her daughter Glimmer (pink-haired magic user with the ability to manipulate light), with the main cast of the Princess of Power cartoon also including the skilled archer Bow (the main male heroic character of the series), Bow's timid companion Kowl (a flying owl-/koala-like creature with large rainbow-colored ears), and the absent-minded magician Madame Razz and her wise-cracking sidekick, Broom. Also appearing in many episodes are the small imp-like forest-dwelling Twiggits (mainly Sprockett, Spritina, and Spragg) and the mystical Light Hope, who serves as a \\"Sorceress of Grayskull‚Äìtype\\" guide to She-Ra, residing high atop Mount Skydancer in the Crystal Castle. Throughout the series, recurring characters and members/allies of the Rebellion included Adora's swashbuckling love interest Sea-Hawk, the flirtatious ice queen Frosta, powerful sorcerer queen Castaspella, the mermaid princess Mermista, flower-loving Perfuma, net-tossing Netossa, far-seeing Peekablue, butterfly- like Flutterina, and the intergalactic scout Sweet Bee. With the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon no longer in production, MOTU toy-line characters also appeared in the She-Ra series, such as the elephant warrior Snout Spout (referred to as \\"Hose Nose\\"), and the Comet Warriors Rokkon and Stonedar. A special character, Loo-Kee, was also introduced, hiding somewhere in the background of nearly every episode of the series; emerging at the end of the episode, revealing to viewers where he had been hiding and relating the moral of the story. The ruling antagonist faction of the series, the Evil Horde (whose members are often depicted with a bat-like insignia), is led on Etheria by Hordak (as voiced by George DiCenzo, portrayed with a snorting laugh and temperament slightly more fearsome than Skeletor's), who rules Etheria from the industrial-/technological-looking monstrosity known as the Fright Zone. The Horde enslaves the people of Etheria through Hordak's legions of armored robot-like Horde Troopers, mechanized vehicles, and his special task force of henchman known as the Force Squad. The Force Squad, lead originally by Adora and now by Catra (raven-haired villainess with a magic mask, giving her the ability to turn into a vicious panther), consists of the bug-eyed Mantenna (whom Hordak loves to torment, often dropping him through trapdoors), the fearsome Beast Island operator Grizzlor, the hulking life- force-draining amphibian-like Leech, the whiny shape-shifting Imp, and the pincer-clawed scorpion woman Scorpia. The Horde was later joined by others, including Skeletor's former scientist henchman Modulok, his robotic creation Multi-Bot, the future Snake Men Tung-Lashor and Rattlor, Entrapta the evil inventor with deadly braids, the octopus woman Octavia, the Horde zookeeper Vultak, and the robot Horde Trooper commander Dylamug. The overarching interplanetary supreme leader of the Horde, Horde Prime, who held leadership over both Hordak and Skeletor, was also introduced during the She-Ra Filmation series. Some of the other popular one-off heroes and villains were Spinnerella, Huntara, General Sunder, False-Face, Colonel Blast, the Red Knight, Granita the comet warrior, Sorrowful the Dragon, the Meteorbs, and the Star Sisters. She-Ra and Adora were voiced in the series by Melendy Britt (who also voiced Catra, Castaspella, Mermista, and Octavia); George DiCenzo was the voice of Hordak, Bow, Sea-Hawk, Tung-Lashor, and a few others; and Diane Pershing provided the voice for Netossa and Spinnerella. Alan Oppenheimer and John Erwin would reprise their roles from the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series, as would Linda Gary with Teela and the Sorceress, while providing additional voice work for Glimmer, Madame Razz, Sweet Bee, Shadow Weaver, Scorpia, and Entrapta. Credited as \\"Erik Gunden,\\" Lou Scheimer returned as well to provide voices for a plethora of characters, including Swift Wind, Kowl, Light Hope, Broom, Mantenna, Leech, Grizzlor, Modulok, Horde Prime, Multi-Bot, Rattlor, Orko, the Horde Troopers, and many of the Twiggits; while his daughter, Erika Scheimer, took a more prominent role in this series, providing the voices for Loo-Kee, Queen Angella, Frosta, Imp, and several of She-Ra's female associates. She-Ra: Princess of Power would air its final episode, \\"Swifty's Baby,\\" on December 5, 1986, with no real finale for either the She-Ra or He-Man Filmation series. Princess of Power ‚Äì Mattel toy line (1985‚Äì87) Released in 1985, Mattel's toy line Princess of Power (sometimes abbreviated as POP) featured almost exclusively female characters, all of whom featured an emphasis on hair and clothing, with \\"real\\" hair and partially soft-goods costumes. Described as \\"fashion action dolls,\\" essentially the line attempted to fuse the appeal of Masters of the Universe with Mattel's successful line of fashion dolls, Barbie, and added many \\"Fantastic Fashions\\" clothing accessories packs to complement the female action figures. The 1985 line of Princess of Power figures included She-Ra (without a separate action figure for Princess Adora), Bow (the only male figure in the POP line, without his moustache, as seen in the cartoon series), Glimmer (\\"the guide who lights the way\\"), Kowl (\\"the know-it owl\\"), Angella (\\"angelic winged guide\\"), Frosta (\\"ice empress of Etheria\\"), Castaspella (\\"enchantress who hypnotizes\\"), Catra (\\"jealous beauty\\" and the main female antagonist), and Double Trouble (\\"glamorous double agent\\"; created only for the toy line and mini comics, never appearing in the Filmation cartoon series). She-Ra's main playset was Crystal Castle, a \\"shimmering castle of fantasy and fun for She-Ra and her friends!\\" Enchanta, a large swan creature/vehicle, was also produced in the first wave of toys, as were several horses to accompany the figures: Swift Wind for She-Ra, Arrow for Bow, and Storm for Catra. The Princess of Power toy line ran from 1985 to 1987, for which Mattel would release a total of 22 action figure/dolls (with 12 creatures, two playsets, and 16 clothing accessories). Apart from the main Princess of Power line, the preeminent villains of the She-Ra series, Hordak and the Evil Horde (originally created by Filmation in collaboration with Mattel), were released by Mattel under the Masters of the Universe branding. The character Catra was the only villain to be released in the first wave of the Princess of Power figures, with Mattel downplaying her connection to the Evil Horde in the toy line. In 1986, a new \\"Scratchin' Sound\\" version of Catra was joined by her feline pet Clawdeen and fellow Horde-Villainess Entrapta. She-Ra (with a new \\"Starburst\\" version) was accompanied in the second wave by her allies Flutterina, Mermista, Peekablue, Perfuma, and Sweet Bee. \\"Crystal\\" translucent plastic versions of Swift Wind and the horses Sun Dancer and Moonbeam were also released in wave two, along with the Butterflyer and Sea Harp creature/vehicles and the Crystal Falls playset. The third and final wave saw diminished sales and production in 1987, with the releases of Netossa, Spinnerella, and Loo-Kee; along with \\"Bubble Power\\" She-Ra, \\"Royal\\" Swift Wind, \\"Silver\\" Storm, and \\"Shower Power\\" Catra. Several recurring characters from the She-Ra cartoon did not receive action figures in neither the original POP or MOTU toy lines‚Äîsuch as Madame Razz (or her Broom), Light Hope, the Twiggits, Sea-Hawk, Shadow Weaver, Scorpia, Imp, Octavia, or Hunga the Harpy. She-Ra would also feature in 13 of her own mini comics (packaged with the figures), along with several children's books, comic magazines, and read-along record/cassette-tape books. =Last years of the original toy line= Final action figures and mini comics (1986‚Äì88) The final series of action figures and mini comics, in 1986 and 1987, would continue on the adventures past the animated series and its sequel in the She- Ra line, introducing new characters not seen in the cartoon series such as the heroic warriors: Rio Blast (\\"transforming gunslinger\\"), Clamp Champ (\\"master of capture\\"), and Extendar (\\"master of extension\\"); the evil warriors: Blast- Attak (\\"blast-apart robotic warrior\\"), Ninjor (\\"evil ninja warrior\\"), and Scare-Glow (\\"evil ghost of Skeletor\\"); the Snake Men: King Hiss (\\"dreadful disguised leader of the Snake Men\\"), Sssqueeze (\\"evil long-armed viper\\"), and Snake-Face (\\"most gruesome of the Snake Men\\"); the Hordesmen: Dragstor (\\"transforming warrior/vehicle\\") and Mosquitor (\\"energy-draining insectoid\\"); and the spinning-top-like Energy Zoids: Rotar and Twistoid. Aside from these new characters, longtime MOTU staple characters King Randor (\\"heroic ruler of Eternia\\") and the Sorceress (\\"heroic guardian of Castle Grayskull\\") were finally represented in action-figure form. Other later MOTU characters that had only appeared in the She-Ra: Princess of Power animated series also saw release in the form of the elephant-headed Snout Spout (\\"heroic water-blasting firefighter\\"); the rock warriors: Rokkon (\\"young heroic comet warrior\\") and Stonedar (\\"heroic rock people leader\\"); the Snake Men: Tung Lashor (\\"evil tongue-shooting Snake Men creature\\") and Rattlor (\\"evil Snake Men creature with the quick-strike head\\"); and the Horde members: Multi-Bot (\\"evil robot of a thousand bodies,\\" similar to the prior interchangeable body-segment Modulok figure) and the Horde Trooper (\\"evil collapsing robot\\" and the only generic troop/soldier figures of the toy line). New versions of the lead characters were also produced, with \\"Flying Fists\\" He-Man, \\"Terror Claws\\" Skeletor, and Hordak in two new forms (\\"Hurricane\\" Hordak and \\"Buzz-Saw\\" Hordak). The Evil Horde obtained their first vehicle/creatures in the toy line with Mantisaur (\\"the evil insectoid steed\\") and Monstroid (\\"the ultimate battling monster,\\" that had an entirely different depiction the animated series); while the Horde's Slime Pit playset (a dinosaur-skull-headed torture device) proved to be quite popular in 1986, coming complete with canisters of green ooze to pour over the action figures, while held in place with a giant claw. Also that same year, \\"the land and sky disc launcher,\\" Blaster Hawk, and \\"the road rocket,\\" Laser Bolt, were produced for He-Man's heroic warriors; while Skeletor gained the \\"dragonfly attack vehicle,\\" known as the Fright Fighter. At a less expensive price point, several accessory packs of smaller vehicle/weapons included the Megalaser, Jet Sled, and Stilt Stalkers in 1986; and the Scubattack, Tower Tools, Cliff Climber, Beam Blaster, and Artilleray set and several small transforming egg-shaped creatures, known as Meteorbs, late into the line in 1987. Also late into the line in 1987 were three original characters from the live-action movie: Blade (\\"evil masters of swords\\"), Saurod (\\"evil spark-shooting reptile\\"), and Gwildor (\\"heroic creator of the Cosmic Key\\"), with their entry into the MOTU mythos explained in one of the last original mini comics, The Cosmic Key. No other movie-related figures were produced; however, in 1988, the final action figures of the original toy line, the \\"Laser Power\\" versions of He-Man and Skeletor, did bear some resemblance to their live-action movie counterparts and were released only to European markets. One of the main storylines of the later mini comics, released with these later waves of action figures, was the introduction of a new major villain faction known as the Snake Men, first appearing in the mini comic King of the Snake Men. Kobra Khan, Tung-Lashor, and Rattlor (who previously appeared in the He-Man and She-Ra cartoon series with Skeletor, and/or as members of the Horde), were now under the leadership of the ancient Eternian King Hiss, whose Snake Men army rose from Eternia's past, joining forces with Skeletor to once again rule Eternia (additional Snake Men were later added to the roster in the form of the long-armed Sssqueeze and the medusa-like Snake Face in the mini comic Revenge of the Snake Men). Another major mini comic storyline of this period included the introduction of the three-towered fortress of Eternia in The Ultimate Battleground, which was a massive final playset for MOTU, one of the biggest of all 1980s toy lines, complete with a motorized monorail circling the towers. Other notable mini comics included the debut of Hordak's gruesome mind-altering Slime Pit in Escape from the Slime Pit, one of several origin stories for Rokkon and Stonedar in Rock People to the Rescue, cybernetic Horde experiments resulting in the creation of the warriors Dragstor and Extendar in The Warrior Machine, and the suggested origin of Skeletor as Keldor in The Search for Keldor (which also included the only mini comic appearances for He-Man's ally Clamp Champ, and Skeletor's minions Ninjor, Scare Glow, and Faker). All of this was leading toward what would have been a continuation of the series in \\"The Powers of Grayskull\\" line, before being discontinued. These series five and six mini comics were often edited by Lee Nordling with art direction from Ron Cook, and included writing by Tim Kiplin, Phil White, and Steven Grant, with the artwork of Bruce Timm, Jim Mitchell, Chris Carlson, Charles Simpson, and Larry Houston, among others. The Powers of Grayskull (1987) The proposed exploration of the distant past of Eternia, dubbed \\"Preternia,\\" forms the basis of what was originally to be the next incarnation of the toy line, entitled \\"The Powers of Grayskull.\\" However the toy line was canceled very early on, with only a few toys released (like the dinosaur-themed creatures Turbodactyl, Bionatops, Tyrantisaurus Rex, and the rare Italian-only-released giant figures Tytus and Megator). The main story information originates from the final mini comic The Powers of Grayskull‚ÄîThe Legend Begins!, which was intended as the first of a three-part series; however, only this issue appeared. The proposed storyline was to focus on Ancient Eternia, which was populated by many creatures, including the aforementioned cybernetic dinosaurs and giants. When the Sorceress and He-Man arrive, followed by Skeletor, they find King Hiss leading an attack on a village in the hope of drawing out \\"The Elders,\\" using some of the cybernetic dinosaurs to their advantage. Hiss serves an \\"unnamed one\\" and agrees to unite with Skeletor on the basis that he might be an emissary. Seeing Skeletor's interference, the Sorceress allows He-Man to enter the battle but, \\"for reasons that will be made clear to you in the future,\\" he had to be disguised. He finds himself overwhelmed, but then a shadowy figure appears who turns the odds with a powerful wand. The stranger then sends the Snake Men back to their base and all the time travelers home. The Sorceress describes the intervener as \\"the Greatest Sorcerer of all\\" and He-Man is left asking, \\"But who is he?\\" No further story information is given and it remains unclear how the giants mentioned and released as toys would fit into the story. However, some marketing press releases and prototypes have shed further information on this. The wizard was to be He-Ro, an ancestor of He-Man. Raised by his mentor Eldor and discovering special powers in a cave, He-Ro would have led the fight against the Snake Men. According to the mini comics' writers, it was intended that the central antagonist would be Keldor, a character revealed similarly late in the line to have been He-Man's uncle and also strongly hinted to have been the former identity of Skeletor. Whether or not Keldor was also supposed to be the \\"Unnamed One\\" Hiss served is not clear, although in an interview writer Steven Grant vaguely recalls that the intention was that the Unnamed One would be a greater evil who, as the Emperor was to Darth Vader, was intended to be the one who caused Keldor to become Skeletor. However, when Mattel finally went about creating a definitive identity for the \\"Unnamed One,\\" as part of their Masters of the Universe Classic line, the character was revealed to be an evil Trollan named \\"Gorpo\\" (a nod to the original preproduction name for Orko), who was exiled to Eternia by his race for evil and who used his dark magic to transform normal snakes into humanoid snake people such as King Hiss. Furthermore, additional figures for He-Ro and Eldor (who were made into prototypes but never officially released) were made for the Classic line. =Other comics, books, and media= Marvel comics, daily newspaper strips, and fan-club magazines (1985‚Äì88) In the years after the animated series ended, generally going along with the established Filmation continuity, Marvel Comics would release a younger-skewing Star Comics Masters of the Universe series that ran from 1986 to 1988 bimonthly and produced 13 issues; featuring many of the later characters introduced in the toy line. Apart from the standard comic-book format, there was a He-Man and the Masters of the Universe Magazine, a U.S.-based fan-club magazine featuring puzzles, fan letters, feature stories, and comic strips (running 16 issues, 1985‚Äì88; She-Ra also with a similar magazine, running six issues). This magazine series featured well-rendered covers and posters by artist Earl Norem and a create a character contest, with the winner, Nathan Bitner, revealed in the spring 1986 issue. Bitner's creation, Fearless Photog, was never realized in the 1980s and an action figure was not produced until the Masters of the Universe Classics collector's toy line in 2012. Daily Masters of the Universe comic strips were also in newspaper syndication from 1985 until 1989. The strips were primarily written by Chris Weber and edited by Karen Willson, with distribution in the U.S. and worldwide in countries such as Brazil, India, Greece, and the former Yugoslavia. The newspaper strips were generally lesser known to the wider fan base until 1,639 of the 1,674 daily strips were finally collected in hardcover format with He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Newspaper Comic Strips, released by Dark Horse Books in 2017. International publications (1983‚Äì90) Various comics and magazines containing Masters of the Universe‚Äìrelated content were also released outside the United States, in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Finland, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Italy, and several other countries in the late 1980s. One of the most notable was produced by Egmont's London Editions in the United Kingdom, which published 72 issues biweekly of their By The Power Of Grayskull‚Ä¶Masters Of The Universe comic magazine from 1986 to 1988. The series was headed by Brian Clarke, and is often noted for in-depth stories expanding the canon and the origins of many Masters of the Universe characters. In addition, London Editions would introduce several new characters, such as \\"Scrollos,\\" who served as an in-universe editor and guide to the series. From issue 50 onward, the series would begin to reprint many translated and reworked versions of Ehapa's German Language comics, although original content was still produced for \\"the Secret Files of Scrollos\\" portion of the comic magazine until its demise in late 1988. Fourteen issues of For the Honor of Grayskull She-Ra were also produced by London Editions from 1986 to 1987, as were several one-shot special issues, which included a dual He-Man and She-Ra feature-length adventure in Twins of Power. Starting in 1987, London Editions added a second larger monthly comic magazine entitled Masters of the Universe Adventure, which ran for 18 issues before turning into a New Adventures themed magazine He-Man Adventure for six more issues, before ending the series with four final issues in a best-of format of reprints in 1991. Original comic-book content was created in Germany as well, first by Interpart/Condor for 18 issues from 1984 to 1987, then in Egmont's Ehapa Masters of the Universe comics for 21 issues from 1987 to 1989, with promotional content also appearing in several German Micky Maus comics from the time period. Both the German and British comics were often translated to provide content for other countries (although Italy's Pi√π and Magic Boy magazines provided some original material, as did various South American publishers, notably Estrela and Editora Abril in Brazil). In addition, a few promotional comics and mini comics were also produced by Mattel for various European department stores, often featuring reworked versions of existing comic stories, with few exceptions. Children's books (1983‚Äì90) Masters of the Universe and the Princess of Power featured in many children's books from the 1980s, with one of the main producers of these titles, Golden Books, publishing several series of hard and softcover children's books from 1983 to 1986. The first few releases of the Golden books material is more in line with the early Mattel mini comics, with the later books following the Filmation cartoon series. New elements were also introduced by Golden Books, notably the character of Goat- Man in the book Secret of the Dragon's Egg in 1985. World I.P. also produced annual Masters of the Universe and Princess of Power storybooks in the UK from 1984 until the New Adventures line in 1990. Most World I.P. storybooks would loosely follow the established Filmation continuity, although the 1984 annual edition was written in a pre-Filmation style, naming prominent characters Orko and King Randor as \\"Gorpo\\" and \\"King Miro,\\" respectively. Euredif France produced several Ma√Ætres de l'Univers volumes as well, almost all of them directly based on various episodes of Filmation's He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series. Also notable in the 1980s were the various combination book, record, and cassette tape read-along adventure stories. These included many small hardcover book and cassette tapes produced by Ladybird Books out of the UK, several record and tape read-along book sets from Kid Stuff Records in the U.S., and two book and audio adventures by Mattel, packed in with a rare action-figure two-pack and with the Point Dread and Talon Fighter playset. Games, audio plays, Power Tour, and other media (1983‚Äì87) Several video game adaptations of the franchise were released from 1983 through to 1987. Masters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man was released by Intellivision for Atari 2600 and Intellivision in 1983. Two games, Masters of the Universe: The Arcade Game and Masters of the Universe: The Super Adventure, were developed by Adventure Soft and released by U.S. Gold for Amstrad CPC, BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum in 1987, although the Commodore 64 version of Masters of the Universe: The Arcade Game was retitled Masters of the Universe: The Ilearth Stone. A video game based on the 1987 live-action movie, Masters of the Universe: The Movie, was released by Gremlin Graphics for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum also in 1987. Additionally, various Masters of the Universe board games were released throughout the 1980s, and role-playing game publisher FASA produced The Masters of the Universe Role Playing Game in 1985 with sets of die-cast miniatures created by Grenadier Models. Throughout the 1980s, a wide array of He-Man merchandise was released, including coloring books, activity books, Panini Sticker books, toothbrush holders, costumes, bed sheets, and many other items. Several read-along audio plays were created by Kid Stuff and by Pickwick/Ladybird in the United Kingdom. Notably, a complete Masters of the Universe audio-play adventure LP record was released by Kid Stuff Records in 1983, written and produced by John Braden, with a new He-Man theme song and original voice acting. Also notable were a series of audio cassettes, released in Germany by Europa, consisting of 37 episodes of more than 40 minutes in length, with an additional 10 Princess of Power tapes, and six specials. These cassettes would continue to add to the expanding Masters of the Universe mythos, introducing the world of Anti-Eternia, with an evil alternate universe version of He-Man. Home video releases of Filmation's animated series were produced by RCA/Columbia on VHS and Betamax for 11 volumes with red framed box art, before switching to their Magic Window brand with The Secret of the Sword movie in 1985, for 12 additional He-Man and the Masters of the Universe volumes and 10 She-Ra: Princess of Power VHS releases. Golden Books, Germany's Ocean and Select, and various others also released Masters of the Universe video content in the 1980s. A Masters of the Universe \\"Power Tour\\" live stage show toured across the United States and Canada in 1987, with 19 consecutive performances at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Directed by Tony Christopher, husband-and-wife team Jack and Leslie Wadsworth portrayed He-Man and She-Ra, while Khalos Planchart and Eric Van Baars played lead villains Hordak and Skeletor, respectively. The production also featured lesser used characters such as Rio-Blast, Clamp-Champ, Snout-Spout, Rokkon, Ninjor, Blast- Attak, and songs by an original character, Songster (performed by Doug Howard). =Live-action Masters of the Universe film (1987)= In 1987, a live-action He-Man film was made by Cannon Films entitled Masters of the Universe, released in the United States on August 7, 1987. The film was directed by Gary Goddard and starred Dolph Lundgren in the title role of He- Man, Frank Langella as Skeletor, with Courteney Cox, Robert Duncan McNeill, and James Tolkan in supporting roles (as Julie Winston, Kevin Corrigan, and Detective Lubic, respectively). The other characters from the original cartoon to appear in the film are Evil-Lyn (Meg Foster), Man-At-Arms (Jon Cypher), Teela (Chelsea Field), Beast Man (Tony Carroll), and the Sorceress (Christina Pickles). A new character, Gwildor (Billy Barty), is included in place of Orko, as the special effects of the time were deemed insufficient and too costly. Skeletor's henchmen Blade (Anthony De Longis), Saurod (Pons Maar), and Karg (Robert Towers) were also introduced, in place of other more familiar villains from the established continuity, such as Tri-Klops, Mer-Man, and Trap Jaw. In the film, Skeletor has finally conquered Eternia after stealing the Cosmic Key from the locksmith Gwildor, allowing him to gain entry into Castle Grayskull and imprison the Sorceress. The heroes He-Man, Man-At-Arms, and Teela are joined by Gwildor and escape to the planet Earth using Gwildor's prototype Cosmic Key. Stranded on Earth, they are faced with the task of retrieving their Cosmic Key (which has fallen into the hands of the unwitting humans Julie Winston and Kevin Corrigan) and returning to Eternia, before Skeletor can gain the full power of Castle Grayskull. Skeletor sends his minions to Earth with the mission of recovering the Cosmic Key prototype, as the war between good and evil is transferred to Earth, before returning to Eternia for a final battle between He-Man and a golden-clad godlike Skeletor in the film's climax. Numerous parts of the previously accepted history of the series are omitted in the film, including all references to Prince Adam, Battle Cat, Orko, King Randor, and Queen Marlena. Many reviews of the motion picture criticized its departures from the cartoon, although the movie was produced as an adaptation of the toys only, with Filmation having no involvement in the film. It is also implied that Castle Grayskull itself is the ruling point of Eternia rather than any royal city. The story concentrates more on the science-fiction elements of the franchise rather than the fantasy and the majority of the story takes place on Earth rather than on the world of Eternia. Also departing from all other depictions, He-Man uses a gun in some scenes, instead of his Power Sword, and he is rarely shown displaying his superhuman strength in the film. Although He-Man twice utters his catchphrase \\"I have the power!\\" while holding the sword aloft in the iconic manner, he does omit the prefacing clause \\"By the power of Grayskull.\\" Although Mattel had hoped that the movie would boost sales of the toy line, it instead had little effect on the line's falling sales, and the MOTU toy line was finally discontinued in early 1988 under mounting financial difficulties. A sequel to the film was written, but by 1989 Cannon Films was in such severe financial troubles that it could no longer afford to pay the license fees to Mattel. Thus the script was transformed into the action film Cyborg, starring Jean- Claude Van Damme. =The New Adventures of He-Man (1990‚Äì91)= The New Adventures animated series In 1990, a couple of years after the ending of the original Masters of the Universe product line, a second He-Man animated series titled The New Adventures of He-Man was created by Jetlag Productions to promote Mattel's short-lived attempt to revive the MOTU brand with a new toy line, simply titled He-Man. The new series is radically different from the original fantasy-oriented milieu, shifting to an almost purely science-fiction setting that sees He-Man transported to the futuristic planet of Primus. He- Man (with a new, more slender appearance and sporting a ponytail; voiced by Doug Parker) leads the heroic Galactic Guardians; while Skeletor (also with a completely new look; voiced by Campbell Lane), bases himself on the mutant world of Denebria, forming an alliance with Flogg and his band of Evil Mutants, who are hellbent on conquering Primus for themselves. The series contains continuity links to the original Masters of the Universe and was intended as a continuation of the existing mythology, although some fans see it as a separate canon from the original series due to the differences in style and character portrayal. Other than He-Man and Skeletor, the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull is the only character from the original series to make regular appearances in the new series, acting as a spiritual guide to He-Man from afar. Other established characters featured in the pilot episode, \\"A New Beginning,\\" include King Randor and Queen Marlena, who finally learn of the dual identity of Prince Adam and He-Man. Teela also makes a later appearance in the series in the episode \\"Once Upon a Time,\\" although she bears little resemblance to her former Filmation counterpart. Main characters introduced in this series are He-Man's new allies: the wise sage Master Sebrian, his assistant Mara, and the lead Galactic Guardians Captain Hydron and Flipshot. Other frequently appearing heroic characters include the young shepherd girl Drissi, her little brother Caz, the scientists (Alcon, Gepple, Krex, and Meldoc), the robots Gleep and UR, Grot the gardener, councilman Werban, the cyclops Meliac, and the remaining Galactic Guardians: Sagitar, Tuskador, Spinwit, and Artilla; with the final members Kayo, Vizor, and Nocturna rarely featuring in the show (although they did appear in the comics and series intro). Skeletor's allies in Flogg's band of Evil Mutants consist mainly of Flogg's incompetent second-in-command Slush-Head, Skeletor's new love interest Crita, and other mutants such as Quakke, Staghorn, B.H., Hoove, Karatti, Optik, and Lizorr. The New Adventures of He-Man cartoon series first aired September 17, 1990, lasting 65 episodes, until the episode \\"The Final Invasion,\\" which aired on December 14, 1990, and, unlike Filmation, did provide some closure to the series. The majority of the cartoon episodes were written by Jack Olesker, resulting in a somewhat tighter continuity than the prior series. The He-Man toy line, debuting in 1989, a year earlier than the animated series, featured four waves of action figures (produced in slightly smaller scale to the previous line); totaling 28 distinct figures in all, with seven vehicles, two playsets, and two accessory items. Neither The New Adventures animated series or toy line proved nearly as popular as the originals, and the line ended with little fanfare in 1992. The New Adventures of He-Man series was also featured in its own series of four mini comics and in a monthly comic magazine entitled He-Man Adventure, which ran for about six issues, before returning to adventures on Eternia and was published by Egmont's London Editions Magazines in the UK; World I.P. also produced a New Adventures‚Äìthemed annual in 1990. These publications differed somewhat from the animated series with the addition of the character Darius (who did not appear in the cartoon series) in a major role as leader of the Galactic Council; the transition of the \\"Power of Castle Grayskull\\" into the Starship Eternia; and several of the figures sporting alternate names in some media and toy-line releases, such as Flipshot as Icarius, Flogg as Brakk, and Slush-Head as Kalamarr. =Hiatus ‚Äì Proposed series, pop culture, and commemorative releases (1992‚Äì01)= The Masters of the Universe franchise would not produce any new media for over a decade, although a new series was pitched by Lou Scheimer to DIC Entertainment in 1996. The series was to feature He-Ro (alter- ego Dare), now the son of He-Man, as a sequel to the original animated series, but remained unproduced. During this hiatus, Masters of the Universe also began a following on the early days of the internet, with sites developed by Kevin Herbert (one of the first), Adam Tyner (with the Scrolls of Grayskull newsletter), Busta-Toons (with focus on the Filmation animated series), and many others; eventually ending up with the expansive He-Man.org site being created. Various popular internet memes were also created, with Masters of the Universe being reviewed by popular YouTube channels and parodies such as Unemployed Skeletor or Wil Wheaton's \\"Skeletor Reads Angry Tweets\\" segment. Masters of the Universe would also appear many times on the Adult Swim stop- motion comedy series Robot Chicken (which introduced comedic character Mo- Larr). Both He-Man and Skeletor are often mentioned in pop culture, as seen on the long-running animated series The Simpsons on a few occasions. In 2000, however, Mattel did act on the growing nostalgia for the 1980s action figures by rereleasing replicas of many of the figures, under the banner of the Masters of the Universe Commemorative line. BCI Eclipse LLC (and later Mill Creek Entertainment) would expand on this, later releasing all episodes of the Filmation He-Man and the Masters of the Universe on DVD in Region 1 in 2005/2006; followed by She-Ra: Princess of Power and JetLag's New Adventures of He-Man series. Each volume contained an extensive array of special features, including original documentaries produced for the DVD set that featured interviews from many series creators and writers such as Lou Scheimer, Larry DiTillio, Paul Dini, and others. =Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen series (2002‚Äì04)= Reboot and new Masters of the Universe toy line In 2002, Mattel launched a new Masters of the Universe toy line with sculpts designed by the Four Horsemen. The new toy line was made surprisingly faithful to the original line, with the characters gently \\"reimagined\\" and updated in terms of sculpting detail rather than radically reinterpreted. Sixty action figures were released in all, with 10 creature figures, seven vehicles, and three playsets (eight smaller-scale figures were also produced in a McDonald's Happy Meal promotion). One point of contention for many fans of the original Masters toy line was the redesign of He-Man's Power Sword. According to Four Horsemen, this was due to their original re- sculpts being intended for a continuation of the original storyline in which Skeletor had obtained both halves of the Power Sword (hence the new Skeletor figure's dual blades with clear \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" hilt designs), necessitating a new sword to be built by Man-At-Arms and endowed with the properties of the original by the Sorceress. However, Mattel decided to reboot the continuity for a new generation of children, and thus the \\"new\\" Power Sword design became the \\"original\\" version for the new continuity. Another issue was the overreliance on releasing alternate versions of He-Man (13 in total), Skeletor (10), Man-At-Arms (5), and a few other main characters, rather than further classic, reimagined, and original characters from the accompanying animated series (such as Randor, The Sorceress, Clawful, or Chief Carnivus, to name a few); making many of the non-He-Man or Skeletor figures hard to come by for both collectors and children. These factors likely contributed to the cancelation of the line in 2004 and ultimately not achieving the success of its 1980s counterpart. The line's faithfulness to the original series made it very popular with collectors, however, suggesting it would have been better served as a collector-based line, akin to DC Direct. This theory was borne out in the wake of the discontinuation of the mass-market toy line, with NECA taking the rather unprecedented step of continuing the toy line through action-figure-size mini-statues scaled and sculpted to be aesthetically compatible for display alongside the Mattel toys. NECA would produce 22 \\"staction figures\\" in total, allowing fans to fill out their collections with other Four Horsemen redesigned characters that had yet to be produced as figures when the toy line was canceled. According to a December 8, 2005, interview with a Mattel representative on he-man.org, NECA offered to produce fully articulated action figures for Mattel without taking any credit, but permission was denied. Instead, NECA was only permitted to produce non- articulated statues, which they did from 2005 to 2007. 200X Animated series ‚Äì Mike Young Productions A new animated series was produced to accompany the toy line, made by Mike Young Productions and lasting for 39 episodes, with the series making its premiere on Cartoon Network's Toonami on August 16, 2002, and airing its final episode on January 10, 2004. This series involved much tighter continuity and a somewhat greater depth of characterization than its Filmation predecessor. A similar but slightly modified premise to the original Filmation series, this version of He-Man (voiced by Cam Clarke, with Prince Adam portrayed as physically younger and smaller than He-Man) was part of an ensemble of Eternian heroes/protectors known officially as \\"The Masters.\\" Under the leadership of Man-At-Arms (voiced by Garry Chalk), this team originally consisted of He-Man/Adam (with his pet Cringer/Battle Cat, no longer able to speak), Teela, Orko, Stratos, Ram-Man, Mekaneck, and Man-E-Faces, and later joined by Buzz-Off, Roboto, and Sy-Klone. King Randor was now a general (rather than king, from an Eternian royal lineage), pronounced ruler of Eternia by the Elders of the Hall of Wisdom, which have gone into hiding inside the depths of Castle Grayskull. Skeletor (voiced by Brian Dobson), now confirmed as Keldor, finally breaks through the great barrier wall (after decades of trying) and attacks The Masters with his evil forces; mainly consisting of Evil-Lynn, Beast-Man, Mer-Man, Trap-Jaw (now a cybernetically repaired henchman, formerly known as Kronis), Tri-Klops (now an inventor/scientist, somewhat akin to an evil Man-At-Arms), Claw-ful (now a very large and extremely dim-witted thug), and Whiplash (now also of larger size and of the subterranean Caligar race). Backstories of occasional characters such as Fisto, Moss-Man, Webstor, Zodak (regarded a different character as opposed to the earlier Zodac), Two-Bad (portrayed as two bounty hunters known as Tuvar and Baddhra, magically combined into one being by Skeletor's magic), and Stinkor (finally making an appearance in cartoon continuity as the mutated form of Odiphus) are all expanded upon. On-and-off villains Count Marzo and Evilseed return, while new characters such as Dekker, Carnivus, Ceratus, Lord Dactys, Prahvus, the Faceless One, and the giants Chadzar, Belzar, and Azdar are also introduced in this series. The series was originally title He-Man and the Masters of the Universe like the original 1983 series, being retitled Masters of the Universe vs. the Snake-Men towards the end of the first season, in addition sidelining Skeletor as chief villain in favor of King Hiss, leader of the reptilian Snake Men (Kobra-Kahn, General Rattlor, Tung-Lashor, Snake-Face, and Sssqueeze), with He-Man and many of the characters now bearing a new \\"Snake-Armor\\" look. He-Man's ancestor King Grayskull and his Sorceress wife Veena also debuted in this season against his nemesis Hordak (now an ancient sorcerer). Hordak and the Evil Horde were to be the main antagonists for the third season if the show had continued, but it was not renewed. The 40th and final episode was produced as a comic-book \\"special feature\\" on the last DVD set of the series, which was part of a three-volume release, originally by BCI Eclipse in 2008 (and later in a collected release by Mill Creek Entertainment in 2009 and 2012). 200X MOTU video games A game based on Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen, titled He-Man: Power of Grayskull, was developed by Taniko and published by TDK Mediactive in October 2002 for the Game Boy Advance, which also featured an introductory mini comic. A follow-up developed by Savage Entertainment and published by Midas Interactive Entertainment, He-Man: Defender of Grayskull, was released for PlayStation 2 in February 2005. Comic series by MVC and Image Comics From 2002‚Äì05, Image Comics and MVCreations published several series of comics and one-shots that mirrored tales of Masters of the Universe vs. The Snakemen; the comic series elaborated and added to the mythos by introducing characters that never made it in after the 39 episodes of the television series. The first issues were seen in the summer of 2002 in the form of special promotional/preview issues, with three miniseries continuing on after: \\"The Shards of Darkness\\" in fall 2002, followed by \\"Dark Reflections\\" and \\"Rise of the Snake Men\\" in 2003. After delving into the backstories of Skeletor's henchmen Beast-Man, Mer-Man, Trap-Jaw, and Tri-Klops in a four-issue \\"Icons of Evil\\" series, a short-lived ongoing series, solely produced by MVC, continued on for eight issues in 2004. Along with these, a handful of special or \\"pack-in\\" one-shots and trade paperback collected volumes were also produced. Current Masters of the Universe properties =MOTU Classics, Super7, and other collector's toy series (2008‚Äìpresent)= In 2007, a new incarnation of Masters of the Universe was announced, with the first action figure, King Grayskull, released at San Diego Comic Con 2008. Based on the look of the original 1980s MOTU toys, this new toy line was aimed primarily at the adult toy collector market, often available only through subscriptions (from MattyCollector). Sculpted by the Four Horsemen, these toys were updated versions of previous figures as well as characters that never before had an action figure made of them; such as Filmation's Queen Marlena, Fang-Man, Lizard-Man, Count Marzo, Granamyr, and many others. The toy line featured many redesigned and updated action figures from the original action- figure line from the 1980s, but it also included characters from She-Ra: Princess of Power (Adora, Madame Razz, Scorpia, Shadow Weaver, and others), The New Adventures of He-Man (Mara, Crita, and more), and the Mike Young Productions series from 2002 (Faceless One, Chief Carnivus, King Chooblah, Ceratus, and others). As the line progressed, characters from all versions of MOTU lore were included, from such things such as prototypes and concept art (He-Ro, Eldor, Demo-Man, Gygor, Vykor, and others), box art from vehicles and model kits (Sky High and the Fighting Foe Men), mini comics (the Goddess, Geldor, and Procrustus), and other books, comics, and media (Despara, Strobo, Goat-Man, and more). There were also newly created figures, exclusive to the Classics toy line, such as Draego-Man, Cy-Chop, Castle Grayskullman, and others. In February 2010, the figures of He-Man and Skeletor were available as Toys \\"R\\" Us exclusives packed in two-packs with Superman and Lex Luthor, respectively, from Mattel's DC Universe Classics action -figure line; with this dual line expanded to include two-packs featuring Aquaman/Mer-Man, Hawkman/Stratos, Bizarro/Faker, Supergirl/She-Ra, and finally Green Lantern/Zodac. Masters of the Universe Classics surpassed the original 1980s toy line in terms of length, running continuously for seven years with more than 150 different figures produced since its launch in August 2008. Along with the Classics series, MOTU Minis and Giants figures were also released in 2014 and 2015. In 2016, Mattel ended production on the MOTU Classics and MattyCollector.com's Club Grayskull series, with the production company Super7 now taking over the Masters of the Universe license. Super7 has thus far produced several 3¬æ\\" figures (in the style of the classic Kenner Star Wars action figures from the late 1970s to early 1980s) and many figures in the style of the small pink M.U.S.C.L.E./Kinkeshi also from the 1980s. Super7 releases include 1980s Mattel-inspired figures from their animation special, The Curse of the Three Terrors, the Masters of the Universe \\"Ultimates\\" line (which consists of \\"deluxe\\" rereleases of Classics figures), and the continuation of the previous Classics and Club Grayskull lines. =New mini comics, books, and other media (2012‚Äìpresent)= Starting in 2012, Dark Horse Comics produced mini comics included in Mattel's Masters of the Universe Classics line of toys, continuing the series of mini comics first introduced in the original MOTU toys of the 1980s. The initial three mini comics were written by Tim Seeley and drawn by Wellinton Alves, with covers by Eric Powell. The Dark Horse mini comics continue the storyline The Powers of Grayskull/Preternia that was to have been the direction the original action figure line was headed before it was canceled. In these issues, He-Man goes back in time to battle King Hiss, finally bringing He-Ro, Eldor, Tytus, and Megator into the storylines and introducing newly created Classics characters such as Sir Laser-Lot and the Mighty Spector. Seeley stated that these comics were intended to blend the different He-Man continuities and select the best stories and ideas from MOTU history. DC took over the Masters of the Universe Classics mini comics from Dark Horse in 2013, publishing five more mini comics, with stories from Scott Neitlich and artwork by Wellinton Alves and Axel Gim√©nez. These mini comics provide an origin story of Keldor (Skeletor), and then proceed to join into the later New Adventures of He-Man continuity. The Fall of Eternia saga in the final issues incorporates the proposed Dare, son of He-Man (He-Ro II) series from the 1990s, along with many \\"Create-a- character\\" contest finalist designs from the 1980s Masters of the Universe Magazine. Many of these stories are meant to be read in conjunction with the altered continuity presented in the character biographies on the cardbacks of the Masters of the Universes Classic's line action figure packaging, and thus do not provide a detailed flowing narrative in the mini comics themselves. With the 8th and last mini comic published in 2015, it is uncertain if DC will continue to produce any future mini comics in this series with Super7 taking over the Masters of the Universe Classics line in late 2016. Dark Horse Books continues to produce various hardcover anthology books with collaborative efforts from Val Staples, James Eatock, Josh de Lioncourt, Danielle Gelehrter, Eric Marshall, Jukka Issakainen, David Clark, Aidan Cross, Leanne Hannah and others. Volumes include the \\"Art of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe,\\" \\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe Minicomic Collection,\\" \\"He-Man and She-Ra: A Complete Guide to the Classic Animated Adventures,\\" \\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Newspaper Comic Strips,\\" and \\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: A Character Guide and World Compendium.\\" An Android and iOS game, He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe, was developed by GlitchSoft and published by Chillingo and Mattel in late 2012; later followed by He-Man‚Ñ¢ Tappers of Grayskull for the iOs (which also includes an updated She-Ra's Adventure version). For many years now, fan-sites such as He-Man.org, Planet Eternia, and Wiki Grayskull, podcasts such as Masters Cast and the annual Power-Con convention, have all served and promoted the Masters of the Universe brand in recent years. Masters of the Universe was also featured in the 3rd episode of the first season of the well received Netflix series The Toys That Made Us in 2017 and in 2018 with the release of the Power of Grayskull: The Definitive History of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe documentary, also on Netflix. =DC Comics ‚Äì Current series (2012‚Äìpresent)= A Masters of the Universe comic book series was relaunched by DC Comics in 2012, first appearing as a series of digital comics. This was quickly followed by a six-issue mini-series and all new revised origin issues for He-Man, Skeletor and Hordak. After a crossover mini-series with superheroes from the DC Comics universe in 2013, an ongoing series ran for 19 issues through 2014, before being replaced by the \\"He-Man The Eternity War\\" 15-issue series in 2015/2016. This introduced a new back-story for He-man's sister She-Ra (as Despara), Skeletor (as the half-Gar son of King Miro), Hordak, and the Snakemen; moving the storyline further along, with a new Horde invasion of Eternia and He-Man taking the Eternian throne, amongst other new developments. He-Man/ThunderCats, a crossover with another heroic 1980s action figure line, ThunderCats, was also produced for six issues in 2016‚Äì2017 and a six-part crossover series with DC Comics' Injustice Storyline was released in 2018. The next DC Comics MOTU property will be 'He-Man and the Masters of the Multiverse', beginning in November 2019, with a six issue limited series, written by Tim Seeley. =She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018‚Äì2020)= On December 12, 2017, DreamWorks Animation SKG and Netflix announced a new reboot series based on She-Ra Princess of Power series from the 1980s. The series is executive produced by award-winning author, Noelle Stevenson (creator of Nimona and Lumberjanes). The series' first season of thirteen episodes was released on Netflix November 13, 2018. The DreamWorks series features a new animation style and alternate backstories for many of the characters, many of whom are presented as younger in age and with a more diverse makeup than in the previous 1980s Filmation series. Adora/She-Ra is again presented as a former member of the Horde, befriended by re-imagined versions of Glimmer and Bow (with new voice actors Aimee Carrero, Karen Fukuhara and Marcus Scribner, respectively). Under the direction of Glimmer's mother Queen Angella of Bright Moon, the three embark upon re-uniting the Princesses of Etheria, which include Perfuma, Mermista, Entrapta and Frosta, each with re-imagined characters as well. Also appearing in the series are Swift Wind (without the alter ego of Spirit and with a completely different take on the character's personality), Light Hope (as a female hologram generated by the \\"First Ones\\"), Sea Hawk (now presented as a more comical glory-seeking associate of Mermista), Castaspella (as the sister of Angella's husband King Micah), Madame Razz (as an older and confused forest dweller with knowledge of Mara, a prior \\"She-Ra\\"), Netossa and Spinnerella (princesses not often featured, in limited speaking roles). The evil Horde returns as the villainous overlords of Etheria, and although Hordak remains leader of the Horde, Catra is often presented as the primary antagonist (now voiced by AJ Michalka), with a much stronger relationship established between her and Adora. Shadow Weaver (Lorraine Toussaint) and Scorpia (Lauren Ash) also play prominent roles within the series, and cadets Lonnie, Rogelio and Kyle are introduced (possibly inspired by previous Filmation characters). Overarching galactic villain Horde Prime and a re-imagined shape-shifting Double Trouble enter the series in later seasons, and other previously established villains appearing in lesser roles are Admiral Scurvy, Tung Lashor, Grizzlor, Imp and Octavia. Although no longer directly linked to He-Man or the Masters of the Universe, Eternia, Castle Grayskull and Adora's kidnapping as a child are referenced. Season two of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power was released on Netflix on April 26, 2019, with a shorter seven-episode run; soon followed by season three, also in 2019 on August 2, and season 4, on November 4 of that year. While firmly establishing a new continuity, these seasons make further connections to previously established lore and characters, and include Geena Davis voicing the role of Huntara in season three. The series aired its fifth and final season on May 15, 2020. =New animated series ‚Äì Masters of the Universe: Revelation= In August 2019, Kevin Smith announced at the 2019 Power Con that he and Netflix are developing a new series titled Masters of the Universe: Revelation that will be a direct sequel to He-Man and the Masters of the Universe that follows Teela searching for the missing Power Sword. On February 14, 2020, the full voice cast was confirmed. Mark Hamill will provide the voice for Skeletor and Chris Wood will voice Prince Adam and He-Man. =New animated series ‚Äì Masters of the Universe (CGI revival)= In December 2019, it was announced that in addition to their other series, Netflix will also be developing a new Masters of the Universe series using CGI animation, with Rob David developing the series, producing it alongside Adam Bonnett, Christopher Keenan, Jeff Matsuda and Susan Corbin. Bryan Q. Miller will serve as story editor on the series. Animation services are being provided by House of Cool and CGCG Inc. =Reboot film= Since 2007, a reboot of Masters of the Universe has been in the works but has gone through development hell with various studios, directors and writers connected to the project. Variety reported in 2007 that Grayskull: Masters of the Universe would be produced by Joel Silver, and written by Justin Marks, and employing visual special effects to a large degree, as was done with the 2007 war film 300. With that deal to reboot the film going nowhere, Warner Bros. announced that John Stevenson, director of Kung Fu Panda, was slated to direct the upcoming feature. On May 12, 2009, it was announced that the scripting duties had been handed to newcomer Evan Daugherty, with John Stevenson still attached to direct. In September 2009, Sony took over the rights from Warner Bros. to produce the Masters of the Universe live-action film after Mattel and Silver couldn't agree on creative direction for the film. Sony and Escape Artists' Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch were now developing the project from scratch for Columbia. In April 2010, Sony hired screenwriters Mike Finch and Alex Litvak to draft a new script. Deadline reported that Jon M. Chu was in talks to direct the film. Original He-Man actor Dolph Lundgren did an interview with IGN about possibly appearing in the film as King Randor. On October 12, 2012, Richard Wenk was hired to rewrite the script for the film. On March 28, 2013, Chu said that the film was still early in its development and that it would not be campy, but rather a dramatic origin story. On October 7, 2013, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Terry Rossio would write the film; Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, and Steve Tisch were assigned to produce it. The film would be set on Eternia. The site also reported that Chu would not direct the film. On February 26, 2014, it was reported that directors Jeff Wadlow, Mike Cahill, Harald Zwart, and Chris McKay were on the short list to direct the film. On April 9, 2014, Schmoes Know reported that Wadlow would direct the film, but The Hollywood Reporter announced that he was merely rewriting the script. Columbia Pictures Senior Vice President DeVon Franklin tweeted that Jeff Wadlow had completed the script. Franklin later tweeted a photo on his Twitter page of Battle Cat. On August 19, 2015, Variety reported that Christopher Yost would rewrite the script. Mike O'Hearn announced on his Instagram account that he was in training to star as He-Man. However, he then quashed the rumor, saying he only wanted to do the part and was not cast for the live-action movie. On January 22, 2016, Deadline reported that McG would direct the film and also oversee a rewrite of the latest script by Alex Litvak and Mike Finch, while Escape Artists' Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal and Steve Tisch and as well as DeVon Franklin were now on board as producers. On June 24, 2016, Kellan Lutz tweeted on his Twitter page that he had a meeting with both McG and Mary Viola about taking the role of He-Man. McG told IGN that the role of He-Man had not been cast yet, but that Lutz was being looked at very closely for the part. This draft of the script would be set on Eternia, but not exclusively there. In addition, pre-production had moved on to doing makeup testing. McG commented on the film saying, \\"I think we want to honor the fan base, first and foremost, We also need to be cognizant of the incredible resonance of what Kevin Feige is doing with Marvel, and the balance of full-bodied entertainment. That it's both credible and emotional, action- packed, and the story of a hero's journey. It's the genesis of He-Man, it's the becoming of He-Man. We want it to be clicking on all cylinders in that regard. We're not going to stop until we get it right.\\" On April 26, 2017, Sony confirmed that the film would finally be released on December 18, 2019. Along with the release date confirmation it was announced that McG was no longer directing the film. During the search for his replacement, Entertainment Weekly reported that David S. Goyer had been brought in to write the script. In December 2017, further reports said that Goyer was in talks to direct the film; however, in February 2018 Variety reported that Goyer had decided to step away as director to focus on other projects, but stated he would remain on board as an executive producer and screenwriter, and that the studio was said to be very happy with the script he turned in and is currently meeting with potential replacements. In April 2018, another Variety report stated that the Nee Brothers were set to direct the film. On January 11, 2019, Deadline reports that Art Marcum and Matt Holloway will rewrite a new draft for the film. Principal photography will begin on July 15, 2019, and wrap on October 18, 2019, with Prague as one of the shooting locations. On February 13, 2019, it was reported that principal photography on the film will begin in mid-July 2019 in Prague and will be directed by the Nee Brothers. On March 20, 2019, it was reported that Noah Centineo is in talks to play He-Man. On April 29, 2019, Centineo, in an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, confirmed that he will be playing He-Man in the upcoming film. Sony announced that the film's release date has changed to March 5, 2021. In October 2019, The Hollywood Reporter had reported a rumor that Sony would sell the movie to Netflix. On January 24, 2020, the film has been taken off its release schedule with the film adaptation of Uncharted, which also got its release date changed, taking its place before that film changed its release date again. Reboot CGI-animated series On December 18, 2019, it was announced Netflix and Mattel Television will produce a CGI-animated series reboot of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe.

Early life and family Von Rosen was born in Helgesta, Flen Municipality, S√∂dermanland, Sweden and grew up on Rockelstad Castle. He was the son of the explorer Count Eric von Rosen (1879‚Äì1948), co-founder of National Socialist Bloc, and baroness Mary Fock (1886‚Äì1967). He was nephew of Carin G√∂ring, wife of Hermann G√∂ring. Throughout his upbringing, Carl Gustaf appeared to have had serious differences in opinion with his family, with one author referring to him as the \\"black sheep of his family.\\" One brother, Bj√∂rn (1905‚Äì1989), was a writer, graphic artist and painter. The sister Birgitta Wolf (1913‚Äì2009) was a writer and human rights activist. At an early age, Carl Gustaf was interested in mechanics; his subsequent fascination with flying machines was likely influenced by his uncle, who was a fighter ace during World War I (and later head of the German Luftwaffe). He was a student at Lundsbergs boarding school from 1920 to 1926 and at AB Aeromateriel's flight school in 1929 and took the pilot's license test in the same year. Von Rosen took the airline pilot exam in 1934. Von Rosen himself started his flying career as a mechanic before becoming an aerobatic stunt pilot in a travelling circus. Second Italo-Ethiopian War, 1935-1936 When the Italians under Benito Mussolini attacked the independent empire of Ethiopia, von Rosen joined the Swedish Red Cross ambulance mission. He also repeatedly flew casualties out from the battlefield under extremely dangerous conditions. This activity resulted in him receiving mustard gas burns due to the use of the gas by the Italian Air Force. After his return from the war in Ethiopia, he went to the Netherlands to join KLM, the first public airline in the world, and became one of their foremost pilots. Second World War Von Rosen's happiness with his second wife, Hanny, ended with the outbreak of World War II. She joined the resistance, was arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Dachau in Germany. After the war she committed suicide in 1949. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland in 1939 in the Winter War, von Rosen quit his job to fly bombing missions for the Finns. He purchased a KLM Douglas DC-2, had it converted to a bomber in Sweden, and made one operational mission in March 1940 against the Soviet Union with it. Later the same year, as the Germans attacked the Netherlands, von Rosen with a Dutch KLM-crew flew a DC-3 with Dutch government documents to England and applied for service with the RAF but was turned down, on account of his family relation to Hermann G√∂ring. Carl Gustaf von Rosen went on flying for the Swedish airline AB Aerotransport (ABA) from August 1940 until the end of the war. Post war Between 1945 and 1956 von Rosen worked in Ethiopia as the chief instructor for the Imperial Ethiopian Air Force. Afterwards von Rosen was employed by the Swedish charter airline Transair. The company was engaged by the UN during the Congo Crisis 1960. Von Rosen also served as the pilot for the second Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. However, von Rosen was grounded by illness when Hammarskj√∂ld was killed in an air crash while mediating in the Congo Crisis. Biafran War Von Rosen's involvement in Africa did not end with the Congo Crisis. He gained international fame seven years later when he flew relief missions for aid organisations into war torn Biafra, a breakaway republic of Nigeria. These flights included flying a DC-7 from S√£o Tom√© to Uli at only a little above sea level in August 1968. Disgusted at the suffering the Nigerian government inflicted on the Biafrans and the continuous harassment of international relief flights by the Nigerian Air Force, he hatched a plan in collaboration with the French secret service to strike back at Nigerian air power. He imported five small civilian single engine MFI-9 planes produced by Malm√∂ Flygindustri, at that time owned by SAAB, which he knew could also be used for a ground attack role in warfare. He had the planes painted in camouflage colours and fitted with license manufactured 68 mm SNEB type rockets, and proceeded with a crew of two Swedes and two Biafrans to form a squadron called 'Biafra Babies' to strike the air fields from which the federal Nigerian Air Force launched their attacks against the civilian population in Biafra. On 22 May 1969, and over the next few days, von Rosen and his five aircraft launched attacks against Nigerian air fields at Port Harcourt, Enugu, Benin and other small airports. The Nigerians were taken by surprise and a number of expensive jets, including a few MiG-17 fighters and three out of Nigeria's six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers, were destroyed on the ground.Gary Brecher. Biafra: Killer Cessnas and Crazy Swedes 15 October 2004. The Igbo intellectual Fola Oyewole who fought for Biafra recalled of all the Westerners who served with the Biafrans that Rosen was the most idealistic and the one who cared about the Igbos as a people the most. Despite his controversial methods, Count von Rosen would later be remembered for his efforts to modernize relief efforts to remote conflict zones. One of the notable figures assisting Count Carl Gustav von Rosen was Lynn Garrison, an ex-RCAF fighter pilot. He introduced the Count to a Canadian method of dropping bagged supplies to remote areas in Canada without losing the contents: a sack of food was placed inside a larger sack before the supply drop. When the package hit the ground, the inner sack would rupture, but the outer one kept the contents intact. With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation. Later models of the Malm√∂ Flygindustri MFI-9 became the SAAB MFI-15 Safari, with official modifications, developed from the Biafran concept, to facilitate the dropping of food supplies from underwing hard points. Von Rosen was utilizing this type in Ogaden when he was killed during a rebel ground assault. Grave to Carl Gustaf von Rosen in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Return to Ethiopia From 1974 to 1977 he flew aid for famine and drought victims in Ethiopia. The last action Count von Rosen saw was again in Africa in 1977, during the Ogaden War between Ethiopia and Somalia. Again flying famine relief for refugees, he was killed on the ground on 13 July 1977, during a sudden Somali army attack in Gode at the outbreak of the war. He was buried in Gulale cemetery, Addis Ababa. Personal life von Rosen was married 1932-1936 to Stina Maria Theresia (Mille) Wijkmark (1911-1994) and 1938-1943 to Johanna (Hanny) Franciena Krijgsman (1912-1949). In 1943 he married Gunvor Lilian Martin (born 1917), daughter of the artist Seth Martin and baroness Lily Fock. von Rosen was the father of Nils Gustaf (born 1932), Margaretha (born 1938), Yvonne (born 1940), Astrid (born 1945), Eric (born 1950) and Carl (born 1953).

Description  It is a medium-sized bird, in length, and is characterized by its white belly and black back and wings. The tips of the long tail feathers are white. The eyes are yellow; the beak is red and presents a stocky casque on the upper mandible. In females, the casque is smaller. The crowned hornbill can be distinguished from the similar Bradfield's hornbill by its shorter beak.  Habitat  The crowned hornbill is a common resident of the coastal and riverine forests of southern (only the eastern coast) to northeastern Africa.  Diet  It forages mainly in trees, where it feeds on insects (often caught in flight), small rodents, small reptiles, seeds and fruits. This hornbill species can be seen in flocks, usually in the dry season. Four to five white eggs are incubated for 25 to 30 days; the juveniles remain with both parents for about 8 weeks.

Yellow-billed hornbills feed mainly on the ground, where they forage for seeds, small insects, spiders and scorpions. This hornbill species is a common and widespread resident of dry thornveldt and broad-leafed woodlands. They can often be seen along roads and water courses.  Description  Adult female in Mapungubwe National Park, South Africa. She has a shorter bill, with shorter casque, than the male. It is a medium-sized bird, in length, in weight and is characterized by a long yellow and down-curved beak. This beak is huge in comparison to its body and can account for up 1/6th of the entire body length. Male beaks are on average 90 mm long while female beaks are an average of 74 mm. Males are generally bigger than females but there is overlap between the sexes. The size difference of the beak is a fairly reliable way of differentiating sex in wild hornbills. The casque that characterizes all hornbills is of a very modest size in the southern yellow- billed hornbill. It is small, but it covers almost the entire length of the beak in males (less so in females), and may give the impression that they do not actually have a casque. As in all hornbills, the size of the beak actually intrudes on the frontal vision of the bird and the first two neck vertebrae are fused together. Also, like most other hornbills, they possess a long tail, long eyelashes, stubby legs and stubby toes. The front three toes are fused together near the base. They have white belly, grey neck, and black back plumage with abundant white spots and stripes. The neck has gray spots and the chest is lightly striated with black. Southern yellow-billed hornbills have no plumage pigmentation save for melanin, which can only produce shades of black and white. The eyes are usually yellow, though brown has also been seen. The skin around the eyes and in the malar stripe is pinkish. The related eastern yellow-billed hornbill from north-eastern Africa has blackish skin around the eyes.  Distribution and habitat  These birds are near endemic to the dry savannas of southern Africa, where they can be found across all longitudes, from Angola and Namibia in the west to Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal in the east, including Botswana, Zimbabwe and northern South Africa. The southern yellow-billed hornbill lives mostly in the dry, open savannas, but they are also very partial to woodlands when they can find them. When in woodlands, they seem to prefer acacia and broadleaved woodlands. The highest reported concentration of southern yellow-billed hornbill is in open mopane scrub.  Behaviour  The southern yellow-billed hornbill is active during morning, day and evening. At night, it will sleep high in a tree so it won't be preyed on. They can be found alone, in couples or in small groups. They generally tend to be loners unless it is breeding season, nesting season or if there is local migration during dry season. The southern yellow-billed hornbill is often seen searching for food on the ground or in shrubs. It will not dig the ground, but it will overturn debris to find insects. It can also be seen pursuing insects by hopping heavily after it. They are generally sedentary and they will defend their territories with elaborate displays. However, during the dry season, they will sometimes range widely in order to find food. Couples are usually monogamous and have a clear division of labour between males and females. They have been known to live for up to 20 years in captivity, though their longevity in the wilds remains unknown.  Flight  The southern yellow- billed hornbill flies powerfully. It alternates short gliding periods with heavy wing beats. The southern yellow-billed hornbill lacks the underwing coverts which enhances the flow of air when it flies.  Vocalization  Southern yellow-billed hornbills have a piercing cry. However it has a wide variety of sounds it can make such as, whistling, grunting and caqueting. They will use their loud calls to either delimit their territory or for long- distance communication. Like other Tockus, they will often accompany their calls with conspicuous physical displays.  Diet  Southern yellow-billed hornbill eats mostly arthropods, particularly termites, beetles, larvae (beetles and termites), grasshoppers and caterpillars. It has also been seen eating centipedes and scorpions. They will occasionally eat small mammals when they can. To complete the diet, they will regularly eat berries, fruits, nuts and eggs from other species. Southern yellow-billed hornbill use their beaks as a pair of forceps. They will grasp their food between the tips and then toss it back in their throat where the short, stubby tongue will assist in swallowing the food. The inner cutting edges of the beak are serrated to facilitate the crushing and fragmentation of food. Most of the food is picked from the ground or from low vegetation. Their diet has some overlap with that of the southern ground hornbill .  Reproduction  Breeding season starts when the first autumn rain falls. The breeding season goes from September to march with the egg-laying peak between October and December. Eggs are laid during the wet season so different areas will have different peaks according to the local rainy season. For example, the peak generally occurs from November to February in the eastern regions and from December to March in the northwest regions of the southern yellow-billed hornbill's range. These peaks coincide with the peak rainfall of the year. Young birds become sexually mature when they are one year old. However, before the actual breeding is done, there is the courtship feeding of females, mutual preening, copulation and prospecting of nests sites that must be done. Once the male southern yellow-billed hornbill has mated, it will stay with his mate and establish a territory that it will defend. The nests are placed in natural cavities in trees, cliffs or earth banks between 1 and 12 meters from the ground. The male then proceeds to bring bark, leaves and grass which will be put on the bottom of the nest. During this time, the female will seal herself inside the nest by blocking the entry with a wall made from her droppings and food remains. The male will help by bringing mud for her to work with. The only opening left is a vertical slit from the top to the bottom. The male passes the food through the slit with his beak. The female and chick droppings are forcibly expelled through the slit as well. The vertical slit provides good air circulation through convection and when coupled with the wooden walls, it provides a good insulation. Nests usually contain 2-6 eggs and take about 24 days to hatch. The eggs are white, oval and have finely pitted shells. The chicks are born naked and with pink skin. They and the female are fed by the male who brings back food and drops it through the slit. Most nests will also have a long escape tunnel in case a predator breaks in the nest to eat them. Taking advantage of the fact that she is imprisoned; the female will shed all of her flight and tail feathers simultaneously and regrow them during the time she stays with the chicks. Once the chicks are half-grown, the female will break out of the nest in order to help the male. The chicks will rebuild the wall themselves and continue to be fed through the slits by the parents. Once the chicks are fully grown, they will break out of the nest and start flying.  Interactions with humans  Hornbills have a unique look, so many cultures give them an important place in their beliefs. Some indigenous tribes revere hornbills as sacred beings that must not be harmed. Others will hunt them for food, to use them in the confection of traditional medicine or to use them in rituals.

She was the third child, out of four, and only daughter of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his wife Sara Fricker. Early life Coleridge was born at Greta Hall, Keswick. Here, after 1803, the Coleridges, Robert Southey and his wife (Mrs. Coleridge's sister), and Mrs. Lovell (another sister), widow of Robert Lovell, the Quaker poet, all lived together; but Coleridge was often away from home; and Uncle Southey was a paterfamilias. The Wordsworths at Grasmere were their neighbours. Sara's son Herbert Coleridge Wordsworth, in his poem, \\"The Triad\\", has left us a description, or poetical glorification, as Sara Coleridge calls it, of the three girls: his own daughter Dora, Edith Southey and Sara Coleridge, the last of the three, though eldest born. Greta Hall was Sara Coleridge's home until her marriage; and the little Lake colony seems to have been her only school. Guided by Southey, and with his ample library at her command, she read by herself the chief Greek and Latin classics, and before she was twenty-five had learnt in addition French, German, Italian and Spanish.Barbeau, 10. Career Sara's daughter Edith Coleridge In 1822, Sara Coleridge published Account of the Abipones, a translation in three large volumes of Martin Dobrizhoffer,Barbeau, 13. undertaken in connection with Southey's Tale of Paraguay, which had been suggested to him by Dobrizhoffer's volumes; and Southey alludes to his niece, the translator (canto, iii, stanza 16), where he speaks of the pleasure the old missionary would have felt if In less grandiloquent terms, Charles Lamb, writing about the Tale of Paraguay to Southey in 1825, says, \\"How she Dobrizhoffered it all out, puzzles my slender Latinity to conjecture.\\" In 1825, her second work appeared, a translation from the medieval French of the Loyal Serviteur, The Right Joyous and Pleasant History of the Feats, Jests, and Prowesses of the Chevalier Bayard, the Good Knight without Fear and without Reproach: By the Loyal Servant. In September 1829, at Crosthwaite Parish Church, Keswick, after an engagement of seven years duration, Sara Coleridge was married to her cousin, Henry Nelson Coleridge (1798‚Äì1843), younger son of Captain James Coleridge.Barbeau, 27. He was then a chancery barrister in London. The first eight years of her married life were spent in a little cottage in Hampstead. There four of her children were born, of whom two survived. In 1834, Mrs. Coleridge published her Pretty Lessons in Verse for Good Children; with some Lessons in Latin in Easy Rhyme. These were originally written for the instruction of her own children, and became very popular. In 1837, the Coleridges moved to Chester Place, Regent's Park; and in the same year appeared Phantasmion, a Fairy Tale, Sara Coleridge's longest original work, described by critic Mike Ashley as \\"the first fairytale novel written in English\\".Ashley, Mike. \\"Coleridge, Sara\\" in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy edited by John Clute and John Grant. London, Orbit, 1999. . Historian of literature Dennis Butts describes Phantasmion as a \\"remarkable pioneering fantasy\\" and \\"an extraordinary monument to her talent\\".Dennis Butts, \\"The Beginnings of Victorianism\\", in Children's Literature: An Illustrated History edited by Peter Hunt. Oxford University Press, 1995. The songs in Phantasmion were much admired at the time by Leigh Hunt and other critics. Some of them, such as \\"Sylvan Stag\\" and \\"One Face Alone\\", are extremely graceful and musical, and the whole fairy tale is noticeable for the beauty of the story and the richness of its language. Some historians of the fantasy genre believe Phantasmion may have influenced the work of George MacDonald. Later life In 1843, Henry Coleridge died, leaving to his widow the unfinished task of editing her father's works. To these she added some compositions of her own, among which are the essay \\"On Rationalism, with a special application to the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration\\", appended to Coleridge's Aids to Reflection; the preface to Essays on his Own Times, by S. T. Coleridge; and the introduction to Biographia Literaria.Barbeau, 116. In 1850, Coleridge discovered a lump in her breast. Her physician decided not to operate, prescribing cod liver oil and opium. Knowing there was no cure, she waited for the disease to take its course. \\"I live in constant fear\\", Coleridge wrote, \\"like the Ancient Mariner with the Albatross hung about his neck, I have a weight always upon me.\\"Griggs, Earl Leslie (1940). Coleridge Fille: A Biography of Sara Coleridge. London: Oxford University Press. Shortly before she died she amused herself by writing a little autobiography for her daughter. This, which reaches only to her ninth year, was completed by her daughter, and published in 1873, together with some of her letters, under the title Memoirs and Letters of Sara Coleridge. The letters show a cultured and highly speculative mind. They contain many apt criticisms of known people and books, and are specially interesting for their allusions to Wordsworth and the Lake Poets. Sara Coleridge died of breast cancer in London on 3 May 1852. Family Coleridge suffered a number of miscarriages and only two of her children, Herbert and Edith, survived to adulthood. Two of Coleridge's children died in infancy. Her son, Herbert Coleridge (1830‚Äì1861), won a double first class in classics and mathematics at Oxford in 1852. He was secretary to a committee appointed by the Philological Society to consider the project of a standard English dictionary, a scheme of which the New English Dictionary, published by the Clarendon Press, was the ultimate outcome. His personal researches into the subject were contained in his Glossarial Index to the Printed English Literature of the Thirteenth Century (1859). Her daughter, Edith Coleridge, edited a biography of Sara, The Memoir and Letters of Sara Coleridge (1873), which helped to preserve her mother's legacy.

Fossil remains are also known from North America. it encompasses 246 species of frogs divided between five genera. For lack of a better vernacular name, they are commonly called megophryids. Morphology The megophryids are notable for their camouflage, especially those that live in forests, which often look like dead leaves. The camouflage is accurate to the point of some having skin folds that look like leaf veins, and at least one species, the long-nosed horned frog (Megophrys montana) has sharp projections extending past the eye and nose, which disguise the frog shape. Megophryids range in size from in length. The adults' tongues are noticeably paddle-shaped. Their tadpoles can be found in a variety of waters, but especially ponds and streams. The tadpoles are extremely diverse in form because of the variety of habitats they inhabit. Genera The following genera are recognised in the family Megophryidae: * Subfamily Leptobrachiinae (Pseudomoustache Toads; 162 species) ** Leptobrachella Smith, 1925 (Borneo frogs; 82 species) ** Leptobrachium Tschudi, 1838 (Eastern spadefoot toads; 37 species) ** Oreolalax Myers and Leviton, 1962 (19 species) ** Scutiger Theobald, 1868 (cat-eyed toads; 24 species) *Subfamily Megophryinae (106 species) ** Megophrys Kuhl and Van Hasselt, 1822 (Asian Spadefoot Toads; 106 species) Evolution The origin of this group of frogs was largely unknown, due to the lack of members of this family in the fossil record. While the family was originally considered to have originated in the early-mid Cretaceous (100-126 mya) via fossils of related frog groups, a study in early 2017 revealed that this was likely an overestimation. Using DNA sequencing, the study indicated the group more likely originated much later during the Cretaceous period, around 77 mya. The study also indicated that there are likely many more new species in the family that are currently unknown to science. While the family is currently restricted to Asia, fossils indicate that it once had a much wider distribution extending to North America. The earliest known fossils of this family are from the Eocene of Wyoming in the United States. References * (2004): Encyclopedia of Reptiles & Amphibians (2nd ed.).

He is believed to have served out his seven-year term, although there are unconfirmed reports of clashes between master and apprentice, and even that Dayes had Girtin imprisoned as a refractory apprentice. Certainly Dayes did not appreciate his pupil's talent, and he was to write dismissively of Girtin after his death. While a youth, Girtin became friends with J. M. W. Turner and the teenagers were employed to colour prints with watercolours. Girtin exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1794. His architectural and topographical sketches and drawings established his reputation, his use of watercolour for landscapes being such as to give him the credit of having created Romantic watercolour painting. He went on several sketching tours, visiting the north of England, North Wales and the West Country. By 1799, he had acquired influential patrons such as Lady Sutherland, and the art collector Sir George Beaumont. He was the dominant member of the Brothers, a sketching society of professional artists and talented amateurs. In 1800, Girtin married Mary Ann Borrett, the 16-year-old daughter of a well- to-do City goldsmith, and set up home in St George's Row, Hyde Park, next door to the painter Paul Sandby. By 1801, he was a welcome houseguest at his patrons' country houses such as Harewood House and Mulgrave Castle, and able to charge 20 guineas for a painting, but his health was deteriorating. In late 1801 to early 1802, he spent five and a half months in Paris, where he painted watercolours and made a series the pencil sketches which he engraved on his return to London. They were published as Twenty Views in Paris and its Environs after his death. In spring and summer 1802, Girtin produced a panorama of London, the \\"Eidometropolis\\", 18 feet high and 108 feet in circumference which was exhibited with success that year. It was notable for its naturalistic treatment of urban light and atmosphere. That November, Girtin died in his painting room; the cause was variously reported as asthma, consumption, or \\"ossification of the heart.\\" He was buried in the churchyard of St Paul's, Covent Garden in London. Girtin's early landscapes are akin to 18th-century topographical sketches, but in later years he developed a bolder, more spacious, romantic style, which had a lasting influence on English painting. The scenery of the north encouraged him to create a new watercolour palette of warm browns, slate greys, indigo and purple. He abandoned the practice of undershadowing in grey wash and then adding pastel patches of colour, in favour of broad washes of strong colour, and experimented with the use of pen, brown ink and varnish to add richer tones. Girtin's early death reportedly caused Turner to remark, \\"Had Tom Girtin lived I should have starved.\\" =Exhibitions and retrospectives= The British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum have collections of his work. The British Museum was given significant Girtin watercolours by the collector Chambers Hall. In July 2002 Tate Britain organised an exhibition, Thomas Girtin: The Art of Watercolour which aimed to \\"reveal his technical genius\\".Dorment, Richard.

It is currently the rarest species of hyena.Chapter 4: Rich Man's Table from David MacDonald‚Äôs The Velvet Claw BBC books, 1992 The largest remaining brown hyena population is located in the southern Kalahari Desert and coastal areas in Southwest Africa. The global population of brown hyena is estimated by IUCN at a number between 4,000 and 10,000 and its conservation status is marked as near threatened in the IUCN Red List.  Habitat  The brown hyena inhabits desert areas, semi-desert, and open woodland savannahs. It can survive close to urban areas by scavenging. The brown hyena favors rocky, mountainous areas, as they provide shade and it is not dependent on the ready availability of water sources for frequent drinking. Home ranges are in size.  Description  A skull at the National Museum of Natural History, National Mall in Washington, D.C. Brown hyenas are distinguished from other species by their long shaggy dark brown coat, pointed ears, and short tail. Their legs are striped brown and white, and adults have a distinct cream-colored fur ruff around their necks. Erectile hairs up to in length cover the neck and back and bristles during agonistic behavior. Body length is on average with a range of . Shoulder height is and the tail is long. Unlike the larger spotted hyena, there are no sizable differences between the sexes, although males may be slightly larger than females. An average adult male weighs , while an average female weighs . Brown hyenas have powerful jaws. Young animals can crack the leg bones of springboks within five minutes of birth, though this ability deteriorates with age and dental wear. The skulls of brown hyenas are larger than those of the more northern striped hyena, and their dentition is more robust, indicating a less generalized dietary adaptation.  Behavior  Brown hyena stealing springbok kill from cheetahs. = Social behavior = Brown hyenas have a social hierarchy comparable to that of wolves, with a mated pair and their offspring. They live in clans composed of extended families of four to six individuals. Clans defend their territory, and all members cooperate in raising cubs. Territories are marked by 'pasting',Mills, M. G. L., M. L. Gorman, and Margaret EJ Mills. \\"The scent marking behaviour of the brown hyaena Hyaena brunnea.\\" South African Journal of Zoology 15.4 (1980): 240-248. during which the hyena deposits secretions from its large anal gland, which is located below the base of the tail and produces a black and white paste, on vegetation and boulders. Brown hyenas maintain a stable clan hierarchy through ritualized aggressive displays and mock fights. A brown hyena male can move up in rank by killing a higher ranking male in confrontation, while the alpha female is usually just the oldest female in the clan. Emigration is common in brown hyena clans, particularly among young males, which will join other groups upon reaching adulthood. = Reproduction and life cycle = The brown hyena does not have a mating season. Female brown hyenas are polyestrous and typically produce their first litter when they are two years old. They mate primarily from May to August. Males and females in the same clan usually do not mate with each other, rather females will mate with nomadic males. Clan males display no resistance to this behavior, and will assist the females in raising their cubs. Females give birth in dens, which are hidden in remote sand dunes far from the territories of spotted hyenas and lions. The gestation period is around 3 months. Mothers generally produce one litter every 20 months. Usually, only the dominant female breeds, but if two litters are born in the same clan, the mothers will nurse each other's cubs, though favoring their own. Litters usually consist of 1‚Äì5 cubs, which weigh at birth. Unlike spotted hyenas, brown hyenas are born with their eyes closed, and open them after eight days. Cubs are weaned at 12 months and leave their dens after 18 months. Also unlike spotted hyenas, all adult members of the clan will carry food back to the cubs. They are not fully weaned and do not leave the vicinity of their den until they reach 14 months of age. Brown hyenas reach full size at an age of around 30 months and have a life span of about 12 to 15 years. = Dietary habits = Brown hyenas are primarily scavengers the bulk of whose diet consists of carcasses killed by larger predators, but they may supplement their diet with rodents, insects, eggs, fruit and fungi (the desert truffle Kalaharituber pfeilii). They are however poor hunters, and live prey makes up only a small proportion of their diet: in the southern Kalahari, species such as springhare, springbok lambs, bat-eared foxes and korhaans constitute only 4.2% of their overall diet, while on the Namib coast, cape fur seal pups compose 2.9% of their food. They have an exceptional sense of smell and can locate carcasses kilometers away. Brown hyenas are aggressive scavengers, frequently appropriating the kills of black-backed jackals, cheetahs, and leopards. Single brown hyenas may charge at leopards with their jaws held wide open and can tree adult male leopards; they have been observed treeing leopards even when no kill was in contention. In the Kalahari Desert, brown hyenas are often the dominant mammalian carnivores present because of this dominance behavior and the relative scarcity of lions, spotted hyenas, and packs of African wild dogs. In areas where they overlap, brown hyenas may on rare occasions be killed by spotted hyenas and lions. In the Kalahari, 80% of a brown hyena's activity time is spent at night, searching for food in an area on spanning on average, with territories of having been recorded. They may cache excess food in shrubs or holes and recover it within 24 hours.  Threats and conservation status  The global population of brown hyena is estimated by IUCN at a number between 4,000 and 10,000. They are listed as near threatened in the IUCN Red List. The major threat to brown Hyenas is human persecution based on the mistaken belief that they are harmful to livestock. Farmers will find hyenas scavenging on livestock carcasses and wrongly assume that hyenas have killed their property. Brown hyena body parts are also occasionally used for traditional medicines and rituals, but the species is not as sought after as the spotted hyena. The brown hyena is not in high demand for trophy hunting. The only major predator of hyenas is the African lion. Hyena cubs are especially susceptible to lion predation. There are several conservation areas that are home to the brown hyena, including the Etosha National Park in Namibia, the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (South Africa/Botswana). The maintenance of these protected areas aids in the conservation of these animals. Educational campaigns are being utilized to promote awareness about hyenas and dispel prevailing myths, while problem individuals are removed from farmlands and urbanized areas.

Emerson is best known for his roles in films by pop artist Andy Warhol, and as a member of the seminal glam punk group, the Magic Tramps. Career Growing up in New Jersey, Emerson trained as a classic ballet dancer. It was this talent that caught the eye of artist and filmmaker Andy Warhol. After seeing Emerson dancing at The Dom in April 1966, Warhol asked Emerson to be in one of his underground films. Emerson made his film debut in 1967's Chelsea Girls, and soon became a Factory regular. Emerson starred in other Warhol films, most notably Lonesome Cowboys, San Diego Surf, and Heat. Heat would be Emerson's last film. Emerson began his musical career with The Magic Tramps. The band, which began in Hollywood in 1969, relocated to New York City in 1971 after Emerson joined as lead vocalist. The Magic Tramps played under various names, including Messiah and Star Theater, and played gigs at Max's Kansas City, a favorite hangout among Factory regulars. They were one of the early bands to play at CBGB. Later that year, Emerson appeared in Jackie Curtis' play Vain Victory: Vicissitudes of the Damned, with Ondine, Holly Woodlawn, and Candy Darling, and music by the Magic Tramps and Lou Reed. =Album cover lawsuit= When the debut album of The Velvet Underground and Nico was first issued, the main back cover photo (taken at an Exploding Plastic Inevitable performance) featured an image of Emerson projected upside- down on the wall behind the band. Emerson threatened to sue over this unauthorized use of his image unless he was paid. Rather than complying, MGM recalled copies of the album and halted its distribution until Emerson's image could be airbrushed from the photo on subsequent pressings. Copies that had been printed were sold with a large black sticker covering the actor's image. The image was restored for the 1996 CD reissue. Personal life Emerson's bisexuality was well known within Warhol's circle and he had relationships with many of the Factory regulars. When Emerson's father accused his son of being \\"a little sweet\\", Emerson responded by saying, \\"What he don't understand is that my generation can swing both ways\\".Watson, Steven, Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties, Pantheon Books, 2003, . page 275 On July 21, 1969, Emerson agreed to marry Warhol superstar, Jackie Curtis. When Emerson failed to show up, Curtis married a wedding guest. The wedding, which was a publicity stunt arranged by Curtis, was covered by The Village Voice. Emerson has two children from two prior relationships. He had a son, Branch Emerson, with Stilettos singer Elda Gentile. In 1970, he and model and actress Jane Forth, who appeared in Warhol's Women in Revolt, L'Amour, Trash, and Bad, had a son named Emerson Forth. At the time of his death, Emerson was living with Barbara Winter, ex-wife of musician Edgar Winter. Death On May 28, 1975, Emerson's body was found next to his bicycle, near the West Side Highway in Manhattan. Emerson's death is listed officially as a hit and run. He was 29 years old. To date, no one has been arrested or charged in connection with his death. Following a weekend-long wake hosted by Max's Kansas City owner Mickey Ruskin, Emerson was buried in Wharton, New Jersey. After Emerson's death, various reports surfaced that he was not killed in a hit and run accident, but overdosed on heroin in a different location, and was dumped as a staged hit and run.Watson, Steven, Factory Made: Warhol and the Sixties, Pantheon Books, 2003, . page 427 These reports have never been substantiated, and Emerson's official cause of death never has been changed. In the book Making Tracks, Debbie Harry provided an account of the circumstances surrounding Emerson's death: > One night we were over at Eric's apartment working on a tape of \\"Heart of > Glass\\" on his Teac fourtrack tape recorder, when he suddenly staggered out > of the kitchen looking ashen. He looked even more distraught and sad when we > left. Being satisfied drove him crazy in the end, because he had everything > so he didn't care about anything anymore.

The next day we were > sitting around the house just after we woke up when Barbara called with the > bad news. \\"Oh, Eric got hit by a truck.\\" He had been a good friend and > inspiration to so many people. We didn't quite understand what had happened, > but we went up to a party/wake held for him and saw a lot of people from the > earlier glitter days.

In gram-negative bacteria an outer membrane is also included. This envelope is not present in the Mollicutes where the cell wall is absent. Bacterial cell envelopes fall into two major categories: a gram-positive type and a gram-negative type, distinguished by Gram staining. Either type may have an enclosing capsule of polysaccharides for extra protection. As a group these are known as polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria. Function As in other organisms, the bacterial cell wall provides structural integrity to the cell. In prokaryotes, the primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cell from internal turgor pressure caused by the much higher concentrations of proteins and other molecules inside the cell compared to its external environment. The bacterial cell wall differs from that of all other organisms by the presence of peptidoglycan (poly-N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid), which is located immediately outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the bacterial cell wall and for the determination of cell shape. It is relatively porous and is not considered to be a permeability barrier for small substrates. While all bacterial cell walls (with a few exceptions e.g. intracellular parasites such as Mycoplasma) contain peptidoglycan, not all cell walls have the same overall structures. This is notably expressed through the classification into gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Types of bacterial cell envelopes =The gram-positive cell wall= Schematic of typical gram-positive cell wall showing arrangement of N-Acetylglucosamine and N-Acetylmuramic acid; Teichoic acids not shown. The gram-positive cell wall is characterised by the presence of a very thick peptidoglycan layer, which is responsible for the retention of the crystal violet dyes during the Gram staining procedure. It is found exclusively in organisms belonging to the Actinobacteria (or high %G+C gram- positive organisms) and the Firmicutes (or low %G+C gram-positive organisms). Bacteria within the Deinococcus-Thermus group may also exhibit gram-positive staining behaviour but contain some cell wall structures typical of gram- negative organisms. Imbedded in the gram-positive cell wall are polyalcohols called teichoic acids, some of which are lipid-linked to form lipoteichoic acids. Because lipoteichoic acids are covalently linked to lipids within the cytoplasmic membrane they are responsible for linking the peptidoglycan to the cytoplasmic membrane. Teichoic acids give the gram-positive cell wall an overall negative charge due to the presence of phosphodiester bonds between teichoic acid monomers. Outside the cell wall, many Gram-positive bacteria have an S-layer of \\"tiled\\" proteins. The S-layer assists attachment and biofilm formation. Outside the S-layer, there is often a capsule of polysaccharides. The capsule helps the bacterium evade host phagocytosis. In laboratory culture, the S-layer and capsule are often lost by reductive evolution (the loss of a trait in absence of positive selection). =The gram- negative cell wall= Schematic of typical gram-negative cell wall showing arrangement of N-Acetylglucosamine and N-Acetylmuramic acid and the outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide. The gram-negative cell wall contains a thinner peptidoglycan layer adjacent to the cytoplasmic membrane than the gram-positive wall, which is responsible for the cell wall's inability to retain the crystal violet stain upon decolourisation with ethanol during Gram staining. In addition to the peptidoglycan layer the gram-negative cell wall also contains an additional outer membrane composed by phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides which face into the external environment. The highly charged nature of lipopolysaccharides confer an overall negative charge to the gram -negative cell wall. The chemical structure of the outer membrane lipopolysaccharides is often unique to specific bacterial strains (i.e. sub- species) and is responsible for many of the antigenic properties of these strains. As a phospholipid bilayer, the lipid portion of the outer membrane is largely impermeable to all charged molecules. However, channels called porins are present in the outer membrane that allow for passive transport of many ions, sugars and amino acids across the outer membrane. These molecules are therefore present in the periplasm, the region between the plasma membrane and outer membrane. The periplasm contains the peptidoglycan layer and many proteins responsible for substrate binding or hydrolysis and reception of extracellular signals. The periplasm is thought to exist as a gel-like state rather than a liquid due to the high concentration of proteins and peptidoglycan found within it. Because of its location between the cytoplasmic and outer membranes, signals received and substrates bound are available to be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using transport and signalling proteins imbedded there. In nature, many uncultivated Gram-negative bacteria also have an S-layer and a Capsule (microbiology). These structures are often lost during laboratory cultivation. =Mycobacteria (Acid-fast bacteria)= The Mycobacteria have a cell envelope which is not typical of gram-positives or gram-negatives. The mycobacterial cell envelope does not consist of the outer membrane characteristic of gram-negatives, but has a significant peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan-mycolic acid wall structure which provides an external permeability barrier. Therefore, there is thought to be a distinct 'pseudoperiplasm' compartment between the cytoplasmic membrane and this outer barrier. The nature of this compartment is not well understood.IC Sutcliffe, DJ Harrington.Lipoproteins of mycobacterium tuberculosis: an abundant and functionally diverse class of cell envelope components. FEMS Microbiology Reviews 28 (2004) 645-759 Acid-fast bacteria, like Mycobacteria, are resistant to decolorization by acids during staining procedures. The high mycolic acid content of Mycobacteria, is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention. The most common staining technique used to identify acid-fast bacteria is the Ziehl-Neelsen stain or acid-fast stain, in which the acid fast bacilli are stained bright red and stand out clearly against a blue background. =Bacteria lacking cell wall= The obligate intracellular bacteria in family Chlamydiaceae are unique in their morphology as they do not contain detectable amounts of peptidoglycans.Chopra I, Storey C, Falla TJ, Pearce JH. Antibiotics, peptidoglycan synthesis and genomics: the chlamydial anomaly revisited. Microbiology. 1998 144 ( Pt 10):2673-8. However, the extracellular forms of these gram-negative bacteria maintain their structural integrity because of a layer of disulfide bind cross-linked layer of cysteine-rich proteins, which is located between cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane in a manner analogous to peptidoglycan layer in other gram- negative bacteria.Hatch TP. Disulfide cross-linked envelope proteins: the functional equivalent of peptidoglycan in chlamydiae? J. Bacteriol. 1996 178:1‚Äì5. In the intracellular forms of the bacterium the disulfide cross linkage is not found, which confers this form more mechanically fragile. The cell envelopes of the bacterial class of mollicutes do not have a cell wall. The main pathogenic bacteria in this class are mycoplasma and ureaplasma. L-form bacteria are strains bacteria that lack cell walls derived from bacteria that normally possess cell walls.

In April 2004, it attracted massive negative national attention after placing an advertisement in a Gulfport, Florida weekly The Gabber' suggesting the killing by firing squad of United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The language used in the ad parodied that used by Rumsfeld referring to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The advertisement generated short-lived but high-profile attention in the national news media as a result of its hyperbolic tone, and was condemned by leaders of both major political parties. As a result, the President of the club - Kenneth Stenke - who had previously been removed as a member of the Pinellas County Democratic Executive Committee - offered to resign and allow his vice-president to take over but did not tell the PCDEC executive committee. When she was quoted in the local daily newspaper (St. Petersburg Times) as supporting Ken 100%, the decision to revoke the club charter had already been made and delivered. The Chairman of the Pinellas County Democratic Executive Committee, Mr. Kevin J. Jensen, under his authority as Party Chairman unilaterally withdrew the Charter of the St. Petersburg Democratic Club by speaking directly to Mr Stenke one day after the story broke nationally. The State Democratic Party and Pinellas County Executive unanimously agreed with his decision. The Club dug in its heels, organizing itself under the corporate protection of the State of Florida, and continued to operate as an independent organization supporting Democratic candidates. In 2007, Mr.Stenke passed on and Jim Donelon was elected President. A vote of the membership was taken in late 2007 and it was agreed to re-apply for the Charter from the Florida Democratic Party which required the support of the Chair of the Pinellas County Democratic Executive Committee, Toni Molenari. After extensive negotiations and a number of delays the Charter was approved and presented to Mr. Donelon by the Chair at a meeting of the St. Petersburg Democratic Club. Donelon, serving the unexpired term of Mr. Stenke, declined to stand for re-election in 2009 and retired from politics.

Knott was a native of Chelsea and was the youngest son of Samuel Knott, a tailor, and his wife, Elizabeth n√©e White, from Dorset. After attending the City of London School he was articled to Wood and Ainslie, architects. He was taught etching by Frank Brangwyn at the Architectural Association and when his articles were finished, joined Sir Aston Webb. Webb was a keen participant in architectural competitions and Knott's etching skill was valued in winning them. He drew the etchings which enabled Webb to win the competition for the Queen Victoria memorial outside Buckingham Palace, also working on the designs of Admiralty Arch and the Victoria and Albert Museum. In 1908 Knott set up his own practice together with E. Stone Collins. The first substantial commission they applied for was for offices for the London County Council. Despite many very well known names entering, Knott won at the age of 29. Designs for the construction were brought to life by the architect and perspectivist Alick Horsnell. His design was altered significantly before construction began, including the familiar semicircular terrace being moved from the land to the river-side of the building. Construction was held up by the First World War, during which Knott worked on designs for Royal Air Force bases, and partially completed in 1922 (except for the northern third). In June 1921 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. After the opening of County Hall, Knott built some notable buildings, including two departmental office blocks at Stormont near Belfast. In 1925 he designed the pavilion at the City of London School's new athletics grounds in Grove Park. The building was a memorial to the alumni of the school who had perished in the First World War, and he donated his services free of charge. He had begun the work on the last part of County Hall in 1928 but it remained uncompleted at his death. In 1919 Knott married Ada (n√©e Brown), widow of Sidney James Longden. They had no children. He died suddenly at his Mortlake home in January 1929, aged 50. A bronze plaque to his memory at County Hall was unveiled by the Chairman of the London County Council in June 1932.

Benalm√°dena is rich in attractive beaches and interesting places like the Colomares Castle, the 33-metre-tall Buddhist Benalm√°dena Stupa, the largest Buddhist stupa in Europe, the Benalm√°dena Marina and the Benalm√°dena Cable Car. Benalm√°dena covers an area of just over 27 km2 that extends from the summits of the Sierra de Mijas to the sea, falling in some places as a cliff. The territory is crossed from east to west on Highway A-7, which connects with the provincial capital and other centres of the Mediterranean coast. With 61,383 inhabitants according to the INE census of 2010, Benalm√°dena is the eighth most populous municipality in the province and the third largest metropolitan area, behind M√°laga and Torremolinos. The population is concentrated in three main centers: Benalm√°dena Pueblo, Arroyo de la Miel and Benalm√°dena Costa, although the high urban growth and demographic tends to unify the three cores. Benalm√°dena has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Benalm√°dena experienced a remarkable development during the period of Muslim domination. Its development was paralyzed after joining the Crown of Castile in 1485 due to various natural disasters and the intensity of the activity of privateers in the area. The paper industry and vineyard cultivation reactivated the local economy during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the early 21st century Benalm√°dena is one of the main tourist destinations on the Costa del Sol, with leisure facilities including an amusement park, two aquariums, a casino, a cable car and one of the largest marinas of Andalusia.  History  Historically the region has been occupied and settled by many cultures dating back to the Bronze Age, including the ancient Phoenicians and Romans, and has also been considerably influenced by the Moorish settlement of the southern Iberian peninsula. Two Almenara towers on the coastline date back to the 15th century, originally built to guard the coast and its population from the frequent incursions of Barbary pirates in the years following the reconquista (reconquest) of the region by Henry IV of Castile. In contemporary times, along with the rest of the Costa del Sol area it has become an important tourist destination. The municipality has been subject to an unprecedented urban expansion in recent years with many new buildings and homes built, sometimes causing environmental degradation. Benalm√°dena has both a traditional Spanish village and a modern, coastal, tourist area. =Etymology= Many authors give theories about the origin of the name of the town, but none has been proven. The first documents which contain references to Benalm√°dena from the 15th century in the context of the struggle to win back the Crown of Castile against the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. The assumption on which most historians agree is the Arabic toponym of Ibn al-ma‚Äô din ‚Äúson of the mines‚Äù for the iron and ochre bed found in the area. Another theory, also related to the Arabic word Bina al-ma‚Äôdin, whose translation would be ‚Äúthe construction or building of the mine‚Äù. There are others theories such as the Arabic for ‚Äúpeople between springs‚Äù, Bena-A La Ena. Another suggestion is that name derives from Bina al-Madina, ‚Äúthe state of the al-Madina‚Äôs family‚Äù; according to historical data they were a rich family of Muslim M√°laga and could have owned the area. It has also been suggested that the name of the municipality referred to a lineage of the Madana, Ben al-Madana. =Before Roman Empire= The first human settlements in the area are from the Upper Palaeolithic, 20,000 years ago according to the finding of some caves located in the area: ‚ÄúCueva del Toro‚Äù, ‚ÄúCueva del Botijo‚Äù and ‚ÄúCueva de la Zorrera‚Äù In the 8th and 7th centuries BC the Phoenicians, were interested of the mining of the zone. the Phoenicians founded several colonies all along the Spanish coast. Romans replaced Phoenicians as traders and started to use the wealth of the Mediterranean. Among the Roman remains are the ruins of Benal-Roma, a salting factory located on the coast, the site of Torremuelle, and enamelware and other items preserved in the Museum of Benalm√°dena. The wine culture had great importance during the period of Roman domination. =Middle Ages= In the following centuries the area became depopulated. People sought refuge within M√°laga's city walls from attacks and looting from the sea. The municipality was included in the Roman province of Baetica. It was later taken by Visigoths and Byzantines. After the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, the area was greatly developed. In the 11th century, the population were concentrated into a walled town and a fortress, both located in \\"Benalm√°dena Pueblo\\". Muslims developed the agriculture and introduced sugar cane, figs, grapes and mulberry (used in the textile industry) from the East. Ibn al-Baitar, one of the most important botanists and pharmacologists of the Middle Ages, was born here in 1197. =Before French revolution= In 1456 the fort and the town were destroyed by Christian armies under the command of King Enrique IV of Castilla. The villagers took refuge in Mijas to rebuild their homes, which were destroyed again in 1485 by King Ferdinand the Catholic in his final conquest. Over the next six years the town was deserted. In 1491 the king ordered Alonso Palmero to colonise the area with thirty old Christians and Palmero as mayor, but an earthquake and the constant pirate attacks made it impossible to inhabit the town. It was in these times that the Arabic name became Castilianized and the town became Benalmaina. =Modern age= One of the 'floating houses' in Puerto Deportivo in Benalm√°dena Chinese junk making trips for tourists in Benalm√°dena In 1784 the Italian F√©lix Solesio purchased the farm ‚ÄúArroyo de la Miel‚Äù to build six paper factories to supply the Royal Factory of Playing Cards of Macharaviaya. The destination for most production was the American market. This would mean the birth of the nucleus of Arroyo de la Miel around the new business and the factories built at what is now ‚ÄúPlaza de Espa√±a‚Äù, containing the ‚ÄúPortal de San Carlos‚Äù (San Carlos gate) with the arms of Solesio and the ‚ÄúLa Tribuna‚Äù building. A monument to the founder of this complex was erected in the square. In the 19th century the city grew through the exploitation of muscatel grapes for the wine production, but the vine plague of phylloxera ruined crops across the province. Epidemics of malaria, typhoid and cholera also undermined the population. The municipality's population boom began in the 1950s with the birth and development of mass tourism on the Spanish coast. Many established hotels, restaurants and businesses opened in this period, such as the Hotel Triton (1961), Tivoli World amusement park (1973), Torrequebrada casino and hotel (1979), Selwo Aquarium, Sea Life Aquarium, Chollocasa, Cable car, Irentinsapain, Hotel Alay. Many more were constructed in the early 21st century.  Geography  La Viborrilla Beach The municipality has three main urban areas: *Benalm√°dena Pueblo, the original village, which lies about three kilometres inland at an elevation of approximately 200 m above mean sea level. Its core consists of a typical white-fronted Andalusian village, although including numerous recent buildings in modern architectural styles. The town of Benalm√°dena also has an archaeological museum with locally derived artefacts dating back to the Bronze Age. *Benalm√°dena Costa, an urban agglomeration on the coast. Here there are discos, hotels, beaches, shopping centers and an extensively-equipped marina.Puerto Deportivo of Benalm√°dena Tourist attractions include SeaLife aquarium and Selwo Marina, a theme park with dolphins, penguins and seals among other species. The Parque Paloma is a more recent addition to the attractions, a landscaped park containing a large lake and animals running wild. *Arroyo de la Miel (Honey Stream), originally a separate village, is in the interior between the other two areas. It has become the main residential area, and is also the most commercially active. Buildings, many of them apartment blocks. are tightly packed. It has attractions such as the Tivoli World amusement park, and a teleferico (cable car) running to the summit of the 769-metre Calamorro mountain, which provides panoramic views of the Sierra Nevada, Gibraltar and, on clear days, the Moroccan coastline. =Climate= The climate is typically Mediterranean, with mild temperatures throughout the year, no frost in the colder months, and an average temperature of . Its privileged climate and location in the southern coastal Europe are two important factors so that the tourism industry is the main economic sector of the municipality. The town has a nudist beach, Playa Nudista Benalnatura. =Flora and fauna= Benalm√°dena is a highly urbanised municipality except for the higher areas of the mountains, with few non-urban areas. In the mountains there are typical Mediterranean species such as the white deadnettle, rock rose, thyme, rosemary and marjoram lily like the turpentine tree, juniper and pine trees like pine, carob tree and wild olive. Fauna includes mountain goat, genet, reptiles of various species, eagles, kestrels and owls. Whales and other marine life have been sighted along the coast.  Main sights  The township of Benalm√°dena has the largest example of a Buddhist stupa in the Western world, Benalm√°dena Stupa, constructed in 2003.

He also wrote the oration for Ludwig van Beethoven's funeral. While writing during the period of Romanticism, Grillparzer's poetic language owes far more to the period of Classicism which reigned during his formative years. Committed to the classical ideals of aesthetic beauty and morality, his plots shy away from the realism which developed during his time, preferring instead to use the theater to address spiritual values, which in the words of the dying queen of his Libussa, would only come after the period of Materialism had passed. Due to the identity-creating use of his works, especially after World War II, he was named as the national poet of Austria. Biography Plaque commemorating Franz Grillparzer acting as director of the Hofkammerarchiv, Johannesgasse 6, 1st district of Vienna Franz Grillparzer was born in Vienna, Austria. His father, the advocate E. J. Grillparzer, was a severe pedant and a staunch upholder of the liberal traditions of the reign of Joseph II. E. J. Grillparzee was an unsuccessful lawyer whose fortunes were ruined by Napoleon's invasion. His mother, Anna Franziska, was a nervous, highly-strung woman, daughter of Christoph Sonnleithner, sister to Joseph and Ignaz, aunt to Leopold. Franz's father wished him to become a lawyer, and he entered the University of Vienna in 1807 as a student of jurisprudence. Two years later his father died, leaving the family in difficult circumstances. After obtaining his degree from the university in 1811, Franz became a private tutor for a noble family; then in 1813, he entered the civil service as a clerk at the Imperial and Royal Hofkammer (Exchequer) in Austria. In 1821, he unsuccessfully applied to the position of scribe at the Imperial Library, and later that same year, he was relocated to the Ministry of Finance. In 1832, he became director of the archives at the Imperial Hofkammer, a position he held until his retirement in 1856. Grillparzer had little capacity for an official career and regarded his position merely as a means of independence. From early youth, Grillparzer displayed a strong literary impulse. He devoted especial attention to the Spanish drama, and many of his works show the influence of Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca. In 1853, he wrote an autobiography of his life and times from birth to 1836. Among his posthumous writings are many fragments of literary, philosophic, and political criticism, all of them indicating a strong and independent spirit, not invariably just, but distinct, penetrating, and suggestive. It is characteristic of him that he expresses extreme dislike of Hegel's philosophy on the ground that its terms are unintelligible. On the other hand, he gives evidence of careful and sympathetic study of Immanuel Kant. Of modern literary critics, Gervinus was most repugnant to him, mainly because of the tendency of this writer to attribute moral aims to authors who created solely for art's sake. He rather maliciously says that Gervinus had one advantage and one disadvantage in writing his history of German literature ‚Äì the advantage of common sense, the disadvantage of knowing nothing of his subject. Of a quiet contemplative nature, Grillparzer shunned general society. He never married. He could seem cold and distant to strangers, but in conversation with people he liked, his real disposition revealed itself; his manner became animated, his eyes brightened, and a sarcastic but not ill- natured smile would play upon his lips. He often said that the art of writing poetry can neither be taught nor learned, but he also held that inspiration will not visit a poet who neglects to make himself master of his subject. Hence before writing a play he worked hard, striving to comprehend the spirit of the age he wished to represent. He was exceedingly fond of travel, and at different times visited all the leading European countries. After 1840, when his only comedy was rejected by the public, he almost passed from the memory of his contemporaries. Fortunately for him, his admirer Heinrich Laube became artistic director of Vienna's court theater in 1849. Laube staged productions of Grillparzer's forgotten works, and their success was immediate and profound. To his own surprise, Grillparzer became the most popular author of the day; he was ranked with Goethe and Schiller, and lauded as the national poet of Austria. On his eightieth birthday, all classes from the court downwards united to do him honour; never, probably, did Vienna exert herself so much to prove her respect for a private citizen. He was buried with an amount of ceremony that surpassed even the pomp displayed at Klopstock's funeral. He was originally buried in the W√§hringer Cemetery in Vienna, now known as Schubertpark. He now lies at Hietzing Cemetery. Early works up to Das goldene Vlies Franz Grillparzer, photography by Ludwig Angerer From 1807 to 1809, Grillparzer wrote a long tragedy in iambics, Blanca von Castilien, modeled on Schiller's Don Carlos. He also produced the dramatic fragments Spartacus and Alfred der Grosse (1809). When Grillparzer began to write, the German stage was dominated by the wild plays of Zacharias Werner, Adolf M√ºllner, and other authors of so-called \\"fate-tragedies.\\" Grillparzer's play The Ancestress (), published in 1816, reflected this trend. It is a gruesome fate-tragedy in the trochaic measure of the Spanish drama, already made popular by M√ºllner's Schuld. The ghost of a lady who was killed by her husband for infidelity is doomed to walk the earth until her family line dies out, and this happens in the play amid scenes of violence and horror. Its general character is similar to that of Werner's dramas; it only differs from them in containing individual passages of much force and beauty. It reveals an instinct for dramatic as opposed to merely theatrical effect, which distinguishes it from other fate-dramas of the day. Its success led to the poet being classed for the best part of his life with playwrights like M√ºllner and Christoph Ernst von Houwald. In 1817, the first performances of The Ancestress made Grillparzer famous. Grillparzer followed this gothic drama with Sappho (1818), a drama of a very different type. Similar to Goethe's Torquato Tasso, Grillparzer dramatized the tragedy of poetic genius, showing how a poet must renounce earthly happiness to fulfill a higher mission. After reading an Italian translation of this play, Lord Byron expressed his conviction that Grillparzer would be held in reverence by posterity. Grillparzer's conceptions are not so clearly defined as Goethe's, nor is his diction so varied and harmonious; but the play has the stamp of genius, and ranks as one of the best works that attempt to combine the passion and sentiment of modern life with the simplicity and grace of ancient masterpieces. In 1821, Grillparzer completed his ' trilogy, a project that had been interrupted in 1819 when his depressed mother committed suicide, and by Grillparzer's subsequent visit to Italy. The trilogy opens with a one-act prelude, Der Gastfreund, then depicts, in The Argonauts (Die Argonauten) Jason's adventures in his quest for the Fleece. Medea, a tragedy of classic proportions, contains the culminating events of the story of Medea, which had been so often dramatized before. Similarly to Sappho but on a larger scale, this trilogy is a tragedy of the heart's desire, the conflict of the simple happy life with that sinister power, be it genius or ambition, which upsets the equilibrium of life. There is delicate art in the delineation of the mingled fascination and repulsion which Medea and Jason feel for each other, and when at last repulsion becomes the dominant force, Grillparzer gives splendid utterance to Medea's rage. At the end, Medea bears the fatal Fleece back to Delphi, while Jason is left to realize the futility of human striving and earthly happiness. The end is bitter disillusionment; the only consolation renunciation. Some critics consider Medea Grillparzer's highest achievement. Historical tragedies For his historical tragedy King Ottokar's Fortune and End (, written 1823, but owing to difficulties with the censor, not performed until February 19, 1825), Grillparzer dramatized the conflict of Ottokar II of Bohemia with Rudolph I of Germany. It appealed strongly to the patriotic sympathies of the Viennese, because it depicted one of the proudest periods of Austrian history, the founding of the House of Habsburg. With an almost modern realism Grillparzer reproduced the medieval era, at the same time not losing sight of the needs of the theatre. It cannot be said that the materials of the play are welded into a compact whole, but the characters are vigorously conceived, and there is a fine dramatic contrast between the brilliant, restless, and unscrupulous Ottokar and the calm, upright, and ultimately triumphant Rudolph. Because Ottokar is defeated, critics argue that this play represents another work in which Grillparzer preaches the futility of endeavour and the vanity of worldly greatness. A second historical tragedy, A faithful Servant of his Lord ('), 1826, performed 1828), attempted to illustrate a more heroic theme; but the subject of the superhuman self- effacement of Bancbanus before his lord Duke Otto of Meran proved too uncompromising an illustration of Kant's categorical imperative of duty to be palatable in the theatre. Liberal critics accused Grillparzer of promoting servility. At the same time, the play displeased the court, and its presentation was stopped. It hardly deserved to be made the subject of so much contention, for it is one of the least powerful of Grillparzer's later dramas. With these historical tragedies began the darkest decade of Grillparzer's life. They brought him into conflict with the Austrian censor ‚Äì a conflict that grated on Grillparzer's sensitive soul, and was aggravated by his own position as a servant of the state. In 1826, he paid a visit to Goethe in Saxe-Weimar, and was able to compare the enlightened conditions of Weimar with the censorship of Vienna. To these troubles were added personal worries. In the winter of 1820/1821, Grillparzer had met and fallen in love with Katharina Fr√∂hlich (1801‚Äì1879), but whether owing to a presentiment of mutual incompatibility, or merely owing to Grillparzer's conviction that life had no happiness in store for him, he shrank from marriage. Nevertheless, he was plunged into an abyss of misery and despair to which his diary bears heart- rending witness; his sufferings found poetic expression in the cycle of poems called Tristia ex Ponto (1835). More masterpieces and a setback Still, during this time, Grillparzer completed two of his greatest dramas, Waves of the Sea and of Love (, 1831) and The Dream, a Life (, 1834). Waves of the Sea and of Love dramatizes the story of Hero and Leander, as a poetic love-tragedy with an insight into character motivation that predates the psychological dramas of Ibsen. The work again is formed on classic models, but in this instance his feeling is so distinctly modern that it does not find adequate expression in Grillparzer's carefully measured verse. The subject has never been more happily treated than in some passages, which, however, are marked rather by lyrical than dramatic qualities.This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: The poetic influence of Lope de Vega and Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca is also evident. The Dream, a Life, Grillparzer's technical masterpiece, is in form perhaps even influenced by Spanish drama; it is also more of what Goethe called a confession. The aspirations of Rustan, an ambitious young peasant, are reflected in the hero's dream, which takes up nearly three acts of the play. Ultimately Rustan awakens from his nightmare to realize the truth of Grillparzer's own pessimistic belief that all earthly ambitions and aspirations are vanity; the only true happiness is contentment with one's lot and inner peace. It was the first of Grillparzer's dramas that did not end tragically. Grillparzer provided the text for Schubert's 'Mirjams Siegesgesang' (Miriam's Song of Triumph), Op. 136/D. 942. In 1838 Grillparzer produced his only comedy, Woe to him who lies (). But Woe to him who lies, in spite of its humour of situation, its sparkling dialogue and its original premise ‚Äî a hero who wins by invariably telling the truth, where his enemies invariably expect him to lie ‚Äì was too strange to meet with approval in its day. Its premiere on 6 March 1838 was a failure. This was a severe blow to the poet, who turned his back forever on the German theatre. Later life and final masterpieces Franz Grillparzer's tomb In 1836, Grillparzer paid a visit to Paris and London, in 1843 to Athens and Constantinople. Then came the Revolution which struck off the intellectual fetters under which Grillparzer and his contemporaries had groaned in Austria, but the liberation came too late for him. Honours were heaped upon him; he was made a member of the Academy of Sciences; Heinrich Laube, as director of the Burgtheater, reinstated his plays into the repertory; in 1861, he was elected to the Austrian Herrenhaus; his eightieth birthday was a national festival, and when he died in Vienna, on 21 January 1872, the mourning of the Austrian people was universal. With the exception of a beautiful fragment, Esther (1861), Grillparzer published no more dramatic poetry after the fiasco of Weh dem, der l√ºgt, but at his death three completed tragedies were found among his papers. Of these, The Jewess of Toledo (Die J√ºdin von Toledo, written in 1851), an admirable adaptation from the Spanish, has won a permanent place in the German classical repertory; Ein Bruderzwist in Habsburg is a powerful historical tragedy and Libussa is perhaps the most mature, as it is certainly the deepest, of all Grillparzer's dramas; the latter two plays prove how much was lost by the poet's divorce from the theatre. Assessment Grillparzer was an important figure in the Viennese theater of the 1840s when his greatest dramatic works were produced. Together with Hebbel, he rates as the most influential dramatist of the mid-nineteenth century. While most of his best plays originate in the age of Romanticism, his works could not be classified as Romantic. His language and characters reflect the earlier sensibilities of neo-classicism, exhibited in plays like Sappho and Das goldene Vlies which treats the subject matter of Jason bringing Medea back to Greece. In these plays he deals with classical themes as well as subject matter. One important characteristic of the age is that aesthetic beauty and virtue are seen as inter-related. In his historical plays like K√∂nig Ottokars Gl√ºck und Ende, he expresses the Enlightenment optimism that humankind can put its affairs in order and realize an age of peace an harmony. This is a common theme in Austrian thought from this period. Some have suggested that this is a reflection of their multi-ethnic Austrian state. Ottkar, the thirteenth century Bohemian King, wants to subjugate his neighbors, a thinly veiled reference to the recently defeated Napoleon. However, the play ends on an upbeat note. Although Grillparzer was essentially a dramatist, his lyric poetry is in the intensity of its personal note hardly inferior to Lenau's; and the bitterness of his later years found vent in biting and stinging epigrams that spared few of his greater contemporaries. As a prose writer, he has left one powerful short story, Der arme Spielmann (1848), and a volume of critical studies on the Spanish drama, which shows how completely he had succeeded in identifying himself with the Spanish point of view. Grillparzer's brooding, unbalanced temperament, his lack of will-power, his pessimistic renunciation and the bitterness which his self-imposed martyrdom produced in him, made him peculiarly adapted to express the mood of Austria in the epoch of intellectual thraldom that lay between the Napoleonic wars and the Revolution of 1848. Legacy and cultural references *He is honoured in Austria with a pastry, the Grillparzer Torte. *Outside Austria, the modern American reader is perhaps most familiar with Grillparzer via disparaging references to him in the popular John Irving novel The World According to Garp. The book features a story within a story entitled The Pension Grillparzer. Grillparzer is also referenced in Irving's novel A Son of the Circus, in which the protagonist had studied in Vienna. *He is mentioned in the W. G. Sebald novel Vertigo. *In the tenth of the German language film series, Die Zweite Heimat by Edgar Reitz, Reinhard and Esther read from a Grillparzer poem comparing the half moon to an incomplete, ambiguous life. *In Vienna's Inner City , Grillparzerstrasse was named after him in 1873 . There is also a Grillparzerstra√üe in several other cities, including Graz, Linz, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Berlin, Dresden, Freiburg / Br., Hamburg, Mannheim and Munich. Double designations in Vienna resulting from incorporations were withdrawn. *After his death, a monument was erected in the Volksgarten in Vienna; also by Leopold Schr√∂dl in Baden. *His portrait adorned the 100 Schilling banknote from 1954. The Mint Austria minted a 25 Schilling commemorative coin (bust picture) in 1964 and a 20 Schilling course coin (bust picture and Burgtheater ) in 1991 . *The Austrian Post issued four occasions (1931, 1947, 1972 and 1991) special stamps with portraits of the writer. *The Grillparzer Prize and the Grillparzer Ring were named after him. *The asteroid 30933 was named Grillparzer in his honor. *In Linz and in St. P√∂lten, elementary schools are named after him.

COREPER, from French Comit√© des repr√©sentants permanents, is the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union, made up of the head or deputy head of mission from the EU member states in Brussels. Its defined role is to prepare the agenda for the ministerial Council of the European Union meetings; it may also take some procedural decisions. It oversees and coordinates the work of some 250 committees and working parties made up of civil servants from the member states who work on issues at the technical level to be discussed later by COREPER and the Council. It is chaired by the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. There are in fact two committees: *COREPER I consists of deputy heads of mission and deals largely with social and economic issues; *COREPER II consists of heads of mission (Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary) and deals largely with political, financial and foreign policy issues. Representatives of the Council Secretariat from the relevant Directorates and from the Legal Directorate are also present. Weekly meetings are held in private; the agenda of the meeting is divided into * a part \\"I\\" (I points, items scheduled without debate) and * a part \\"II\\" (II points, items scheduled for debate). They divide the ministerial agenda into three categories: *I points which are for information and no ministerial decision is needed; *A points where the decision can be made without debate (but it has to be put off the agenda of this meeting if any national delegation opposes it being decided) and is often on a subject outside the detailed responsibility of the particular group of ministers; *B points where debate is needed and the decision may not be known in advance. An item may be described internally as a false B point - this is to give the public impression as a B point that ministers are actively debating it because of its importance when in fact it could have been treated as an A point because negotiation and compromise has already taken place in COREPER. Relatively few decisions are taken by ministers on true B points: they are usually sent back to COREPER until they can be returned as an A point or a false B point. The deliberations and decisions of the Council itself under the co-decision procedure are, unlike all other Council meetings, including COREPER and Council working group meetings, public. Article 240 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union lays down the legal basis of COREPER.

He is notable for his 1920 book The Animate and the Inanimate, in which he speculates about the origin of life in the context of thermodynamics. Sidis was raised in a particular manner by his father, psychiatrist Boris Sidis, who wished his son to be gifted. Sidis first became famous for his precocity and later for his eccentricity and withdrawal from public life. Eventually, he avoided mathematics altogether, writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms. He entered Harvard at age 11 and, as an adult, was claimed to have an extremely high IQ, and to be conversant in about 25 languages and dialects. Some of these claims have not been verified, but many of his contemporaries, including Norbert Wiener, Daniel Frost Comstock and William James, supported the assertion that he was extremely intelligent. Biography =Parents and upbringing (1898‚Äì1908)= William James Sidis was born to Jewish emigrants from Ukraine, on April 1, 1898, in New York City. His father, Boris Sidis, PhD, M.D., had emigrated in 1887 to escape political and anti-semitic persecution. His mother, Sarah (Mandelbaum) Sidis, M.D., and her family had fled the pogroms in the late 1880s. Sarah attended Boston University and graduated from its School of Medicine in 1897. William was named after his godfather, Boris' friend and colleague, the American philosopher William James. Boris was a psychiatrist and published numerous books and articles, performing pioneering work in abnormal psychology. He was a polyglot, and his son William would become one at a young age. Sidis's parents believed in nurturing a precocious and fearless love of knowledge (but their methods of parenting were criticized in the media and retrospectively). Sidis could read The New York Times at 18 months. By age eight, he had reportedly taught himself eight languages (Latin, Greek, French, Russian, German, Hebrew, Turkish, and Armenian) and invented another, which he called \\"Vendergood\\". =Harvard University and college life (1909‚Äì1915)= Although the University had previously refused to let his father enroll him at age 9 because he was still a child, Sidis set a record in 1909 by becoming the youngest person to enroll at Harvard University. In early 1910, Sidis' mastery of higher mathematics was such that he lectured the Harvard Mathematical Club on four- dimensional bodies which brought him nationwide attention. Notable child prodigy, cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener, who also attended Harvard at the time and knew Sidis later stated in his book Ex-Prodigy: \\"The talk would have done credit to a first or second-year graduate student of any age...talk represented the triumph of the unaided efforts of a very brilliant child.\\" MIT physics professor Daniel F. Comstock was full of praises: \\"Karl Friedrich Gauss is the only example in history, of all prodigies, whom Sidis resembles. I predict that young Sidis will be a great astronomical mathematician. He will evolve new theories and invent new ways of calculating astronomical phenomena. I believe he will be a great mathematician, the leader in that science in the future.\\" Sidis began taking a full-time course load in 1910 and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, on June 18, 1914, at age 16. Shortly after graduation, he told reporters that he wanted to live the perfect life, which to him meant living in seclusion. He granted an interview to a reporter from the Boston Herald. The paper reported Sidis's vows to remain celibate and never to marry, as he said women did not appeal to him. Later he developed a strong affection for Martha Foley, one year older than him. He later enrolled at Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. According to The Prodigy: a Biography of William James Sidis, he briefly served at the League of Nations before leaving because U.S. president Woodrow Wilson would not withdraw troops deployed during the Great War. He was outspoken about his pacifism. =Teaching and further education (1915‚Äì1919)= After a group of Harvard students threatened Sidis physically, his parents secured him a job at the William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art (now Rice University) in Houston, Texas, as a mathematics teaching assistant. He arrived at Rice in December 1915 at the age of 17. He was a graduate fellow working toward his doctorate. Sidis taught three classes: Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, and freshman math (he wrote a textbook for the Euclidean geometry course in Greek). After less than a year, frustrated with the department, his teaching requirements, and his treatment by students older than himself, Sidis left his post and returned to New England. When a friend later asked him why he had left, he replied, \\"I never knew why they gave me the job in the first place‚ÄîI'm not much of a teacher. I didn't leave: I was asked to go.\\" Sidis abandoned his pursuit of a graduate degree in mathematics and enrolled at the Harvard Law School in September 1916, but withdrew in good standing in his final year in March 1919. =Politics and arrest (1919‚Äì1921)= In 1919, shortly after his withdrawal from law school, Sidis was arrested for participating in a socialist May Day parade in Boston that turned violent. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison under the Sedition Act of 1918 by Roxbury Municipal Court Judge Albert F Hayden. Sidis' arrest featured prominently in newspapers, as his early graduation from Harvard had garnered considerable local celebrity status. During the trial, Sidis stated that he had been a conscientious objector to the World War I draft, was a socialist, and did not believe in a god like the \\"big boss of the Christians,\\" but rather in something that is in a way apart from a human being. He later developed his own libertarian philosophy based on individual rights and \\"the American social continuity\\". His father arranged with the district attorney to keep Sidis out of prison before his appeal came to trial; his parents, instead, held him in their sanatorium in New Hampshire for a year. They took him to California, where he spent another year. While at the sanatorium, his parents set about \\"reforming\\" him and threatened him with transfer to an insane asylum. =Later life (1921‚Äì1944)= After returning to the East Coast in 1921, Sidis was determined to live an independent and private life. He only took work running adding machines or other fairly menial tasks. He worked in New York City and became estranged from his parents. It took years before he was cleared legally to return to Massachusetts, and he was concerned about his risk of arrest for years. He obsessively collected streetcar transfers, wrote self-published periodicals, and taught small circles of interested friends his version of American history. In 1933, Sidis passed a Civil Service exam in New York, but scored a low ranking of 254. In a private letter, Sidis wrote that this was \\"not so encouraging\\". In 1935, he wrote an unpublished manuscript, The Tribes and the States, which traces Native American contributions to American democracy. In 1944, Sidis won a settlement from The New Yorker for an article published in 1937. He had alleged it contained many false statements. Under the title \\"Where Are They Now?\\", James Thurber pseudonymously described Sidis's life as lonely, in a \\"hall bedroom in Boston's shabby South End\\". Lower courts had dismissed Sidis as a public figure with no right to challenge personal publicity. He lost an appeal of an invasion of privacy lawsuit at the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1940 over the same article. Judge Charles Edward Clark expressed sympathy for Sidis, who claimed that the publication had exposed him to \\"public scorn, ridicule, and contempt\\" and caused him \\"grievous mental anguish [and] humiliation,\\" but found that the court was not disposed to \\"afford to all the intimate details of private life an absolute immunity from the prying of the press\\". Sidis died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1944 in Boston at age 46. His father had died from the same malady in 1923 at age 56. Publications and subjects of research From writings on cosmology, to writings on Native American history, to Notes on the Collection of Transfers, and several purported lost texts on anthropology, philology, and transportation systems, Sidis covered a broad range of subjects. Some of his ideas concerned cosmological reversibility and \\"social continuity\\". In The Animate and the Inanimate (1925), Sidis predicted the existence of regions of space where the second law of thermodynamics operated in reverse to the temporal direction that we experience in our local area. Everything outside of what we would today call a galaxy would be such a region. Sidis claimed that the matter in this region would not generate light. Sidis's The Tribes and the States (c. 1935) employs the pseudonym \\"John W. Shattuck\\", purporting to give a 100,000-year history of the Settlement of the Americas, from prehistoric times to 1828. In this text, he suggests that \\"there were red men at one time in Europe as well as in America\\". Sidis was also a \\"peridromophile\\", a term he coined for people fascinated with transportation research and streetcar systems. He wrote a treatise on streetcar transfers under the pseudonym of \\"Frank Folupa\\" that identified means of increasing public transport usage. In 1930, Sidis received a patent for a rotary perpetual calendar that took into account leap years. =The Animate and the Inanimate= Sidis wrote The Animate and the Inanimate to detail his thoughts on the origins of life, cosmology, and the potential reversibility of the second law through Maxwell's Demon, among other things. It was published in 1925; however, it has been suggested that Sidis was working on the theory as early as 1916. One motivation for writing this theory appears to be to explain psychologist and philosopher William James's \\"reserve energy\\" theory which claimed that there was \\"reserve energy\\" that could be used by people when put under extreme conditions, Sidis' own \\"forced prodigy\\" upbringing being a result of testing said theory. The work is one of the few works that Sidis did not write under a pseudonym. In The Animate and the Inanimate, Sidis states that the universe is infinite, as well as it containing sections of \\"negative tendencies\\" where various laws of physics were reversed that are juxtaposed with \\"positive tendencies\\", which switch over epochs of time. Sidis states that there was not an \\"origin of life\\", but that life has always existed and that it has only changed through evolution. Sidis also adopts Eduard Pfl√ºger's cyanogen based life theory, and Sidis cites \\"organic\\" things such as almonds (his example) that have cyanogen that doesn't kill, as cyanogen (and derivatives thereof) is normally a highly toxic substance thus making this a strange anomaly. Sidis describes his theory as a fusion of the mechanistic model of life and the vitalist model of life, as well as entertaining the notion of life coming to earth from asteroids (as advanced by Lord Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz). Sidis also states that functionally speaking, stars are \\"alive\\" and undergo an eternally repeating light-dark cycle, reversing the second law in the dark portion of the cycle. For all intents and purposes, Sidis' theory at the time of its release was ignored, only to be found in an attic in 1979. Upon this discovery, Buckminster Fuller (who was a classmate of William James Sidis) said the following in regards to The Animate and the Inanimate: =Vendergood language= Sidis created a constructed language called Vendergood in his second book, the Book of Vendergood, which he wrote at the age of 8. The language was mostly based on Latin and Greek, but also drew on German and French and other Romance languages. It distinguished between eight moods: indicative, potential, imperative absolute, subjunctive, imperative, infinitive, optative, and Sidis's own strongeable. One of its chapters is titled \\"Imperfect and Future Indicative Active\\". Other parts explain the origin of Roman numerals. It uses base 12 instead of base 10: * eis ‚Äì one * duet ‚Äì two * tre ‚Äì three * guar ‚Äì four * quin ‚Äì five * sex ‚Äì six * sep ‚Äì seven * oo(oe?) ‚Äì eight * non ‚Äì nine * ecem ‚Äì ten * elevenos ‚Äì eleven * dec ‚Äì twelve * eidec (eis, dec) ‚Äì thirteen Most of the examples are presented in the form of tests: # Do I love the young man? = Amevo (-)ne the neania? # The bowman obscures. = The toxoteis obscurit. # I am learning Vendergood. = (Euni) disceuo Vendergood. # What do you learn? (sing.). = Quen diseois-nar? # I obscure ten farmers. = Obscureuo ecem agrieolai. =The Tribes and the States= The Tribes and the States outlines the history of the Native Americans, focusing mostly on the Northeastern tribes and continuing up to the mid-19th century. It was written around 1935 but was never published for lack of completion at the time of Sidis' death. Sidis wrote the history under the pseudonym \\"John W. Shattuck\\". Much of the history was taken from wampum belts; Sidis explained, \\"The weaving of wampum belts is a sort of writing by means of belts of colored beads, in which the various designs of beads denoted different ideas according to a definitely accepted system, which could be read by anyone acquainted with wampum language, irrespective of what the spoken language is. Records and treaties are kept in this manner, and individuals could write letters to one another in this way.\\"William James Sidis, 'The Tribes And The States: 100,000-Year History of North America' (via sidis.net) Much of the subject matter of the book is centered on the influence of Native Americans on migrating Europeans and the effect of Native Americans on the formation of the United States. It describes the origination of the federations that were to be an important event to the Founding Fathers. Legacy After his death, Helena Sidis claimed that her brother had an IQ reported in Abraham Sperling's 1946 book Psychology for the Millions as \\"the very highest that had ever been obtained\\", but later authors found that some of his biographers, such as Amy Wallace, exaggerated how high his IQ actually was and exactly what Sperling had claimed. Sperling actually wrote: It has been acknowledged that Helena and William's mother Sarah had developed a reputation of exaggerated claims about the Sidis family. Helena had also falsely claimed that the Civil Service exam William took in 1933 was an IQ test and that his ranking of 254 was instead an IQ score of 254. It is speculated that the number \\"254\\" was actually William's placement on the list after he passed the Civil Service exam, as he stated in a letter sent to his family. Helena also claimed that \\"Billy knew all the languages in the world, while my father only knew 27. I wonder if there were any Billy didn't know.\\" This claim was not backed by any other source outside the Sidis family, and Sarah Sidis also made an improbable claim in her 1950 book The Sidis Story that William could learn a language in just one day. Boris Sidis had once dismissed tests of intelligence as \\"silly, pedantic, absurd, and grossly misleading\\". Regardless of the exaggerations, Sidis was judged by contemporaries such as MIT Physics professor Daniel Frost Comstock and American mathematician Norbert Wiener (who wrote about Sidis in his autobiography) to have had real ability. Sidis' life and work, particularly his ideas about Native Americans, are extensively discussed in Robert M. Pirsig's book Lila: An Inquiry into Morals (1991). Sidis is also discussed in Ex-Prodigy, an autobiography by mathematician Norbert Wiener (1894‚Äì1964), who was a prodigy himself. The Danish author wrote a novel as a fictional account based on Sidis' life; The Perfect Life of William Sidis was published in Denmark in 2011. Another novel based on his biography was published by the German author in 2017. =In education discussions= The debate about Sidis' manner of upbringing occurred within a larger discourse about the best way to educate children. Newspapers criticized Boris Sidis' child-rearing methods. Most educators of the day believed that schools should expose children to common experiences to create good citizens. Most psychologists thought intelligence was hereditary, a position that precluded early childhood education at home. The difficulties Sidis encountered in dealing with the social structure of a collegiate setting may have shaped opinion against allowing such children to rapidly advance through higher education in his day. Research indicates that a challenging curriculum can relieve social and emotional difficulties commonly experienced by gifted children. Embracing these findings, several colleges now have procedures for early entrance. The Davidson Institute for Talent Development has developed a guidebook on the topic. Sidis was portrayed derisively in the press of the day. The New York Times, for example, described him as \\"a wonderfully successful result of a scientific forcing experiment\\". His mother later maintained that newspaper accounts of her son bore little resemblance to him.

The game was released in Japanese arcades in 1999 and was ported to the Sega Dreamcast in 2001 by Smilebit. A Microsoft Windows version was released in 2000 and a PlayStation 2 port followed in 2004. The Typing of the Dead is a modification of Sega's 1998 light gun arcade game The House of the Dead 2 in which the gun is replaced by a computer keyboard. The player takes the role of a secret agent in a zombie-infested Venice and must quickly type letters, words and phrases in order to kill fast-advancing enemies. Despite falling under the criteria of \\"edutainment\\", the game was lauded by mainstream game critics for its humor, difficulty and originality. The PC version of The Typing of the Dead sold 120,000 units in 2003. A PlayStation 2 port was called The Typing of the Dead: Zombie Panic. This version was released in Japan in late December 2004 and was packaged with a USB keyboard. The game was mostly unchanged, although the Dreamcast backpacks were replaced with PlayStation 2 backpacks and new minigames were incorporated into the main story. A sequel, The Typing of the Dead 2, was released in Japan in 2007. English of the Dead, another revision of House of the Dead 2, was released as a language-learning game for the Nintendo DS in Japan in 2008. In 2012, an iOS remake was released entitled Flick of the Dead. Typing of the Dead: Overkill, based on The House of the Dead: Overkill, was released on Windows in October 2013.  Gameplay  A screen in which the player must type the names of flowers to kill zombies The Typing of the Dead has been described variously as a remake or as a mod of the original The House of the Dead 2. It retains the original's first-person rail shooter style, but instead of shooting zombies and other enemies the player must type out words or phrases to kill them. The required word, sentence or phrase is displayed in a box that appears with the enemy. The phrases' length and complexity increase as the game progresses. Other features retained include the rescue challenges that alter the path the game takes to its final destination and the secrets and bonus items hidden throughout the game. All levels contain specific challenge areas in which the player is required to kill a certain number of zombies in a limited time. These end with a boss battle that uses some altered form of usual gameplay, such as a long phrase or a question whose answer must be correctly typed. The console ports have \\"Original\\" and \\"Arcade\\" modes for the main storyline and \\"Tutorial,\\" \\"Drill,\\" and \\"Boss\\" modes for additional typing training. Most other changes are superficial, such as replacement of the weapons wielded by zombies with harmless items and equipping the AMS agents with keyboards attached to backpack Sega Dreamcasts with oversized batteries.  Plot  The plot of the game closely follows that of House of the Dead 2. The story begins on February 26, 2000, when several AMS agents have been dispatched to investigate a zombie outbreak in Venice, Italy. The player can control two characters, James and Gary, who are sent to find the original game's \\"G\\" and then tasked with restoring order. Responsibility for the outbreaks is soon traced to \\"Goldman,\\" a banking tycoon and scientist who attempts to end human control of the earth. Much of the game revolves around destroying Goldman's creations, concluding with the final boss of \\"the Emperor.\\" One of three possible humorous ending sequences occurs, depending on the answers given to the questions asked to defeat the Emperor. = Endings = There are three possible endings: * Explosion ending: The character defeats the Emperor, then sees Goldman committing suicide by falling off the building. An explosion is seen as Goldman hits the ground. This ending is achieved by typing honest answers to questions asked in the boss fight. * Bungee ending: This is similar to the first, but a bungee cord can be seen attached to Goldman's leg. Goldman returns to where he was and belches. This ending is achieved by typing a combination of honest and untruthful or strange answers to questions asked in the boss fight. * Superman ending: This is similar to the first, but as Goldman bids farewell to the narrator, he raises his hands and rises into the sky. This ending is achieved by typing untruthful answers to questions asked in the boss fight.  Releases  An original arcade cabinet of the game The Typing of the Dead was originally released for arcades in Japan in 1999 with a special cabinet equipped with dual QWERTY keyboards. The game was one of the first developments by Smilebit, a team of Sega developers that had recently spun off as a new company. The first home console release was for the Japanese Sega Dreamcast market on March 30, 2000. The North American release took place the following January. A PC port was produced by Empire Interactive and released in September 2001. A second PC release, Typing of the Dead 2003, featuring support for higher resolution and a \\"Kid's mode\\" featuring a new character with Japanese voice acting, was released in Japan only; several other Japanese-exclusive PC versions followed. The original PC version was made available on GameTap in October 2007.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed The Typing of the Dead on their March 15, 2000 issue as being the fourth most-successful dedicated arcade game of the year. The Typing of the Dead was regarded overall by critics as an enjoyable game, receiving \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the Dreamcast version a score of 35 out of 40. Reviewers appreciated the absurdist humor of the game's format, especially in the unusual phrases the game generates during later levels. The sub-par voice acting of the original House of the Dead 2 was considered to enhance this aspect of the game. The quality of the graphics was criticized to varying degrees, as they had not been updated from the original House of the Dead 2 arcade version. PC World was so unimpressed with the game's premise that they listed it as a runner up on a \\"Top Ten Worst Games\\" list. Game Informer has named the game the weirdest of all time.

He was frequently referred to as \\"Monk\\" Lewis, because of the success of his 1796 Gothic novel The Monk. He also worked as a diplomat, politician and an estate owner in Jamaica. Biography =Family= Lewis was the first-born child of Matthew and Frances Maria Sewell Lewis. His father, Matthew Lewis, was the son of William Lewis and Jane Gregory and was born in England in 1750. He attended Westminster School before proceeding to Christ Church, Oxford, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1769 and his master's in 1772. During his time at Westminster, Lewis's parents separated, and he idolised his mother without disregarding his father. Mrs Lewis moved to France in this period; while there, she was in continuous correspondence with Matthew. The correspondence between Matthew and his mother consisted of discussion regarding the poor state of his mother's welfare and estate. That same year, Lewis was appointed Chief Clerk in the War Office. The following year, he married Frances Maria Sewell, a young woman who was very popular at court. She was the third daughter of the senior judge Sir Thomas Sewell and was one of eight children born in his first marriage to Catherine Heath. Her family, like Lewis's, had connections with Jamaica. As a child, she spent her time in Ottershaw. In December 1775, in addition to his War Office post, Lewis became the Deputy Secretary at War. With one exception, he was the first to hold both positions and receive both salaries contemporaneously. Lewis owned considerable property in Jamaica, within four miles of Savanna-la-Mer, or Savanna-la-Mar, which was hit by a devastating earthquake and hurricane in 1779. His son would later inherit this property.Louis F. Peck A Life of Matthew G. Lewis. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard UP, 1961. Hathi Trust Digital Library. Retrieved on 19 March 2010. In addition to Matthew Gregory Lewis, Matthew and Frances had three other children: Maria, Barrington, and Sophia Elizabeth. On 23 July 1781, when Matthew was six and his youngest sister one- and-a-half years old, Frances left her husband, taking the music master, Samuel Harrison, as her lover. During their estrangement, Frances lived under a different name, Langley, in order to hide her location from her husband, although he still learned of whereabouts. On 3 July 1782, Frances gave birth to a child. That same day, hearing of the birth, her estranged husband returned. Afterwards, he began to arrange a legal separation from his wife. After formally accusing his wife of adultery through the Consistory Court of the Bishop of London on 27 February 1783, he petitioned the House of Lords for permission to bring about a bill of divorce. However, as these bills were rarely granted, it was rejected when brought to a vote. Consequently, Matthew and Frances remained married until his death in 1818. Frances, though withdrawing from society and temporarily moving to France, was always supported financially by her husband and then later, her son. She later returned to London and then finished her life at Leatherhead, rejoining society and even becoming a lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Wales.Lewis, Matthew G. The Monk: A Romance. Ed.

His rudeness to such women brought him to the perpetual verge of disinheritance, a threat commonly held over his head and sometimes acted on throughout his lifetime. Margaret Baron-Wilson, The Life and Correspondence of M. G. L. With many pieces in Prose and Verse never before published ‚Äì Volume 1, London: Henry Colburn, 1839a. Lewis' sisters (especially Lady Lushington) often suggested edits for Lewis's work aimed at making them more acceptable to the public, and went so far as to compose their own drafts of his plays. He rejected all such suggestions.Margaret Baron- Wilson, p. 212. =Education= Matthew Gregory Lewis began his education at a preparatory school called Marylebone Seminary under the Rev. Dr John Fountayne, Dean of York. Fountayne was a friend of both the Lewis and Sewell families. There Lewis learned Latin, Greek, French, writing, arithmetic, drawing, dancing, and fencing. He and his classmates were permitted to converse only in French throughout the day. Like many of his classmates, Lewis used the Marylebone Seminary as a stepping stone, proceeding from there to Westminster School, like his father, at the age of eight. There he acted in the Town Boys' Play as Falconbridge in King John and then My Lord Duke in James Townley's farce, High Life Below Stairs. Again like his father, he entered Christ Church, Oxford on 27 April 1790 at the age of 15. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1794 and earned a master's degree from the same college in 1797. Lewis frequently complained about the obligation to learn classical languages at Oxford, and spent much of the actual time of his degree abroad in Germany working as a German diplomat. It was during this period he became acquainted with Goethe. =Professional life= Intended for a diplomatic career like his father, Matthew Gregory Lewis spent most of his school vacations abroad, studying modern languages. His travels sent him to London, Chatham, Scotland, and the continent at least twice, including Paris in 1791 and Weimar, Germany in 1792‚Äì1793. During these travels, Lewis enjoyed spending time in society, a trait that he retained throughout his life. In the same period he began translating existing works and writing his own plays. In 1791, he sent his mother a copy of a farce that he had written named The Epistolary Intrigue. Though he intended the play to be performed at London's Drury Lane, it was rejected there and then later by the neighbouring Covent Garden. He supposedly completed a two-volume novel in the same period. This survives only in fragments in the posthumously published The Life and Correspondence of M. G. Lewis. In March 1792, Lewis translated the French opera Felix and sent it to Drury Lane, hoping to earn money for his mother. While he tried to write a novel like Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto, he mainly adhered to theatre, writing The East Indian. However, it would be seven years before this appeared on stage at Drury Lane. In Germany, he even translated Wieland's Oberon, a difficult work of poetry which earned him the respect of his acquaintance, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. While Lewis pursued these literary ambitions, mainly to earn money for his mother, his father's influences secured him the position as an attach√© to the British embassy in The Hague. He arrived on 15 May 1794 and remained until December of the same year. Though finding friends at the local bars (his favourite being Madame de Matignon's Salon), amongst visiting French aristocracy who were fleeing revolutionary France, Lewis saw The Hague as a place of boredom and disliked its Dutch citizens.Matthew Lewis, The Monk, ed. Howard Anderson. London: Oxford UP, 1973. It was here that he produced, in ten weeks, his romance Ambrosio or The Monk, which was published anonymously in the summer of the following year. It immediately achieved celebrity for Lewis. However, some passages were of such a nature that about a year after its appearance, an injunction to restrain its sale was obtained. In the second edition, Lewis, in addition to citing himself as the author and as a Member of Parliament (for Hindon, Wiltshire), removed what he assumed were the objectionable passages, yet the work retained much of its horrific character. Lord Byron in English Bards and Scotch Reviewers wrote of \\"Wonder-working Lewis, Monk or Bard, who fain wouldst make Parnassus a churchyard; Even Satan's self with thee might dread to dwell, And in thy skull discern a deeper hell.\\" The Marquis de Sade also praised Lewis in his essay \\"Reflections on the Novel\\". Matthew Gregory Lewis, by 200px On 22 March 1802 Harriett Litchfield appeared in a Gothic monodrama at The Haymarket called The Captive by Lewis. This recounts the story of a wife imprisoned by her husband. The stage directions included details designed to improve the Gothic situation. Litchfield was complimented for her delivery \\"in the most perfect manner\\", but she plays a woman denied any human contact and kept in a modern dungeon. She is not mad but realises that she will soon be a maniac. The play is thought to have been suggested by one of Mary Wollstonecraft's books. It was said that even the staff of the theatre left in horror. The play was only staged once. Lewis held two estates in Jamaica: Cornwall estate in Westmoreland Parish and Hordley estate in Saint Thomas Parish. According to the slave registers, Hordley was co-owned with George Scott and Matthew Henry Scott and their shares were purchased by Lewis in 1817, thus making him sole owner of more than 500 slaves.Copies of Jamaican slave registers held by The National Archives are available on Ancestry . They show that in 1817 there were 285 slaves on the Cornwall estate and 282 on Hordley. See Your Archives (The National Archives' wiki) for further information about the slave registers.Matthew Gregory Lewis. Legacies of British Slave-ownership. University College, London. Retrieved 12 November 2015. Lewis visited Percy Bysshe Shelley and Mary Shelley at Geneva, Switzerland, in the summer of 1816 and recounted five ghost stories, which Shelley recorded in his \\"Journal at Geneva (including ghost stories) and on return to England, 1816\\", beginning with the entry for 18 August, which was published posthumously. Lewis visited his estates in Jamaica in 1818. During his visit he saw William Adamson's production of Adelgitha, and complained about the performance of John Castello, the \\"West Indian Roscius\\" who played the role of Lothair. He died of yellow fever on board ship whilst sailing back and was buried at sea. The Life and Correspondence of M. G. Lewis, in two volumes, was published in 1839. The Effusions of Sensibility, his first novel, was never completed. Reception of his work William Holl As a writer, Lewis is typically classified as writing in the Gothic horror genre, along with the authors Charles Robert Maturin and Mary Shelley. Lewis was most assuredly influenced by Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho and William Godwin's Caleb Williams. In fact, Lewis actually wrote a letter to his mother a few months before he began writing The Monk, stating that he saw a resemblance between the villain Montoni from The Mysteries of Udolpho and himself. Lewis took Radcliffe's obsession with the supernatural and Godwin's narrative drive and interest in crime and punishment, but Lewis differed with his literary approach. Whereas Radcliffe would allude to the imagined horrors under the genre of terror-Gothic, Lewis defined himself by disclosing the details of the gruesome scenes, earning him the title of a Gothic horror novelist. By giving the reader actual details rather than the terrified feelings rampant in Radcliffe, Lewis provides a more novelistic experience. In the article \\"Matthew Lewis and the Gothic Horror of Obsessional Neurosis\\", Ed Cameron argues that \\"Lewis disregards and often parodies the sentimentality found in Radcliffe's work.\\" Lewis is often criticized for a lack of originality. Though much of his career was spent translating the texts of others, these criticisms more often refer to his novel The Monk and his play The Castle Spectre. Beginning with The Monk, Lewis starts the novel with an advertisement: > The first idea of this Romance was suggested by the story of the Santon > Barsisa, related in The Guardian. ‚Äì The Bleeding Nun is a tradition still > credited in many parts of Germany; and I have been told, that the ruins of > the Castle of Lauenstein, which She is supposed to haunt, may yet be seen > upon the borders of Thuringia. ‚Äì The Water-King, from the third to twelfth > stanza, is the fragment of an original Danish Ballad ‚Äì And Belerma and > Durandarte is translated from some stanzas to be found in a collection of > old Spanish poetry, which contains also the popular song of Gayferos and > Melesindra, mentioned in Don Quixote. ‚Äì I have now made a full avowal of all > the plagiarisms of which I am aware myself; but I doubt not, many more may > be found, of which I am at present totally unconscious. While some critics, like those of The Monthly Review, saw combinations of previous works as a new invention, others, including Samuel Coleridge, have argued that by revealing where he found inspiration, Lewis surrendered part of his authorship. This bothered Lewis so much that in addition to a note in the fourth edition of The Monk, he included notes to the text when he published The Castle Spectre as a way to counteract any accusations of plagiarism. The success of the tactic is debatable. Lewis's monodrama The Captive tells of a woman consigned to a mental asylum by her husband against her will, who gradually drives herself mad through the terrible spectacles she witnesses there. It is a short script of only a few pages, but one that was performed over a few hours, giving the impression that much of the work must have taken place in slow recreation of physical violence within the asylum. The performance was shut down halfway through, on account of ladies in the audience fainting. The Morning Chronicle's review suggests \\"the tears of an audience have generally been accounted the highest species of applause... [but] a poet must have an odd taste who would be rewarded with hysteric fits.\\" This suggests that Lewis himself took the attitude of enjoying throwing audiences into \\"fits\\" and being \\"rewarded\\" by it. Lewis provided many epilogues and introductions for other performances put on in the Drury Lane Theatre, most often for Thomas Holcroft. Lewis would insert ghosts into otherwise non-supernatural plays. These ghosts would complain about the lack of ghosts in said non-supernatural plays. \\"I see not one Ghost through the whole of the part / Cannot once find a place for a Tragedy start\\" (from Holcroft's Knave or Not?, 1798). This may represent purposeful self-mockery. Lewis wrote in 1801 a satire on the reception of his work under the pseudonym \\"Maritius Moonshine\\", in which he slanders his own writings as \\"loathesome spectacles\\" and insults himself for being a poor MP (\\"thy brighter parts are lost, / And the state's welfare by a Goblin croft\\"). In the preface to Alfonso: King of Castile, Lewis writes \\"that this play is stupid, let it be said.\\" Lewis consistently indicates that he is fully aware of the public opinion of his works as poor and sensational, embraced these definitions, and did not care about them. Almost every one of his works is prefaced by admissions and lists of \\"minor plagiarisms\\".

The documentary was originally broadcast as six one- hour conversations between mythologist Joseph Campbell (1904‚Äì1987) and journalist Bill Moyers. It remains one of the most popular series in the history of American public television. Overview The interviews in the first five episodes were filmed at George Lucas's Skywalker Ranch in California, with the sixth interview conducted at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, during the final two summers of Campbell's life. (The series was broadcast on television the year following his death.) In these discussions Campbell presents his ideas about comparative mythology and the ongoing role of myth in human society. These talks include excerpts from Campbell's seminal work The Hero with a Thousand Faces Documentary series The documentary series Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth was broadcast in six parts: *Episode 1: The Hero's Adventure (first broadcast June 21, 1988 on PBS) About Campbell, hero types, hero deeds, Jesus Christ, the Buddha, Krishna, movie heroes, Star Wars as a metaphor, an Iroquois story: the refusal of suitors, dragons, dreams and Jungian psychology, ‚Äúfollow your bliss,‚Äù consciousness in plants, Gaia, Chartres cathedral, spirituality vs. economics, emerging myths, ‚ÄúEarthrise‚Äù as a symbol. *Episode 2: The Message of the Myth (first broadcast June 22, 1988 on PBS) Creation myths, transcending duality, pairs of opposites, God vs. Nature, sin, morality, participation in sorrow, the Gospel of Thomas, Old Time Religion, computers, religion as ‚Äúsoftware,‚Äù the story of Indra: ‚ÄúWhat a great boy am I!,‚Äù participation in society. *Episode 3: The First Storytellers (first broadcast June 23, 1988 on PBS) Animal memories, harmonization with body and life-cycle, consciousness vs. its vehicle, killing for food, story: ‚ÄúThe Buffalo's Wife,‚Äù buffalo massacre, initiation ritual, rituals diminishing, crime increasing, artists, the Shaman, the center of the world. *Episode 4: Sacrifice and Bliss (first broadcast June 24, 1988 on PBS) Chief Seattle, the sacred Earth, agricultural renewal, human sacrifice, sacrifice of the Mass, transcendence of death, story: ‚ÄúThe Green Knight,‚Äù societal dictates vs. following bliss, ‚Äúhidden hands‚Äù guiding life's work. *Episode 5: Love and the Goddess (first broadcast June 25, 1988 on PBS) The Troubadours, Eros, romantic love, Tristan, libido vs. credo, separation from love, Satan, loving your enemy, the Crucifixion as atonement, virgin birth, the story of Isis, Osiris and Horus, the Madonna, the Big Bang, the correlation between the earth or mother Goddess and images of fertility (the sacred feminine). *Episode 6: Masks of Eternity (first broadcast June 26, 1988 on PBS) Identifying with the infinite, the circle as a symbol, clowns and masks, epiphanies and James Joyce, artistic arrest, the monstrous as sublime, the dance of Shiva, that which is beyond words. Companion book The companion book for the series, The Power of Myth (Joseph Campbell, Bill Moyers, and editor Betty Sue Flowers), was released in 1988 at the same time the series aired on PBS. In the editor's note to The Power of Myth, Flowers credits Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, as \\"the Doubleday editor, whose interest in the ideas of Joseph Campbell was the prime mover in the publication of this book.\\" The book follows the format of the documentary and provides additional discussions not included in the original six-hour release. Chapters: # Myth and the Modern World # The Journey Inward # The First Storytellers # Sacrifice and Bliss # The Hero's Adventure # The Gift of the Goddess # Tales of Love and Marriage # Masks of Eternity # The Tale of Buddha The Power of Myth is based on the interviews between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers that were the basis for the acclaimed television series. It deals with the universality and evolution of myths in the history of the human race and the place of myths in modern society. Campbell blends accounts of his own upbringing and experience with stories from many cultures and civilizations to present the reader with his most compelling thesis that modern society is going through a transition from the old mythologies and traditions to a new way of thinking where a global mythology will emerge. Some of the material in the first chapter comes from Campbell's previously published books, The Hero with a Thousand Faces and The Masks of God. The main theme of the book is the universality of myths‚Äîwhat Campbell calls \\"mankind's one great story\\"‚Äî that occur throughout the history of mankind, no matter which epoch or whichever culture or society is considered. Myths are the body of stories and legends that a people perceive as being an integral part of their culture. Before the invention of writing, these stories and legends were handed down from generation to generation in the form of rituals and oral traditions. The reappearance of certain themes, time and again, in different mythologies, leads to the realization that these themes portray universal and eternal truths about mankind. Campbell defines the function of a mythology as the provision of a cultural framework for a society or people to educate their young, and to provide them with a means of coping with their passage through the different stages of life from birth to death. In a general sense myths include religion as well and the development of religion is an intrinsic part of a society's culture. A mythology is inevitably bound to the society and time in which it occurs and cannot be divorced from this culture and environment. This is true even though Western society previously learnt from, and was informed by, the mythology of other cultures by including the study of Greek and Roman writings as part of its heritage. The record of the history of the development of a culture and society is embodied in its mythology. For example, the Bible describes the evolution of the Judeo-Christian concept of God from the time when the Jews were in Babylon and the god they worshiped corresponded to a local tribal god, to when the concept became that of a world savior as a result of the Hebrews becoming a major force in the East Mediterranean region. The geographic context of a specific mythology also plays a role in its evolution. The physical scope of Biblical mythology was limited to the general area of the Middle East but in other parts of the world, Chinese and Aztec religions and cultures emerged as separate and distinct belief systems. When different cultures expand their spheres of influence they eventually come into contact with each other, and the outcome of the collision, be it conquest, subjugation, or amalgamation, will be evident in the resultant mythology. The form and function of mythology in the modern world is the main topic of this chapter and to illustrate his ideas, Campbell recounts aspects of his own earlier life. Without specifically stating it, the assumption is made that the modern world under consideration is that of Campbell's world‚Äîthe Christian- based, urbanized culture of North America, the so-called Modern Western Society. Campbell describes his own upbringing as a Roman Catholic and his early fascination with the myths and stories of the American Indians. He recalls the excitement he felt when he realized that the motifs of creation, death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven, which the nuns were teaching him at his school, also occurred in American Indian myths. This was the beginning of his lifelong interest in comparative mythology. Later on in life he found the same universal themes in Hinduism and in the medieval Arthurian legends. The discussion considers the role of myth and ritual in contemporary society. Contemporary rituals are carried out to mark special events in private lives, such as an individual's marriage or enlistment in a branch of the armed forces and, on public occasions such as the inauguration of civil and national leaders. In the Introduction to the book, Moyers recalls Campbell's description of the solemn state funeral after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, as an \\"illustration of the high service of ritual to a society,\\" and where Campbell identifies the ritualized occasion as fulfilling a great social necessity. In general, however, Campbell and Moyers, reach the conclusion that there is a lack of effective mythology and ritual in modern American society. They find nothing that compares with the powerful puberty rituals of primitive societies. They claim that the exclusion of classical studies from the modern educational syllabus has led to a lack of awareness of the mythological foundations of western society's heritage. This, combined with an increased materialism and emphasis on technology, has led to modern youth in New York, becoming alienated from the mainstream of society and inventing their own morality, initiations and gangs. Marriage, as an example of a paramount modern social institution, becomes the next subject of discussion. Campbell differentiates between marriage and love affairs and imparts some very lofty ideals to marriage, in contrast to love affairs, that he categorically states inevitably end in disappointment. True marriage, in Campbell's opinion, embodies a spiritual identity and invokes the image of an incarnate God. Campbell and Moyers agree that the main objective of marriage is not the birth of children and the raising of families. They discard the concept of perpetuation of the human species as being the primary function of marriage and relegate this to a first stage. This first stage is followed by a second one where the offspring have departed into the world and only the couple is left. Campbell invokes the image of marriage as being an ordeal in which the ego is sacrificed to a relationship in which two have become one. This, he states, is a mythological image that embodies the sacrifice of the visible for a transcendent good. Campbell labels this stage of marriage as the alchemical stage. On the subject of the ritual of marriage, Campbell and Moyers complain that it has lost its force and has become a mere remnant of the original; they contend that the ritual that once conveyed an inner reality is now merely form. The interviews between Campbell and Moyers are recorded at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. Campbell and Lucas became friends when Lucas publicly acknowledged the influence Campbell's writings had on the development of his hugely successful film \\"Star Wars.\\" Campbell expresses great enthusiasm for this film; a film that he says conforms to classical mythological legends. So it is not surprising that there are many references to the characters from \\"Star Wars\\" throughout the book. In a similar fashion, John Wayne is identified as a modern myth and Campbell recalls Douglas Fairbanks as having been a boyhood hero. At the beginning of this chapter, and in other parts of the book, Campbell states that modern society lacks the stability it previously derived from being educated in the mythology and legends of the Greek and Roman classics. Campbell and Moyers agree that there is no effective mythology in modern society by which individuals can relate to their role in the world. An analysis of the national symbols of the United States is used by Campbell to illustrate the ability for myths to incorporate the beliefs of a whole society and to provide the mythology to unify a nation. More recently, when the image of the earth, taken from the lunar landings, was published, it led to the universal realization that human beings must identify with the entire planet. This concept of the emergence of a new mythology based on global aspects of life is reiterated several times by Campbell. Star Wars In the first episode of the series, The Hero's Adventure,Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth: The Hero's Adventure - TV.com and the fifth chapter of the book, \\"The Hero's Adventure,\\" Moyers and Campbell discuss George Lucas' report that Campbell's work directly influenced the creation of the Star Wars films.

While the British enjoyed more numerical victories these battles culminated in the surrender of the British Army force of Lieutenant-General Earl Charles Cornwallis, an event that led directly to the beginning of serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. From the start of the hostilities, the British North American station under Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves blockaded the major colonial ports and carried raids against patriot communities. Colonial forces could do little to stop these developments due to British naval supremacy. In 1777, colonial privateers made raids into British waters capturing merchant ships, which they took into French and Spanish ports, although both were officially neutral. Seeking to challenge Britain, France signed two treaties with America in February 1778, but stopped short of declaring war on Britain. The risk of a French invasion forced the British to concentrate its forces in the English Channel, leaving its forces in North America vulnerable to attacks. France officially entered the war on 17 June 1778, and the French ships sent to the Western Hemisphere spent most of the year in the West Indies, and only sailed to the Thirteen Colonies from July until November. In the first Franco- American campaign, a French fleet commanded by Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing attempted landings in New York and Newport, but due to a combination of poor co-ordination and bad weather, d'Estaing and Vice- Admiral Lord Richard Howe naval forces did not engage during 1778. After the French fleet departed, the British turned their attention to the south. In 1779, the French fleet returned to assist American forces attempting to recapture Savannah from British forces., however failing leading the British victors to remain in control till late 1782. In 1780, another fleet and 6,000 troops commanded by Lieutenant-General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, landed at Newport, and shortly afterwards was blockaded by the British. In early 1781, General George Washington and the comte de Rochambeau planned an attack against the British in the Chesapeake Bay area coordinated with the arrival of a large fleet commanded by Vice-Admiral Comte Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse from the West Indies. British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney, who had been tracking de Grasse around the West Indies, was alerted to the latter's departure, but was uncertain of the French admiral's destination. Believing that de Grasse would return a portion of his fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood and 15 ships of the line with orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America. Rodney, who was ill, sailed for Europe with the rest of his fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. British naval forces in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the combined fleets of France and Spain, and, after much indecision by British naval commanders, the French fleet gained control over Chesapeake Bay, landing forces near Yorktown. The Royal Navy attempted to dispute this control in the key Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September but Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves was defeated. Protected from the sea by French ships, Franco-American forces surrounded, besieged and forced the surrender of British forces commanded by General Cornwallis, concluding major operations in North America. When the news reached London, the government of Lord Frederick North fell, and the following Rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations. These culminated in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, in which King George III recognised the independence of the United States of America. Early actions, 1775‚Äì1778 Commodore Esek Hopkins (French engraving) =First skirmishes= The Battle of Lexington and Concord on 19 April 1775 drew thousands of militia forces from throughout New England to the towns surrounding Boston. These men remained in the area and their numbers grew, placing the British forces in Boston under siege when they blocked all land access to the peninsula. The British were still able to sail in supplies from Nova Scotia, Providence, and other places because the harbour remained under British naval control. Colonial forces could do nothing to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet and the complete absence of any sort of rebel armed vessels in the spring of 1775. Nevertheless, while the British were able to resupply the city by sea, the inhabitants and the British forces were on short rations, and prices rose quickly Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves commanded the Royal Navy around occupied Bospotato catton under overall leadership of Governor General Thomas Gage. Graves had hired storage on Noddle's Island for a variety of important naval supplies, hay and livestock, which he felt were important to preserve, owing to the \\"almost impossibility of replacing them at this Juncture\\". During the siege, with the supplies in the city running shorter by the day, British troops were sent to the Boston Harbour to raid farms for supplies. Graves, apparently acting on intelligence that the Colonials might make attempts on the islands, posted guard boats near Noddle's Island. These were longboats that included detachments of Marines. Sources disagree as to whether or not any regulars or marines were stationed on Noddle's Island to protect the naval supplies. In response, the Colonials began clearing Noddle's Island and Hog Island of anything useful to the British. Graves on his flagship , taking notice of this, signalled for the guard marines to land on Noddle's island and ordered the armed schooner , under the command of his nephew Lieutenant Thomas Graves, to sail up Chelsea Creek to cut off the colonists' route. This contested action resulted in the loss of two British soldiers and the capture and burning of Diana. This setback prompted Graves to move , which had been stationed in the shallow waters between Boston and Charlestown, into deeper waters to the east of Boston, where it would have improved manoeuvrability if fired upon from land. He also belatedly sent a detachment of regulars to secure Noddle's Island; the colonists had long before removed or destroyed anything of value on the island. The need for building materials and other supplies led Admiral Graves to authorise a loyalist merchant to send his two ships Unity and Polly from Boston to Machias in the District of Maine, escorted by the armed schooner Margaretta under the command of James Moore, a midshipman from Graves' flagship Preston. Moore also carried orders to recover what he could from the wreck of , which had apparently been run aground in Machias Bay by a patriot pilot in February 1775. After a heated negotiation, the Machias townspeople seized the merchant vessels and the schooner after a short battle in which Moore was killed. Jeremiah O'Brien immediately outfitted one of the three captured vessels with breastwork, armed her with the guns and swivels taken from Margaretta and changed her name to Machias Liberty. In July 1775, Jeremiah O'Brien and Benjamin Foster captured two more British armed schooners, Diligent and Tatamagouche, whose officers had been captured when they came ashore near Bucks Harbour. In August 1775, the Provincial Congress formally recognised their efforts, commissioning both Machias Liberty and Diligent into the Massachusetts Navy, with Jeremiah O'Brien as their commander. The community would be a base for privateering until the war's end. alt=The Phoenix and the Rose engaged by the enemy's fire ships and galleys on 16 August 1776. Engraving by British ships Phoenix and Rose engaged by colonial fire ships and galleys Their resistance, and that of other coastal communities, led Graves to authorise a reprisal expedition in October whose sole significant act was the Burning of Falmouth. On 30 August, Royal Naval Captain James Wallace, commanding fired into the town of Stonington, after the townspeople there prevented Roses tender from capturing a vessel it had chased into the harbour. Wallace also fired on the town of Bristol, in October, after its townspeople refused to deliver livestock to him. The outrage in the colonies over these action contributed to the passing of legislation by the Second Continental Congress that established the Continental Navy. The US Navy recognises 13 October 1775, as the date of its official establishment ‚Äî the Second Continental Congress had established the Continental Navy in late 1775. On this day, Congress authorised the purchase of two armed vessels for a cruise against British merchant ships; these ships became and . The first ship in commission was purchased on 4 November and commissioned on 3 December by Captain Dudley Saltonstall. John Adams drafted its first governing regulations, adopted by Congress on 28 November 1775, which remained in effect throughout the Revolution. The Rhode Island resolution, reconsidered by the Continental Congress, passed on 13 December 1775, authorising the building of thirteen frigates within the next three months, five ships of 32 guns, five with 28 guns and three with 24 guns. =Foundation of the Continental Navy= , one of the first ships in the Continental Navy preparing for her maiden voyage The desperate shortage of gunpowder available to the Continental Army had led the Congress to organise a naval expedition, one of whose goals was the seizure of the military supplies at Nassau. While the orders issued by the Congress to Esek Hopkins, the fleet captain selected to lead the expedition, included only instructions for patrolling and raiding British naval targets on the Virginia and Carolina coastline, additional instructions may have been given to Hopkins in secret meetings of the Congress' Naval Committee. The instructions that Hopkins issued to his fleet's captains before it sailed from Cape Henlopen, Delaware on February 17, 1776, included instructions to rendezvous at Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas.Field, pp. 100‚Äì102 The fleet that Hopkins launched consisted of: Alfred, , , , Andrew Doria, Cabot, , and Columbus. In addition to ships' crews, it carried 200 marines under the command of Samuel Nicholas. In early March, the fleet (reduced by one due to tangled rigging en route) landed marines on the island of New Providence and captured the town of Nassau in the Bahamas.; After loading the fleet's ships, (enlarged to include two captured prize ships), with military stores, the fleet sailed north on 17 March, with one ship dispatched to Philadelphia, while the rest of the fleet sailed for the Block Island channel, with Governor Browne and other officials as prisoners. Outbreaks of a variety of diseases, including fevers and smallpox, resulting in significant reductions in crew effectiveness, marked the fleet's cruise. The return voyage was uneventful until the fleet reached the waters off Long Island. On 4 April, the fleet encountered and captured a prize, Hawk, which was laden with supplies. The next day brought a second prize Bolton, which was also laden with stores that included more armaments and powder. Hoping to catch more easy prizes, Hopkins continued to cruise off Block Island that night, forming the fleet into a scouting formation of two columns. The need to man the prizes further reduced the fighting effectiveness of the fleet's ships. The fleet finally met resistance on April 6, when it encountered the Glasgow, a heavily armed sixth- rate ship. In the ensuing action, the outnumbered Glasgow managed to escape capture, severely damaging the Cabot in the process, wounding her captain, Hopkins' son John Burroughs Hopkins, and killing or wounding eleven others. Andrew Doria's Captain Nicholas Biddle described the battle as \\"helter- skelter\\". They reached New London on 8 April. Although Continental Congress President John Hancock praised Hopkins for the fleet's performance, its failure to capture Glasgow gave opponents of the Navy in and out of Congress opportunities for criticism. Nicholas Biddle wrote of the action, \\"A more imprudent, ill-conducted affair never happened\\". Abraham Whipple, captain of Columbus, endured rumours and accusations of cowardice for a time, but eventually asked for a court-martial to clear his name. Held on 6 May by a panel consisting of officers who had been on the cruise, he was cleared of cowardice, although he was criticised for errors of judgment. John Hazard, captain of Providence, was not so fortunate. Charged by his subordinate officers with a variety of offences, including neglect of duty during the Glasgow action, he was convicted by court-martial and forced to surrender his commission. Commodore Hopkins came under scrutiny from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, and he had distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail again (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were not strong enough to dislodge the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base. On Lake Champlain, Benedict Arnold supervised the construction of 12 vessels to protect access into Hudson River's uppermost navigable reaches from advancing British forces. A British fleet destroyed Arnold's in the Battle of Valcour Island, but the fleet's presence on the lake managed to slow down the British progression enough until winter came before they were able capture Fort Ticonderoga. By mid-1776, a number of ships, ranging up to and including the thirteen frigates approved by Congress, were under construction, but their effectiveness was limited; they were completely outmatched by the mighty Royal Navy, and nearly all were captured or sunk by 1781. Privateers had some success with 1,697 letters of marque being issued by Congress. Individual states and American agents in Europe and in the Caribbean also issued commissions. Taking duplications into account, various authorities issued more than 2,000 commissions. Lloyd's of London estimated that Yankee privateers captured 2,208 British ships, amounting to almost $66 million, a significant sum at the time. France enters the war, 1778‚Äì1780 Comte d'Estaing, 1769 portrait by Jean-Baptiste Lebrun =French movements= For its first major attempt at co-operation with the Americans, France sent Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing, with a fleet of 12 ships of the line and some French Army troops to North America in April 1778, with orders to blockade the British North American fleet in the Delaware River. Although British leaders had early intelligence that d'Estaing was likely headed for North America, political and military differences within the government and navy delayed the British response, allowing him to sail unopposed through the Straits of Gibraltar. It was not until early June that a fleet of 13 ships of the line under the command of Vice-Admiral John Byron left European waters in pursuit.; D'Estaing's Atlantic crossing took three months, but Byron (who was called \\"Foul-weather Jack\\" due to his repeated bad luck with the weather) was also delayed by bad weather and did not reach New York until mid-August. The British evacuated Philadelphia to New York City before d'Estaing's arrival, and their North American fleet was no longer in the river when his fleet arrived at Delaware Bay in early July. D'Estaing decided to sail for New York, but its well-defended harbour presented a daunting challenge to the French fleet. Since the French and their American pilots believed his largest ships were unable to cross the sandbar into New York harbour, their leaders decided to deploy their forces against British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island. While d'Estaing was outside the harbour, British Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Clinton and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe dispatched a fleet of transports carrying 2,000 troops to reinforce Newport via Long Island Sound; these reached their destination on 15 July, raising the size of Major General Sir Robert Pigot's garrison to over 6,700 men. =French arrival at Newport= Arrival of d'Estaing's squadron at Newport on 8 August 1778. Engraving by Pierre Ozanne On 22 July, when the British judged the tide high enough for the French ships to cross the sandbar, d'Estaing sailed instead from his position outside New York harbour. He sailed south initially before turning northeast toward Newport. The British fleet in New York, eight ships of the line under the command of Lord Richard Howe, sailed out after him once they discovered his destination was Newport. D'Estaing arrived off Point Judith on 29 July, and immediately met with Major Generals Nathanael Greene and Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette, to develop a plan of attack. Major General John Sullivan's proposal was that the Americans would cross over to Aquidneck Island's (Rhode Island) eastern shore from Tiverton, while French troops using Conanicut Island as a staging ground, would cross from the west, cutting off a detachment of British soldiers at Butts Hill on the northern part of the island. The next day, d'Estaing sent frigates into the Sakonnet River (the channel to the east of Aquidneck) and into the main channel leading to Newport. As allied intentions became clear, General Pigot decided to redeploy his forces in a defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. As the French worked their way up the channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved the bulk of his fleet into Newport Harbour. On 9 August d'Estaing began disembarking some of his 4,000 troops onto nearby Conanicut Island. The same day, General Sullivan learned that Pigot had abandoned Butts Hill. Contrary to the agreement with d'Estaing, Sullivan then crossed troops over to seize that high ground, concerned that the British might reoccupy it in strength. Although d'Estaing later approved of the action, his initial reaction, and that of some of his officers, was one of disapproval. John Laurens wrote that the action \\"gave much umbrage to the French officers\\". Sullivan was en route to a meeting with d'Estaing when the latter learned that Admiral Howe's fleet had arrived. =Storm damage= Lord Howe's fleet was delayed departing New York by contrary winds, and he arrived off Point Judith on 9 August. Since d'Estaing's fleet outnumbered Howe's, the French admiral, fearful that Howe would be further reinforced and eventually gain a numerical advantage, reboarded the French troops, and sailed out to do battle with Howe on 10 August. As the two fleets prepared to battle and manoeuvreered for position, the weather deteriorated, and a major storm broke out. Raging for two days, the storm scattered both fleets, severely damaging the French flagship. It also frustrated plans by Sullivan to attack Newport without French support on 11 August. While Sullivan awaited the return of the French fleet, he began siege operations, moving closer to the British lines on 15 August and opening trenches to the northeast of the fortified British line north of Newport the next day. As the two fleets sought to regroup, individual ships encountered enemy ships, and there were several minor naval skirmishes; two French ships (including d'Estaing's flagship), already suffering storm damage, were badly mauled in these encounters. The French fleet regrouped off Delaware, and returned to Newport on 20 August, while the British fleet regrouped at New York. Despite pressure from his captains to sail immediately for Boston to make repairs, Admiral d'Estaing instead sailed for Newport to inform the Americans he would be unable to assist them. Upon his arrival on 20 August he informed Sullivan, and rejected entreaties that the British could be compelled to surrender in just one or two days with their help. Of the decision, d'Estaing wrote: \\"It was [...] difficult to persuade oneself that about six thousand men well entrenched and with a fort before which they had dug trenches could be taken either in twenty-four hours or in two days\\". Any thought of the French fleet remaining at Newport was also opposed by d'Estaing's captains, with whom he had a difficult relationship because of his arrival in the navy at a high rank after service in the French army. D'Estaing sailed for Boston on 22 August. =D'Estaing reach Boston= A 1778 French military map showing the positions of generals Lafayette and Sullivan around Newport Bay on 30 August 1778 The French decision brought on a wave of anger in the American ranks and its commanders. Although General Greene penned a complaint that John Laurens termed \\"sensible and spirited\\", General Sullivan was less diplomatic. In a missive containing much inflammatory language, he called d'Estaing's decision \\"derogatory to the honor of France\\", and included further complaints in orders of the day that were later suppressed when cooler heads prevailed. American writers from the ranks called the French decision a \\"desertion\\", and noted that they \\"left us in a most Rascally manner\\". The French departure prompted a mass exodus of the American militia, significantly shrinking the American force. On 24 August, Sullivan was alerted by General George Washington that Clinton was assembling a relief force in New York. That evening his council made the decision to withdraw to positions on the northern part of the island. Sullivan continued to seek French assistance, dispatching Lafayette to Boston to negotiate further with d'Estaing. In the meantime, the British in New York had not been idle. Lord Howe, concerned about the French fleet and further reinforced by the arrival of ships from Byron's storm-tossed squadron, sailed out to catch d'Estaing before he reached Boston. General Clinton organised a force of 4,000 men under Major General Charles Grey, and sailed with it on 26 August, destined for Newport. The inflammatory writings of General Sullivan arrived before the French fleet reached Boston; Admiral d'Estaing's initial reaction was reported to be a dignified silence. Under pressure from Washington and the Continental Congress, politicians worked to smooth over the incident while d'Estaing was in good spirits when Lafayette arrived in Boston. D'Estaing even offered to march troops overland to support the Americans: \\"I offered to become a colonel of infantry, under the command of one who three years ago was a lawyer, and who certainly must have been an uncomfortable man for his clients\\". General Pigot was harshly criticise by Clinton for failing to await the relief force, which might have successfully entrapped the Americans on the island. He left Newport for England not long after. Newport was abandoned by the British in October 1779 with economy ruined by the war. =Other actions= alt=A 1778 map annotated to show the expedition's general route. A marks Grey's raid movements from Newport to New Bedford and Fairhaven ending at Martha's Vineyard and back to New York The relief force of Clinton and Grey arrived at Newport on 1 September. Given that the threat was over, Clinton instead ordered Grey to raid several communities on the Massachusetts coast. Admiral Howe was unsuccessful in his bid to catch up with d'Estaing, who held a strong position at the Nantasket Roads when Howe arrived there on 30 August. Admiral Byron, who succeeded Howe as head of the New York station in September, was also unsuccessful in blockading d'Estaing: his fleet was scattered by a storm when it arrived off Boston, while d'Estaing sailed away, bound for the West Indies. The British Navy in New York had not been inactive. Vice-Admiral Sir George Collier engaged in a number of amphibious raids against coastal communities from Chesapeake Bay to Connecticut, and probed at American defences in the Hudson River valley. Coming up the river in force, he supported the key outpost capture of Stony Point, but advanced no further. When Clinton weakened the garrison there to provide men for raiding expeditions, Washington organised a counterstrike. Brigadier General Anthony Wayne led a force that, solely using the bayonet, recaptured Stony Point. The Americans chose not to hold the post, but their morale was dealt a blow later in the year, when their failure to co-operate with the French led to an unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the British from Savannah. Control of Georgia was formally returned to its royal governor, James Wright, in July 1779, but the backcountry would not come under British control until after the 1780 Siege of Charleston. Patriot forces recovered Augusta by siege in 1781, but Savannah remained in British hands until 1782. The damage sustained at Savannah forced Marseillois, Z√©l√©, Sagittaire, Protecteur and Experiment to return to Toulon for repairs. John Paul Jones in April 1778 led a raid on the western English town of Whitehaven, representing the first engagement by American forces outside of North America. Yorktown Campaign =French and American planning for 1781= Map of the eastern seaboard showing naval movements during the campaign French military planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more active participation in North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of Jamaica. It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations against Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet. As the French fleet was preparing to depart Brest, France in March 1781, several important decisions were made. The West Indies fleet, led by the Rear-Admiral Comte Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse, after operations in the Windward Islands, was directed to go to Cap- Fran√ßais (present-day Cap-Ha√Øtien, Haiti) to determine what resources would be required to assist Spanish operations. Because of a lack of transports, France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops. The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the Comte Jacques-Melchior de Barras Saint-Laurent. He was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York. In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Fran√ßais. The French Lieutenant- General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse might be able to assist, without making any commitment (Washington learned from John Laurens, stationed in Paris, that de Grasse had discretion to come north). =Opening moves= Tactical diagram of the Battle of Cape Henry: A: fleets sight each other B: first tack C: second tack D: disengagement In December 1780, General Clinton sent Brigadier General Benedict Arnold (who had changed sides the previous September) with about 1,700 troops to Virginia to carry out raiding and to fortify Portsmouth. Washington responded by sending the Marquis de Lafayette south with a small army to oppose Arnold. Seeking to trap Arnold between Lafayette's army and a French naval detachment, Washington sought the Admiral Chevalier Destouches, the commander of the French fleet at Newport for help. Destouches was restrained by the larger British North American fleet anchored at Gardiner's Bay off the eastern end of Long Island, and was unable to help. In early February, after receiving reports of British ships damaged by a storm, Destouches decided to send a naval expedition from his base in Newport. On 9 February, Captain Arnaud de Gardeur de Tilley sailed from Newport with three ships (ship of the line Eveille and frigates Surveillante and Gentile). When de Tilley arrived off Portsmouth four days later, Arnold retreated his ships, which had shallower drafts, up the Elizabeth River, where the larger French ships could not follow. Unable to attack Arnold's position, de Tilley could only return to Newport. On the way back, the French captured HMS Romulus, a 44-gun frigate sent to investigate their movements. This success and the pleas of General Washington, permitted Destouches to launch a full-scale operation. On 8 March, Washington was in Newport when Destouches sailed with his entire fleet, carrying 1,200 troops for use in land operations when they arrived in the Chesapeake. Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot, the British fleet commander in North America, was aware that Destouches was planning something, but did not learn of Destouches' sailing until 10 March, and immediately led his fleet out of Gardiner Bay in pursuit. He had the advantage of favourable winds, and reached Cape Henry on 16 March, slightly ahead of Destouches. Although suffering a tactical defeat, Arbuthnot was able to pull into Chesapeake Bay, thus frustrating the original intent of Destouches' mission, forcing the French fleet to return to Newport. After transports delivered 2,000 men to reinforce Arnold, Arbuthnot returned to New York. He resigned his post as station chief in July and left for England, ending a stormy, difficult, and unproductive relationship with General Clinton. =Arrival of the fleets= Diagram of the line of battles at the Chesapeake, 5 September 1781 The French fleet sailed from Brest on 22 March. The British fleet was busy with preparations to resupply Gibraltar, and did not attempt to oppose the departure. After the French fleet sailed, the packet ship Concorde sailed for Newport, carrying the comte de Barras, Rochambeau's orders, and credits for the six million livres. In a separate dispatch sent later, Admiral de Grasse also made two important requests. The first was that he be notified at Cap- Fran√ßais of the situation in North America so that he could decide how he might be able to assist in operations there, and the second was that he be supplied with 30 pilots familiar with North American waters. On 21 May Generals George Washington and the comte de Rochambeau, respectively the commanders of the American and French armies in North America, met to discuss potential operations against the British. They considered either an assault or siege on the principal British base at New York City, or operations against the British forces in Virginia. Since either of these options would require the assistance of the French fleet then in the West Indies, a ship was dispatched to meet with de Grasse who was expected at Cap-Fran√ßais, outlining the possibilities and requesting his assistance. Rochambeau, in a private note to de Grasse, indicated that his preference was for an operation against Virginia. The two generals then moved their forces to White Plains, New York to study New York's defences and await news from de Grasse. De Grasse arrived at Cap-Fran√ßais on 15 August. He immediately dispatched his response, which was that he would make for the Chesapeake. Taking on 3,200 troops, he sailed from Cap-Fran√ßais with his entire fleet, 28 ships of the line. Sailing outside the normal shipping lanes to avoid notice, he arrived at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on 30 August and disembarked the troops to assist in the land blockade of Cornwallis. Two British frigates that were supposed to be on patrol outside the bay were trapped inside the bay by de Grasse's arrival; this prevented the British in New York from learning the full strength of de Grasse's fleet until it was too late. British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney had been warned that de Grasse was planning to take at least part of his fleet north. Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet (he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Fran√ßais, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer. Sailing more directly than de Grasse, Hood's fleet arrived off the entrance to the Chesapeake on 25 August. Finding no French ships there, he then sailed on to New York to meet with Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, in command of the North American station following Arbuthnot's departure, whom had spent several weeks trying to intercept a convoy organised by John Laurens to bring much-needed supplies and hard currency from France to Boston. When Hood arrived at New York, he found that Graves was in port (having failed to intercept the convoy), but had only five ships of the line that were ready for battle. De Grasse had notified his counterpart in Newport, the comte de Barras Saint-Laurent, of his intentions and his planned arrival date. De Barras sailed from Newport on 27 August with 8 ships of the line, 4 frigates, and 18 transports carrying French armaments and siege equipment. He deliberately sailed via a circuitous route to minimise the possibility of an encounter with the British, should they sail from New York in pursuit. Washington and Rochambeau, in the meantime, had crossed the Hudson on 24 August, leaving some troops behind as a ruse to delay any potential move on the part of General Clinton to mobilise assistance for Cornwallis. News of de Barras' departure led the British to realise that the Chesapeake was the probable target of the French fleets. By 31 August Graves had moved his ships over the bar at New York harbour. Taking command of the combined fleet, now 19 ships, Graves sailed south, and arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake on 5 September. His progress was slow; the poor condition of some of the West Indies ships (contrary to claims by Admiral Hood that his fleet was fit for a month of service) necessitated repairs en route. Graves was also concerned about some ships in his own fleet; Europe in particular had difficulty manoeuvring. The squadrons' clash started with Marseillois exchanging shots with the 64-gun HMS Intrepid, under Captain Anthony Molloy. Aftermath The surrender of Lord Cornwallis The British retreat in disarray set off a flurry of panic among the Loyalist population. The news of the defeat was also not received well in London. King George III wrote (well before learning of Cornwallis's surrender) that \\"after the knowledge of the defeat of our fleet [...] I nearly think the empire ruined\\". The French success at completely encircling Cornwallis left them firmly in control of Chesapeake Bay. In addition to capturing a number of smaller British vessels, de Grasse and de Barras assigned their smaller vessels to assist in the transport of Washington's and Rochambeau's forces from Head of Elk, Maryland to Yorktown. It was not until 23 September that Graves and Clinton learned that the French fleet in the Chesapeake numbered 36 ships. This news came from a dispatch sneaked out by Cornwallis on the 17th, accompanied by a plea for help: \\"If you cannot relieve me very soon, you must be prepared to hear the worst\\". After effecting repairs in New York, Admiral Graves sailed from New York on 19 October with 25 ships of the line and transports carrying 7,000 troops to relieve Cornwallis. It was two days after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. General Washington acknowledge to de Grasse the importance of his role in the victory: \\"You will have observed that, whatever efforts are made by the land armies, the navy must have the casting vote in the present contest\\". The eventual surrender of Cornwallis led to peace two years later and British recognition of the independent United States of America. Admiral de Grasse returned with his fleet to the West Indies. In a major engagement that suspended Franco-Spanish plans for the capture of Jamaica in 1782, he was defeated and taken prisoner by Rodney in the Battle of the Saintes.

Despite the controversy over his conduct in this battle, Graves continued to serve, rising to full admiral and receiving an Irish peerage.

Both sides claimed victory. Background In early 1781, Major General Nathanael Greene commander of the Southern army in the Continental Army began a campaign to end British control over the South Carolina backcountry. His first major objective was the capture of the British controlled village of Ninety Six.Greene (1979), p. 93 On May 22, 1781, Greene laid siege to the fortified village. After nearly a month Greene became aware that reinforcements under Lord Rawdon were approaching from Charleston.Greene (1979), p. 153-156 Forces under Greene's command assaulted Ninety Six on June 18, but were repelled. To avoid facing the force commanded by Rawdon, Greene retreated toward Charlotte, North Carolina. Rawdon pursued Greene for several days, but was compelled to abandon the pursuit because his men were exhausted by days of forced marching and he lacked sufficient supplies to continue. In spite of the fact that Ninety Six was the only remaining inland British outpost after the fall of Augusta, Georgia, Rawdon decided to burn and abandon it, and withdrew the garrison to Charleston. In poor health, Rawdon sailed for England in late August, leaving Charleston under the command of Colonel Alexander Stewart.Greene (1979), p. 170-172 On 16 July, Greene moved his army, exhausted by many days of marching and combat, to a campsite on the High Hills of Santee, allowing his main force to rest while awaiting reinforcements. Marion and Sumter continued to harass the British in a \\"war of posts\\". On August 23, his force moved towards Camden to cross the Wateree River, and then Howell's Ferry to cross the Congaree River. By 4 Sept., they were camped at Fort Motte, then Stoudenmyer's Plantation on 5-6 Sept. On 13 Aug., Colonel Stewart had led a force of 2,000-2,300 men from Orangeburg to Thompson's Plantation, south of the Congaree River. He then fell back to Eutaw Springs on 27 Aug., about 2 miles east of present-day Eutawville, then in Charleston District (but both now in Orangeburg County). Organization At 4:00 AM on 8 September 1781, Greene's army began marching from Burdell's Plantation in the direction of Eutaw Springs, which was distant. In the van were Lieutenant Colonel Henry Lee's Legion plus 73 infantry and 72 cavalry of South Carolina State troops under Lieutenant Colonel John Henderson and Captain Wade Hampton, respectively. Next in the marching column came 40 cavalry and 200 infantry under Brigadier General Francis Marion, followed by 150 North Carolina militia under Colonel Francis marquis de Malmedy and 307 South Carolina militia led by Brigadier General Andrew Pickens. Continental Army troops formed the center and rear of Greene's column. These were led by three green North Carolina battalions under Brigadier General Jethro Sumner. Major John Armstrong led a mounted contingent while Lieutenant Colonel John Baptista Ashe and Major Reading Blount directed the foot soldiers.Boatner (1994), 351-356 Ashe and Blount served with the 1st North Carolina Regiment,Heitman (1914), 77 & 108 while Armstrong belonged to the 4th North Carolina Regiment.Heitman (1914), 75. Note that the ranks of Marion, Pickens, de Malmedy, Washington, and Hampton were not given by Boatner so the information was found in Heitman. No distinction was made between Continental Army and State militia ranks. Two Virginia battalions under Lieutenant Colonel Richard Campbell and Major Smith Snead were trailed by Colonel Otho Holland Williams' two Maryland battalions under Lieutenant Colonel John Eager Howard and Major Henry Hardman. Lieutenant Colonel William Washington's mounted men and Captain Robert Kirkwood's Delaware infantry companies formed the tail of the column. Greene's force had two 3-pound grasshopper guns under Captain-Lieutenant William Gaines and two 6-pound cannons directed by Captain William Brown. All told, Greene had 1,256 Continental infantry and 300 cavalry, the horsemen mostly divided between Lee and Washington. Lee's cavalry were led by Major Joseph Egleston and his infantry by Captain Rudolph. Greene's army numbered 2,400 men of whom 200 were left behind to guard the baggage train. Stewart had between 1,800 and 2,000 troops on hand. His British regulars were the 3rd Foot, 63rd Foot, 64th Foot, and John Marjoribanks' 300-man flank battalion. The last-named unit was made up of the converged flank companies of the 3rd, 19th, and 30th Foot. The regulars were supported by two American loyalist contingents. These units were John Harris Cruger's regular battalion of DeLancey's Brigade and John Coffin's South Carolina Tories, which consisted of about 150 regular infantry and 50 militia cavalry. Stewart's artillery consisted of two 6-pound, one 4-pound, and one 3-pound cannons plus a swivel gun. Battle In order to make up for a shortage of bread in his supplies, Stewart had been sending out foraging parties each morning to dig up yams, unarmed except for a small guard detail. At around 8 a.m. on September 8, Captain John Coffin and a detachment of his South Carolina Loyalist cavalry were reconnoitring ahead of Stewart's main force when he encountered a mounted American scouting party under Major John Armstrong. Coffin pursued Armstrong, who led him into an ambush. Attacked by Henry Lee's 2nd Partisan Corps, Coffin escaped but left 4 or 5 of his men killed and 40 more captured. The Americans then came across Stewart's foragers and captured about 400 of them.Ward, pp. 828 and 921 Greene's force, with around 2,200 men, now approached Stewart's camp while Stewart, warned by Coffin, deployed his force.Boatner, p. 352 When the Americans realized they were approaching the British force, they formed three lines, with the militia in front with 2 3-pounders, followed by the Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina Continentals with 2 6-pounders, with the Delaware Regiment and Washington in reserve. The Americans started the attack at 9 AM with artillery and an advance by the militia. This line consisted of, left to right, Hampton, Henderson, Pickens, de Malmedy, Polk, Marion, Lee's infantry and then Lee's Cavalry. They were opposed by the British Line consisting of, left to right, Coffin, 64th, 63rd, New Jersey Volunteers, New York Volunteers, 84th, De Lancey's, 3rd, and Marjoribanks. Hand-to-hand combat ensued when the Militia closed with the British Line. Some militia panicked while some held firm, able to fire 17 times, before ordered back and replaced by the North Carolina Continentals in a 'passage of lines\\". The North Carolina Continentals halted the British advance but were forced back by a British bayonet charge, only to reform and halt the British a second time. Greene then ordered the Maryland and Virginia Continentals forward in another passage of lines, forcing the British back towards their camp. However, two areas of British resistance remained, one under Maj. Henry Sheridan at the Brick House, which included a swivel gun, and another under Maj. Marjoribanks on the northern flank. Washington's cavalry tried to dislodge Marjoribanks, but Washington was unhorsed, wounded and taken prisoner, sitting out the remainder of the war. Marjoribanks then retreated towards the Brick House. The Brick House now became the focal point of the battle, and when an American artillery assault failed, the house gave the British a focal point to regroup, rally and reenter the battle. Maj. Majoribanks then attacked the American flank in the clearing before the house before he was mortally wounded. According to Stewart, the Americans \\"gave way in all quarters, leaving behind them two brass six pounders and upwards of two hundred killed on the field of action, and sixty prisoners, amongst whom was Colonel Washington, and from every information, about eight hundred wounded...\\" According to Otho Williams, some plundering of the British camp occurred, while an attack on the British left by Lee's cavalry failed. At this point, Greene ordered a retreat with all of the wounded. Greene's army was then able to march back to Burdell's Plantation in column formation, with a cavalry picket covering the orderly retreat. According to Greene, \\"Nothing but the brick house and their strong position at Eutaw's, hindered the remains of the British army from falling into our hands.\\" Casualties The British casualty return stated the loss as 85 killed, 351 wounded and 257 missing. However, Greene reported that he had captured 500 prisoners, including 70 wounded. When Stewart moved camp on September 9, he left 54 of his wounded behind with a surgeon to attend them. These men were included in Stewart's casualty report under the category \\"wounded\\" but the remaining 16 wounded captured by Greene would have been returned as \\"missing\\". The disparity between Stewart's report of 257 missing and Greene's figure of 500 prisoners may be due to Stewart regarding the capture of his foraging party as a separate engagement and not included in the British losses in his casualty return for the battle. Including the loss of the foraging party, and counting the 54 wounded men whom Stewart decided to leave behind on September 9 in the \\"wounded prisoners\\" category instead of as \\"wounded\\", this gives total British casualties of 85 killed, 297 wounded, 70 wounded prisoners and 430 other prisoners. There were three successive versions of the American casualty return. The first, compiled soon after the battle, gave 251 killed, 367 wounded and 74 missing.Lumpkin, pp. 304-305 The second, compiled somewhat later and published by the Continental Congress, reduced the losses to 138 killed, 375 wounded and 41 missing.Virtual War Museum: Battle of Eutaw Springs, September 8, 1781 The third and final revision, compiled on September 25, 1781, arrived at figures of 119 killed, 382 wounded and 78 missing. The British took 60 prisoners, including the wounded Colonel William Washington, and two artillery pieces. Aftermath Rain prevented a continuation of battle the next day. Instead, Stewart buried his dead, destroyed supplies, including 1000 muskets, and retreated towards Moncks Corner, leaving behind 70 wounded. Greene pursued Stewart as far as Martin's Tavern near Ferguson's Swamp. At this point, 11 Sept., Stewart was within range of support from the British garrison in Charleston. Stewart's letter to Cornwallis on 11 Sept. 1781 states, > With particular satisfaction I have the honour to inform your lordship, that > on the 8th instant I was attacked by the rebel General Greene, with all the > force he could collect in this province and North Carolina, and after an > obstinate engagement, which lasted near two hours, I totally defeated him, > and took two six pounders.\\" The British were forced to retreat to Charleston Greene's letter to Washington on 17 Sept. 1781 states, > Be far the most obstinate fight I ever saw. Victory was ours, and had it not > been for one of those little incidents which frequently happen in the > progress of war, we should have taken the whole British Army.\\" The claim of several historians that the British won the battle is challenged by Christine Swager in her book The Valiant Died: The Battle of Eutaw Springs September 8, 1781. The book argues that, first, at the end of the battle, the British held the majority, but not the entirety, of the field where the main battle took place. Greene held part of the field where the initial skirmish spilled out of the woods into the clearings. Swager also argues that Greene meant to re-engage the enemy on the following day, but was prevented from doing so because the excessively wet weather conditions negated much of his firepower. Neither army left the vicinity for at least a full day following the battle. When Greene withdrew, he left a strong picket to oppose a possible British advance, while Stewart withdrew the remnants of his force towards Charleston.Pancake, p. 221 His rear was apparently under constant fire at least until meeting with reinforcements near Moncks Corner. Present day view of the battlefield Despite winning a tactical victory, the British lost strategically. Their inability to stop Greene's continuing operations forced them to abandon most of their conquests in the South, leaving them in control of a small number of isolated enclaves at Wilmington, Charleston, and Savannah. The British attempt to pacify the South with Loyalist support had failed even before Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. Lord Edward Fitzgerald, later to become famous as a United Irish rebel, served as a British officer at the battle and was badly wounded. The Continental Congress awarded Greene a gold medal. The State Song of South Carolina contains the line \\"Point to Eutaw's Battle Bed\\" in reference to this battle.

The film stars Liam Aiken as Owen Baker, as well as the voices of Matthew Broderick, Delta Burke, Donald Faison, Brittany Murphy, Carl Reiner, Vanessa Redgrave, and Cheech Marin as the abundant dog characters in the film. Plot Owen Baker (Liam Aiken) is a 12-year-old who has been working as the neighborhood dog-walker so he can earn the privilege of getting a dog of his own. Owen's hard work pays off when his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Baker (Kevin Nealon and Molly Shannon), let Owen adopt a scruffy Border Terrier that he names Hubble (voice of Matthew Broderick). Owen has little time to make lasting friends, due to his parents' renovation and reselling of houses, so he hopes Hubble will be his best friend. Owen does have a friend named Connie Flemming (Brittany Moldowan), a girl his age who lives in the neighborhood, but he is also bullied by two boys named Frankie (Hunter Elliott) and Fred (Mikhael Speidel). Soon after the adoption of Hubble, Owen finds out that his new abnormally intelligent dog actually came from outer space. Owen wakes up the next morning to discover that he can now understand every word Hubble says‚Äîincluding the ominous phrase: \\"Take me to your leaders.\\" Owen learns that dogs came to Earth thousands of years ago to colonize and dominate the planet. Hubble, who is really named Canid 3942, has been sent by the powerful Greater Dane (voice of Vanessa Redgrave) on a mission from the Dog Star Sirius 7 to make sure dogs have fulfilled this destiny. The dogs Owen walks include pampered Poodle Barbara Ann (voiced by Delta Burke), rambunctious Boxer Wilson (voiced by Donald Faison), nervous Italian Greyhound Nelly (voiced by Brittany Murphy) and Connie's gassy Bernese Mountain Dog Shep (voiced by Carl Reiner). Despite the best efforts of Owen and this rag-tag group of neighborhood dogs to convince Hubble that everything is fine with Earth's dogs, Hubble soon discovers the awful truth about Earth dogs: \\"You're all pets!\\" Things get worse when Hubble learns that the Greater Dane is headed for Earth to do her own inspection. If things don't look right, all dogs on Earth will be recalled to Sirius. Owen and Hubble have to work together to prepare the neighborhood dogs for a visit from the Greater Dane and her Chinese Crested Dog henchman (voiced by Cheech Marin). Owen, Hubble, Connie, and their canine pals set out to whip the other dogs into shape so that they can pass muster. Owen's efforts fail and the Greater Dane recalls all dogs from Earth. Upset, Owen repairs Hubble's communicator and sends him a message declaring how much he loves him. The Greater Dane hears the message and is left curious by it so she approaches Hubble for his opinion on why the dogs on Earth are subservient to humanity when they should be ruling it. Hubble believes that the dogs and humans have formed a bond of love and loyalty. When asked where his own loyalty lies, Hubble asks the Greater Dane to refer to him as Hubble rather than Canid 3942, showing his bond with Owen. As a result, the Greater Dane sends the Earth dogs back and declares them a separate species. Hubble is allowed to return as well, but on the condition that he removes Owen's ability to communicate with dogs. Owen's parents choose to remain in town for once and Hubble starts to fit in as an Earth dog.

Sports. Retrieved February 18, 2016. He was known for his powerful dunks, which led to the NBA adopting breakaway rims due to him shattering a backboard on two occasions in 1979. Dawkins averaged double figures in scoring nine times in his 14 years in the NBA, often ranking among the league leaders in field-goal percentage. He also played in the NBA Finals three times as a member of the Philadelphia 76ers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Dawkins set an NBA record for fouls in a season (386 in 1983‚Äì84). NBA career As a 6'10 senior at Maynard Evans High School in Orlando, Florida, Dawkins averaged 32 points and 21 rebounds to lead his team to the state championship. He was heavily recruited by Division I colleges across the country, and he narrowed his choices to Florida State, Kansas, and Kentucky.Dawkins Does Not Regret Heading To Nba 25 Years Ago He Left Maynard Evans High School In 1975 To Help His Family Make It Through Financial Difficulties. In a surprise move, Dawkins opted to directly enter the NBA draft out of high school instead of attending college. He made this decision because he wanted to make enough money to help his grandmother, mother and siblings to escape poverty. He was the first player to enter the NBA immediately after high school. =Philadelphia 76ers= With the fifth overall pick in the 1975 NBA draft, the Philadelphia 76ers selected Dawkins. He was drafted behind David Thompson, David Meyers, Marvin Webster, and Alvan Adams. He signed a seven-year contract worth $1 million. Dawkins languished on the Sixers' bench for his first two seasons. In his second season, after playing limited minutes during the regular season, Dawkins was called upon to help the Sixers in their playoff run, to battle Dave Cowens of the Celtics and Moses Malone of the Rockets. The Sixers won both playoff series and advanced to the NBA Finals. Matched up against Portland's Bill Walton, Dawkins helped the Sixers take the first two games before the Trail Blazers won the next four to win the series in six games. In the second game of the series, Dawkins got into a fight with Maurice Lucas, resulting in both players being ejected. Dawkins took his anger out on the 76ers locker room by tearing a toilet out of the wall and dislodging a locker stall and barricading the door with it. Dawkins' role in helping the Sixers win the Eastern Conference championship established him as one of Philadelphia's top players, on a team that included Julius Erving, George McGinnis, Lloyd Free, and Doug Collins. Now 20 years old, Dawkins was averaging 11.7 points and 7.9 rebounds in nearly 25 minutes per game, while also ranked second in the league in field goal percentage at .575. For the second straight year, the Sixers earned the top seed in the Eastern Division and advanced to the conference finals, but they were defeated by the Washington Bullets in six games. Prior to the 1978‚Äì79 season Philadelphia traded McGinnis to the Denver Nuggets, clearing way for Dawkins to be a permanent front court starter. Over the next three seasons Dawkins and Caldwell Jones split time at the center and power forward positions. In 1979‚Äì80 he averaged 14.7 points and a career-high 8.7 rebounds, helping the Sixers back to the NBA Finals, which they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. In the 1981 season Dawkins produced a .607 field-goal percentage, second in the NBA to Artis Gilmore's .670. Dawkins averaged 14 points and 7.2 rebounds for the year, but Philadelphia failed to return to the Finals. The club met the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals and lost in seven games. The 76ers suffered another postseason disappointment in 1982 when they reached the Finals but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games. Frustrated with the team's inability to handle Lakers' center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sixers management traded Dawkins to the New Jersey Nets and Caldwell Jones to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Moses Malone, who helped Philadelphia win the NBA Championship the following year. =New Jersey Nets= Dawkins was traded to the Nets during the 1982 off-season in exchange for a first round draft pick.DAWKINS OF 76ERS TRADED TO NETS At age 25, Dawkins joined a Nets club that included Albert King, Buck Williams, and Otis Birdsong. His first two seasons with the Nets were successful for both sides, as Dawkins experienced a career renaissance of sortsPLAYERS; THE NEW, IMPROVED DAWKINS and the Nets had their most successful seasons to that point. In the 1982‚Äì83 season, Dawkins averaged 12 points and shot .599 from the floor, ranking third in the league in field-goal percentage.

The Nets playoff series win over the defending NBA champions was ranked as the seventh greatest playoff upset by Sports Illustrated. The Nets lost in the next round to the Milwaukee Bucks in six games. For the playoffs, Dawkins averaged 18.4 points. =Later career= With the Nets looking to be a team on the rise led by Dawkins, they entered the 1984‚Äì85 with high expectations. However injuries limited him to just 39 games. Dawkins appeared to return to form the following season averaging 15.3 points and shooting .644 from the floor, but an injury midway through the season kept him out of 31 of the team's final 32 games. He only played six games in the 1986-87 season, after a second back surgery in less than two years. Dawkins was traded to the Utah Jazz in a seven-player, three-team trade during the 1987 offseason.Utah Gets Dawkins and Turpin in a Three-Team Trade His tenure with Utah lasted just four games before the Jazz traded him to the Detroit Pistons for a pair of second round draft picks and an undisclosed amount of cash.Jazz Trade Dawkins For Piston Draft Picks Dawkins' personality was a natural fit on the \\"Bad Boys\\" Pistons team, and despite being limited to 14 games over two seasons, he was considered to be one of the leaders of the team. Dawkins was often inactive for games as he was still recovering from his back injuries and dealing with the death of his ex-wife. In his final season in the NBA, the Pistons won the NBA championship.When ‚ÄúChocolate Thunder‚Äù wore a Pistons uniform Dawkins received a training camp invitation from the Orlando Magic for their inaugural season in 1989,Magic Set 1st Game Pistons Will Be Foe In Arena On Oct. 13 but he opted to play in Italy. He spent several seasons in Italy, playing for Torino, Olimpia Milano and Telemarket Forli. He attempted a comeback in 1994, attending Denver Nuggets training camp, and again in 1995 with the Boston Celtics. Dawkins set an NBA record by committing 386 personal fouls during the 1983-1984 season. He committed one more personal foul during his career than Michael Jordan, despite playing nearly 350 fewer games.NBA & ABA Single Season Leaders and Records for Personal Fouls at basketball-reference.com =Signature dunking= In a game against the Kansas City Kings at Municipal Auditorium on November 13, 1979, Dawkins broke the backboard, sending the Kings' Bill Robinzine ducking. Three weeks later he did it again, this time at home against the San Antonio Spurs at the Spectrum. A few days after that the NBA created a new rule that breaking a backboard was an offense that would result in a fine and suspension. Dawkins named the first backboard-breaking dunk \\"The Chocolate-Thunder-Flying, Robinzine-Crying, Teeth-Shaking, Glass-Breaking, Rump-Roasting, Bun-Toasting, Wham-Bam, Glass- Breaker-I-Am-Jam.\\" He named other dunks as well: the Rim Wrecker, the Go- Rilla, the Look Out Below, the In-Your-Face Disgrace, the Cover Your Head, the Yo-Mama, the Spine-Chiller Supreme, and the Greyhound Special (for the rare occasions when he went coast to coast). The 76ers also kept a separate column on the stat sheet for Dawkins's self-created nicknames: \\"Sir Slam\\", \\"Dr. Dunkenstein\\", and \\"Chocolate Thunder.\\" Dawkins also wore gold chain necklaces during games until the end of the 1980 NBA Finals when the NBA banned players from wearing them on court. One gold chain had a cross while the other featured one of his nicknames \\"Sir Slam\\" in gold script. He also had a similar necklace that has another nickname \\"Dr. Dunk\\" in gold script. Sometimes, Dawkins would also shave his head and have it oiled along with wearing an earring. At one point, Dawkins claimed to be an alien from the planet Lovetron, where he spent the off-season practicing \\"interplanetary funkmanship\\" where his girlfriend Juicy Lucy lived. Stevie Wonder, who frequently attended Sixers games, gave Dawkins the nickname \\"Chocolate Thunder.\\"Stevie Wonder gave Darryl Dawkins his ‚ÄòChocolate Thunder‚Äô nickname Post-NBA career Following his NBA career, Dawkins had a brief stint with the Harlem Globetrotters, followed by a season spent with the Sioux Falls Skyforce of the Continental Basketball Association in the 1995‚Äì96 season. During this season, the Skyforce's games against the Florida Beach Dogs were broadcast nationally by ESPN, as the Beach Dogs included another former NBA player, Manute Bol. In 2005, Dawkins was one of several former NBA players to audition for an analyst position with ESPN, as part of the network's reality series Dream Job. He was the head coach of the American Basketball Association's Newark Express. He was also the player/coach of the Winnipeg Cyclone, a team in the short-lived International Basketball Association in 1999‚Äì2000. He was the head coach of the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Pennsylvania ValleyDawgs of the United States Basketball League until they folded. On August 20, 2009, Lehigh Carbon Community College (located in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania) announced that Dawkins would be the head coach of their men's basketball team for the upcoming 2009‚Äì2010 season. Other media On April 7, 1986, he appeared at WrestleMania II as a guest judge for a boxing match between Mr. T (with Joe Frazier, The Haiti Kid) versus Roddy Piper (with Bob Orton and Lou Duva). Dawkins appears in NBA Ballers and the NBA 2K video games as a reserve member of the 1980s Legends East Team. He also appears in NBA Live Mobile as a Legend based on his 1979‚Äì1980 season with the Sixers. Personal life Dawkins' autobiography Chocolate Thunder: The Uncensored Life and Times of Darryl Dawkins (co-authored with Charley Rosen)Chocolate Thunder profile at sportclassicbooks.com chronicles his on- and off-the-court life as an NBA star. In the book, Dawkins chronicled some of the racism he encountered during his NBA career, playing alongside 76ers superstar Julius Erving, and his off-the-court experiences with drugs, partying, and women. In September 1986, Dawkins eloped with Kelly Barnes of Trenton, New Jersey. The following autumn, the two were planning to divorce when she committed suicide on November 1, 1987, at her parents' home in New Jersey; Dawkins was in Utah with his team at the time. In 1988 Dawkins married a former Nets cheerleader, Robbin Thornton; they divorced after 10 years. Dawkins later remarried; he and his wife, Janice, had three children: Nick, Alexis, and Tabitha, a daughter from Janice's previous relationship who has Down syndrome. In 1999, Saturday Night Live named Dawkins the \\"Man of the Millennium\\" in a Weekend Update sketch.Weekend Update transcript, JT.org Dawkins died on August 27, 2015, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, at the age of 58. The Lehigh County coroner's office announced that an autopsy would be performed on August 27, but according to a statement released by Dawkins' family, the cause of death was a heart attack.

As a teenager, he served in the military force of the Confederate States of America in Texas, during the American Civil War. After the war, he settled in Texas, and became an activist for the rights of former slaves, and later a Republican official during Reconstruction. With his wife Lucy Parsons, he then moved to Chicago in 1873 and worked in newspapers. There he became interested in the rights of workers. In 1884, he began editing The Alarm newspaper. Parsons was one of four Chicago radical leaders controversially convicted of conspiracy and hanged following a bomb attack on police remembered as the Haymarket affair. Early years Albert Parsons was born June 20, 1848,There is a typographical error in the printed edition of Parsons' memoirs. See for an image of a page of Parsons' autobiography giving his birthdate as June 20 in his own hand. in Montgomery, Alabama, one of the ten children of the proprietor of a shoe and leather factory who had originally hailed from Maine.Albert R. Parsons, of Albert R. Parsons: With Brief History of the Labor Movement in America. Chicago: Lucy E. Parsons, 1889; pg. 6. Parsons claimed to be the scion of pioneer English immigrants, with \\"the first Parsons family\\" arriving at Narragansett Bay in what is now the state of Rhode Island in 1632.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pp. 6-7. One of the Tompkins on his mother's side was with George Washington in the American Revolution and fought at the Battle of Brandywine. He was also a descendant of Major General Samuel Holden Parsons of Massachusetts, another officer in the Revolution, as well as a Captain Parsons who received wounds at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Albert's parents both died when he was a small child, leaving the boy to be raised by his eldest brother, William Henry Parsons (1826‚Äì1907), who was married and the proprietor of a small newspaper in Tyler, Texas, the Tyler Telegraph.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pg. 7. In the middle of the 1850s, the family moved from Tyler to Johnson County, living on the frontier for three years. Thereafter, they moved again to the Texas Hill Country, establishing a farm in the valley of the Brazos River. In 1859, at the age of 11, Albert left his brother's household to go live with a sister in Waco, Texas. Parsons attended school for about a year before leaving to become an apprentice at the Galveston Daily News, a relationship that Parsons characterized as being \\"indentured\\" for seven years in order to learn the printers' trade. Civil War and Reconstruction Lucy Parsons, as she appeared in 1886. The coming of the American Civil War in 1861, or \\"the slave-holders' Rebellion,\\" as he later called it, led Parsons to leave what he described as the \\"printer's devil\\": the position of newsboy. At 13 years old, Parsons volunteered to fight for the forces of the Confederate States of America in an irregular unit known as the \\"Lone Star Greys.\\" Parsons' first military exploit was aboard the passenger steamer Morgan which ventured into the Gulf of Mexico to intercept and capture the forces of General David E. Twiggs, who had evacuated Texas en route to Washington, D.C.. Upon his return, Parsons sought to enlist in the regular Confederate States Army, an idea ridiculed by his employer and guardian at the time, publisher Willard Richardson of the Galveston Daily News.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pg. 8. Parsons left his job at the paper, joining an artillery company at a hastily constructed fort at Sabine Pass, Texas, where an elder brother was the captain of an infantry company. For a year, Parsons participated in military drill and served as a \\"powder monkey\\" for the cannoneers. Upon the expiration of his first enlistment, Parsons left Fort Sabine to join the cavalry unit of the brother who had previously brought him to Texas, the 12th Regiment of the Texas Cavalry, also known as \\"Parsons' Mounted Volunteers.\\" Albert Parsons was a member of the \\"McInoly Scouts\\" and saw battle during three separate campaigns. After the war, Parsons returned to Waco, Texas and traded his mule for of standing corn. He hired ex-slaves to help with the harvest and netted a sufficient sum from the sale of the crop to pay for six months' tuition at Waco University, today known as Baylor, a private Baptist college. After his time in college, Parsons left to take up the printing trade, first working in a printing office before launching his own newspaper, the Waco Spectator, in 1868.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pp. 8-9. In his paper, Parsons took the unpopular position of accepting the terms of surrender and Reconstruction measures aimed at securing the political rights of former slaves.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pg. 9. This proved to be a pivotal moment in the 20-year-old's life, as he later recalled in his memoirs: > I became a Republican,In the 19th Century the Republican Party was the > political party containing elements which favored a radical restructuring of > society, while the Democratic Party was the voice of established order, > particularly with respect to race relations in the South. In the 1890s the > political orientations of these two organizations flipped, with the > Republican Party becoming the voice of solid currency and the interests of > domestic manufacturers while the Democratic Party gradually became the voice > of the organized labor movement. and, of course, had to go into politics. I > incurred thereby the hate and contumely of many of my former army comrades, > neighbors, and the Ku Klux Klan. My political career was full of excitement > and danger. I took the stump to vindicate my convictions. The lately > enfranchised slaves over a large section of country came to know and idolize > me as their friend and defender, while on the other hand I was regarded as a > political heretic and traitor by many of my former associates. In this supercharged political atmosphere, Parsons' paper could not long survive and publication was soon terminated.No issues of the Waco Spectator are known to have survived. In 1869, Parsons got a job as a traveling correspondent and business agent for the Houston Daily Telegraph, during which time he met Lucy Ella Gonzales (or Waller), a woman of multi-ethnic heritage. The pair would marry in 1872 and Lucy Parsons would later become famous in her own right as a radical political activist.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pg. 10. In 1870, Parsons was the beneficiary of Republican political patronage when he was appointed Assistant Assessor of United States Internal Revenue under the administration of Ulysses S. Grant. He also worked as a secretary of the Texas State Senate before being appointed Chief Deputy Collector of United States Internal Revenue at Austin, Texas, a position which he held until 1873. In the summer of 1873, Parsons travelled extensively through the Midwestern United States as a representative of the Texas Agriculturalist, getting a broader view of the country, deciding to settle with his wife in Chicago. With his move to the metropolis, a new chapter of Parsons' life was begun. Chicago years =Socialist period (1874‚Äì1879)= Steel engraving of Albert R. Parsons used as a frontis piece for his 1889 memoir. In Chicago, Parsons obtained a job as a newspaper reporter for the Chicago Times. In 1874 Parsons became interested in the labor politics as a byproduct of grassroot efforts to force the Chicago Relief and Aid Society to account for millions of dollars of relief aid raised by the group on behalf of victims of the Great Chicago Fire of October 1871. Commercial newspapers came to the aid of the Relief and Aid Society, denouncing its working-class critics as, among other things, \\"Communists\\" ‚Äî a term given new currency after the rise and fall of the Paris Commune during the first half of 1871 ‚Äî prompting Parsons to begin to study the essence of the charges. Parsons later recalled that this study had convinced him that \\"the complaints of the working people against the society were just and proper\\" and led him to draw parallels between the treatment of poor people in both the urban North and the Reconstruction South. \\"It satisfied me there was a great fundamental wrong at work in society and in existing social and industrial arrangements,\\" he later declared. In 1875, Parsons left the Republican Party's orbit and joined the fledgling Social Democratic Party of America (SDP).Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, p. 11. Parsons attended the 2nd Convention of the SDP, held in Philadelphia from July 4‚Äì6, 1875, and was one of the group's leading English-speaking members in Chicago, joined by another able speaker, George A. Schilling.Morris Hillquit, The History of Socialism in the United States. New York: Funk and Wagnalls, 1903; p. 208. As an interested observer, Parsons attended the final convention of the National Labor Union (NLU), held in Pittsburgh in April 1876. At this convention the dying NLU divided, with its radical wing exiting to establish the Workingmen's Party of the United States ‚Äî a group that soon merged with the Social Democratic Party to which Parsons belonged. This organization would later rename itself the Socialist Labor Party of America at its December 1877 convention in Newark, New Jersey, which Parsons attended as a delegate.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, p. 15. Parsons was also elected as one of two Chicago delegates to the organization's 2nd national Convention, held in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, at the end of 1879.Socialistic Labor Party: Platform, Constitution and Resolutions, Together with a Condensed Report of the Proceedings of the National Convention Held at Allegheny, PA, December 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31, 1879, and January 1, 1880. Detroit, MI: Socialistic Labor Party: 1880; pg. 3. Parsons was also involved with the Knights of Labor during its embryonic period. He joined the Knights of Labor, known then as \\"The Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor,\\" on July 4, 1876, after having been invited to speak at a mass meeting of workers. Parsons remained a member of the order until his death more than a decade later. Not long after joining the Knights of Labor, Parsons and his friend George Schilling co-founded the first Chicago order of the Knights, later dubbed the \\"Old 400\\".James Green, Death in the Haymarket: A Story of Chicago, the First Labor Movement, and the Bombing That Divided Gilded Age America. New York: Pantheon Books, 2006; p. 9. In the fall of 1876, Parsons was nominated for Chicago City Alderman by the Workingmen's Party of the United States. He received an impressive one-sixth share of the vote.Samuel Bernstein, The First International in America. New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1965; p. 290. In the spring of 1877, the Workingmen's Party ran a full slate of candidates in Cook County, including Chicago. The organization elected three of its members to the Illinois State Legislature and one to the Illinois State Senate. In this election, Parsons ran for County Clerk of Cook County, narrowly losing but polling nearly 8,000 votes. In the course of his life, Parsons ran three times for Chicago City Alderman, twice for Cook County Clerk, and once for United States Congress. Parsons was one of the foremost speakers in the English language on behalf of the socialist cause in Chicago in the 1870s. In 1877 a Great Railroad Strike took place. On July 21, about a week after the beginning of the strike, Parsons was called upon to address a vast throng of perhaps 30,000 workers congregated at a mass meeting on Chicago's Market Street. Parsons gave a powerful speech to the assembled strikers and their friends on behalf of the Workingmen's Party ‚Äî an action that cost Parsons his job at the Times the next day. After being terminated in the morning, Parsons made his way to the offices of the leading German-language socialist newspaper, the Chicagoer Arbeiter-Zeitung (Chicago Workers' News). He was found there and escorted to Chicago City Hall, where he was ushered before the Chief of Police and about 30 of the city's \\"leading citizens\\". There Parsons was dressed down for about two hours, with the Chief of Police asking Parsons if he didn't \\"know better than to come here from Texas and incite the working people to insurrection.\\"Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, p. 12. Parsons disclaimed any such notion, noting that he had urged the workers not to strike but to go to the polls to elect new representatives. With the agitated worthies present in the room audibly muttering such sentiments as \\"Hang him\\" and \\"Lynch him,\\" the Chief of Police advised Parsons that his life was in danger and urged him to leave town. Parsons was allowed to leave, but he remained in Chicago despite the implied threat on his life. The afternoon Chicago papers trumpeted that \\"strike leader\\" Albert Parsons had been \\"arrested\\" that day ‚Äî neither of which things were true.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, p. 13. The Chicago strike of 1877 was ultimately violently repressed by the action of the police and militia. =Anarchist period (1880‚Äì1887)= Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.\\" At the turn of the decade, Albert Parsons withdrew from all participation in electoral politics. He later recalled his rationale in his memoirs, written shortly before his execution in 1887: > In 1880 I withdrew from all active participation in the political Labor > Party, having been convinced that the number of hours per day that the wage- > workers are compelled to work, together with the low wages they received, > amounted to their practical disfranchisement as voters.... My experience in > the Labor Party had also taught me that bribery, intimidation, duplicity, > corruption, and bulldozing grew out of the conditions which made the working > people poor and the idlers rich, and that consequently the ballot-box could > not be made an index to record the popular will until the existing debasing, > impoverishing, and enslaving industrial conditions were first > altered.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pg. 18. Parsons turned his activity to the growing movement to establish the 8-hour day. In January 1880, the Eight-Hour League of Chicago sent Parsons to a national conference in Washington, D.C., a gathering which launched a national lobbying movement aimed at coordinating efforts of labor organizations to win and enforce the 8-hour workday.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pp. 18-19. In 1881, with the membership of the Socialist Labor Party in precipitous decline, a new organization was established, the International Revolutionary Socialists. Parsons was a delegate to the founding convention of this group.Parsons, Life of Albert R. Parsons, pg. 19. Two years later he was also a delegate to the October 1883 convention in Pittsburgh which established the anarchist International Working People's Association, the organization to which he owed his political allegiance for the rest of his life. In the fall of 1884, Parsons launched a weekly anarchist newspaper in Chicago, The Alarm.The Alarm is available on microfilm in two different filmings, with one master negative held by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois and the other by the Wisconsin Historical Society in Madison. The first issue was dated October 4, 1884, and was produced in a press run of 15,000 copies.The Alarm, October 11, 1884, page 1, column 1. The publication was a 4-page broadsheet with a cover price of 5 cents. The Alarm listed the International Working People's Association as its publisher and touted itself as \\"A Socialistic Weekly\\" on its page 2 masthead.See, for example, Masthead, The Alarm, vol. 1, no. 5 (November 1, 1884), pg. 2, column 1. Despite his use of the erstwhile Marxist slogan on the front page, \\"Workingmen of All Countries, Unite!\\", Parsons' paper was unmistakably anarchist in content. Parsons wrote on the theme in a November 1884 issue: In the early months of 1886, the luck of the workers was rising as massive strikes were beginning to take place, crippling many industries into making concessions. Parsons called for a move to \\"Eight hours' work for ten hours' pay.\\" Workers in some industries were even beginning to get this. As May approached, so did the day designated as the official day to strike for the eight-hour work day. On May 1, 1886, Parsons, with his wife Lucy and two children, led 80,000 people down Michigan Avenue, in what is regarded as the first-ever May Day Parade, in support of the eight-hour work day. Over the next few days 340,000 laborers joined the strike. Parsons, amidst the May Day Strike, found himself called to Cincinnati, where 300,000 workers had struck that Saturday afternoon. On that Sunday he addressed the rally in Cincinnati of the news from the \\"storm center\\" of the strike and participated in a second huge parade, led by 200 members of The Cincinnati Rifle Union, with certainty that victory was at hand. The future looked bright, and many believed that they had finally accomplished what they had been trying to for so long. Haymarket Affair Albert Parsons (top left) and the six other prominent Chicago radicals initially condemned to death for the 1886 Haymarket bombing. Parsons addressed a rally at Haymarket Square on May 4. This rally was set up in protest of what happened a few days before. On May 1, 1886, the first May Day, a massive strike in support of the eight-hour work day occurred in Chicago. Two days later police fired on workers on strike at the huge McCormick Reaper Works, killing six. August Spies and others organized the rally at the Haymarket in protest of the police violence. Parsons originally declined to speak at the Haymarket fearing it would cause violence by holding the rally outdoors, but would change his mind during the rally and eventually showed up while Spies was speaking. The mayor of Chicago was even there and noticed that it was a peaceful gathering, but he left when it looked like it was going to rain. Worried about his children when the weather changed, Albert Parsons, Lizzie Holmes, his wife Lucy, and their children left for Zeph's Hall on Lake Street and were followed by several of the protesters. The event ended around 10 p.m. and at the end of the event, after Parsons had already left and as the audience was already drifting away, a large group of policemen came and forcefully told the crowd to disperse. At that point a bomb thrown into the square exploded, killing one policeman and wounding others. Gunfire erupted, resulting in 7 deaths and many others wounded. No one knew who threw the bomb but chaos emerged as police began firing into the crowd. Numerous protestors and policemen died, with most of the police receiving wounds from friendly fire. Parsons was drinking a schooner of beer at Zeph's Hall when he saw a flash and heard the explosion followed by gunfire. Authorities apprehended seven men in the days after the events in the Haymarket. These men were ones that had connections to the anarchist movement and many people thought them to be promoters of radical ideas, meaning that they could have been involved in a conspiracy. Parsons avoided arrest and moved to Waukesha, Wisconsin, where he remained until June 21; afterward, he turned himself in to stand in solidarity with his comrades. William Perkins Black, a corporate lawyer, led the defense, despite inevitably becoming ostracized from his peers and losing business for this choice. Witnesses testified that none of the eight threw the bomb. However, all were found guilty, and only Oscar Neebe was sentenced to 15 years in prison, while the rest of them were sentenced to death. Samuel Fielden and Michael Schwab asked for clemency and their sentences were commuted to life in prison on November 10, 1887, by Governor Richard James Oglesby, who would lose popularity for this decision. These three men received pardons from Illinois Governor John Peter Altgeld, securing their freedom from incarceration on June 26, 1893. In the week before his execution, The Alarm was published again for the first time since the Haymarket events, with a page 2 letter by Albert Parsons written from Prison Cell 29 on death row. In his communique, Parsons named Dyer D. Lum as his editorial successor and offered final advice to his supporters: On November 10, 1887, condemned prisoner Louis Lingg killed himself in his cell with a blasting cap hidden in a cigar. The next day, Parsons, August Spies, Adolph Fischer, and George Engel were executed by hanging. Parsons likely could have had his sentence commuted to life in prison rather than death, but he refused to write the letter asking the governor to do so, as this would be an admission of guilt. Parsons' final words on the gallows, recorded for posterity by Dyer D. Lum in The Alarm, were: \\"Will I be allowed to speak, oh men of America? Let me speak, Sheriff Matson! Let the voice of the people be heard! O‚Äî\\" But the signal was given and Parsons' words were cut short by the springing of the trap-door.\\"Day of Martyrdom,\\" The Alarm, vol. 1, no. 2 (November 19, 1887), pg. 1. Legacy Parsons was buried in the Waldheim Cemetery (now Forest Home Cemetery) in a plot marked since 1893 by the Haymarket Martyrs Monument, in Forest Park, Chicago. His wife, Lucy Parsons, was noteworthy in her own right. She was a feminist, journalist, and labor leader, and one of the founders of the Industrial Workers of the World.

It was created in the 1990s by Sidney Frank, who sold it in 2004 to Bacardi. The Ma√Ætre de Chais for Grey Goose is Fran√ßois Thibault, who developed the original recipe for the vodka in Cognac, France. Company history Grey Goose was created by Sidney Frank Importing Co (SFIC). Sidney Frank, founder/CEO of the company, developed the idea in the summer of 1997. The idea for Grey Goose was to develop a luxury vodka for the American marketplace. SFIC partnered with cognac producer Fran√ßois Thibault (a French Ma√Ætre de Chai, or, Cellar Master) in France in order to transition his skills from cognac to vodka production. The company selected France due to the country's culinary history and to differentiate itself from other vodkas produced in Eastern Europe. The water used to produce the vodka came from natural springs in France filtered through Champagne limestone, and made with locally produced French wheat. The company also developed its distinctive smoked glass bottle featuring French geese in flight, and delivered its product in wooden crates similar to wine. In 1998 Grey Goose was named the best-tasting vodka in the world by the Beverage Testing Institute. The company was eventually sold to Bacardi for a reported US$2.2 billion in 2004. That year Grey Goose was the best-selling premium brand vodka in the United States. The company sold more than 1.5 million cases that year. Product description The wheat used in the creation of Grey Goose vodka is grown in Picardy, France. Distilled in the same region, north and east of Paris, the distillate is then sent to Cognac, France, where it is blended with spring water and bottled. The wheat used in Grey Goose is soft winter wheat, sown in October and harvested in August, which provides it with four additional months of growth in comparison to summer wheat. The wheat sold to Grey Goose is categorized as \\"superior bread-making wheat\\", and wheat that is soft. Although made from wheat, as a distilled spirit, Grey Goose is gluten-free. The distillation process removes the gluten from the purified final product. Enzymes are used to break down the carbohydrates into fermentable sugars. The fermentation takes place continuously over six cascading tanks, producing a 20-proof beer. The wash is then distilled into spirit using a five-step process. The water used in the vodka comes from a natural spring 150 meters (500 feet) below the blending facility in Cognac, which is lined with limestone, providing calcium-rich spring water. That water is then filtered to remove impurities. After the filtration the vodka is bottled in a plant dedicated solely to bottling Grey Goose. Grey Goose vodka is bottled with a replaceable cork rather than a screw-top cap. Flavours Grey Goose is the first vodka to be produced in the Ma√Ætre de Chai tradition, which allows aromas to be produced in the distillation process specific to Grey Goose vodka. It is made from 100% French ingredients, including flavored versions of the vodka. For instance, Grey Goose La Poire was the result of Thibault's relationship with a Parisian pastry chef, whose pear tarte inspired the recipe for the new vodka flavor. Grey Goose Le Citron is a lemon-flavored vodka.

The need for farmers to predict seasonal events led to the development of calendars. However, the variability from year to year of seasonal events (due to climate change or just random variation) makes the seasonal year very hard to measure. This means that calendars are based on astronomical years (which are regular enough to be easily measured) as surrogates for the seasonal year. For example, the ancient Egyptians used the heliacal rising of Sirius to predict the flooding of the Nile. A study of temperature records over the past 300 years suggests that the seasonal year is governed by the anomalistic year rather than the tropical year. This suggestion is surprising because the seasons have been thought to be governed by the tilt of the Earth's axis (see Effect of sun angle on climate). The two types of years differ by a mere 4 days over 300 years, so Thompson's result may not be significant. However, the result is not unreasonable. The seasons can be considered to be an oscillating system driven by two inputs with slightly different frequencies: the total input of energy from the sun varies with the anomalistic year, while the distribution of this energy between the hemispheres varies with the tropical year. In other physical situations, oscillating systems driven by two similar frequencies can latch onto either one. One point that must be considered is that the oscillation arising from the tilt of the axis is much greater than that arising from the distance of the sun.

Also in the cast were Ann Sothern as one of their friends, and Vincent Price as a peripheral member of the former Russian aristocracy. The story is based on the play of the same name by David Berry.REVISITING BETTE DAVIS AND LILLIAN GISH: THE WHALES OF AUGUST ‚Äî‚Äî Leonard Maltin's Movie Crazy The film was shot on location on Maine's Cliff Island.Placating the Stars of 'Whales' - The New York Times The house still stands and is a popular subject of artists on the island. Ann Sothern earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 60th Academy Awards.1988Oscars.orgOlympia Dukakis Wins Supporting Actress: 1988 Oscars Plot The Whales of August tells the story of two elderly widowed sisters from Philadelphia, near the end of their lives, spending their annual summer in a seaside house in Maine. The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with. Tisha (Sothern) is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters' conversations and revelations. In prologue, actresses Margaret Ladd, Mary Steenburgen and Tisha Sterling (Sothern's real-life daughter) play respectively Libby, Sarah, and Tisha as young women. Cast Production The film's producer, Mike Kaplan, saw the play performed by the Trinity Repertory Company while he was visiting Rhode Island on family business. Kaplan, who had met Lillian Gish many years earlier when he was a publicist involved in The Comedians (1967), decided immediately that the role of Sarah Webber was a role that would introduce new generations of filmgoers to the great talent of the \\"First Lady of American Film\\", who had begun her film career in 1912. This was to be the final film role for the 93-year-old Gish; she died in 1993, less than six years after the film's release. As opposed to the original stage production, the film made it possible to showcase stars who were the age peers of the characters. Actors and actresses of a certain age and stature were contacted to see whether they were both interested in and physically capable of playing the roles. Many screen greats were approached to play a role but demurred because they suffered from various infirmities, including Shirley Booth, Barbara Stanwyck, Fred Astaire and Paul Henreid. Gish and Davis were somewhat infirm‚ÄîDavis recently had recovered from several strokes which inhibited movement on the left side of her body, and Gish was somewhat hard of hearing. Other greats turned down the producers' overtures for other reasons, including Joel McCrea, Frances Dee, Katharine Hepburn and John Gielgud. Even Davis and Gish turned down the parts more than once before being persuaded to star in the film. This film marks a reunion between Bette Davis and Vincent Price after 48 years, having last appeared on screen together in The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939). Gish and Davis did not get along during the filming. Davis demanded top billing on the picture‚Äîan act of commercial aggression that Gish found appalling. Gish remarked of it, \\"Oh dear, I just can't deal with that sort of thing. I don't care what they do with my name. If they leave it off, so much the better. It's the work I love, not the glory.\\" Davis got leftmost billing, which was considered optimal, with Gish's name slightly higher. Gish recalled that Davis rarely spoke to her or looked at her except when the script required. Though Gish was hurt, she was sympathetic due to Davis's illness. \\"That face! Have you ever seen such a tragic face? Poor woman! How she must be suffering! I don't think it's right to judge a person like that. We must bear and forbear.\\" For her part, Davis was frustrated with Gish's missing her cues: \\"Miss Gish was stone deaf. She couldn‚Äôt have heard the cues if I‚Äôd shouted them through a bullhorn.\\" However, Gish admitted she actually had little trouble hearing her cues, but invented a subtle version of the silent treatment due to Davis's mistreatment of her. When Davis spoke a line, Gish often would look puzzled and gently protest: \\"I just can't hear what she's saying.\\" Whereupon, while Davis sat seething, Anderson would repeat Davis's line in a ringing voice, and Gish instantly would pick up her cue and continue the scene. Berry, Lindsay Anderson (the director), the cinematographer, a location scout, and Kaplan traveled by water taxi to several islands in Casco Bay searching for a location that would provide the necessary ambiance and ocean vistas for the film. In the end, the film was shot on Cliff Island a few miles from the site of Berry's family cottage on Peaks Island, where, in fact, the characters and story were drawn. The film's premiere in New York City on October 14, 1987, Gish's 94th birthday, was followed a few weeks later by a premiere in Portland, Maine, which was attended by both Berry and Kaplan. Reception Reviews for The Whales of August were mixed to positive. The plot and script were seen as underwhelming, with its major redeeming quality being the performances of Gish, Davis and Sothern. On Rotten Tomatoes out of 10 critics, 60% of them gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.6 out of 10.The Whales of August (1987) at Rotten Tomatoes. Accessed from May 5, 2012. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Although the film starred two preeminent actresses in what was close to their final film roles, it was not a substantial commercial success domestically. Upon its release, it was widely tipped that either Davis or Gish would be rewarded, if not for their performances in this film then for their longevity, with Academy Award nominations, but neither actress was nominated.TCM.com Sothern received the only Academy Award nomination of her career (and the film's sole nomination), for Best Supporting Actress, and Gish received the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress. The film was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival, which Gish attended, and she got a 10-minute standing ovation.

D. Hyman, the daughter of actress Bette Davis. The book portrays Davis as a bullying, alcoholic mother, allegations which have been overwhelmingly denounced as false. Overview My Mother's Keeper is often compared to the 1978 book Mommie Dearest by Christina Crawford, the daughter of Joan Crawford. Published after Crawford's book, My Mother's Keeper depicts Davis as a self-centered, emotionally manipulative alcoholic. Unlike Crawford, Hyman does not accuse her mother of any physical abuse. Indeed, she claims Davis was a battered wife and says Davis's actor husband, Gary Merrill, was a violent alcoholic. Unlike Crawford's book, which was published after the death of its subject, Hyman's book and a sequel titled Narrow Is the Way were published during Davis' lifetime, affording Davis an opportunity to respond to their allegations. Davis tried unsuccessfully to block publication of Hyman's books. Reception Publication of My Mother's Keeper roused support for Davis, who months earlier had experienced a mastectomy, four strokes and a broken hip. Whereas Crawford's book has drawn mixed denial and vindication, Hyman's account, which Hyman has maintained, has drawn virtually no support from Davis's associates. They have claimed that Davis spoiled Hyman and that Hyman exaggerated and wrote out of context. Gary Merrill called Hyman's motivation \\"cruelty and greed\\".CNN interview.

Used for music, comedy, family entertainment and sport, the 12,500-seat facility is London's second-largest indoor arena after The O2 Arena, and the ninth-largest (as of August 2019) in the United Kingdom. History Empire Pool Wembley on the first day of the 1938 European Aquatics Championships. The Empire Pool (also known as Empire Pool and Sports Arena) was built for the 1934 British Empire Games at Wembley, by Arthur Elvin, and originally housed a swimming pool, as reflected by its name. The pool itself was last used for the 1948 Summer Olympics. The building is used for music, comedy, family entertainment and sport. It was designed by the engineer Sir Owen Williams, without the employment of an architect. Williams built a unique structure, with cantilevers meeting in the middle, thus avoiding the need for internal pillars. He also used high quality concrete, meaning that it has aged far better than many more recent concrete buildings. Work on the Empire Pool began in November 1933, and it was opened on 25 July 1934 by the Duke of Gloucester. At the time it had the largest span of any similar structure in the world. As with the Stadium, construction was supervised by R.J. Fowler, Wembley's chief building inspector. Elvin introduced ice hockey to the new Empire Pool in October 1934. In 1976, the Empire Pool was awarded Grade II Listed status, recognising it as a building of special architectural interest, technological innovation and virtuosity. On 1 February 1978, the Empire Pool was renamed Wembley Arena. When the venue was known as the Empire Pool, it hosted the annual NME Poll Winners Concerts during the mid-1960s. Audiences of 10,000 viewed acts like The Beatles (who performed there four times), T. Rex (whose Ringo Starr-directed documentary film Born to Boogie is centered on a 1972 concert at the Empire Pool); Genesis, David Bowie, Cliff Richard & The Shadows, The Monkees, The Hollies, Dusty Springfield, Joe Brown & the Bruvvers, The Rolling Stones, Bon Jovi, INXS, Pink Floyd, (who played there on their 1977 \\"In the Flesh\\" tour). The Eagles on their Hotel California 1978 tour, The Grateful Dead, Dire Straits, who played there on their \\"Brothers In Arms\\" tour in 1985 and \\"On Every Street\\" tour in 1991, Status Quo, The Who, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich, were among many others. The individual performances were then finished by a famous personality joining the respective performer on stage and presenting them with their award. The Beatles were presented with one of their awards by actor Roger Moore and Joe Brown was joined on stage by Roy Orbison, to present him with his own award. These ceremonies were filmed, recorded and later broadcast on television. =Renovation= The venue was renovated, along with Wembley Stadium, as part of the early-21st-century regeneration of the Wembley Park area. The arena was closed for fourteen months, starting February 2005, for a refurbishment costing ¬£35 million, with events moved to a neighbouring temporary 10,000-seat venue, the Wembley Arena Pavilion. The new arena opened to the public on 2 April 2006, with a concert by the English electronic-music band Depeche Mode. The temporary pavilion was moved to Attard, Malta, opening as the permanent Malta Fairs & Conventions Centre in December 2006. In September 2013, it was announced that AEG Facilities had signed a 15-year contract to operate the arena. The arena in SSE colours The building was renamed The SSE Arena on 1 June 2014 after energy company SSE plc bought the naming rights to the venue for 10 years. =Returning acts= The Grateful Dead have released recordings of complete shows from 7‚Äì8 April 1972 as part of Europe '72: The Complete Recordings.

Lord Armstrong and his wife, of the now-demolished Jesmond Dean (sic) house nearby, first laid out the park during the 1860s. The design is intended to reflect a rural setting, with woodland, crags, waterfalls and pools. Lord Armstrong gave the park to the people of Newcastle, and it is now owned by Newcastle City Council. The current Jesmond Dene House adjoining the dene was the mansion of Armstrong's business partner Andrew Noble. It is now a luxury hotel. The (now closed to road traffic) iron-constructed Armstrong Bridge spans the south end of the Dene and hosts Jesmond Food Market every first and third Saturday of the month. The building of a replacement road and tunnel, the Cradlewell By-pass, was the subject of a road protest camp around 1993, due to the destruction of many 200-year-old trees.Jesmond Dene, direct action road protest camp Alpaca examining the visitors to Pets' Corner Jesmond Dene contains a free-entry petting zoo known as \\"Pets' Corner\\", which has been a popular family attraction since the 1960s. Jesmond Dene is home to Newcastle's oldest religious building, St Mary's Chapel. The chapel, now in ruins, was once a site of much significance, attracting a great number of pilgrims. The park is supported by a group called 'Friends of Jesmond Dene' which provides funds for small projects to improve the park. There is also a group of Volunteer Rangers which carries out physical work tidying the paths, picking up litter, cutting back shrubs and other maintenance tasks. The dawn chorus of Jesmond Dene has been professionally recorded and has been used in various workplace and hospital rehabilitation facilities. In 2011, the field area and pets corner were redeveloped. The redevelopment included a new road and a bridge over the Ouseburn river. In 2012, during excessively wet weather, a landslide occurred on the east side of the Dene, near the Old Mill. The landslide covered several footpaths running along the hillside. The paths are currently still closed as the cost of re-opening them would be excessive. In July 2014, the Old Mill in the Dene was vandalised with graffiti tags, which has since been removed. On 1 April 2019, control and upkeep of Jesmond Dene, along with other Newcastle parks, was passed from Newcastle City Council to a newly created charitable trust, Urban Green Newcastle.

It also stars Bette Davis, John Mills, Leo McKern, Dorothy Tutin and Tim Roth. Murder with Mirrors is based on Agatha Christie's novel They Do It with Mirrors (1952), using the novel's American title. The novel has since been dramatized twice more on two separate Miss Marple television series: first with Joan Hickson on Miss Marple (1991) and then with Julia McKenzie on Agatha Christie's Marple (2010). Both of these used the novel's original title. Synopsis Miss Marple (Helen Hayes) is reunited with her old American friend Carrie Louise Serrocold (Bette Davis) from their days touring Italy as young ladies. Christian Gulbranson, Miss Marple's lawyer, persuades her to visit the estate of his step-mother, Carrie Louise. Carrie Louise's devoted husband Lewis has turned the manor house Stonygates into a halfway house for young criminals. He confides to Miss Marple that he suspects that someone is slowly poisoning Carrie Louise with arsenic. But then Christian Gulbranson is found murdered.

This format of website evolved from the much older Internet Oracle. The original progenitor of this type of site was the now- defunct Forum 2000. The Forum 2000 claimed to have run the site by means of artificial intelligence, and the personalities on the website were called SOMADs, or \\"State Of Mind Adjointness pairs\\". However, modern Q&A; sites usually dispose of this pretense, with the most extreme example being Jerk Squad!, in which the administrators of the site provide many of the answers. Description =Forum 2010= Initially something between a satire of and homage to the original Forum 2000, Forum 2010 made its debut on July 29, 2000. The site, which began as a college web project by Andrew Chinnici, used personas from regular patrons of the WTnet IRC channel #watertower in addition to \\"celebrity\\" personalities. A check of that site in May, 2012 took one to web host aspnix.com, whose online chat representative said could provide no further information about its client. =The Conversatron= The Conversatron, which began to take questions December 12, 1999 was first to break the Forum 2000's format. The Conversatron made it clear that the site was not run by artificial intelligence, and called the site's personalities \\"Askees\\", in contrast to the visitors, called \\"Askers\\". The Conversatron stated in a thread that it would be \\"going down for permanent maintenance\\" at some time in early 2005, but that it may be supplanted by something \\"different, but still the same.\\" Since that time, the site has been back and forth, sometimes being replaced with the cryptic message, \\"So, web huh.\\" =The True Meaning of Life= More commonly referred to by its acronym TMOL, the site was originally started in early 2000 as a version of Forum 2000 and The Conversatron, but one that focused on the idea that videogames reflected a deep, self-actualizing message that could improve one's life. The conceit of the site was that it evangelized this videogame-centric, pseudo-Buddhist philosophy via a \\"Virtual Meditation Chamber\\", where the site's visitors, or \\"Supplicants\\", would ask for the advice or the opinion of the \\"Gurus\\". Headed by the fictional \\"lead Guru wrangler\\", The Seeker, TMOL ran from July 2000 ‚Äì January 2004, and the best-of archive of this run is still available online. =The Hateatron and the Ministry of Misanthropy= The Hateatron went online January 15, 2002 at a time when many other Q&A; sites were springing up. The Hateatron ran on software written by its creator Safiire Arrowny and has gone through many different incarnations since its launch. The Hateatron's defining factor was that aside from just answering questions with its characters, known as \\"Haters,\\" it had a fully integrated forum called the User Owned or UO Forum. The evolution of this kind of forum was a fluke, and it turned into an extension of the Q&A; format. The Haters who answered questions on the front page now sprang to life inside the UO Forum, interacting with the users who had become active in the community. The Hateatron sported a community and readership of over 100 regular users, organized a yearly convention called Hateakon, and answered nearly 5000 questions. Some time in early 2005, the Q&A; portion of the Hateatron was dropped from the front page of the site for unpublicized reasons. The rest of the site has since been decommissioned, although it is still occasionally updated with bizarre messages. The Ministry of Misanthropy is the official successor to the Hateatron, launched July 26, 2005. The Ministry's administrator is one of the former Hateatron users, and many of the other users have also made the transition. =The Conversawang and Wangcode= Jason Nelson, creator of The Conversawang, released the PHP-based software used to run the site. The software, dubbed Wangcode, became open source under the GNU General Public License. Previously, the major impediment to creating a Q&A; website was that each site had its own unique, proprietary software. Once the code became available, numerous Q&A; sites sprouted up, many of them outliving the Conversawang. An example of a Wangcode-based site is Deuce Tre ‚Äì Conspiratron. Other Q&A; sites started out using Wangcode but ended up rewriting the entire back-end at one point or another. Jerk Squad launched an improved back-end in August 2004, though the code was not made publicly available. The back-end used for Ask Dr. Science, codenamed Beakertron was expected to be released under the GNU General Public License by its author, David Perry. However, several years have passed since its future availability was first announced. =QNA2K/QNA2K10= QNA2K began in 2000 as an homage to Conversatron and True Meaning of Life. It was updated until late 2002, and was removed from the internet when Yahoo! removed the Geocities portion of its webhosting. More recently, QNA2K10, a more modern interpretation of QNA2K, has taken its place.

Features are an indication that the area in which it was found has been interfered with in the past, usually by humans. Features are distinguished from artifacts in that they cannot be separated from their location without changing their form. Artifacts are portable, while features are non-portable. Features and artifacts differ from ecofacts. Ecofacts are natural remains, such as plants and animals.  Types of Features  Features are categorized by the time period, as either historic or prehistoric. Prehistoric archaeology refers to the time in history before human life was recorded or documented, while historic archaeology refers to the time period were there was a documented human past. In relation to site stratigraphy, features generally have a vertical characteristic, such as pits, walls, or ditches. On the contrary, elements that have horizontal characteristic, such as a layer, dump, or surface, is not a feature. General horizontal elements are part of the stratigraphic sequence. Features tend to have an intrusive characteristic or associated cuts. This is not definitive as surfaces can be referred to as features of a building and free standing structures with no construction cut can still be features. Middens (dump deposits) are also referred to as features due to their discrete boundaries. This is seen in comparison to leveling dumps, which stretch out over a substantial portion of a site. The concept of a feature is, to a certain degree, fuzzy, as it will change depending on the scale of excavation. Photographer takes a record shot of a horse burial in a Roman ditch re-cut. A re-cut is a type of feature.  Examples of Features  A saxon pit, another type of feature Features specific to certain architecture types or eras such as trilithon for the purposes of this article are not considered generic.

It was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 6 to 27 September 1986. The title The Mysterious Planet is not used on-screen and only appears in the serial's scripts with the four episodes that comprise the story being transmitted as The Trial of a Time Lord Parts One to Four. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is put on trial by his people, the Time Lords, and is accused of meddling in the affairs of the planet Earth far in the future, when it was renamed Ravolox and moved from its original location. Much of the story consists of video testimony presented by the prosecutor the Valeyard (Michael Jayston) of the Doctor attempting to stop the robot Drathro from causing an explosion that would threaten the entire universe. Plot Events of the serial are framed on an arcing plot that carries through the other three serials of the 23rd season. In this, the Sixth Doctor is forced to land the TARDIS aboard a Gallifreyan space station, where he is brought into a courtroom. The Inquisitor informs the Doctor he is on trial for conduct unbecoming a Time Lord; evidence will be presented by the Valeyard. The first evidence is shown through video footage, taken from the Matrix, of the Doctor's recent involvement in the planet Ravolox, where the Valeyard shows that the Doctor willingly became involved in the affairs of the planet. The Doctor denies these charges as the Valeyard brings them. After showing the video, the Valeyard affirms he has more evidence sufficient to call for the end of the Doctor's life. As shown by the court evidence, the Doctor and Peri land on Ravolox, both noting a similarity to Earth. The Doctor is aware that Ravolox was devastated by a fireball, according to official records, but the presence of flourishing plant life make him suspicious. As they walk, they are observed by Sabalom Glitz and Dibber, mercenaries on the planet attempting to destroy a \\"black light\\" generator in order to destroy the L3 robot deep underground that it powers. The Doctor and Peri find a tunnel and enter to find remains that appear to be that of the Marble Arch tube station on the London Underground Central line, piquing the Doctor's curiosity further. The Doctor wishes to proceed deeper, but Peri is worried and stays behind. Peri is soon captured by a local human tribe, led by Katryca, and brought to their camp. Katryca informs Peri that she will need to take many husbands for the tribe, and locks her away with Glitz and Dibber; the two were captured after approaching the tribe to try to convince them to let them destroy the generator, which the tribe has taken as a totem. The three manage to overpower the guards and escape, but not before planting a bomb on the black light generator. They are pursued by the tribe. The Doctor, in exploring the modern underground complex, is also captured by humans under watch by \\"the Immortal\\". He is brought before the Immortal, the L3 robot that Glitz is looking for. The robot calls itself Drathro, and is following its instructions to maintain the habitat of the underground system. Drathro orders the Doctor to make necessary repairs, but the Doctor manages to temporarily electrify the robot and make his escape. Drathro sends a service robot after the Doctor. Peri, Glitz, and Dibber eventually meet up with the Doctor back at the ruins of Marble Arch, trapped between the tribe and the service robot. However, the tribesmen disable the service robot and recapture the group including the Doctor. The Doctor tries to explain the nature of the tribe's totem, but Katryca is unimpressed and places them in a cell again. While there, Glitz confirms that Ravolox is actually Earth. Drathro reactivates the service robot and sends it into the tribe's village to recapture the Doctor, but the tribe is able to disable it again; Katryca decides they should attack Drathro's \\"castle\\" to steal its technology for itself. The Doctor and Peri use the opportunity to escape and re-enter the underground complex, aware that the black light generator is now severely damaged beyond repair, and if it should self-destruct, it could take the whole universe with it. Katryca and the tribe are easily defeated by Drathro. When the Doctor arrives, he attempts to plead for Drathro to shut himself down in order to disable the black light system, but Drathro refuses. Glitz, Dibber and Peri arrive after being detained by Drathro, and Glitz offers to take the robot aboard his ship, which has a functioning black light system. Drathro agrees, and departs with the mercenaries. The Doctor finds the black light system is already beginning to self-destruct, and reconfigures the system so that its explosion would be limited to the underground complex. The Doctor, Peri, and the other humans living underground escape in time. The remains of the tribe offer to take in those humans that were living underground, and the Doctor and Peri say their goodbyes. Production =Preproduction= In February 1985, the BBC announced that the planned twenty-third season of Doctor Who had been cancelled. After vocal protests by the press and Doctor Who fans (including a charity single, \\"Doctor in Distress\\"), the BBC announced that the programme was merely on \\"hiatus\\", and would return in September 1986. Several stories which had been planned or commissioned for the original Season 23 were abandoned in favour of an overarching \\"trial\\" theme, reflecting the fact that the programme itself was on trial at the BBC. This story was the last complete Doctor Who story written by Robert Holmes. Its plot is similar to Holmes' first contribution to Doctor Who, The Krotons. In both stories, an alien machine subjugates a humanoid civilisation and forces its brightest young people into its service. =Production= The opening model shot of the Time Lord Space Station where the trial is held throughout the season was the most expensive model shot from the classic series run (costing more than ¬£8,000). The sequence depicts the Time Lord Space Station orbiting in space then dragging the TARDIS inside via the use of a tractor beam. From this serial onwards, all location work would be recorded on Outside Broadcast (OB) tape instead of the usual 16mm film. This practice would continue until the end of the show in 1989. The only footage shot on film for this episode was the opening special effects shot of the TARDIS. The BBC had been encouraging the replacement of film cameras with OB cameras since the early 1980s on the grounds that they were cheaper, and mixed with studio-shot material better. John Nathan-Turner had actually wanted to switch to OB shooting as early as Peter Davison's first season in 1982, but met with resistance from the directors working on the show at the time, so was overruled. Roger Brierley, who voiced the role of Drathro, was originally supposed to wear the robot costume and physically play the role, but it was realised that the costume would not fit Brierley's 6'4\\" frame. Therefore, a special effects assistant, Paul McGuinness, who helped design the costume, was called in to physically play Drathro, while Brierley spoke his lines from off-camera. =Post- production= Dominic Glynn was hired to score the incidental music for The Mysterious Planet, then John Nathan-Turner offered him the chance to rearrange the opening title music. His new score for the opening theme was the shortest- lived, lasting for this season alone (not counting the unused 1973 version by Delia Derbyshire and Paddy Kingsland). =Cast notes= The actor playing Merdeen, Tom Chadbon, had previously appeared in the 1979 Fourth Doctor serial City of Death. =Reception= The serial generally receives a poor response, similar to the stories of this era. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was critical of the serial: \\"a dismal last gasp from ailing writer Robert Holmes. The travails of the Saxon-like Tribe of the Free and whey-faced tunnel- dwellers are totally unengaging. Lifeless characters, clumsy robots, flimsy cliffhangers, zero peril.\\" AV Club's Christopher Bahn said: \\"Mysterious Planet\\" never really takes off, laden down by the script, a lot of time wasted running around in the forest or down corridors, and some atrocious acting by some of the minor characters, particularly Joan Sims as Katryca, the Boadica- esque warrior queen who sounds like she's escaped from a community-theater Shakespeare in the Park production.\\" Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1987. =Home media= In October 1993, this story was released on VHS as part of the three-tape The Trial of a Time Lord set. It was released on DVD on 29 September 2008, similarly boxed with the other three stories of this season. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 129 on 11 December 2013.

They are used to measure the pulse duration of some ultrafast laser systems and for applications such as time-resolved spectroscopy and LIDAR. Operation A streak camera operates by Fourier transforming the time variations of a light pulse into a spatial profile on a detector, by causing a time-varying deflection of the light across the width of the detector. A light pulse enters the instrument through a narrow slit along one direction and gets deflected in the perpendicular direction so that photons that arrive first hit the detector at a different position compared to photons that arrive later. The resulting image forms a \\"streak\\" of light, from which the duration, and other temporal properties, of the light pulse can be inferred. Usually, in order to record periodic phenomena, a streak camera needs to be triggered accordingly, similarly to an oscilloscope. Mechanical types Mechanical streak cameras use a rotating mirror or moving slit system to deflect the light beam. They are limited in their maximum scan speed and thus temporal resolution. Optoelectronic type Optoelectronic streak cameras work by directing the light onto a photocathode, which when hit by photons produces electrons via the photoelectric effect. The electrons are accelerated in a cathode ray tube and pass through an electric field produced by a pair of plates, which deflects the electrons sideways. By modulating the electric potential between the plates, the electric field is quickly changed to give a time-varying deflection of the electrons, sweeping the electrons across a phosphor screen at the end of the tube. A linear detector, such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) array is used to measure the streak pattern on the screen, and thus the temporal profile of the light pulse. The time-resolution of the best optoelectronic streak cameras is around 180 femtoseconds. Akira Takahashi et al.: \\"New femtosecond streak camera with temporal resolution of 180 fs\\" Proc. SPIE 2116, Generation, Amplification, and Measurement of Ultrashort Laser Pulses, 275 (May 16, 1994); Measurement of pulses shorter than this duration requires other techniques such as optical autocorrelation and frequency- resolved optical gating (FROG). In December 2011, a team at MIT released images combining the use of a streak camera with repeated laser pulses to simulate a movie with a frame rate of one trillion frames per second. This was surpassed in 2020 by a team from Caltech that achieved frame rates of 70 trillion fps.

It is often abbreviated as CNT-FAI because of the close relationship between the two organizations. The FAI publishes the periodical Tierra y Libertad. The Iberian part of its name alludes to the purpose of unifying Spanish and Portuguese anarchists in a Pan-Iberian organization. The FAI meetings were attended by members of the Uni√£o Anarquista Portuguesa and the Confedera√ß√£o Geral do Trabalho (including the Zaragoza Congress of the CNT in 1936). It is still in operation today, and aligns itself with the International of Anarchist Federations (IAF-IFA). History It was founded in Valencia in 1927 (after a preliminary meeting the previous year in Marseille, France), to campaign for keeping the CNT on an anarchist path by challenging the bureaucracy of the CNT‚Äîwhich it viewed as having grown to become a mediating link between labor and capital, rather than a representative of the working class. This issue was becoming especially tense, as Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorial regime took over in Spain, and engineered a crackdown on labour movements. The disproportional hegemony which the FAI gained over CNT politics in the early 1930s led to confrontation with the less radical revolutionary syndicalist members. From 1931, in the first years of the Second Spanish Republic, possibilist union officials (the pro-Republican 'Treinta' and their followers) were systematically forced out of office or expelled, leading to the creation of anti-FAI opposition unions within the CNT in March 1933. The most moderate trade-unionists, under √Ångel Pesta√±a, were ultimately expelled, forming the Syndicalist Party in April 1934, and leaving the CNT leadership under firm FAI control by the time of the Spanish Civil War. Members of the FAI were at the forefront of the fight against Francisco Franco's forces during the Civil War, mainly in the Eastern Army (Ej√©rcito del Este). Since Franco's death, and Spain's transition to representative democracy, the FAI has continued to function. Though the organization shares members with the CNT, the FAI's membership is secret.Roca Mart√≠nez, p.116 See also *Anarchism in Spain *Anarchist Federation (France) *Argentine Libertarian Federation *Italian Anarchist Federation References Sources *Jason Garner, Goals and Means: Anarchism, Syndicalism and Internationalism in the Origins of the Federaci√≥n Anarquista Ib√©rica, AK Press, 2016, 362pp, *Stuart Christie, We, the anarchists!

It was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 4 to 25 October 1986. The title Mindwarp is not used on screen and appears only on the serial's scripts with the four episodes that comprise the story being transmitted as The Trial of a Time Lord Parts Five to Eight. This story marks the final appearance of Nicola Bryant as Peri Brown. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is put on trial by his people, the Time Lords, and is accused of meddling in the affairs of the planet Thoros Beta in the 24th century. Much of the story consists of a video testimony presented by the prosecutor - the Valeyard (Michael Jayston) - of the Doctor discovering the alien arms dealer Sil (Nabil Shaban) is looking for a way to prolong the life of Lord Kiv (Christopher Ryan) by transplanting Kiv's mind into another. Plot As with the other serials from Season 23, Mindwarp is framed by the trial of the Sixth Doctor, prosecuted by the Valeyard, accusing him of meddling in other species' affairs in a way unbecoming of a Time Lord. The Valeyard provides evidence to the presiding Inquisitor via a screen linked to the Matrix showing the details of the Doctor's actions on the planet Thoros Beta. The bulk of the episode centres on recorded narrative. As shown by the video, the Doctor and Peri arrive on Thoros Beta, the Doctor's curiosity piqued on the availability of advanced weaponry by the Warlords of Thordon. As they explore a cave system, the Doctor discovers Sil, an arms dealer for the Mentors that are supplying the weapons. Exploring further, they find that the scientist Crozier in Sil's employ is attempting to perfect the ability to transplant the brilliant mind of Kiv, Sil's superior, into another body to overcome Kiv's pending death. When discovered, the two make their escape with the warlord King Yrcanos, one of Crozier's test subjects. The Doctor, Peri, Yrcanos and his men plan an attack on Sil, but the Doctor betrays by abandoning them at the last minute and warns the Mentors, causing Peri and Yrcanos to flee in different directions. Peri happens across one of the Mentors' servant woman, and with her help, disguises herself to get close to the Doctor. The Doctor reveals Peri to the Mentors and requests he be allowed to interrogate her alone, a request Sil allows. Away from the others, the Doctor tells Peri his betrayal was all a ploy to learn more of Sil's plan, and has discovered that they will transplant Kiv's mind into his body if he does not cooperate. Crozier interrupts the interrogation, believing he can extract more information from Peri, but then Yrcanos arrives, ready to kill the Doctor. Peri stops Yrcanos, and together they escape, regrouping with Yrcanos' men. As Kiv's body is dying, Crozier is forced to transplant his brain with the Doctor's help into the body of one of the Mentors' servants, keeping the mind alive but affected by the simple thoughts of the former consciousness. Yrcanos, Peri, and his men launch another attack, this time on a weapons stash, but are stunned and captured. Sil and Crozier decide to use Peri as a more suitable body for Kiv's brain, despite the Doctor's objections. As the operation is being prepared, the Doctor sneaks away and frees Yrcanos, urging him on for Peri's safety. Peri is strapped down and gagged as the operation is prepared and Crozier gives the order for her head to be shaven. The Doctor attempts to return to save her but is suddenly drawn hypnotically into the TARDIS, which appears in the hallway; it is later revealed that he travelled directly to his trial from that point. Despite the Doctor claiming that the Time Lords' interference has put Peri's life in danger, the Valeyard rebuffs this, stating that the Doctor shouldn't have become involved in the first place, and Peri's life is the cost of his involvement. Events on Thoros Beta continue after the Doctor's removal, as it is shown that Ycranos was placed in a time bubble by the Time Lords to hold his arrival back at the lab until after Kiv's mind was successfully transplanted into Peri; when Yrcanos is freed of the bubble, he is distraught at the results of the operation, and fires wildly, killing Peri. The Valeyard insists that the interference of the Time Lords was to prevent a greater disaster befalling the universe due to the mistakes in the Doctor's actions. The Doctor insists that the present trial appears to be serving a greater cause, and resolves to determine what it is as the trial continues. Production =Music= Initially it was intended that the BBC Radiophonic Workshop would provide music scores for both this and the following segment of The Trial of a Time Lord; both were assigned to Malcolm Clarke to begin with, although Terror of the Vervoids was reassigned to Elizabeth Parker shortly afterwards. However, fellow Radiophonic Workshop composer Jonathan Gibbs left early in 1986 and was not replaced until the following year, leaving the other composers backlogged and with no one free to do the incidental music for Mindwarp. It was suggested that Dick Mills could provide both the music and sound effects, but John Nathan-Turner rejected this idea and instead hired film composer Richard Hartley to create the incidental music for this segment. It would be the only time that Hartley worked on the series. The original recordings of Hartley's score no longer exist in the BBC archives with the result that there was no isolated score included on the DVD release of this story. For the Blu-Ray release of Season 23, Richard Hartley, along with Mark Ayres re-recorded the entire score in order to present the serial in a new 5.1 mix. =Cast notes= Deep Roy, who had previously played Mr. Sin in The Talons of Weng-Chiang, has an uncredited role as the Posicarian delegate. Trevor Laird returned to Doctor Who in the Tenth Doctor era as Clive Jones, father of the Doctor's companion Martha Jones. Christopher Ryan returned in 2008 as Sontaran leader General Staal in \\"The Sontaran Stratagem\\" and \\"The Poison Sky\\", and in 2010 as another Sontaran, Commander Strak, in \\"The Pandorica Opens\\". Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Philip Martin, was published by Target Books in June 1989 and was the final segment of the Trial arc to be adapted. Martin's novelisation adds a joke ending that gives away the revelation regarding Peri's fate in The Ultimate Foe, suggesting an entirely different outcome for the character and for Yrcanos than is suggested in the serial. =Home media= In October 1993, this story was released on VHS as part of the three- tape The Trial of a Time Lord set. The Region 2 DVD was released on 29 September 2008, similarly boxed with the other three stories of this season. This serial was scheduled to be released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 130 on 25 December 2013.

It was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 1 to 22 November 1986. The title Terror of the Vervoids is never used on screen and was first used in relation to these episodes for the 1987 novelisation, with the four episodes that comprise the season being referred to as The Trial of a Time Lord Parts Nine to Twelve. This serial is the first appearance of Bonnie Langford as the companion Mel Bush. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is put on trial by his people, the Time Lords, and is accused of meddling in the affairs of other worlds. Much of the story consists of video testimony presented by the Doctor, his own defence, of his own future where the last of a race of plants called Vervoids on board a spaceliner in 2986 plot to wipe out all animal life on board for their own survival. Plot As with the other serials from Season 23, Terror of the Vervoids is framed by the trial of the Sixth Doctor, prosecuted by the Valeyard, accusing him of meddling in other species' affairs in a way unbecoming of a Time Lord. In his defence, the Doctor presents evidence through a screen linked to the Matrix, showing the details of his actions on the spaceliner Hyperion III in his own personal future. The bulk of the episode centres on recorded narrative. On the Hyperion III, an elderly man named Kimber thinks he recognises a fellow passenger as an investigator called Hallett. However, the passenger claims that he is a mineralogist called Grenville. A trio of scientist passengers - Professor Lasky and her colleagues Bruchner and Doland - are alarmed that Grenville might be an investigator. Edwardes, the communications officer, detects a craft close to the ship - the TARDIS - but is unable to get a reply. Suddenly, an unseen figure attacks him and injects him with a syringe, causing him to fall and die. He then uses the communication equipment to send a message to the TARDIS. On board, the Doctor and his new companion, Mel Bush, pick up a Mayday message. They materialise within the Hyperion III's cargo hold, are seized by guards, and are brought before Commodore Travers - whom the Doctor has met before. Travers denies sending a mayday signal, but wants the Doctor and Mel to remain on board. Travers hopes that the Doctor will find out who sent the fake mayday call. The Doctor is convinced that whoever sent the message wants him on board. Security officer Rudge takes Mel to the ship's gymnasium, where he shows her how to use the headphones and tape recordings to help her exercise. Doland informs Lasky that someone has broken into their Hydroponics centre. As they rush off to find Bruchner, Mel hears someone on her headphones, telling her to take the Doctor to Cabin 6. In the cargo hold, Lasky, Doland and Bruchner check the Hydroponics centre; the large pods inside are stable, but the Demeter seeds have been stolen from the small work cabin. At Cabin 6, the Doctor and Mel find the room has been wrecked and discover the silver Demeter seeds and a single boot. Rudge contacts Travers to inform him there has been an 'accident' in the waste disposal unit; someone has been thrown inside. All that is left is a boot matching the one found by the Doctor and Mel in Cabin 6. They learn that these belonged to Grenville, but the Doctor does not recognise the name. Mel departs to investigate the hydroponics centre alone. Mel enters the cargo hold, where she meets Edwardes. He agrees to show her the Hydroponics centre. It was set up for the journey specially for Lasky, Doland and Bruchner, and that only 'low spectrum' light is allowed inside to keep the pods dormant. When Edwardes tries to enter, he is electrocuted, creating bright sparks that activates the pods. Two guards arrive, and Mel tells them that Edwardes is dead. Later, Doland and Bruchner arrive to find that all the pods have been opened. Rudge brings the Doctor to the bridge to question Mel about being in the Hydroponics centre. Rudge then gets a message from the medical team that was sent down to the hold to collect Edwardes' body, claiming that neither Edwardes or the guard can be found. Travers decides to speed up their journey to Earth and has the ship's course altered. Three Mogarians express their concerns that this will take them close to the black hole of Tartarus, but Travers assures them that they will be within adequate safety margins. Later, one of the Mogarians collapses. The Doctor attempts to remove the figure's face plate, but the others protest that oxygen is lethal to a Mogarian. The Doctor believes it is not a Mogarian, and removes the face plate to reveal that it is Grenville. The Doctor, however, recognises the man as Hallett, an undercover investigator. When Kimber recalls recognising Hallett before, the Doctor guesses that Hallett has faked his death to avoid being discovered. Mel realises that the Demeter seeds left in the wrecked cabin were a clue to lead them to the Hydroponics centre. They look at the place, and the Doctor wonders what came out of the pods. Returning to the passenger quarters, they see Lasky leaving a guarded Isolation Room. The Doctor and Mel enter the room, where they find a half-human, half-plant hybrid strapped to a table. The creature implores them to stop Lasky, but Lasky, Bruchner and Doland sedate her. Doland tells the time travellers that the creature is his assistant, Ruth Baxter. During their experiments involving cross-fertilisation, pollen penetrated a scratch in Ruth's thumb, causing the resulting plant maturing process to partially transform her human body. They are taking her to Earth in the hope that they can reverse the infection. Mel hears a noise in the air conditioning ducts and overhears creatures planning to kill all the 'animal-kind' on the ship. As she listens, she is attacked and rendered unconscious. The murderer dumps her in a disposal trolley. The Doctor enters the gym and hears the recording, including her scream when she was attacked. The Doctor runs after the trolley and rescues her. Vervoids, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition. Bruchner is becoming increasingly hysterical about the situation with the Hydroponics centre, especially when Kimber disappears. It turns out that he, Edwardes and the missing guard have been killed by plant-like creatures called Vervoids - the creatures that came out of the pods when Edwardes was electrocuted. Lasky finds Bruchner burning the notes on their work in the Hydroponics centre's small work cabin, and tries unsuccessfully to reason with him. Bruchner knocks Lasky out, runs off and attacks a guard, taking his gun. He goes to the bridge, and forces Travers and the pilot to leave, then changes the course of the Hyperion to head into the black hole of Tartarus - planning to destroy the ship, and therefore kill the Vervoids. The Doctor, Lasky and Travers attempt to break into the bridge, but it is filled with marsh gas. This has been released into the bridge by the Vervoids, who learned that they are the only members of their species. Bruchner is killed by the gas, but the ship is still heading into the black hole. Rudge summons the two Mogarians, as they can breathe in the poisonous atmosphere. They direct the ship away from the black hole, but when it is safe, Rudge tells Travers that he and the Mogarians are taking over the ship. Mel warns Doland and Janet of the hijacking. Rudge tells the Doctor that the Mogarians are trying to regain the supply of metals stored in the vault. Rudge is taking the hijacking as a means of securing a \\"more comfortable retirement\\", as this Mogar-Earth journey was to be his last voyage as a security officer before being written off. On the bridge, an unknown assailant kills the Mogarians. Mel sneaks through the air ducts to let the Doctor know that the guards will attack the lounge. The Doctor believes this is too risky, and tells her to attack the bridge instead. When they arrive, they find the Mogarians dead, and take the face plates to prove to Rudge the hijack is over. Doland knocks the gun from Rudge's hands, and he runs into the corridors, but is killed by the Vervoids. The Doctor tells Travers about the stolen tape recording and requests permission to search the passenger cabins. While Mel checks Lasky's locker in the gym, the Doctor tells Doland that he thinks the traitor is either him or Lasky. After searching the professor's cabin, Doland suggests the cabinet in the Hydroponics centre work cabin. There, Doland reveals the tape is in his pocket, but that he has wiped it. Taking the Doctor's gun, Doland admits to the murders. Doland believes the Vervoids can be used as slave labor when brought to Earth. The Doctor has disarmed the gun, and Travers arrives and arrests Doland. However, he and his guard are attacked and killed by the Vervoids. The Doctor, Mel, Travers and Lasky meet to discuss the Vervoids. Lasky believes that something must have gone wrong with their DNA, but the Doctor tells them that the Vervoids' hostility towards them is instinctive: The Vervoids hate 'animal-kind' and kill for survival. Lasky realises that this is what made Bruchner so hysterical, and vows to help destroy the creatures. In the hydroponics centre, Lasky finds that the chemicals to create herbicide had been taken by the Vervoids. She, Mel and the Doctor are surrounded by the plants. Lasky tries to reason with them, but they kill her and take her body back to their lair. Escaping through the air ducts, Mel and the Doctor discover the pile of bodies. The Doctor has an idea that vionesium, the rare metal taken from Mogar stored in the ship's vault, would accelerate the Vervoids' life-cycle towards its natural end. Travers lowers the lighting and heating in the ship, forcing the Vervoids back to their lair, where the Doctor and Mel are waiting. They deploy the metal against the Vervoids, which causes the creatures' leaf-covered bodies to die. Having saved the survivors, the Doctor and Mel depart in the TARDIS. Back in the courtroom, the Inquisitor asks the Doctor if any of the Vervoids survived, and he informs her that none did; if even a leaf had survived and reached Earth, a Vervoid would have grown. Seizing on this, the Valeyard accuses the Doctor of committing genocide. Production =Preproduction= This story segment of Trial went through a number of commissions with writers including David Halliwell & Jack Trevor Story (working on separate but linked episodes), Christopher H. Bidmead and Peter J. Hammond, the creator of the cult science- fiction fantasy series Sapphire & Steel. Hammond's story outline, titled Paradise Five, was liked by script editor Eric Saward but disliked by producer John Nathan-Turner, who rejected it and commissioned Pip and Jane Baker to do the segment instead. Nathan-Turner also was displeased with the appearance of the Vervoids, likening them to labia. Hammond later wrote two episodes of the Doctor Who spin-off drama, Torchwood. Designed as a typical Agatha Christie murder mystery set on a space liner, the actual structure of the story (and its bubbly tone) are reminiscent of the series during Douglas Adams' tenure as script editor, during season seventeen. In the first episode, Professor Lasky is briefly seen reading a copy of Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. =Post-production= This serial marked the last time the BBC Radiophonic Workshop provided a music score for the series. Elizabeth Parker was initially assigned the episode, but some schedule shifts meant it ended up being done by Malcolm Clarke instead. Coincidentally, Clarke had done the Radiophonic Workshop's first Doctor Who score, for The Sea Devils. As no individual title was used onscreen or on the final scripts for this story, there has been some confusion over how to refer to the story. It was initially commissioned with the title of The Ultimate Foe. However this title was later given to the novelisation of the 13th and 14th parts of the season. Writers Pip and Jane Baker repeatedly referred to the story as The Vervoids in subsequent interviews, as have other production team members, but this title does not appear to exist on any contemporary documentation. When Target Books published Pip and Jane Baker's novelisation, it was under the title of Terror of the Vervoids, which is now generally used to refer to the story (see The Ultimate Foe). =Cast notes= Honor Blackman later played Anahita in the Fifth Doctor audio drama The Children of Seth. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Pip and Jane Baker, was published by Target Books in September 1987. =Home media= Terror of the Vervoids was released on VHS as part of the three-tape The Trial of a Time Lord set in October 1993. It was released on DVD in September 2008, again boxed with the other three stories of Season 23, and was released individually as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 131 on 8 January 2014. Season 23 was released on Blu-ray on 23 September, 2019; the release contained the broadcast version of the story, an extended cut of all four episodes and a \\"standalone edition\\".

This has led to much research and generalization. In particular there is an analog of the Chowla‚ÄìSelberg formula for p-adic numbers, involving a p-adic gamma function, called the Gross‚ÄìKoblitz formula. The Chowla‚ÄìSelberg formula gives a formula for a finite product of values of the eta functions.

He was first elected, as a member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, to represent the riding of Cumberland‚ÄîColchester in the 1988 election. In common with almost every other PC Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1993 election he lost his seat, in his case being defeated by Liberal candidate Dianne Brushett. In the 1997 election, he retook the seat, defeating Brushett, and represented it until April 30, 2009. In 2003, the PCs merged into the new Conservative Party. He was the deputy whip of the Official Opposition from 2004 until the 2006 election, and had served as the Conservative critic of Transport, International Trade, National Revenue, and Foreign Affairs in the past.

Historically within the West Riding of Yorkshire, it forms part of the City of Wakefield, and has a population of 13,311, increasing to 15,350 for the ward in the City of Wakefield Council at the 2011 Census. It was a one-industry town, where coal mining employed the vast majority of residents, and the closure of the pits during the 1980s led to huge levels of unemployment and deprivation in the area. Hemsworth, along with nearby villages such as Ackworth, Fitzwilliam, Havercroft, Ryhill, South Elmsall and South Kirkby was made into a special regeneration area, and fortunes have improved as a result. The Hemsworth constituency is famous for being the place where Labour votes were said to be \\"weighed rather than counted\\" during the 1960s and 1970s, but the town is not even so heavily Labour-voting as it once was. The town's Member of Parliament is Jon Trickett, a former leader of Leeds council. In May 2005, the Office for National Statistics estimated that unemployment in Hemsworth was just 2.8%. This marks progress from periods in the previous two decades when it could reach as high as 50%. The boating lake at Hemsworth Water Park Also in Hemsworth is the Hemsworth Water Park, situated on the outskirts of Hemsworth. Hemsworth Water Park has two lakes; the largest lake is available for pedalo rides and has a man-made sandy beach; the smallest lake is in a more secluded area to attract wildlife. Both lakes are stocked for fishing which is available all year round. There are also plenty of grassed areas for picnics and games. In the water park, there is also Playworld, an outdoor adventure playground, which is suitable for children of all ages with a tower slide, climbing frames, a toddlers' sandpit area and a miniature railway. A new kiosk and toilet facilities were opened in March 2006. New equipment was introduced in 2008. A new restaurant, which opened in 2011, is situated adjacent to the larger of the two fishing lakes, and serves hot and cold meals, drinks and snacks. The local newspaper for the area is the Hemsworth and South Elmsall Express, which gives local residents the ability to voice their opinions on local topical concerns, provides local, regional, nationwide and world news. Along with the neighbouring village of Kinsley it is mentioned in the Domesday Book which was commissioned in 1085 by William the Conqueror. The name in the Domesday Book is Hamelsworde being the 'worth' or enclosure of a possible Saxon, named Hamel. Hemsworth was used in an episode of the Top Gear series: Series 4 episode 2. Robert Holgate, a native of Hemsworth (1481?‚Äì1555) was consecrated Archbishop of York in January 1545. There are many different schools including Grove Lea Primary School, West End Academy, Sacred Hearts, St Helens Primary School and Hemsworth Arts and Community Academy.

Countries located at the Bight of Bonny are Nigeria (eastern coast), Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea (Bioko Island and R√≠o Muni), and Gabon (northern coast). The internationally unrecognized self-declared state of Ambazonia also borders the Bight of Biafra.Fonkeng, Primus. \\"Insecurity, Forced Migration, and Internally Displaced Persons along the Cameroon-Nigeria Border, 2003-2018.\\" (2019). History Travel via the Bight of Biafra is estimated to account for 13% (1.6 million) of the total number of enslaved people exported from the Western African coast. The Bight of Benin to the west is estimated to account for 17% while Central Africa to the south is estimated to account for up to 48%. By the middle of the eighteenth century, Bonny had emerged as the major slave trading port on the Bight of Biafra outpacing the earlier dominant slave ports at Elem Kalabari (also known then as New Calabar) and Old Calabar. These 3 ports together accounted for over 90% of the slave trade emanating from the Bight of Biafra. Between 1525 and 1859, the slave trade from the Bight of Biafra accounted for over two-thirds of slaves exported to the New World. In 1777, Portugal transferred control of Fernando Poo and Annobon to Spanish suzerainty thus introducing Spain into the early colonial history of the Bight of Biafra. In 1807, Great Britain made illegal the international trade in slaves, and the Royal Navy was deployed to forcibly prevent slavers from the United States, France, Spain, Portugal, Holland, West Africa and Arabia from plying their trade. On 30 June 1849, Britain established its military influence over the Bight of Biafra by building a naval base and consulate on the island of Fernando Po, under the authority of the British Consuls of the Bight of Benin: *May 1852‚Äî1853 Louis Fraser *1853‚ÄîApril 1859 Benjamin Campbell *April 1859‚Äî1860 George Brand *1860‚ÄîJanuary 1861 Henry Hand *January‚ÄîMay 1861 Henry Grant Foote *May‚Äî6 August 1861 William McCoskry (acting) On 6 August 1861, the Bight of Biafra and the neighboring Bight of Benin (under its own British consuls) became a united British consulate, again under British consuls: *1861‚ÄîDecember 1864 Richard Francis Burton *December 1864‚Äî1873 Charles Livingstone *1873‚Äî1878 George Hartley *1878‚Äî13 September 1879 David Hopkins *13 September 1879‚Äî5 June 1885 Edward Hyde Hewett. In 1967, the Eastern Region of Nigeria seceded from the Nigerian State and adopted the name of its coastline, the adjoining Bight of Biafra, becoming the newly independent Republic of Biafra. This independence was short-lived as the new state lost the ensuing Nigerian Civil War. In 1975, by decree, the Nigerian government changed the name of the Bight of Biafra to the Bight of Bonny.

The original Shockwave version launched in 2000 but went offline in early 2009. A successful crowdfunding campaign was launched in early 2013 on Kickstarter by some members of the original development team, who announced the re-release of the game as open-source in HTML5. The original date for the game's relaunch was September 2013, but was delayed. An open beta test, started on 30 July 2014, is currently underway. The gameplay is simple on its surface, but requires solid strategy to win consistently. The graphics are also simple, and were inspired by the work of \\"outsider artist\\" Henry Darger, illustrator Edward Gorey, Japanese anime, and early, 8-bit video games of the 1980s. The game, which was inspired in part by Lucasfilm's pioneering online role-playing game, Habitat, was designed to ignite community-building through chat both in the game and on its associate message boards. In a departure from the androcentric norm in video games, all of the players in Sissyfight were rendered female and nonsexual. Sissyfight is often cited as an early example of a web-based MMOG in gaming development and academic circles. Although each game session only contained three to six players at a time, the mechanics of \\"brownie points\\" and the robust community surrounding Sissyfight created a much more \\"massive\\" experience than most small-scale web games. Gameplay Three to six players ‚Äì called \\"sissies\\" ‚Äì can play in a single game with each player beginning a round with ten hearts, each heart representing one \\"self- esteem point\\". The turn-based game hides a player's moves from the other players while in-game chat bubbles may be used to create alliances and coordinate their moves collectively. With each round, players try to eliminate each other's self-esteem until only two (or occasionally one or none) are left standing and proclaimed the winners of that game on a classroom-style blackboard. The moves that a player can select in each round are: * Scratch: An attack which deals a -1 penalty to the defender. Can be countered with either a cower or a grab, and does double damage if the victim is being grabbed or licking a lolly. * Grab: A passive attack which prevents the defender from scratching, teasing, or licking. It also sometimes prevents other players from grabbing. A grab also acts as a 2x multiplier against a defender when she is also being scratched. * Tease: An attack entirely dependent on teamwork. A single-person tease (also called a \\"solo tease\\") is ineffective against a defender. However, for every cumulative teaser added, the defender receives 2 damage. For example, two teasers do 4 damage, three do 6 damage, four do 8 damage, and five can wipe out a player in the first round with 10 damage. A single grab will nullify a two-person tease. * Cower: A defensive move which can dodge a single scratch, grab, or tattle. Multiple cowers tried when there is no attack will receive a -1 penalty. * Lick Your Lolly: A high-risk defensive move which normally adds 2 hit points. Since the maximum number of self-esteem points in the game is 10, licking with either 9 or 10 points wastes a lolly. If an attacker scratches someone licking, the licker will choke and receive a -2 penalty instead. A lick can also be stopped (with no penalty) if the licker is grabbed. Teases do not interfere with licks, but if a licker receives enough damage to be defeated with a tease, the player will be defeated, regardless of whether or not the lick would have allowed the licker to survive the tease. Each player can lick a total of three times in a single game. * Tattle on Everyone: An attack which can potentially damage everyone else in the game. The tattle does 3 damage to anyone scratching, grabbing, teasing, or being grabbed or scratched. If two or more players tattle at the same time, the tattle backfires and does 3 damage to each tattler. A successful tattle can be dodged by a cower or a successful lick. Each player can tattle only twice in a single game. Failure to select a move before the timer reaches zero results in -1 self-esteem point as a penalty, thereby gradually eliminating those who do not decide in time. However, many players tease out consistently indecisive players. Additionally, if all the players make their decisions with more than 10 seconds left on the timer, the timer accelerates to a countdown from 10, ending the round early. =Cheating= Players found several ways to cheat in the game. Most often, two players resort to using a third-party instant messaging service in order to coordinate their moves outside of the in-game chat interface. Other players developed more sophisticated methods, including running multiple sessions of the game and creating secondary or unregistered accounts (\\"sock puppets\\" or \\"socks\\") to tilt a game's outcome in their favor. The Honor Code, Sissyfight's terms of service, strictly forbids these behaviors.honorcode With the 2014 revival of the game, multisessioning has become more difficult; guest accounts are no longer allowed, and the game can now detect multiple sessions within the same browser. =Game variations= Players invented their own game variations, with unique rules. For example, \\"Tease Tag\\" required everyone to tease, while \\"Tease The Slow\\" required everyone to tease the last person to make a move. Other variations included a \\"no cower\\" rule, which was faster- paced and concentrated more on offense. Since these variants were not hard- coded into the original game, some players did not follow the special rules. As a result, the other players themselves often enforced the rules themselves by teasing out the rulebreakers. The $25,000 \\"stretch goal\\" set by the development team for the 2013 Kickstarter campaign would have hard-coded some of these custom variations into the game. The funding ultimately fell short of meeting the stretch goal.sissyfight-2000-returns on kickstarter.com However, in November 2013, the developers announced they would include custom game variations to compensate for missing their September 2013 deadline.post on sissyfightboards.com The open beta test, running since 30 July 2014, includes settings for these custom game variations. The 2014 revival features these hard-coded variations which are specifically created through the \\"special\\" option. Players may create their own game with a definitive title and identifier, which will have certain rules and challenges the normal game mode doesn't use. Some modes will disable certain defensive moves like lolly licking and cowering, others will prevent tattling to slightly increase difficulty, and others will make the timer speed up. These can be combined to make rounds even more challenging. History Sissyfight was a surprise hit when it was launched in 2000. In 2001, it was a nominee for the Webby Awards in the Games category. However, Sissyfight suffered from a lack of promotion and development after Zapata Corporation, its parent company, closed down Word late 2000. Nonetheless, the community proved strong enough to sustain itself, with unpaid administrator RamonaQ and a handful of volunteer moderators managing the game and message boards. Gamelab, a game development company founded by Zimmerman with other members of the original Sissyfight team on staff including programmer Ranjit Bhatnagar and designer Naomi Clark, maintained and ran the Sissyfight servers through April 2009. Since its release, Sissyfight was consistently named a top internet game by online magazines and continued to remain popular among its regular players, even after the site became unavailable late April 2009. =Demise= On April 24, 2009, Sissyfight became unavailable. On April 28, 2009, long-time volunteer administrator RamonaQ announced on an unofficial message board that the site would not be returning anytime soon, as it was no longer being hosted.Some- very-sad-news on sissyfightschoolboard.yuku.com =Return of Sissyfight= On April 30, 2013, Zimmerman, Clark, and Bhatnagar announced a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter to revive Sissyfight.

Two closed beta tests for the Kickstarter backers and their friends were held on January 17, 2014 and January 26, 2014. Each session lasted approximately two hours.

Claire's starts piercing customers at the age of two months with their 8-week immunizations and does not pierce the cartilage of people under 13 years of age. Although the target customers are girls and young women, as fashion trends have changed, the place has become popular for young boys to get their ears pierced as well. Claire's carries its own range of perfumes and jewelry.  Asbestos recalls  Claire's have been subject to numerous cases of alleged \\"asbestos presence\\" in its products.

Claire's stated that the FDA had \\"mis-characterized fibers in the products as asbestos, in direct contradiction to established EPA and USP criterion for classifying asbestos fibers\\". On March 11, 2019, the FDA tested more Claire's products, indicating \\"the possible presence of asbestos\\". The effected products was sold between October 2016 to March 2019. In response to the FDA claim, Claire's stated they continue to have confidence in the safety of their products, however also issued a voluntary recall and advised consumers to discontinue use. On 30 May 2019, a JoJo Siwa Cosmetic Kit was voluntarily recalled due to the FDA warning consumers of \\"the possible presence of asbestos\\".

She was known for her role as Agatha Christie's Miss Marple in the television series Miss Marple. She also narrated a number of Miss Marple stories on audiobooks.  Biography  Born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, Hickson was a daughter of Edith Mary (n√©e Bogle) and Alfred Harold Hickson, a shoe manufacturer. Boarding at Oldfield School at Swanage in Dorset she went on to train at RADA in London. Making her stage debut in 1927, she worked for several years throughout the United Kingdom and achieved success playing comedic, often eccentric characters in London's West End, including the role of the cockney maid Ida in the original production of See How They Run, at the Q Theatre in 1944, and then at the Comedy Theatre in January 1945. She made her first film appearance in 1934. The numerous supporting roles of her career included several Carry On films including Sister in Carry On Nurse and Mrs May in Carry On Constable. In the 1940s she appeared on-stage in an Agatha Christie play, Appointment with Death, which was seen by Christie who wrote in a note to her, \\"I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple\\".Haining, Peter. Agatha Christie ‚Äì Murder in Four Acts (Page 140). 1990. Virgin Books. From 1963‚Äì66 she played Mrs. Peace, housekeeper to Reverend Stephen Young (played by Donald Sinden) in the highly rated TV series Our Man At St. Mark's. Hickson played the housekeeper in the Marple film Murder, She Said in 1961 (based on Agatha Christie's original novel 4.50 From Paddington), which starred Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple. From 1970‚Äì71, she played Mrs Pugsley in Bachelor Father. Hickson played Mrs Chambers in Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads? In 1986, she played the part of Mrs. Trellis in Clockwise. Her stage career included roles in No√´l Coward's Blithe Spirit, the Tony Hatch-Jackie Trent 1975 musical The Card, and Alan Ayckbourn's Bedroom Farce, for which she won a 1979 Tony Award for 'Best Featured Actress in a Play'. In 1980 she appeared in yet another Agatha Christie production, as Mrs. Rivington in Why Didn't They Ask Evans?. The BBC began filming the works of Agatha Christie in the mid 1980s, and were conscious of the criticism that had been levelled at the portrayal of Miss Marple given by Margaret Rutherford. In making a new series, the makers determined to remain faithful to the plotlines and locales of Christie's stories, and most importantly to represent Miss Marple as written. Hickson played the role in all 12 adaptations of the novels produced from 1984 to 1992, and received two BAFTA nominations for Best TV Actress, 1987 and 1988. When the OBE was bestowed on Hickson in June 1987, Queen Elizabeth II was reported to have said, \\"You play the part just as one envisages it.\\" When Hickson retired from the role, believing that she should stop while the programme was still at the peak of its popularity, she stated that she had no intention of retiring from acting altogether.

The Mousetrap opened in London's West End in 1952 and ran continuously until March 16, 2020, when the stage performances had to be discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The longest-running West End show, it has by far the longest initial run of any play in history, with its 27,500th performance taking place on 18 September 2018. The play has a twist ending, which the audience are traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the theatre. History The play began life as a short radio play written as a birthday present for Queen Mary, the consort of King George V. It was broadcast on 30 May 1947 under the name Three Blind Mice starring Barry Morse. The story drew from the real-life case of Dennis O'Neill, who died after he and his brother Terence suffered extreme abuse while in the foster care of a Shropshire farmer and his wife in 1945. The play is based on a short story, itself based on the radio play, but Christie asked that the story not be published as long as it ran as a play in the West End of London. The short story has still not been published within the United Kingdom but it has appeared in the United States in the 1950 collection Three Blind Mice and Other Stories. When she wrote the play, Christie gave the rights to her grandson Mathew Prichard as a birthday present. In the United Kingdom, only one production of the play in addition to the West End production can be performed annually,Haining, Peter. Agatha Christie ‚Äì Murder in Four Acts. (Page 23). Virgin Books, 1990. and under the contract terms of the play, no film adaptation can be produced until the West End production has been closed for at least six months. The play had to be renamed at the insistence of Emile Littler who had produced a play called Three Blind Mice in the West End before the Second World War.Saunders, Peter. The Mousetrap Man. (Page 118) Collins, 1972. The suggestion to call it The Mousetrap came from Christie's son-in-law, Anthony Hicks.Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 291) Collins, 1984 . In Shakespeare's play Hamlet, \\"The Mousetrap\\" is Hamlet's answer to Claudius's inquiry about the name of the play whose prologue and first scene the court has just observed (III, ii). The play is actually The Murder of Gonzago, but Hamlet answers metaphorically, since \\"the play's the thing\\" in which he intends to \\"catch the conscience of the king.\\" Three Blind Mice or its tune is heard a few times during the play. The play's longevity has ensured its popularity with tourists from around the world. In 1997, at the initiative of producer Stephen Waley- Cohen, the theatrical education charity Mousetrap Theatre Projects was launched, helping young people experience London's theatre.\\"Mousetrap Theatre Projects ‚Äì History\\", Mousetrap Theatre Projects, March 15, 2012. Retrieved 2012-12-01. The play's storyline is set at \\"the present\\", which presumably means England as it was around the time when the play came out in 1952, including postwar continuation of World War II rationing. Tom Stoppard's 1968 play The Real Inspector Hound parodies many elements of The Mousetrap, including the surprise ending. Theatrical performances Blue plaque on the front wall of St Martin's Theatre, Covent Garden, London As a stage play, The Mousetrap had its world premiere at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham on 6 October 1952. It was originally directed by Peter Cotes, elder brother of John and Roy Boulting, the film directors. Its pre-West End tour then took it to the New Theatre Oxford, the Manchester Opera House, the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool, the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, the Grand Theatre Leeds and the Alexandra Theatre in Birmingham before it began its run in London on 25 November 1952 at the Ambassadors Theatre. It ran at this theatre until Saturday, 23 March 1974 when it immediately transferred to the larger St Martin's Theatre, next door, where it reopened on Monday, 25 March thus keeping its \\"initial run\\" status. The London run has now exceeded 26,000 performances. The director of the play for many years has been David Turner. Christie herself did not expect The Mousetrap to run for such a long time. In her autobiography, she reports a conversation that she had with Peter Saunders: \\"Fourteen months I am going to give it\\", says Saunders. To which Christie replies, \\"It won't run that long. Eight months perhaps. Yes, I think eight months.\\" When it broke the record for the longest run of a play in the West End in September 1957, Christie received a mildly grudging telegram from fellow playwright No√´l Coward: \\"Much as it pains me I really must congratulate you ...\\" In 2011 (by which time The Mousetrap had been running for almost 59 years) this long-lost document was found by a Cotswold furniture maker who was renovating a bureau purchased by a client from the Christie estate.Antiques Trade Gazette, Issue 2003, 20 August 2001, page 14. Found with the telegram was a lingerie bill from 1952 for ¬£24.13s. 6d. The original West End cast included Richard Attenborough as Detective Sergeant Trotter and his wife Sheila Sim as Mollie Ralston. They took a 10% profit-participation in the production, which was paid for out of their combined weekly salary (\\"It proved to be the wisest business decision I've ever made ... but foolishly I sold some of my share to open a short-lived Mayfair restaurant called 'The Little Elephant' and later still, disposed of the remainder in order to keep Gandhi afloat.\\")Entirely Up To You, Darling by Diana Hawkins & Richard Attenborough; page 180; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. Since the retirement of Mysie Monte and David Raven, who each made history by remaining in the cast for more than 11 years, in their roles as Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf, the cast has been changed annually. The change usually occurs around late November around the anniversary of the play's opening, and was the initiative of Sir Peter Saunders, the original producer. There is a tradition of the retiring leading lady and the new leading lady cutting a \\"Mousetrap cake\\" together. The play has also made theatrical history by having an original \\"cast member\\" survive all the cast changes since its opening night. The late Deryck Guyler can still be heard, via a recording, reading the radio news bulletin in the play to this present day.

A staging at the Toronto Truck Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, that opened on 19 August 1977 became Canada's longest running show, before finally closing on 18 January 2004 after a run of twenty-six years and over 9,000 performances. On 18 November 2012, both the 25,000th performance and the 60th year of the production were marked by a special charity performance which featured Hugh Bonneville, Patrick Stewart, Julie Walters and Miranda Hart. The money raised by the performance went towards Mousetrap Theatre Projects. During the Diamond Anniversary year of Mousetrap a touring production visited regional theatres for the first time in its history, whilst the London run continued uninterrupted. The play has also been presented internationally, in 2013 in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, by the British Theatre Playhouse.

By tradition, at the end of each performance, audiences are asked not to reveal the identity of the killer to anyone outside the theatre, to ensure that the end of the play is not spoilt for future audiences. Christie was always upset by the plots of her works being revealed in reviews. In 2010, her grandson Mathew Prichard, who receives the royalties from the play, was \\"dismayed\\" to learn from The Independent that the ending to The Mousetrap was revealed online in the play's Wikipedia article. Duncan Leatherdale of BBC News contrasted the play to other works like Psycho and The Sixth Sense, where the plot twist has been revealed and became itself an element of popular culture.  Plot  The play is set in the Great Hall of Monkswell Manor, in what Christie described as \\"the present\\".Christie, Agatha. The Mousetrap and Other Plays. Signet, 2000. =Act I= Act I opens with the murder of a woman named Maureen Lyon, played out in sound only. The action then moves to Monkswell Manor, recently converted to a guesthouse and run by a young couple, Mollie and Giles Ralston. While waiting for the guests to arrive, Mollie listens to a radio report about the Lyon murder, which notes that police are looking for a man in a dark overcoat, observed near the scene. Their four guests arrive. Christopher Wren is an unkempt, flighty young man. Giles reacts strongly to Wren with instant dislike and Mollie with instinctual trust. Mrs Boyle and Major Metcalf then arrive together in a taxi from the station. Mrs Boyle complains about many things; Metcalf is an amiable ex- military man. Miss Casewell, a mannish young woman, is the last of the booked guests to arrive, before an unexpected fifth party appears. Identifying himself in a foreign accent as Mr Paravicini, he tells the Ralstons his car has overturned in a snowdrift. He remarks that the snow has blocked the roads and that the denizens of the house are trapped. Uneasy about Paravicini's manner, Mollie nevertheless places him in the last remaining room. The next afternoon the guest house proves to be snowed in, and the residents are restless. Mollie answers the telephone to Superintendent Hogben of the Berkshire Police. Hogben tells her that he is dispatching Sergeant Trotter to the guest house, and that the Ralstons must listen carefully to what Trotter has to tell them. The Ralstons wonder what they could have done to garner police attention. Trotter appears at the door on a pair of skis and Major Metcalf discovers that the phone has stopped working. Trotter explains he has been sent in regard to the murder of Maureen Lyon. In a story loosely based on the real Dennis O'Neill case, the dead woman and her husband had mistreated their three foster children, resulting in the death of the youngest. Both adults were imprisoned for their actions; the husband died in gaol, while the wife served her sentence and had been released, only to be found strangled. Police suspect the elder boy of the abused children, who would now be twenty- two, of being the killer. Trotter reveals that a notebook found at the murder scene contained the address of Monkswell Manor and the words \\"Three Blind Mice\\". A note reading \\"This is the First\\" was pinned to the woman's body. The police have sent Trotter to find out how the Ralstons' guesthouse is connected to the murder and whether the residents are in danger. Both Giles and Mollie deny a connection to the case, though Mollie is ill at ease answering Trotter's questions and quickly excuses herself. Trotter asks each of the guests to explain why they are at Monkswell Manor and any connection they have to the foster children. All five guests deny any personal knowledge of the case. While Trotter and Giles tour the house, Major Metcalf confronts Mrs Boyle, revealing that she was one of the magistrates who had assigned the children to the foster parents. Mrs Boyle acknowledges this but denies that she has any responsibility for what eventually happened to the children there. As the evening wears on, Giles and Mollie become suspicious of each other while the guests snipe at one another. Sergeant Trotter traces the phone wire to find out if it has been cut. Mrs Boyle wanders back into the now-empty room and listens to the radio. The opening notes of \\"Three Blind Mice\\" are heard whistled by an unknown party and Mrs Boyle responds without alarm, speaking to the person only she can see. Suddenly, the lights go out and a scuffle is heard. Moments later, Mollie walks into the room and turns on the lights, only to find Mrs Boyle dead on the floor. =Act II= Ten minutes after Mollie finds Mrs Boyle dead of strangulation, Sergeant Trotter takes charge of the household. All the remaining residents are gathered in one room as he attempts to sort out the events of the evening. A shaken Mollie Ralston cannot provide him with any useful clues; the only thing she is sure she observed was the radio blaring. Frustrated, Trotter points out that their lives continue to be in danger; a third murder could very well happen, given the notes left with Maureen Lyon. He insists that everyone tell him where they were when Mrs Boyle was murdered. As each person recounts his or her whereabouts, Trotter takes them to account for inconsistencies or weaknesses in their stories. Finally, he declares that everyone in the house had the opportunity to commit the murder, since each of them was alone at the time. Giles counters that while seven people in the house lack alibis, only one fits the description of the man the police suspect to be the murderer: Christopher Wren. Wren insists that it is all a frame-up, and Trotter acknowledges that he lacks any evidence pointing to Wren in particular. Mollie later pulls Trotter aside; Trotter says that while the police suspect the elder boy to be the killer, the dead boy also had relatives and loved ones who might be interested in revenge: the children's father, an army sergeant, for example; or the dead boy's sister, who would now be a young woman. Trotter notes that Metcalf or Paravicini could be the father, Miss Casewell or Mollie could be the sister, and Giles could be the elder boy. Mollie, aghast, objects to the notion that either she or Giles could be a murderer, but Trotter forces her to admit that they know little about each other's pasts. Mollie soon finds herself in conversation with Christopher Wren, who confesses that he is actually an army deserter hiding from his past under a false name. Mollie acknowledges that she, too, is running away from her past. Despite the trust Christopher and Mollie are forming, he and Giles each suspect the other and nearly come to blows over Mollie. The situation is only defused by the arrival of Paravicini, who tells the company that Trotter's skis are missing. Trotter again calls an assembly of the household, declaring that he now intends to check the alibis everyone provided to him after Mrs Boyle's murder. They will re-enact the murder, with each member of the household acting out another's alibi. Trotter's hope is that while most of the alibis will be verified, one will be proved impossible. Each person is to go to his or her assigned position and stay there until summoned back by Trotter. The household obediently disperses, leaving Trotter alone onstage. = Identity of the murderer = After the role-players scatter, Trotter sits for a moment before calling for Mollie. He tells her that she has risked extreme danger by not identifying herself to him; he now knows that she was once the schoolteacher of the doomed Corrigan children. She failed to answer a letter the younger boy sent her at the time, begging to be rescued from the farm. Mollie protests that she had been seriously ill when the letter arrived and was unable to even read it until well after the boy was dead. To this day, she says, she is haunted by her failure to help the children out of their circumstances. Trotter takes a gun out of his pocket and points it at Mollie, telling her that though she assumed he was a policeman, she only believed that because he had rung up beforehand, playing the role of his own superintendent. Trotter is, in fact, Georgie, the elder Corrigan brother, and he intends to take his revenge on Mollie. Falling back into the demeanour of a wounded child who never grew up, he drops his gun and begins to strangle her, but is stopped by the sudden appearance of Miss Casewell. Casewell calls him by name and reveals that she is Kathy, his long-lost sister, come to take him somewhere safe. Major Metcalf, who accompanied Miss Casewell into the room, summons Giles and tells the frightened innkeepers that he had known all along that Trotter was not a policeman ‚Äì because Metcalf himself is a policeman, having arranged to switch places with the real Major Metcalf after discovering the \\"Three Blind Mice\\" notebook on Maureen Lyon. Critical reception The play made little stir in the review pages of the British press when it opened. The Manchester Guardian commented that it was \\"a middling piece\\" with \\"less in it than meets the eye ... Coincidence is stretched unreasonably.\\" The critic commented that the characters were \\"built entirely of clich√©s\\".\\"'The Mousetrap': New Comedy-Thriller by Agatha Christie\\", The Manchester Guardian, 27 November 1952, p. 3 The reviewer in The Times was more favourably disposed to the characters, calling them \\"nicely assorted, individually labelled and readily identified\\", and found the plot \\"elaborately skilful.\\"\\"Ambassadors Theatre\\", The Times, 26 November 1952, p. 12 In The Daily Express John Barber praised \\"the atmosphere of shuddering suspense\\" but thought some of the characters \\"too obvious by half\\".Barber, John. \\"Who Instead of How\\", The Daily Express, 26 November 1952, p. 3 In The Illustrated London News, J. C. Trewin commented that those who failed to spot the killer would probably call the plot \\"preposterous and over-burdened\\", but those who succeeded might be more kindly disposed.Trewin, J. C. \\"The World of the Theatre ‚Äì The Plots Thicken\\", The Illustrated London News, 20 December 1952, p. 1044 Publication history The play was published as a paperback by Samuel French Ltd as French's Acting Edition No. 153 in 1954 and is still in print. It was first published in hardback in The Mousetrap and Other Plays by G. P. Putnam's Sons in 1978 (). Film versions In 1959 it was announced that Edward Small, who had produced Witness for the Prosecution for the screen, was to make a film version of the play in co-production with Victor Saville for United Artists. Tyrone Power and Maria Schell were named as leads. However, no film version resulted. In 1960, the Bengali author Premendra Mitra directed a film Chupi Chupi Aashey, based on the radio play and short story. This uncredited adaptation is possibly the only notable film version of The Mousetrap. In 1990, Russian director Samson Samsonov made a movie entitled \\"–ú—ã—à–µ–ª–æ–≤–∫–∞\\" (\\"Myshelovka\\", \\"The Mousetrap\\") at Mosfilm. The script by Vladimir Basov is based on Christie's play.

It is so named as it is heard in the opening phrase of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde as part of the leitmotif relating to Tristan. Background The notes of the Tristan chord are not unusual; they could be respelled enharmonically to form a common half-diminished seventh chord. What distinguishes the chord is its unusual relationship to the implied key of its surroundings. : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 \\\\voiceOne \\\\partial8 r8 R2. \\\\once \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red gis4.->(~ gis4 a8 ais8-> b4~ b8) r r } ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4.5 \\\\once \\\\override DynamicText.X-offset = #-5 \\\\voiceTwo \\\\partial8 a\\\\pp( f'4.~\\\\< f4 e8 \\\\once \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red dis2.)(\\\\> d!4.)~\\\\p d8 r r } >> ew Staff << \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key a \\\\minor \\\\time 6/8 \\\\partial8 r8 R2. \\\\once \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red 2.( 4.)~ 8 r r } >> >> } This motif also appears in measures 6, 10, and 12, several times later in the work, and at the end of the last act. Martin Vogel points out the \\"chord\\" in earlier works by Guillaume de Machaut, Carlo Gesualdo, J.S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, or Louis Spohr (, cited in ) as in the following example from the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 18: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4 \\\\stemUp ces8.^( f,16) f4 r4 ces'8.^( f,16) f4 r4 ^.^(\\\\< ^. ^.)\\\\\\\\! \\\\once \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red aes2. } ew Voice \\\\relative c' { \\\\stemDown 2 s4 2 s4 s2. \\\\once \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red es2_(\\\\> d4)\\\\\\\\! } >> ew Staff << \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key es \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 2 r4 2 r4 4_._( _. _.) \\\\once \\\\override NoteHead.color = #red 2\\\\. } >> >> } The chord is found in several works by Chopin, from as early as 1828, in the Sonata in C minor, Op. 4 and his Scherzo No. 1, composed in 1830 Walker, A. (2018, p.187-8), Chopin, a Life and Times. London, Faber. . It is only in late works where tonal ambiguities similar to Wagner's arise, as in the Prelude in A minor, Op. 28, No. 2, and the posthumously published Mazurka in F minor, Op. 68, No. 4 . The Tristan chord's significance is in its move away from traditional tonal harmony, and even toward atonality. With this chord, Wagner actually provoked the sound or structure of musical harmony to become more predominant than its function, a notion that was soon explored by Debussy and others. In the words of Robert Erickson, \\"The Tristan chord is, among other things, an identifiable sound, an entity beyond its functional qualities in a tonal organization\\" . Analysis Much has been written about the Tristan chord's possible harmonic functions or voice leading and the motif has been interpreted in various ways. Though enharmonically equivalent to the half-diminished seventh chord F7 (F‚ÄìA‚ÄìC‚ÄìE), the Tristan chord can also be interpreted in many ways. , distinguishes between functional and nonfunctional analyses of the chord. =Functional analyses= Functional analyses have interpreted the chord's root on different scale degrees, in A minor: *The root is the fourth scale degree, IV. Arend interprets it as \\"a modified minor seventh chord\\" () :: F‚ÄìB‚ÄìD‚ÄìG ‚Üí F‚ÄìC‚ÄìE‚ÄìA ‚Üí F‚ÄìB‚ÄìD‚ÄìA = D‚ÄìF‚ÄìA :while Alfred Lorenz and others, interpret it as an augmented sixth chord F‚ÄìA‚ÄìD (, , , ) based after Riemann on the transcendent principle that there are only three functions: tonic, predominant, and dominant. *The root is the second degree, II (, , , ). These theorists interpret the chord as a French sixth chord (F‚ÄìA‚ÄìB‚ÄìD), based on the transcendent principle of closeness on the circle of fifths with IV being farther than II, with G seen as an accented passing tone. *The chord is a secondary dominant, V/V, and thus also with a root on B (, , , , , ). This favors the fifth motion from B to E, seeing the chord as a seventh chord with lowered fifth (B‚ÄìD(D)‚ÄìF‚ÄìA). Vincent analyses the chord as a IV chord after Riemann's transcendent principle (as phrased by Serge Gut : \\"the most classic succession in the world: Tonic, Predominant, Dominant\\" ) and rejects the idea of an added \\"lowered seventh\\", eliminates \\"all artificial, dissonant notes, arising solely from the melodic motion of the voices, and therefore foreign to the chord,\\" finding that the Tristan chord is \\"no more than a predominant in the key of A, collapsed in upon itself melodically, the harmonic progression represented thus: : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 2\\\\. } >> ew Staff << \\\\relative c { \\\\clef bass \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 2._\\\\markup { \\\\concat { \\"IV\\" \\\\raise #1 \\\\small \\"6\\" \\\\hspace #3.5 \\"V\\" } } } >> >> } , independently, sees the G as an appoggiatura to A, describing that According to Jacques , discussing and , cited in , \\"it is rooted in a simple dominant chord of A minor [E major], which includes two appoggiaturas resolved in the normal way\\". Thus, in this view it is not a chord but an anticipation of the dominant chord in measure three. Chailley did once write: =Nonfunctional analyses= Nonfunctional analyses are based on structure (rather than function), and are characterized as vertical characterizations or linear analyses. Vertical characterizations include interpreting the chord's root as on the seventh degree (VII) (, ), of F minor (, ). Linear analyses include that of and Schenker was the first to analyze the motif entirely through melodic concerns. Schenker and later Mitchell compare the Tristan chord to a dissonant contrapuntal gesture from the E minor fugue of The Well- Tempered Clavier, Book I (cf. ). William Mitchell, viewing the Tristan chord from a Schenkerian perspective, does not see the G as an appoggiatura because the melodic line (G‚ÄìA‚ÄìA‚ÄìB) ascends to B, making the A a passing note. This ascent by minor third is mirrored by the descending line (F‚ÄìE‚ÄìD‚ÄìD), a descent by minor third, making the D, like A, an appoggiatura. This makes the chord a diminished seventh chord (G‚ÄìB‚ÄìD‚ÄìF). Serge , argues that, \\"if one focuses essentially on melodic motion, one sees how its dynamic force creates a sense of an appoggiatura each time, that is, at the beginning of each measure, creating a mood both feverish and tense ... thus in the soprano motif, the G and the A are heard as appoggiaturas, as the F and D in the initial motif.\\" The chord is thus a minor chord with an added sixth (D‚ÄìF‚ÄìA‚ÄìB) on the fourth degree (IV), though it is engendered by melodic waves. Allen first identifies the chord as an atonal set, 4‚Äì27 (half-diminished seventh chord), then \\"elect[s] to place that consideration in a secondary, even tertiary position compared to the most dynamic aspect of the opening music, which is clearly the large-scale ascending motion that develops in the upper voice, in its entirety a linear projection of the Tristan Chord transposed to level three, g‚Ä≤‚Äìb‚Ä≤‚Äìd‚Ä≥‚Äìf‚Ä≥.\\" Schoenberg describes it as a \\"wandering chord [vagierender Akkord]... it can come from anywhere\\" . =Mayrberger's opinion= After summarizing the above analyses Nattiez asserts that the context of the Tristan chord is A minor, and that analyses which say the key is E or E are \\"wrong\\". He privileges analyses of the chord as on the second degree (II). He then supplies a Wagner-approved analysis, that of Czech professor Carl , who \\"places the chord on the second degree, and interprets the G as an appoggiatura. But above all, Mayrberger considers the attraction between the E and the real bass F to be paramount, and calls the Tristan chord a Zwitterakkord (an ambiguous, hybrid, or possibly bisexual or androgynous, chord), whose F is controlled by the key of A minor, and D by the key of E major\\" (, ). Responses and influences The chord and the figure surrounding it is well enough known to have been parodied and quoted by a number of later musicians. Debussy includes the chord in a setting of the phrase 'je suis triste' in his opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande . Debussy also jokingly quotes the opening bars of Wagner's opera several times in \\"Golliwogg's Cakewalk\\" from his piano suite Children's Corner . Benjamin Britten slyly invokes it at the moment in Albert Herring when Sid and Nancy spike Albert's lemonade and then, when he drinks it, the chord \\"runs riot through the orchestra and recurs irreverently to accompany his hiccups\\" . Paul Lansky based the harmonic content of his first electronic piece, mild und leise (1973), on the Tristan chord . This piece is best known from being sampled in the Radiohead song \\"Idioteque\\". More recently, American composer and humorist Peter Schickele crafted a tango around this same figure, a chamber work for four bassoons entitled Last Tango in Bayreuth. The Brazilian conductor and composer Flavio Chamis wrote Tristan Blues, a composition based on the Tristan chord. The work, for harmonica and piano was recorded on the CD \\"Especiaria\\", released in Brazil by the Biscoito Fino label . In 1993, the opening theme was used in the film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould in the scene on Lake Simcoe as performed by the NBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Arturo Toscanini (recorded 1952). Gould had been a fan of Wagner and adapted some of his music to piano, some of Gould's rare recordings from the Romantic Period. The prelude of Wagner's opera is also prominently used in the film Melancholia by Lars von Trier .

It is commonly referred to as a \\"flintlock\\" (without the word mechanism), though that term is also commonly used for the weapons themselves as a whole, and not just the lock mechanism. The flintlock mechanism, also known as the true flintlock, was developed in France in the early 17th century. It quickly replaced earlier technologies, such as the matchlock and wheellock and the earlier flintlocks. It continued to be in common use for over two centuries, until it was finally replaced by the percussion lock.Flatnes, Oyvind. From Musket to Metallic Cartridge: A Practical History of Black Powder Firearms. Crowood Press, 2013, pp. 31‚Äì36. History Flintlock firing mechanisms made their appearance in the 16th century in the form of the snaplock, the snaphance, the miquelet, and the doglock. The so-called true flintlock was developed in France in the early 17th century. Though its exact origins are not known, credit for the development of the true flintlock is usually given to Marin le Bourgeoys, an artist, gunsmith, luthier, and inventor from Normandy, France. Marin le Bourgeoys's basic design became the standard for flintlocks, quickly replacing most older firing mechanisms throughout Europe. Flintlock weapons based on this design were used for over two centuries, until gradually superseded by caplock mechanisms in the early 19th century.\\"Pistols: An Illustrated History of Their Impact\\" By Jeff Kinard, Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004 The key element apparently added by Marin le Bourgeoys was the vertically acting sear. The sear is a \\"catch\\" or \\"latch\\" which holds the mechanism in a position ready to fire; the trigger acts upon, or is part of, the sear, releasing it and allowing a strong spring to act on the mechanism to fire the gun. Previously the sear, located within the lock, had acted through a hole in the lockplate to engage the cock on the outside of the plate. The vertically acting sear acted on a piece called the tumbler, on the inside of the lock which was mounted on the same rotating shaft as the cock. This design proved to be the most efficient in terms of cost and reliability. Construction and operation A typical flintlock mechanism has a piece of flint which is held in place in between a set of jaws on the end of a short hammer. This hammer (sometimes called the cock) is pulled back into the \\"cocked\\" position. When released by the trigger, the spring-loaded hammer moves forward, causing the flint to strike a piece of steel called the \\"frizzen\\". At the same time, the motion of the flint and hammer pushes the frizzen back, opening the cover to the pan, which contains the gunpowder. As the flint strikes the frizzen it creates a spark which falls into the pan and ignites the powder. Flame burns through a small hole into the barrel of the gun and ignites the main powder charge, causing the weapon to fire. Most hammers follow Marin le Bourgeoys's design, and have a \\"half-cocked\\" position, which is the \\"safe\\" position since pulling the trigger from this position does not cause the gun to fire. From this position, the frizzen can be opened, and powder can be placed in the pan. Then the frizzen is closed, and the hammer is pulled back into the \\"full cocked\\" position, from which it is fired. The phrase \\"don't go off half cocked\\" originated with these types of weapons, which were not supposed to fire from the half cocked position of the hammer. Flints An 1879 illustration showing Brandon gun flint knappers at work Making a gun flint by hand, by knapping, 2014 A gun flint is a piece of flint that has been shaped, or knapped into a wedge-shape that fits in the jaws of a flintlock. The gun flints were wrapped in a small piece of lead or leather (known as a flint pad) to hold them firmly in place and were made in different sizes to suit different weapons. Pieces of the mineral agate could be used instead of flint, but this was difficult and expensive to shape and only used by countries such as Prussia that were without access to flint deposits. The experience of modern flintlock shooters shows that a good quality flint can be used for hundreds of shots, although for reliable shooting it must be sharpened periodically. Despite this, it was the British practice to include a new flint in each box of twenty rounds for the Brown Bess musket. A skilled craftsman could make several thousand gun flints a day so they were individually quite cheap items. In times of war, millions of gun flints were needed and in the United Kingdom, mining flint and then knapping it became a substantial cottage industry around Brandon, Suffolk, an area that previously saw large scale flint mining in the Neolithic area. In 1804, Brandon was supplying over 400,000 flints a month to the British military. However flint knappers suffered from silicosis, known as Knappers Rot due to the inhalation of flint dust. It has been claimed this was responsible for the early death of three- quarters of Brandon gun flint makers. Brandon gun flints were well regarded as they had a lower rate of misfire than flints from other sources. The industry reached its height during and after the Napoleonic Wars, when Brandon flints were exported worldwide with a near global monopoly. However it declined rapidly as flintlocks were replaced by percussion locks. Although it still supplied 11 million flints a year to the Turkish army during the Crimean War and was exporting flints to Africa as late as the 1960s. In France, gun flint production between the 17th and 19th centuries centered around the small towns of Meusnes and Couffy. Meusnes has a small museum dedicated to the industry. A slightly different method of manufacture can allow archaeologists to distinguish between British-made and French made flints. In North America, imported French and British flints were both widely used, as well as flints from the Netherlands and Nordic countries. In the Eastern United States, Indigenous American people reportedly made their own gun flints by re-working stone spear heads. Small scale suppliers of gun flints still exist in the 21st century, supplying gun enthusiasts who continue to shoot flintlock firearms. Gunlocks An 1820s gunlock A gunlock was a flintlock mechanism that fired a cannon. They were a significant innovation in naval gunnery and were first used by the Royal Navy in 1745. Their use spread slowly as they could not be retrofitted to older guns ‚Äì the French had still not generally adopted them by the time of the Battle of Trafalgar (1805). The earlier method of firing a cannon was to apply a linstock ‚Äì a wooden staff holding a length of smoldering match at the end ‚Äì to the touch hole of the gun, which was filled with loose priming powder. This was dangerous and made accurate shooting from a moving ship impossible as the gun had to be fired while standing to the side to avoid its recoil, and there was a noticeable delay between the application of the linstock and the gun firing. The gunlock was operated by pulling a cord, known as a lanyard. The gun-captain could stand behind the gun, safely beyond its range of recoil, and sight along the gun, firing when the roll of the ship lined the gun up with the enemy and so avoid the chance of the shot hitting the sea or flying high over the enemy's deck. Loading the gun was faster and safer as the gunlock didn't use loose priming powder; the main charge was ignited by a quill filled with priming powder that was pushed through the touch hole during loading and pierced the cartridge bag, containing the main charge of gunpowder. After the introduction of gunlocks, linstocks were retained, but only as a backup means of firing. Other uses A clock, fitted with a flintlock to light a candle, c.1550. Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg Some early land mines, or fougasses, were detonated by flintlocks. Flintlocks were also used to launch Congreve rockets.British Rockets A flintlock tinder lighter, or tinder pistol, was a device that saw use in wealthy households from the 18th Century until the invention of reliable matches. It somewhat resembled a small flintlock pistol, but without a barrel and with a candle holder and with legs so it could be stood upright. When the trigger was pulled, the sparks from the frizzen lit dry tinder in the pan, from which the candle would be quickly lit. The device provided a quick and reliable source of light, and flame for the lighting of fires. Alarm clocks exist that, as well as sounding a bell, used a flintlock mechanism to light a candle. German and Austrian-made examples of these, dating from the 18th century, are preserved in the collections of the British Museum and the Hermitage Museum in Russia. An example dating from 1550 is in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum (German National Museum) in Nuremberg.

It has spread throughout Albanian- inhabited territories, and is today part of the traditional costume of the Albanians. The height of the cap varies region to region. Etymology Portrait of a young Albanian soldier wearing a plis. Oil on canvas by Charles Bargue (1826‚Äì1883). In Albanian: qeleshja or plisi, qeleshe or plisa, qeleshet or plisat. The style of cap is thought to originate from a similar cap worn by the Illyrians. The word qeleshe comes from the Albanian word for wool (lesh). According to Vladimir Orel, the word plis comes from Proto-Albanian *p(i)litja, related to Old High German filiz id., Latin pellis id. and Greek œÄ·øñŒªŒøœÇ pilos id., Proto-Slavic *p—ålst—å id.; according to Michael Driesen, Orel's reconstruction is incorrect. Process There are many ways to make the plis, the most common way in Kosovo is using soap on the Wool. The plis is always hand made. In the bazaar or Kruj√´, it is constructed by first getting a small chunk of wool is placed on the table. Then, an instrument similar to a bow is used to beat the wool by hammering the string with a stone or a piece of sturdy piece of wood. The wool is beaten and pressed until the wool strands finish knotting around eachother. Finally, it is washed, and shrinks. It is then pressed by a flat wooden-instrument on top of it multiple times until the wool becomes completily flat and smooth. Then, it is sealed in a flattener for 24 hours and added hot water and salt. The hat is made by two finished, flattened and pressed wool. the corners are removed in order to form a round shape. Afterwards, soap is added as a glue substitution to finely keep the strains smooth while both pieces of wool are massaged together. it is then washed and beaten to strengthen the walls, and be placed on a wooden-model. the shape of the plis will be decided on the wooden-model it is left to dry on, and then rubbed with soap again to glue the shape. The wool will be smoothened with a razer. Lastly, a wooden instrument will be firmly rubbed on the plis.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqb74msgv5Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhiAZuZtXgE Gloyer, Gillian (2012). Bradt Albania (engelsk). Bradt Travel Guides. s. 49. . History The origin of the Albanian plis and qeleshe descend from the ancient Illyrian cultureStipƒçeviƒá, Aleksandar (1977). The Illyrians. History and Culture (engelsk). Noyes Press. s. 89. .Recherches albanologiques. Folklore et ethnologie (albansk). Instituti Albanologijik i Prishtin√´s. 1982. s. 52.. Similar hats appear with similar silhuettes as the Illyrian version. An early depiction of the Plis can be seen on Johann Theodor de Bry depiction of Moisi Golemi from 1596, however, earlier Italian and documents exist depicting Albanians wearing the plis from earlier centuries.‚Üë Nopcsa 1925: Franz Baron Nopcsa: Albanien: Bauten, Trachten und Ger√§te Nordalbaniens. Berlin; Leipzig: Walter de Gruyter. 1925.. It is also argueded by Nopcsa that it may have been coloured red. During the 17-19 centuries, the apprearences description and appearences steadily multiplied, depicting it as a common Albanian headdress as it became more widespread and easily accessible to wear. The white version became the most popular one and was finally declared a spesific Albanian national costume during the Albanian Renaissance. in the 18-19 century, the plis became popularly depicted in painting depicting Arnaut, paintors like Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, Charles Bargue and Marie-Gabriel- Florent-Auguste de Choiseul-Gouffier would paint Albanian subjects of the Osman Empire with the plis, as a diverse presentation of the orient. It would be casually depicted in a formal setting, such as in The Albanian Marriage by Jean Pierre Louis Laurent Ho√ºel in 1785, where the priest is depicted with a plis. during the 19-20 century, Albanologists started taking photographs of Albanian national attires, many of which would include the Plis. Franz Nopcsa von Fels≈ë-Szilv√°s is photographed multiple times wearing the headdress. it then became a popular headdress for Albanian soldiers to wear during the battle for independence, Shota Galica, Isa Boletini and Azem Galica are depicted wearing the plis while fighting Italian, Turkish, Greek, Serbian and Montenegrin invaders during the Partition of Albania. Overview The cap is part of the traditional costume of the Albanian highlanders and is considered as a national symbol among a large number of Albanian communities.Gjergji, 2004, p. 166: \\"To this day many zones of the Dukagjin Plateau in Kosova and various zones inhabited by Albanians in Montenegro and Macedonia have preserved their folk costumes or some expressive element of the costume, such as the white \\"qeleshe\\" (brimless felt cap) considered as a symbol of their nationality.\\" During the Ottoman period, the hat as a white colored fez cap was the characteristic Albanian national headgear, in particular of Muslim Albanians. \\"Gli Albanesi, in parte di religione musulmana, conservano del lunghissimo periodo della dominazione turca il caratteristico fez bianco {qylaf o qeleshe), autentico copricapo nazionale, la cui altezza varia da regione a regione.\\" Wool products at the Kruja Ethnographic Museum. In the northern Albanian highlands, the shape is hemispherical, while in Kuk√´s, it is truncated. In southern Albania, the cap is taller than in northern Albania, especially in the Gjirokast√´r and Vlor√´ regions, with the exception of the Myzeqe low plains region. In some areas of southern Albania the cap has a small protrusion. The cap is made from one single piece of woolen felt, usually white, that is molded to the shape of the head. The town of Kruja is particularly known for Albania's traditional felt-makers who also produce the felt caps qeleshe. The cap is used by men during the traditional weddings of the Tirana region.

Sigrid appears in many sagas composed generations after the events they describe, but there is no reliable evidence as to her existence as they describe her. The figure of Sigrid appears mainly in late Icelandic sagas, while more contemporary sources such as Thietmar of Merseburg and Adam of Bremen instead claim that Sweyn was married to a Polish princess, identified as ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa.Pawe≈Ç Jasienica, Ostatnia z rodu, Pruszy≈Ñski i S-ka, Warszawa 2009, s. 113. Snorri Sturluson gives conflicting information and in one place says that Sweyn was married to Sigrid and in another that he was married to a Gunhild of Wenden. It is unclear if the figure of Sigrid was a real person, if the saga account of her is an amalgamation of the lives and deeds of several women, or if she is a completely fictional character. The latter view is held by some modern scholars, who do not give credibility to Sigrid's legacy in old Nordic sources and thus consider it a myth.  Account given in the Heimskringla  Heimskringla describes Sigrid as the beautiful but vengeful daughter of Skogul-Tosti, a powerful Swedish nobleman. As widow of Eric the Victorious, she held many great estates, and was living with her son Olav the Swede, when her foster-brother Harald Grenske, a king in Vestfold, sought her hand. She had him and another royal wooer, Vissavald of Gardarik, burned to death in a great hall following a feast to discourage other suitors. This episode earned her her byname. Her hand was next sought by Olaf Tryggvasson, the king of Norway, but he would have required that she convert to Christianity. She told him to his face, \\"I will not part from the faith which my forefathers have kept before me\\". In a rage, Olaf struck her with a glove, and Sigrid calmly told him, \\"This may some day be thy death\\". Sigrid then proceeded to create a coalition of his enemies to bring about his downfall. She allied Sweden with Denmark, marrying the widower Sweyn Forkbeard who had already been feuding with Olaf. Sweyn had sent his sister Tyri to marry the Wendish king Burislav, who had been the father of Sweyn's first wife, Gunhild. Tyri fled and married Olaf, goading him into conflict with her brother, while Sigrid inflamed Sweyn against her former suitor. This shared animosity would lead to the Battle of Swold, in which Olaf fell. Snorri also claims that Estrid Svendsdatter was a paternal sister of Cnut the Great, and as a daughter of Sigrid was maternal sister to Olav the Swede, but in another place says that Estrid was a daughter of Gunhild of Wenden. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus would repeat this information, writing that Eric the Victorious' widow Syritha had married Sweyn Forkbeard after having spurned Olaf Trygvasson. One further point that has been cited in favor of Sigrid's historical existence is that the holdings of the Danish kings in medieval Sweden were known as \\"Syghridslef\\" - 'the legacy of Sigrid'.  Contemporary chroniclers  There is scant material in medieval chronicles to provide details regarding the marriages of Sweyn of Denmark and Erik of Sweden: * Thietmar of Merseburg mentions that the daughter of Mieszko I of Poland and sister of Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry of Poland married Sweyn Forkbeard and gave him two sons, Cnut the Great and Harald II of Denmark, but he does not mention her name. Thietmar is probably the best informed of the medieval chroniclers addressing the question, since he was contemporary with the events described and well-informed about the events in Poland and Denmark. The assertion that Harald's and Canute's mother was Boleslaw's sister may explain some mysterious statements which appear in medieval chronicles, such as the involvement of Polish troops in invasions of England. * Adam of Bremen writes almost a century later that a Polish princess‚Äîthe sister or daughter of Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry of Poland‚Äîwas the wife of Eric the Victorious and by this marriage the mother of Olof Sk√∂tkonung of Sweden, before she became mother of Cnut the Great and Harald II of Denmark in her second marriage with Sweyn. Adam's claims about the marriage to Eric are considered unreliable by many historians, since he is the only source to state this relationship and because he is writing several generations later. The scholia of Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum mentions that it was the Polish king Boleslaw who gave the princess' hand in marriage. One problem is that Olof was born at latest in the early 980s, before Boleslaw Chrobry came to power, and therefore was too old to be the unnamed princess's son. During this time, marriages between Nordic monarchs and Vendic nobles was reoccurring for political reasons. For instance, Tove of the Obotrites, daughter of the Vendic lord Mistivoj, married King Harald Bluetooth of Denmark in the 960s. * Gesta Cnutonis regis mentions in one short passage that Canute and his brother went to the land of the Slavs, and brought back their mother, who was living there. This does not necessarily mean that his mother was Slavic, but nevertheless this chronicle strongly suggests that she was.  Modern reconstructions  These data have been used for alternative reconstructions. One would interpret the saga account of Sigrid as a confused rendering of a princess, ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa, daughter of first duke of the Polans Mieszko I, who married in succession Erik and Sweyn, being mother of Olaf (by Erik), Harald and Cnut (both by Sweyn). Sigrid would be either a contemporary name adopted by the Princess to conform to her new linguistic context, or else simply a name invented by saga writers who did not know or could not comprehend her Slavic name. This solution may further make her identical to Sweyn's first queen in the saga, 'Gunhild', daughter of Burislav, suggested to be a confused rendering of the same historical marriage to the sister of Boleslav of Poland. Alternatively, the attributed Polish marriages of Sweyn and Eric may have been to different women, with Gunhild being the daughter of Mieszko, while Eric's widow, a distinct princess and the model for Sigrid, married Sweyn after her. Finally, some consider Sigrid to be a fantasy created by Scandinavian saga writers.  Archaeology  Further confusion has been introduced by dated interpretations of an archaeological discovery. In 1835, the Haraldsk√¶r Woman was discovered in a peat bog in Jutland. This body of a woman was dated to the 11th century, and it was identified with Sigrid (or Gunhild). Radiocarbon dating later proved this dating incorrect, that the remains are much older. However, the erroneous dating became intertwined with numerous episodes of Scandinavian intrigue, as the theory was elaborated to serve a variety of agendas of kings and nobles prior to its redating.  In literature  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow composed a poem with the title \\"Queen Sigrid the Haughty\\" of which this is the first verse: : Queen Sigrid the Haughty sat proud and aloft : In her chamber, that looked over meadow and croft. : Heart's dearest, : Why dost thou sorrow so? Karen Blixen, in the short story \\"The Deluge at Norderney\\" in Seven Gothic Tales, refers to Sigrid, claiming that she invited all her suitors to her house and burned them in order to discourage other suitors. The story of Sigrid's life, loosely based on the Saga materials, is the focus of two novels by the Swedish writer and journalist, Johanne HildebrandtJohanne Hildebrandt: \\"Sigrid\\" (2014) and its sequel \\"Estrid\\" (2016). There are three novels about the life and times of Sigrid the Haughty (treating her as identical to ≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa): *El≈ºbieta Cherezi≈Ñska \\"Harda\\" (2016) (\\"The Haughty\\") and \\"Kr√≥lowa\\" (2016) (\\"The Queen\\"), *Maria Rawska-Mro≈ºkiewicz \\"≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa: C√≥rka Mieszka I, ≈ºona, matka skandynawskich Konung√≥w\\" (1987) (\\"≈öwiƒôtos≈Çawa: Daughter of Mieszko I, Wife, Mother of Scandinavian Kings\\") Bibliography * Oswald Balzer, Genealogia Piast√≥w, Krak√≥w 1895. * W≈Çodzimierz Dworzaczek, Genealogia, Warsaw 1959 * Andrzej Feliks Grabski, Boles≈Çaw Chrobry.

Fallowing is also essential to biodiversity, which ensures the presence of predators which can control pests. It is a technique often used in crop rotation. Existing weeds may be affected by predators and pests.

It is situated at a latitude of 7.77¬∞S and longitude of 35.69¬∞E. The name is derived from the Hehe word lilinga, meaning fort. Iringa is the administrative capital of Iringa Region. Iringa Municipal Council is the administrative designation of the Municipality of Iringa. Iringa has been one of the coldest regions in Tanzania due to its geographical location but that has attracted a lot of tourists from colder regions abroad especially Western Europe. Iringa also hosts one of Africa‚Äôs largest national parks the Ruaha National Park. Geography The town stretches along a hilltop overlooking the Little Ruaha River to the south, and spreads along ridges and valleys to the north. Iringa is in the Udzungwa Mountains, and the altitude of the town's environs is more than above sea level. The months of June, July, and August can see low temperatures near freezing. The Tanzam Highway passes through the valley below the town; the highway distance from Iringa's limits to Dar es Salaam is , via Morogoro. =Climate= History The Isimila Stone Age site, which lies about to the southwest, contains archeological artifacts, particularly stone tools, from human habitation about 70,000 years ago. Iringa Region is home to the Hehe people. After their stunning defeat at Lugalo by the Hehe, led by Chief Mkwawa, the Germans built a military station at 'Neu Iringa' to avenge the death of their commander Emil Von Zelewski and to teach the Hehe respect for German authority. The fortress and headquarters of Chief Mkwawa was in the nearby village of Kalenga, Alt Iringa. Education Iringa has several institutions of higher education, including Tumaini University, Iringa University College, Mkwawa University College of Education (a constituent college of the University of Dar es Salaam), and Ruaha Catholic University (RUCU)). Old and famous secondary Schools like Tosamaganga High School, Malangali high school, Iringa girls secondary school, Ifunda technical school and Ruaha Secondary School. Economy Iringa has a well-established industrial base, including food processing and logistics industries. Most of its electricity comes from the nearby Mtera Dam. Iringa is a minor transport hub for regular bus travelers. It is a center for trucking services to Dar es Salaam, Mbeya, Songea, and Dodoma and other regions of Tanzania. It is also a servicing town for trucks going to neighboring countries such as Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi, Burundi and other EAC countries. Crafts Iringa is famous for its woven baskets, made from local reeds. The baskets are used across Tanzania and exported internationally. The city is also known for the award-winning Neema Crafts Centre. Media Iringa Commonwealth War Cemetery Iringa municipality has seven FM radio stations: Trap Gang Radio, Ebony FM, Country FM and Nuru FM (youth entertainment and commercial radios), Overcomers Radio and Radio Furaha (Christian stations), Kibra Ten Radio (a Muslim station). There are other radio stations elsewhere in Iringa region, such as Kitulo community radio in Makete and another FM radio station in Njombe.

The synodic day is distinguished from the sidereal day, which is one complete rotation in relation to distant stars. This is different from the duration of a synodic day because the revolution of the body around its parent star would cause a single \\"day\\" to pass relative to a star, even if the body did not rotate itself. Earth's Synodic Day Earth's synodic day is the time it takes for _the Sun_ to pass over the same meridian (a line of longitude) on consecutive days, whereas a sidereal day is the time it takes for _a given star of reference_ to the pass over a meridian on consecutive days. So, for example in the Northern Hemisphere, a synodic day could be measured as the time taken for the sun move from exactly true south (i.e. its highest declination) on one day to exactly south again on the next day (or exactly true north in the Southern Hemisphere). For Earth, the synodic day is known as a solar day, and its mean length is 24 hours (with fluctuations on the order of milliseconds). This length is not constant, and changes over the course of the year due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the axial tilt of the Earth. This change accounts for the difference between the mean and apparent solar time in the equation of time, which can also be seen in Earth's analemma. The longest and shortest synodic days' durations differ by about 51 secondsJean Meeus (1997), Mathematical astronomy morsels (Richmond, VA: Willmann-Bell) 346. ..

Each synodic day, this gradual motion is a little less than 1¬∞ eastward (360¬∞ per 365.25 days), in a manner known as prograde motion. Certain spacecraft orbits, Sun-synchronous orbits, have orbital periods that are a fraction of a synodic day. Combined with a nodal precession, this allows them to always pass over a location on Earth's surface at the same mean solar time.

It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss. It can also be stated in terms of discriminants. There are related questions for real quadratic fields and for the behavior as d \\\\to -\\\\infty. The difficulty is in effective computation of bounds: for a given discriminant, it is easy to compute the class number, and there are several ineffective lower bounds on class number (meaning that they involve a constant that is not computed), but effective bounds (and explicit proofs of completeness of lists) are harder. Gauss's original conjectures The problems are posed in Gauss's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of 1801 (Section V, Articles 303 and 304).The Gauss Class-Number Problems, by H. M. Stark Gauss discusses imaginary quadratic fields in Article 303, stating the first two conjectures, and discusses real quadratic fields in Article 304, stating the third conjecture. ;Gauss Conjecture (Class number tends to infinity): h(d) \\\\to \\\\infty\\\\text{ as }d\\\\to -\\\\infty. ;Gauss Class Number Problem (Low class number lists): For given low class number (such as 1, 2, and 3), Gauss gives lists of imaginary quadratic fields with the given class number and believes them to be complete. ;Infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number one: Gauss conjectures that there are infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number one. The original Gauss class number problem for imaginary quadratic fields is significantly different and easier than the modern statement: he restricted to even discriminants, and allowed non-fundamental discriminants. Status ;Gauss Conjecture: Solved, Heilbronn, 1934. ;Low class number lists: Class number 1: solved, Baker (1966), Stark (1967), Heegner (1952). :Class number 2: solved, Baker (1971), Stark (1971) :Class number 3: solved, Oesterl√© (1985) :Class numbers h up to 100: solved, Watkins 2004 ;Infinitely many real quadratic fields with class number one: Open. Lists of discriminants of class number 1 For imaginary quadratic number fields, the (fundamental) discriminants of class number 1 are: :d=-3,-4,-7,-8,-11,-19,-43,-67,-163. The non-fundamental discriminants of class number 1 are: :d=-12,-16,-27,-28. Thus, the even discriminants of class number 1, fundamental and non-fundamental (Gauss's original question) are: :d=-4,-8,-12,-16,-28. Modern developments In 1934, Hans Heilbronn proved the Gauss Conjecture. Equivalently, for any given class number, there are only finitely many imaginary quadratic number fields with that class number. Also in 1934, Heilbronn and Edward Linfoot showed that there were at most 10 imaginary quadratic number fields with class number 1 (the 9 known ones, and at most one further). The result was ineffective (see effective results in number theory): it did not give bounds on the size of the remaining field. In later developments, the case n = 1 was first discussed by Kurt Heegner, using modular forms and modular equations to show that no further such field could exist. This work was not initially accepted; only with later work of Harold Stark and Bryan Birch (e.g. on the Stark‚ÄìHeegner theorem and Heegner number) was the position clarified and Heegner's work understood. Practically simultaneously, Alan Baker proved what we now know as Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms of algebraic numbers, which resolved the problem by a completely different method. The case n = 2 was tackled shortly afterwards, at least in principle, as an application of Baker's work. The complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with class number one is \\\\mathbf{Q}(\\\\sqrt{k}) with k one of :-1, -2, -3, -7, -11, -19, -43, -67, -163. The general case awaited the discovery of Dorian Goldfeld in 1976 that the class number problem could be connected to the L-functions of elliptic curves. This effectively reduced the question of effective determination to one about establishing the existence of a multiple zero of such an L-function. With the proof of the Gross-Zagier theorem in 1986, a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number could be specified by a finite calculation. All cases up to n = 100 were computed by Watkins in 2004. Real quadratic fields The contrasting case of real quadratic fields is very different, and much less is known. That is because what enters the analytic formula for the class number is not h, the class number, on its own ‚Äî but h log Œµ, where Œµ is a fundamental unit. This extra factor is hard to control. It may well be the case that class number 1 for real quadratic fields occurs infinitely often. The Cohen‚ÄìLenstra heuristicsCohen, ch. 5.10 are a set of more precise conjectures about the structure of class groups of quadratic fields. For real fields they predict that about 75.446% of the fields obtained by adjoining the square root of a prime will have class number 1, a result that agrees with computations.te Riele & Williams See also * List of number fields with class number one Notes References  * External links * Algebraic number theory Mathematical problems Unsolved problems in mathematics ","title":"Class number problem"},{"id":"596287","text":"A set of bolita balls on display at the Ybor City State Park Museum, Ybor City Bolita (Spanish for Little Ball) is a type of lottery which was popular in the latter 19th and early 20th centuries in Cuba and among Florida's working class Hispanic, Italian, and black population. In the basic bolita game, 100 small numbered balls are placed into a bag and mixed thoroughly, and bets are taken on which number will be drawn. Many variations on this theme were created. Bets were typically very small and sometimes sold well in advance, and the game could be rigged, by having extra balls of a given number or not including others at all. Other means of cheating included having certain balls filled with lead so they would sink to the bottom of the bag, or putting certain balls in ice beforehand so they would be cold and therefore easy for the selector to find by touch. Over time, Hispanics developed a name for each number in a system called La Charada or Las Charadas, creating a superstitious method for interpreting game outcomes or placing bets, many times in accordance with one's dreams the previous night. Today Bolita is played in the United States, among Cuban, Dominican and Puerto Rican groups. History Bolita was brought to Tampa, Florida, in the 1880s, and flourished in Ybor City's many Latin saloons. Though the game was illegal in Florida, thousands of dollars in bribes to politicians and law enforcement officials kept the game running out in the open. The alleged king of bolita in the 1920s was Tampa native, Charlie Wall. During the late 1920s, a turf war began between Wall and Italian gangster Ignacio Antinori, who fought each other, as for control of the numbers rackets in the Tampa area. By the 1930s, Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as \\"Era of Blood\\". Wall's closest associate, Evaristo \\"Tito\\" Rubio was shot on his porch on March 8, 1938. Eddie Virella, \\"Tito's\\" former partner at the Lincoln Club, was shot down by gunmen little more than a year before, on 31 January 1937. The war ended in the 1940s with Ignacio Antinori being shot and killed with a sawed-off shotgun.Charlie Wall Later, Italian mafiosi Santo Trafficante, Sr. and Santo Trafficante, Jr. also figured prominently in the Florida bolita games.

Background Lee was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. The second daughter of a father from Hong Kong and a mother from Mainland China, Lee was raised as a devout Roman Catholic. Her father was a post-World War II orphan from Hong Kong, and her mother an escapee from Communist China who remained in and out of psychiatric institutions when Lee was young. She grew up within a strict, secretive and unstable family. When Lee was 15, her parents split up and Lee ran away from home, for a time living on the streetSook-Yin Lee, comment on Definitely Not the Opera, CBC radio, 2 November 2010 before eventually living with a \\"community of lesbians and artists\\". In the mid-1980s, she became the lead singer for Bob's Your Uncle, a Vancouver alternative rock band. Lee often incorporated performance art techniques into the band's melodic rock. When that band broke up, Lee pursued a solo music career, releasing several solo albums and performing as an actor in theatre, film and television projects. She was the lead singer for the band Slan. Neko Case covered Lee's song \\"Knock Loud\\" on her 2001 EP Canadian Amp. She was in a relationship with writer and musician Adam Litovitz, who was also her frequent artistic collaborator, from 2007 until 2018.\\"Sook-Yin Lee: Candid with the Camera ‚Äî Except for One Thing\\".

Daily Xtra, May 8, 2015. Broadcasting Lee became a VJ for MuchMusic in 1995, hosting MuchMusic's alternative music show The Wedge. In 1995, on the day that sexual orientation was held to be protected under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Egan v Canada case, Lee celebrated the decision by kissing a woman on the air. She later appeared on the cover of Xtra! in 1997. During her last appearance as a MuchMusic VJ in 2001, Lee and her co-host turned their backs to the camera, and mooned the audience on live television. She became the new host of CBC Radio One's Saturday afternoon pop culture magazine radio-show Definitely Not the Opera in 2002. Definitely Not the Opera completed its run in 2016. In the fall of 2004, she hosted a documentary celebrating Terry Fox as part of the CBC Television series The Greatest Canadian. In 2016, Lee hosted the 10 episode summer series Sleepover for CBC Radio, which continued as a podcast until 2018. In 2020, Lee hosted the Canadian adaptation of Landscape Artist of the Year for Makeful.Greg David, \\"Makeful TV launches Landscape Artist of the Year Canada, a new competition series hosted by Sook-Yin Lee\\". TV, eh?, January 16, 2020. Film work As a feminist, Lee specifically works on films that discusses feminist and/or racial issues. Escapades of One Particular Mr. Noodle (1990) was her debut as a feminist film director. This film was produced by Studio D, a primarily feminist film production company, as one of the short films in their segment Five Feminist Minutes (1990). Lee played the lead character Alessa Woo, alongside fellow Canadian actor Adam Beach, in Helen Lee's 2001 film The Art of Woo. In the Canadian Romantic Comedy The Art of Woo (2001) Sook-Yin Lee plays Alessa Woo who is a Chinese painter seeking rich men to provide for her while simultaneously developing a sexual relationship with an Aboriginal painter who lives in her building. This film explores issues of poverty and interracial couples. Lee also has a smaller part in John Cameron Mitchell's film Hedwig and the Angry Inch, playing Kwahng-Yi, a guitarist in Hedwig's rock band made up of Korean-born army wives. Hedwig and the Angry Inch explores issues of sexuality and gender identity. In this film Hedwig, formerly known as Hansel, is forced into body- altering surgery to change her physical sex from male to female in order to legally marry a man. Hedwig, a punk rock singer, explores her gender identity in the island of freedom represented by her music scene against the background of the complex sociopolitical environment presented near the fall of the Berlin Wall. The characters suffer discrimination against same sex couples and trans people. In 2003, she became the centre of controversy when Mitchell first announced that he was casting Lee in his film Shortbus (released 2006). Due to Mitchell's announcement that the film was to be sexually explicit in nature ‚Äì Lee and other cast members perform non-simulated intercourse and masturbation on screen ‚Äì the CBC initially threatened to fire her. In making Shortbus Mitchell sought to make a film about love and sex without censoring itself. Celebrities such as director Francis Ford Coppola, R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, actress Julianne Moore and artist and musician Yoko Ono, as well as the CBC's listening audience, rallied behind her, and the CBC ultimately relented. The movie premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Her performance in Shortbus earned Lee the 2007 International Cinephile Society Award for Best Supporting Actress. This was not her first film that explores a sexually explicit nature. She acted in 3 Needles (2005), a short film about HIV and Aids. The film takes place in various locations around the world - Canada, China, and South Africa - demonstrating the universality of STDs/STIs. In 2012 she was chosen to play Olivia Chow in the biopic television film Jack, alongside Rick Roberts as Jack Layton. The film aired on CBC Television in 2013. She subsequently won the 2014 Canadian Screen Award for Best Performance by a Lead Dramatic Actress in a Program/Mini-Series. Lee stars in, wrote and directed The Brazilian segment of the 2008 film Toronto Stories. Her feature film directorial debut Year of the Carnivore premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009. Lee, Litovitz and Buck 65 also collaborated on the film's soundtrack, which garnered a Genie Award nomination for Best Original Score at the 31st Genie Awards. Her second feature film as a director, Octavio Is Dead!, premiered at the Inside Out Film and Video Festival in 2018, and received several Canadian Screen Award nominations at the 7th Canadian Screen Awards. Theatrical work In 2013, Lee wrote and starred in a theatrical performance show How Can I Forget? at Toronto's Rhubarb and Summerworks theatre festivals. It went on to be performed in conjunction with her solo art show We Are Light Rays at the Ottawa Art Gallery. She and Litovitz also staged Morrice Fled: Two Paintings Talk to Each Other, a pop-up performance at the Art Gallery of Ontario based on the art of James Wilson Morrice, in January. In 2014, Lee choreographed a dance solo for Syreeta Hector as part of On Display for Toronto Dance Theatre. From 2015-2017, she created and directed Sphere of Banished Suffering with dancers Jenn Goodwin, Mairi Greig, and Charlie McGettigan with Litovitz developed in residencies with LUFF art+dialogue, Dancemakers, Artscape Sandbox, and premiered at the Festival of New Dance 2017.

It is a joint venture between three European aero-engine manufacturers, Germany's MTU Aero Engines, France's Turbomeca and Britain's Rolls-Royce. To date, the company's only product has been the MTR390, which was specifically developed for helicopter applications. It powers the Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter. History MTU Turbomeca Rolls-Royce (MTR) was established during June 1989 as a part of the framework created on behalf of the French and West German governments to developed an advanced multirole battlefield helicopter, the Eurocopter Tiger. While a joint venture between the French aerospace firm A√©rospatiale and German company Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm (MBB) was chosen as the principal contractors to develop the rotorcraft itself, a separate entity was established to develop the MTR390 powerplant to power it.Krotz 2001, pp. 130-131. Specifically, MTR was designated as the programme management company responsible for the engine, and was jointly staffed by the partner companies, Germany's MTU Aero Engines, France's Turbomeca and Britain's Rolls-Royce. Operationally, MTR manages the direction and coordination of all development, production and support activities associated with the MTR390 engine; it is also responsible for marketing and sales of the engine for other military and civil applications. The company is recognised as the responsible contractual party accountable to the government agencies of the customer nations. Work is divided into functional groups formed by members of each partner company. The engine is constructed from modules that are separately manufactured at the facilities of the MTR partner companies. The initial workshare was as follows: Turbomeca produced the compressor, gearbox, accessories and control system, Rolls-Royce manufactured the power turbine stage, while MTU was responsible for the combustor, high-pressure turbine, along with the final assembly of the entire first batch of engines. During 1997, the engine programme advanced to the production investment phase; that same year, it was granted civil registration, while military qualification would follow during 1999. On 18 June 1999, Germany and France publicly placed orders for an initial batch of 160 Tiger helicopters, 80 for each nation, valued at ‚Ç¨3.3 billion.Krotz 2011, pp. 132, 149. Accordingly, during early 2000, an initial production contract was signed by the German Federal Office of Defence Technology and Procurement (BWB) and MTR; valued at DM430 million and comprising 320 engines plus spares, the contract represented the MTU390's clearance for production. On 22 March 2002, the first production Tiger was rolled out in a large ceremony held at Eurocopter's Donauw√∂rth factory; although production models began initial acceptance trials in 2003, the first official delivery to the French Army took place on 18 March 2005; the first official Tiger delivery to Germany followed on 6 April 2005.Krotz 2011, p. 154. The MTU390 itself is a FADEC-controlled turboshaft engine; each Tiger helicopter is powered by a pair of these engines.\\"Tiger - Technology.\\" Eurocopter, Retrieved: 17 February 2013. At one point, it was projected that roughly 1,000 engines would be produced in-line with a production run of 427 Tigers.

The county town and cathedral city is Barchester. Other towns in the novels include Silverbridge, Hogglestock and Greshamsbury. Origins According to E. A. Freeman, Trollope conceded to him that Barset was in origin Somerset, although Barchester itself was primarily Winchester. Other West Country counties like Dorset also contributed, and Gatherum Castle for example was imported from elsewhere, but such important elements as Plumstead Episcopi were drawn directly from Somerset life, in this case Huish Episcopi. In sum, Barset was (in Trollope's own words) \\"a little bit of England which I have myself created\\". Political structure In Doctor Thorne Trollope describes how the county, formerly represented by a single parliamentary constituency, was split into two constituencies, the more rural East Barsetshire, which includes Barchester, and the more commercial West Barsetshire, by the Reform Act 1832.A. Trollope, Doctor Thorne (London, 1947) p. 2 The borough of Silverbridge, according to the Palliser novels, also elects a Member of Parliament. Interpretation Adam Gopnik wrote in The New Yorker, \\"The six Barsetshire novels... are as much a triumph of the sympathetic imagination as Tolkien's books: it is an entirely invented world, which Trollope entered by transposing his broader knowledge of how the world works onto the inner workings of a cathedral town. The beauty of the idea, though, was that it gave him a way to condense into comedy the crisis of his time: in an age of reform, what would happen to the most conservative and settled institution in England when reform arrived for it, too?\\" Later fictional usage The novel Barchester Pilgrimage (1935), and some of the episodes in Let Dons Delight (1939), both by Ronald Knox, refer to Barsetshire and its inhabitants. Barsetshire was also used as the setting for a series of 29 novels by Angela Thirkell, written from 1930 to 1961. Thirkell's stories blend social satire with romance. Her 1946 novel, Private Enterprise, explored discontent with the bureaucracy of the Attlee government ‚Äì something echoed by Orville Prescott in his poem-review beginning \\"In Barchester all is not well\\".J. Bew, Citizen Clemm (London 2016) p. 449-51 Thirkell's final Barsetshire book, Three Score and Ten, was completed posthumously, and published in 1961. Barsetshire is also used in some of the Pullein-Thompson sisters books, usually referring to rival teams or as a nearby county. Barchester and Barset were used as names for the fictional county in which St Trinians School was supposedly located in the original films. The county is also mentioned in Michael Innes's Appleby and Honeybath where it is suggested that \\"the shifting of county boundaries has pretty well done away with Barsetshire\\" (p 27). Kevin Kwan's novel Rich People Problems names Barsetshire and the village of Barchester as the family home of Lucien Montagu-Scott and his wife, Colette Bing. =Barchester= Barchester is used as a railway station and location for some of the 1942 Ealing Studios film The Black Sheep of Whitehall. Barchester Cathedral was used as the setting for the ghost story The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral by M. R. James in his 1911 collection More Ghost Stories. It is also the setting for Charlie Lovett's 2017 literary mystery The Lost Book of the Grail; or, A Visitor's Guide to Barchester Cathedral. William Golding refers to Barchester and its cathedral in passing in his 1967 novel The Pyramid, set in the small fictional market town of Stilbourne.

Taxonomy The Malabar pied hornbill was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Buceros coronatus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The Malabar pied hornbill is now placed in the genus Anthracoceros that was introduced by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach in 1849. The species is monotypic. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek anthrax, meaning \\"coal black\\" and ker≈çs, meaning \\"horn\\". The specific epithet coronatus is Latin for \\"crowned\\". Description The Malabar pied hornbill is a large hornbill, at in length. It has mainly black plumage, apart from its white belly, throat patch, tail sides and trailing edge to the wings. The bill is yellow with a large, mainly black casque. Females have white orbital skin, which the males lack. Juveniles have no casque. It might be confused with the oriental pied hornbill. Distribution and habitat Two hornbills in Yala National Park in Sri Lanka. The Malabar pied hornbill is a common resident breeder in India and Sri Lanka. Its habitat is evergreen and moist deciduous forests, often near human settlements. =Nature and behaviour=  Breeding  During incubation, the female lays two or three white eggs in a tree hole, which is blocked off with a cement made of mud, droppings and fruit pulp. There is only one narrow aperture, just big enough for the male to transfer food to the mother and chicks. When the chicks have grown too large for the mother to fit in the nest with them, she breaks out and rebuilds the wall, after which both parents feed the chicks. Malabar Pied Hornbills at Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary  Food and feeding  This species is omnivorous, taking fruits, small mammals, birds, small reptiles, insects etc. Prey is killed and swallowed whole. Figs are an important food, contributing 60% of their diet from May to February, the non-breeding season; during breeding, in March and April, up to 75% of the fruits delivered at the nest were figs. They also feed on other fruits, including those of the Strychnos nux-vomica, which are toxic to many vertebrates.Balasubramanian, P.; R. Saravanan and B. Maheswaran (2004). \\"Fruit preferences of Malabar Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros coronatus in Western Ghats, India\\".

He is best known for his Birds of South Africa, first published in 1940. He also studied the mammalian fauna of the region: his work The mammals of South Africa was published posthumously in 1951. The 7th edition of Roberts' Birds of Southern Africa which appeared in 2005, is the standard work on the region's birds. Biography Roberts, son of Alfred Roberts (church minister) and Marianne Fannin (naturalist and flower artist), was born in Pretoria and grew up in Potchefstroom, South Africa. He gained much of his early knowledge of zoology from Thomas Ayres (1828‚Äì1913), one of South Africa's first amateur ornithologists. Ayres taught Roberts to skin birds and small mammals as well as the importance of keeping accurate records on every specimen. He also encouraged Roberts to study birds systematically. Roberts worked as a clerk in the Potchefstroom branch of Standard Bank from 1901 to 1903 and thereafter in the Department of Inland Revenue in Potchefstroom, Pretoria and Wolmaransstad. In April 1906 he enlisted as a trooper in John Royston's irregular regiment during the Bambatha Rebellion in Natal. The unit demobilised in August 1906 and Roberts and his brother, Noel, collected birds eggs and nests which they then presented to the Transvaal Museum in Pretoria. Roberts then worked as a temporary clerk in the Department of Agriculture until December 1907 when he joined the Natal militia as a trooper. In 1908 he accompanied Frederick V. Kirby on an expedition to Quelimane district in Mozambique to destroy lions for the Boror Company on their coffee and sugar plantations. During this expedition Roberts collected 340 bird skins and several small mammals, which he sold to the Transvaal Museum. After a period of blackwater fever, Roberts was employed by the Transvaal Museum in 1910 as a temporary zoological assistant under J. W. B. Gunning. In 1913 he was given a permanent position and put in charge of the museum's bird and mammal collections. In 1914 he married Dora S. Cooper (n√©e Barrett), with whom he had three sons and a daughter. During World War I (1914-1918) he served in German East Africa and Palestine. He established a collection of over 30 000 birds and 13 000 mammals. These were collected on expeditions to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe, 1914), the Vernay-Lang Kalahari Expedition (1930), the Barlow Expedition to South West Africa (now Namibia). He remained at the Transvaal Museum for 38 years until 1946, but it seems that his lack of formal education retarded both his professional advancement and recognition. Over the span of his career he described and named 429 bird taxa and 406 mammal taxa. His approach to taxonomy was to create a new genus, species or subspecies based on slight difference, a method he defended vigorously. His new genera were not generally well received by the \\"systematists\\" and the majority of the new genera, species and subspecies were not accepted. However, owing to his vast field experience he came to be regarded as the greatest authority on South African birds and mammals. He was author of several manuscripts and articles in scientific publications, including over a hundred papers in the Annals of the Transvaal Museum, Journal of the South African Ornithologists' Union and The Ostrich. His book \\"The birds of South Africa\\", illustrated by Norman C.K. Lighton, was the first comprehensive work on the subject. It has been revised and expanded by various experts and several editions published. Early in 1948 he was offered the post of curator of the Queen Victoria Museum in Harare, but his death on 5 May 1948 in a motor car accident in the Transkei region prevented him from taking up the position. The flowering plants he collected are in the National Herbarium, Pretoria, while his fungi went to the National Collection of Fungi at the Plant Protection Research Institute in Pretoria. His compilation of a comprehensive book on mammals was more or less completed at the time of his death and subsequently edited by R. Bigalke, V.F. Fitzsimons and D.E. Malan and published as The mammals of South Africa, with illustrations by P.J. Smit. Roberts had also been planning a comprehensive bird book but at the time of his death had only completed the part dealing with sea birds. The work was eventually completed by P.A.R. Hocky, W.R.J. Dean and P.G. Ryan and published as Roberts birds of Southern Africa.

The show was first aired on BBC One on the children's block, Children's BBC (CBBC), In September 2020, all episodes of Brum were made available on BBC iPlayer.https://metro.co.uk/2020/09/24/bbc- mistakenly-slap-childrens-tv-programme-brum-with-warning-over-language-and- attitudes-of-the-90s-13319129/ Plot and setting Brum is the story of a small replica car who ventures out into Big Town when his owner isn't looking, and gets up to all manner of adventures. Each episode begins and ends in the same way, with Brum leaving the other cars in the motor museum when the owner's back is turned and heading out to explore Big Town, before eventually returning to his place. Each series has had its own background music. From series 1-2 the introduction music was the same but in series 2 they used different instruments. From Series 3-5 the music became jazzy and a new Title sequence was Directed by Nigel P. Harris. The car can express himself in various mechanical ways including opening and closing his doors and bonnet, bobbing his suspension, and flashing and swivelling. The actors in Brum do not speak ‚Äì mime and off-screen narration help propel the story. It was therefore easy to prepare episodes for airing in other countries, and the series has been broadcast in many parts of the world and in many languages. The stories are set in the city of Birmingham, England, since in addition to its onomatopoeic nature of a car engine revving, Brum (as a contraction of \\"Brummagem\\") is a common colloquial name for Birmingham. Although later series make no direct mention of Birmingham, calling it simply Big Town, many of the city's streets and landmarks can be seen in each episode. The show was written by a range of writers. Anne Wood primarily wrote all the first series, while the second was written by Tom Poole, Dirk Campbell, Andrew Davenport and Morgan Hall. The last two series were written by Nigel P. Harris (5 Episodes) and the existing Ragdoll team. The car itself ‚Äì a half-scale replica of a late-1920s Austin 7 Chummy convertible ‚Äì was designed and built by Rex Garrod. It is now housed at the Cotswold Motoring Museum in Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire, which is also where the opening and closing sequences of the programme were filmed.

In September 2020, as part of the 35th anniversary of CBBC, episodes of the first two seasons were added to BBC iPlayer in the UK. The BBC however, accidentally added a warning message warning viewers of over its use of ‚Äòlanguage and attitudes‚Äô of the 90s.This message was then removed in the afternoon of the day it was added. DHX Media revivals February 2016 saw the release of a rebooted Brum, made by the current owners of the franchise DHX Media. The show now takes place in a white world instead of Big Town and features new friends for Brum. The first episode, \\"Brum's Car Wash Adventure\\", premiered on 4 March 2016 via the official Brum YouTube channel. A total of 25 CGI episodes were produced, with a second series currently airing. Another series, this time animated using Toon Boom Harmony Animation called \\"Brum & Friends\\" premiered on the channel in September 2017.

B√ºttikofer was born in Ranfl√ºh (part of R√ºderswil, Canton of Bern) in the Emmental. He is best known for his two zoological expeditions to the Republic of Liberia (1879 to 1882 and 1886 to 1887) and resulting publications; from 1897 to 1924 he was the Director of the Blijdorp Zoological Garden in Rotterdam. After his retirement he settled in Bern, Switzerland. For his extensive contributions to the knowledge of Liberian fauna he is regarded as the 'Father of Liberian Natural History'. Scientific career Johann B√ºttikofer learned his love of nature from his father Jakob, who was a school teacher in his native Ranfl√ºh. He attended village school until the age of 16 and then studied French for one year, after which he attended a teacher training college in Hofwil until the age of 20. He taught school in Graswil, Switzerland for six years, hunted, began to learn taxidermy, read travel accounts, and longed to visit the tropics. He left teaching to become a preparator at the Natural History Museum of Bern where he attended lectures by Prof. Theophil Studer, who had just returned from travelling around the world. In 1878, Prof. Ludwig R√ºtimeyer of Basel recommended him to become an assistant to Dr. Hermann Schlegel, the director of the Royal Museum of Natural History (Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, now Naturalis Biodiversity Center) in Leiden, the Netherlands. He became an understudy of Schlegel, who sought to expand the museum's role in understanding animal life in Western Africa. B√ºttikofer joined Dr. Schlegel on a study trip to the major museums of Germany and Austria. Recognizing B√ºttikofer's capabilities and potential, Schlegel proposed sending him on a six-year expedition to Africa to collect zoological specimens from several largely unexplored forest regions, specifically Liberia, the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast, Cameroon and Gabon. Liberia was selected as the first destination, principally because the expedition had been offered free transportation on the ships of the Rotterdam trading firm Hendrik Muller & Co. which had several trading factories along the Liberian coast. Two zoological expeditions to Liberia were carried out between November 1879 - April 1882 and November 1886 - June 1887; the great success of the Liberia expeditions, the death of Dr. Schlegel, and Buttikofer's own health considerations caused the other initially planned destinations to be dropped. In 1890 he published a two-volume work, \\"Reisebilder aus Liberia\\" in German. This constituted the first monograph on the Republic of Liberia, and contains some of the earliest photographs of nature in Liberia. An annotated English translation of this publication was produced in November, 2012 by Brill (Leiden), titled \\"Travel Sketches from Liberia: Johann B√ºttikofer's 19th Century Rainforest Explorations in West Africa\\", co-edited by Henk Dop and Phillip T. Robinson. =First expedition= On the first expedition, B√ºttikofer was accompanied by a Dutchman, Mr. Carolus Franciscus Sala of Leiden, who had previously served in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and had also collected zoological specimens in present-day Angola. Venturing into areas in the lands of the Gola people along the Saint Paul River that had never before been visited by Europeans, B√ºttikofer and Sala were highly successful in their collecting activities. Among their finds was the first ever complete specimen of the zebra duiker (Cephalophus zebra). Suffering from a range of adversities, rapacious local chieftains, malaria and other tropical medical afflictions, B√ºttikofer and Sala next set up a collecting station at Robertsport. Here, Sala's condition worsened, and he died on 10 June 1881 and was buried in a mission cemetery. B√ºttikofer continued collecting, now in the company of the Liberian hunter Jackson Demery, and also visited the various coastal trading factories in eastern Liberia, until severe ill health forced him to return to Europe. During a lengthy period of convalescence, B√ºttikofer wrote an extensive account of his findings, in Dutch, which was published in 1883 in the journal of the Netherlands Royal Geographical Society, whose translated title is: \\"A Report on Liberia: Results of a Journey of Exploration Undertaken by J. B√ºttikofer and C. F. Sala in the Years 1879-1882.\\" When Prof. Schlegel died in 1884, B√ºttikofer was appointed Curator of Birds. =Second expedition= Whereas B√ºttikofer's first expedition was funded by Dr. Schlegel, his second was largely financed by himself, on an unpaid leave of absence, with costs to be recuperated by selling specimens to the Leiden museum and others. As a co- worker, he recruited a Swiss boyhood acquaintance and fellow avid hunter, Mr. Franz Xaver Stampfli (1847-1903) of Solothurn, Switzerland, who had come to visit him while intending to emigrate to the United States. Stampfli travelled to Liberia in 1884 while B√ºttikofer continued his recovery. During his stay in the general area of the Junk River, Stampfli discovered an antelope species entirely new to science, the Jentink's duiker (Cephalophus jentinki), but had to return for convalescence in the spring of 1886. In November 1886 B√ºttikofer and Stampfli jointly set out for Liberia. While B√ºttikofer conducted a journey to Robertsport to collect Jackson Demery to join the expedition, Stampfli set up a collecting station at Schieffelinsville. After extensive forays in the surrounding area, a second station was set up in Hill Town, which proved to be most successful. Here, the first ever complete specimens of the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis) were collected. In May 1887, at the expiry of his leave of absence and again suffering from ill-health, B√ºttikofer returned to Europe while Stampfli continued collecting for another year. Encouraged by the earlier success of the \\"Results of a Journey of Exploration\\", B√ºttikofer combined the results of the two expeditions into the two-volume German \\"Reisebilder aus Liberia\\" published by E. J. Brill (Leiden) in 1890. To this day, this work stands out as the first comprehensive monograph ever written about the Republic of Liberia, including natural history, geology, agricultural production, ethnography, customs and dress, history, finance, commerce and trade etc.; while also providing highly vivid travel accounts. Apart from the already mentioned finds, the collected material resulted in the identification of more entirely new species and subspecies of a variety of taxa, for example, Stampfli's spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans stampflii), the lesser spot-nosed monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans buettikoferi), B√ºttikofer's shrew (Crocidura buettikoferi), B√ºttikofer's epauletted fruit bat (Epomops buettikoferi), and B√ºttikofer's bichir (Polypterus palmas buettikoferi). B√ºttikofer's animal specimens are in a number of European museum collections, but principally at the natural history museum in Leiden (Naturalis). Ethnographic artifacts from his work in Liberia, as well as collection of photographs taken during the second expedition, are at the Rijksmuseum Volkenkunde in Leiden (Museum Volkenkunde), the World Museum (Wereldmuseum) in Rotterdam, and at the Historical Museum of Bern in Switzerland. The \\"Reisebilder aus Liberia\\", as well as the ongoing series of publications based upon his collected specimens, soon established B√ºttikofer as the unrivalled authority on Liberian fauna. Having maintained close contact with scientific circles in Switzerland, the University of Bern bestowed an honorary doctorate degree (dr. phil. h. c.) upon him in 1895. Around that same year, the Liberian Government awarded him the Liberian Humane Order of African Redemption, which recognizes individuals for assisting the Liberian nation and for playing prominent roles in the 'uplifting of its people'. Thereafter, when the subject of Liberia came before many scientific groups, the general reaction was reported to be, in essence, 'No need to go to Liberia, for Dr. B√ºttikofer has thoroughly covered that subject.' B√ºttikofer's very success may have impeded further zoological work in Liberia for several decades. =Third expedition= In 1893-1894 B√ºttikofer was the official zoologist of the Nieuwenhuis Expedition to central Borneo, organized by Anton Willem Nieuwenhuis, a well-known Dutch explorer. This work resulted in valuable contributions to the knowledge of the wildlife of that region, during which he travelled up the Mandai and Sibau rivers and also ascended Mt. Kenepai and Mt. Liang Koebeng. Several birds, reptiles, and invertebrates from there still bear his name today, including, for example, B√ºttikofer's babbler (Pellorneum buettikoferi), B√ºttikofer's glass lizard (Dopasia buettikoferi), and a skink (Sphenomorphus buettikoferi). At a later date, B√ºttikofer remarked that working in the East Indies was more like a \\"holiday journey\\" in contrast to the difficulties that he had faced in Liberia. Between 1897 and 1924, B√ºttikofer was the Director of the Zoological Garden in Rotterdam. During his long directorship he was associated with some of the main forerunners of nature conservation in The Netherlands. Nature conservation B√ºttikofer was chairman of the Dutch Society for the Protection of Birds (1909-1924). A small 6 ha ornithological reserve established in his honour in 1926 on the island of Texel in the North Holland province of the Netherlands still bears the name B√ºttikofer's Mieland. This reserve is now part of a complex of larger and smaller terrains referred to as \\"The low lands of Texel\\" and managed by the Netherlands Society for the Preservation of Natural Monuments Vereniging Natuurmonumenten. In 1924 B√ºttikofer retired and relocated to Bern, Switzerland, residing only a short distance from the natural history museum where he began his highly productive career. He remained active in scientific meetings until he died of pneumonia on June 24, 1927, following a trip to the Dutch East Indies. He was survived by his wife Petronella. Dr. B√ºttikofer was held in high regard by his European and African colleagues. Some 25 years after his death, Dr. G. A. Brouwer noted, in his book on Dutch ornithologists that \\"he was not merely a friend of animals, but he also had a great sympathy for his fellow man, a characteristic that had already been very useful in Liberia, and was pleasant, convivial and a man of authority, who played a leading role in several societies.\\" Sources Anon. 1927.

The Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider (LEP) was one of the largest particle accelerators ever constructed. It was built at CERN, a multi-national centre for research in nuclear and particle physics near Geneva, Switzerland. LEP collided electrons with positrons at energies that reached 209 GeV. It was a circular collider with a circumference of 27 kilometres built in a tunnel roughly 100 m (300 ft) underground and passing through Switzerland and France. LEP was used from 1989 until 2000. Around 2001 it was dismantled to make way for the Large Hadron Collider, which re-used the LEP tunnel. To date, LEP is the most powerful accelerator of leptons ever built. Collider background LEP was a circular lepton collider ‚Äì the most powerful such ever built. For context, modern colliders can be generally categorized based on their shape (circular or linear) and on what types of particles they accelerate and collide (leptons or hadrons). Leptons are point particles and are relatively light. Because they are point particles, their collisions are clean and amenable to precise measurements; however, because they are light, the collisions cannot reach the same energy that can be achieved with heavier particles. Hadrons are composite particles (composed of quarks) and are relatively heavy; protons, for example, have a mass 2000 times greater than electrons. Because of their higher mass, they can be accelerated to much higher energies, which is the key to directly observing new particles or interactions that are not predicted by currently accepted theories. However, hadron collisions are very messy (there are often many unrelated tracks, for example, and it is not straightforward to determine the energy of the collisions), and therefore more challenging to analyze and less amenable to precision measurements. A section of the LEP Particle beam tube The shape of the collider is also important. High energy physics colliders collect particles into bunches, and then collide the bunches together. However, only a very tiny fraction of particles in each bunch actually collide. In circular colliders, these bunches travel around a roughly circular shape in opposite directions and therefore can be collided over and over. This enables a high rate of collisions and facilitates collection of a large amount of data, which is important for precision measurements or for observing very rare decays. However, the energy of the bunches is limited due to losses from synchrotron radiation. In linear colliders, particles move in a straight line and therefore do not suffer from synchrotron radiation, but bunches cannot be re- used and it is therefore more challenging to collect large amounts of data. As a circular lepton collider, LEP was well suited for precision measurements of the electroweak interaction at energies that were not previously achievable. History Construction of the LEP was significant undertaking. Between 1983‚Äì1988, it was the largest civil engineering project in Europe. When the LEP collider started operation in August 1989 it accelerated the electrons and positrons to a total energy of 45 GeV each to enable production of the Z boson, which has a mass of 91 GeV. The accelerator was upgraded later to enable production of a pair of W bosons, each having a mass of 80 GeV. LEP collider energy eventually topped at 209 GeV at the end in 2000. At a Lorentz factor ( = particle energy/rest mass = [104.5 GeV/0.511 MeV]) of over 200,000, LEP still holds the particle accelerator speed record, extremely close to the limiting speed of light. At the end of 2000, LEP was shut down and then dismantled in order to make room in the tunnel for the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Operation An old RF cavity from LEP, now on display at the Microcosm exhibit at CERN LEP was fed with electrons and positrons delivered by CERN's accelerator complex. The particles were generated and initially accelerated by the LEP Pre-Injector, and further accelerated to nearly the speed of light by the Proton Synchrotron and the Super Proton Synchrotron. From there, they were injected into the LEP ring. As in all ring colliders, the LEP's ring consisted of many magnets which forced the charged particles into a circular trajectory (so that they stay inside the ring), RF accelerators which accelerated the particles with radio frequency waves, and quadrupoles that focussed the particle beam (i.e. keep the particles together). The function of the accelerators was to increase the particles' energies so that heavy particles can be created when the particles collide. When the particles were accelerated to maximum energy (and focused to so-called bunches), an electron and a positron bunch were made to collide with each other at one of the collision points of the detector. When an electron and a positron collide, they annihilate to a virtual particle, either a photon or a Z boson. The virtual particle almost immediately decays into other elementary particles, which are then detected by huge particle detectors. Detectors The Large Electron‚ÄìPositron Collider had four detectors, built around the four collision points within underground halls. Each was the size of a small house and was capable of registering the particles by their energy, momentum and charge, thus allowing physicists to infer the particle reaction that had happened and the elementary particles involved. By performing statistical analysis of this data, knowledge about elementary particle physics is gained. The four detectors of LEP were called Aleph, Delphi, Opal, and L3. They were built differently to allow for complementary experiments. =ALEPH= ALEPH stands for Apparatus for LEP PHysics at CERN. The detector determined the mass of the W-boson and Z-boson to within one part in a thousand. The number of families of particles with light neutrinos was determined to be , which is consistent with the standard model value of 3. The running of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) coupling constant was measured at various energies and found to run in accordance with perturbative calculations in QCD. =DELPHI= DELPHI stands for DEtector with Lepton, Photon and Hadron Identification. =OPAL= OPAL stands for Omni-Purpose Apparatus for LEP. The name of the experiment was a play on words, as some of the founding members of the scientific collaboration which first proposed the design had previously worked on the JADE detector at DESY in Hamburg. OPAL was a general-purpose detector designed to collect a broad range of data. Its data were used to make high precision measurements of the Z boson lineshape, perform detailed tests of the Standard Model, and place limits on new physics. The detector was dismantled in 2000 to make way for LHC equipment. The lead glass blocks from the OPAL barrel electromagnetic calorimeter are currently being re-used in the large-angle photon veto detectors at the NA62 experiment at CERN. =L3= L3 was another LEP experiment. Its enormous octagonal magnet return yoke remained in place in the cavern and became part of the ALICE detector for the LHC. Results The results of the LEP experiments allowed precise values of many quantities of the Standard Model‚Äîmost importantly the mass of the Z boson and the W boson (which were discovered in 1983 at an earlier CERN collider, the Proton-Antiproton Collider) to be obtained‚Äîand so confirm the Model and put it on a solid basis of empirical data. A not quite discovery of the Higgs boson Near the end of the scheduled run time, data suggested tantalizing but inconclusive hints that the Higgs particle of a mass around 115 GeV might have been observed, a sort of Holy Grail of current high-energy physics. The run- time was extended for a few months, to no avail. The strength of the signal remained at 1.7 standard deviations which translates to the 91% confidence level, much less than the confidence expected by particle physicists to claim a discovery, and was at the extreme upper edge of the detection range of the experiments with the collected LEP data. There was a proposal to extend the LEP operation by another year in order to seek confirmation, which would have delayed the start of the LHC. However, the decision was made to shut down LEP and progress with the LHC as planned. For years, this observation was the only hint of a Higgs Boson; subsequent experiments until 2010 at the Tevatron had not been sensitive enough to confirm or refute these hints. Beginning in July 2012, however, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at LHC presented evidence of a Higgs particle around 125 GeV, and strongly excluded the 115 GeV region.

Professional cooking, 7th ed., John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p. 71 This facilitates unattended cooking for many hours of dishes that would otherwise be boiled: pot roast, soups, stews and other dishes (including beverages, desserts and dips). A wide variety of dishes can be prepared in slow cookers, including ones typically made quickly, such as cocoa and bread. History The Naxon Utilities Corporation of Chicago, under the leadership of electrical engineer Irving Naxon (born Irving Nachumsohn), developed the Naxon Beanery All-Purpose Cooker for the purposes of cooking a bean meal. Naxon was inspired by a story his grandmother told about how back in her native Lithuanian town, her mother made a stew called cholent, a traditional Jewish stew, which took several hours to cook in an oven.Naxon, Lenore. \\"My Dad, the Inventor of the Crock Pot.\\" Beyond Bubbie. 8 April 2013. 2 May 2013. A 1950 advertisement shows a slow cooker called the \\"Simmer Crock\\" made by the Industrial Radiant Heat Corp. of Gladstone, NJ. The Rival Company from Sedalia, Missouri, bought Naxon in 1970, acquiring Naxon‚Äôs 1940 patent for the bean simmer cooker. Rival asked inventor Robert Glen Martin, from Boonville, Missouri, to develop Naxon‚Äôs bean cooker into a large scale production model which could cook an entire family meal, going further than just cooking a bean meal. Martin also designed and produced the mass-making machines for Rival‚Äôs manufacturing line of the Crock-Pot. The cooker was then reintroduced under the name \\"Crock-Pot\\" in 1971. Slow cookers achieved popularity in the US during the 1940s, when many women began to work outside the home. They could start dinner cooking in the morning before going to work and finish preparing the meal in the evening when they came home. In 1974, Rival introduced removable stoneware inserts, making the appliance easier to clean. The brand now belongs to Sunbeam Products, a subsidiary of Jarden Corporation. Other brands of this appliance include Cuisinart, GE, Hamilton Beach, KitchenAid, Magic Chef, West Bend Housewares, and the now defunct American Electric Corporation. Design A new slow cooker. This one has a removable ceramic \\"crock\\" (upper left), glass lid (lower left), and heater‚Äìhousing (right) with push button controls, instead of the original single knob. An oval-shaped slow cooker with button controls and a digital timer A basic slow cooker consists of a lidded round or oval cooking pot made of glazed ceramic or porcelain, surrounded by a housing, usually metal, containing an electric heating element. The lid itself is often made of glass, and seated in a groove in the pot edge; condensed vapor collects in the groove and provides a low-pressure seal to the atmosphere. The contents of a crock pot are effectively at atmospheric pressure, despite the water vapor generated inside the pot. A slow cooker is quite different from a pressure cooker and presents no danger of an abrupt pressure release. The \\"crock,\\" or ceramic pot, itself acts as both a cooking container and a heat reservoir. Slow cookers come in capacities from to . Because the heating elements are generally located at the bottom and often also partway up the sides, most slow cookers have a minimum recommended liquid level to avoid uncontrolled heating. Some newer models have coated aluminum or steel \\"crocks\\" which, while not as efficient as ceramic at retaining heat, does allow for quicker heating and cooling as well as the ability to use the \\"crock\\" on the stove top to brown meat prior to cooking. Many slow cookers have two or more heat settings (e.g., low, medium, high, and sometimes a \\"keep warm\\" setting); some have continuously variable power. In the past, most slow cookers had no temperature control and deliver a constant heat to the contents. The temperature of the contents rises until it reaches boiling point, at which point the energy goes into gently boiling the liquid closest to the hot surface. At a lower setting, it may just simmer at a temperature below the boiling point. While many basic slow cookers still operate in this manner, newer models have computerized controls for precise temperature control, delayed cooking starts and even control via a computer or mobile device. Operation To use a slow cooker, the cook places raw food and a liquid, such as stock, water, or wine, in the slow cooker. Some recipes call for pre-heated liquid. The cook puts the lid on the slow cooker and turns it on. Some cookers automatically switch from cooking to warming (maintaining the temperature at after a fixed time or after the internal temperature of the food, as determined by a probe, reaches a specified value. Heating element heats the contents to a steady temperature in the range. The contents are enclosed by the crock and the lid, and attain an essentially constant temperature. The vapor that is produced at this temperature condenses on the bottom of the lid and returns as liquid, into which some water-soluble vitamins are leached. The liquid transfers heat from the pot walls to its contents, and also distributes flavors. The slow cooker's lid is essential to prevent the warm vapor from escaping, taking heat with it and cooling the contents. Basic cookers, which have only high, medium, low, or keep warm settings, must be turned on and off manually. More advanced cookers have computerized timing devices that let a cook program the cooker to perform multiple operations (e.g., two hours high, followed by two hours low, followed by warm) and to delay the start of cooking. Because food cooked in a slow cooker stays warm for a long time after it is switched off, people can use the slow cookers to take food elsewhere to eat without reheating. Some slow cookers have lids that seal to prevent their contents from spilling during transport. Recipes Recipes intended for other cooking methods must be modified for slow cookers. Quantities of liquids may need adjustment, as there is a little evaporation, but there should be enough liquid to cover the food. Many published recipes for slow cookers are designed primarily for convenience and use few ingredients, and often use prepared sauces or seasonings. The long, moist cooking is particularly suitable for tough and cheap cuts of meat including pork shoulder, beef chuck and brisket. For many slow-cooked dishes, these cuts give better results than more expensive ones. They are also often used to cook while no one is there to care for it, meaning the cook can fill the pot with its ingredients and come back several hours later to a ready meal. Advantages Cheaper cuts of meat with connective tissue and lean muscle fibers are suitable for stewing, and produce tastier stews than those using expensive cuts, as long slow cooking softens connective tissue without toughening the muscle. Slow cooking leaves gelatinized tissue in the meat, so that it may be advantageous to start with a richer liquid. The low temperature of slow-cooking makes it almost impossible to burn; even food that has been cooked too long. However, some meats and most vegetables become nearly tasteless or \\"raggy\\" if over-cooked. Food can be set to slow-cook before leaving for the day so it is ready on return. Many homeowners with rooftop solar panels switch to slow cooking because it draws under 1 kW of power and can therefore be powered entirely by 1-2 kW panels during the day. Some models include timers or thermostats that bring food to a given temperature and then lower it. With a timerless cooker it is possible to use an external timer to stop cooking after a set time, or both to start and stop. Cooking the meal in a single pot reduces water waste resulting from cleaning multiple dishes, and the low cooking temperature and glazed pot make cleaning easier than conventional high-heat pots. Disadvantages Some vitamins and other trace nutrients are lost, particularly from vegetables, partially by enzyme action during cooking and partially due to heat degradation. When vegetables are cooked at higher temperatures these enzymes are rapidly denatured and have less time to act during cooking. Since slow cookers work at temperatures well below boiling point and do not rapidly denature enzymes, vegetables tend to lose trace nutrients. Blanched vegetables, having been exposed to very hot water, have already had these enzymes rendered largely ineffective, so a blanching or sauteing pre-cook stage leaves more vitamins intact. This is often a smaller nutrient loss than over-boiling and can be lessened to an extent by not removing the lid until the food is done. Slow cookers do not provide sufficient heat to compensate for loss of moisture and heat due to frequent removal of the lid, e.g., to add and remove food in perpetual stews, (pot-au-feu, olla podrida). Added ingredients must be given time to cook before the food can be eaten. Because of the longer cooking time, there is greater danger with slow cookers of having an extended power outage during cooking without the cook's knowledge; for example, the power may go out for several hours while the cook is away at work in places with unreliable power supply. Hazards =Scalding= Slow cookers are less dangerous than ovens or stove tops due to their lower operating temperatures and closed lids. However, they still contain a large amount of foods and liquids at temperatures close to boiling, and they can cause serious scalds if spilled. =Poisoning concerns= Raw kidney beans, and, to a lesser extent, some other such beans as broad beans or fava beans, contain the highly toxic lectin phytohemagglutinin. Boiling destroys this lectin, but the far lower temperature of a slow cooker does not. This means that dry beans must be boiled at for at least 30 minutes prior to slow cooking, or, alternatively, they must be soaked in water overnight, after which the water must be discarded, and the beans must then be boiled for at least 10 minutes. Even a few beans can be toxic, and beans can be as much as five times more toxic if cooked at than if eaten raw, so adequate pre-boiling is vital to avoid phytohemagglutinin poisoning. The risk can be avoided entirely by using canned beans which will have already been cooked and are suitable for eating immediately.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 9, 2001. The plot centers on an accidental time travel event that results in the main characters participating in the Roswell UFO Incident in 1947. The episode was written by J. Stewart Burns and directed by Rich Moore. \\"Roswell That Ends Well\\" scored a Nielsen rating of 3.1 during its original broadcast, and it received acclaim from television critics, with many hailing it as one of the best episodes of Futurama. It won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (Programming Less Than One Hour) in 2002. Plot As the crew watch a supernova, Fry puts a metal pan of popcorn into the ship's microwave oven. The radiation causes the pan to emit sparks, which interact with the particles thrown off by the supernova and send the ship back to 1947. Since GPS technology does not yet exist in this time period, the crew have no way to navigate the ship accurately and crash-land in Roswell, New Mexico. Refusing to wear a seat belt like the rest of the crew, Bender is flung through the windshield on impact and smashed to pieces. The crew and Bender's disembodied head seek out a way to return to the 31st century, leaving Zoidberg behind to pick up the pieces. Zoidberg is captured by the U.S. military and taken to Roswell Air Base for experimentation. Assuming the pieces are the remnants of a flying saucer, the military \\"reconstructs\\" Bender's body as such. Meanwhile, the microwave oven needed to return to the future has been destroyed and a replacement is not yet commercially available. A microwave antenna from the army base would work as a viable alternative, but Professor Farnsworth warns that stealing it could change history. He likewise warns Fry against visiting his grandfather, Enos, who is stationed at the base, as he might kill Enos and erase his own existence. However, Farnsworth's advice has the opposite effect; Fry becomes determined to seek out Enos and encourage him to pursue a sexual relationship with his fianc√©e Mildred. After several bumbling attempts to keep Enos safe, Fry resorts to locking him in an abandoned house. The house turns out to be located in the middle of a nuclear weapon testing range, and Enos is killed in a bomb test. When Fry visits Mildred to console her on Enos' death, she begins to seduce him. Realizing that his existence has not been erased, he concludes that she cannot be his grandmother. The two have sex that night and are found by the rest of the crew the following morning. Seeing that Mildred has begun to act like his grandmother, Fry realizes to his horror that he has now become his own grandfather. With time running out, Farnsworth decides that secrecy is no longer important and the crew storm Roswell Air Base by force to get the microwave dish, throwing the entire complex into disarray. Fry and Leela rescue Zoidberg from an alien autopsy while Farnsworth grabs Bender's body. As the ship leaves Earth's atmosphere and triggers the microwave dish for the time jump, Bender's head falls out and has to be left behind in 1947. Back in the 31st century, Fry laments the loss of Bender, until he realizes that his head must still be where it landed in New Mexico. The crew return to Roswell's ruins with a metal detector and dig up the head, still intact and functioning. They attach it to Bender's still-mangled, hovering, \\"UFO\\" body and return to New New York, content that their misadventures in 1947 have not changed history in any way. Production The writing team came up with the idea for this episode when they were planning the three plot lines for \\"Anthology of Interest II\\". As the idea developed they eventually had so much material for it that they broke it out as a separate episode. The reason the concept was originally under consideration for the \\"What if...\\" scenario was that when Groening and Cohen originally created Futurama they decided there would not be any time travel; however they changed their mind and decided to go forward with the idea. The writers did not want to create a situation that would leave fans wondering why the Planet Express crew could not simply travel through time on a regular basis. For this purpose they chose to have it occur unintentionally during a supernova as that was deemed to be a suitably rare occurrence. Futurama has returned to the theme of time travel twice since; in Futurama: Bender's Big Score, although the cause of time travel is different, and in \\"The Late Philip J. Fry\\", which involves a time machine that can only travel forwards in time ‚Äì to specifically avoid creating a paradox. In this episode, director Rich Moore used screen position and character movement to mimic the time travel aspects of the plot. In the planning stages it was decided that actions that played to screen left would represent events from the past or a setback to the plot. Likewise, screen right indicated progress or moving past their problems. Cultural references TV critic Rob Owen perceived the episode to have touched upon many of the plot devices and themes commonly seen in time travel stories, most notably the Back to the Future and Terminator movies. The episode also shares much in common with the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Little Green Men\\". Bender's head lying buried in the sand for centuries recalls the same thing happening to the android Data's head in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Time's Arrow\\". Much of Enos' character is taken from Gomer Pyle, such as his accent and use of Pyle's trademark \\"Go-oooly!\\", which was parodied as \\"Gadzooks!\\". Broadcast and reception The episode won an Emmy Award in the Outstanding Animated Program (Programming Less Than One Hour) category in 2002, marking Futurama's first win in this category. Rich Moore also won an Annie Award for \\"Directing in an Animated Television Production\\" in 2002 and in 2006, IGN ranked the episode as the sixth best Futurama episode. In 2013, they reassessed the list and upgraded it to third best. In 2001, executive producer David X. Cohen noted that this was one of his favorite episodes of the series. Sci Fi Weekly gave the episode an \\"A\\" grade and noted that it was \\"a half hour of pure entertainment\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A. This episode is one of four featured in the Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection, marking it as one of Matt Groening's favorite episodes from the series. Claudia Katz, producer of Futurama, has also stated that this is one of her three favorite episodes of the series. In 2013, it was ranked number 5 \\"as voted on by fans\\" for Comedy Central's Futurama Fanarama marathon. Although the episode was well received by critics, it continued to do poorly in its time slot. The original airing was in 83rd place for the week with a 3.1 rating/5 share.

It has a population of over 25,000 inhabitants. Bushey Heath is a large neighbourhood south east of Bushey on the boundary with the London Borough of Harrow reaching elevations of above sea level.OS Explorer Map 173, 2010 edition History The first written record of Bushey is an account in the Domesday Book, which describes a small agricultural village named 'Bissei' (which later became 'Biss(h)e' and then 'Bisheye' during the 12th century). However, chance archaeological findings of Stone Age tools provide evidence that the area was inhabited as far back as the Palaeolithic period. The town also has links to the Roman occupation of Britain, with the main road running through it being Roman; sites of possible Roman villas being unearthed in the area; and a Roman tessellated pavement was discovered near Chiltern Avenue. St. James's Church, Bushey The origin of the town's name is not fully known. In terms of the original name, \\"Bissei,\\" an early theory in Reverend J.B. Johnstone's book The Place-Names of England and Wales states that it may have meant \\"Byssa's Isle,\\" and it started life as a lake-village surrounded by marshes, streams and lakes. A more modern theory (but less romantic) is that it is simply derived from the Old English word bysce and Old French boisseie, meaning a 'place covered with wood'. The latter theory could prove more apt, as the town is located in the valleys which extend southwards from the Chiltern Hills, which were once covered in dense forests of oak, elm, ash, hazel and juniper. Bushey Heath's story begins in the Napoleonic Wars during a large food shortage. To help solve the problem, the government awarded the waste land to the east of Bushey to Bushey landowners to be used as farming; the land was more generally known as Bushey Common. Whilst the original aim was to produce food, being close to a railway and up to 500 ft above sea level with beautiful and broad views made the area attractive for housing developers. The 19th and 20th centuries marked the time of most change in Bushey, especially between 1860 and 1960. The population rose 28-fold within 200 years, from 856 in 1801, to just under 24,000 today. The expansion was for many reasons, one of the main ones being due to the boom in industry caused by the railway in the early 20th century. A result was that many new jobs were created in and around Watford, and in the early 1920s, Bushey's first council houses were built. More housing was later built for the service families working in defence organisations in Stanmore and Northwood. The expansion eventually died down because much of the land in and around Bushey was protected under the Metropolitan Green Belt after the Second World War. This same Green Belt legislation was also partly responsible for the abandonment of the pre-war Edgware to Bushey Heath extension as part of the Northern Heights programme of the Northern line underground railway. The Metropolitan Green Belt put great restrictions on new development, and the plan was to use the new railway to stimulate new housing around the new route; without the new housing the route was deemed no longer viable. However, as work was advanced at the onset of war, the depot was completed for use as bomber manufacture, and following the Second World War and Green Belt coming into force, it was converted into the Aldenham bus depot (of Cliff Richard's Summer Holiday fame), which it remained until 1985, when it became derelict. It was redeveloped in 1996 and is now the Centennial Park Industrial Estate (). Bushey Heath station would have been located at the intersection of Elstree Road and Northwestern Avenue (). Conceptual plans existed in the 1903 Act of Parliament for an Edgware to Watford railway that would have seen the railway extended at a later date though Bushey village and on to Watford market, but even less came of that than the partially completed Edgware to Bushey Heath stretch. The highest point in the historic county of Middlesex was in Bushey Heath on the border between Hertfordshire and Middlesex at the junction of the A4140 and the A409. At 153 m (502 ft) above sea level, the grid reference was TQ 152937. =Stories, legends and folklore= The lack of farming in Bushey Heath meant that it was a heavily wooded area up to the 18th century; this, added to the lack of street lighting and police, meant that Bushey Heath's history is full of tales of thieves, highwaymen and even murder. According to Grant Longman's Robberies on Bushey Heath, the road from Bushey Heath to Stanmore is said to be where the highwaymen lurked, ready to raid the dozen or so caravans that passed through Bushey Heath daily, carrying money from trade in London. Before venturing through the pass, parties of travellers and merchants would form at the Boot Inn at Edgware and the Three Crowns at Bushey Heath so they did not have to venture through the pass alone. Although one of the highwaymen responsible for the attacks is rumoured to have been the notorious Dick Turpin, evidence suggests that he was in fact more active in the region of Essex. Local government Bushey was an ancient civil parish. It was subdivided by the Local Government Act 1894 into two: the part which was within the Watford urban district became the 'Bushey Urban' parish and the part which was outside, in the Watford Rural District, became 'Bushey Rural' parish. Subsequently, in 1906, the Bushey Urban parish was renamed Oxhey, and the Bushey Rural parish was split off from the Watford Rural District as the new Bushey Urban District. Modern day High Street, Bushey Despite being close to London and having Watford on its doorstep Bushey retains the feeling of a small town and this is reinforced with events such as the Bushey Festival and quarter marathon which is held each July and the Horticultural Society's flower and produce show. Being located near several film studios at Elstree and Borehamwood, Bushey and Bushey Heath frequently feature as backdrops for many film and TV shows. Most notable is a bus scene in the Cannon and Ball film, and in the 1957 film Lucky Jim. Several historic buildings in Bushey, notably the old Royal Masonic School for Boys, later the International University, in the Avenue, have been used in films over a long period of time, including, Nuns on the Run, Out of Bounds, Children of Men and Harry Potter. and also the comedy series Little Britain. It has also been the set for several television series, including Monty Python's Flying Circus and Little Britain. This site is currently being redeveloped for residential usage, with the 1960s additions to the site having been demolished. Many of The Avengers episodes include location shots around the Bushey area, and the latter half of the Confessions of a Driving Instructor is entirely shot on the roads between Elstree and Bushey, finishing in the car dump at 'Bushey Breakers'. The University of London, located in the Bushey area has been used in the filming of BBC's Grange Hill and also for various other programmes, such as family business. Pupils from local schools including Bushey Hall and Bushey Meads have taken part as extras in productions such as My Dad's the Prime Minister. Bushey Heath is home to a duck pond, (Warren Lake) which was restored in 1992 after falling into dereliction. Schools The area contains a mix of primary schools and linked infants and junior schools (see schools in Bushey). The state secondary schools are Queens' School, Bushey Meads School and The Grange Academy, of which the first two generally do well in comparison with other schools in the county. Bushey is also the site of the famous Purcell School, a school for young musicians well known for turning out many successful musicians. It was formerly the Royal Caledonian School. There are also two private girls' schools, St. Hilda's and St Margaret's in the area. Herkomer's Art School Hubert Herkomer was a poor immigrant from Bavaria, who moved to Bushey in 1874, and ended life in 1914 as Sir Hubert von Herkomer RA CVO. Herkomer had visited a friend who lived in Bushey in 1873, and returned to rent a pair of cottages and a studio near Melbourne Road. He founded Herkomer's Art School at Bushey in 1883, which, in its 21-year life, attracted some 500 students to the area, some of whom stayed after establishing their own studios. Their paintings are on display in the Bushey Museum. A street, Herkomer Road, was named in his memory. At around 1888, he built Lululaund (), a 'Bavarian castle', which was named after his second wife Lulu Griffiths. After being married for only a year she died. Lululaund dominated the Bushey skyline until 1939 when it was almost entirely demolished; a lot of the building was used as hardcore for Bovingdon Airfield, and much of the woodwork and carvings from the castle were burnt. In 2014 the surviving remnant of Lululaund was converted into luxury apartments. Sir Hubert is mainly remembered as an artist today, but in his time he was a polymath, becoming involved in some of the earliest film productions in Europe, and starting a series of races and time trials for cars in Germany. In 1904 Herkomer closed his school and sold the building. The school was re- opened in 1905 on the same site by the artist Lucy Kemp-Welch as the Bushey School of Painting. In 1912 Herkomer bought back the school building and demolished it. A rose garden was laid out on the site to a design by T.H. Mawson. It is listed grade II on the Register of Parks and Gardens. There is a gallery named after Kemp-Welch close to the village church. It is more usually used as a village hall today, with occasional exhibitions such as one in September 2006 by students from the Chelsea College of Art. Film studios Bushey Film Studios in Melbourne Road were originally built by Hubert Herkomer and operated between 1913 and 1985. For much of its existence the studios focused on low-budget productions. Jewish cemeteries There are two Jewish cemeteries, serving a sector of north-west London. Bushey 'Old' Cemetery is at Little Bushey Lane and Bushey 'New' Cemetery is along the same road. Both are active for funerals, stone-settings and visiting. In 2018 a ¬£6.12 m extension was built, as the 43,000 grave spaces in the old cemetery were nearly full, and another 17,000 were thought necessary to provide for the next 50 years. of new land were laid out by the landscape architects J and L Gibbons, with two prayer halls, offices and a mortuary. There are also separate rooms for the Cohanim, who are not permitted to be in the same space as the coffin, but may view proceedings through glass walls.

They first appeared in North America in the middle Eocene (around 45 mya), spread to Europe by the late Eocene (35 mya), and appear in Asia, and Africa by the early Miocene (23 mya). They had largely disappeared worldwide by the late Miocene (8 mya), with the latest recorded species at the end of the Miocene in Pakistan. They were among the first carnivorans to evolve large body size. Later in their history, they came into competition with hesperocyonine and borophagine canids. As dogs evolved similar body sizes and cranial and dental adaptations, the rise of these groups may have led to their extinction. Amphicyonids are often colloquially referred to as \\"bear- dogs\\". Taxonomy Restoration of Amphicyon ingens The family was erected by Haeckel (1886) [also attributed to Trouessart (1885)]. Their exact position has long been disputed. Some early paleontologists defined them as members of the family Canidae, but the modern consensus is that they form their own family. Some researchers have defined it as the sister clade to ursids (bears), based on morphological analysis of the ear region.R. M. Hunt. 2001. Small Oligocene amphicyonids from North America (Paradaphoenus, Mammalia, Carnivora). American Museum Novitates 3331:1-20 However, cladistic analysis and reclassification of several species of early carnivore as amphicyonids has strongly suggested that they may be basal caniforms, from lineages older than the origin of both bears and dogs.M. Morlo, E. R. Miller, and A. N. El- Barkooky. 2007. Creodonta and Carnivora from Wadi Moghra, Egypt. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 27(1):145-159 Description Amphicyonids ranged in size from as small as and as large as Sorkin, B. 2008: A biomechanical constraint on body mass in terrestrial mammalian predators. Lethaia, Vol. 41, pp. 333‚Äì347. and evolved from wolf-like to bear-like body forms.Jacobs, Louis L. Jacobs; Scott, Kathleen Marie: Evolution of Tertiary Mammals of North America: Terrestrial carnivores, Cambridge University Press, 1998 Early amphicyonids, such as Daphoenodon, possessed a digitigrade posture and locomotion (walking on their toes), while many of the later and larger species were plantigrade or semiplantigrade.Wang, Xiaoming and Tedford, Richard H. Dogs: Their Fossil Relatives and Evolutionary History. New York: Columbia University Press, 2008. p10-11, 29 The amphicyonids were obligate carnivores, unlike the Canidae, which are hypercarnivores or mesocarnivores. There is often some confusion with the similar looking (and similarly named) \\"dog- bears\\", a more derived group of caniforms that is sometimes classified as a family (Hemicyonidae), but is more often considered a primitive subfamily of ursids (Hemicyoninae). Evolution It has long been uncertain where amphicyonids originated. It was thought that they may have crossed from Europe to North America during the Miocene epoch, but recent research suggests a possible North American origin from the miacids Miacis cognitus and M. australis (now renamed as the genera Gustafsonia and Angelarctocyon, respectively). As these are of North American origin, but appear to be early amphicyonids, it may be that the Amphicyonidae actually originates in North America.Tomiya S., and Tseng Z. J. 2016 Whence the beardogs?

DOI: 10.1098/rsos.160518 http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/10/160518 During the early Miocene, a number of large amphicyonids are thought to have migrated from Eurasia into North America. These taxa belong to the Old World amphicyonid subfamily Amphicyoninae. The earliest to appear is the large bear dog Ysengrinia Ginsburg, followed by Cynelos Jourdan, and then by Amphicyon.Hunt, Robert M, Jr. (2004) \\"Global Climate and the Evolution of Large Mammalian Carnivores during the Later Cenozoic in North America\\" in Cenozoic Carnivores and Global Climate by Robert M. Hunt, Jr. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History (285) 139-285Hunt, Robert M, Jr. 2003. Intercontinental Migration of Large Mammalian Carnivores: Earliest Occurrence of the Old World Beardog Amphicyon (Carnivora, Amphicyonidae) in North America. Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History (279) 77-115 This influx of amphicyonines, accompanied by Old World ungulates and small mammals, indicates a prolonged interval (from 23 to 16.5 Mya) of faunal exchange between Asia and North America in the early Miocene, using the trans-Beringian route. New World daphoenines (Daphoenodon, Borocyon) and temnocyonines coexisted with Old World amphicyonines 23.7 to 17.5 million years ago. With estimated weights of , these were the largest terrestrial carnivorans to have evolved on the North American continent up to this time. Other New World amphicyonids include the oldest known amphicyonid, Daphoenus (37‚Äì16 Mya). Amphicyonids began to decline in the late Miocene, and disappeared by the end of the epoch. The reasons for this are unclear; possibly it was due to competition with other carnivorans, as large canids had better adaptations to pursue swift prey in open country, a habitat which spread globally as the new grassland biome replaced more closed environments. However, no direct evidence for this idea has been found. The most recent known amphicyonid remains are teeth known from the Dhok Pathan horizon, northern Pakistan, dating to 7.4-5.3 mya. The species is classically named Arctamphicyon lydekkeri, which may actually be synonymous with a species of Amphicyon.

The neighbourhood  The Skejby neighbourhood comprise a large business park, an industrial park, a regional hospital, and several major institutions for education and business. Residential areas forms a large part of Skejby east of the expressway of Randersvej, while the old village is the only residential area west of the expressway, with the exception of a few new apartment blocks near nature site Vestereng. Business Park Skejby stretches south from the village of Skejby towards Aarhus and continues into the neighbourhood of Christiansbjerg. In Skejby, it contains the Agro Food Park, with a focus on agriculture and foodstuff, and offices and business headquarters for companies such as Vestas, Ramb√∏ll, IBM, TDC Hosting and NRGi. The headquarters of INCUBA Science Park, the educational institution of Professionsh√∏jskolen VIA University College is also located here. The New University Hospital (DNU) was built in Skejby in the years 2012-2018 and is absorbing all other hospital departments across Aarhus, to be fully functional in 2020. The new hospital complex includes a psychiatric department and the only emergency and trauma center in Aarhus. East of the expressway of Randersvej, in a low-rise residential area, is the mall of Skejby Centret and the headquarters of the television company department TV 2/√òstjylland. North of here is a lightweight industrial park stretching eastward into the neighbourhood of Vejlby. The industrial park comprise large store departments of ILVA, IKEA and Silvan Byggemarked, and a number of mixed industries, offices and warehouse facilities. The woodland of Mollerup Skov in the east, connects with the nature site of Eg√• Engs√∏.  Aarhus light rail  The first leg of Aarhus light rail was inaugurated in December 2017 and connects the inner city to Skejby, continuing north to Lisbjerg. There is a station at the new AU Hospital.

They are best known for their flight endurance record, which they cemented at twenty-seven days. They also invented a valve for aerial refueling that became the industry standard for the United States military. Early history and record attempt Brothers Fred and Al Key became interested in aviation after World War I. They started doing some barnstorming in the 1920s and continued their interest as the managers of the Meridian Municipal Airport, in Meridian, Mississippi. With the onset of the Great Depression, the city of Meridian began doing whatever it could to save money. The airport was considered unnecessary, given the economic conditions, and was slated to be closed. The Key brothers had no desire to see this happen, so they came up with a plan to draw attention to Meridian and its airport by breaking the standing flight endurance record of 23 days. At that time, air-to-air refueling was a dangerous affair. If gasoline was spilled, which often happened, it could be ignited by the hot engine exhaust. To solve this problem, the Key brothers, along with local inventor and mechanic A. D. Hunter, invented a spill-free fueling system that consisted of a valve on the end of the fuel nozzle which was opened by a probe in the neck of the fuel tank. The valve would not allow fuel to flow unless it was inserted into the fuel tank. During fueling, if the nozzle was removed from the tank, the fuel would automatically stop flowing. This nozzle was later adopted by the US Army Air Corps, and is still in use today with some modifications. Refueling the plane wasn't their only concern. The engine needed regular maintenance during the flight in order to stay in good running order. To facilitate this, a catwalk was built so that Fred could walk out and work on the plane while it was airborne. On June 4, 1935, The Flying Keys, as the brothers later became known, lifted off in a borrowed Curtiss Robin monoplane named Ole Miss from Meridian, Mississippi's airport. For the next twenty-seven days, they flew over the Meridian vicinity. Several times each day, the crew of a similar plane would lower food and supplies to the brothers on the end of a rope, as well as supply fuel via a long flexible tube. They landed on July 1 after traveling an estimated 52,320 miles and used more than 6,000 gallons of gasoline. Their non-stop endurance flight lasted 653 hours, 34 minutes. The Ole Miss is permanently displayed in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.. After this historic flight, Meridian's public airport was renamed Key Field in the brothers' honor. According to Owen, the brothers' flight boosted confidence in aviation nationally. People figured if the Key brothers made their flight safely in such a small plane, then the big commercial airplanes were definitely safe. World War II The Key brothers both served as bomber pilots during World War II. Fred was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (USA). Al was the Co of the 66th Squadron (part of the 44th Bombardment Group) flying Consolidated B-24 Liberators from England. By the time he was taken off combat missions in 1943 he had earned a Distinguished Flying Cross, Distinguished Service Cross, an Air Medal, a Distinguished Service Cross from the British and seven Bronze Stars for participating in combat. Postwar activities Al remained in the Air Force until his retirement in 1960 at the rank of full Colonel, after which he was elected mayor of Meridian in 1965 and 1969; he was unseated in 1973 by a Republican, Tom Stuart. Fred Key ran the Key Brothers Flying Service at Key Field until his death in 1971. The cutoff valve developed for the Keys by A.D. Hunter was an important innovation for national defense, being the precursor of those used by modern tanker airplanes, such as the KC-135 Stratotanker, that keep bombers and fighter aircraft in the air. Today, with only slight modifications, U.S. Air Force and Strategic Air Command airplanes use the valve that Hunter invented.

Its partially replace wages in the event a worker is unable to perform their work due to a disability. In some states, there are many types of organisations that provide different disability insurance. These organisations have specific definitions regarding what is a disability and how a person should qualify in order to receive the benefit. State disability insurance in the United States State disability insurance is provided in many states and in one commonwealth in United States. Disability insurance (also known as state disability insurance, statutory disability programs or state disability benefits) is a kind of insurance, which is funded by mandatory contribution of employees. Employees can lower the tax they have to pay to their state, by the fact that their contributions are tax-deductible. There is a difference between the states in details of the state disability insurance and tax-deductive. =Statutory disability insurance in New York State= In New York State, there is a disability benefits insurance, that provides temporary cash benefits paid to an eligible wage earner to partially replace wages lost, when he or she is disabled by an off-the-job illness or injury and as well as for disabilities arising from pregnancy. Who is required to provide state disability benefits insurance according to New York State disability insurance Each employer, who hires one and more employees on each of 30 days in any calendar year, is required to provide state disability benefits insurance for their employees. These employees have to provide it unless they are considered exempt. Among those employees, who are not considered exempt belongs * Each employer of one or more employees on each of 30 days in any calendar year becomes a \\"covered\\" employer four weeks after the 30th day of such employment. * Employees or recent employees of a \\"covered\\" employer, who have worked at least four consecutive weeks. * Employees of an employer who elects to provide benefits by filing an Application for Voluntary Coverage. * Employees who change jobs from one \\"covered\\" employer to another \\"covered\\" employer are protected from the first day on the new job. Generally, an eligible employee does not lose protection during the first 26 weeks of unemployment, provided he/she is eligible for and is claiming unemployment insurance benefits. * Domestic or personal employees who work 40 or more hours per week for one employer. Among those employees, who are considered exempt belongs * A minor child of the employer. * Government, railroad, maritime or farm laborers. * Ministers, priests, rabbis, members of religious orders, sextons, Christian Science readers. * Individuals that volunteer their services for nonprofit organizations and receive no compensation. Compensation includes stipends, room and board, and other \\"perks\\" that have monetary value. (Stipends used solely to offset expenses incurred while performing activities for the nonprofit are not counted as stipends.) * An executive officer of an incorporated religious, charitable or educational institution, and persons engaged in a professional or teaching capacity in or for a religious, charitable, or educational institution (Section 501(c)(3) under the IRS tax code), and persons receiving rehabilitation services in a sheltered workshop operated by such institutions under a certificate issued by the U.S. Department of Labor. * Persons receiving aid from a religious or charitable institution, who perform work in return for such aid. * One or two corporate officers who either singly or jointly own all of the stock and hold all of the offices of a corporation that employs no other employees. * Golf caddies. * Daytime students in elementary or secondary school, who work part-time during the school year or their regular vacation period. * Employees who change to jobs in an exempt employment or with a \\"non-covered\\" employer, and work in such employment for more than four weeks, lose protection until they work four consecutive weeks for a \\"covered\\" employer. Statutory disability insurance in the United Kingdom In the UK, people can apply for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) if they are under 16. If they are above 16, they can apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP). =Disability Living Allowance (DLA)= DLA is made up of two parts: the care component and the mobility component. The person can get DLA if they are eligible for at least one of the components. The person is eligible for the care component if they cannot do everyday tasks (e.g. washing, dressing, eating, using the toilet etc.) and there is no one who can care for them or if they live alone. There are three levels: lowest (for occasional help), middle (for frequent help or constant supervision), and highest (for nonstop supervision). The person is eligible for the mobility component if they have a walking disability, have no legs, are blind, are at least 80% deaf, have behavioural problems or need walking supervision. There are two levels: lower (for guidance or supervision outdoors) and higher (for more severe walking difficulties). =Personal Independence Payment (PIP)= Personal Independence Payment helps the person financially, if they have a chronic illness or if they are disabled. They receive between ¬£23.20 and ¬£148.85 per week if they are 16 or older and have not reached State Pension age. State disability insurance in the Czech Republic In the Czech Republic, prior to 2010, disabled people were divided into two categories based on the seriousness of their disability. These two categories were partial invalidity and full invalidity. Since 2010, there is just one category of benefits, the invalidity pension, which is divided into three degrees corresponding with the severity of the person's disability. The severity is measured by how disruptive the disability is. An invalid pension cannot be collected along with an old-age pension. Degrees of disability: * 35‚Äì49%: first degree disability * 50‚Äì69%: second degree disability * 70‚Äì100%: third degree disability =Conditions for reaching the invalidity pension= * They have any of the three disability degrees, which are mentioned above. * They are under 65. * They do not comply with the conditions for the purpose of obtaining a standard old-age pension. * They have previously completed the stipulated periods of pension insurance. The lowest amount of money they can receive in any degree of disability is CZK 770.00 (‚Ç¨30) per month. The base amount is CZK 2,700.00 (‚Ç¨105) per month. It is a fixed portion of an invalidity pension. Eligibility for an invalidity pension is based on a required term of insurance based on: the applicant's age required term of insurance: * Under 20: less than one year * 20‚Äì22: one year * 22‚Äì24: two years * 24‚Äì26: three years * 26‚Äì28: four years * Over 28: five years * Over 38: ten years For instance, if the person was born in 1953, their disability was recognized in 2014 and they are insured for 44 years, they get from the State Invalidity pension of CZK 13,262.00 (‚Ç¨516) per month.

Lewis, primarily in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe but also briefly in The Horse and His Boy and in The Last Battle. He is the first creature Lucy Pevensie meets in Narnia and becomes her fast friend. Lewis wrote that the first Narnia story, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, all came to him from a single picture he had in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels through a snowy wood. Tumnus thus became the initial inspiration for the entire Narnia series. C.S. Lewis. On Stories: And Other Essays on Literature. 1982, p. 53. Description Lewis describes Tumnus as having reddish skin, curly hair, brown eyes, a short pointed beard, horns on his forehead, cloven hooves, goat legs with glossy black hair, a \\"strange but pleasant little face,\\" a long tail, and being \\"only a little taller than Lucy herself.\\" Tumnus first appears when Lucy arrives in Narnia at the lamp-post. He invites her back to his cave for tea, during which, they talk about Narnia. Tumnus then plays his flute, and Lucy says that she has to go. When Lucy says that she has to go, he bursts into tears. He confesses that he is in the pay of the White Witch (Jadis), who rules Narnia and has made it always winter but never Christmas. She had ordered him and the other Narnians to hand over any Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve - humans - that he sees in Narnia. Tumnus, despite knowing that the Witch will find out and is likely to punish him severely if he disobeys her orders, quickly realizes that he can't bring himself to give up Lucy to the Witch, so he guides her back to the lamp-post to see that she returns safely to her own world. When Lucy returns to Narnia a few days later, Tumnus is still safe: evidently the White Witch hasn't discovered his disobedience. However, Lucy's brother Edmund enters Narnia shortly afterward and mentions to the White Witch that his sister had visited Narnia before and met a faun - even though he does not name the faun as Tumnus. When Lucy and her siblings subsequently come to Narnia, they find that Tumnus has been arrested by Maugrim, Chief of the White Witch's secret police, and is awaiting trial on a charge of high treason which involves harboring spies and fraternizing with humans. Tumnus had spoken to Mr. Beaver of his fears not long before his arrest and asked him to guide the four children if he found them in Narnia. The children meet Mr. Beaver just after leaving Tumnus's ransacked cave. Later in the story, when the winter has come to an end and Aslan is preparing an army to take on the White Witch, Lucy and Susan find Tumnus as a statue in the Witch's castle, and he is restored by Aslan. He follows the other Narnians to the battle as the Witch is defeated and killed. Years later, he is the one who tells the Kings and Queens that the White Stag has been spotted near his home. Their hunt for it leads to their disappearance from Narnia and the end of the Golden Age. In The Horse and His Boy, Tumnus appears as a royal adviser to the four Pevensie monarchs (fourteen years later, according to Lewis's Narnian Timeline). He devises a ruse for escaping from Calormen, thereby saving Queen Susan from being forcibly married to Prince Rabadash, and the other Narnians, including her brother Edmund, from certain death trying to defend her. He and Lucy eventually meet again in Aslan's Country in The Last Battle. Portrayals *He appeared in the 1967 TV serial and was portrayed by Angus Lennie. *He originally appeared in the 1988 BBC miniseries of The Chronicles of Narnia played by actor Jeffrey Perry. *Tumnus appears in the 2005 film The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Tumnus has light skin, blue eyes, brown legs, and a stubbly little tail. In this film he is the character that crowns the four Pevensie children at Cair Paravel. He was portrayed by actor James McAvoy. *He is voiced by Philip Sherlock in the Focus on the Family Radio Theatre adaptations.

He is married with 3 children. James Adamson flew on two missions, STS-28 and STS-43, and completed 263 orbits and 334 hours in space. After retiring from NASA, he was recruited by Allied Signal (later merged with Honeywell) where he retired in 2001. Adamson has logged over 3,000 hours in over 30 different types of helicopters and airplanes. Personal data Adamson was born March 3, 1946, in Warsaw, New York. He currently resides in Fishersville, Virginia with his wife Ellen and two of his three children.Astronaut Bio: James C. Adamson Education Adamson completed his Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army at United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1969. In 1977, he completed a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University. In 2010, he completed his Chartered Director certification, graduating from The Directors College (a joint venture between McMaster University and the Conference Board of Canada).The Directors College Additionally, he has completed undergraduate and graduate pilot training, paratrooper training, Arctic water and mountain survival training, nuclear weapons training, basic and advanced officer training, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Military experience As a military test pilot, Adamson has flown research aircraft at Edwards Air Force Base, Princeton University, West Point, Naval Air Station Patuxent River, and NASA Houston. During the Vietnam War, he flew in the IV Corps area and in Cambodia with the Air Cavalry as scout pilot, team lead, and air mission commander. He has also flown with several peacetime flight units at Fort Bliss, Texas, West Point and Houston, Texas. Following completion of his master's in aerospace engineering at Princeton University, he became assistant professor of aerodynamics at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. While at West Point, he developed and taught courses in fluid mechanics, aerodynamics, aircraft performance, and stability and control. He also developed flight laboratories in aircraft flight testing and completed a text on aircraft performance. In addition to being an experimental test pilot and Master Army Aviator, Adamson is also a certified professional engineer and licensed commercial pilot. In ground assignments with the Army, Adamson has commanded nuclear-capable missile units in Europe and in the United States. NASA experience Adamson was employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center from 1981 to 1992. During the Operational Flight Test phase of the Shuttle Program, he served as a research test pilot and aerodynamics officer in Mission Control. Following completion of the operational test flights he became guidance navigation and control officer for Shuttle Missions 5 through 11. As research test pilot he also conducted airborne remote sensing studies in biospheric research. Selected by NASA as an astronaut in 1984, Adamson became qualified for mission assignment on Space Shuttle flights. In November 1985, he was selected to the crew of a Department of Defense mission, which was subsequently delayed due to the Challenger accident. During the Shuttle Program reconstruction period, Adamson was one of eleven astronauts selected to hold management positions within NASA. He served as Shuttle Program Office Assistant Manager for Engineering Integration. In this position he was responsible for the initial development of a reliability based maintenance program for the Space Shuttle program. He also initiated an enhancements program for Shuttle ground processing. In February 1988 Adamson was assigned to the flight crew of STS-28, the first flight of Space Shuttle Columbia following the reconstruction period. Columbia launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on August 8, 1989. The mission carried a classified Department of Defense payload and a number of secondary payloads. After 80 earth orbits in 121 hours, this five-day mission concluded with a dry lakebed landing on Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 13, 1989. Following STS-28 Adamson once again returned to management. This time he was assigned to the Kennedy Space Center as Director of Shuttle Processing Analysis. He served in this post from September 1989 until October 1990 when he was assigned to the flight crew of STS-43. During this period Adamson developed risk based processing and scheduling programs which resulted in reduction of processing times from 80 days to 50 days. The nine-day STS-43 mission aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis launched from the Kennedy Space Center on August 2, 1991, setting a new world record for payload weight lifted to orbit. The five member crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-E) and conducted 32 physical and life sciences experiments. During this flight, Adamson performed the first flight test of the Orbital Digital Autopilot following Shuttle retrofit with new General Purpose Computers and new software. After 142 earth orbits in 213 hours, the STS-43 mission concluded with a landing on Runway 15 at the Kennedy Space Center on August 11, 1991. Following Adamson's retirement from government service in June 1992, he continued as a management consultant to NASA and the aerospace industry. Until September 1994 he served as management consultant and strategic planner for Lockheed Corporation in the area of Human Space Flight Operations. He was also selected by the NASA Administrator to serve on the NASA Advisory Council. In September 1994, Adamson joined Lockheed Corporation as Executive Vice President of Lockheed Engineering and Science Company (LESC) where he was shortly promoted to President and CEO. In late 1995 he was selected by Lockheed Martin to start up and become the first COO of the United Space Alliance (USA), a joint venture with Rockwell International. USA subsequently won the Space Flight Operations Contract with NASA to operate the Space Shuttle Program and grew to $1.5 billion annual revenue in the first year. In 1999, Adamson was recruited by AlliedSignal Corporation to be the President of Allied Signal Technical Services Corporation. He remained in that post through Allied Signal's merger with Honeywell until his retirement in March 2001. Adamson is still active as a consultant and board member for the aerospace industry and still serves on the NASA Advisory Council for the NASA Administrator. Honors and awards Adamson was recently awarded the \\"Gil Bennett Gold Standard Award\\" for corporate governance.Gil Bennett Winners In 2007 he was inducted into the Army Aviation Hall of Fame.Hall of Fame Adamson was a two time All-American in pistol competition. He was also a winner of the Army's Excellency In Competition Award, and a recipient of the George S. Patton Award. Named an Outstanding College Athlete of America, Adamson captained West Point's pistol team to the national championship in 1969. He was a distinguished graduate of his pilot training class, as well as his graduate fixed-wing and multi-engine pilot training classes. During aerial combat in Southeast Asia, he earned two Distinguished Flying Crosses, 18 Air Medals, and three Vietnam Crosses of Gallantry for valor. He has also earned the Defense Superior Service Medal, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, two Army Commendation Medals, the Bronze Star, NASA Exceptional Service Medal, two NASA Space Flight Medals, and is a world record holder for space flight lifting the most weight to orbit. He is a Charter Honoree of the Geneseo Central School Alumni Hall of Fame, Class of 1964. Adamson is an Eagle Scout.

No scientific evidence exists to support any beneficial health claims of urine therapy. History Though urine has been believed useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in several traditional systems, and mentioned in some medical texts, auto-urine therapy as a system of alternative medicine was popularized by British naturopath John W. Armstrong in the early 20th century. Armstrong was inspired by his family's practice of using urine to treat minor stings and toothaches, by a metaphorical reading of the Biblical Proverb 5:15 \\"Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well\\", and his own experience with ill-health that he treated with a 45-day fast \\"on nothing but urine and tap water\\". Starting in 1918, Armstrong prescribed urine-therapy regimens that he devised to many thousands of patients, and in 1944 he published The Water of Life: A treatise on urine therapy, which became a founding document of the field. Armstrong's book sold widely, and in India inspired the writing of Manav mootra (Gujarati: Urine therapy; 1959) by Gandhian social reformer Raojibhai Manibhai Patel, and many later works. These works often reference Shivambu Kalpa, a treatise on the pharmaceutical value of urine, as a source of the practice in the East. They also cite passing references to properties and uses of urine in Yogic-texts such as Vayavaharasutra by Bhadrabahu and Hatha Yoga Pradapika by Svatmarama; and Ayurvedic texts such as Sushruta Samhita, Bhava Prakasha and Harit. However, according to medical anthropologist Joseph Atler, the practices of sivambu (drinking one's own urine) and amaroli recommended by modern Indian practitioners of urine therapy are closer to the ones propounded by Armstrong than traditional ayurveda or yoga, or even the practices described in Shivambu Kalpa. Urine-therapy has also been combined with other forms of alternative medicine. For example, in her book Your Own Perfect Medicine: The Incredible Proven Natural Miracle Cure that Medical Science Has Never Revealed!, Martha M. Christy describes homeopathic preparations of urine and their uses, and says that they are \\"extremely potent\\". Modern claims and findings An exhaustive description of the composition of human urine was prepared for NASA in 1971. Urine is an aqueous solution of greater than 95% water. The remaining constituents are, in order of decreasing concentration: urea 9.3 g/L, chloride 1.87 g/L, sodium 1.17 g/L, potassium 0.750 g/L, creatinine 0.670 g/L and other dissolved ions, inorganic and organic compounds.David F. Putnam Composition and Concentrative Properties of Human Urine. NASA Contractor Report. July 1971Dan Nosowitz for Popular Science. September 5, 2013 What's in your Pee? In China there is a Urine Therapy Association which claims thousand of members. According to a BBC report, a Thai doctor promoting urine therapy said that Thai people had been practicing urophagia for a long time, but according to the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine, there was no record of the practice. Urinating on jellyfish, wasp or bee stings, sunburns, cuts, and blood vessel bursts is a common \\"folk remedy\\", however Scientific American reports that it may be counterproductive, as it can activate nematocysts remaining at the site of the sting, making the pain worse. Urine and urea have been claimed by some practitioners to have an anti-cancer effect, and urotherapy has been offered along with other forms of alternative therapy in some cancer clinics in Mexico. In the Arabian Peninsula, bottled camel urine is sold by vendors, as prophetic medicine with its claimed urine therapy, health benefits. Saudi police arrested a man, \\"because the urine in the bottles was his own\\". Public figures Morarji Desai, Fourth prime minister of India, and an advocate of urine therapy In 1978, the Prime Minister of India, Morarji Desai, a longtime practitioner of urine therapy, spoke to Dan Rather on 60 Minutes about urine therapy. Desai stated that urine therapy was the perfect medical solution for the millions of Indians who cannot afford medical treatment. Cameroon's Health Minister Urbain Olanguena Awono warned people against drinking their own urine, believed in some circles to be a tonic and cure for a number of ailments. \\"Given the risks of toxicity associated with ingesting urine\\", he wrote, \\"the health ministry advises against the consumption of urine and invites those who promote the practice to cease doing so or risk prosecution.\\"Cameroon threatens to jail urine drinkers, Jane Flanagan, Daily Telegraph, on line, article dated March 15, 2003.

This was the greatest military loss by any one American family during World War II. The first ship named for the brothers was the Fletcher-class destroyer , now a museum ship in Buffalo, New York. Construction The contract to build The Sullivans was awarded to Bath Iron Works Corporation in Bath, Maine on 8 April 1992 and her keel was laid down on 27 July 1994. She was launched on 12 August 1995 and sponsored by Kelly Ann Sullivan Loughren, granddaughter of Albert Sullivan. The ship was commissioned on 19 April 1997, with Commander Gerard D. Roncolato in command.\\"A New Navy Destroyer Honors Victims of a Wartime Tragedy at Sea\\", The New York Times.

Upon her commissioning, the ship was given the motto that is thought to have been spoken by the brothers when asked to separate during World War II, \\"We Stick Together.\\" Service USS The Sullivans and other ships launch missiles in December 2003. On 26 April 1997, The Sullivans departed New York City for Norfolk, Virginia, where, after arriving on 27 April, the crew completed underway replenishment qualifications with . The warship then sailed for NS Mayport, Florida, on 29 April and arrived in her new homeport on 2 May. After completing two days of gunnery trials in mid-May, The Sullivans embarked upon her shakedown deployment to the West Indies on 27 May. That cruise took her to the waters off Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where the destroyer conducted numerous sonar, gunnery, and torpedo exercises. The warship also twice entered Roosevelt Roads and stopped once at St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands for port visits. On 29 June, The Sullivans conducted test firings of Standard SM-2 ER missiles from her vertical launch system (VLS). After a brief stop at Mayport for the 4 July weekend, the warship joined other Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, cruisers, destroyers, and frigates off the Virginia Capes for a multiple-ship missile firing exercise. She returned to Mayport on 12 July for upkeep. Following three days of damage control exercises in mid-August, the crew began preparations for a post shakedown availability. She sailed for Maine on 3 September, arriving at Bath Iron Works on 5 September. The shipyard repainted the hull, altered the superstructure, and installed equipment upgrades in the engineering plant and combat systems suite. When the yard work was completed The Sullivans got underway for Mayport, arriving there on 23 November. On 8 December, the destroyer joined the aircraft carrier off Georgia for a week of underway training. While providing plane guard services on 11 December, a T-45 Goshawk trainer splashed following take-off. The Sullivans made a high-speed dash to the site. While the carrier's rescue helicopter safely rescued the pilot, boats launched by The Sullivans picked up considerable pieces of wreckage which were helpful in determining the cause of the crash. The crew also completed helicopter deck landing qualifications before returning to port for the holidays on 12 December. In January 1998, the crew of The Sullivans began a series of exercises designed \\"to build the capability for long-term self-sustained training onboard.\\" They included engineering, combat, seamanship, and battle scenario training exercises. These local operations lasted until 18 May when the warship got underway for New York City and the annual \\"Fleet Week\\" celebrations. Following a week-long port visit, The Sullivans got underway on 26 May for Halifax, Nova Scotia, to conduct training workups for the upcoming Exercise \\"Unified Spirit '98.\\" During the exercise she joined an amphibious task force formed around , two Amphibious transport docks (LPDs), and two dock landing ships (LSDs). The warship screened the \\"gator\\" ships during an exercise focusing on multi-national peace enforcement operations. Ships from Canada, Great Britain, Germany, France, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and Portugal also participated in the exercise. After this exercise, the ship visited Boston, Massachusetts, and then sailed with relatives and family for Mayport, arriving on 1 July. After a summer of conducting midshipmen training off the Florida coast, CDR Roncolato was relieved by CDR E. Scott Hebner, USN, in a change of command ceremony on 4 September 1998. The Sullivans was then assigned to Destroyer Squadron 24, a component of the Battle Group. In 1999 the ship participated in various training exercises to prepare for her maiden deployment in October to the Mediterranean Sea. Later in 2000 she continued into the Arabian Sea, participating in exercises and boarding operations until late March. On 9 February 2000, CDR Daniel Paul Keller USN relieved CDR Heber in a change of command ceremony held at sea on station in the Persian Gulf. After port visits in the Persian Gulf, The Sullivans returned through the Mediterranean Sea to her homeport in April 2000, successfully completing her first six-month deployment. After participating in BEACHFEST at Port Canaveral, Florida, The Sullivans underwent a major maintenance overhaul to prepare for future operations. In 2000 a group affiliated with Al-Qaeda attempted to attack and destroy The Sullivans, but the attackers' boat sank before the attack could be carried out.Wright, Lawrence, The Looming Tower Vintage Books, 2006. pg. 339 While underway and sailing for Composite Unit Training Exercise 01-2 The Sullivans received word of the September 11 attacks. The Sullivans, as part of the Kennedy Battle Group, took part in Operation Noble Eagle. The destroyer provided air-space security along the mid-Atlantic seaboard. In February 2002 The Sullivans deployed with the John F. Kennedy Carrier battle group to the Arabian Sea in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. On 20 March 2010 as the ship entered the harbor at Manama, Bahrain it struck a harbor buoy and sustained between $200,000 and $1 million in damage. The ship's captain, Commander Neil Funtanilla, was subsequently relieved of his command at an admiral's mast by Rear Admiral Phil Davidson, commander of Combined Task Force 50. On 17 August 2011, The Sullivans mistakenly fired on a fishing boat rather than a towed gunnery target during a gunnery exercise off North Carolina. As a result, Commander Mark Olson was relieved of his command. None of the inert shells hit the boat and there were no injuries as a result of the incident. On 7 May 2012, Commander Derick Armstrong was relieved of command after several female crew members alleged that he sexually harassed women aboard ship. On 18 August 2013, The Sullivans provided medical assistance to an ill mariner on board the merchant vessel MV Abir Alqaray No. 4, a Saudi Arabian-flagged dhow, off the coast of Saudi Arabia. On 18 July 2015, a RIM-67 Standard missile test fired from The Sullivans exploded just after launch. No injuries were reported but a small fire occurred on deck. Malfunctions of solid-fuel missiles in the U.S. Navy are extremely rare.Sam LaGrone, 22 July 2015 \\"Destroyer USS The Sullivans Damaged After Missile Explodes After Launch, No Injuries Reported\\", news.usni.org.

On 14 September 2020, it was announced that The Sullivans would be part of HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08) Task Group for the GROUPEX and Joint Warrior Exercises. The Sullivans will continue to escort HMS Queen Elizabeth during its first active deployment in 2021. =Al-Qaeda bombing plot= Members of al-Qaeda attempted an attack on The Sullivans while in port at Aden, Yemen on 3 January 2000 as a part of the 2000 millennium attack plots. The plan was to load a boat full of explosives and detonate it near The Sullivans; however the boat was so overladen that it sank. Later, al-Qaeda tried the same type of attack a second time, successfully bombing on 12 October 2000. (PDF version) Coat of Arms The dark blue and gold, on the shield of the coat of arms, represent the sea and excellence. They are also the Navy's tradition colors. Red is emblematic of courage and sacrifice. The five interlaced swords honor the five Sullivan brothers killed in action during WW II and commemorate their spirit of teamwork and patriotism. The upright points of the swords allude to the present ship's combat readiness and its missile system. The boarder reflects unity and the eleven stars represent the battle stars earned by the first USS THE SULLIVANS; nine for WW II and two for the Korean War. The trident on the crest, symbol of sea prowess, symbolizes DDG 68's modern warfare capabilities; the AEGIS and vertical launch system. The fireball underscores the fierce battle of Guadalcanal where the five brothers courageously fought and died together and highlights its firepower of the past and present USS THE SULLIVANS. The inverted wreath, a traditional symbol of the ultimate sacrifice, is in memory of the Sullivan brothers. The shamrock recalls the Irish heritage. The arms, on the seal, are blazoned in full color upon a white oval enclosed by a dark blue collar edged on the outside with a gold rope and bearing the name \\"USS THE SULLIVANS\\" at the top and \\"DDG 68\\" in the base in gold.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/ddg-68.htm References * External links * *navsource.org: USS The Sullivans *navysite.de: USS The Sullivans *The Sullivan Brothers: History of USS The Sullivans (DDG-68) Arleigh Burke-class destroyers Active destroyers of the United States United States Navy Iowa-related ships Ships built in Bath, Maine 1995 ships Millennium attack plots ","title":"USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)"},{"id":"596488","text":"Charles Dillon Perrine (July 28, 1867 ‚Äì June 21, 1951) was an astronomer at the Lick Observatory in California (1893-1909) who moved to Cordoba, Argentina to accept the position of Director of the Argentine National Observatory (1909-1936). The Cordoba Observatory under Perrine's direction made the first attempts to prove Einstein's theory of relativity by astronomical observation of the deflection of starlight near the Sun during the solar eclipse of October 10, 1912 in Cristina (Brazil), and the solar eclipse of August 21, 1914 at Feodosia, Crimea, Russian Empire. Rain in 1912 and clouds in 1914 prevented results. In 1897 he was awarded the Lalande Prize and gold medal by the Paris Academy of Sciences given each year ‚Ä≥to the person who makes the most outstanding observation ... to further the progress of Astronomy, in France or elsewhere.‚Ä≥. He served as President of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1902, was elected an Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1904, and was awarded the gold medal of the Mexican Astronomical Society in 1905. In the same year he received the degree of Doctor of Sciences (honorary) from Santa Clara College (today Santa Clara University. Charles was born in Steubenville, Ohio, the son of Peter, a Methodist minister, and Elizabeth (McCauley) Perrine.‚ÄòU.S. Passport Application, American Embassy, Paris, France, 27 Oct. 1911‚Äô, ‚ÄúU.S. Passport Applications, 1795-1925‚Äù, Ancestry.com, retrieved May 2020 He was a descendant of Daniel Perrin, \\"The Huguenot\\", and Maria Thorel whose marriage was the first (European) recorded in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, (Feb. 18, 1666). Following high school graduation in 1884, he moved to Alameda, California in about 1886 and worked as a bookkeeper at Armour & Co., a meat-packing business in San Francisco. Interested in photography and astronomy from an early age, and unable to afford a college education, \\"he nevertheless looked forward to engaging in astronomical work\\". Perrine responded to a general invitation to amateurs from E. S. Holden, the Director of the newly established Lick Observatory (1888), to observe the total solar eclipse of Jan. 1, 1889 in Northern California. His report and photographs caught the attention of the Director who hired him as Secretary in 1893. Holden agreed to Perrine's \\"fixed purpose of devoting his spare time to the study of astronomical and related subjects, by way of preparation for later observatory duties\\". As his experience, skills, and discoveries grew he was promoted to Secretary and Assistant Astronomer (1895), Assistant Astronomer (1902), and Astronomer (1905). From 1895-1902 Perrine discovered eight unexpected and four periodic comets including the co- discovery of the lost periodic comet 18D/Perrine-Mrkos in 1896 (see list below). Anton√≠n Mrkos later named the asteroid 6779 Perrine after him. The lunar crater Perrine is also named after him. In 1904-05 he discovered the sixth and seventh moons of Jupiter, today known as Himalia (December 3, 1904) and Elara (Feb 21, 1905) using telescopic photography (glass plate negatives) with the 36-inch Crossley Reflector which he had recently rebuilt. At the time they were simply designated \\"Jupiter VI\\" and \\"Jupiter VII\\" and were given their present names in 1975. The first certain observations of Jupiter's moons (I - IV) were those published by Galileo Galilei in 1610. No additional moons were discovered until E. E. Barnard observed Amalthea (Jupiter V) in 1892. Perrine participated in four solar eclipse expeditions of the Lick Observatory: 1900 (Georgia, USA), 1901 (Sumatra), 1905 (Spain), and 1908 (Flint Island), and was in charge of the one sent to Sumatra. Also in 1901, he and George Ritchey observed the apparent superluminal motion in the nebulosity surrounding Nova Persei 1901. In 1909 he resigned from the Lick Observatory to accept the position of Director of the Argentine National Observatory (today, Observatorio Astron√≥mico de C√≥rdoba) at Cordoba, Argentina from 1909 until his retirement in 1936 at age 69. Perrine played an early role in the history of general relativity. The Argentine National Observatory led by Perrine made the first attempt to test Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity by observing the deflection of star light near the Sun at a total solar eclipse. Perrine wrote, \\"The Cordoba Observatory made the first definite attempt to secure observations at an eclipse (that of 1912) for the relativity problem and that was done at the instigation of Dr. Freundlich.\\" Einstein, in 1905, had proposed his Theory of Special Relativity which predicted that gravity bent light. In 1911 Einstein wrote, \\"It would be urgently wished that astronomers take up the question here raised (gravitational light deflection near the Sun),...\\". Dr. Erwin Finlay-Freundlich, a German astronomer and mathematician, took up Einstein's challenge and contacted Perrine in 1911 and 1912 to ask if he would undertake a test of light deflection near the Sun. Perrine agreed to add the test to his planned expedition to Cristina, Brazil to observe the total solar eclipse of Oct. 10, 1912. William Wallace Campbell, the Director of the Lick Observatory, also encouraged Perrine to pursue the test and loaned him Lick's eclipse camera lenses. The Argentine National Observatory built the telescopes and readied the equipment at the observation site at Cristina, Brazil. Unfortunately, steady rain made visibility and therefore the test impossible. As Perrine put it, \\"We suffered a total eclipse instead of observing one\\". While observational results were elusive in 1912, the expedition produced valuable instruments (telescopes, cameras, timers, etc.) and experience for the next eclipse in 1914 in Russia. Three observatories would organize expeditions and include light deflection in their programs for 1914; the Argentine National Observatory (Perrine), the Lick Observatory (Campbell), and the Berlin-Babelsberg Observatory (Freundlich). Perrine's photograph of the total solar eclipse of August 21, 1914 was the first taken in an attempt to measure star light deflection near the Sun which effect was predicted by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity in 1911. Thin clouds obscured the eclipse just enough to prevent accurate star observation. If these first attempts in Brazil in 1912 or Russia in 1914 had achieved results, they would have proven Einstein wrong because at that time (1911-1914) Einstein had predicted a light deflection of 0.87 arcseconds rather than the 1.75 arcseconds which he later calculated in 1915 with the General Theory of Relativity. Perrine pioneered the study of astrophysics in Argentina and promoted the construction of the 60-inch/1.54 m reflecting telescope at Bosque Alegre which was completed in 1942 after his retirement in 1936. It would remain the largest telescope in South America until 1981 when Brazil built a 63-inch reflector. After retirement he lived in Cordoba then in Villa General Mitre (originally and again Villa del Totoral) where he died. He is buried in the Cemetery del Salvador (Cementerio del Salvador) formerly called the Cementerio de Disidentes (cemetery of dissidents/non-catholics), in the city of C√≥rdoba. His life was divided almost equally between the United States and Argentina (appx. 42 years in each).

His works include Generalization in Ethics ‚Äì An Essay in the Logic of Ethics, with the Rudiments of a System of Moral Philosophy (1961). Personal life Marcus George Singer was born in 1926 in New York City. His father, David Singer, a lawyer, died when MGS was 9 years old from a rare autoimmune disease. His mother, Esther Kobre Singer, was a concert level pianist and received awards from the City of New York for her service typing books in braille. Her father and uncle, through their small bank, provided loans to many Jews to pay passage to the USA (Kobre Bank, NYC). MGS enlisted in the US Army Air Corps Reserves in 1943. From 1944 to 1945 he served in the U.S. Army Air Force as an aerial engineer and was training as a pilot. After mustering out of the army, he attended the University of Illinois, met his future wife, Blanche Ladenson, and graduated with High Honors in Philosophy, Phi Beta Kappa in 1948. In 1952, Singer earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy at Cornell University. Immediately on receiving his doctorate, Singer accepted a position teaching in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he continued to teach until 1994.Timmons (2001), p. 1584. Marcus lived with his wife, Blanche Ladenson Singer, for almost 70 years. He died February 21, 2016 after battling chronic illness, likely autoimmune. His curiosity, humor, enthusiasm for life and the larger issues of living continued almost until the end of life. Marcus has two daughters, Karen and Debra, and one grand child, Isaac. Karen Singer is Principal and Artistic Director of Karen Singer Tileworks. Debra Singer is a photographer/designer focused on environmental advocacy, also working at UCSF Medical Center in research program administration. One of his closest friends was Claudia Card, Emma Goldman Professor of Philosophy, UW‚ÄìMadison, whom he mentored since her undergraduate years at UW. She pre-deceased him by six months. His brilliance manifested at a young age, with insatiable curiosity, quick wittedness, an interest in right and wrong. He served in the US Army Airforce to fight fascism in WW II - the war ended before he was sent to a front, but living through that time of evil profoundly influenced his thinking and actions. His family lost family in Germany and throughout Europe. His brother-in-law Lawrence Cane served in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, fighting against Franco in Spain and was blacklisted as a Communist thinker (See 'Fighting Fascism in Spain: The World War II Letters of An American Veteran of the Spanish Civil War.' MG Singer persisted in focusing on moral philosophy and ethics despite it being out of fashion in philosophical circles. In later years, he explained what he did as 'teaching people how to think for themselves', one of the most important endeavors one can do. MG Singer served as Chairman of the UW Philosophy Department 1963‚Äì1968, during the Vietnam War Years. He served as the president of the American Philosophical Association, Central Division, from 1985 until 1986. He gave generously to support civil liberties, free thought, environmental and social justice, wildlife protection, indigenous peoples' rights, the right to clean air, water, soil, food for all, among other issues. He taught that to keep silent in the face of evil, especially that perpetrated by the culture around one, is to be complicit in that evil. His latest works focused on Evil, and a History of the UW Philosophy Department (to be published in the next year.) Works Singer's early work describes a moral philosophy which has become known as the generalization argument. He further refines this philosophy in later works. Similar to Immanuel Kant's universalizability principle, Singer argues that if it is acceptable for one person in a particular situation to take ‚Äì or not take ‚Äì an action, then it is acceptable for any person in that particular situation to do the same.Timmons (2001), p. 1585. He further posits that an action is ethical if the results would be positive if everyone took that action and the results would not be negative if no one took that action. According to Richard Flathman, Singer's 1961 book, Generalization in Ethics ‚Äì An Essay in the Logic of Ethics, with the Rudiments of a System of Moral Philosophy, was, at its publication, the \\"most detailed study of the topic\\" of generalization of the universalizability principle.Flathman (1967), p. 39. According to his profile in the Encyclopedia of Ethics, Singer's \\"writings also include important work on the moral philosophies of\\" John Stuart Mill and Henry Sidgwick. Singer's views of utilitarianism have also been noted as some of the most influential of modern ethicists.Ross (1994), p. 35. His latest work as Emeritus Professor focused on Evil in the world.

She is a United States Navy ship named in honor of the five Sullivan brothers (George, Francis, Joseph, Madison, and Albert) aged 20 to 27 who lost their lives when their ship, , was sunk by a Japanese submarine during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942. This was the greatest military loss by any one American family during World War II. She was also the first ship commissioned in the Navy that honored more than one person. After service in both World War II and the Korean War, The Sullivans was assigned to the 6th Fleet and was a training ship until she was decommissioned on 7 January 1965. In 1977, she and cruiser were processed for donation to the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park in Buffalo, New York. The ship now serves as a memorial and is open for public tours. Construction The Sullivan brothers on board the . From left to right: Joseph, Francis, Albert, Madison, and George Sullivan. The Sullivans was originally laid down as Putnam on 10 October 1942, at San Francisco by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation. She was initially renamed Sullivan until President Franklin Roosevelt changed the name to The Sullivans to clarify that the name honored all five Sullivan brothers.Persico, Joseph E. Roosevelt's Centurions. , page 273 The name was made official on 6 February 1943, and launched 4 April 1943. The ship was sponsored by Mrs. Thomas F. Sullivan, the mother of the five Sullivan brothers. The Sullivans was commissioned on 30 September 1943, with Commander Kenneth M. Gentry in command. World War II service =1944= Following a shakedown cruise, The Sullivans got underway with sister ships and on 23 December 1943. The group arrived at Pearl Harbor five days later. During training operations in Hawaiian waters, the ship was assigned to Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 52\\\\. On 16 January 1944, she steamed out of Pearl Harbor with Task Group 58.2 (TG 58.2) bound for the Marshall Islands. En route to Kwajalein Atoll the group was joined by Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9). Two days later, as the American warships neared their target, picket destroyers were sent ahead to protect the main force from the enemy. On 24 January, TG 58.2 arrived at the dawn launching point for air strikes against Roi. For two days, The Sullivans screened , , and as they launched nearly continuous aerial raids. Thereafter, the destroyer continued her operations to the north and northwest of Roi and Namur Islands throughout the Battle of Kwajalein until 4 February, when TG 58.2 retired to Majuro to refuel and replenish. Underway at noon on the 12th, The Sullivans screened (protected) the sortie of Task Group 58.2, as part of Task Force 58's raid on Truk. The same carriers ‚Äî Essex, Intrepid, and Cabot ‚Äî whose planes had attacked Roi and Namur steamed in the van now headed for the Japanese fortress-base in the Central Pacific. From the time the group arrived at its launching point on 16 February, the carriers launched what seemed to be nearly continuous air strikes against Truk. \\"No enemy opposition of any kind was encountered,\\" wrote The Sullivans commander, \\"indicating that the initial attacks came as a complete surprise.\\" While the enemy may have been slow to react at the outset, they soon struck back ‚Äì torpedoing Intrepid at 00:10 on the 17th. The carrier slowed to and lost steering control. The Sullivans, , and stood by the stricken carrier and escorted her to Majuro for repairs. Reaching Majuro on 21 February, the destroyer soon sailed on to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 4 March for drydocking and upkeep. Underway again on the 22nd, The Sullivans covered the sortie of Task Groups 58.2, 58.9, and 50.15 from Majuro, bound for the Palaus, Yap, and Woleai Islands. On the evening of the 29th, while the American warships were approaching the target area, enemy aircraft attacked but were driven off by the anti-aircraft fire from the ships. The next day, The Sullivans screened the carriers during air strikes and that evening helped to beat off a Japanese air attack. After returning to Majuro for replenishment, the warship screened TG 58.2 during air strikes on Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), Tanahmerah, Wakde, and Aitape to support amphibious operations on New Guinea. Late in April, The Sullivans participated in support of air strikes on the Japanese base at Truk. On the 29th during one of these raids, the Japanese retaliated with a low- level air attack. American radar picked up four Japanese planes away, coming in fast at altitudes varying from 10 to . When the planes came within range, The Sullivans opened up with one 40-millimeter twin mount and all five guns. Two aircraft splashed into the sea due to the firing of the American ships, and one crossing ahead of The Sullivans was taken under fire and crashed in flames off her port beam. The Sullivans off Ponape, 2 May 1944 The Sullivans arrived off the northwest coast of Ponape on the afternoon of 1 May and provided cover for the battleships led by which bombarded the island. From the disengaged side of the screen, The Sullivans fired 18 rounds from extreme range at Tumu Point. She then noted three beached Japanese landing barges and shifted her fire to them. However, she received the general cease-fire order shortly thereafter. During the task unit's retirement, The Sullivans refueled from and arrived at Majuro on 4 May. Ten days later, TG 58.2 sortied again, bound for Marcus and Wake Islands. Launching the first raid at 08:00 on the 19th, the American carriers kept up nearly continuous air strikes with no enemy interruptions for three days. En route back to Majuro, The Sullivans and her sister destroyers conducted a thorough but unsuccessful search for a suspected submarine. On 6 June, The Sullivans got underway again, bound for Saipan, Tinian, and Guam to screen carriers in conducting air strikes. On occasion while in the screen, The Sullivans' radar picked up enemy \\"snoopers\\" around the periphery of the formation ‚Äì and before dawn at 03:15 on the 12th, TG 58.2 shot down one in flames. The second day's strikes against Saipan took place on the 13th to support the American landings there. Assigned to the duty of communication-linking station between task forces, The Sullivans remained within visual sighting distance of both TG's 58.1 and 58.2 during the day. That day, she picked up 31 Japanese merchant seamen after their ship had been sunk offshore and transferred these prisoners to flagship . On 19 June 1944, during the first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, Japanese aircraft attacked the task group. The Sullivans picked up a plane visually at a range of less than five miles (8 km). \\"Judies,\\" diving from , pressed home their attacks. One, taken under fire by The Sullivans, took tracer fire from the ship's 20- and 40-millimeter batteries and, moments later, crashed just short of the horizon. American air attacks against Pagan Island, made without enemy retaliation, topped off the Saipan-Tinian-Guam strikes; and The Sullivans proceeded with TG 58.2 to Eniwetok for upkeep. Underway on 30 June, The Sullivans resumed work in the screen of carriers launching air strikes to support operations against Saipan and Tinian. During this action, The Sullivans served as fighter-direction ship for TU 58.2.4. On Independence Day, The Sullivans joined Bombardment Unit One (TU 58.2.4) to conduct a shore bombardment of airfields, shore batteries, and other installations on the west coast of Iwo Jima. The heavy ships in the group opened fire at 15:00, and smoke and dust soon obscured targets along the western shore of the island, making spotting difficult. The Sullivans, second ship in a column of destroyers, opened fire at 15:48 on planes parked on the southern airstrip. After three ranging salvos, the ship commenced hitting twin-engined \\"Bettys\\" parked in revetments along the strip. Five planes blew up, and eight other planes were probably damaged by shrapnel and burning gasoline. Minutes later, an enemy ship resembling an LST came under The Sullivans gunfire and caught fire astern. While closed to complete the destruction of the enemy vessel, The Sullivans and the remainder of the bombardment unit retired and rejoined TG 58.2. From 7 to 22 July, TG 58.2 operated south and west of the Marianas, conducting daily air strikes on Guam and Rota Islands before returning to Garapan Anchorage, Saipan, to allow the carriers to replenish bombs. Underway at dawn on the 23d, The Sullivans accompanied the task group as it sped towards the Palaus for air strikes on the 26th and 27th. She joined TG 58.4 for temporary duty on 30 July and continued air strikes until 6 August, when she joined TG 58.7, the heavy bombardment group, and operated with TP 34 until 11 August, when the group returned to Eniwetok for replenishment. Early in September, as the Navy prepared to take the Palaus, The Sullivans supported neutralizing air strikes against Japanese air bases in the Philippines. At dawn on the 7th, she began radar picket duty for TG 38.2 and continued the task through the strikes of the 9th and 10th. From 18:00 on 12 September, the ships noted an increase in air activity ‚Äì observing many bogies that merely orbited the formations as snoopers. The carriers conducted further raids on the central Philippines on the 13th and 14th and then shifted course to the north to subject Manila to air attacks commencing on the 21st. Three days later, American planes again hit the central Philippines. Returning to Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, at dawn on the 28th, The Sullivans went alongside for ammunition, provisions, and routine upkeep. However, the cross-swells in the anchorage swept The Sullivans hard against the battleship's steel hide, damaging the destroyer's hull and superstructure. Following brief antisubmarine patrol duty, she proceeded to Ulithi on 1 October. While undergoing tender repairs alongside , The Sullivans formed part of a nest of destroyers blown away from the tender during a heavy storm that lashed the anchorage. The Sullivans drifted free downwind and got up steam 'in a hurry'. However, she collided with . Many small boats were being tossed about, and The Sullivans rescued four men from 's gig before it disappeared beneath the waves. As the storm abated on the 4th, the warship returned to Ulithi to complete the abbreviated tender overhaul alongside Dixie. At 16:15 on 6 October, The Sullivans sortied with the carriers and protected them during raids against targets on Formosa and the Ryukyus. On the evening of the 12th, as the planes returned to the carriers, radar spotted the first of many Japanese aircraft coming down from the north. For the next six hours, approximately 50 to 60 Japanese aircraft subjected the American task force to continuous air attacks. Nearly 45 minutes after sunset, The Sullivans sighted a \\"Betty,\\" coming in low on the starboard side, and took it under fire. During the next 15 minutes, the formation to which The Sullivans was attached shot down three planes; between 18:56 and 19:54, the destroyer herself took five planes under fire. Varying speed between 18 and , the formation undertook eight emergency maneuvers. Again and again, timely turns and the great volume of gunfire thrown up by the ships repulsed the enemy air attacks. The second phase of the attack began at 21:05 on the 12th and continued through 02:35 on the 13th. The Japanese increased the use of \\"window\\" to jam American radar transmissions while their flares lit up the evening with ghostly light. The formation made smoke whenever enemy flare-dropping planes approached, creating an eerie haze effect which helped baffle the enemy pilots. Meanwhile, The Sullivans and the other ships in formation executed 38 simultaneous turn movements at speeds between 22 and as their guns kept up a steady fire to repel the attackers. The next day, the carriers again launched successful strikes on Formosa. During the ensuing night retirement, the formation again came under attack by Japanese torpedo-carrying \\"Betties\\" which struck home this time and damaged . The Sullivans then helped to protect the damaged cruiser. On the 14th, \\"Betty\\" torpedo bombers scored against .The Sullivans soon joined the screen which guarded the two battle-battered cruisers ‚Äì nicknamed \\"CripDiv 1\\" ‚Äî as they retired toward Ulithi. Things progressed well until the 16th, when the Japanese mounted a heavy air attack to attempt to finish off cruisers. Houston reeled under the impact of a second hit astern, and The Sullivans opened fire on the \\"Frances\\" which had made the attack and splashed the Japanese plane. The Sullivans and then took a second \\"Frances\\" under fire and knocked it down off the bow of . The Sullivans rescued 118 Houston men and kept them on board until the 18th, when she transferred them to . While the damaged cruisers were making their way to Ulithi, a Japanese surface force attempted to close the formation before TF 38 intervened to drive them back. The Sullivans transferred salvage gear to Houston and helped with the ship's many wounded. For his part in directing the destroyer's rescue and salvage attempts, Comdr. Ralph J. Baum received his first Silver Star. On 20 October, The Sullivans joined TG 38.2 for scheduled air strikes on the central Philippines in support of the Leyte landings. At dawn of the 24th, reconnaissance located a Japanese surface force south of Mindoro, and the American carriers launched air strikes all day against the enemy warships. That morning, a Japanese air attack developed, and The Sullivans downed an \\"Oscar\\" fighter plane. By 25 October, enemy forces were sighted coming down from the north; TF 34, including The Sullivans, was formed and headed north, following the carrier groups in TF 38\\\\. At dawn on the 25th, the carriers launched air strikes to harass the Japanese surface units, now some north. At 11:00, TF 34 reversed course, topped-off the destroyers with fuel, and formed fast striking group TG 34.5, with Iowa, , three light cruisers, The Sullivans, and seven other destroyers. The American force missed the Japanese by three hours, but ran across a straggler and reported sinking an . Japanese records fail to confirm the claim. After sweeping south along the coast of Samar hunting for enemy \\"cripples,\\" The Sullivans and other units of TG 34.5 reported back to TG 38.2. The destroyer then remained in the Philippine area, screening the fast carriers and standing by on plane guard duties, through mid-November. At dusk on the 19th, during one of the many air attacks fought off by The Sullivans, the destroyer damaged a \\"Betty\\" by gunfire and watched it disappear over the horizon, smoking but stubbornly remaining airborne. Six days later, she had better luck when her guns set a Japanese plane afire and splashed it into the sea. Two days later, her task group returned to Ulithi. The destroyer undertook training exercises from 8 to 11 December before rejoining TG 38.2 to screen its warships during air strikes on Manila and southern Luzon beginning on 14 December. On the 17th, running low on fuel, The Sullivans commenced refueling but, with the weather worsening minute by minute, she broke off the operation. Typhoon Cobra swept through the Fleet, with the wind clocked at an estimated on the morning of 18 December. Three destroyers were sunk and several ships damaged by the winds and waves. The Sullivans, her \\"lucky shamrock\\" painted on her funnel, emerged from the typhoon undamaged and, on the 20th began searching for men lost overboard from other ships. The lingering bad weather resulted in cancellation of air strikes, and The Sullivans retired to Ulithi on Christmas Eve. =1945= After a brief run to Manus and back, escorting Iowa, The Sullivans sortied from Ulithi on 30 December to screen TG 38.2's air strikes on Formosa in support of the American landings on Luzon. Heavy seas forced a three-day postponement of a high-speed thrust toward the target originally planned for the night of 6 January 1945. During the evening of the 9th, the task force passed through the Bashi Channel and entered the South China Sea. Three days later, carrier planes from TG 38.2 swept over Saigon and Camranh Bay, Indochina, hammering at whatever enemy merchantmen they found. Soon after the conclusion of the air strikes, a bombardment group, TG 34.5, was formed to go after possible \\"cripples\\" and dispatch them by surface gunfire. Accordingly, two battleships, two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and 15 destroyers raced into Camranh Bay but found it devoid of Japanese shipping. Throughout the day, however, carrier pilots had better luck and enjoyed a veritable \\"field day\\" with coastal marus. During subsequent air strikes on Hainan Island, Hong Kong, and Formosa, The Sullivans served on radar picket duty ahead of the task group. A brief respite for upkeep at Ulithi in late January preceded the ship's deployment with TG 58.2, covering the carriers as they launched devastating air strikes against the Japanese homeland itself, hitting Tokyo and other targets on Honsh≈´ on 16 and 17 February. From the 18th through the 21st, American carrier-based air power struck at Japanese positions contesting the landings on Iwo Jima. More strikes were scheduled for Tokyo four days later, but bad weather forced their cancellation. Retiring from the area, TF 58 fueled and commenced a high-speed run at Okinawa at noon on 28 February. Later that day, The Sullivans sighted and destroyed a drifting mine. At dawn on 1 March, Hellcats, Avengers, Dauntlesses, and Helldivers attacked Japanese positions on Okinawa. The ships of the task force encountered no enemy opposition from sea or sky and soon retired towards Ulithi. The Sullivans sortied 12 days later, bound for Kyushu and southern Honsh≈´ to support the invasion of Okinawa. Once again screening for TG 58.2, The Sullivans stood by as the carriers launched air strikes on 14 March. On 20 March, The Sullivans fueled from at 11:52, clearing the carrier's side five minutes later when a kamikaze alert sent the ships scurrying. At 14:39, The Sullivans commenced maneuvering to go alongside Enterprise again ‚Äì this time to pick up a part for her FD radar antenna. Soon, however, another enemy air attack scattered the ships. As a line had not yet been thrown across to the carrier, The Sullivans bent on speed and cleared her as other ships in the task group opened fire on the attackers. A Japanese plane came through the antiaircraft fire and crashed into astern as that destroyer was fueling alongside . The stricken destroyer lost steering control and started to veer across the big carrier's bow, and only rapid and radical maneuvering on Hancocks part averted a collision. The Sullivans soon closed Halsey Powell to render emergency assistance. She slowed to a stop 11 minutes later and lowered her motor whaleboat to transfer her medical officer and a pharmacist's mate to Halsey Powell, when another kamikaze came out of the skies, apparently bent on crashing into The Sullivans. At 16:10, the destroyer's radar picked up the \\"Zeke\\" on its approach; and, as soon as the motor whaler was clear of the water, The Sullivans leapt ahead with all engines thrusting at flank speed. Bringing right full rudder, The Sullivans maneuvered radically while her 20- and 40-millimeter guns sent streams of shells at the \\"Zeke,\\" which passed over the masthead and escaped. Meanwhile, Halsey Powell managed to achieve a steady course at five knots; and, with The Sullivans, she retired toward Ulithi. However, their troubles were not yet over. At 10:46 on the following day, 21 March, The Sullivans picked up a plane, closing from . Visually identified as a twin-engined \\"Frances,\\" the aircraft was taken under fire at by The Sullivans' 5 inch battery. Halsey Powell joined in too; and, within a few moments, the \\"Frances\\" crashed into the sea about abeam of The Sullivans. At 12:50, a combat air patrol (CAP) Hellcat from Yorktown, under direction by Halsey Powell, splashed another \\"Frances.\\" At 13:20, a CAP Hellcat from Intrepid, directed by The Sullivans, downed a \\"Nick\\" or \\"Dinah.\\" On 25 March, The Sullivans and Halsey Powell arrived at Ulithi, the former for upkeep prior to training exercises and the latter for battle repairs. The warship next rendezvoused with TF 58 off Okinawa and guarded the carriers supporting the landings on the island. While operating on radar picket duty on the 15th, the ship came under enemy air attack, but downed one plane and emerged unscathed. She continued conducting radar picket patrols for the task group, ranging some 12 to out from the main body of the force. On the afternoon of 29 April, she commenced fueling from , but a kamikaze alert interrupted the replenishment, forcing The Sullivans to break away from the carrier's side. During the ensuing action, and were both crashed by suiciders but survived. taking casualties on board from on 12 May 1945, one day after the carrier was devastated by a kamikaze attack. The Sullivans is in the foreground. Kamikazes continued to plague the ships of TG 58.3 as they supported the troops fighting ashore on Okinawa. Everything from landing craft to battleships were targeted. On the morning of 11 May, a kamikaze crashed into Bunker Hill. The Sullivans promptly closed the carrier to render assistance and picked up 166 men forced over the side by the fires that at one point ravaged the ship. After transferring them to ships in TG 50.8 and replenishing her fuel bunkers, she helped to screen TG 58.3 during air strikes on Kyushu. In a morning air attack three days later, Enterprise was hit by a kamikaze. Four enemy planes were shot down in the melee ‚Äì one by The Sullivans in what proved to be her last combat action during World War II. The Sullivans anchored at San Pedro Bay, Leyte Gulf, on 1 June for recreation and upkeep. She departed Leyte on the 20th, bound, via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, for the west coast. The destroyer arrived at Mare Island, Calif., on 9 July and, two days later, commenced her overhaul. She thus missed the final fleet activity that closed the war. Meanwhile, since the return of peace greatly reduced the Navy's need for warships, The Sullivans was decommissioned at San Diego on 10 January 1946 ‚Äì soon after her overhaul was completed ‚Äì and she was placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Korean War service The Sullivans remained decommissioned at San Diego until May 1951, when she began to undergo reactivation. This was due to naval fleet expansion because of the Korean War. She was recommissioned on 6 July 1951 with Commander Ira M. King in command. The Sullivans soon headed to her home port in Newport, R.I. by way of the Panama Canal. During the winter of 1951‚Äì52, the ship conducted training exercises off the east coast and in the Caribbean. The Sullivans departed Newport on 6 September 1952 bound for Japan. Proceeding via the Panama Canal, San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Midway she arrived at Sasebo, Japan on 10 October 1952. The next day she got underway to join Task Force 77 off the eastern shores of Korea. Her duties included screening the fast carriers which were launching repeated air strikes to interdict enemy supply lines. She also supported United Nations ground forces who were battling communist forces. The Sullivans remained on this duty until 20 October 1952 when she steamed to Yokosuka, Japan for a brief refit. The Sullivans alongside , December 1952 Following the refit, The Sullivans stopped at Buckner Bay, Okinawa and then proceeded to rejoin Task Force 77. Upon her arrival on 16 November 1952 she resumed screening activities and plane guard duty. She supported the carriers as they made the northernmost stab at North Korean supply lines, approaching within of the Soviet base at Vladivostok, Russia. MiG-15 fighters approached the task force, but combat air patrol Grumman F9F Panthers downed two of the attackers and damaged a third in history's first engagement between jet fighters over water. The destroyer arrived back at Sasebo, Japan on 5 December 1952. From Sasebo she joined United Nations forces on 14 December 1952 in blockading the Korean coasts. Her mission was to interdict seaborne traffic and bombard shore targets to support United Nations ground troops and interdict enemy supply operations. Arriving in Area \\"G\\" the following day, The Sullivans made contact with the enemy on the 16th off Songjin, North Korea which was an important rail terminus and supply center. For the next few days, she bombarded railroad trains and tunnels. She frequently opened fire to destroy railroad rolling stock, depots and prevented repairs to railroad tracks and buildings. On Christmas Day 1952, The Sullivans scored direct hits on a railroad bridge while under fire from enemy artillery positions on shore. Fifty rounds from enemy guns failed to touch the ship, although near-misses showered the warship's decks with shell fragments. Counter-battery fire from the ship destroyed at least one of the enemy artillery positions. The Sullivans was ordered home and departed Yokosuka, Japan on 26 January 1953. On the voyage home the ship called at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, Hong Kong, Subic Bay, Singapore, Colombo, Ceylon, Bombay, India, Bahrein and Aden. The Sullivans then steamed through the Red Sea, transited the Suez Canal, and proceeded to Cannes, France via Naples. After a brief fueling stop at Gibraltar the warship reached Newport, R.I. on 11 April 1953. 6th Fleet deployment The Sullivans off Newport, Rhode Island, 29 October 1962. The destroyer operated out of her home port well into the summer of 1953, before deploying to the Mediterranean for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. She remained on this duty through the end of the year and returned to Newport on 3 February 1954 for operations off the east coast and into the Caribbean through May 1955. She again deployed to European and Mediterranean waters from May to August of that year before returning to Newport late in the summer. In the years that followed, The Sullivans continued alternating east coast operations with Mediterranean deployments. The summer of 1958 saw a communist threat to the security of Lebanon, and president Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered American ships to land troops there to protect Americans and to help stabilize the tense situation. The Sullivans supported the landings of Marines at Beirut. After their presence had dispelled the crisis, she returned to the United States for a three-month navy yard overhaul and subsequent refresher training at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Back at Newport in March 1959, The Sullivans joined a hunter/killer group formed around the aircraft carrier . Then, after making a midshipman training cruise for USNA and NROTC midshipmen in which she also conducted antisubmarine warfare operations, the destroyer sailed for another Mediterranean deployment which lasted until she returned home in the autumn. Operations out of Newport occupied The Sullivans until early spring of 1960 when she headed south for ASROC evaluations off Key West, Florida. During this deployment to southern climes, on March 31 and April 1, the warship helped to rescue five of eleven survivors from a U.S. Air Force KC-97 Stratofreighter(Model F Stratotanker) that had ditched 40 miles off the Florida coast near Cape Canaveral. Following NATO exercises in September, The Sullivans visited Lisbon, Portugal, prior to a quick trip through the Mediterranean, Suez Canal, and Red Sea, to Karachi, West Pakistan. In late October and into November, she participated in Operation \\"Midlink III,\\" joint operations with Pakistani, Iranian, and British warships. After returning to the Mediterranean, The Sullivans conducted exercises with the French Navy and with the 6th Fleet and reached home in time for Christmas. In January 1961, The Sullivans assisted in the sea trials of the nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarine off Portsmouth, New Hampshire, before steaming south and taking part in Operation Springboard. While in the Caribbean, she visited Martinique. Briefly back at Newport early in March, The Sullivans soon returned to the West Indies to support marine landing exercises at Vieques, Puerto Rico. In April, the ship began intensive training in the waters off Florida to prepare to cover a Project Mercury spaceshot. The Sullivans joined Lake Champlain at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and took station. On 5 May 1961, Commander Alan Shepard's Mercury space capsule, Freedom 7, passed overhead and splashed down near Lake Champlain and was speedily rescued by helicopters from the carrier. The Sullivans then made a midshipman cruise in June, visiting New York and Halifax, Nova Scotia. From September 1961 to February 1962, The Sullivans underwent a major overhaul in the Boston Naval Shipyard. She proceeded to Guantanamo Bay soon thereafter to train for duty as a school ship. She subsequently served as a model destroyer in which officer students could see and learn the fundamentals of destroyer operation. In May and again in August, The Sullivans made training cruises to the Caribbean for the Destroyer School. In October 1962, after Soviet missiles were discovered in Cuba, The Sullivans joined American naval forces blockading the island during negotiations with the Soviet Union over the issue. When the Soviet Government withdrew the strategic weapons, the destroyer returned to Newport. On 7 January 1963, The Sullivans got underway from Newport bound for the Caribbean and another training cruise. Following her return to Newport, she conducted local operations for the Destroyer School. The tragic loss of nuclear submarine off Boston on 10 April 1963 caused the destroyer to support emergency investigations of the disaster. For the remainder of 1963 and into the first few months of 1964, The Sullivans continued to train officer students. On 1 April 1964, the destroyer was transferred to the Naval Reserve Force, and her homeport was changed to New York City. Departing Newport on 13 April, the warship proceeded to New York and took on her selected reserve crew. Her cruises with the reserves embarked were devoted mostly to ASW exercises and took the ship to Canadian ports such as Halifax, Nova Scotia; Saint John, New Brunswick; and Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, in the north to Palm Beach, Florida, in the south. After the collision of the Australian aircraft carrier and destroyer , which resulted in the sinking of Voyager on 10 February 1964, the United States offered The Sullivans to Australia along with sister ship as a temporary replacement. The Royal Australian Navy instead accepted the British Royal Navy's offer of the Daring- class destroyer , which was of the same class as Voyager. Museum ship The Sullivans with and The Sullivans received nine battle stars for World War II service and two for Korean service. On 7 January 1965, The Sullivans was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and she remained in reserve into the 1970s. In 1977, she and cruiser were processed for donation to the Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park in Buffalo, New York. The ship now serves as a memorial and is open for public tours. The ship was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

The town has a population of about 32,000 during the winter, but can swell to 100,000 inhabitants during summer, being among the main towns attracting tourists in Apulia. It also has a British and German immigrant community and an industrial zone. The region is a producer of high quality olive oil and wine.  History  Saint Orontius' column The region around Ostuni has been inhabited since the Stone Age. The town is reputed to have been originally established by the Messapii, a pre- classic tribe, and destroyed by Hannibal during the Punic Wars. It was then re-built by the Greeks, the name Ostuni deriving from the Greek Astu n√©on (\\"new town\\"). Sacked after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, in 996 AD the town became part of the Norman County of Lecce .The Normans built their medieval town around the summit of the hill (229 m), with a castle (only remains can be seen) and city walls with four gates. From 1300 to 1463 it was part of the Principality of Taranto and from 1507 (together with what is now the frazione of Villanova and Grottaglie) passed to Isabella, Duchess of Bari, wife of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan. Under Isabella's rule, Ostuni thrived during the Italian Renaissance. Isabella protected humanists and people of art and letters, including bishop Giovanni Bovio. She died in 1524 and Ostuni passed as a dowry to her daughter Bona Sforza, wife-to-be of Sigismund I of Poland, King of Poland. During Bona Sforza's government, Ostuni continued to enjoy a stable rule. In 1539 she had towers built along all the shoreline as protection against anticipated attacks from Turks who controlled the Balkans. These towers (still extant, including Pozzella Tower, the Pylon, Villanova and others), were garrisoned and communicated using fiery beacons.  Main sights  Cathedral. The \\"Old Town\\" is Ostuni's citadel built on top of a hill and still fortified by the ancient walls. Ostuni is commonly referred to as \\"the White Town\\" (La Citt√† Bianca in Italian) for its white walls and its typically white-painted architecture. Monuments in their own right, the town's largest buildings are the Ostuni Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace, together with a number of palazzi of local aristocratic families: Aurisicchio, Ayroldi, Bisantizzi, Falghieri, Ghionda, Giovine, Jurleo, Marseglia, Moro, Palmieri, Petrarolo, Siccoda, Urselli and Zaccaria. In the surrounding countryside there are typical Pugliese \\"masserie\\", fortified large estate-farms, one of which, San Domenico, was once held by the Knights of Malta.  Tourism  View of Ostuni Ostuni is the fifth city in Italy by percentage of British residents and the first for sale of houses and villas. Starting from 2010, Ostuni and its nearest towns were characterized by so many arrivals from foreign countries, that some local and national newspapers coined a new term, \\"salentoshire\\" to describe this phenomenon, taking the term from the useful \\"chiantishire\\", taken for the similar phenomena that has characterized Tuscany some years ago.

The fat tree network is a universal network for provably efficient communication. It was invented by Charles E. Leiserson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985. In a tree data structure, every branch has the same thickness, regardless of their place in the hierarchy‚Äîthey are all \\"skinny\\" (skinny in this context means low-bandwidth). In a fat tree, branches nearer the top of the hierarchy are \\"fatter\\" (thicker) than branches further down the hierarchy. In a telecommunications network, the branches are data links; the varied thickness (bandwidth) of the data links allows for more efficient and technology-specific use. Mesh and hypercube topologies have communication requirements that follow a rigid algorithm, and cannot be tailored to specific packaging technologies. Applications in supercomputers Supercomputers that use a fat tree network include the two fastest as of late 2018, Summit and Sierra, as well as Tianhe-2, the Meiko Scientific CS-2, Yellowstone, the Earth Simulator, the Cray X2, the Connection Machine CM-5, and various Altix supercomputers. Mercury Computer Systems applied a variant of the fat tree topology‚Äîthe hypertree network‚Äîto their multicomputers. In this architecture, 2 to 360 compute nodes are arranged in a circuit-switched fat tree network. Each node has local memory that can be mapped by any other node. Each node in this heterogeneous system could be an Intel i860, a PowerPC, or a group of three SHARC digital signal processors. The fat tree network was particularly well suited to Fast Fourier transform computations, which customers used for such signal processing tasks as radar, sonar, and medical imaging. Related topologies In August 2008, a team of computer scientists at UCSD published a scalable design for network architecture that uses a topology inspired by the fat tree topology to realize networks that scale better than those of previous hierarchical networks. The architecture uses commodity switches that are cheaper and more power-efficient than high-end modular data center switches. This topology is actually a special instance of a Clos network, rather than a fat-tree as described above. That is because the edges near the root are emulated by many links to separate parents instead of a single high-capacity link to a single parent. However, many authors continue to use the term in this way.  References  Further reading * Network topology ","title":"Fat tree"},{"id":"596506","text":"Space opera is a subgenre of science fiction.

It was released on June 19, 2001 in two forms, a single disc and a double disc release. It was the second release through the band's own label, Widespread Records, in conjunction with UK-based label Sanctuary Records. The album covered a wide variety of styles, from rock to Latin and grunge to soul, yet did not depart from this jam band's signature sound. Randall Bramblett, a solo musician and member of Steve Winwood's touring band, joined Widespread Panic on the tenor saxophone for a cover of Firehose's Sometimes. Big Wooly Mammoth, a long-time crowd favorite sung by John \\"JoJo\\" Herman, was finally brought to the studio for this release. Unknown at the time, this would be Michael Houser's last studio album with Widespread Panic, before his cancer-related death in 2002. Songs from Disc Two comprise the first five tracks of the band's June 2002 release Live in the Classic City and are from the opening of the band's April 1, 2000 performance at the Classic Center Theater in Athens, GA. Track 1, \\"Action Man,\\" appears in its original instrumental form unlike the album version, which contains lyrics. The songs \\"Action Man\\" & \\"Give\\" also appeared in the EA Sports video game NASCAR 2001. The album reached a peak position of #57 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album also reached a peak position of #12 on the Top Internet Albums chart.  Track listing  All songs by Widespread Panic unless otherwise noted.

The weapon, the platform and all the associated supporting equipments together form the weapon system. In more general use, a weapons platform could be structured around a gun, such as a gun turret on a ship, or bracing on an aircraft. For example, a jet aircraft is a weapons platform for missiles, bombs or autocannons, and the resultant weapon system is the fighter jet; a motorboat can serve as a weapons platform for automatic weapons, torpedoes and flamethrowers, resulting in weapon systems such as gunboats and fast attack crafts. Land vehicles, either wheeled, tracked or mixed, are also considered weapons platforms for grenade launchers, machine guns, recoilless guns and some missile launchers, which transform the vehicles into weapon systems such as armored cars (such as the Humvee), IFVs and technicals (improvised from civilian pickup trucks). In addition, artificial satellites have been proposed as potential space weapon platforms. These satellites could carry an arsenal of weapons, such as to threaten other countries with the possibility of an orbital nuclear strike (see Rods from God). The earliest weapons platforms were chariots, followed by war wagons. The ancient Greek Helepolis, a massive siege tower which mounted catapults, could also be considered a weapons platform. The next attempt to mount weapons on platforms was made at sea, with catapults and eventually cannon mounted on their final form as ships of the line before the advent of ironclad warships mounting turrets. On land, the attempt to mount weapons on mobile platforms in the modern period was first made with railway guns. These, as forms of artillery, were the last vestiges of development of the super-weapon thinking before the advent of the tanks that changed the use of weapons platforms in warfare, although the largest railway guns were still used during the Second World War on the Eastern Front.
