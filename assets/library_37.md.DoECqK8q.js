Roughly 8,000 years BP, the Laurentide Ice Sheet thinned and split into two lobes, one centred over Quebec-Labrador, the other over Keewatin. This drained Glacial Lake Ojibway, a massive proglacial lake south of the ice sheet, leading to the formation of the early Tyrrell Sea. The weight of the ice had isostatically depressed the surface as much as 270-280 m below its current level, making the Tyrrell Sea much larger than modern Hudson Bay. Indeed, in some places the shoreline was 100 to 250 km farther inland than at present.\\"Geomorphology From Space, Plate C-24: Hudson Bay Shorelines.\\" (Accessed 3/7/06) It was at its largest at roughly 7,000 years BP. Isostatic uplift proceeded rapidly after the retreat of the ice, as much as .09 m per year, causing the margins of the sea to regress quickly towards its present margins. The rate of uplift decreased with time however, and in any event was nearly matched by sea level rise from the melting ice sheets. When the Tyrrell Sea \\"became\\" Hudson Bay is difficult to define, as Hudson Bay is still shrinking from isostatic rebound.

History  A Cuban Montecristo cigar In July 1935, Alonso Men√©ndez purchased the Particulares Factory, makers of the popular Particulares brand and the lesser-known Byron. Immediately after its acquisition, he created a new brand named Montecristo.Habano Magazine, August Issue, 1935 The name for the brand was inspired by the Alexandre Dumas, p√®re novel The Count of Monte Cristo, which was supposedly a very popular choice among the torcedores (cigar rollers) in their factory to have read by the lector on the rolling floor. The now-famous Montecristo logo, consisting of a triangle of six swords surrounding a fleur-de-lis, was designed by John Hunter Morris and Elkan Co. Ltd., the brand's British distributor. In July 1936, Men√©ndez founded a new firm with a partner, naming it Men√©ndez, Garc√≠a y C√≠a.Habano Magazine, August Issue, 1936 With the growing success of the Montecristo brand, the firm purchased the faltering H. Upmann Factory (created by Hermann Dietrich Upmann in 1844) from J. Frankau SA in 1937 and transferred Montecristo production there. J. Frankau continued as sole distributor of the H. Upmann brand in the UK, while John Hunter Morris and Elkan Co. Ltd. was the sole distributor of Montecristo in Britain. In 1963, these firms merged to become \\"Hunters & Frankau\\", which today is the sole importer and distributor of all Cuban cigars in the UK. Through the efforts of Alfred Dunhill (the company), the Montecristo brand became incredibly popular worldwide and to this day accounts for roughly one-quarter of Habanos SA's worldwide cigar sales, making it the most popular Cuban cigar in the world. Men√©ndez and Garc√≠a fled during the Cuban Revolution, and on September 15, 1960, after which the Montecristo brand, the factory, and all assets were nationalized by the government of Fidel Castro.Savona, David, The Exodus, Cigar Aficionado, Nov/Dec. 2002 Men√©ndez and Garc√≠a re-established their brand in the Canary Islands, but were later forced to quit due to trademark disputes with Cubatabaco (later known as Habanos S.A.). In the mid-1970s, the operation was moved to La Romana and released for the US market, since Cuban government rights to the brand were not recognized under American law due to the 1960 nationalization and subsequent embargo. Men√©ndez, Garc√≠a, y C√≠a is now owned by Altadis S.A., who controls its distribution and marketing in the United States. With Menendez and Garcia gone after 1959, one of the top grade torcedores, Jos√© Manuel Gonz√°lez, was promoted to floor manager and proceeded to breathe new life into the brand. In the 1970s and 1980s, five new sizes were added: the A, the Especial No. 1 and 2, the Joyita, and the Petit Tubo. Three other sizes, the Montecristo No. 6, No. 7, and B, were released but subsequently discontinued, though the B can occasionally be found in very small releases each year in Cuba. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Montecristo continued to rise in popularity among cigar smokers, becoming one of Cuba's top selling cigar lines. Today The Montecristo No. 2 is the most popular cigar in the world market. In 2004 the Edmundo was added, a large robusto-sized cigar named for the hero of Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, Edmond Dant√®s. Montecristo is regularly chosen to be featured in Habanos SA's annual Edici√≥n Limitada selection of cigars with a darker vintage wrapper, and issues numerous limited editions of cigars for special occasions, anniversaries, the annual Habanos Festival, charities, etc. In 2007, a cigar called the Edmundo Dantes Conde 109 was released as a part of Habanos' regional edition series. It uses a Montecristo blend and is believed to have a different name because of trademark right problems in Mexico. A new, lighter-bodied line was released at the 11th Habanos Festival in February 2009. The planned name for the new line had been Sport, but because of EU regulations prohibiting marketing tobacco with sports imagery, the name was changed to Open with vitola names inspired by sports such as golf and yachting. Montecristo also produces three machine-made cigarillos: the Mini, the Club, and the Purito. =Vitolas= box of Cuban Montecristo Joyitas The following list of vitolas de salida (commercial vitolas) within the Montecristo marque lists their size and ring gauge in Imperial (and Metric), their vitolas de galera (factory vitolas), and their common name in American cigar slang.

Eligible buyers planning to shift into a new HDB apartment in the near future, can apply for apartments in their preferred location from specific sites launched. Tender for construction will be called only if the number of applicants is at least 70% of the number of apartments in a specific contract (50% since 2011), otherwise, the project is not built. The waiting time for new flat applicants under the old Registration for Flats System (RFS) is relatively short because flats are built ahead of demand. In comparison, the new BTO system requires a waiting period of about 3‚Äì4 years instead as such a system removes the need for the government to make projections ahead of demand. For eligible flat buyers in urgent need of accommodation, they can ballot for leftover units that are reintroduced into the market, Sales of Balance flats (SBF). In February 2019, it was announced that starting from the middle of 2019, flat buyers will be able to apply for unsold BTO flats online anytime on a first-come, first-served basis, and book a flat by the next working day. This is to help citizens with urgent needs for housing. All BTO projects are designed by Surbana Corporation. To allow private sector a share of the public housing pie, HDB launched the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS). The first pilot DBSS project at Tampines would be built by private developer, Sim Lian Group, but maintained by the HDB after construction. However, in 2011, then National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan suspended the DBSS scheme indefinitely.

The opt-in basic cost are usually about 20~30% cheaper due to bulk purchases and less labour charges. But those who want variety of timber or bi-fold doors design, and better homogeneous/porcelain tiles or tiles/timber skirting can opt out of the schemes. * Universal Design (UD) - These include ramps at main entrance, levelled floors throughout the flat, wider internal corridors, bedroom and toilet doors, wheelchair-accessible common toilet, space provision for future installation of grab bars in all toilets, as well as easily accessible switch sockets, TV outlets and telephone outlets.

A ferrolite wall uses 20 per cent less sand than a concrete one. It is less susceptible to cracking and heat from the sun and has better sound-insulation capabilities. It is a piloted project launched from 2006 for selective Fernvale Court, Treelodge and Kim Tian Green. BTO Projects Build To Order system was introduced in 2001. The demand for BTO flats was low in the first years, resulting in the cancellation of 5 projects as it did not meet the requirement of minimum 70% application ratio. However, once the demand recovered, HDB has launched between 20 and 40 BTO projects annually since 2010, which consists of 15,000-28,000 units. By the end of 2015, HDB has launched 251 BTO projects, comprising 168453 units.List of BTO projects Awarded BTO main contractors tender, each construction costs per 5-room, 4-room, 3-room & 2-room units are likely to be average about $160,000, $120,000, $80,000 & $40,000 (based on 2004 cost) respectively.

He was one of the three members of S. A. Andr√©e's ill-fated Arctic balloon expedition of 1897. Biography Nils Strindberg was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of wholesaler Johan Oscar Strindberg and Aurora Helena Rosalie Lundgren. His younger brother, Tore Strindberg (1882-1968), was a noted sculptor. His father's cousin was playwright and novelist, August Strindberg (1849‚Äì1912). Strindberg graduated from Norra Real in Stockholm during 1890. He received his Bachelor of Arts (fil.kand.) at Uppsala University in 1893. In 1895, received a post as lector at the Stockholm University. In the spring of 1896 he traveled to Paris to study gas balloon flight. Strindberg was invited to the Arctic balloon expedition of 1897 to create a photographic aerial record of the arctic. Before perishing on Kvit√∏ya with Andr√©e and Knut Fr√¶nkel, Strindberg recorded on film their long doomed struggle on foot to reach populated areas. When the remains of the expedition were discovered by the Bratvaag Expedition in 1930, five exposed rolls of film were found, one of them still in the camera. Docent John Hertzberg of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm managed to save 93 of the theoretically 240 frames. A selection of these photos were published along with the diaries of the expedition as Med √ñrnen mot Polen (Stockholm: Bonnier (1930); British edition The Andr√©e diaries (1931); American edition Andr√©e's Story (1932). The book credited the three explorers as its authors. In an article from 2004, Tyrone Martinsson published some digitally enhanced versions of Strindberg's photos of the expedition, while lamenting the lack of care with which the original negatives were stored from 1944. Strindberg's so-called \\"shorthand\\" diary from the expedition has the form of messages to his fianc√©e, Anna Charlier (1871-1949), and provides a more personal window on events than Andr√©e's own diaries. Strindberg's body and those of the other two explorers were brought back to Sweden for a funeral with great honors. After cremation, their ashes were interred together at the cemetery Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

Charlemont with Grove Vale is a political ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, in the English Midlands constituency of West Bromwich East. This Sandwell ward population as taken at the 2011 census was 11,964. The ward is made up of several neighbourhoods including Charlemont Farm, Bustlehome Mill, Church Vale, and the leafier neighbourhoods of Charlemont, Bird End, Wigmore and Grove Vale. It also covers part of the Sandwell Valley. The ward has 3 Labour Party councillors: Elizabeth Giles, Sue Phillips and Liam Preece, elected in 2019.  History  The area became known as 'Charly Mount' by c.1723 and was home to Charlemont Hall, proceeded by Crump Hall. The hall stood on the east side of the present day Charlemont Crescent until 1948. The ward was also home to Wigmore School, erected in 1872, for the maintenance and education of Children chargeable to the Walsall and West Bromwich Poor Law Unions. The buildings, situated on a hill overlooking the Tame Valley, were erected in the Elizabethan style, and included an Infirmary. Following the Local Government Act 1929, all poor law responsibility was transferred to the Local Authority, and Wigmore was administered by the Education Committee. From 1935, Wigmore became an \\"Approved School\\" which continued until the 1960s when it was transferred for use as Sandwell Council Offices. The building failed to get listed building status and despite local pressure was demolished by Sandwell Council in 2002, to make way for a new housing development. The Gatehouse is still in existence. With private and council residential developments growing in the 1920s, an infant school opened in the area in 1929 and was followed a year later by new junior and senior schools. The buildings were expanded in 1937, with the senior school becoming a secondary modern school in 1944. However, its popularity fell after the opening of nearby Churchfields High School in 1955 (this school eventually closed in July 2001) and the senior school closed in 1967. Bishop Asbury Cottage is located on the A4041 Newton Road on the Grove Vale/Great Barr border. The 18th century cottage, now a Grade II listed museum was the boyhood home of Francis Asbury, the first American Methodist Bishop. Hallam, David J.A. Eliza Asbury: her cottage and her son, Studley 2003 The ward is covered by the Diocese of Lichfield and the areas most historic church, All Saints is located on the A4031 (All Saints Way). There has been a church on this spot dating back to the Norman period. The current church was mostly rebuilt, except the tower, in 1872 where it lost its Patronage which was originally St Clement, and subsequent years when it was enlarged. Buried in the church yard are a number of well known people including James Eaton (1785‚Äì1857) who served in the T√©m√©raire at the Battle of Trafalgar and as signal midshipman, repeated Nelson's message to the fleet. And also James Keir, a member of the Lunar Society who lived at Finchpath Hall at Hill Top from 1770 and was buried at All Saints' in 1820. At about 1830, a pound, stocks, and whipping-post stood at the corner of Hollyhedge Road and Heath Lane opposite All Saints' Church. All three were then moved to a site in front of the Ring of Bells at the junction of All Saints Street and Church Vale. The stocks and whipping-post were apparently taken away when the West Bromwich police force was established in 1840. In 1970, the pound still stood, and the stocks were preserved in the grounds of the Oak House. Much of the area around Charlemont and Grove Vale was developed for private and council housing from the 1920s until the 1970s. The author and countryside campaigner John Bainbridge spent his childhood at 15 Ray Hall Lane and was educated at Grove Vale School. Charlemont Farm was one of the largest housing developments in the area at its time. It was built in the 1960s to include houses, bungalows, low-rise flats and high-rise flats, many of which have since been demolished with new developments being built in their place. On March 3 2015, former Charlemont with Grove Vale councillor Tony Ward was made an honorary alderman of Sandwell. He served as a Conservative councillor in the ward for 11 years from 2003 to 2014.

Usually cast as an Irishman or Englishman, his small stature, distinctive voice, and face made him easily recognizable in even the most minor of roles.  Early life  Burke was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City to Irish immigrant parents Thomas Burke and Bedelia McNamara Burke. He had one brother and two sisters. His father bred trotting horses, with one farm each in Ireland and Scotland.  Career  Walter Burke began acting on stage as a teenager, making his Broadway debut in Dearest Enemy at the Knickerbocker Theatre during 1925‚Äì1926. The following year he performed in a musical revue, Padlocks of 1927 at the Shubert Theatre. He joined the American Opera Company's troupe in January 1928, performing a non-singing role in an English-language adaption of Faust.\\"A New Version of 'Faust'\\" in the New York Times, January 11, 1928, p. 26. He continued with that company through January 1930, taking part in adaptions of Madame Butterfly and Yolanda of Cyprus at the Casino Theatre.\\"'Yolanda' Sung by Americans\\" in the New York Times, January 9, 1930, p. 28. He next appeared on Broadway with Help Yourself in 1936, and over the next ten years appeared in as many plays. Burke debuted in Hollywood films in 1948, with The Naked City, and the following year had a memorable role in the Oscar-winning film All the King's Men. Burke would appear in twenty-two more films, and three more Broadway productions, but both film and the stage would soon take a backseat to his television work. In 1951, Burke played a jockey in the early television series Martin Kane. From then until 1980, he would appear in episodes of 103 different television series, as well as three made-for- television movies. Though never a series regular, he often played different roles in multiple episodes of the same shows. In 1959‚Äì60, he appeared five times as Tim Potter in the ABC western series Black Saddle starring Peter Breck. That same season, he appeared on Andrew Duggan's Bourbon Street Beat and John Cassavetes's Johnny Staccato detective series. He portrayed defendant Freddie Green in CBS's Perry Mason in the 1959 episode, \\"The Case of the Jaded Joker,\\" the first of five appearances in diverse roles. In 1960 he played prosecutor James Blackburn in \\"The Case of the Ominous Outcast.\\" Among his other roles he played a panhandler and a private detective. He guest starred as Hatfield in the 1961 episode \\"The Drought\\" of the syndicated western series Two Faces West. In the 1962‚Äì1963 season, he appeared on the CBS anthology series The Lloyd Bridges Show. In the 1965‚Äì1966 season, Burke appeared on another ABC western, The Legend of Jesse James. Burke played a magician called \\"Zeno the Great\\" in a 1965 (first season) episode of Bewitched entitled \\"It's Magic\\". Burke also appeared on an episode of Lost in Space, playing Mr. O.M. in \\"The Toymaker\\" (1967). He also appeared in an episode of \\"Wild Wild West\\" as the mayor of a town under siege, in Hogan's Heroes as the master safe cracker Alfie the Artiste, and in two episodes of \\"Bonanza\\", as Jesse in \\"Destiny's Child\\", and as an unsuspecting witness in a trial. In 1970 Burke appeared as Billy Neal in the western TV series The Virginian in the episode titled \\"The Gift.\\"  Personal life  Burke split most of his later life between Hollywood, where he worked, and his farm in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. While back east, he would sometimes teach dramatics at a local college.  Death  On August 4, 1984, Burke died from emphysema while living at the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

It consisted of a tube of viscous plastic substance and a thin straw used to blow semi-solid bubbles. A pea-sized amount of liquid plastic was squeezed from the tube and made into a ball. One end of the straw was then inserted into the ball, and the user would blow into the other end, inflating the plastic into a bubble. The bubble could then be removed from the straw by pinching the hole closed, sealing the air inside. The size of each bubble depended on the amount of plastic used. Roughly the consistency of bubblegum, the bubbles formed were much more durable than simple soap bubbles, and could be gently manipulated to make different shapes, and stacked to make simple figures such as snowmen. However, they were not as durable as regular balloons, and could pop easily if overinflated, handled with too much force, or squeezed. Chemically, the bubbles contained polyvinyl acetate dissolved in acetone, with ethyl acetate plastic fortifiers added. The acetone evaporated upon bubble inflation leaving behind a solid plastic film. Besides the potential for spills when liquid plastic was handled by children, the substance also emitted noxious fumes. The fumes could become concentrated inside the straw, making it dangerous to inhale through the straw while inflating a bubble. The toy was not recommended for children under 5. Because of these problems, Super Elastic Bubble Plastic was eventually discontinued.Goldberg Goff, Karen (June 8, 2008). \\"Toys of Summer\\". The Washington Times.

However, the incident was revealed in 1986 to be a plot by the government, a False flag operation, much to the embarrassment of the government. The Verfassungsschutz used the name 'Operation Fire Magic' (). The secret services used a stolen Mercedes SL, driven by two criminals named Klaus-Dieter Loudil and Manfred Berger, who were recruited by the secret services. In the car were forged passports, one passport with a photograph of Sigurd Debus. Serial numbers of the passports showed that they were stolen from German authorities. Mr. Debus was an inmate in the Celle prison. He was considered as a Red Army Faction terrorist suspect. Some tools to be used for a prison escape attempt were brought secretly to Mr. Debus' prison cell by the secret services. Prison wall behind the river Aller The action should have had taken place one night earlier when twelve secret service officers, one GSG 9 demolition squad officer and J√ºrgen Wiehe, a civil servant in the ministry of interior of the state of Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) waited for the right moment to detonate the bomb on July 24. But they had to interrupt the action since two lovers coming from the nearby funfair entered the danger area. So the action was deferred. On July 25, 1978 at 2.54 a.m. the bomb was detonated at the outer prison wall, but caused minor damage only. No inmate was able to escape. The Mercedes was caught later in Salzgitter (80 km away) in a police road block, the driver escaped. The false passports and some ammunition was found in the car. In Celle, a 1.5 square meter hole, named the Celle hole (Celler Loch), was left in the outer prison wall. A handgun, model Walther PPK 7.65, which was the official pistol of one of the secret service officers, as well as a rubber dinghy, were found. Celle prison is situated close to the bank of river Aller. After the detonation, Mr. Debus' conditions of detention were aggravated \\"for security reasons\\". The secret service had planted escape tools into Debus' cell, which were found in the search after the attack, and was supposed to prove Debus' participation. Hence, the detainee started a hunger strike as a protest against this. Sigurd Debus died on April 16, 1981 shortly before the date of his discharge from prison.

Rutkowski also took part in many TV footages and popularized shows like the Detektyw series of the TVN station, which depicts the life and methods of a private detective. Later in his career, Rutkowski rescued many kidnapped people, including Polish women who had married Muslim men and could not escape the harsh reality of the Middle-East and wanted to return to Poland, but were mistreated and detained by their husbands and families. Rutkowski captured numerous criminals who were hiding abroad and could not be extradited.

Located seven miles north of Woodbridge, in 2005 it had a population of 300, reducing to 263 at the 2011 census and according to the 2011 census there were 129 males and 134 females living at this time. The flint-built parish church of St Mary, though restored in 1886, dates from the late 14th Century and was likely built for William de Ufford. The Rood screen is from the 15th Century. Parham is located on the B1116. William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham is interred in the church, too. Parham Airfield Museum is located nearby. Parham railway station, on the Framlingham Branch, was shut to passenger traffic in November 1952. Between 1870 and 1872 John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer visited Parham and wrote the following as an entry for the parish. > PARHAM, a village and a parish in Plomesgate district, Suffolk. The village > stands on the river Ore, adjacent to the Framlingham branch of the East > Suffolk railway, 2¬º miles S S E of Framlingham; and has a station on the > railway, and a post-office under Wickham-Market. The parish comprises 2, 212 > acres.  Occupation Structure  The occupational structure (1881) of Parham was very agricultural based although there are a lot of 'unspecified' or 'unknown'. There were 77 males and 3 females working in farming and agriculture in 1881 There was 1 male who was employed in the armed forces as seen in the occupational structure graph below. There were 2 males employed in the conveyance of goods, men and messages, these people working as railway officials or servants. There were 2 female dominated positions in the village in 1881; these were Domestic Offices or Services, in which 1 male and 19 females worked, and education and religion in which 1 male and 15 females were employed. The occupation of the population of Parham in 2001 was very different to the occupational structure in 1881. The total number of the population in Parham, aged 16‚Äì71, that was in employment in 2001 was 132. The breakdown of this shows that 17 people from Parham worked in agriculture, relating to hunting and forestry, around 12% of the working population. There were 11 people working in manufacturing, 3 people from Parham were in employment by electricity, gas and water supply, 15 people worked in construction, 17 people who lived in Parham worked as a wholesaler or retail trade, and the repair of motor vehicles, 6 people worked in Hotels or catering, 8 people, worked in transport storage and communication. 3 people worked in financial intermediation, 16 people worked in real estate 7 people worked in public administration. 10 people were in full-time education, 12 were employed into health and social work and finally, 7 people were employed as \\"other\\". The 2011 census also asked for peoples industries and occupation, there were more people working in Parham in 2011, rising to 137 from 132,. The breakdown shows that 7 people worked in agriculture, forestry and fishing, with 1 person working in mining and quarrying, and 12 people working in various manufacturing jobs. 1 person worked in water supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation services, 6 people worked in construction, and 22 people or 16% of the working population worked in wholesale and retail trade, this includes the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles. 3 people work in transport and storage, whilst 7 people worked in accommodation and food service activities. 8 people worked in information and communication and 2 people worked in financial and insurance activities, with 1 person working in real estate. 13 people worked in professional scientific and technical activities. 8 people were employed in administrative and support service activities, and 8 people were also employed in public administration and defence. 16 people were working in education. 19 people worked in human health and social work. whilst 2 people worked in arts, entertainment and recreation, with 1 person working in household activities as an employer. 170x170px  Population  Population of Parham 1801 -2011 shows that Parham's population has been declining, going from 399 in 1801, to 263 in 2011. There has been some fluctuation in the population of Parham however, rising to a high of 532 in 1851 after rising steadily in prior years. Since 1851, the population steadily declined, as seen in the graph, only rising again in 1951, after the baby boom after the second world war ended. The population is the lowest it has been recorded. The current population level is 263, which is a density level of 0.3 which is incredibly low compared to towns in the surrounding area, such as Framlingham. 170x170px  Religion  The primary religion in Parham is the Church of England, with this being the confession of the parish church. As of 2001, 245 people identified as Christian, however, by the 2011 census this had decreased to just 171, there has also been a decline between 2001 and 2011 in those who identify as either other, from 3 to 1, and those who do not state their religion, from 31 down to 19. In contrast, the number identifying as no religion has increased from 28 to 71 between 2011 and 2011.170x170px  Housing and Deprivation  The amount of housing in Parham has varied over time, in 1831, the number of houses in the village was just 59, however, 10 years later, in 1841 the amount of housing had increased to 100, this could have been due to industrialisation of the area and people moving to Parham for work. The number of houses in the area stayed at around 100, except for in 1851 when the amount of housing rose to 109, but then falling back down to 100 at the next census date in 1881. in the time from 1891 and 1901, some houses were either knocked down or the parish's boundary lines changed as there were only 96 houses in the village in 1901, dropping from 101 in 1891. This number again rose and fell, during wartime Britain, ranging from a low in 1931 with only 80 houses, and raising back up to 97 in 1961. Using modern census data, from both 2001 and 2011, we can compare the village size with previous years, in the 2001 data we can see that the number of households in the village was 95, with 27 being 1 person households. There were 64 houses that had families in, and 4 houses which were used for \\"other purposes\\". In 2011, there were 95 houses in Parham, again with 27 being one person households, there was 62 houses that were owned by families. There were 4 households describes as \\"other in this census.\\" In the 2011 census, households were asked to answer questions about deprivation within the household, ranking over 4 dimensions these deprivation dimensions are \\"Employment, Education, Health and disability, and Household overcrowding.\\", this deprivation level is low for Parham, with 60 households out of the 106 in the town not being deprived in any dimension. There were 32 households that were deprived in 1 dimension. there were 11 houses that were considered to be deprived in 2 dimensions and 3 households that were deprived in 3 dimensions, and 0 households that were deprived in all 4 of the dimensions.  Demographics  In the 2001 census, the number of people who identified as \\"White (British)\\" was 297, of the 303 people who lived in the village. This works out to be 98% of the population that identifies as a white British person. The rest of the town, which was only 6 people, identified as \\"white (Other)\\" This changed in the 2011 census, where, of the 263 people who lived in the village at the time, 253 identified as white British, which is a decrease to 96% of the population of Parham. There were 10 people who identified as something other than white British, these was 1 person who identified as Irish, 5 people who identified as other white, 1 who identified as \\"mixed/multiple ethnic groups, White and Black Caribbean, and 3 who identified as mixed/multiple ethnic groups; White and Asian. this shows that the village is becoming more diverse.

It is set in Dublin and addresses the 1916 Easter Rising. The play's title references the Starry Plough flag which was used by the Irish Citizen Army. It is the third play of O'Casey's well-known \\"Dublin Trilogy\\" ‚Äì the other two being The Shadow of a Gunman (1923) and Juno and the Paycock (1924). Plot The first two acts take place in November 1915, looking forward to the liberation of Ireland. The last two acts are set during the Easter Rising, in April 1916. =Characters= Residents of the tenement house: *Jack Clitheroe: a bricklayer and former member of the Irish Citizen Army. *Nora Clitheroe: housewife of Jack Clitheroe. *Peter Flynn: a labourer, and uncle of Nora Clitheroe. *The Young Covey: a fitter, ardent socialist and cousin of Jack Clitheroe. *Bessie Burgess: a street fruit-vendor, and Protestant. *Mrs Gogan: a charwoman. *Mollser Gogan: daughter of Mrs Gogan, dying from consumption. *Fluther Good: a carpenter, and trade-unionist. Additional characters: *Lieutenant Langon: a civil servant, and lieutenant of the Irish Volunteers. *Captain Brennan: a chicken butcher, and captain of the Irish Citizen Army. *Corporal Stoddard: a corporal of the Wiltshire Regiment of the British Army. *Sergeant Tinley: a sergeant of the Wiltshire Regiment of the British Army. *Rosie Redmond: a daughter of \\"the Digs,\\" and a prostitute. *A Bartender. *The Portrait In The Window: Unmentioned but uses quotes attributed to Padraig Pearse. =Act I= The first act is a representation of normal working-class life in early twentieth century Dublin. The majority of major characters are introduced. The act opens with gossip from Mrs Gogan, a Catholic charwoman. Some other characters introduced are: Fluther Good, a trade unionist and carpenter; \\"the Young Covey\\", an ardent communist and fitter; Jack Clitheroe, the Covey's uncle and a former member of the Irish Citizen Army, at that time led by James Connolly. There is also Nora Clitheroe; Jack Clitheroe's wife. Later in this act, Captain Brennan knocks on the door of the Clitheroes' home and asks to see \\"Commandant Clitheroe\\", which surprises Jack Clitheroe, as he was not aware he'd been promoted. Nora begs him not to answer the door, but he does, and meets Captain Brennan, a chicken butcher and a member of the Irish Citizen Army. Captain Brennan hands Jack Clitheroe his orders telling him that he and his battalion are ordered to join General James Connolly at a meeting. Jack Clitheroe asks why he was not informed that he was made commandant. Captain Brennan claims he gave a letter to Nora Clitheroe explaining his new promotion. This is when Jack Clitheroe starts fighting with Nora because Nora burned the letter that told Jack Clitheroe he was promoted. =Act II= This act was originally a single-act play, called The Cooing of Doves. The setting is the interior of a public house. A political rally is in progress outside. From time to time an unnamed man is heard addressing the crowd. His words are taken from various speeches and writings of Patrick Pearse. Rosie Redmond, a prostitute, is complaining to the barman that the meeting is bad for business. Peter Flynn, Fluther Good and Young Covey come in and leave again at intervals, having a quick drink during the speeches. Bessie Burgess and Mrs. Gogan also come in, and a fight breaks out between them. After they have left, Covey insults Rosie, leading to a row between him and Fluther. Jack Clitheroe, Lieutenant Langon and Captain Brennan enter the bar, in uniform and carrying The Plough and the Stars flag and a green, white and orange tricolour. They are so moved by the speeches that they are determined to face imprisonment, injury or death for Ireland. They drink quickly and leave again in time to march their respective companies away. Fluther leaves with Rosie. =Act III= This takes place on Easter Monday, the opening day of the Easter Rising. Peter, Mrs Gogan and the Covey discuss the fighting that is going on and the Covey informs Mrs Gogan that Patrick Pearse came out of the General Post Office with his men to read out the Proclamation of Irish Independence. Bessie gloats about the Rebels' imminent defeat but is ignored by the others. Nora shows up with Fluther after having searched for Jack in the midst of the fighting unsuccessfully. As Mrs Gogan leads her inside to lie down Bessie leaves to get some bread and comes back shortly informing the others that looting has broken out everywhere. A fashionably dressed middle-aged woman enters and asks the men to show her a safe route back to her home in Rathmines because the fighting has made it impossible to find a taxi or tram to take her back. Fluther tells her that any route is as safe as the others and leaves with the Covey to loot a nearby pub without helping her. Peter refuses to help her on the grounds that he might be shot and left with a limp and leaves her alone outside the tenement. Mrs Gogan attempts to leave the house pushing a pram until Bessie rushes after her claiming that the pram's owner left her in charge of it. The argument concludes with the two women agreeing to split the spoils. Brennan and Jack appear with a wounded rebel and Nora rushes to meet with them. She attempts to convince Jack to leave the fight and stay with her, telling him that she had gone out asking for his whereabouts when she hadn't gotten any news. Angered by her actions and the shame they brought upon him Jack ignores Nora's pleas and pushes her away roughly before leaving with his comrades. Nora then goes into labour. =Act IV= This takes place later in the rising. Mollser, a local girl, has died of tuberculosis, while Nora has had a stillbirth. She is delirious, imagining herself walking in the woods with Jack. Brennan arrives and tells the others that Jack has been shot dead. Two British soldiers arrive and escort the men away ‚Äî civilians are suspected of aiding a rebel sniper. Nora goes to a window, calling for Jack; when Bessie pulls her away, Bessie is shot in the back, mistaken for a sniper.  Attempted censorship  When O'Casey first submitted the play to the Abbey Theatre directors objections arose concerning the use of blasphemy and profanities along with the presence of a prostitute in the play. After a board of directors' meeting O'Casey agreed to modify some of the terms used as well as to cut out Rosie Redmond's song in act II that was deemed as being especially offensive. George O'Brien, the government nominee on the Abbey Theatre's board of directors, argued that a theatre that received a state subsidy should reflect the values of the state and that disregarding this could lead to the formation of hostile movements that would make it difficult for the government to continue funding the Abbey. Viewing this as a threat, Lady Gregory wrote to O'Brien stating that \\"If we have to choose between the subsidy and our freedom, it is our freedom we choose.\\" Yeats agreed with Lady Gregory and argued that removing any part of the play for reasons relating to anything other than dramatic tradition would be denying their traditions. Riots The play was first performed in front of a sold out crowd at Abbey Theatre due to the fact that a large portion of the seats had been reserved for government officials. The play was well received on February 8, 1926. its opening night, although Lennox Robinson wrote to Lady Gregory following the performance stating that the audience had been very excited, which made it a \\"bad audience to judge a play by\\". The first sign of displeasure among the audience occurred during the second act of the second performance of the play when Sighle Humphreys, a member of the Cumann na mBan, started to hiss from the back of the pit. When the curtains rose on February 11 to another full house the presence of Cumann na mBan and Sinn Fein members was hard to ignore. The women representing Cumann na mBan at the performance were all in some way related to men that had lost their lives during the Easter Rising, which created an atmosphere of expectations in the theater surrounding the topic of the Rising from the moment the play started. The riots began during the play's second act when Rosie Redmond, a prostitute, is seen lounging in the pub awaiting clients as the Figure in the Window, using the words of Patrick Pearse, declares that 'Bloodshed is a cleansing and a sanctifying thing, and the nation that regards it as the final horror has lost its manhood'. In contrasting the character of Rosie with the Figure's speech O'Casey compares the ideal dream of the patriots with what W. B. Yeats called the normal grossness of life. Clitheroe, Langon and Brennan then enter the stage in uniforms carrying the tricolour flag of the Irish Volunteers and the plough- and-stars flag of the Irish Citizen Army, which was perceived as an insult to the men who had died during the Rising. Some of the play's actors attempted to distance themselves from the roles they had played by asking the rioters to distinguish between the actors and the play, which was responded to in kind by a voice from the pit yelling \\"you have no right to earn your bread by insulting Ireland\\". Upon arriving to the theatre as the riots were ongoing, Yeats famously declared to rioters against the play, making a reference to the 1907 \\"Playboy Riots\\" (opposing The Playboy of the Western World by John Millington Synge): \\"I thought you had tired of this, which commenced fifteen years ago. But you have disgraced yourselves again. Is this going to be a recurring celebration of Irish genius? Synge first and then O'Casey.\\" In performance In 1984 Greg Hersov directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Liam Neeson, Dierdra Morris, Bernard Hill and Val McLane. * In 2016 the National Theatre co-produced (with Bristol Old Vic) a well-received production, co-directed by Howard Davies and Jeremy Herrin. Adaptations Elie Siegmeister used the play as the subject of his opera of the same name, composed in the 1960s. The opera was given its New York premiere at Symphony Space in October 1979 by the New York Lyric Opera. In 1936, the play was adapted into a film by American director John Ford, starring Barbara Stanwyck and Preston Foster. In 2011, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a production directed by Nadia Molinari with Elaine Cassidy as Nora and Padraic Delaney as Jack.

Gelzer quotes Broughton to assert that Caesar was quaestor in 69. Gelzer then explains that Caesar, after taking on his place of duty, delivered an oration in praise of his aunt Julia. Shortly after this, his wife died too. when Julia was only seven years old, after which she was raised by her paternal grandmother Aurelia Cotta. Her father engaged her to a Servilius Caepio.

(Caesar's most famous assassin), who, after being adopted by his uncle, was known as Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus for an unknown period of time. This is just conjecture. Caesar broke off this engagement and married her to Pompey in April 59 BC, with whom Caesar sought a strong political alliance in forming the First Triumvirate. This family-alliance of its two great chiefs was regarded as the firmest bond between Caesar and Pompey, and was accordingly viewed with much alarm by the optimates (the oligarchal party in Rome), especially by Marcus Tullius Cicero and Cato the Younger.Cicero, Letters to Atticus, ii. 17, viii. 3.Plutarch, Life of Caesar, 14; Pompey, 48; Cato the Younger, 31.Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar, 50. Pompey was supposedly infatuated with his bride. The personal charms of Julia were remarkable: she was a kind woman of beauty and virtue; and although policy prompted her union, and she was thirty years younger than her husband, she possessed in Pompey a devoted husband, to whom she was, in return, reportedly attached.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 48. A rumor suggested that the middle aged conqueror was losing interest in politics in favor of domestic life with his young wife. In fact, Pompey had been given the governorship of Hispania Ulterior, but had been permitted to remain in Rome to oversee the Roman grain supply as curator annonae, exercising his command through subordinates.Plutarch, Life of Pompey, 53. Julia died before a breach between her husband and father had become inevitable.Velleius Paterculus, ii. 44, 47. Plutarch reports that at the election of aediles in 55 BC, Pompey was surrounded by a tumultuous mob, and his gown was stained with blood of the rioters. A slave carried the stained toga to his house on the Carinae and was seen by Julia. Imagining that her husband was slain, she fell into premature labor,Valerius Maximus, Memorable Deeds and Sayings, iv. 6. ¬ß 4. and her constitution received an irreparable shock. In August of the next year, 54 BC, she died in child birth,William Smith (ed.), A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography, 1851. and her infant‚Äîa son, according to some writers,Velleius Paterculus, ii. 47.Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar, 26.Lucanus, v. 474, ix. 1049. a daughter, according to others,Dio Cassius, xxxix. 64.‚Äîdid not survive and died along with Julia.Dio Cassius, xl. 44. Caesar was in Britain, according to Seneca,Seneca, To Marcia, On consolation, xiv. 3. when he received the news of Julia's death.Cicero, Oration for Publius Quinctius, iii. 1; Letters to Atticus, iv. 17. Pompey wished her ashes to repose in his favourite Alban villa, but the Roman people, who loved Julia, determined they should rest in the field of Mars (Campus Martius). For permission a special decree of the senate was necessary, and Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, one of the consuls of 54 BC, impelled by his hatred for Pompey and Caesar, procured an interdict from the tribunes. But the popular will prevailed, and, after listening to a funeral orationIn Latin: laudatio funebris. in the forum, the people placed her urn in the field of Mars.Dio Cassius, xxxix. 64; xlviii. 53. Ten years later the official pyre for Caesar's cremation would be erected near the tomb of his daughter,Suetonius, Life of Julius Caesar, 84.Livy, Ad urbe condita preserved by a 4th century summary entitled Periochae, cxvi. 6. but the people intervened after the funeral oration by Marcus Antonius and cremated Caesar's body in the Forum. After Julia‚Äôs death, Pompey and Caesar‚Äôs alliance began to fade, which resulted in Caesar's civil war. It was allegedly remarked, as a singular omen, that on the day Augustus entered Rome as Caesar's adoptive son (in May 44 BC), the monument of Julia was struck by lightning.Suetonius, Life of Augustus, 95; compare Life of Julius Caesar , 84. Caesar himself vowed a ceremony to her manes, which he exhibited in 46 BC as extensive funeral games including gladiatorial combats.Dio Cassius, xliii. 22. The date of the ceremony was chosen to coincide with the ludi Veneris Genetricis on September 26,John T. Ramsey, A.

Because Roman daughters typically received praenomina only if they had several elder sisters, the elder sister came to be known as \\"Julia Major\\", and the younger as \\"Julia Minor\\", when it was necessary to distinguish between them. It is not known if it was the elder or the younger of the dictator's sisters who gave evidence against Publius Clodius Pulcher when he was impeached for impiety in 61 BC.

Samungli currently houses two PAF squadrons flying the Chengdu F-7PG and CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder combat aircraft.https://www.geo.tv/latest/184155-paf- raises-new-jf-17-squadronhttp://www.quickjobs.pk/mcqs/current-affairs-of- pakistan-february-2018.html History During the years of the Royal Pakistan Air Force (RPAF), the base was known as RPAF Station Samungli. The base was commanded by Major Sikandar Khan of the Pakistan Army from 14 May to 12 July 1954. Squadron Leader K. M. Akbar of the RPAF took over as base commander and commanded a newly established GC Wing. In June 1957 an annual training camp, Shaheen Air Training Corps was inaugurated, commanded by Squadron Leader J. Z. Mikulski who was assisted by Flying Officer A. Hanif and Sergeants Sabir, Zahoor and Hussain. That month saw the SATC wings from Dacca, Sargodha, Drigh Road and Chaklala participating in the training camp. Wings from Lahore and Peshawar followed them in July. In October 1970 the Care and Maintenance (C&M;) Party Samungli was redesignated as PAF Base Samungli and it was proposed that two squadrons would be based there by 1974. From 1970 to 1978 the base saw fighter squadrons from Masroor, Sargodha and Peshawar deploying during summertime for several weeks. College students were invited to annual summer camps. Firepower and close air support demonstrations were held each summer for Quetta Staff College students by various PAF squadrons, the biggest in September 1976 by No. 5, 7, 11, 15 and 18 Squadrons. The tradition continues today although mostly by the squadrons now based at Samungli. PAF Base Samungli was converted from a satellite base to a main operating base on 31 March 1978, after which the No. 23 Squadron was permanently deployed there. Later the No. 17 Squadron was also based at Samungli and the two squadrons were assigned to the No. 31 Wing established in May 1983. The setting up of air defence units began in 1981 after HQ No. 4 Sector and its component units was moved nearby due to the Soviet-Afghan war. Originally the officers' mess was in a small hut-type building. The SNCO's mess and airmen's mess were in a World War II era barracks. These were replaced by the end of 1981 when new messes, domestic accommodation and a 20-bed hospital were built. On 26 May 1981 an Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-8 helicopter was hijacked from Qandahar and landed at Samungli. On 15 May 1982 the base held a colour presentation ceremony for the No. 23 Squadron after the unit was officially reassigned an air superiority role.http://www.geocities.ws/pafwebsite/AirBasessamungli.html The base has been used by the United States for military logistical operations in support of the 2001 war in Afghanistan.

Both the Church of Ireland and Catholic church have Tydavnet named as a parish and in both cases, the geographical area is almost identical. The village is located on the R186 regional road. Origins The origin of the name is from that of a 6th-century Irish Saint Damnat, who is thought to have founded a church in the area (generally considered to have been located in the graveyard of the current village Catholic church). The village contains one of the three existing Catholic churches in the parish, the others located in Urbleshanny, near Scotstown and in Corlat. The Tydavnet Catholic church was originally erected in 1730, then rebuilt in the early 1900s and the interior renovated in the 1990s. The village is linked with Geel in Belgium which also has a strong Saint Dymphna connection. Tydavnet/Monaghan and Geel were officially twinned in 1992.

It was published on 28 November 1939.Dudley Edwards, Owen (2007). British Children's Fiction in the Second World War. Edinburgh University Press. p.120. This book is set in and around Hamford Water in Essex, close to the resort town of Walton-on-the-Naze. It starts only a few days after We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea ends. It brings the Swallows and the Amazons together and introduces a new group of characters, the Eels and the Mastodon. Ransome used to sail to Hamford Water, an area of tidal salt marshes and low-lying islands, in his yacht Nancy Blackett. He set the book here to offer his characters new opportunities to explore and make maps in a different landscape.  Plot summary  A map showing where Secret Water is set. Click to enlarge. The Swallows intend to sail in the Goblin (as featured in We Didn't Mean to Go to Sea) to Hamford Water and camp with their father, but he is called away on naval business. To compensate, he maroons them with a small dinghy on an island. Before he leaves, Father gives them an outline map of the area they decide to call Secret Water, and suggests they survey and chart the area before he returns to pick them up. For the first time, their small sister Bridget accompanies them on this adventure. Titty and Bridget then find some mysterious footprints, which they think look as though they were made by a Mastodon; when nobody else seems to have any interest, they return to their camp, where they find a totem pole of an eel. They spot somebody escaping in a dinghy, and they track the person to his lair; it turns out that the footprints had been left by a local boy named Donald, whom they nickname the \\"Mastodon\\", wearing \\"splatchers\\" (mud-shoes), and he left the totem pole because he mistook them for the Eels, another family who camp in the area regularly. For a surprise, Father has arranged for the Amazons to come down from the Lake District and join them with another dinghy, named the Firefly. The Amazons then suggest that everybody becomes \\"blood brothers\\", which, after Bridget pricks herself from hunting berries, they do successfully. They take the Mastodon as their native guide, and they chart several islands. Later, the Eels arrive, and are initially hostile - to the point of kidnapping Bridget - but when they discover that the protagonists are now blood brothers of the Eels, they settle down for a friendly war, culminating with feast of the Sacred Eel, complete with \\"human sacrifice\\". The \\"sacrifice\\" is Bridget, who very nearly does not arrive at her party, as a result of being trapped in the middle of a ford by a rising tide with Titty and Roger. The danger is genuine, since high tide level would have been well above their heads. Just before they have to swim for the shore, they are rescued by the Mastodon. It seems that due to the distractions of war and being cut off by the tides, the chart will not be completed. John is very disappointed about this, especially since the Swallows and Amazons have to leave the morning after the feast. However, early in the morning, two separate groups of children - Titty and Roger in their dinghy the Wizard, and the Amazons in Firefly - complete it.

Alanguilan, Jr. (20 January 1968 ‚Äì 21 December 2019), also known in the Philippines by his alias Komikero, was a Filipino comic book artist, writer, and architect from San Pablo, Laguna. He was an important figure in the Philippine comics renaissance of the 1990s and early 2000s, and is known internationally for his graphic novels Wasted and Elmer, and for his inking on American superhero comics such as Wetworks, X-Men, Superman: Birthright, Wolverine, and Fantastic Four. Many of Alanguilan's titles take place in the Philippines or feature Filipino characters, such as Elmer, Johnny Balbona, Humanis Rex!, and Timawa. He incorporated elements of social commentary in his work, especially Elmer, which satirizes racism. The protagonist of Whilce Portacio and Brian Haberlin's comic series Stone, Gerry Alan, is named for him.  Early life and education  = Childhood in San Pablo = Gerry Alanguilan was born in the city of San Pablo, Laguna in the Philippines. According to family lore, their surname was originally San Gabriel and they trace their origins to the barrio/barangay of Sta. Catalina, now part of San Pablo City and known as \\"Sandig\\" before the Spanish conquest. Their surname was changed supposedly because a witch placed a curse that would make them destitute for seven generations. Alanguilan would later use this tale as the basis for his story San Dig 1944 in the Siglo: Freedom anthology. The word \\"alanguilan\\" is itself is the tagalog name of Cananga odorata, a flowering tree now better known by the Spanish variant of its name, \\"Ylang- ylang.\\" As a child, he owned a chicken named Solano, which would later become the inspiration for his graphic novel Elmer. = Education = Alanguilan entered the University of Santo Tomas in 1984, earning a Bachelor of Science in Architecture from the College of Architecture and Fine Arts in 1989 and passing the board exams to become a Licensed Architect by 1990. = Creative influences = Alanguilan has cited Barry Windsor-Smith, Alfredo Alcala, Frank Miller, Katsuhiro Otomo and Alan Moore as creative influences, in particular Moore's 1980s reinterpretation of Marvelman.  Comics career  =Early Submissions= Alanguilan first submissions to Marvel Comics around 1986, while he was still in school. While these early submissions were met with rejections, Alanguilan was nevertheless encouraged by the fact that the rejection letters showed that at the very least, the executives at Marvel knew him and his work. This early period of sending submissions and receiving rejection letters lasted about seven years, during which Alanguilan sent submissions both to Marvel and to DC Comics. Alanguilan temporarily gave up on comics from 1993 to 1994. In his own blogpost, as reported by GMA News Online's Victor Rosero, he recounted:\\"From 1993 to 1994 I never drew anything. I went back to Architecture and worked as a draftsman and construction supervisor. I thought comics and I were done. But if comics is in your blood there‚Äôs no discouragement strong enough to keep you from drawing. And I eventually went back.‚Äù = Wasted = Alanguilan studied to become an architect, but turned his hobby of comic book illustration into a career to be with his then-girlfriend. At first, much of Alanguilan's work in comics was on conventional American superhero titles. His first self-written comic was Wasted, originally intended for only his friends to read, and was later embarrassed by the large amounts of violence and profanity in it. He published Wasted in the Philippines from July 1994 through July 1996, and from there its popularity spread to the United States, where it was praised by Warren Ellis, and established him as an independent comics creator. = Work with Image, Marvel, and DC = In the mid-1990s, Alanguilan began to be known as an inker for American comic book titles like Wetworks, X-Men, Superman: Birthright, Wolverine, High Roads, Fantastic Four, and Silent Dragon, sometimes working alongside fellow Filipino comic book creators Leinil Francis Yu and Whilce Portacio. His first break in a major US comics publishing house was with Image Comics, for whose Wildstorm imprint he began inking several titles ‚Äì including Wetworks, Hazard, and Grifter ‚Äì in 1996. Alanguilan then got his first opportunity to work for Marvel Comics in 1997, inking Leinil Francis Yu's pencils on Wolverine Volume 2 No. 121, written by Warren Ellis. Alanguilan's first work for DC Comics was when he inked Superman: Birthright, whose first issue came out in September 2003, with Mark Waid and Leinil Yu. After a long sabbatical from mainstream comics, Alanguilan, partnered again with Leinil Yu in 2012 on the art for Mark Millar's Supercrooks. = Elmer = In 2006, Alanguilan self-published a four-issue miniseries titled \\"Elmer,\\" depicting a world in which chickens suddenly gain intelligence and the ability to speak like humans. It was collected and released as a trade paperback in 2009. In 2010, it was published in France by Editions Ca Et La and North America by Slave Labor Graphics. It eventually won the French ACBD Prix Asie (Asia Prize for Criticism) Award and the Prix Quai des Bulles Award in 2011. It was also nominated for the 2011 Best New Graphic Album Eisner Award.Rumpus, Ron (18 July 2011), \\"RonReads Interview: Gerry Alanguilan,\\" Ron Reads.

English translation In 2020, It was listed 100 in the top 100 of the best graphic novel of the XXIst century by The Angouleme BD Festival. = TIMAWA = From 2007 to 2009, Alanguilan's adventure graphic novel TIMAWA was serialized in Buzz Magazine, earning a nomination as 2009 comic book series of the year at the 2009 Komikon Awards. = Darna Lives! = In 2011 Alanguilan partnered with Arnold Arre to write a 9-page concept piece called \\"Darna Lives!\\", which reimagined the life of the iconic Philippine Komiks character Darna. Alanguilan wrote the story and Arre providing the art for the piece, which portrayed Darna's alter-ego Narda having forgotten her superhero identity and moved on to a life of obscurity and poverty, until fate intervenes to bring back. Although short, it was notable for its significantly different portrayal of the character, since it was the first time the Narda alter-ego was portrayed as anything but a demure young woman. Commenting on the work in a Philippine Daily Inquirer interview, Alanguilan explained his motivations for coming out with the story: ‚ÄúI think Arnold and I were able to show that Darna, as a character, can stand to be interpreted differently to allow her to remain appealing and relevant to a new audience. I hope ‚ÄúDarna Lives‚Äù can push for this kind of change. I think Filipinos, as we have seen, are open too it, and comics creators and filmmakers do not need to keep relying on old tricks and gimmicks that have worked before. I hope it can push our storytellers in other media, especially TV and movies to be bolder. ‚ÄòDi mage-gets ng masa yan‚Äô ('The masses won't understand that') is a stupid, cowardly statement that ensures nothing but stagnancy.‚Äù = Rodski Patotski = In 2014, Alanguilan collaborated with Arnold Arre again to release the graphic novel Rodski Patotski: Ang Dalagang Baby.https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/lifestyle- features/2014/04/14/1312568/rodski-patotski-level-60 Written by Alanguilan and illustrated by Arre, the Philippines' National Book Development Board awarded Rodski Patotskiwith that year's National Book Award under the category of Best Book of Graphic Literature in English.http://booksphilippines.gov.ph/rodski- patotski-ang-dalagang-baby/ = Bakokak = In 2017, Alanguilan and Kevin Ray Valentino published \\"Bakokak,\\" a 92-page graphic novel in which a giant frog, mutated by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan, arrives and threatens the Philippines. Alanguilan wrote the story, and did the inks and colors for the cover. = Other Works = Alanguilan also created several other titles which were published in various Filipino publications, such as Johnny Balbona for Mango Comics' humor publication \\"Mwahaha\\", and Humanis Rex! in Fudge Magazine. He collaborated with architect Arlan Esme√±a to publish the graphic novel Where Bold Stars go to Die.https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/artandculture/181118/gerry- alanguilan-romanticizes-dead-bold- stars/story/http://varsitarian.net/news/20101028/tales_of_cancer He also contributed to local landmark anthologies Siglo: Freedom, Siglo: Passion and Filipino Komiks. In 2007, he created an autobiographical slice-of-life webcomic called Crest Hut Butt Shop, based on an earlier minicomic of the same name. = Critical and industry reception = His self-created titles attracted fans including comic creators Neil Gaiman and Warren Ellis.  Komiks advocacy  Alanguilan worked hard to promote Komiks as an art form appreciated by Filipinos, notably playing an important part in re- familiarizing the public with the work of Francisco Coching, leading to Coching's posthumous elevation to National Artist of the Philippines in 2014. He was also one of the leading voices in the protest against the conferment of the award to Carlo J. Caparas in 2009, which was finally voided by the Philippine Supreme court in 2013.  Komikero Artists Group  In 2002, Alanguilan organized an informal group of artists based in Laguna Province to create the Laguna Artists Group, which was soon renamed as the Komikero Artists Group. This group began simply as a group that would meet on the shores of Sampaloc lake to discuss komiks, but would later organize the San Pablo City Comics Festivals, which became a precursor of many later comics conventions in the Philippines. The influential group include Jonas Diego and Johnny Danganan, who would later serve as the visual inspiration for the titular character in Alanguilan's Johnny Balbona. = San Pablo City Comics Festivals = In 2003, the Komikero Artists Group organized the San Pablo City Comics Festival, at the Mari√±o Residence along Sampalok Lake in San Pablo City, with the aim of showcasing original komiks art works past and present. Alanguilan noted that \\"mini-comics conventions\\" had been happening in the Philippines as early as 1994. But the San Pablo City Comics Festival marked the first time such a convention happened outside Manila. It also became the precursor to the annual Komikon Comics Convention, which had its first run in the Bahay ng Alumni in UP Diliman a year later, in 2004. Alanguilan played an active role in organizing the second San Pablo City Comics Festival, which took place at the San Pablo City Lion's Club along Sampalok Lake in 2009. The third run of the festival saw the Komikero Artists Group collaborating with the UPLB Graphic Literature Guild and holding the festival at the Ultimart Shopping Center, which is at the center of San Pablo City. The Fourth San Pablo City Comics Festival was held on 20 January 2019 ‚Äì less than a year before Alanguilan died.  Komikero Komiks Museum  In 2016, Alanguilan founded the Komikero Komiks Museum, a brick-and-mortar museum in his hometown of San Pablo City, which he said was meant \\"to show our countrymen our rich history in the medium as well as to showcase the talent that we have.\\" It featured original art from early Philippine comic book industry leaders including Alfredo Alcala, Francisco Coching, Alex Ni√±o, Steve Gan, Nestor Redondo, Tony Velasquez, and Hal Santiago. Alanguilan curated the museum until his death in 2019.  \\"Hey, Baby\\" meme  In 2009, he made a one-minute video titled \\"Hey, Baby\\", which consists mainly of him making comically lecherous facial expressions at his webcam. This video became popular on YouTube, and was featured on 25 January 2011 episode of American television show Tosh.0. Clips from the video were used in several episodes of Russell Howard's Good News, often in response to the host asking questions like \\"What kind of creepy weirdo would come up with that?\\" In October 2010, Alanguilan was declared \\"The Greatest Man on the Internet\\" by video blogger Ray William Johnson. His creepy smiling face was also a popular meme in Indonesia, known as Ayo sini sama om (\\"come here to uncle\\"), usually used for comedic effect combined with other memes. As of 2019, the video had been viewed over 6 million times. Other works Alanguilan played the role of a human trafficker in Tin-tin,15, a short film created in 2010 to increase awareness of child trafficking in the Philippines.  Death  Alanguilan died on 21 December 2019, at the age of 51 in San Pablo, Laguna, Philippines. In the weeks leading up to his death, he wrote posts on his blog about his struggles with participating in conventions and living with disability. Despite this, he continued to work on his comics until his death.  Legacy  Alanguilan is considered a vanguard of what has been called the \\"new wave\\" or \\"renaissance\\" of Philippine comics in the 1990s and 2000s.https://downthetubes.net/?p=12923 By that time, Philippine publishing industry had gone into decline, resulting in Philippine-made comic books disappearing from newsstands. But the rise of independent publications like Alanguilan's \\"Wasted\\" eventually gave rise to a growing culture of \\"indie\\" comics.

They were built by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. from 1926 to 1928 to provide housing for African Americans, and was the first large cooperative aimed at that demographic. The buildings were designed by architect Andrew J. Thomas and were named in honor of the noted African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The complex consists of six separate buildings with a total of 511 apartments (as constructed) and occupies an entire city block. The buildings center around an interior garden courtyard, with each building \\"U\\"-shaped so that every apartment receives easy air flow and direct sunlight at some point during the day. The Dunbar is considered the \\"first large garden-complex in Manhattan.\\" The complex was designated a New York City Landmark in 1970, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History and description An entranceway seen from the courtyard The Dunbar Apartments were constructed as an experiment in housing reform, to alleviate the housing shortage in Harlem and to provide housing for African Americans. Rather than being set up as rental apartments, the complex was a housing cooperative. Tenants were required to pay a down payment of $50 per room, and then $14.50 per room per month, much of which went towards a mortgage on the space. In 22 years, if payments were all made on time, the tenant would own the apartment. The project was both the first large cooperative aimed at African Americans, and also New York City's first large garden apartment complex.New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. \\"Dunbar Apartments Designation Report\\" (July 14, 1970) The original tenants were primarily middle class, and inexpensive childcare was provided on-site to support working mothers. However, the building opened in 1928, and the Great Depression began just a year later. The management of the complex was forced to loosen a number of cooperative rules in order to allow people to, for example, take in lodgers. Even so, too many tenants failed to make their payments and the buildings defaulted on their mortgage to Rockefeller. He foreclosed in 1936, and a year later the buildings were converted to rental units. In June 2013, the Dunbar Apartments were sold to the Brooklyn-based developer E&M; Associates. Plans were set in motion to upgrade the facilities and establish the Dunbar as one of the premier upscale complexes in Upper Manhattan. These plans include renovating the vacant apartments, updating and refurbishing the interior courtyard and garden, and the addition of a variety of amenities including a fitness center, playground, additional security and a doorman. The contract was acquired by Samuel Berry and Andrew Melohn of Douglas Elliman working in conjunction with Fredrik Eklund. A crest over an entranceway on Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Boulevard Notable residents Noted personalities to live in the Dunbar Apartments include leaders of the Civil Rights Movement such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Noah D. Thompson, and A. Philip Randolph, entertainer Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, poet Countee Cullen, and the explorer Matthew Henson.

Its motto was 'By Hammer and Hand'. It began as a loose part of the Birmingham Kyrle Society, then became a more fully formed group within the Kyrle Society in 1890, under the leadership of the silversmith and architect Arthur Stansfield Dixon (1856‚Äì1929) and with the lawyer Montague Fordham as first director, in Vittoria Street School for jewellers and silversmiths. In 1895, the Guild set up as an independent workshop and limited company with the guidance of Edward R. Taylor, who was an important figure in the history of Birmingham School of Art. William Kenrick, the local MP and an Arts and Crafts enthusiast, became a director. The Guild's first address was at Kyrle Hall, Sheep Street, the same studios later being taken over by John Paul Cooper. In 1898, the Guild moved to 44-5 Great Charles Street. The Guild produced furniture and metalware, taking special advantage of the switch to electric lighting and the consequent need for new light fittings. Arthur Dixon was the chief designer and head of metalwork workshop. Other members were Albert Edward Jones and Thomas Birkett. Bernard Sleigh was a teacher at the Guild. The Guild also produced fine books under the 'Press of the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft, Limited' and a periodical titled The Quest. The Quest began in November 1894 and aimed to appear three times a year, but was short-lived. William Morris was a contributor. Those involved with the Press were Ernest Treglown, Arthur Gaskin, and Charles March Gere. Charles Carr and Mary Newill were book illustrators for the Guild. The Press was still active in 1919, when it published Memorials: The Work of the Architect and Craftsman in the Design and Execution of War Memorials. The Guild ran a London showroom, headed by Martin Muir, at 7 Newman Street, Oxford Square. The Guild was modelled on Charles Robert Ashbee's 1888 Guild and School of Handicraft, and it found itself in similar financial difficulties due to high running costs and lack of money- making ventures. Due to commercial pressures, there was a merger with E & R Gittins in 1905, which brought Llewelyn Roberts in to the organisation. In 1919, there was a further merger with Hart, Son & Pearl. The name was still shown until 1950 in directories as \\"The Birmingham Guild Ltd., Architectural & Decorative Metalworkers\\", the addresses being Grosvenor Road West and Sherbourne St. B16.

Ted Turner ‚Äì who had purchased WJRJ-TV (channel 17) in January 1970 (changing its call letters to WTCG shortly after the sale was finalized), when the station was simply a UHF independent station available primarily within the Atlanta market ‚Äì shocked Atlanta media observers by acquiring the rights to Braves games after the 1972 season, taking them from NBC affiliate WSB-TV (channel 2, now an ABC affiliate), which had carried the team's games since the Braves moved to Atlanta from Milwaukee in 1966 (however, WSB-TV's sister radio station, WSB (AM), continued to hold rights to radio broadcasts of the games for years afterward). The acquisition of television rights to the Braves was particularly striking given that WTCG had experienced major profit losses ever since Turner took over the station; channel 17's revenue was only then starting to break even and the station became more competitive among the Atlanta market's television outlets ratings-wise. Braves games began airing on WTCG during the 1973 season. Even more astonishing, a few years later, Turner would buy the team outright before the 1976 season, mainly to keep a programming staple of his in Atlanta. Before the purchase, rumors had spread alleging that the Braves' owners were looking to move the franchise to another city, following dismal stadium attendance during the 1974 and 1975 seasons, after the excitement of Hank Aaron hitting his then-record-breaking 715th home run (on April 8, 1974) wore off. During the 1970s, Turner syndicated live games to stations (mostly major network affiliates, as the region had few independent stations) throughout Georgia and adjoining states, including Turner-owned WRET (now WCNC-TV) in Charlotte, North Carolina, as WSB-TV had previously done. Usually, the Sunday afternoon game and one game that aired during prime time were provided to these stations, with mid-week game telecasts airing mainly during the summer, when the major networks were airing reruns, a normal practice among the other MLB teams during that era. Also by the mid-1970s, WTCG had already become available on many cable systems in Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina via microwave relay transmission by the mid-1970s, giving the team even further television exposure to its loyal fanbase in the South. A landmark event for WTCG occurred on December 17, 1976, when Turner uplinked the station's signal to the Satcom 1 satellite for distribution to cable providers throughout the United States; as a result, Braves telecasts began airing nationally with the 1977 season. When WTCG reached a significant penetration of Southern U.S. households with cable television service around 1978-1979, Turner discontinued syndicating the team's game broadcasts, making the Braves the first team not to provide live coverage of its games to broadcast television stations outside of those within the team's home market. Turner once famously tried to get Andy Messersmith to use his #17 jersey to promote Superstation WTBS during its early years; the back of the jersey read, \\"CHANNEL 17.\\" Major League Baseball immediately stopped this plan as, according to MLB rules, team jerseys are not allowed to incorporate advertisements other than that of the jersey's manufacturer. =1980s and early 1990s= During the 1980s and 1990s, the Braves game telecasts on TBS received high ratings, usually garnering around a 2.0 or sometimes an even higher ratings share. Around this time, the station referred to the franchise as \\"America's team\\" in a promotional campaign. WTBS petitioned for the rights to produce a locally originated broadcast of the 1982 National League Championship Series, in which the Braves played against the St. Louis Cardinals. Following a decision from the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, Major League Baseball blocked it from carrying the series on the grounds that as a cable superstation, TBS could not have the rights to a national telecast that competed with network coverage of the NLCS, which was carried that year by ABC. After the 1983 season, Major League Baseball no longer permitted local television stations to produce their own League Championship Series broadcasts (a point made moot by the fact that the games were already available over-the-air). In 1997, TBS began to collect subscriber fees directly from cable providers, effectively resulting in the national feed operating under the conventions of a conventional basic cable network, though it still technically was designated as a superstation. In exchange, TBS began to lease advertising slots to providers to carry local commercial inserts; as a result, the TBS superstation feed began to televise fewer regular season Atlanta Braves games to a national audience.Turner Superstation to Collect Cable TV Fees, The New York Times, August 1, 1997. =2000s= 2003 In 2003, the Braves telecasts on TBS underwent significant changes for the first time in many years. Don Sutton and Joe Simpson assumed duties as lead commentators, while longtime play-by-play announcers Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren had their roles on the broadcasts reduced. The telecasts were also rebranded from Braves Baseball on TBS to Major League Baseball on TBS (before reverting to the previous title the following year). These changes reflected an increase in the network's rights fee payments to Major League Baseball. In turn, national sponsors could fulfill their advertising commitments by purchasing ads on TBS, in addition to ESPN or Fox. The move was strongly criticized by Braves fans, Atlanta area media outlets and team manager Bobby Cox. Over 90% of Braves fans who voted in an online poll conducted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper preferred the team of Caray and Van Wieren to the more neutral broadcasts. The move backfired, and ratings for the TBS broadcasts declined sharply. After that year's All-Star break, TBS brought back Caray and Van Wieren to work with the two analysts. Braves TBS Xtra Beginning in 2004, some TBS telecasts (mostly those airing on Fridays or Saturdays) became more enhanced. The network branded its interactive telecasts as Braves TBS Xtra, which Braves broadcaster Skip Caray would refer to simply as \\"one of those super duper telecasts\\". Enhancements featured in the broadcasts included a catcher cam, Xtra Motion showing the type of pitch and its movement, and the leadOff Line. Often, a guest analyst would join the main announcers in the broadcast booth; telecasts also featured inside access to players including discussions between players and coaching staff while the game was ongoing. 2006 While just carrying 70 Braves games on TBS, the Turner Broadcasting System sold Turner South to Fox Sports, and allowed them keep the games (Turner South had been carrying Braves games in order to ensure that the channel would receive wide distribution in the Southeastern U.S.). Afterwards, Braves game presentations on Turner South (which was rebranded as SportSouth later that year to distinguish it from its new sister network) and FSN South adopted a uniform on-air appearance and began using the same announcers. FSN South's 25-game package (with telecasts usually airing on Wednesdays) is a vestige of its days as the former SportSouth (which was launched by Turner in the early 1990s), as well as a means to ensure that ESPN's game broadcasts would generally be the only one televised nationwide on Wednesdays without requiring a subscription to the MLB Extra Innings out-of-market sports package. As a result of Turner's decision to allow FSN to broadcast over 85 games per season, TBS no longer served as the Braves' primary broadcaster. Coupled with the impending sale of the team, Pete Van Wieren stated, \\"It's like an end of an era.\\" At the end of the 2006 season, Turner Sports decided not to renew analyst Don Sutton's contract with the network, while Ron Gant joined FSN South/SportSouth on a full-time basis; as a result, Joe Simpson would be the main analyst for all Braves telecasts. =High definition= During the 2006 season, all Braves home games airing on TBS began to be broadcast in high definition over the digital signal of WTBS within the Atlanta and on cable providers throughout the Southeastern U.S. (such as Comcast and Charter Communications). The cable deals were not renewed as none of the TBS home games were broadcast in HD during the 2007 season (all home games airing on FSN South/SportSouth were presented in HD on both cable and satellite). However, TBS's assumption of rights to a national MLB television package resulted in the creation of a dedicated HD feed for the national version. 2007 and beyond The 2007 season marked the last year that Braves baseball games aired on TBS over a fully national feed,TBS truly goes national with national pastime, leaving Braves behind covering 70 Braves games as in recent years. From 2008 to 2013, WPCH-TV ‚Äì the former originating feed of TBS, which was rebranded as \\"Peachtree TV\\" as part of the October 2007 separation of the Atlanta station and its superstation feed ‚Äì ran 45 Braves games per season in the Atlanta market, which were available for broadcast in the Braves regional territory and on regional sports network Comcast/Charter Sports Southeast. The remaining games aired on FSN South or SportSouth, meaning the Braves telecasts reverted to primarily regional coverage, as most other teams have done ever since recent expansions gave MLB a virtually nationwide footprint. However, due to licensing requirements set by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that prevented the national cable feed of TBS to be carried in Canada (as only the local Atlanta feed was designated as an eligible-for-carriage superstation), WPCH remains available on Canadian cable and satellite providers as a designated superstation, allowing Braves games aired by WPCH to continue to be seen outside of the Atlanta area. This move left WGN America ‚Äì the national feed of Chicago-based WGN-TV ‚Äì as the only superstation to broadcast games from local sports teams to a national audience. TBS had previously announced a broadcast rights agreement to air those same 45 games nationally, before it signed a new contract to air Sunday afternoon regular season and postseason games nationally one year earlier in June 2006, an announcement that was made during the 2006 MLB All-Star Game. A limited number of these nationally televised games have included the Braves ‚Äì which have appeared on a few of the game telecasts since 2008. After 32 years, the final Braves baseball telecast on TBSEnd of an era for TBS, Braves, fans aired on September 30, 2007, in which the Braves lost in an away game against the Houston Astros, 3‚Äì0. During the final broadcast, play-by-play announcer Skip Caray thanked fans saying, \\"To all you people who have watched the Braves for these 30 years ... thank you. We appreciate you more than you will ever know. ... Thank you folks and God bless you. And we're going to miss you every bit as much as you miss us.\\" Braves games continued to air locally within the Atlanta market until 2013, when Fox Sports South ‚Äì which had been producing the games for WPCH since the station's operations were turned over to the Meredith Corporation, owner of Atlanta's CBS affiliate WGCL-TV (channel 46), under a local marketing agreement in 2011 ‚Äì acquired the regional television rights to the station's 45-game package beginning with the 2014 season, ending WPCH's relationship with the Braves after 40 years.

This blackout rule was somewhat less restrictive than that for ESPN, which covers the entirety of a team's designated market area.

WGFN is based out of Glen Arbor, Michigan, airing at 98.1 FM to the Traverse City market. WGFN has been the flagship station of the Bear network of classic rock stations that have aired in Northern Michigan since the early 2000s, which peaked with 4 regional stations from 2002-2009 and 2010-2012. The only other surviving Bear station in the region is 95.3 WWSS, which airs the same programming and playlist as WGFN, but features differing station identifications and commercial content for its market. The Bear aired the popular syndicated morning radio program The Bob & Tom Show until September 2017, and currently airs Detroit Tigers baseball games and Detroit Lions football games. The current lineup includes Smitty in morning drive, \\"California Girl\\" Nicole Pence in mid-days, and Jay Roberts on afternoon drive. Until 2009, WGFN was joined by 97.9 WIHC in Newberry, 105.1 WGFM in Cheboygan, and 107.1 WCKC in Cadillac in Northern Star Broadcasting's then-Classic Rock: The Bear network. WGFM became a partial simulcast of Glen Arbor mainstream rock station WJZJ in September 2009, and continues to broadcast the format under the Rock 105 branding. In February 2010, WIHC was taken dark by Northern Star in the wake of their sale of most Upper Peninsula radio stations to Sovereign Communications, before being sold to new owners and relaunched as the religious simulcast Strong Tower Radio in 2012. Fellow Upper Peninsula stations WUPK & WIMK (which shared the Classic Rock: The Bear branding but were otherwise not linked) were also sold to Sovereign Communications in 2010. Northern Star replenished the four station Bear network in 2010 by converting two then-country stations into Bear affiliates, replacing WGFM with 94.5 WLJZ (later WOEZ) in Mackinaw City, and adding 93.9 WAVC in Mio to the network, but both stations were transferred to Michigan Broadcasters in separate deals in 2012 & 2013 to become Your Patriot Voice talk radio stations, with WCHY (formerly WQEZ) changing formats in 2013 to effectively replace WLJZ in the Mackinaw City region. WCKC in Cadillac was ultimately sold to Up North Media in 2016 and re-imaged as 107.1 The Drive during Northern Star Broadcasting's sale of their remaining radio stations, though it retains a classic rock format. On March 12, 2018, Black Diamond Broadcasting traded WCHY for Darby Advertising's WWSS (95.3 FM), which currently airs the classic rock format. Accessed March 14, 2018 Beginnings: W-Gold FM In 1989, longtime northern Michigan radio personality and engineer Del Reynolds and wife Mary purchased 100,000 watt CHR WQLZ (formerly WCBY-FM) in Cheboygan. Shortly afterward, he changed the station's format to classic rock with the WGFM call letters, meaning \\"W-Gold-FM\\". The station's original format was an oldies/classic rock mix, and also played new cuts from classic rock artists as well. The station was live/local 6 a.m. until 6 p.m. and aired Westwood One's Adult Rock format overnights. Del was the station's morning man. In 1992, WGFM/WGFN flipped to the current classic rock format, after competing station WAIR was doing better with the oldies format. Throughout the 1990s, Del's radio empire grew when he acquired many other local stations and built new ones as well. He purchased WIDG 940 in St. Ignace, MI and WCBY AM in Cheboygan the station that launched his career in the late 1960s. In 1992, he purchased 98.1 WMLB Glen Arbor, which had previously simulcast WUPS in Houghton Lake, and changed that to WGFN, giving WGFM a clearer signal in the Traverse City, MI area. He also took over 107.1 WCKC \\"Cadillac KC Country\\" Cadillac which was simulcasting his 102.9 WMKC \\"KC Country\\" St. Ignace, MI, but eventually changing to a WGFM simulcast in 1996. The Bear debuts In 1998, Reynolds sold his stations to Calibre Communications for $7 million. As a result, the station would remain classic rock, but under a new moniker, The Bear, and Reynolds would leave the morning show host position. When Calibre asked Reynolds who should replace him, he suggested Bob and Tom. It was a wise decision on the station's part since they would pry album-oriented rock (AOR) stalwart WKLT from the Arbitron #2 spot all the way down to #5, while in many books, The Bear is in the top five. Bob and Tom - whose radio career started at WJML in the late 1970s - are now one of the most-popular morning shows in northern Michigan. Also, WGFN was made the flagship of The Bear stations, even though most of their operations are in Cheboygan, partially due to Traverse City being the biggest city in northern Michigan. Unfortunately, the deal between Calibre and Reynolds failed, though a new company, Northern Star Broadcast Holdings, LLC., was formed to take over Reynolds' stations. Although no longer owner, Reynolds remained as the station's engineer.

However, when Great Aunt Maria finds out that the Blackett girls have been left at home, she decides to come and take care of them. She is unaware of the Ds' visit. Nancy Blackett insists that the Ds' holiday will not be spoiled and that they will learn to sail the Scarab, a dinghy their father has bought for them.

True to her character, Dorothea constantly romanticises their situation. The Great Aunt attempts to civilize the Amazon pirates, for example by making them read aloud, recite poetry and perform their party-pieces on the piano. Despite these ordeals, they manage to accomplish a number of adventures. They succeed in escaping for a day to accompany Captain Flint's partner Timothy to the copper-mine previously discovered in Pigeon Post. The Ds succeed in burgling Captain Flint's study at Beckfoot to commandeer some chemical equipment that Timothy needs. They are also introduced to sailing the Scarab. The Great Aunt in fact suspects that the Amazons are meeting the Swallows. Near the end of her visit, the Great Aunt goes missing and there is a hue and cry and search for her.

The caves are named after the nearby Marble Arch, a natural limestone arch at the upstream end of Cladagh Glen under which the Cladagh River flows. The caves are formed from three rivers draining off the northern slopes of Cuilcagh mountain, which combine underground to form the Cladagh. On the surface, the river emerges from the largest karst resurgence in Ireland, and one of the largest in the United Kingdom. At the Marble Arch Caves form the longest known cave system in Northern Ireland, and the karst is considered to be among the finest in the British Isles.  History  =18th‚Äì19th century: The Junction, Grand Gallery and Pool Chamber= Drawing by √â. A. Martel, depicting the first exploration of Marble Arch Caves in 1895. The Marble Arch, Cladagh River resurgence and three large dolines on the plateau above the end of Cladagh Glen were all known well before underground exploration began; in fact the arch was a popular tourist attraction in the 19th century. As early as the 1730s, the Reverend William Henry described these features, as well as the sinks of the Owenbrean, Aghinrawn and Sruh Croppa rivers which he correctly surmised to be feeders of the system. cited in Without venturing far into the cave, Henry descended to the base of one of the dolines above the resurgence: The stream passages at the base of each shakehole were first explored by √âdouard-Alfred Martel and Dublin naturalist Lyster Jameson in 1895. Using a canvas boat, and with candles and magnesium flares for light, Martel and Jameson found of passages, including the junction where the three rivers (the Owenbrean and the combined Aghinrawn and Sruh Croppa) meet. They drew a map of the discoveries and line drawings depicting the expedition, noting the upstream conclusion by boat in the Grand Gallery, and on foot at Pool Chamber. Today, this route to Pool Chamber forms part of the walking section of the show cave. Today, visitors disembark at the same place that Jameson and Martel first made landfall. Martel and Jameson also investigated Cradle Hole, a very large surface shakehole south-south-west of Marble Arch. A cave entrance in the north-eastern corner‚ÄîLower Cradle‚Äîwas explored, reaching an underground river and passages with the same proportions as those in the Marble Arch Cave. =1907‚Äì1908: Great Boulder Chamber and dye tracing= alt=Hand-drawn map of a cave, showing meandering underground river passage as well as surface topography including large shakeholes. In 1907, English cavers from the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club began exploration in the area, and without access to a boat they decided to wade the section of underground river as far as The Junction, subsequently reaching the extent of Martel and Jameson's explorations. Bolstered by the experience, and the good possibility of further discoveries, the Yorkshire Ramblers returned in Easter 1908. A group of cavers descended a pothole located close to the large dolines on the plateau and discovered the Great Boulder Chamber. After a few hours of exploring, they realised that they had found a new route into Pool Chamber, bypassing the deep water of the original entrance. During the 1908 explorations, the Yorkshire Ramblers conducted tests to ascertain the hydrological connections between caves. They performed a dye tracing experiment with fluorescein, establishing a direct hydrological connection from the Aghinrawn River sink at Monastir cliff, via Upper Cradle Hole Cave (situated on the south side of Cradle Hole), to the Cladagh Glen resurgence. While surveying Lower Cradle Hole Cave, one caver sent a floating candle downstream along the river, until it floated under a low ceiling out of sight at the end of the known passage. On plotting the surveyed passage on a map alongside Marble Arch Cave, it was apparent that only separated the end of this passage from the upstream end of the Grand Gallery, and it was postulated that a connection between the two might be forged. =1935‚Äì1938: Skreen Hill and connections= No further exploration was made until Easter 1935 when another group from the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club made their way from England. In wet conditions, the cavers re-entered Pool Chamber via the entrance found in 1908, and after some investigation discovered a high-level crawling passage exiting the chamber. The passage ended high in the wall of New Chamber, a cavern of considerable size, where the upstream continuation of the river was found. Exploration was halted here as the water was too deep to pass. The club returned to New Chamber in 1936 to explore and survey the ongoing Skreen Hill passage, named after the hill on the surface above. After of walking passage, the cavers stopped at a deep lake. This section of deep water is where the path of the current show cave ends. When club members returned again in 1938 they brought an inflatable dinghy, allowing them to progress across the lake, only to discover that the way on was blocked by Sump 1, just from the shore. During the 1935 expedition another group of cavers explored Lower Cradle Hole Cave. On reaching the downstream end of the cave, they discovered that water levels were now low enough to see a series of low arches above the water surface. By anchoring a floating candle part-way through the passage, exiting the cave and returning to the end of the Grand Gallery in Marble Arch Cave, the cavers confirmed that the passages were connected; subsequently, two of the party swam through to make the first through-trip between Marble Arch Cave and Lower Cradle Hole Cave. =1966‚Äì1967: Skreen Hill 2, 3 and Legnabrocky Way= One of the traditional entrances to the underground Cladagh River: now an entrance to the show cave by boat. By the mid-1960s a number of advancements had been made in cave diving, by which method speleologists had extended their explorations into caves beyond the sumps that would normally have halted progress. In December 1966 divers Dave Cobley and Mike Boon made preparations to dive Sump 1 in Skreen Hill passage. Before making the dive however, they investigated a small dry passage leading off on the left bank of the lake, finding it to be blocked at the end by unstable boulders in the roof. The cavers removed one of the boulders to reveal a way on, which led via a dry route to the far side of Sump 1. The new section of river passage beyond was named Skreen Hill 2, and a further inlet passage was named Legnabrocky Way. A notable feature of the Legnabrocky Way is the Giant's Hall, a large chamber 60 m long, 30 m high and 15 m wide (200√ó98√ó49 ft). Despite only carrying a small stream, the Legnabrocky Way is the largest section of passage in Marble Arch Cave. The upstream continuation of the river in Skreen Hill 2 was found to be shortly blocked by Sump 3, so in March 1967 a team of divers returned to attempt further exploration. William Frakes and John Ogden were the first to successfully pass the sump to reach Skreen Hill 3, of \\"magnificent stream passage\\" ending in boulder choke. In the ensuing months a comprehensive survey was made of all of Marble Arch Caves, including the newly discovered sections. During this time, surveyors learned of the deaths of Frakes, Ogden and Colin Vickers‚Äîanother of the divers in the original team‚Äîin the Mossdale Caverns accident. In tribute, a number of cave features in Skreen Hill 3 were named after the three cavers. =1982‚Äì1985: show cave development= From 1982 until after opening in 1985, sections of Marble Arch Cave underwent development to improve accessibility in order to accept tourist visitors. As well as concrete pathways, safety barriers and electric lighting, this involved installing weirs and jetties for boat access to enable visitors to enter the caves by the same route that Martel and the early explorers took. The man-made show cave exit also serves as an entrance during times when boats are not in use. The development also included boring a new entrance shaft into Skreen Hill and, significantly, blasting a corridor through the short section of rock separating Pool Chamber from New Chamber. This connected Skreen Hill all the way to The Junction for walking visitors for the first time. An elevated section of the walkway between New Chamber and Pool Chamber. At this time, all known entrances to the cave system were gated to allow show cave management to control access. From then on, cavers were only allowed access by agreement with the show cave. =1995: Cradle Hole tragedy= Three cavers died on a trip into Lower Cradle Hole on 15 January 1995. They were in a group of ten cavers, mostly students from University College Dublin and Dublin Institute of Technology caving clubs, when the three were swept away by fast running water and drowned in the low air-space (or \\"duck\\") section of passage between the end of Lower Cradle Hole and the Grand Gallery in Marble Arch Cave. Those killed were Philip Marshall (20), Brian Patrick Kennedy (22) and Conleth Cormican (21). =2009‚Äì2010: diving connections= In 2009 and 2010 diving connections were made to nearby cave systems by Artur Koz≈Çowski. Koz≈Çowski made the first connecting dive to Prod's Pot ‚Äì Cascades Rising, doubling the total length of the system from . Subsequently he and Chris Jewell connected the newly established Monastir Sink ‚Äì Upper Cradle system, extending the Marble Arch system to .Report from connection between Marble Arch and Upper Cradle 2010. Hell&High; Water The discoveries make this the longest cave in Northern Ireland. Hydrology and development The Marble Arch Cave system is chiefly formed from three rivers which drain off the Marlbank area on the north side of Cuilcagh mountain. From west to east, these tributaries are the Sruh Croppa, the Aghinrawn (or Monastir) and the Owenbrean. The Prod's Pot ‚Äì Cascades Rising section of the system (connected to Marble Arch Caves in 2009)Report from connection between Marble Arch and Prod's Pot/Cascades systems 2009. Hell&High; Water has a complex hydrology which includes drainage from at least five small sinks on the eastern Marlbank (Gortmaconnell Pot, Little Gortmaconnell Pot, Smokey Mountain Sink and two unnamed sinks at Brookfield have been dye traced to Cascades); sections of the Owenbrean River upstream of its main sink at Pollasumera; and most notably Goat Pot, Aghatirourke Pot, Pigeon Pots and Badger Pot on East Cuilcagh, nearly to the southeast. Of these, Goat Pot and Aghatirourke Pot have also been traced to Tullyhona Rising ( east-southeast from Cascades Rising); Pigeon Pots, Badger Pot and Aghatirourke Pot also flow to Gortalughany Rising (an overflow rising on East Cuilcagh); and Badger Pot and Pigeon Pots also flow to Shannon Pot on the far western slopes of Cuilcagh.  Show cave  A section of cave passage and walkway in the showcave. √âdouard-Alfred Martel first postulated that Marble Arch Cave would make a worthy show cave after initially exploring the system in 1895. However it was not until 1982 that work eventually began on creating a new underground tourist attraction. Development included: *Building concrete and metal walkways with handrails throughout the show cave; *Installation of electric lighting; *A new tunnel between Pool Chamber and New Chamber, providing walking access to Skreen Hill passageways; *An access shaft and staircase into Skreen Hill passage from one of the large surface dolines on the plateau; *A short section of walled pathway dug into the floor of the cave, under a low ceiling‚Äîthe \\"Moses Walk\\" is so-called because the river continues to run at shoulder level either side of the path; *A visitor centre, car park and access road on the surface. Covering a small section of the system, the Marble Arch Caves show cave was opened to the public on 29 May 1985. Visitors travel through the first part of the caves by boat on the subterranean Cladagh River, before walking through the rest of the chambers. At the \\"Moses Walk\\", the path sinks into the riverbed to pass a low-ceilinged section of passage. Between 1985 and 2008 the show cave attracted approximately 1 million visitors, from 100 countries worldwide. Annual visitor capacity (during the period that the cave is open, March‚ÄìSeptember) is 94,060.  European/Global Geopark status  In 2001, the caves and the nearby Cuilcagh Mountain Park joined to become a European Geopark under the name Marble Arch Caves European Geopark, the first park in the UK to be recognised by the European Geoparks Network (EGN). This allocation was due in part to the existence of the caves themselves and also the rare blanket bog which covers a vast area of the mountains. Under an agreement between the EGN and the UNESCO Earth Sciences division in 2004, the park became part of the Global Network of National Geoparks (GGN) scheme and was renamed Marble Arch Caves Global Geopark. In 2008 the park boundaries were extended across the border into parts of County Cavan in the Republic of Ireland, making it the first international Geopark in the world.  Conservation issues  A large stalactite, nicknamed \\"Martel's\\" by show cave staff, was damaged by vandals before the attraction opened. The cutting of turf has led to damage in the area. Extensive drainage in parts of the bog has damaged the bog's ability to retain water, resulting in flooding and abnormally high water levels in the caves downstream. This has impeded tourist activity in the past, notably in 1989 when the impact of such damage influencing cave water levels first became evident. As a protective measure, turf cutting has been banned within the wider Geopark. In addition more than 1200 small dams have been put in place across the bogland to slow water flow and encourage the growth of new bog. Another problem is that human interference can cause the limestone to be damaged or eroded. In a particular case in 1984, a group of vandals broke into the show cave before it was opened to the public and threw stones at some of the calcite formations around the entrance. Many small stalactites were snapped off at their bases, while the tip of the largest stalactite in the show cave (over in length) was broken off. This tip fell onto a sandbank on the cave floor where it was retrieved the next day by a workman. It was then sent to the Ulster Museum in Belfast where a calcite resin was specially produced and subsequently used to stick the tip back onto its original position.

Understanding by Design and UbD are registered trademarks of the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD). Backward design Understanding by Design relies on what Wiggins and McTighe call \\"backward design\\" (also known as \\"backwards planning\\"). Teachers, according to UbD proponents, traditionally start curriculum planning with activities and textbooks instead of identifying classroom learning goals and planning towards that goal. In backward design, the teacher starts with classroom outcomes and then plans the curriculum, choosing activities and materials that help determine student ability and foster student learning.Hammond, G. (nd) Multiple methods of assessment. Red River College. Retrieved 6/7/07. The backward design approach has three stages. Stage 1 is identification of desired results for students. This may use content standards, common core or state standards. Stage 1 defines \\"Students will understand that...\\" and lists essential questions that will guide the learner to understanding. Stage 2 is assessing learning strategies. Stage 3 is listing the learning activities that will lead students to your desired results. Teaching for understanding In their article on science education, Smith and Siegel argue \\"that education aims at the imparting of knowledge: students are educated in part so that they may come to know things\\".Smith, M., & Siegel, H. (2004). Knowing, Believing, and Understanding: What Goals for Science Education? Science & Education, 13(6), 553-582. doi:10.1023/B:SCED.0000042848.14208.bf While a student can know a lot about a particular subject, teachers globally are beginning to push their students to go beyond simple recall. This is where understanding plays an important role. The goal of Teaching for Understanding is to give students the tools to take what they know, and what they will eventually know, and make a mindful connection between the ideas.Wiggins, G., & McTighe, J. (2005). Understanding by Design (Expanded 2nd ed.). Alexandria, Virginia: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development. In a world that is filled with data, teachers are only able to help students learn a small number of ideas and facts. As such, it is important that we give students the tools needed to decipher and understand the ideas. This transferability of skills is at the heart of McTighe and Wiggins' technique. If a student is able to transfer the skills they learn in the classroom to unfamiliar situations, whether academic or non-academic, they are said to truly understand.Smith, M., & Siegel, H. (2004).

Hamilton has developed a detailed mythology. Her series is an alternate history that assumes that the supernatural is real, and that vampires, lycanthropes, and other supernatural beings live alongside humans in a society that otherwise resembles 21st century North America. Although the existence of supernatural beings has been public knowledge for centuries in the Anitaverse (see select references below), its history has otherwise unfolded so identically to that of the real world that the series contains occasional references to the popular culture of the 1990s, including the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the O.J. Simpson trial, and others. Undead =Vampires= There are many different types of vampires discussed in Anita Blake's mythology. Generally they are turned by being bitten three times on three subsequent nights. Draining of blood is part of the process, although not all of it as not everyone who is bitten becomes a vampire and the full requirements to go from being human to vampire are uncertain. Once turned the new vampire is then taught by their master on the rights, rituals and general rules of \\"living,\\" which includes a blood oath between the master and subservient vampire (read: does not necessarily require a newly turned individual). This generally in turn leads to the vampire hierarchy of master to Master of the City. These master vampires in turn owe their allegiance to the top of the vampire hierarchy the Vampire Council. Also included are feral vampires who have either been without blood, tortured and subjected to holy items for too long. Once a feral state, the vampire loses its ability to reason and only becomes obsessed with feeding. When this state is reached by a vampire, it is nearly impossible to reverse or control without being destroyed. Anita managed to bring Damian back from this state by taking his blood oath. Vampire characteristics The only real universal trait is that they are blood drinking reanimated human corpses, risen from the dead to prey on the living, with a variety of diverse supernatural powers which grow stronger with each passing year; *Immortality. Being animated by supernatural forces which preserve their souls within their unliving cadavers, vampires neither age nor decay; and although they can starve, they cannot starve to death. They are also extremely difficult to harm; wounds from most objects, even bullets, heal in seconds without causing them any seeming discomfort and their unliving nature combined with their preternatural vitality renders them immune to all terrestrial diseases and other biological afflictions. Impaired or disabled humans or those suffering from a debilitating or terminal illness will find their faculties and health fully restored and improved several-fold upon reanimation as a vampire. *Superhuman Physical Attributes. A key characteristic which distinguishes vampires from humans and even other undead is their supernaturally augmented bodies. Their strength is superhuman; able to lift average-sized cars and injure humans with ease, and they move with incredible celerity. Vampires slowly and subtly grow stronger both in physical prowess as well as psychic potency with age; those with several centuries of undeath can send grown men flying across a room with the slightest touch, accidentally kill a human with a backhanded slap, eviscerate giant animals, and move with such speed that they appear to teleport. *Heightened Senses. Their senses are heightened to the point were they can tell a human's emotional state by scent alone, see in the dark, or hear whispered comments from some distance away. *Rolling. Vampires can \\"roll\\" victims by making eye contact. \\"Rolling\\" typically refers to a temporary hypnotic state that vampires can use to conceal their movements (giving them the illusion of instantaneous movement or teleportation), to give commands to the victim, or to reduce the pain of a vampire's bite. Victims with supernatural power, such as other vampires, animators, human servants, and lycanthropes, display varying amounts of resistance to this technique due to their own innate paranormal natures, but most people avoid the technique by not looking vampires directly in the eyes. A victim never remembers rolling, usually have this vague memory of eyes, or sometimes an animal with blazing eyes, or car headlights that were very bright, and after that is black-out, a gap in memory. A skilled hypnotist is usually able to recover lost memory. **Deep Rolling. Given time, a sufficiently powerful vampire can put a victim into an effectively permanent hypnotic state. In Guilty Pleasures, Aubrey uses this technique on Anita's friend Catherine in order to blackmail Anita‚ÄîAnita knows that once deeply rolled, Catherine is Aubrey's to command unless Anita meets his demands. Vampires sometimes pretend to release a rolled human to appease the police, but if they have been \\"deep rolled\\" they can still recall them. Only the death of either the vampire or the human will severe the psychic link. **Mass Hypnosis. Some vampires are able to exert a hypnotic effect over an entire crowd. For example, one of the vampire comedians at the Laughing Corpse used mass hypnosis to convince his audiences that he was funny. Mass hypnosis does not have the same permanent effects as \\"deep rolling\\". Mass hypnosis is not a widely known vampire power, and has its limits. For example, in Bloody Bones, Anita doubts that any vampire could hold three murder victims simultaneously hypnotized while killing them. This form of \\"mind control\\" is the only one currently considered legal. **Vampire's Bite. A vampire's bite can (but apparently does not always) provide the vampire with mental control over the victim. In Guilty Pleasures, Nikolaos bites Anita and states that after a few bites, her control over Anita will be absolute. Anita is able to remove the effect of the bite by disinfecting the wound with holy water. In Circus of the Damned, Anita states that a vampire must enter a victim's mind during a bite to gain control over the victim. A vampire's bite can be intimate and sexually pleasurable depending on the victim's feelings towards the vampire and the use of mind powers, and the act of feeding itself is often seen as a form of intimacy in addition to or even in lieu of sex for both parties. **Empathy. Vampires refer to being able to \\"smell\\" emotions such as fear and lust through their heightened senses, and some vampires are able to detect lies. It is not clear precisely how much of this ability involves literal scent and how much involves mental powers. However, mental powers are clearly a significant component; once Jean-Claude makes Anita his human servant, he is unable to read her emotions, which suggests that the technique is not purely physical. Thanks to Itzpapalotl Anita on occasion can obtain vampire sharpened vision for a while; this sharpened vision alone is enough to notice other person's emotional state and detect a lie, or to notice slightest details, like well-hidden weapons. *Vulnerabilities. They are vulnerable to fire or wounds to the heart caused by wooden or silver weapons. They dislike garlic, can be repelled by religious icons wielded by people with faith, and are burned by holy water and sunlight. Wounds caused by silver or holy water will heal at a human rate and leave scars. They cannot enter a person's home unless they are invited; if the invitation is rescinded, the vampire is barred from the property by an unseen force. =Zombies= Zombies are mindless humans or animals raised from the dead by an animator, a vaundun practitioner, or a necromancer. Although they may appear human and have some of their memories at first, zombies quickly lose their memories and begin to rot. Zombies do not need to eat, but if fed meat, zombies will rot more slowly or not at all. Although not supernaturally strong, zombies are able to use their entire strength without concern for exhaustion or damage. They typically obey their creator's orders absolutely. Zombies are able to operate in daylight, but prefer night, and will hide during the day if permitted. If an animator's corpse is raised as a zombie, it will arise as a flesh-eating zombie‚Äîuncontrollable, much faster than a normal zombie, and with a taste for human flesh. The zombie can only regain its memory and personality by eating human flesh. In another instance, if the victim of a murder is risen as a zombie, the zombie will rise and then actively seek out its murderer. The zombie will then kill the murderer after attacking anything that has gotten in its way. Such a zombie can not be controlled like other zombies, which is clear from the short story Those Who Seek Forgiveness and from the novel Micah. The latter source shows that physical act of killing is irrelevant; causing person's death on purpose creates a murder victim. Vaundun priestess Dominga Salvador created two apparently novel types of zombies. * Salvador was capable of storing the soul of a dead person in a bottle, allowing her to raise zombies before their souls had passed on. By returning the soul to the zombie, Salvador created zombies with souls. This process prevented the zombies from rotting while they had souls, and served as further punishment for the deceased. * Salvador also created a sort of zombie chimera by animating parts of several humans and animals, then melding them into a single monstrous zombie. A version of this type of zombie is also seen in Obsidian Butterfly. =Ghosts= Anita has encountered ghosts before. According to her, ghosts cannot actually harm a living person, but paying attention to them allows them to become more solid and attempt to harass or scare their victims. Anita generally tries to avoid animating a corpse if the deceased person's ghost is still haunting their grave. She appears to have no power over them, as ghosts are a type of \\"soul magic,\\" as noted in The Laughing Corpse. As yet, no clear information on their legal status in the Anitaverse has been revealed. In Crimson Death lack of dead bodies to raise forces Anita to raise crowd of vengeful, angry ghosts; to make them more solid, Anita gave them blood; probably she shared some of her power with them, so ghosts were able to kill vampires. =Ghouls= Ghouls are undead scavengers, who hunt in packs, typically near the cemetery where they live, feed on human corpses and living human flesh. Ghouls have animal or child-level intelligence and typically haunt cemeteries that are no longer holy ground, either because of the passage of time or because of some unholy ritual. Ghouls regard non-ghouls as either potential food or something to run from. As yet, animators in the Anitaverse do not know why most ghouls rise from the dead, although in one case, a pack of ghouls apparently rose when Zachary, an animator, was buried and rose from the dead. The female form is given as ghouleh and the plural is given ghilan. In Dead Ice Anita is surprised by her power working on ghouls; a ghoul took simple orders from her. Shapeshifters Numerous different types of shapeshifters exist in the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter universe, including werewolves and wererats. Anita distinguishes between lycanthropes, which includes solely persons infected by contact with another lycanthrope's bodily fluids, and shapeshifters, a class that includes both lycanthropes and persons who are able to shapeshift as a result of magic, such as a personal or family curse. Other supernatural creatures Anita meets or discusses a variety of other supernatural creatures over the course of the novels. =Faeries= Classified as Homo arcanus rather than Homo sapiens, the fey of the Anitaverse share many similarities with those of Hamilton's later Merry Gentry series of novels. Fey characteristics * Fey are cross-fertile with humans. Humans with part fey ancestry, such as Magnus and Dorcas Bouvier may share some characteristics of full blooded fey. (Because the only fey to appear in the books living in America are the Bouviers and three exotic specimens, Rawhead and Bloody Bones, Xavier and Nuckelavee, this section primarily discusses part-blooded fey descended from the fairy high court, such as the Bouviers). * Part-fey such as the Bouviers appear primarily human. In the case of the Bouviers, their most striking physical characteristics are their otherworldly androgynous beauty, and the ability of their irises to \\"pinwheel\\" closed when their powers are active. * Physical abilities: All fey seen in the Anita Blake novels to date have been preternaturally fast and strong, and unusually resistant to damage. Some fullblooded fey, such as Rawhead, are completely immortal under normal conditions. (Ultimately, Rawhead shared blood with Magnus, rendering Rawhead capable of being killed while Magnus lived). * Cold iron: Unlike vampires and lycanthropes, fey are not bothered by silver. Cold forged iron or even lead is more damaging to them. * Glamour: One of the key abilities of the high court fey is that of glamour, an ability to cast illusions. Humans can resist glamour by placing a variety of magic ointments over their eyes *Example of Glamour; Making mud look and taste like ham. * Sensitivity: Both Magnus and Dorcas were mentally powerful as well, possessing psychic abilities, such as clairvoyance. * Harmony with nature: When Anita walked through the forest with Dorcas, it appeared as if the forest plants moved aside for her, or that she was in harmony with them. (Anita never saw a plant move, but somehow, forest plants were never wherever Dorcas happened to walk.) * Vampirism: Supposedly, it is impossible to raise a member of the fey as a vampire. However, as Xavier showed, this does not appear to be entirely true. Fey social organization * In the Anitaverse, Unseelie fey are barred by law from immigrating into the United States. * The Daoine Sidhe, or fairy high court, is composed of some of the most powerful of the fey. When Anita sees Magnus using glamour, she concludes that he must be descended from the Daoine Sidhe. It is divided into a seelie court of neutral or good fey and an unseelie court of \\"bad\\" fey. * Many people in the Anitaverse have partial fey heritage, and, at least in the U.S., they officially have the same rights and privileges as ordinary humans. Even Dolph Storr, who regards most supernatural beings with some dubiousness, considers having fey blood a non- issue. In practice, however, prejudice against part-fey is prevalent enough that many conceal their heritage. =Trolls= Lesser Smokey mountain troll A small North American species, usually between three and a half feet to around five feet tall. Diet consists mostly of plants but occasionally carrion or insects. They walk as humans do, the only other primate species to do so, and are covered in black colored \\"fur.\\" They are also what Richard has studied for four years in order to obtain his master's degree. Greater Smokey mountain troll A large aggressive and carnivorous species of troll, ranging from eight to twelve feet tall. They were hunted to extinction, because they had been fond of pulling trees up by their roots, beating people to death with them, and then eating the marrow out of their bones. North American cave troll The smallest troll species on North America, one member of the species (named Peter) was attempted to be converted into Christianity, by a human named Simon Barkley. A scientific journal in 1910 had been published with the information that some trolls had buried their dead with personal artifacts. The newspapers expanded on that information, proclaiming that the trolls mentioned must believe in an afterlife. Simon Barkley wrote a book describing his time with Peter and a professor of Anita's had a picture of Peter looking like he was praying. =Dragons= Dragons are known to have existed in the Anita Blake novels, as seen on page 544 of Obsidian Butterfly. However, it implies that most species, if not all, are extinct in present times. =Gargoyles= In The Lunatic Cafe, page 55, gargoyles are described as carrion eaters with the nearest grouping located in Kentucky. It is possible that they will attack a man, but it happens rarely. In France, there are three species reported that are either bigger than a human or human sized. =Quetzalcoatl= The status of the supposedly extinct Quetzalcoatl Draconus Giganticus, shortened to Quetzalcoatl, is up for debate, called either a subspecies of dragons or gargoyles or sometimes a class of their own. The Spanish were believed to have hunted them to extinction in their conquest of the Aztecs; however, a living example is seen in Obsidian Butterfly, so this classification may be incorrect. There is a deceased Quetzalcoatl in the Chicago Field Museum, though it is thought a far cry from the living thing. The Quetzalcoatl is an iridescent green/blue which, as it nears the snout, loses most of the green, with a white belly and underside of wings. Multihued feathers fringe its round eyes, which are compared to that of a bird of prey's, and its wings are the same rainbow of colors as the feathers. It is armed with rows of saw-like teeth and claws. Anita describes it as \\"one of the most beautiful things [she had] ever seen.\\" First seen in Obsidian Butterfly, the Quetzalcoatl featured is a servant of the Red Woman's Husband, devouring human flesh given to it by its master. After the Red Woman's Husband's death, it disappeared without a trace and has so far not been mentioned. =Demons= Although rarely encountered in the novels, demons also exist in the Anitaverse; little has been revealed about them to date save that they are vastly powerful and evil entities, apparently residing in an otherworldly dimension and visiting Earth only when summoned by magic or when possessing weak willed humans (with mental illness seen as a potential risk factor for possession). Prior to Anita's own encounter with a demon in Blue Moon, there had been no known direct demon attacks upon humans since the Middle Ages. Devils, also known as \\"greater demons,\\" are even rarer and considered among the most dangerous creatures in existence; when, in Obsidian Butterfly, Edward suggests that a Devil might be responsible for the mutilations and murders, Anita initially half-believes him to be joking. =Merfolk= Mermaids (and their male counterparts) exist within the Anitaverse. Merfolk with a power similar to the ardeur are known as sirens who seductively lure men into inhumanly strange but intensely pleasurable sexual unions, only to drown or kill them in some other way. Sirens have the power to \\"roll\\" the minds of people in a similar fashion to vampires. Due to their potential power over other merfolk, sirens are traditionally slain by merfolk before they can become a danger. Master Vampire of the City of Cape Cod Samuel has merfolk as his animal to call, and his wife Leucothea is the last living siren. Humans Humans are very prominent in the Anitaverse. Anita has many human friends, most of whom are on the police force. Humans by nature don't have any special powers, and are not nearly as strong as most of the preternatural creatures in the books. However, some, like Blake, and her fellow animators, are born with talents that, if developed, enables them to rival or surpass other more powerful creatures. In addition, those who serve vampire masters acquire powers through that service: see the section below on human servants. =Psychics= Psychics are humans that are born with different types of preternatural abilities, so it is debatable whether they are truly human or not. Some psychic abilities include: *Clairvoyance; the bearer of the power can touch a random object and can tell who else has touched it, and what they did with that object. Can be used to find murderers, or where the murder victim is. *Telepathy; telepaths can read minds, and although Anita has not met a telepath, she briefly mentions them in the series. Although psychic abilities may be very prominent, some people don't even know they're psychic. For example, Zerbrowski, one of Anita's police friends, is said to be a little psychic. When a vampire's power is floating around the room, Anita is said to have seen Zerbrowski shiver, and none of the other police officers. =Animators= Animators are said to be very rare, though not as rare as necromancers. There are three animating firms in the US according to Anita, and the firm she works for, Animators Inc., has about 6 different animators working there. Animators are born with their powers, and Anita is not sure she was ever human, even from birth. Animators have the ability resist vampires' hypnotic powers to some degree and to raise and control zombies. However, they can only control zombies, while necromancers (like Anita) can control all types of dead, and most undead. =Necromancers= Anita is primarily a necromancer, which gives her the ability to control the dead. They can raise zombies easier than animators, and sometimes don't even need an animal sacrifice. They can also control vampires. In the daytime, they can animate a vampires corpse, whilst it is soulless. Towards the last few books Anita can also control vampires while they are alive, in daytime. Necromancers, as a Vampire's human servant, add greatly to the creation of a power triad, called a triumvirate. A triumvirate includes master vampire, a human servant, and an animal servant. When a triumvirate includes a necromancer as human servant and a lycanthrope as animal servant, the necromancer may act as the bridge between the vampire and the lycanthrope, since a necromancer is a living being (like lycanthrope) and possesses death magic (like a vampire). =Human Servants= Human servants are bound to a master vampire by a magic called marks. There are four types of mark needed; the first is a kind of extension of the vampires' life force that allows their servant to heal more rapidly and gives them some resistance to vampiric hypnosis, the second comes in a vision of flame and allows the vampire to feed on the metabolism of their servant (when the servant eats/drinks the vampire shares the experience), the third mark involves the vampire feeding from their servant directly allowing the sharing of thoughts and memories between the two, and when the servant is forever bound by the fourth (final) mark which involves the servant drinking the vampires' blood, he/she becomes immortal. The relationship between a vampire and his or her human servant(s) is described as an intimate and eternal union of their flesh, blood, and souls. The human servant should only die when the vampire they are bound to dies, although Anita has proven that wrong on several occasions, in the third book Anita lives on as she kills the vampire she is bound to. Also, if the human servant is killed, due to physical or metaphysical force (although they cannot be poisoned or infected with a pathogen), the vampire they are tied to may die as well, unless that vampire is a sufficiently powerful master, such as Asher or Nikolaos.

The next day, the committee requested a charter from the New England Department Headquarters of the American Boy Scouts. At a September 8, 1910 executive committee meeting, the organization selected its first officers. On March 12, 1911, the organization voted to break away from the American Boy Scouts and was renamed as the Rhode Island Boy Scouts. The State issued a state charter to the RIBS as a state institution. In 1917 RIBS merged with the BSA granting all members of RIBS back service. RIBS kept its corporate identity after the merger allowing it to continue receiving bequests, funds, and properties. RIBS owns many of the properties operated by Narragansett Council with the exceptions of Cachalot Scout Reservation, acquired through a 2002 merger with Moby Dick Council and Camp Norse which was acquired in 2015 through a merger with Annawon Council.

Its length is between 3 and 6 cm and it is easily distinguished from other small fish by its iridescent blue eyes which give its name. There are nine red vertical bars running right round the body, and an orange tinge to the back and head. In the breeding season in winter the orange on the males becomes brighter on the head, tail, and anal fin. The rest of the body becomes blue/black. Males set up nests in small depressions on vertical rock faces at depths of about 10 to 20 m where females are encouraged to lay their eggs. The nest is then guarded. The blue-eyed triplefin's diet includes small crustaceans (including amphipods and copepods), and has been known to remove parasites from larger fish. This fish count (at 2017) is 58.

Opened in April 1993, this state prison has a design capacity of 2,694 incarcerated people. North Kern serves as a reception center for incoming inmates. Inmates usually serve two to three months at North Kern while staff processes their criminal and health records and assesses their physiological and social needs before assigning them to another prison. While at North Kern, inmates have opportunities to engage in educational programs. With North Kern State Prison and Kern Valley State Prison, which is located one mile away and houses approximately 3,500 inmates, Kern County has one of the largest prison populations of any county in America. History Location of Delano in Kern County, and Kern County in California In the early 1990s, California experienced a significant growth in the number of inmates. Many rural counties lobbied to house a prison because of the health care and job opportunities that a prison provides for its employees. Delano was one of the cities in the counties. Since North Kern State Prison opened in 1993, the city has grown immensely. Before the two prisons were built, Delano was a rural city with a large migrant farm-worker population. The construction of the two prisons helped the small city develop into a more urban society. Delano benefited from the new sewage system being built as well as new electrical infrastructure, and spurred retail and housing development. Facilities North Kern is an all-male facility with a design capacity of 2,694. As of April 30, 2020, North Kern was incarcerating people at 134.7% of its design capacity, with 3,630 occupants. Of these, a majority are housed in the Reception Center (RC) waiting to be transferred to another state prison and approximately 1,400 inmates live in the mainline part of the prison. Inmates are separated by security and custody levels upon arriving at North Kern. There are 5 facilities or \\"yards\\" at this prison. Facility A, B, C, D, and Minimum(Formerly E). A yard possesses 800-1000 level 3 mainline inmates. Yards B-D are RC yards. The Minimum yard possesses 100-200 level 1 inmates who work and live in a less secure housing unit located outside the main facility. In the event of a lockdown, minimum yard inmates will come into the main prison to provide support services. During regular operating procedure, mainline A yard inmates provide support services throughout the prison, for example, kitchen, laundry, education, and library. A and D yard inmates live in cell housing units while yards B, C and Minimum reside in dorm housing units. In addition to holding a job at the prison, mainline inmates are eligible for education and reentry programs. Inmates housed in the Reception Center (RC) typically spend two to three months at North Kern before being transferred to another prison. They stay behind the electrical fence and, if approved, may help run support services. North Kern has four cellblocks with each cellblock having its own yard. All cells are doubled bunked. Most RC inmates are custody level four inmates and reside in cells. A few lower custody RC inmates that stay in dorms. Overcrowding is a day-to-day reality, hence the double bunked cells. The sewage system was also not built for such a large population, leading to periodic toxic spills. A grinder and a backup sewage system were installed a few years after the prison opened to crush the excess trash and help the sewage system run more efficiently. Three fences surround North Kern i.e. two razor wire fences with an electric fence in the middle. Several towers are stationed around the prison to reinforce the fence line. Programs North Kern offers a variety of programs to the inmates. Since most inmates coming into prison do not have a high school education, GED classes are offered. As of 2013, North Kern offers no vocational training programs. Incidents North Kern has experienced frequent racial tension. The two preeminent gangs are the Sure√±os and the Paisas (Mexican nationals). On October 1, 2007, an inmate escaped from the institution. The inmate, 29-year-old Abelardo Morales, was reported missing from the Level I yard of the prison at 9:17 p.m. Morales was serving a one-year, six-month term for manufacture and sales of narcotics, and possession of a weapon. On the night of April 21, 2015, a guard walking a yard at North Kern State Prison was struck by gunfire, which penetrated his stab-proof vest. He was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. Authorities believe the gunman was outside the prison walls when the shots were fired. Visitation The number of visitation hours for which each inmate is eligible depends on his security and custody level. Inmates with few infractions are allowed to have visits more often and longer. The mainline inmates are allowed to have human contact visits as well as conjugal visits but only from their wives. The RC inmates must have their visits behind glass.

After his education he returned to Turkey and, with the express approval of President ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At first taking up diplomatic posts throughout Europe, Kuneralp was later appointed Turkish Ambassador to Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Spain, as well as twice serving as Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry. He survived an assassination attempt which claimed the lives of his wife and her brother in Madrid in 1978. He retired, in part due to ill- health, in 1979, renouncing the world and current affairs,Obituary: Zeki Kuneralp by David Barchard The Independent Wednesday 12 August 1998 https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-zeki- kuneralp-1171140.html and turning his attention instead to writing and publishing. His autobiography was translated into English in 1992, while others of his books are considered important sources of twentieth century Turkish history. He died in Istanbul in 1998. Biography Born in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire in October 1914, Kuneralp was the second son of Ali Kemal, a journalist, writer, and politician, by his second wife, Sabiha Hanƒ±m. Ali Kemal was a political opponent of the nationalists at the time of the British, French, and Italian Occupation of Constantinople, during the Turkish War of Independence. He was detained when the revolutionaries won in 1922 and taken to Ankara to an Independence Tribunal, but the ferry (or train) he was put on stopped at Izmit and there he was murdered by young Turkish soldiers. After the kidnap and murder of his father his mother took the family into exile in Switzerland. There he received his education, and a Law doctorate from the University of Bern in 1938, where he also joined the fraternity \\"Z√§hringia Bernensis\\". When permission for him to enter the Turkish Foreign Ministry was granted personally by President ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º in 1942, Kuneralp began his career there, going on to become one of the most brilliant diplomats of his generation. Early in his career, he was posted to Bucharest, Prague, Paris, and Turkey's NATO Delegation. A strong believer in Turkish-Greek friendship, Kuneralp worked hard but unsuccessfully to repair the damage done to Turkish- Greek relations by the rift over Cyprus between 1954 and 1964. He was ambassador to Bern from 1960 until 1964 when he was made ambassador to London from 1964 to 1966 and again from 1969 to 1972, while in the interval he served twice as Secretary-General (or permanent under-secretary) of the Foreign Ministry in Ankara. During the latter stage of his diplomatic life in London, Kuneralp began to be afflicted by progressive multiple sclerosis, which left him unable to walk without support. In 1978, while Kuneralp was serving as ambassador in Madrid, three gunmen opened fire on his car one morning outside his home. The ambassador's wife, Necla Kuneralp, and her brother-in-law, retired Ambassador Be≈üir Balcƒ±oƒülu, were killed in the attack. Responsibility was claimed by a militant Armenian group, variously named as ASALA (Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia) or the Justice Commandos Against Armenian Genocide. The attackers opened fire on Balcioglu, who was using crutches, perhaps supposing him to be Kuneralp. The attack was one of a series of assassinations of Turkish diplomats and officials during the 1970s and 1980s, and the first in which a non-Turk (Kuneralp's Spanish driver, Antonio Torres) was fatally injured. Despite this tragedy, Kuneralp‚Äôs intellectual distinction and energy remained as strong as ever. During his retirement he wrote several books, including an edited version of his father's autobiography and an autobiography of his own, as well as works on recent aspects of Turkish diplomatic history. His autobiography, Sadece Diplomat, was translated into English and appeared under the title \\"Just a Diplomat\\". He died in Istanbul of progressive multiple sclerosis. An article, \\"Ambassador Extraordinary\\", describing his life and personality, was published after his death in Number 16 of the magazine Cornucopia, 1998, as well as a short volume of memoirs by his British and Turkish friends giving details of his career. This was published in 1998 by the Isis Press in Istanbul as Zeki Kuneralp 1914‚Äì1998: A Tribute by Friends and Family. One of his British friends, Sir Bernard Burrows, a former ambassador to Ankara, said that Kuneralp could best be described as a saint, adding that this was an unusual quality in a diplomat. Kuneralp always retained his affection for Switzerland, the country of his upbringing, and spoke the Swiss dialect of German fluently, sometimes startling groups of Swiss visitors. Kuneralp had two sons who both survive him, Sinan, a leading Istanbul publisher, and Selim, who went into the diplomatic service and has been Turkey's ambassador to Sweden and South Korea. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is Ali Kemal Bey's great grandson and Kuneralp's great nephew.

Both are named for the South American revolutionary, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. The Cuban-produced Bol√≠var cigars are very full- bodied, with considerable ligero in the blend and have traditionally been some of the strongest and most full-bodied Havana cigars.Bati, Anwer, The Cigar Companion; Philadelphia, PA: Running Press, , 9780762401420 (1993), pp. 66-68  History  The brand was founded (possibly in Great Britain) by Jos√© F. Rocha around 1901 or 1902, though the brand was not registered in Havana (Cuba) until 1921, under the ownership of Rocha's firm, J.F. Rocha y Cia. During this time, the Bol√≠var brand produced the world's smallest cigar called the Delgado. Measuring a mere 1 inches with a 20 ring gauge, the Delgado had the honor of having a miniature box of its cigars featured in the royal nursery's dollhouse at Windsor Castle. The company and rights to the brand name were purchased in 1954 by Cifuentes y Cia after Rocha's death and production was moved to the famous Part√°gas Factory in Havana (today known as the Francisco P√©rez Germ√°n factory), where many of its sizes are still produced today. The Cuban Bol√≠var has a reputation among cigar aficionados of being one of the strongest and most full-bodied cigars, with its Royal Corona, Coronas Junior, Petit Coronas, and Belicosos Finos being famous examples of the marque. In 2002, when Altadis bought a controlling share in the Cuban government-owned cigar distributor, Habanos SA, a number of changes in cigar production were instituted. One of these changes was the decision to gradually turn the various brands of Cuban cigars to either all-handmade or all-machine- made lines. Bol√≠var, which has historically produced a variety of handmade and machine-made or machine-finished cigars, had several of its vitolas cut from production, with only one remaining, the cigarillo-sized Chicos. It remains to be seen if this size will eventually cease to be produced as well. In 2004, Wolters in Cologne, Germany, had a few thousand boxes of Bol√≠var Gold Medals produced by Habanos SA exclusively for their shop.

General Cigar's initial blend for their Bolivar branded cigars used mild Olor filler tobacco from the Dominican Republic, and bore little resemblance to the original Havana Bol√≠var in either body or flavor. In 2005, the Dominican Bol√≠var brand was completely reformulated with the addition of a Honduran San Agustin ligero wrapper and Nicaraguan filler tobacco in the blend to more closely approximate the full-bodied strength of the Cuban Bol√≠var.General Cigar Press Release (July, 2005), General Cigar To Debut Bolivar Cigar In popular culture In the movie Black Hawk Down, Somali warlord Osman Ali Atto smokes Bolivar Belicoso cigars.

It was formerly known as Tiburon Entertainment, which was acquired by EA in 1998. EA had already purchased a minority equity interest in Tiburon in May 1996, the terms of which included that Tiburon would develop games exclusively for EA. The studio is best known for developing the Madden NFL series of games. In addition to the usual titles developed by the studio which include Madden, NCAA Football, NFL Street, NASCAR, and NFL Head Coach, in late 2006 Tiburon released the Superman Returns game based on the movie of the same name. EA Tiburon has taken over the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series from EA Salt Lake as of the 2008 edition of the game. History =Tiburon Entertainment= Tiburon Entertainment was originally founded by John Schappert, Jason Andersen, and Steve Chiang, all of them being previous engineers for the company Visual Concepts, located in Novato, California. Soon after leaving Visual Concepts, Schappert and Anderson would move to Florida and begin working towards opening a new video game software developing studio. Tiburon Entertainment was soon established in Orlando, Florida, 1994 by Schappert and Anderson, with Steve Chiang joining as a third investment. The name of the studio, Tiburon, comes from the Spanish word \\"tibur√≥n,\\" which means shark. While the newly formed company had just three employees and 900 feet of office space at the time, it did carve a niche for itself by writing programs for large gaming companies like EA. Tiburon developed its own video game concepts and software in addition to creating games based on the ideas of Electronic Arts and other distributors. EA initially hired Tiburon to produce ‚ÄúMadden 96‚Äù for the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. Tiburon began producing Madden for the newer systems and were the first designers to infuse the game with a three- dimensional feel for the players and stadiums for the two-game systems until they became outdated with the introduction of Sony's PlayStation. Eventually, Tiburon would start developing the Madden video game series, starting with Madden NFL ‚Äô96 and NCAA Football. Some other titles that Tiburon made include College Football USA 97, Madden NFL 97, Soviet Strike, and Slam: Shaq vs. the Legends which were released on several different game consoles such as Sega Mega Drive, Sega Saturn game consoles, SNES, and PlayStation. = Tiburon Entertainment and Electronic Arts = The relationship between EA and Tiburon has existed since the company's beginnings. While Tiburon developed programs for large gaming companies, the company had some strong ties to EA because of the work done on the Madden series by Schappert, Anderson, and Chiang, who had done business with EA when they were working at Visual Concepts. EA was already a minority investor in the privately held company Tiburon and owned about 19.9 percent of Tiburon since April 1996. Later on, EA would soon purchase a minority equity interest of Tiburon on May 7, 1996. Included in this purchase, Tiburon would become an exclusive developer for Electronic Arts for entertainment software on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and other video- game systems. In 1996 Tiburon would form a contract with EA to help develop a new college football game (which became NCAA Football 98, released in 1997). With this investment made, the company would move from its 4,000-square-foot office in Longwood to an 8,600-square-foot site in Maitland Center. =Acquisition by EA (1998 - Present)= The EA/Tiburon partnership flourished as Tiburon continued to design top-selling interactive game software for EA and led to the acquisition of Tiburon by EA on April 2, 1998. Since the purchase, Tiburon Entertainment was re-branded to EA Tiburon and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Electronic Arts. Along with this, the studio went on to oversee the Madden franchise and still continues to do so to this day. EA had also constructed a new 25,000 square foot state-of-the-art creative center that would house the designers, programmers, and artists of Tiburon Entertainment. Up until a few years ago, EA Tiburon had been a division of EA Sports, but with some recent reorganization of the company, there have been some changes and now is its own independent subsidiary. Currently, EA Tiburon is still considered one of the largest video game studios in Florida and is employing over 500 people. Over the past few years, there have been other developing teams that have been incorporated into EA Tiburon such as Hypnotix after EA acquired some smaller video game development companies. EA Tiburon's Maitland headquarters continues to have renovations and expansions done to the building with the intent to allow employees to move more easily between workspaces and foster more collaboration. Some other additions include an updated infrastructure and video-game themed art along the walls of each floor. In late 2019, it was announced that EA Tiburon would move its headquarters from the Maitland Center to the Creative Village in Downtown Orlando. The new headquarters is expected to be completed in 2021.

He began his film career in quota quickies in the 1930s and until the late 1950s was virtually unknown; he was seldom credited. He played one of the two murderers in the Olivier film version of Richard III (1955). Ripper became a mainstay in Hammer Film Productions playing supporting character roles: coachmen, peasants, tavern keepers, pirates and sidekicks. Appearing in more of the company's films than any other performer, these included The Camp on Blood Island (1958), The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958), The Mummy (1959), The Brides of Dracula (1960), Captain Clegg (1962), The Scarlet Blade (1963), The Reptile (1966), The Plague of the Zombies (1966) and The Mummy's Shroud (1967). Occasionally he was disguised almost beyond recognition, yet his raspy voice remained unmistakable. Some of his parts were little better than glorified bits (as in The Curse of the Werewolf), but his penultimate role for Hammer Films was a significant supporting part as a landlord in Scars of Dracula in 1970. (His very last Hammer role was as a railway worker in the atypical comedy That's Your Funeral two years later.) He is also well remembered for his role as a jockey/horse trainer in The Belles of St Trinian's and the liftman in the next three of the St. Trinian's comedies, and on television for his role as Thomas the chauffeur in the BBC comedy Butterflies (1978‚Äì83) and as Burke, one of the two criminals in the youth television series Freewheelers (1968‚Äì71). His other TV roles include Mr Shepherd, Aunt Sally's owner, in Worzel Gummidge, Phunkey in The Pickwick Papers (1985) and the Drones Porter in Jeeves and Wooster (1990‚Äì91).

Nomadi, 1972 Career =Origins= In 1961, Beppe Carletti and Leonardo Manfredini formed the group I Monelli (‚ÄòUrchins‚Äô). In 1962, Carletti met Franco Midilli, guitarist of the group Novellara, who joined them in Monelli. In 1963 Franco Midilli introduced Augusto Daolio to Beppe Carletti and he too joined the group. In that year the band‚Äôs name was changed to Nomadi. =I Nomadi of Augusto Daolio= I Nomadi sprang from one of the most fervent periods of the Italian music scene: the 1960s. In those years an economic boom revealed an Italy economically enriched but already socially impoverished. Tens, if not hundreds, of groups appeared and disappeared attempting to express the voice of a youth who felt repressed by a society still permeated with antiquated conventions. The original 1963 formation of six was founded in Reggio Emilia: Augusto Daolio (vocals), Beppe Carletti (keyboards), Franco Midili (guitar), Leonardo Manfredini (drums), Gualtiero Gelmini (sax), Antonio Campari (bass). In the same year Nomadi were signed by Frankfurt Bar in Riccione. Franco Midilli had to leave the group that summer for compulsory military service. As often happens, the lineup changed frequently: in 1964 Madfredini left after the death of his parents; so did Campari and Gelmini, who were replaced by Gabriele ‚ÄòBila‚Äô Copellini on drums and Gianni Coron on bass. In 1965 they released their first 45\\", featuring the song \\"Donna, la Prima Donna\\" (\\"Woman, the First Woman\\") and \\"Giorni Tristi\\" (\\"Sad Days\\") with the collaboration of De Ponti and of Odoardo Veroli (known as Dodo) as writer and composer. Their first hit was 1966's \\"Come potete giudicar\\" (How Can You Judge, which was actually the cover of Sonny Bono's \\"The Revolution Kind\\"), anthem of the Italian beat generation, which exemplifies the clash between hippies and conservatives. In the wake of this success i Nomadi came into contact with a young and then unknown writer, Francesco Guccini, who would go on to give them other successes: \\"Noi non ci saremo\\" (\\"We Won't Be There\\"), \\"Dio √® morto\\" (\\"God is Dead\\"), \\"Canzone per un'amica\\" (\\"Song for a Friend\\"). Their great success continued in the following years. Hits included \\"Io Vagabondo\\" (\\"I, Vagabond\\"), \\"Un pugno di sabbia\\" (\\"A Fistful of Sand\\"), \\"Un giorno insieme\\" (\\"One Day Together\\"), \\"Tutto a posto\\" (\\"Everything Settled\\"), \\"Voglio ridere\\" (\\"I Want to Laugh\\"). I Nomadi's political commitment is particularly evident in some songs such as \\"Primavera di Praga\\" (\\"Prague Spring\\"), written by Guccini and dedicated to Czech student Jan Palach. =The \\"new\\" Nomadi= In 1990 Cico Falzone and Daniele Campani joined the group, on guitar and drums respectively. In 1992 bass player Dante Pergreffi was killed in a car crash on 14 May and then, on 7 October, Augusto Daolio, the band's frontman and icon, died of an aggressive form of lung cancer. Despite the shock and despair of their many fans, the group decided to continue with Danilo Sacco doing vocals, Francesco Gualerzi on wind and vocals and Elisa Minari on bass. Gualerzi and Minari left the group at the end of 1997 and were replaced by Massimo Vecchi and Andrea Pozzoli, who took part in the summer tour of that year and was then replaced by Sergio Reggioli, enchanting on violin. The new lineup convinced the fans and Nomadi continue even now to release new albums. =40th anniversary= In 2003 Nomadi celebrated their 40th year as a band with a three-day show at Riccione followed by three more concerts and other events related to the past and the future of the group. The music and the message The message that Nomadi has promoted from its beginning is of denunciation and social commitment, clean and never too political. They carry it throughout Italy, even in the smallest towns. Their sound is instantly recognisable for its cleaness and simpleness, even if some arrangements on the old albums tended to be a bit overblown as was typical of the 1960s in general. In 2003 they released Quaranta (Forty), a double CD with 34 tracks. In 2004 the new album Corpo Estraneo (Foreign Body) came out and went platinum just on advance sales. The single Oriente (East) was successful on many radio stations and the tour sold out every show. They came first in the Groups category of the Sanremo Music Festival 2006 with the track Dove si Va (Where Does One Go). The new album Con Me o Contro di Me (With Me or Against Me) came out at the beginning of March 2006 and sold 90,000 copies in the first four days, going platinum, and in 2007 they released Orchestra, an album-live. In 2011, the singer Danilo Sacco left the band, and was replaced by Christian Turato. Part of a new experience for the group, which is approaching 50 years of activity.

The lake is approximately long (about 240 acres) and at its deepest point is deep, and is one of the largest natural lakes in Wales. At its south- eastern end it is linked to the neighbouring Llyn Peris (which forms the lower reservoir of the Dinorwig power station). The busy village of Llanberis lies on the southern banks of the lake. Most of Llyn Padarn is owned by Gwynedd Council and is part of Padarn Country Park. Whilst kayaking, rowing and sailing are permitted on the lake, powered craft require permission to use it. Bangor University Rowing Club row at Llyn Padarn. In April 2014 Llyn Padarn was designated as Bathing Water under the Bathing Water Directive (2006/7/EC). The outflow of Llyn Padarn is on the northern shore and is called Afon Rhythallt, which passes by the village of Brynrefail, Gwynedd and becomes Afon Seiont below Pont Rhythallt, near Llanrug. It reaches the sea at Caernarfon. Padarn Country Park is located on the northern flank of the lake, including Coed Allt Wen, a rare and ancient sessile oak woodland. Both the woodland and Llyn Padarn are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The Llanberis Lake Railway also runs along its eastern bank and various recreational activities take place on the lake, especially during the summer. These include canoeing, boating and fishing. The lake was the venue for the rowing events of the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games. Former local bus company Padarn Bus, which operated between 1979 and 2014 from a base at nearby Llanberis, was named after the lake. 1993 RAF Helicopter Crash In 1993, an RAF Westland Wessex helicopter suffered a rotor failure, and crashed into the lake, killing three Air Training Corps Cadets, Christopher Bailey (15) from Horwich, Mark Oakden (16) and Amanda Whitehead (17) from Bury, and injuring one.

Entrepreneur Pieter Loopuyt asked Queen Wilhelmina in October 1909 for permission to name the village after the newborn princess. Permission was granted. During World War II, Julianadorp changed its name to Loopuytdorp, because the Germans were not pleased with the link to the Dutch Royal family. After the war, the village got its original name back.

The male's breeding colours are dark orange on the head and forepart of the body, and yellow on the rest. Its common name and its specific name both honour the marine biologist John C.

During the Counter-Reformation, there was a special interest among the Augustinian friars in the theological debates of the day, as well as a need to return to the roots of their way of life. In an effort to seek a more simple and spiritual life, various friars banded together and followed a pattern seen in other mendicant orders, in which simplicity of dress and a stricter form of a life of prayer and penance were embraced. Among the Augustinians, there also was an effort to return to the eremetical origins of their Order. As with the Carmelite reform of the same period, these friars came to be known by their practice of wearing sandals, as opposed to shoes (thus the term discalced or barefoot), in an effort to live more like the poor. This reform was approved by the 100th General Chapter of the Augustinian friars, which was held during May 1592 at the Friary of St. Augustine in Rome, motherhouse of the entire Order. The new branch which thus developed was approved by the Vatican as a separate Order in 1610. Their current motherhouse is in Rome. As of 2012, they numbered 220 friars, of which 139 were priests, and served at 33 parishes located in Italy, Brazil and the Philippines.

written by John Cowper Powys (1873‚Äì1963) in rural upstate New York and first published by Simon and Schuster in New York City in March 1932. An English edition published by John Lane followed in 1933. It is the second of Powys's Wessex novels, along with Wolf Solent (1929), Weymouth Sands (1934) and Maiden Castle (1936). Powys was an admirer of Thomas Hardy and these novels are set in Somerset and Dorset parts of Hardy's mythical Wessex.Powys's first novel Wood and Stone (1915) was dedicated to Thomas Hardy. See also Autobiography (1967), pp. 224-5, 227, 229-30, etc. The action occurs over roughly a year, and the first two chapters of A Glastonbury Romance take place in Norfolk, where the late Canon William Crow's will is read, and the Crow family learn that his secretary-valet John Geard has inherited his wealth. John Cowper Powys and Norfolk Also in Norfolk, a romance begins between cousins, John and Mary Crow. However, after an important scene at the ancient monument of Stonehenge, the rest of the action takes place in or near the Somerset town of Glastonbury, which is some twenty miles north of the village of Montacute. Powys's father, the Reverend Charles Francis Powys (1843‚Äì1923), was parish priest of Montacute from 1885 to 1918, and it was here that Powys grew up. The grail legends associated with the town of Glastonbury are of major importance in this novel. Introduction and summary of the plot In Powys's words this novel's \\"heroine is the Grail\\",\\"Preface\\" to A Glastonbury Romance. London: Macdonald, 1955, p. xiii. and its central concern is with the various myths and legends along with history associated with Glastonbury. It is also possible to see most of the main characters, John Geard, Sam Dekker, John Crow, and Owen Evans as undertaking a Grail quest. Not only is A Glastonbury Romance concerned with the legend that Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail, a vessel containing the blood of Christ, to the town, but the further tradition that King Arthur was buried there. In addition one of the novels main characters, the Welshman Owen Evans, introduces the idea that the Grail has a Welsh (Celtic), pagan pre-Christian origin. The main sources for Powys's ideas on mythology and the Grail legend are Sir John Rhys's Studies in the Arthurian Legend, R. S. Loomis's Celtic Myth and Arthurian Romance, and the works of Jessie L. Weston, including From Ritual to Romance.Krissdottir, Morine. Descent of Memory: The Life of John Cowper Powys . London: Overlook Press, 2007, pp. 252-3. T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land is another probable influence. A central aspect of A Glastonbury Romance is the attempt by John Geard, ex-minister now the mayor of Glastonbury, to restore Glastonbury to its medieval glory as a place of religious pilgrimage. On the other hand, the Glastonbury industrialist Philip Crow, along with John and Mary Crow, and Tom Barter, who, like him, are from Norfolk, view the myths and legends of the town with contempt. Philip's vision is of a future with more mines and more factories. John Crow, however, as he is penniless, takes on the task of organizing a pageant for Geard. At the same time an alliance of Anarchists, Marxists, and Jacobins try to turn Glastonbury into a commune. Glastonbury Tor from Street, Somerset A Glastonbury Romance is also the first of several novels by Powys that reflect his growing interest in Welsh mythology, the others are Maiden Castle (1935), Morwyn (1937), Owen Glendower (1941), and Porius (1951). Like Powys, Owen Evans is a devoted student of Welsh mythology. He also resembles Powys in that he has strong urges toward violence and sadism, and is often tempted by sadistic pornography. But Evans is not the only character that resembles his creator, as both John Geard and John Crow reflect, in different ways, aspects of Powys's personality. A Glastonbury Romance has several climactic moments, before the major final one. Firstly there is Sam Dekker's decision, following his Grail vision, to give-up of his adulterous affair with Nell Zoyland, and to lead a monk-like existence. Then there's Evans' failed attempt to destroy his sadistic urge, by playing the part of Christ on the Cross at the Easter Pageant. Followed, however, by his wife Cordelia's ability to defeat his desire to witness a murder. The attempted murder of John Crow is equally climatic. But this involves Tom Barter's death, when he saves his friend John Crow, who is Mad Bet's intended victim. Finally the novel concludes with the a flooding of the low lying country surrounding Glastonbury, so that it becomes once again the legendary Isle of Avalon. This causes the death of Geard, and ends his ambitious plans for Glastonbury. However, the ending is ambiguous, rather than tragic, because just before he dies, Geard asks John Crow: \\"do you suppose anyone's ever committed suicide out of an excess of life, simply to enjoy the last experience in full consciousness?\\" (1955 edition, p. 1041). Characters in \\"A Glastonbury Romance\\" The High Street, Glastonbury * John Geard, a mystic who influenced the late Canon Crow of Glastonbury and received the man's riches when he died. Geard becomes mayor of the town during the course of the novel and becomes obsessed with the Grail Legend, commissioning new monuments for the town and promoting his own religious brand of Grail-worship. He is married to Megan Geard - a marriage that is still physically passionate unlike that of Geard's rival, Philip Crow. Geard becomes fascinated with the youthful and delicate daughter of the Marquis of P., Rachel Zoyland. Megan Geard has Welsh ancestry, as her maiden name was Rhys.A Glastonbury Romance, (Macdonald: London, 1955), p. 124. * Cordelia Geard, daughter of John and Megan Geard. Her name Cordelia may indicate a mythological identification with Creiddylad, daughter of Lludd in The Mabinogion.The Mabinogion, translated by Lady Charlotte Guest (1906). J. M. Dent: London, 1927, p. 310. Her admirer, Owen Evans, identifies her with the Grail Messenger.A Glastonbury Romance (1955), p. 800. Creiddylad is the name that Porius gives to the giantess in Powys's novel, Porius. * John Crow, a young man from Norfolk who is coming to Glastonbury in the opening scene of the novel. He eventually marries his cousin Mary Crow and works for John Geard. A skeptic and cynic himself, he sees his work for Geard as a way of debasing and mocking the very Grail- worship he is supposed to promote. * Philip Crow, a cousin to John and an industrialist. He is widely hated by the citizens of the town for his attempt to industrialise it. He too hates the Grail legend, and seeks to unseat Geard. * Tom Barter, a childhood friend of John Crow. He initially works for Philip Crow but leaves to join John Geard. He is a somewhat depressed womaniser who carries a flame for Mary Crow but marries Tossie Stickles after she becomes pregnant. * Owen Evans, a Welsh mystic and antiquarian and a friend of John Crow. He has strong urges toward violence and sadism, and is often tempted by an anonymous book in his keep. * Mat Dekker, the town vicar. He is also wary of Geard's new religion and is also described as being an enemy of the anthropomorphised sun. * Sam Dekker, the vicar's son. He carries an on-and-off affair with Nell Zoyland, wife of Will Zoyland, and goes through several spiritual conversions during the course of the novel. * Persephone Spear, wife of Communist leader Dave Spear and longtime mistress to Philip Crow. Wookey Hole The Grail and mysticism in the novel The Grail in the novel is depicted not only in its original, Christian guise, but is mixed in with local folklore and Celtic mythology. During the early 20th century much scholarly work (and conventional wisdom) focused on finding an origin for the Grail of medieval romance in earlier Celtic myth. The novel also plays up the associations between Glastonbury and King Arthur's burial place of the island of Avalon, which have been present since the 20th century. At the novel's end, much of the city is flooded, in reference to the myth that held Glastonbury to be the original Avalon. The novel closes with a drowning John Geard looking to Glastonbury Tor (itself referred to repeatedly as the domain of the mythic Welsh spirit Gwyn-ap-Nudd) in hopes of seeing the Grail, followed by a short passage comparing the tower of the Tor and the Glastonbury Abbey to the persistence of the mythic and mystic in everyday life. The novel also contains numerous examples of anthropomorphisation, reflecting Powys' belief that even inanimate objects possessed soul. The sun, for example, is described as an enemy to the vicar Mat Dekker, while different trees are described as listening in to an early liaison between Mary and John Crow. Other passages refer to the spiritual extension of characters' will existing outside their bodies, particularly in the chapter \\"Nature Seems Dead\\" where a number of sleeping characters' 'spirits' move about the town. The novel also repeatedly refers to a Manichaean dualism in the nature of the First Cause, the closest equivalent to a Judeo-Christian God in the novel, though this dualism is seen as tied in with all of existence and is seen most strongly in the character of Owen Evans. These traits are found perhaps more strongly in A Glastonbury Romance than any of Powys' other novels, though his works were usually imbued with the author's own Celtic-based mystic beliefs described in detail in his personal letters and Autobiography. Lawsuit In 1934, Powys and his English publishers were successfully sued for libel by Gerard Hodgkinson, real-life owner of the Wookey Hole caves, who claimed that the character of Philip Crow had been based on him. The damages awarded crippled Powys financially, and he was forced to make substantial changes to the English edition of his next novel, which was initially published in America as Weymouth Sands (1934).Morine Krissd√≥ttir, Descents of Memory, pp. 301-2, 304-7, 320. The title of the English version was changed to Jobber Skald (1935) and all references to the real-life Weymouth were cut.Morine Krissd√≥ttir, Descents of Memory, pp. 307-8. Reception One of Powys's major novels, it was praised on publication by J. D. Beresford as \\"one of the greatest novels in the world\\".\\"Hotch-Potch Genius: John Cowper Powys\\".

They can be compared with a common loudspeaker, just that the diaphragm is missing. Instead, another object is used as a diaphragm. A shaker transmits low- frequency vibrations into various surfaces so that they can be felt by people. This is called tactile sound. Tactile transducers may augment or in some cases substitute for a subwoofer. One benefit of tactile transducers is they produce little or no noise, if properly installed, as compared with a subwoofer speaker enclosure. Applications A bass-shaker is meant to be firmly attached to some surface such as a seat, couch or floor. The shaker houses a small weight which is driven by a voice coil similar to those found in dynamic loudspeakers. The voice-coil is driven by a low-frequency audio signal from an amplifier; common shakers typically handle 25 to 50 watts of amplifier power. The voice coil exerts force on both the weight and the body of the shaker, with the latter forces being transmitted into the mounting surface. Tactile transducers may be used in a home theater, a video gaming chair or controller, a commercial movie theater, or for special effects in an arcade game, amusement park ride or other application. Related to bass shakers are a newer type of transducer referred to as linear actuators. These piston-like electromagnetic devices transmit motion in a direct fashion by lifting home theater seating in the vertical plane rather than transferring vibrations (by mounting within a seat, platform or floor). This technology is said to transmit a high-fidelity sound-motion augmentation, whereas \\"Shakers\\" may require heavy equalization and/or multiple units to approach a realistic effect. =Virtual reality= There are other products which employ hydraulic (long-throw) linear actuators and outboard motion processors for home applications as popularized in \\"virtual reality\\" rides. These products differ radically from tactile transducers in that they require the manual composition and synchronized playback of motion signals, in addition to the standard soundtrack that the motion is meant to accompany. Designs Various designs for tactile transducers have been presented since the 1960s, most of which fall under the \\"shaker\\" category. Shakers create a vigorous vibration by moving a mass (usually a magnet) which is bolted to a final mass (like a chair or couch). A simple example of this is the vibration available on a common cellphone. Another way of producing tactile sound uses \\"linear actuators\\", which move furniture (usually up and down), rather than shaking it. The main advantage of linear actuators is that they deliver actual motion (ground excursion), not just vibration. In the 2010s, tactile sound transducers have evolved to include higher frequencies and produce higher fidelity. The human tactile frequency range is from 1 Hz, very low frequency such as earthquakes, up to 5 kHz in some hearing impaired individuals. For most individuals 2 to 3 kHz is the upper threshold for tactile reception. These 2010s-era devices must have higher resolution than previous \\"shakers\\" to produce these frequencies. Most humans have tactile resolution to 2 Hz which is the smallest change in frequency that can be perceived. The primary use for this extended bandwidth is to reproduce the vibratory signature for musical instruments such as violins, guitars, the human voice or sound effects in movies (for example, the speeders in Star Wars). Also higher frequencies may be used to augment hearing through bone conduction, a consideration for people who have compromised their hearing from exposure to loud music. Tactile sound is often used to increase the realism of an artificial environment. For example, mounting a tactile sound transducer in a chair or couch in a home cinema or video game setup can give more of a sense of \\"being there\\". For such use, the transducer is often connected to the LFE channel of an A/V receiver. Tactile sound is often used in combination with a subwoofer so that low frequencies can be both felt and heard. To facilitate broadband tactile sound, all channels are summed to provide a full range signal to the transducer amplifier. Graphic equalizers can also be used to further modify the effect. In music For musical performance, drummers will often use a tactile sound transducer mounted on their drum stool so they can \\"feel\\" themselves playing, rather than using a more conventional stage monitor. The size and power of a stage monitor required to adequately reproduce low frequency drum sounds would be expensive and hard to transport, while a tactile sound transducer can be rather small and require much less power to get the job done. As well, sound engineers may prefer a tactile transducer over a loud, powerful subwoofer monitor cabinet, because a monitor speaker may produce a lot of stage volume. Nicolas Collins describes several tactile transducers, including some wide-range drivers, which are able to transmit a broader frequency spectrum. 51 - 53 The composer David Tudor used tactile transducers in his work Rainforest (1968). He used \\"Rolen-Star\\" wide-range drivers to create all kinds of different loudspeaker sculptures. The tactile transducers are attached to large objects such as metal buckets and bring these objects in vibration. The vibrations of these sculptures are then picked up by contact microphones and amplified through a common loudspeaker system. More recent examples can be found in the work of Sabrina Schroeder, 116 - 117 who places tactile transducers on bass drums. Lynn Pook attaches small tactile transducers on the bodies of the audience members 119 and Carola Bauckholt used in her piece Doppelbelichtung for violin 12 so-called violin loudspeakers. These consists of violins hanging from the ceiling, each with a small tactile transducer attached to them. In gaming Video Gaming enthusiasts have discovered that tactile transducers / bass shakers can bring their simulation rigs alive. Some manufacturers, like ButtKicker, target this market with basic entry level \\"Gamer\\" branded shakers. There are two ways to enhance the gaming experience with tactile. =Simple audio-based= At its simplest, the bass woofer signal is fed from the game into one or more shakers, just like in a home theater setup. The result is a satisfying increase in immersion to the game and the \\"feeling\\" of being there. =Telemetry-based rule-driven immersion= Immersion can be taken to a whole new level using a combination of tactile transducers and software like Simhub that can receive, interpret and react to telemetry information provided by games in real time. For example, many car racing simulation games provide a real-time feed of suspension travel, speed, revs, tire pressure, and much more! Software can then receive that data and use rules to send specific audio signals to specific amps driving different tactile transducers. Depending on how well the software is tuned, and the transducers are mounted, this can result in incredible immersion and the transmission of feelings of speed, cornering, acceleration, deceleration, bumps and much more. Since 2017 this telemetry based approach has inspired a growing group of enthusiasts to experiment with different tactile transducers, and exciters explore amplification options, and incorporate Vibration isolation theory and products.

Early life and business career Yip, an ethnic Indonesian Chinese of Hakka ancestry from Meixian, Guangdong, China was born as Jap Tek Lie in Medan, on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia in 1907. At that time Indonesia was the Dutch East Indies, a colony of the Netherlands. Teddy Yip studied in the Netherlands and took Dutch nationality. He moved to Hong Kong in the 1940s and began to build up his business empire which included travel agencies, hotels, casinos and trading companies. Yip spoke many languages including six Chinese variants (most notably Hakka being his native tongue, Mandarin and Cantonese due to his residence in Hong Kong and Macau), Dutch (through his life experience during the Dutch colonial rule and the owning of his Dutch citizenship), English, French, German, Malay (Indonesian) (since he was born and spent his childhood in Indonesia prior his move to the Netherlands for his studies) and Thai which helped him expand his businesses into property and finance. Yip started racing cars for fun in the 1950s at the wheel of a Toyopet Model SA. In 1962 he and several partners, including his brother-in-law Stanley Ho, formed the Sociedade de Turismo e Divers√µes de Macau with a monopoly to run all casino operations and many other leisure activities in Macau, including lotteries, ferries and hotels. Teddy Yip established the Casino Lisboa along with Stanley Ho (the brother of his wife Susie Ho) and their two other partners (Yip Hon and Henry Fok). The Sociedade de Turismo e Divers√µes de Macau transformed Macau into a major tourist destination. Yip was the force behind the Macau Grand Prix, a prestigious annual motor racing event in the streets of Macau often won by drivers who would go on to great success in Formula One. Motor racing In the early 1970s Yip met Sid Taylor, a racing team manager and former racing driver from Ireland. In 1974 Teddy Yip sponsored Australian driver Vern Schuppan in a Formula 5000 team managed by Taylor and in Formula One with Team Ensign. In 1975 he continued to sponsor Schuppan in races in America and for 1976 supported Alan Jones in the US Formula 5000 series, also establishing his Theodore Racing, run by Sid Taylor, who entered an Ensign in F1 with Patrick Tambay as the driver. After a difficult year in 1977, Yip commissioned Ron Tauranac to build him a Formula One car. The car was difficult to drive and Eddie Cheever failed to qualify in both Brazil and Argentina but Keke Rosberg took the car to a shock victory at the 1978 BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone, a non-championship race that was held in extremely wet conditions that year. Rosberg qualified for only one Grand Prix that year, in South Africa. The car was abandoned in mid-season. In America, Yip financially supported Dan Gurney's Eagle team. In 1979, Yip helped to fund Ensign but the car was not a success. The car was driven by Derek Daly, Patrick Gaillard, and Marc Surer but there were no points scored. At the end of 1978 and through 1979 Teddy also funded a British F1 programme with Walter Wolf Racing WR3, WR4 and WR6 for David Kennedy who finished runner up in the series. His British F1 programme also ran Desir√© Wilson in Wolf WR4 to a famous win at Brands Hatch in 1980. Kennedy moved to Shadow in 1980 with, initially, Stefan Johansson and later Geoff Lees as team mate but the team was chronically underfunded and using a very poorly engineered DN11 chassis. After a few races Yip took over ownership from founder Don Nichols and introduced a DN12 chassis which also proved a failure. After both cars failed to qualify for the French Grand Prix in June Yip closed down the Shadow team. Yip rethought his involvement in racing and ended most of his other activities in order to concentrate on F1. With Sid Taylor and Julian Randles he established Theodore Racing Ltd. and recruited designer Tony Southgate and team manager Jo Ram√≠rez. The new car was dubbed the TY01 and was driven by Tambay at the start of 1981. In the mid- season Tambay was lured away by Ligier and Yip gave the drive to Marc Surer. The same car was developed in 1982 and it became obvious that small teams could not easily survive in the turbo era. Yip merged Theodore with Ensign and used the Nigel Bennett-designed Ensign N183 design as a Theodore. The team hired drivers Johnny Cecotto and Roberto Guerrero but at the end of that season the team shut down and Mo Nunn moved to America, where he enjoyed great success as a race engineer through the 1980s and into the 1990s and eventually set up a successful team of his own in Champ Car. Yip had long run a team each year at the Macau GP and in 1983 was behind the switch from Formula Pacific rules to Formula Three rules. The result was a huge success and Theodore Racing has won the event many times, notably with Ayrton Senna in 1983. Yip reduced his involvement in motor racing sponsorship in the late 1980s and finally sold his share of his company in Macau to his brother-in-law. His son Teddy Yip Jr. revived the Theodore Racing brand in various single seater racing formulae. Death Teddy Yip died at the age of 96 in 2003. News of his death and the subsequent funeral received extensive coverage in television, radio and print media in South East Asia.

On an out route, the receiver will start running a fly pattern (i.e., running straight down the field toward the end zone) but, after a certain number of steps, will cut hard 90 degrees \\"to the outside\\", or toward the sideline, away from the quarterback.http://www.topwrtraining.com/how-to-run-an-out-route.html If the cut comes very quickly, usually after only a few steps, it is called a \\"quick out\\". Out routes generally allow a one-on-one match-up between the receiver and the defensive back who is guarding him, as safeties generally are concerned with helping out on long routes downfield or the center of the field. This route is used much more frequently near the end of each half or , when a team is running their two-minute drill to preserve time on the clock, because, as soon as the receiver catches the ball or after a short run after the catch, he should be able to get out of bounds, stopping the clock. It is a quick execution play; if the ball is thrown correctly usually a defensive player can't respond quickly enough to interfere. It is also often called in a 3rd-down situation where the full ten yards are needed. Out and in routes are the most difficult routes to cover in man-to-man coverage, but can be dangerous plays to run because, if the defender intercepts the pass, he will often have a clear path to the end zone.

Biography Timberg was born in New York City to a Jewish family originating in Austria, youngest son of Israel and Mary Timberg and brother of vaudeville performers Herman Timberg and Hattie Darling. He studied piano under Rubin Goldmark with hopes of becoming a classical performer; the death of his father in 1919, however, forced him to leave his studies and find work. Just 16, Sammy joined Herman's act as a straight man, and also began conducting the orchestra. To increase the family earnings, Herman also wrote material for other acts, including Georgie Price and Clark and McCullough (and, a few years later, Phil Silvers). In 1920 the Timbergs were hired by Chico Marx to develop a follow-up to the Marx Brothers hit revue Home Again after the failure of the 1918 Kahn/Swerling production Cinderella Girl. In February 1921 the Marx Brothers introduced On The Mezzanine which toured across the US and in Britain; it was written by Herman and managed by Hattie, while 18-year old Sammy led the orchestra and co-wrote the music. Sammy also found work with other performers and in 1929 supplied songs for Broadway revues Broadway Nights, Dutchess of Chicago, and The Street Singer, all choreographed by Busby Berkeley. He also worked for the Shuberts, and organized and led his own touring orchestra. Timberg was perhaps most famous for the music he wrote for cartoons while music director of the Fleischer Studios, such as Popeye, Betty Boop, and Superman. He also contributed songs to two Fleischer feature-length animated films, Gulliver's Travels and Mr. Bug Goes to Town. Possibly his best known and most-recorded song, It's a Hap-Hap-Happy Day, was a feature from Gulliver. He remained with the organization to compose shorts when the Fleischers were succeeded by Famous Studios, serving as the studio's musical director until Winston Sharples officially succeeded him in 1943. He composed and conducted the score for MGM recording of the Lionel Barrymore A Christmas Carol. He unsuccessfully managed the early career of Jackie Gleason, and wrote music for Gleason, Frank Sinatra, Eydie Gorm√©, and others until he retired in the 1960s.The Art and Inventions of Max Fleischer: American Animation Pioneer, Ray Pointer, , pp 130-131 In the early 1950s Timberg moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he died in 1992.

Fretter's first store was located on Telegraph Road just north of Interstate 96 in Redford, Michigan, and the main warehouse, warehouse store and company headquarters, was on Schoolcraft Road (I-96 Service Drive) in Livonia. Fretter expanded his operations throughout the midwest and New England by the 1970s.  History  The company's founder and spokesman, Ollie Fretter, became known in the Detroit area in the 1970s and 1980s by humorous TV commercials in which he promised, \\"I‚Äôll give you five pounds of coffee if I can't beat your best deal. The competition knows me. You should too!\\" When occasionally he had to make good on the whimsical offer, Fretter gave away one-pound cans of coffee that had been relabeled \\"net weight ‚Äî 5 pounds\\". The company paid its salespeople on a draw against commissions program, although they were paid spiffs instead of pure commission. Spiffs were calculated based on profit margin and other incentives, not based on the price of the product. Salespeople were not encouraged to sell the more expensive unit, but a model not carried by the competition which couldn't be directly price compared and therefore had a higher mark-up. Salespeople learned that the coin endings of the products directed them to which item to sell. Products with a .97 ending were high margin items and paid well; while .86 were not as profitable, and .75 were advertised items that paid very little. Clearance items were priced with repeating numbers like .66, .55, and .33 depending on the age of the item. Special order and hard to find items were priced with .71 endings and while they paid comparable to a .97 item a salesperson may get burned when the item was not in stock and/or delays in new stock arriving. Fretter maintained its marketing strategy as a low-cost retailer, even hiring outside research companies to compare prices with competitors and making that information available to sales people at their point-of-sale terminals. The move did little to sway public opinion since the chain sold higher end goods than its competitors but did not make that point clear in its advertising. While Fretter and its competitors both sold a brand, they rarely sold the same models within the brand. Fretter owned a small chain of mobile electronics retailers, DASH Concepts, that installed car audio, security, and other similar products. Serving Detroit and Cleveland areas it had its main warehouse in Dearborn, Michigan, in the same building as one of the Fretter stores. The Detroit electronics retailing market was upended when the largest company, Highland Superstores, ceased operation in 1993. Best Buy saw this as an opportunity to move into new territory, areas it previously felt were oversaturated by Highland and other major competitors like Fretter. Fretter management had been working to compete with the superstore model by becoming one of its own. It bought employee-owned Fred Schmid stores, giving the chain hold of markets in the mountain states. Fretter moved its corporate offices to Colorado and oversaw the merger from there. In 1993, Fretter also acquired their biggest competition of the time Silo Electronics, a company that had previously not turned a profit since the 1980s. This was an attempt by Fretter to compete with its new major competition, electronic superstores Circuit City and Best Buy, which were larger than Fretter's stores. The merger temporarily made Fretter the second largest retailer in this category, after Circuit City and larger than Best Buy, based on previous store sales, but Fretter immediately began closing redundant locations; where the company now had two or more stores in the same neighborhood. Fretter returned its main office to the Detroit area, to Brighton, Michigan. The company wanted to rebrand itself as YES! (Your Electronics Superstore) but this move did not make it to any of the stores; they all retained their original designations of Silo, Fretter, Fred Schmid, DASH Concepts, and other. The acquisition, assumption of Silo debt and lack of liquid assets, lead the company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, forcing the chain to close many locations. All Silo Electronics stores closed by 1995, with all Fretter locations closing by May 1996.Akre, Brian S. (September 27, 1995). \\"Home Electronics, Appliance Chain Fretter Inc.

At least 28 people are reported to have been killed and as many as 101 others were injured. The city is considered holy by Hindus and is one of the oldest cities in the world. Blasts Map of blast locations =Blast at the Temple= The blasts occurred nearly simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 at the crowded Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Hundreds of pilgrims were in temple as it was a Tuesday, believed to be particularly holy by the devotees of Lord Hanuman, a deity at the temple. The bomb was placed in a container near a gate at the temple where women usually sit. It claimed 10 lives and injured 40. =Blast at the station= One other blast followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station. It occurred in the waiting area next to the travel office. Initially another blast was reported inside the stationary Shiv Ganga Express bound for Delhi; however, this was later discounted. The Shiv Ganga Express departure was delayed by 2 hours, eventually arriving in Delhi 4 hours late but intact. Six bombs were reported defused from other areas in the city, including a restaurant frequented by foreigners, in the vicinity of the railway station. It claimed 11 lives and injured 20. Timing of the blasts It is estimated that the date and time of the explosions were selected for causing maximum damage. The CBSE and ISC Examinations (India's school leaving examinations) were in progress and therefore there were many students and worshippers at the temple when the bombs exploded during the Aarti ceremony. Tuesday was also a holy day of the deity at the temple. It is further conjectured that the bomb at the railway station was orchestrated to coincide with the throng of passengers waiting for Shiv Ganga express. Rescue and relief operations *The railway ministry announced ex-gratia of IN Rs to the next of kin of those who died in the explosion at the Cantonment railway station in Varanasi. *Seriously injured would be sanctioned IN Rs 25,000 each while those with minor injuries will get IN Rs 1,000 each. *The railway ministry would bear all expenses of food, medicine and accommodation of the injured persons during the period of treatment. Investigation Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant outfit, whose member was shot dead in an encounter with police near Lucknow on Wednesday, were prima facie behind the blasts in Varanasi, a senior Uttar Pradesh government official said in Varanasi on Wednesday. Uttar Pradesh, Chief Secretary, Mr. Sinha said bombs were made in Bihar. The material to make bombs was procured in Nepal which was then smuggled across the porous Indo- Nepal border. Official response Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the blasts and appealed for calm. A state of high alert was declared in India's major cities. Police were sent to all major places of worship in New Delhi. India's Cabinet Committee on Security met in emergency session.

Suspects A little known group calling itself the Lashkar-e Kahar/Qahab has claimed responsibility for the attacks. A spokesperson for the group who identified himself as Abdullah Jabbar alias Abu Feroz called a local news agency in Srinagar on Thursday morning to claim responsibility for the blasts and threatened similar attacks in other cities unless the government stopped its \\"catch and kill\\" campaign in Jammu and Kashmir. A staff of the TV channel said that Feroz spoke in Urdu with a heavy Punjabi accent. It is speculated that the bombings were carried out in retaliation of the arrest of a Lashkar-e- Toiba agent in Varanasi earlier in February 2006.Rediff ‚Äì 2 blasts rock Varanasi; 20 dead Some analysts see a connection between the bombings and Hindu-Muslim clashes in the city of Lucknow on 4 March 2006 that left four people dead.

It is also believed that these attacks were a part of a series which included an attack at the IISc, Bangalore and also at the Akshardham Temple, Gujarat.

Origins The first known Christmas Club started in 1909, when Merkel Landis, treasurer of the Carlisle (Pennsylvania) Trust Company, introduced the first Christmas savings fund. The Club attracted 350 customers who saved about $28 each, and the money was disbursed on December 1 of that year. The January 2, 1920 edition of the Belvidere, Illinois Daily Republican announced that the town's State Farmers Bank was encouraging parents to enroll their children in the Christmas Banking Club \\"to develop self-reliance and the saving habit\\". Promotion For decades, financial institutions competed for the holiday savings business, offering enticing premiums and advertising items such as tokens. The Dime Saving Bank of Toledo, Ohio, issued a brass token \\"good for 25 cents in opening a Christmas account\\" for 1922-1923. There were also numbered tokens issued by the Atlantic Country Trust Co. in Atlantic City, New Jersey, inscribed on the reverse: \\"Join our Christmas Club and Have Money When You Need It Most.\\" In the February 2006 issue of Forbes magazine, business writer James Surowiecki summarized the accounts' appeal: \\"The popularity of Christmas Club accounts isn't a mystery; if their money was in a regular account, people assumed they'd spend it.\\"Surowiecki, James. ‚ÄúBitter Money and Christmas Clubs.‚Äù Forbes.com.

Drawbacks Key drawbacks of Christmas Club accounts included low interest rates and a high number of restrictions, such as not allowing withdrawals unless fees were paid. Christmas Clubs later fell out of favor with consumers. Banks also incurred high costs in maintaining the accounts. According to Dennis Halpin, the CEO for the Capital Communications Federal Credit Union, the union had 3,500 Christmas Club members in 1984. Each member required a check to be produced, signed, collated, and mailed, only for 70 percent to be returned to the bank to be deposited in another account.

In 1999, ITPO asked IAL to vacate the land, at which point the private firm sought legal arbitration with ITPO to continue with Appu Ghar. Meanwhile, with the Supreme Court of India urgent needing land for extension along with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation for construction of the Delhi Metro's Pragati Maidan metro station, the Government allocated the land to both the parties. In 2007, the Supreme Court finally ratified the Government's decision to hand over the land from IAL, paving the way for Appu Ghar's eventual closure on 17 February 2008.

It was the band's first album. At this early point in their career, several of the band's songs resembled those of their previous band The Broadways, being political in nature (such as \\"Kevin Costner's Casino\\"), something which they later almost completely phased out in favor of personal/introspective lyrics. Singer/bassist Brendan Kelly sings almost all of the lead vocals on this album, whereas on later works he and singer/guitarist Chris McCaughan moved towards singing lead on roughly equal numbers of songs; and on Oh! Calcutta! tended to share vocal duties within songs, by singing together and/or alternating lines. The album was recorded in one day at Scientific Recordings by Mike Giampa and Andy. The album was never properly mixed due to the band running out of money while recording it. Although loved by hardcore fans, Brendan Kelly has stated that this is his least favorite Lawrence Arms album, calling it \\"a terrible representation of our band.\\" The album was released on vinyl for the first time in 2009 on Asian Man Records, with all new artwork. Song information \\"An Evening of Extraordinary Circumstance\\" was the first song ever written for the band. Brendan Kelly wrote it while on a bus. It was written at a time when he didn't have a band or any direction, and was feeling completely helpless. Kelly has stated that the song still sums up some of his deepest resentments towards himself. He also stated that it's his favorite song on the album. They used the title of this song to be the name of their live tenth anniversary show DVD, released on Fat Wreck Chords. A homemade music video was made for the song. It consisted of random shots of Chicago and the band. It was released on the Asian Man Records DVD, 10 Minutes to Ogikubo Station. It was also released on the live DVD of the same name on Fat Wreck Chords. It remains the only song from the album regularly included in their live act. \\"Kevin Costner's Casino\\" is about actor, Kevin Costner buying land that belonged to the Lakota People in Deadwood, South Dakota, to add extensions to his casinos. \\"A Guided Tour of Chicago\\" is an ode to the homeless people living in Chicago. \\"Take One Down and Pass It Around\\" is about drinking and gambling. \\"Someday We're All Gonna Weigh 400 Ibs\\" is about technology taking over human interaction, written from a satirical viewpoint. \\"The Northside, the L&L;, and Any Number of Crappy Apartments\\" mentions the L&L; Tavern in its title, which is a bar located in Chicago. The song is about questioning the lifestyle they were living at the time. \\"Smokestacks\\" is a song about the environment, and thinking that nature will soon be replaced by smokestacks, concrete, and power plants. \\"Detention\\" was about a crazy dream that Brendan had. \\"Uptown Free Radio\\" is a reference to the apartment that Chris and Brendan lived in. On certain days they could hear local music being played across the street, from their porch. \\"Eighteen Inches\\" is an introspective anthem about the harsh winters in Chicago, and the hypocrisy of pontification.

Each year, the organization holds a four-day debate conference on Family Day weekend for youth ages 14 to 21 from Ontario, Canada. The organization has roots within the United Church of Canada dating back to 1907. The first session of the Older Boys' Parliament met in the Ontario Legislative Building at Queen's Park in Toronto in January 1925. As a result, the OYP, as successor to the Older Boys' Parliament, is one of the oldest youth parliaments in Canada. Gordon Lapp of Brighton served as the first Premier. In 1969, the Older Boys' Parliament was succeeded by the OYP and is now a non- denominational Christian-based organization that is open to participants of all faiths. It combines components of parliament-style debate, social and leadership development activities and exploration of spirituality. The debate is modeled after the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, with mock legislation written by members of the youth cabinet on current issues facing youth in Canada. Social activities include two dances and a formal banquet, secret friends, and team-building games. The spiritual side of OYP is addressed through open nightly discussion on the theme chosen for that year and attendance at the host church's worship service.  Organization  OYP has long operated as a non-denominational organization, although it maintains a spiritual element and relationship with the United Church as reflected in activities such as vespers. The Ontario Youth Parliament is overseen by a registered charitable organization, the executive of which is styled as a \\"senate\\". Delegates attend the annual session to debate legislation prepared by the cabinet, which is composed of delegates to the session. = Senate = While the cabinet plans and runs each year's parliamentary session, the senate monitors the association's long term needs; specifically, maintaining policies and procedures, managing finances, and overseeing public relations. The senate is composed of the cabinet and any other interested parties, typically OYP alumni. To ensure that the organization remains \\"for youth, by youth,\\" the cabinet always forms the majority of the senate. To perform the duties of the senate between meetings, a seven member board of directors is elected in rotation at senate meetings and sittings of OYP. = Cabinet = The cabinet is composed of youth eligible to be delegates. The cabinet has the task of organizing the logistic, fiscal and legislative components of the parliament. In order to facilitate this task, cabinet meets four times between each year's session. To select and lead this group, a five member executive is elected by the delegates at each annual sitting. This group consists of the Premier, the Leader of the Opposition (colloquially known as the Lofo), the Registrar and Minister of Finance, the Minister of Individual Discipleship, and the Government House Leader. = Delegates = The third group is composed of youth aged 14‚Äì21 whom are collectively referred to as delegates. Delegates attend only the main event on Family Day weekend and, along with members of cabinet, participate in debate over the legislation. = Annual sessions = Group photo for Ontario Youth Parliament 2013 Ontario Youth Parliament is held each year from Friday to Monday on the Family Day weekend in February. Sessions are open to the public. The structure of OYP matches that of constitutional tradition of the House of Commons, with a government, opposition, speaker and pages. The parliament is traditionally opened by a person acting as lieutenant-governor, a role that has been played by figures such as Moderator Robert McClure and Governor General Roland Michener. Legislation is prepared throughout the year by the cabinet, usually centred around topics relevant to young people. Delegates at OYP have debated controversial political issues such as gay rights, environmental regulations and aboriginal autonomy. At the session, bills are presented and debated at several different sittings throughout the weekend. OYP is nonpartisan, which means that each delegate can express their opinion and vote freely. At the end of each debate, all delegates vote on whether the legislation should be passed or defeated. Any legislation passed by the majority is sent to the appropriate government offices in Toronto and Ottawa.  History  OYP is the successor organization of the Older Boys' Parliament of Ontario, which began in 1921 as a youth program within the United Church of Canada. The Older Boys' Parliament movement, which began in Western Canada and moved eastward, was an extension of the Trail Rangers and TUXIS programs of various churches. Among the early participants of Older Boys' Parliaments was Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who later recalled: \\"Few of the opportunities open ... for self-improvement and participation for a full role as contributing members of the Canadian community are more rewarding than participation in the ... [youth] parliament.\\" Other notable supporters were MP Douglas Abbott and Ontario MPPs Irwin Haskett and Claude Bennett. =TUXIS= The first model parliament was organized in 1912 by the United Church as the TUXIS Boys' Parliament. In October 1918 the Trail Rangers and TUXIS programs were implemented by Taylor Statten and Wallace Forgie under the covering name of \\"Canadian Standard Efficiency Training\\" (CSET). The four main focuses of the program were the intellectual, physical, spiritual and social aspects of boyhood. Within a decade, thousands of boys were participating in leadership training courses, summer camps and other activities run through CSET programs in a number of provinces. By 1928, there were over 2,000 registered groups with a total enrollment of roughly 30,000 boys across Canada. The TUXIS Boys' Parliament held in Ontario in 1917 officially transformed CSET into the Trail Rangers and TUXIS program. Three years later, the National Boys' Work Board of the Religious Education Council of Canada was established as an interfaith group composed of representatives of the Anglican and United Churches as well as the YMCA. The Ontario Boys' Work Board sponsored the TUXIS and subsequent Older Boys' Parliament programs throughout the mid-20th century. Taylor Statten believed that boys themselves should be given the responsibility of a leadership role in making decisions about the CSET program and that adult advisors should not impose their opinions and ideas on the young people. Out of this basic philosophy, the concept of Older Boys' Parliament was born. = Older Boys' Parliament = The Older Boys' Parliaments were given the authority to legislate for the CSET program and to become the vehicle of government and planning. They became one of the most important phases of the CSET movement, with party leaders citing extensive involvement in the Trail Rangers and TUXIS programs. At annual parliamentary sessions, boys were selected as representatives of their local churches and then gathered to work out ideas for the CSET program and debate the issues of the day. Throughout the 20th century, the method of selecting delegates varied from boys running in elections to being hand-picked from denominational groups. As well as providing leadership training and a chance to look at issues from a Christian point of view, these mock parliaments gave youth a chance to see other parts of their province and their country. The first parliamentary session in Ontario was the TUXIS Boys' Parliament held in 1917. In the following decades, the movement grew to include eight organizations across the country. In 1924 the Ontario Older Boys' Parliament opposed a suggestion that a national Boys' Parliament be convened because of expenses and the difficulty of getting representation from all over Canada. The Older Boys' Parliaments were very much part of a Christian milieu. Sessions included boys from Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian and United Churches, and a significant portion of debate focused on church programs. They drew criticism for purporting to represent an entire province, using legislative and administrative buildings for annual sessions, and then excluding boys whose religious scruples made it impossible to participate. By the 1930s, Older Boys' Parliaments had loosened their ties with TUXIS and young men from outside the United Church began to attend, although funding continued to come from Christian sources such as the United Church and The Salvation Army. In 1958 the Ontario Older Boys' Parliament began to work amongst boys outside of the church groups to which it had previously confined its activities. More than just a governing body for the CSET program, the Older Boys' Parliament became regarded as an organization that facilitated \\"a real understanding of the meaning of democracy,\\" teaching a respect for democratic values such as tolerance for dissent and the protection of the individual. For example, the Saskatchewan Older Boys' Parliament urged members to participate actively in politics as informed and open-minded voters. The leaders of the Older Boys' Parliament movement saw themselves as training \\"the leaders of tomorrow.\\" Alumni from the 1960s cited their involvement with the organization as the spark for an interest in world issues, as well as the foundation of their communication skills. = Ontario Youth Parliament = By the 1950s, the idea of cooperating with girls' groups such as Canadian Girls in Training or allowing girls to join the organization began to emerge. In 1968, the decision was made to open the Ontario Older Boys' Parliament to both boys and girls. This was a contentious issue at the time. In that same year, delegates of the Saskatchewan Older Boys' Parliament argued both for and against the involvement of women in parliament, defeating a resolution to include girls for a one-year trial basis. The same debate was occurring in the British Columbia and Alberta Older Boys' Parliaments as they sought to meet societal changes. OYP became known for building leadership skills, teaching parliamentary procedure and exposing young people to new ideas. OYP continues challenged delegates to debate ethical and moral issues that they had previously not considered. Before the introduction of Family Day as a provincial holiday in 2008, OYP was held on the first weekend of March break. In the late 20th century attendance was around 150 delegates, and remained at that level until decreasing abruptly in the years preceding 2006.  Regional parliaments  Between 1980 and 2006, OYP held five regional parliaments across Ontario each year. Though each regional parliament was distinct in its traditions, the Ontario Youth Parliament Association regulated each parliament through the Regionals Act. The original five regionals were: South Western Ontario Regional Parliament (SWORP); South Central Ontario Parliament for Youth (SCOPY); Central Ontario Regional Parliament (CORP); Eastern Ontario Regional Youth Parliament (EORYP); and, Northern Ontario Regional Parliament (NORP). Due to low registration, SCOPY and CORP planned to hold their 2005 session jointly as South Central Ontario Regional Parliament for Youth (SCORPY), however, the session never occurred. EORYP was the only regional to occur in 2006 and became OYP's last regional parliament.

In a lease- option, a property owner and tenant agree that, at the end of a specified rental period for a given property, the renter has the option of purchasing the property. A lease option is different from a lease purchase contract, in that a lease purchase binds both parties to the sale, whereas in a lease- option the buyer has the option but the seller does not. Residential example The example below describes a typical lease-option for residential properties; commercial lease-options are typically more complicated. The contract is typically between two parties: the tenant (also called the lessee or tenant-buyer), and the landlord (lessor), who owns or has the right to lease or dispose of the property. In order to have a valid option the tenant- buyer must in most cases provide \\"valuable consideration\\" (a fee) for the option. Generally, sellers will ask for as much as possible--often around 3‚Äì5% of the purchase price. The tenant-buyer usually will want to provide as little as possible--even a token amount of $100 represents \\"consideration.\\" The option gives the tenant the right (but not the obligation) to purchase the property at a later date. The lease option only binds the seller to sell, it does not bind the buyer to buy. That makes it a \\"unilateral\\" or one-way agreement. In contrast, a lease-purchase is a bilateral, or two-way, agreement. The basic elements of a lease-option are: 1. Buyer purchases the option. The parties agree to what the cost of the option is. As noted above, it can range from a token amount to 5% (or more) of the value of the property. The option fee usually is non-refundable. That is, if the tenant-buyer fails to exercise the option, the money remains with the seller. It is not refunded. The reason: The option fee is not a deposit. The option fee has been used to purchase something of value: the option. 2. The parties agree to a purchase price. It can be decided that the price will be the appraised value at the time the option is exercised. Generally, however, the purchase price is agreed upon at the inception of the option. 3. The length in residential real estate is typically 1-3 years. However, it is often unwise for the tenant-buyer to agree to a short period of time (often 2 years or less). The tenant-buyer often is expecting that the property will appreciate in value, particularly if the agreed-upon purchase price is equal to or higher than the fair market value at the time of the inception of the option. Perhaps even more important, often the tenant-buyer has credit or other financial issues preventing him/her from immediately purchasing. The option period is used to strengthen the tenant-buyer's credit, amass rent credits, and position him/herself to purchase. That often can take several years. 4. How much the monthly lease payment is, whether any of the lease payment is to be credited towards the purchase price reducing the purchase amount. Often, the monthly lease payment is equal to or slightly above the fair market rent of the property. And while it's fully negotiable, a credit in the range of 15%-25% is often offered. So, for example, if fair market rent for that unit would be $1,000, the seller might charge $1,100 with $200 of that being credited toward the purchase price. 5. Whether the tenant-buyer will occupy the property or whether the tenant/buyer has the right to sub lease or the right to sell the option. In most cases, the tenant-buyer occupies the property. Sellers will generally seek to make that one of the terms of the agreement. 6. An investor may acquire a distressed property with a lease option and make improvements to the property. Then the investor can sell the option to a buyer that is willing to pay the new market value for a profit. It is a common financing technique with investors. However, it is riskier than other methods the investor could use for controlling the property. The risks include the seller's inability to transfer clear title when the investor seeks to exercise the option. In that case, the investor will have made improvements (sometimes substantial) to a property he/she doesn't own and may not be able to acquire. If the investor is considering anything more than cosmetic enhancements, he/she might consider another method of control such as a land trust or acquiring the property using what's called a \\"subject to\\" (or Sub 2) transaction. 6.a An example: Seller has a property that needs considerable amount of work. Retail buyers typically cannot get financing or have too much to choose from to bother with physically distressed properties. Investor enters into a lease option agreement for let‚Äôs say $100,000, rehabs the property with about $20,000 and now the market value is approximately $135,000 the investor can sell the right to purchase for $35,000 and the new buyer would close with the original seller for $100,000 6.b Another example: A buyer buys the same property and uses his/her own money to rehab and may use rehab money towards the down payment. This allows the buyer to NOT have to come with a large down payment and rehab money. Everything functions like a lease except there is a schedule when the buyer can decide to purchase the property. The terms of the lease have to be negotiated also. These include items typically found in leases: maintenance, utilities, taxes, pets, how many occupants, insurance, ability to make modifications to the property, and so on. One note: Maintenance terms in a lease-option often differ from those in a standard lease. In a typical lease, often the owner is responsible for all repairs, except--sometimes--for a $50-$100 per incident deductible. Basically, the owner is responsible for virtually all repairs. In a lease-option, often a greater burden for repairs is shifted to the tenant-buyer. During the term of the lease option, the tenant makes lease payments to the landlord for the use of the property with the terms mutually agreed. At the end of the contract, the tenant has the option to purchase the property outright. The tenant does so by going out and getting a mortgage. Excess credit may also be applied towards the eventual purchase of the property, or towards the down payment for a mortgage (CAUTION, the buyer and seller can agree to whatever they want, but when the buyer goes to get permanent financing the bank has guidelines to what can be applied towards the down payment or the purchase. Typically banks only allow an amount that is above and beyond market rent to be considered for a down payment.) In that case, the lease-option works as an automatic savings plan for the tenant. This down payment is applied as part of the \\"option consideration fee\\"; in the arena of lease option purchasing this is a fee charged for the right to purchase the property. Reasons for using a lease option Buyers # Buyer is relocating and may need to sell a property in another area before the buyer can qualify to purchase the new home. # Buyer may have had some credit issues that can be resolved during the option period. # Buyer may have started a new business and otherwise qualifies and can afford the payments. # Buyer may not have enough funds for a downpayment. # Buyer is relocating and is unfamiliar with the new area. He/she wants to \\"get a feel\\" for the area--safety, school quality, convenience, etc. # Buyer is seeking a VA loan and the property does not meet VA appraisal guidelines. Buyer agrees to make the needed repairs during the lease term to allow the property to meet these specifications. In the event of non-payment, it may be possible for the seller to remove the tenants through eviction, which is likely to be cheaper than foreclosure on a mortgaged property. The lease-option may also require less money up front, while a mortgage might require a substantial down payment from the tenant. If the tenant does not exercise the option to purchase the property by the end of the lease, then generally any up front option money along with any monies that the tenant paid in addition to the market rental rate for this option may be retained by the owner depending on the agreement. This might occur if the tenant no longer wishes to purchase the property, or if the tenant wishes to purchase the property but is unable to obtain the financing required to do so. Seller A lease-option allows the seller to sell a property that they may not have otherwise been able to sell. In many cases a seller can net more money when offering terms to a buyer. Sellers can often avoid paying a Realtor fee by using a lease-option agreement (as they have already found the buyer themselves). There is an expression, ‚ÄúPrice or terms, pick one;‚Äù sellers may be able to sell for a better price (or sell the property period) by offering attractive terms to the buyer(s). For the buyer to get a favorable price the terms usually have to favor the seller. If the buyer defaults and the contracts are drafted properly then there is an automatic tenant landlord relationship. All valuable considerations are typically surrendered and then it would be an eviction. Some forms of lease-option agreements have been criticized as predatory. For example, sometimes lease-options are offered to tenants who cannot realistically expect to ever exercise the option to purchase. Sometimes the lease-option period is for such a brief amount of time (6 months, for example) that the tenant-buyer has little chance to repair his/her credit, save money for a down payment, or address whatever other problems exist.

Though the estate lies largely within the boundaries of North Somerset it is maintained by Bristol City Council, and has been publicly owned since 1959. The park contains horse riding and mountain biking trails, and is protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its ecology. The mansion house is now a conference centre.Bristol City Council: Ashton Court Estate Stoke Park is Bristol's newest park, acquired by Bristol City Council in 2011 and occupying a prominent position alongside the M32 motorway. Parks and open spaces in the central area The Centre Promenade is a paved, largely pedestrianised area built over the culverted River Frome. Known locally as the Centre,BBC Bristol, 7 February 2011 many local bus services terminate here. Castle Park is adjacent to the Broadmead and Cabot Circus shopping centres and the Floating Harbour. The park was created after wartime bombing damaged much of the pre-war shopping area which stood here. The ruined shells of two churches, St Peter and St Mary le Port, still stand in the park (with the aid of concrete reinforcements) and the foundations of Bristol Castle are also a feature. There are small formal gardens around St Peter's church, which is maintained as a war memorial. Bristol City Council has confirmed its intention to redevelop the area around St Mary-le-Port church. The project area includes a part of Castle Park to the west of St Peter's Church. To the west of the city centre lie Berkeley Square and Brandon Hill. At the summit of Brandon Hill, the Cabot Tower commemorates John Cabot, a pioneer who sailed in 1497 from Bristol to Newfoundland. Brandon Hill is steep and is divided into informal gardens, a small nature reserve and open grassland. The Avon Wildlife Trust headquarters are beside the park. Surrounded with high wrought-iron railings to the northwest of Broadmead shopping centre, St James' Park is a small former churchyard divided by a sunken walkway which links Broadmead to St James' Church and Bristol bus station. West of the city centre between Bristol Cathedral and the Council House is College Green, a popular meeting place for street sports enthusiasts. Queen Square is a large Georgian square south of the city centre. In 1936 the Square was bisected diagonally by Bristol's inner circuit road. Traffic has now been diverted, and the restored Square has received a number of awards including a Green Flag Award, the Landscape Institution Landscape and Heritage Award. King Square (restored in 1993), Brunswick Square and Portland Square are also Georgian and lie to the north of the city centre.

Description  Rather than taking the item home and then repaying the debt on a regular schedule, as in most installment plans or hire purchases, the layaway customer does not receive the item until it is completely paid for. There is sometimes a fee associated, since the seller must \\"lay\\" the item \\"away\\" in storage until the payments are completed. Because there is little risk involved for the seller, layaway can be readily offered to those with bad credit. If the transaction is not completed, the item is returned to stock; the customer's money may be returned in whole, returned less a fee, or forfeited entirely. The main advantage of layaway is that no interest is charged. However, the seller will be reinvesting the payments into ventures (usually the business itself) with an ROI at or above the risk free rate, which is effectively interest forfeited to the seller. In addition, the price is fixed, availability is guaranteed by reserving the item in stock, and an item being purchased as a gift can be kept secret. Consumers may also gain a sense of living within their means. However, consumers face potential financial loss in the case where a retailer declares bankruptcy prior to collecting the item.  History  Layaway became common during the Great Depression of the 1930s. It was widely withdrawn during the 1980s,The Economist, (Jan. 10, 2009) U.S. print edition, p. 31. as the ubiquity of credit cards decreased its utility. Wal-Mart announced in September 2006 that it would discontinue layaway service in all its stores, citing the decrease in demand and a rise in cost of implementation. However, in September 2011, Wal-Mart resumed the service in the United States due to the new financial difficulties imposed by the economy and the increased constraints on consumer credit. During the 2012 season, many retailers were heavily advertising their layaway service and offering it for free (or effectively free) if all conditions were met. In contrast, Kmart has been providing layaway in the United States for over forty years, and was at one time the only major national discount retailer offering the service. Other large retailers offering layaway programs include Burlington Coat Factory, Marshalls, Sears, and T.J. Maxx. In Canada it is available from many businesses including local bike shops, jewellers and adventure holidays.  Variations  Online layaway allows consumers to purchase items through scheduled deductions from a checking account. Online layaway simplifies layaway for both merchant and consumer by removing the costly, time-consuming storage and bookkeeping processes. Layaways remain at the distribution center during the layaway period instead of taking up valuable retail warehouse space. Just as consumers used layaway payment plans to purchase products at brick and mortar stores in the past, they can also use layaway to pay for online products and services which serves as an alternative budgeting tool and a means to avoid debt and it can help consumers reserve a product that is hard to get or not always available due its high demand and popularity. Products and services that have layaway offerings online vary from netbooks to home gyms and from concert tickets to layaway vacations. Many stores offer layaway during the Christmas season, and it has been a tradition for some individuals to make holiday layaway donations, thus releasing the purchased items to the layaway participant.\\"Anonymous ‚ÄòLayaway Angels‚Äô Return to Pay Off Strangers‚Äô Balances\\" (Dec. 21, 2012) Yahoo! Finance Guaranteed consumer funding is a type of credit similar to layaway, which allows consumers to purchase items on a payment plan regardless of their credit history.

Another sketch of the Stronsay beast. The Stronsay Beast was a large carcass or globster that washed ashore on the island of Stronsay (at the time spelled Stronsa), in the Orkney Islands, Scotland, after a storm on 25 September 1808. The carcass measured 55 ft (16.8 m) in length, but as part of the tail was apparently missing, it was estimated the animal was longer than that.(Wernerian Society Notes, 1808‚Äì1810, Library, Royal Museum, Edinburgh) The Natural History Society (Wernerian Society) of Edinburgh could not identify the carcass and decided it was a new species, probably a sea serpent. The Scottish naturalist Patrick Neill gave it the scientific name Halsydrus pontoppidani (Pontoppidan's sea-snake) in honor of Erik Pontoppidan, who described sea serpents in a work published half a century before. Later, the anatomist Sir Everard Home in London dismissed the measurement, declaring it must have been around 36 ft (11 m), and deemed it to be a decayed basking shark (basking sharks can take on a 'pseudo plesiosaur' appearance during decomposition). In 1849, Scottish professor John Goodsir in Edinburgh came to the same conclusion. The Stronsay Beast (known locally as the Stronsay monster) was measured by three witnesses (one was a carpenter and the other two were farmers). It was 4 ft (1.2 m) wide and had a circumference of about 10 ft (3.1 m). It had three pairs of 'paws' or 'wings'. Its skin was smooth when stroked head to tail and rough when stroked tail to head. Its fins were edged with bristles and it had a 'mane' of bristles all down its back. The bristles glowed in the dark when wet. Its stomach contents were red.

Founded in 1904, The Hatchet is the second-oldest newspaper in Washington, DC, only behind The Washington Post.GW Hatchet - About Us The Hatchet is often ranked as one of the best college newspapers in the United States and has consistently won awards from the Society of Professional Journalists and from the Associated Collegiate Press. Alumni of the GW Hatchet include numerous Pulitzer Prize winners, Emmy Award winners, politicians, news anchors, and editors of major publications. History The paper derives its name from the story of U.S. President George Washington (founding father of the university) involving his chopping down a cherry tree with a hatchet. The first edition of the GW Hatchet was published on 5 October 1904. In 1993, The GW Hatchet was incorporated as an independent 501(c)(3) non-profit, and the paper has been editorially and financially independent of the University since then. It is run by a board of directors composed of Hatchet editors, former staff members, a GW student, a GW professor and professionals in the media industry. Daily operations are overseen by the Editor-in-Chief. All business and editorial positions are filled by current GW students and the Editor-in-Chief serves as the corporation's president. In 1998, The Hatchet launched its website, which has won many awards including a National Pacemaker Award in 2006 and 2010. For many years, the University only charged the paper $1 in rent for their fully controlled townhouse in Washington, D.C. but began charging monthly rent at reduced rates as of 2006. In 2012, The Hatchet moved out of the University owned townhouse at 2140 G St. NW and into their own building at 2148 F St. NW. In 2017, The Hatchet sold the building on F St. and began renting from the University again at 609 21st St. NW. In March 2015, the nonprofit real estate arm of The Hatchet sued the city of Washington, D.C. in D.C. Superior Court over a disputed property tax bill of $17,000, arguing that a request for a property tax exemption had been wrongfully denied (under D.C. law, schools, colleges and universities are exempt from property taxes). The city itself took the stance that neither The Hatchet nor its real estate arm qualify as educational organizations under D.C. law. As of December 2016 the lawsuit is still ongoing. Organization The newspaper is produced by Hatchet Publications, Inc., an independent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation. The publication's mission statement is \\"to follow, educate, and inform members of The George Washington University and Foggy Bottom communities.\\" It also serves as the newspaper of record for the University's archives. The GW Hatchet publishes 2,000 copies every Monday throughout the school semesters and a special freshman orientation issue during the summer recess.

It is situated in the upper Emmental between Bern and Lucerne. It has about 9,000 inhabitants and is the most important market place in the region. It is set among rolling hills. The average temperature is , and the average precipitation is . The village is one of the sunniest in Switzerland, with practically no fog.  History  Memorial to Klaus Leuenberger, a leader of the farmers' uprising Aerial view from 600 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1927) There are no signs of human inhabitants before the German migration in about the 11th century. The first mention of the name Langnau (German lange Au or Lanngnouw meaning long pasture/meadow) dates to 1139. In 1246 it was mentioned as Langenowe. Like other towns in the Emmental, Langnau was not built along the river because of the danger of flooding. Instead, it was built on higher ground along one of the streams flowing into the Emme. The earliest noble landowners seem to have been the Kyburg family. A fort was erected on the Spitzenegg hill in Gohl by the barons of Spitzenberg. This fortification was sold to the sons of Rudolf von Habsburg in 1300. A Benedictine monastery was established in Trub in 1130, and it held ownership of large tracts of land. After the Battle of Sempach in 1386, where the Swiss Confederation defeated the troops led by Duke Leopold III of Habsburg, the Bernese established their authority over the area. However, there were continued clashes with the authorities in Lucerne. In 1528, Bern imposed the Protestant religion on the entire region. In 1653, there was a farmers' insurrection due to the economic crisis after the end of the Thirty Years' War and the persecution of the Anabaptists (Mennonites). The insurrection was put down, and persecution continued until about 1730. Many Anabaptists left the area to settle in the Jura mountains. In the 18th century, Langnau was an important center of the canvas and cheese trades. It was larger than any other town in the area, including Burgdorf. The railroad reached Langnau in 1864 from Bern, and continued to Lucerne in 1875. With the opening of the Gotthard line in 1882, the line through Langnau became the fastest access route to the south until the opening of the L√∂tschberg Tunnel in 1913.

It first appears in the 17th century as nunch'≈≠i (ÁúºÂã¢ in Chinese characters), meaning \\"eye force/power\\".\\"‚ÄòÎààÏπò‚ÄôÎäî 17ÏÑ∏Í∏∞ Ï≤òÏùå ‚ÄòÎààÏ∏º(ÁúºÂã¢)‚ÄôÎ°ú ÎÇòÌÉÄÎÇúÎã§.\\" \\"Nunchi first appeared as nunch'≈≠i (Áúº Âã¢). in the 17th century.\\" In Western culture, nunchi could be described as the concept of emotional intelligence. It is of central importance to the dynamics of interpersonal relationships. Nunchi is literally translated as \\"eye-measure\\". It is closely related to the broader concept of paralanguage, however nunchi also relies on an understanding of one's status relative to the person with whom they're interacting. It can be seen as the embodiment of skills necessary to communicate effectively in high context culture. The concept of nunchi, and one's abundance or lack thereof, forms the basis of many common expressions and idioms. For example, a socially clumsy person can be described as nunchi eoptta (ÎààÏπò ÏóÜÎã§), meaning \\"absence of nunchi.\\" ÎààÏπò Nunchi is briefly defined as the high social sensitivity of Koreans which basically means they are able to ascertain others moods by being around them and talking to them. They are sensitive to what others say indirectly, because they want to maintain harmony. They do this by the use of the skill named \\"nunchi\\" which literally means eye measure in Korean, they sense someone's \\"kibun\\", Kibun is a Korean word which relates to mood, current feelings, and the state of mind. Facilitating nunchi, encouraging the use of this skill, is expected to result in rich understanding. It is of central importance to the dynamics of interpersonal relationships. With nunchi, Koreans are using non- verbal cues to convey emotion and meaning through various means, including voice pitch and volume as well as intonation. Nunchi also relies heavily on an understanding of one's status relative to the person with whom one is interacting. Because Korea, as with other high-context cultures caters toward in-groups that have similar experiences and expectations and from which inferences are drawn, many things are left unsaid here. The culture does the explaining, in effect. Both Kibun and Nunchi are very difficult concepts for non-Koreans to get the hang of and they will generally be forgiven for their ignorance of these concepts and consequent rude behavior, especially if they are high on the status ladder. However, one gains more than one loses by trying to understand and, as much as possible, behaving according to these rules of behavior. In Korea, personal relations frequently take precedence over business. In order to be successful, it is vital to establish good, personal relationships based on mutual trust and benefit Koreans judge this by Nunchi to get a base understanding of the individual they just met. Korean business culture is firmly grounded in respectful rapport and in order to establish this, it is essential to have the right introduction to approach the company. Koreans will use Nunchi to make sure the right approach is being used, often through a mutual friend or acquaintance at the appropriate level. Koreans spend a significant amount of time developing and fostering personal contacts. Therefore, time should be allocated for this process, particularly during the first meeting, which is frequently used to simply establish rapport and build trust. The phrase ÎààÏπò ÏûàÎã§ (nunchi itda) refers to someone who's quick witted, can understand the situation quickly, or has common sense. Another way to say this is ÎààÏπò Îπ†Î•¥Îã§ (nunchi ppareuda) ‚Äì to have quick nunchi. In Korean, the phrase ÎààÏπò ÏóÜÎã§ (nunchi eoptta) refers to someone that is clueless, someone that doesn't know what's going on, or simply doesn't have any common sense basically it is the exact opposite of nunchi or when someones nunchi is lacking.

It belongs to Salzkammergut Mountains, a range of the Northern Limestone Alps. The mountain is one of the Salzburg Hausberge, a popular recreational area offering picturesque views over the city and the Berchtesgaden Alps in the west. On the top of the mountain is the widely visible Gaisberg Transmitter. Geography The mountain is one of the foothills of the Osterhorn Group between the Lammertal valley and the Wolfgangsee; forming the eastern rim of the Salzburg Basin. The western slopes with the K√ºhberg spur extend to the Salzburg city limits, the adjacent parts belong to the neighbouring Koppl and Elsbethen municipalities. Since 1988 a small part of the woodland is designated as a protected area. The Gaisberg has been a popular destination for daytrippers from Salzburg already in the 18th century. From 1887 until 1928 a rack railway, the Gaisbergbahn, provided easy access from the city to the top of the mountain until it was replaced in 1929 by a road. Today a public bus route starting from the Mirabellplatz square links a parking lot on the summit plateau, a starting point for winter sport, hiking, mountain biking, and paragliding to the city centre. The Gaisberg Transmitter, a high FM and TV transmitter facility located on its top, was erected in 1956. Paraglider flying eastwards from the top of the Gaisberg.

A sturdy charger, with distinctive ears, Gringolet was known far and wide for his ability in combat, and appears in very many romances in several different languages.

M.

The hemispherical indentation itself is an important element of paleoart, known as a \\"cupule\\". Cup and ring marks are also common in the Fertile Crescent, and India, then later in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and Alpine regions of Europe, sometimes associated with complex petroglyphs or megalithic monuments.Gansser A. Cupstones, Prehistoric Cult Objects Verlag Dr. C. M√ºller-Straten, M√ºnchen (1999). p. 18ff. . Etymology One encyclopedia of archaeology treats \\"pitted stone\\", \\"cupstones\\", and \\"nutting stones\\" as synonyms and says that they \\"may have been formed by cracking nutshells, though this activity lacks adequate confirmation through ethnographic examples or published experimentation.\\"George H. Odell, \\"Pitted Stones\\" in Archaeology of prehistoric native America: an encyclopedia, ed. Guy E. Gibbon and Kenneth M. Ames. (Privately printed in the United States, 1998), 652. Purpose These objects have received little study, perhaps because edged tools and weapons have more intrinsic interest to private collectors, but closer study of them might reveal something of domestic practices and toolmaking technology. There is no agreement upon their purpose or purposes, which may have included the processing of food, medicine or pigments, storage, arrow-production or fire- drilling. As such, they could represent a primitive form of mortar and pestle. The age of these man-made structures are difficult to ascertain, but generally they are believed to have been produced in the Bronze Age and Upper Paleolithic although some, for example in North America and Europe, were generated at a later date. Visually, they may resemble omarolluks, a naturally occurring feature of sedimentary rock occurring exclusively in the Belcher Islands, an archipelago accounting for 0.25% of Hudson Bay, whence they are thought to have been spread by glaciers.Dutch, S. (n.d.) Leaverites - Features in Sedimentary Rocks . Downloaded October 28, 2009 Distribution Similar objects can be found on all continents except Antarctica. They are associated with Celtic Europe, prehistoric Australia, Borneo and the Middle East. Some of the earliest cupules can be found at the Bhimbetka cave site in India, dating to 290,000-700,000 BCE, but in Europe they do not pre-date the most recent cold phase (the W√ºrm or Weichselian glaciation). Some scholars insist the items are \\"false\\" artifacts, that is, their form results from natural processes rather than human activity. However, no one has yet described processes that might both produce such effects and also explain the distribution of the effects and the objects. Certainly air-bubbles in stone, broken open and eroded, could produce some of these phenomena. The objects are familiar in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi, and occur elsewhere as well. The pattern, size and number of concavities is not predictable, nor is material‚Äîimpressions are found in soft sandstone and hard granite. Cupstones may exhibit a mixture of large and small indentations, perhaps indicating multiple uses over a considerable span of time. Indentations range from barely visible 1/16\\" to 6\\". Examination under magnification suggests the impressions were at least in some cases formed by rotary grinding, particularly in softer rocks. In most cases, archeological evidence of cupstones on hard rock surfaces and monoliths indicates that they were created by direct percussion with rock hammers. Typical impressions are of the simple pit type, though some cavities have been excavated to produce an opened-sphere type of pocket, by means and for reasons unknown. Very large specimens weighing several tons and with dozens of impressions several inches across are thought to be cult objects; they have been found throughout the Mississippi Valley.

Interpretation Early observers saw the processing of mast using stones, and one later recreation achieved similar results: nuts were placed, one at a time, on stone (an \\"anvil\\" stone\\") and then struck with a smaller \\"hammer\\" stone: \\"As nuts were cracked in this manner a pit developed in the lower stone; the pit deepened as additional nuts were cracked, and this facilitated the cracking process since nuts were held rather stationary in this 'seat.'\\"Talalay, Laurie Talalay, Donald R. Keller, and Patrick J. Munson, \\"Hickory Nuts, Walnuts, Butternuts, And Hazelnuts: Observation and Experiments Relevant to Their Aboriginal Exploitation in Eastern North America,\\" in Experiments and Observations on Aboriginal Wild Plant Food Utilization in Eastern North America, ed. Patrick J. Munson, (Indianapolis : Indiana Historical Society, 1984), 351. The most likely interpretation seems that these artifacts represent a single technique of shaping or adapting stone for multiple purposes, some unguessed (for instance, the function of the smallest pits) and that the objects could be used by single or multiple individuals over long periods of time, and for various purposes. Indeed, the apparent randomness of their distribution may indicate that they were left lying as modified natural resources, whether with benevolent intent or because they did not represent a sufficient investment of time and labor to justify transporting them (\\"opportunistic\\" tools). More simply, perhaps the users intended to return to the same area during the next year's mast-gathering period. The now traditional term \\"nutting stone\\" may be justified, as may \\"straightening stone\\" or \\"shaft-anchor\\" (for straightening arrow-shafts) within a larger class we might call \\"poculoliths\\" (<L. poculus, \\"small pocket\\", \\"cup\\"). While an equivalent to \\"pitted stone\\", the proposed term has the advantage of wider comprehensibility among international scholars as the worldwide distribution of the form becomes increasingly evident. Another interpretation of these structures is fossilization. Anatomical structures of the orbit, skull, joints, organs, antler and dental cavities are similar. Fragmentation may have occurred before or after fossilization, natural human smoothing and polishing. The structure becomes a ubiquitous, multipurpose tool for humans to exploit. Cupstone sites in Northern Italy, Switzerland and the Atlantic regions, also known as \\"druid altars\\" or \\"Opferkessel\\" (sacrificial bowl), are associated with places of worship due their locality close to glacial erratics, view points and treacherous alpine trails. Some of the prehistoric stonecup sites north of the Alps along the Jura mountains, for example near Grenchen, show a row of cups with possibly astronomical orientation. However, cupstones are usually not associated with calendar functions as this is sometimes the case with menhirs and megaliths. Omar with hemispherical bubble Omars Nutting stones can be very similar in appearance to omars. Omars are naturally formed stones that have hemispherical bubbles in them.

Forced saving can also happen when available goods are too expensive, therefore a person who has no access to credit has to accumulate the money for their purchase over an extended period of time. Definition of forced savings at the Financial times lexicon Forced saving holds a major role in describing how expansionary monetary policy in turn can cause artificial booms. Unlike saving money, forced saving is involuntarily decreasing present consumption, whilst saving money is voluntarily lowering present consumption for an increase of consumption in the future.  Examples  Example of the first mentioned situation could be forced savings of households caused by massive consumer goods shortages in Russia during 1991. Net forced saving ratio of households during year 1988 was estimated around more than 40%. The other situation could be rising costs of real estates and mortgages. Because of mortgage market regulations one does have to possess enough savings in order to apply for mortgage which leads to long term forced savings for many households amongst all Europe.  Forced saving ratio  We can define forced saving ratio which measures how much of household savings is composed by forced savings. \\"net\\" forced saving ratio = (shortage effect + demand spillover effect)/savings rate \\"gross\\" forced saving ratio = shortage effect/savings rate Net forced savings ratio considers that informal economy role under shortage conditions. Consequences Forced saving results in many faults and consequences. Two main problems can be distributional effects, and also recessions. ‚Ä¢ Distributional Effects Forced savings encounters problems with distribution effects as it can result in uncertainty in who receives the money that is entering the economy, and also unease about who will receive more purchasing power and who does not. ‚Ä¢Recessions The problem of having a recession can occur through forced savings through the use of investment. Some investments can result in being funded from the ‚Äòforced‚Äô savings which can cause problems. Over time, these investments will be seen to be errors and the liquidation process that occurs is what will in turn lead to a recession and a boom bust period cycle.

The existence of Sadler's Mill is first recorded in the 16th century, when it was owned by the manor of Great and Little Spursholt. Functioning as a corn and grist mill, it has passed through a succession of owners including Lord Palmerston who rebuilt it in 1747 and sold it in 1777 to one Benjamin Dawkins. Following another succession of owners it returned to the Broadlands estate in 1889. Milling ceased in 1932, when the mill building became redundant. The Broadlands estate sold the building in 2003, at which point it was close to collapse having been derelict for many years. Anthony and Sarah de Sigley, restored the building in 2005, rebuilding much of the original structure.

Its main office is located in Bologna, Italy. Background In 1988 Prof. Giovanni Romeo, President of the European Genetics Foundation (EGF) and professor of Medical Genetics at the University of Bologna and Prof. Victor A. McKusick founded together the European School of Genetic Medicine (ESGM). Since that time ESGM has taught genetics to postgraduate students (young M.D. and PhD) from some 70 different countries. Most of the courses are presented at ESGM's Main Training Center (MTC) in Bertinoro di Romagna (Italy), and are also available via webcast at authorized Remote Training Centers (RTC) in various countries in Europe and the Mediterranean area (Hybrid Courses). In the Netherlands and Switzerland, medical geneticists must attend at least one ESGM course before admission to their Board examinations. For these reasons, the School has been able to expand and to obtain funding from the European Commission and from other international organizations. Presentation of the Ronzano Project The European School of Genetic Medicine was founded in 1988 and saw rapid success, which necessitated that an administrative body be formed. To this end the European Genetics Foundation was born in Genoa on 20 November 1995, with the following aims: *to run the ESGM, promoting the advanced scientific and professional training of young European Geneticists, with particular attention to the applications in the field of preventive medicine; *to promote public education about genetics discoveries; *to organize conferences, courses, international prizes and initiatives aimed at bringing together the scientific and humanistic disciplines. The ESGM began receiving funding from the European Union and from other international organizations including the European Society of Human Genetics, the Federation of European Biochemical Societies, the March of Dimes and UNESCO. Since its founding, the ESGM has become a model for other European institutions responsible for advanced training in genetics. In order to fully realize all of the European Genetics Foundation's aims, the Foundation has identified a permanent site for the ESGM at the Hermitage of Ronzano, a monastery situated in the hills of Bologna, at 3.5 km from the city center and 7 km from the airport. The monastic order of the Servants of Maria, founded in Florence in 1233 and owner of the Hermitage, donated 16,000 m¬≤ for the purpose of constructing this center, which will be named the Giuseppe Levi and Victor A. Mckusick Euro-Mediterranean Center for Genetics and Medicine. Giuseppe Levi, a world-famous scientist, trained three Nobel Laureates (Salvador Luria, Renato Dulbecco and Rita Levi-Montalcini), and Victor A. McKusick is considered the father of medical genetics throughout the world. The European Genetics Foundation envisions the Ronzano Center as a venue for advanced training, and as a think tank where experts in genetics and related disciplines from all over the world can discuss issues of scientific, social, and political relevance, and to develop problem-solving strategies to address these issues. The new center will host: *the European School of Genetic Medicine (ESGM) *a European observatory for the legislation regarding genetic testing and policy regarding genetics research *advanced scientific courses outside of the area of Genetics, geared toward scientist from developing countries *a residential center in which Professors and students can live during residential courses *the Federation of the Association for Rare Diseases of Emilia-Romagna.

Titles, styles and honours =Titles and styles= Emanuele Filiberto is, by strict primogeniture in the male-line, the heir apparent of the House of Savoy, Italy's former ruling dynasty. In June 2006 his distant cousin Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, declared himself to be head of the house and rightful Duke of Savoy, maintaining that Vittorio Emanuele had forfeited his dynastic rights when he married Emanuele Filiberto's mother, Marina Ricolfi Doria, in 1971 without the legally required permission of his father and sovereign-in-exile, Umberto II.Enache, Nicolas.

There are prayer rooms, an outdoor garden, a small library, a gift shop, along with a cafe and restaurant. In all the mosque plays an important role in promoting the visibility of Islam and Muslims in France. It is the oldest mosque in Metropolitan France. History = Genesis of the project = The history of the Paris mosque is inextricably linked to France's colonization of large parts of the Muslim world over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. An early, if not the first, project for a mosque in Paris is recorded as desired to be ‚Äúin the Baujon district in 1842, followed by a revival of similar intentions at the Moroccan embassy in 1878 and 1885.‚ÄùMichel Renard, ¬´ Les pr√©misses d‚Äôune pr√©sence musulmane et sa perception en France ‚Äî S√©jours musulmans et rencontres avec l‚Äôislam ¬ª, dans Arkoun 2006, 2e partie, chap. II, p. 573‚Äì582. In 1846, the Soci√©t√© orientale (Eastern Society) proposed the construction ‚Äúin Paris, then at Marseilles, of a cemetery, mosque, and a Muslim school (coll√®ge).‚Äù According to the historian Michel Renard, it was put forward ‚Äúfor philanthropic reasons, augmented by political reasons (the recent conquest and pacification of Algeria), but also religious since Muslims were judged to be closer to Roman Catholicism than the Jews.‚Äù The negative reaction of the Ministry of Justice and Religions, which debated the matter with the National Assembly, shelved the project for ten years.Lettre du 28 janvier 1847 du minist√®re des Affaires √©trang√®res au minist√®re de l‚ÄôInt√©rieur et des Cultes. = The First ‚ÄúMosque‚Äù at P√®re-Lachaise = The minaret of the Great Mosque with its crenellated balustrade. A French Prefectorial decree of 29 November 1856 permitted the Ottoman Embassy in Paris to construct a special enclosure that was reserved for the burial of Muslims in the 85th division of the Parisian Cemetery of the East, called P√®re Lachaise. The enclosure measured about 800 square meters, and in it the Ottomans built a structure labeled as a 'Mosque,' in order to give shelter to funerary services and the prayers for the deceased. It was thus the first mosque constructed on Parisian territory. However, it was not the first in Western Europe since the disappearance of Muslims from the south of France in the ninth century, because there was an earlier mosque that had long been used in Marseille within the boundaries of the Cemetery of the Turks, but it had been destroyed during the French Revolution.‚Äù The cemetery covered the tombs of Ottomans who had died in France. Little used, in 1883 it was cut down in size, but soon the building fell into disrepair, so the Ottoman government decided to finance its reconstruction and extension. In 1914, an architectural design was put forward for a more prominent building with a dome and clear ‚ÄúIslamic‚Äù characteristics evident, but the First World War blocked the implementation of the project. In 1923, however, an inter-ministerial commission of Muslim affairs discussed the work for completing a Muslim cemetery in P√®re Lachaise. It concluded that it was not practical to build a mosque in the cemetery, as they were looking to build a mosque in the district of the Jardin des Plantes. = 1895 and 1915‚Äì16 projects = The first project for a true mosque in Paris was envisaged without success in 1895 by the Committee of French Africa set up by Th√©ophile Delcass√©, Jules Cambon, the Prince Bonaparte and the Prince d‚ÄôArenberg. An article in La Presse from 12 January 1896 was, however, optimistic about this project, specifically for a mosque to be constructed on the Quai d'Orsay, notably with the financial support of the Ottoman sultan, the Viceroy of Egypt, and the Sultan of Morocco.La Presse, no. 1324 (12 January 1896), p. 3 [archive] sur Gallica. The journalist Paul Bourdarie justified the construction of the Paris Mosque in the newspaper La Revue indig√®ne: > Such a proposal cannot be forgotten and lost [to history]. It reflects too > much the political outlook that France ought to follow towards her Muslim > sons, and which should translate above all into acts of political and > administrative equality and above all into gestures of sympathy and > goodwill. From its foundation in 1906, La Revue indig√®ne has put forward > plans to resume this project from which the reforms which she proposes will > be recommended and completed with success. The members of the Algerian > Muslim delegation in Paris who came to Paris in 1912, Dr. Benthami, Dr. > Moussa, the lawyer Mr. Mokhtar Hadj Sa√Ød, etc., recall that the question was > addressed at that moment in the course of the meetings which took place at > the headquarters of La Revue indig√®ne. In the meantime, Mr. Christian > Cherfils, the Islamophile and author of a work on Napol√©on and Islam, > recommended the erection of a mosque in Paris. Others, without a doubt, view > the same construction as both desirable and possible. Bourdarie evoked, in his article, the contradiction between the alliance with England which worked to dominate the majority of countries in the Muslim world while the French interest was to remain ‚Äúfriends of the Turk according to the wishes of Francis I and Suleiman the Magnificent‚Äù and to continue ‚Äúits role within Muslim Arab power.‚Äù La Revue indig√®ne believed that the project for the Parisian mosque was one that French citizens knew ‚Äúto be in accordance with their spirit and their heart‚Äôs love of their country and the respect of Islam.‚Äù It was why Bourdarie did not stop lobbying for his project and undertook serious work to get the French government to listen to him. As Bourdarie confided in his journal: > In May and June 1915, I began conferring with an architect, a student of > [Charles] Girault, Mr. E. Tronquois. Our discussions frequently turned > towards Islam and the role of French Muslims on the field of battle. Mr. > Tronquois expressed the opinion that a mosque would be a veritable > commemorative monument to their heroism and their sacrifices. I explained to > Mr. Tronquois the facts and points of view previously expressed and we > resolved also to get to work. And in the summer of 1916 a certain number of > Muslims living in Paris and their friends met several times at the > headquarters of La Revue indig√®ne in order to examine and, if need be, > critique the sketches of the architect. Among them I recall were the Emir > Khaled, having come from the Front and passing through Paris; Dr. Benthami; > the mufti Mokrani; Dr. Tamzali and his brother; Halil Bey; Ziane; the > painter Dinet; the Countess d‚ÄôAubigny; Lavenarde; Christian Cherfils; the > deputy A. Prat, etc. Following these meetings, a committee was formed, the > presidency of which was offered to Mr. √â[douard] Herriot, mayor of Lyon and > a senator; the vice-presidencies to Mr. Lucien Hubert, Senator; Marin and > Prat, members of the Chamber of Deputies; and A. Brisson, the director of > Annales politiques et litt√©raires. The Interministerial Commission of Muslim > Affairs, which knew of the project through Mr. Gout, had given its approval, > and Mr. Pichon, former Minister of Foreign Affairs, offered his patronage, > and so the project was brought directly to Mr. [Aristide] Briand, president > of the Council which approved it. Bourdarie was truly the father of the project for the Parisian mosque, and he worked tirelessly towards its completion. The first concept for the project was worked up by the architect Maurice Tranchant de Lunel, who was the Director of Fine Arts under Hubert Lyautey from 1912 onwards and a friend of Rudyard Kipling, C. Farr√®re, and Queen Elizabeth of Belgium. = Construction and financing = Entrance door of oak, with bronze hardware, surmounted by tracery in eucalyptus wood and a crescent with a star The decision to construct the mosque resurfaced more precisely in the aftermath of the Battle of Verdun when the Soci√©t√© des Habous was charged with constructing the mosque. This association, created in 1917, had the goal of organizing an annual pilgrimage to Mecca for residents of North Africa and insuring that the pilgrims followed regulations of security and hygiene during their travel to the Hejaz.Allocution du ministre de la D√©fense √† la grande mosqu√©e de Paris ‚Äì 11 novembre 2010. The Great Mosque of Paris was funded by the French state as per the law of 19 August 1920, which accorded a subvention of 500,000 francs for the construction of a Muslim Institute composed of a mosque, a library, and a meeting and study room. The law of 19 August 1920 did, however, infringe upon the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State promulgating the secular nature of the government, whose signatories had included Edouard Herriot and Aristide Briand themselves. The Great Mosque was built on the site of the former Charity Hospital (Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital) and adjacent to the Jardin des plantes. The first stone was laid in 1922. The work was completed by Robert Fournez, Maurice Montout and Charles Heub√®s based on plans by Maurice Tranchant de Lunel. The mosque was built following the Moorish style, and its minaret is 33 m high. = Inauguration = Yusef, Gaston Doumergue, Abdelqader Bin Ghabrit, Muhammad al-Muqri, and others in attendance at the mosque's inauguration in 1926. It was inaugurated on 16 July 1926, in the presence of French President Gaston Doumergue and Sultan Yusef of Morocco. Doumergue celebrated the Franco-Muslim friendship sealed by the bloodshed on the Western Front in World War I and affirmed that the Republic protected all beliefs. The Sufi Sheikh Ahmad al-Alawi led the first communal prayer to inaugurate the newly built mosque. On the eve of the inauguration, Messali Hadj held the first meeting of the Etoile nord-africaine (North African Star) and criticized the ‚Äúmosque publicity stunt.‚Äù In 1929, King Fuad I of Egypt donated the mosque's minbar, which is still used today. = Architecture = Inspired by the el-Qaraouyy√Æn Mosque in Fez, Morocco, one of the most important mosques in Morocco and one of the oldest in the world, all of the decorative program of the Paris Mosque, in particular the zelliges, was entrusted to specialized craftsmen from North Africa using traditional materials. The 33-meter-tall minaret was inspired by the Al-Zaytuna Mosque in Tunisia. The great entrance door to the Paris Mosque is ornamented with stylized floral motifs in the most pure Islamic style. The Great Mosque of Paris covers an area of 7,500 square meters, and comprises: * A prayer room whose decoration is inspired by many parts of the Muslim world * A Madrasa (school) * A library * A conference room * Arab gardens covering an area of 3,500 square meters * Annexes of a restaurant, tea room, hammam, and shops The Mosque, along with the Islamic Center, are listed in the supplementary inventory of Historic Monuments by the decree of 9 December 1983. The edifice is filed under the label of ‚ÄúTwentieth Century Patrimony‚Äù (Patrimoine du XXe si√®cle). The Great Mosque of Paris can accommodate up to 1,000 people, and authorizes access to women, and provides confessional rooms as well as access for handicapped persons. = Second World War = In a 1991 documentary, director Derri Berkani reported that during the Second World War and the occupation of France by the Nazis, the Great Mosque of Paris served as a site of resistance for Muslims living in France. The Algerians of the Francs- Tireurs et Partisans (FTP; Partisan Snipers) made it their mission to secure and protect British parachutists and find them shelter. Built on caves, the Mosque permitted them to secretly reach the Bi√®vre, a tributary of the Seine. The FTP also helped Jewish families or families whom they knew or at the request of friends, relocate to the Mosque while waiting for transit papers for passage to the Free Zone or to cross the Mediterranean Sea to the Maghreb. Jewish refugees were given papers declaring that they were Muslim and members of the mosque in order to protect them from persecution. Doctor Albert Assouline recorded some 1600 ration cards (one per person) that had been furnished by the Great Mosque of Paris for the Jews who had found refuge there. This little-known history was recounted in Karen Gray Ruelle and Deborah Durland DeSaix's, The Grand Mosque of Paris: A Story of How Muslims Rescued Jews During the Holocaust, a book for ages 8-12, published in the U.S. in 2009 (also in French and Japanese editions). The figures concerning the number of Jews housed and saved through the Paris Mosque during this period vary considerably according to various authors. , President of the Association des B√¢tisseuses de Paix (Association of the Female Builders of Peace), reports that, according to Albert Assouline, who appears in Birkani's film, 1600 people were saved. On the other hand, according to Alain Boyer, former official working with religions for the French Ministry of the Interior, the number was closer to 500 people. A call for witnesses to the circumstances of Jews saved by the Great Mosque of Paris between 1942 and 1944 was launched on 3 April 2005, at the same time as the Medal of Justice (m√©daille des Justes) was awarded by Yad Vashem to the descendants of the rector of the Mosque, Si Kaddour Benghabrit, who had saved the lives of a hundred Jews, including the singer Salim Halali, by giving them certificates of Muslim identity from the administrative personnel of the Mosque, thus allowing them to escape arrest and deportation. Serge Klarsfeld, the President of the Association des filles et des fils de d√©port√©s juifs de France (Association of the Sons and Daughters of Jewish Deportees from France), is, however, more skeptical about the figure of 1500 Jews saved and states that ‚Äúof the 2,500 members of our organization‚Äù there ‚Äúis nobody who has ever heard of it.‚Äù He considers, nonetheless, that the campaign to launch an appeal to witnesses undertaken by the Association des B√¢tisseuses de Paix to be ‚Äúpositive.‚ÄùAssma√¢ Rakho Mom, ¬´ Des juifs ont √©t√© sauv√©s par la mosqu√©e de Paris, l'association les B√¢tisseuses de paix veut rappeler les faits ¬ª, SaphirNews.com, 8 June 2008. The Franco-Moroccan director Isma√´l Ferroukhi made a 2011 film entitled Les hommes libres (The Free Men), about the forgotten history of the Muslim resistance fighters during World War II, with Tahar Rahim and Michael Lonsdale as the leading actors. The film was criticized by the historians Michel Renard and Daniel Lefeuvre, who consider it not particularly serious.  Today  The Grand Mosque plays an important role in French social society, promoting the visibility of Islam and Muslims. The mosque was assigned to Algeria in 1957 by the French Foreign Minister. The Paris Mosque serves as the head mosque for French mosques and is currently led by mufti Dalil Boubakeur, who has served as rector since 1992. In 1993 the Institut Al-Ghazali was founded, a religious seminary for the training of imams and Muslim chaplains. In 1994, Charles Pasqua, then the Minister of the Interior in charge of Religion, gave the Grand Mosque the authority of certifying meat as halal. On 12 December 2011, an official ceremony marked the start of the construction of a retractable roof covering the great patio facing the prayer hall of the Great Mosque. This important project, long-awaited for many years by its congregants in order to protect them during inclement weather, was an important feature of its original conception in 1922‚Äì26. In November 2012, a prayer room was set up in Paris by a member of the group 'Homosexual Muslims of France' Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed. The opening has been condemned by the Grand Mosque of Paris. In December 2013, the group Les Femmes dans la Mosqu√©e (Women in the Mosque) demanded from the administration the right to pray in the same room as men, having been excluded from it and relegated to the entrance foyer. For the spokesperson of the movement Hanane Karimi, ‚ÄúThe previous policy reflects the organization of the Muslim community along certain conventions today, that women have no place there; they have become invisible.‚Äù During the administration of Bertrand Delano√´, some controversies have arisen, such as those who want to give an emphyteutic lease to the Soci√©t√© des Habous and sacred places of Islam. In 2013, the office of the mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo refused permission of the construction of a second building for the Institut des Cultures d‚ÄôIslam (Institute of Muslim Cultures), citing the 1905 Law of the separation of Church and State. The Grand Mosque of Paris urged voters to \\"follow the path of hope\\" by voting for Emmanuel Macron, instead of Marine Le Pen. The Grand Mosque has endured multiple attacks against it by islamaphobic people. In 2015 a man attempted to drive a truck into the mosque, but was stopped by barriers put outside to prevent that incident. On another occasion in 2015 a man scrawled swastikas on the walls of the mosque. After the attacks the members of the mosque came together looking for hope and unity after the attempted vandalism. The Mosque maintains a positive public relations campaign in attempt to dispel common Islamic stereotypes that exist in France. Dr. Dalil Boubakeur is the official face of Islam in France and does everything in his power to provide access to his beliefs through books, interview, and is even a prominent social justice figure.  Legal status  Since 1921, the Great Mosque has been under the authority of the Soci√©t√© des Habous et lieux saints d l'Islam, an association regulated by the Law of 1901, owner of the building following its donation by the city of Paris. In the 1980s the Minister of the Interior Gaston Deferre withdrew the guardianship of the Mosque from the Ministry and the city of Paris, an act which has since permitted Algeria to finance a third of the budget of the mosque (in 2015, this budget totalled 1.8 million euros). Even if the mosque is legally independent, it remains religiously and culturally linked to Algeria, which exercises an unwritten right to the nomination of its rector; although, in 2015, Algeria announced officially the start of procedures for the acquisition of the property of the Great Mosque of Paris.  Halal control and traceability  The Institut musulman de la grande mosqu√©e de Paris is in a religious partnership with the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de contr√¥le de la viande halal (SFCVH; French Agency for Control of Halal Meat) agreed upon to regulate the priests authorized to perform ritual slaughter in conformation with the Decree of 15 December 1994 of the French Minister of Agriculture. The Institut musulman exercises the religious prerogatives in the matter of Islamic ritual sacrifice while the SFCVH is charged with overseeing the technical, administrative, and commercial aspects of control and certification of the processes of slaughter, such as electrocution and inert gas asphyxiation.  Tourism  Today the Grand Mosque is the largest mosque in France and the third largest in Europe. It is located in the 5th arrondissment in the Latin Quarter near the Jardin des Plantes and the Institut de Monde Arabe. The mosque is a tourist destination as well as a place of prayer, and it offers guided tours. There are also large Turkish marble baths for visitors. The mosque is open for tourists every day of the year (except for Fridays), outside of the rooms of imams and those for instruction, and the spaces reserved for reading of the Koran, prayers, and meditations by Muslims. The mosque also includes a traditional restaurant \\"Aux Portes de l'Orient\\" (At the Doors of the East) which serves the cuisine of the Magreb such as tagine and couscous, along with a tea room (serving mint tea, loukoum, pastries, hookah). There are also Turkish baths (exclusively for women), shops selling traditional Arab crafts, and all these establishments are open year-round to the public. The mosque is accessed from Paris M√©tro Line 7 from the stations Place Monge and Censier-Daubenton as well as by several bus lines of the RATP (47, 67, AND 89).

Tattrie started his career in the 1960s working for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling promotion out of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. During his career, Tattrie wrestled all over the globe, wrestling for promotions across the United States and Canada, Africa, Japan, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. He also competed in the World Wide Wrestling Federation. He teamed with Josip Peruzovic as The Mongols, and the pair held the WWWF International Tag Team Championship twice. Tattrie later held the title once more while teaming with Johnny DeFazio. Professional wrestling career =Early years= Born in Springhill, Nova Scotia in 1931, Tattrie ran away from home when he was only 12. He headed to Toronto and lived on the streets during World War II. He was very interested in boxing and once accidentally stumbled into a wrestling gym that he thought was a boxing dojo. It was there that he met wrestler Dave \\"The Wildman\\" McKigney who offered to cross train with him. Another wrestler that he met at the gym, Waldo Von Erich, got Tattrie in the door with the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), where he wrestled for a time as Tony Newbury. In 1963, he took his craft to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where he continued to train and work for Stu Hart's Stampede Wrestling. =The Mongols= While working in Stampede Wrestling, for Stu Hart Tattrie met Josip Peruzovic (better known in pro wrestling as Nikolai Volkoff). Tattrie took Peruzovic under his wing as a prot√©g√© and alongside Stu Hart trained the non- English speaking, 315 pound man to become a professional wrestler. Tattrie became known as Geto Mongol and Peruzovic as Bepo Mongol; together they were the Mongols. They had a very unorthodox appearance with bald heads and little \\"horns\\" of hair on the very top of their skulls. After meeting his would-be tag team partner, Bepo Mongol, Tattrie returned to the WWWF as Geto Mongol and The Mongols were brought to the United States in 1968. By 1970, Tattrie was a very busy man. From 1971 to 1972 he ran the Pittsburgh territory which worked closely with McMahon's WWWF. He built a home in Pittsburgh and continued to wrestle, using Ace Freeman as a figurehead promoter, so as not to confuse the fans.

The system possibly had the strongest winds ever measured in a tropical cyclone, tied with Hurricane Patricia of 2015. Nancy caused extensive damage, as well as at least 202 deaths and nearly five thousands of injuries in Japan and elsewhere, in September 1961. Meteorological history A tropical depression formed from a low-pressure area near Kwajalein Atoll on September 7. It strengthened rapidly; by the time position fixes could be taken, Nancy was nearly a super typhoon, on September 8. Moving gradually westward, Nancy explosively deepened and reached wind speeds equivalent to a Category 5 super typhoon (Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale) on September 9.Unisys Tracking Data accessed March 7, 2006 It would maintain that intensity for the next several days. Shortly after reaching peak intensity, Nancy approached the Ry≈´ky≈´ Islands and began turning. It passed near Okinawa and over Haze. The ridge steering Nancy broke down, and the typhoon turned sharply and headed towards Japan. Nancy made landfall as a strong typhoon on September 16 as it passed directly over Muroto Zaki. Nancy made a second landfall on Honsh≈´ near Osaka. The typhoon rapidly traveled up the length of the island as it continued accelerating, eventually reaching a forward speed of 65 mph (100 km/h, 55 knots).JTWC Nancy Report accessed March 7, 2006 The typhoon quickly crossed over Hokkaid≈ç before entering the Sea of Okhotsk as a tropical storm. Nancy went extratropical on September 17. The extratropical system eventually crossed over Kamchatka and entered the open ocean.Digital Typhoon: Typhoon list View accessed March 7, 2006 Impact Although no monetary value of all damage is known, damage was \\"phenomenal\\" in all areas where Nancy hit. There were at least 194 deaths and 8 people unaccounted for, according to Japanese government official confirmed. =Guam= On Guam, over half of all crops were destroyed by heavy winds and rain. A total of $40,000 (1961 USD) worth of damage was done to roads on the island. Most of the damage was on the southern end of the island. No deaths were reported on Guam. =Japan= In Japan, according to Japan Fire and Disaster Management Agency official confirmed report, 194 people were killed, 8 were missing, and 4,972 people were injured. These totals made Nancy the sixth-deadliest typhoon to hit Japan at the time. Timely warnings and adequate preparations were probably responsible for the relatively low death toll. The damage was \\"small\\" relative to other typhoons that impacted densely populated areas of Japan. Hundreds of thousands of people had their lives disrupted. Super Typhoon Nancy destroyed 11,539 houses, damaged 32,604 homes, and flooded 280,078 others. Although the exact number may never be known, the Stars and Stripes reported in late September 1961 that over 1,056 ships and fishing vessels were sunk or blown ashore, and that many more were damaged. Floodwaters washed away 566 bridges and caused 1146 landslides. Roads were destroyed at a total of 2,053 locations. Damages in Osaka amounted to $500 million (1961 USD).David Longshore Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones pg. 233 On Okinawa, low-lying areas experienced heavy flooding, which did significant damage to agriculture and structures. On Amami-o-Shima, one person was missing and another was badly injured. A ship was sunk. Extensive flooding of crops and houses left 152 people homeless. Due to Nancy's damage and death toll, the Japan Meteorological Agency named Nancy the \\"Second Muroto Typhoon\\". Nancy is one of only eight typhoons to receive special names in Japan. Records A reconnaissance aircraft flying into the typhoon near its peak intensity on September 12 determined Nancy's one-minute sustained winds to be 185 knots (215 mph; 345 km/h). If these values are reliable, they would be the highest wind speeds ever measured in a tropical cyclone.NOAA Tropical Cyclone FAQ Subject E1 accessed March 7, 2006 However, it was later determined that measurements and estimations of wind speeds from the 1940s to 1960s were excessive. Thus, Nancy's winds may actually be lower than its official best- track value. In 2016, reanalysis of Hurricane Patricia noted that the storm had the same sustained winds as Nancy, the highest on record in the Western Hemisphere. Although the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) did not exist at the time, Nancy would have been a Category 5 equivalent for a total of five and a half days (or 132 hours), assuming the wind speed data are reliable. If so, this is the record for the Northern Hemisphere and more than a day longer than the runner-up system, 1962's Typhoon Karen.NOAA Tropical Cyclone FAQ Subject E8 accessed March 7, 2006 See also * 1934 Muroto typhoon * Other storms of the same name * Typhoon Neoguri (2014) * Typhoon Jebi (2018) References External links * JMA General Information of Typhoon Nancy (6118) from Digital Typhoon * JTWC Report of Typhoon Nancy * Storm Path of Typhoon Nancy 1961 Pacific typhoon season Typhoons in Guam Typhoons in Japan Typhoon Nancy Typhoons ","title":"Typhoon Nancy (1961)"},{"id":"4310631","text":"Hammerhead Island is an 800-foot-long (243 m) island in the Aleutian Islands of the U.S. state of Alaska.

The building and its associated structures are privately owned, but the surrounding land is owned by the Test Valley Borough Council and managed as a local nature reserve. Although the present mill building dates from the late 16th or early 17th century, Rooksbury Mill may be one of the eleven mills that, according to the Domesday Book, existed in Andover in 1089.Quiddity Developments, p. 5. On the afternoon of Friday 29 May 1812, a barn at Rooksbury Mill was struck by lightning and set ablaze. The fire completely destroyed the barn and its contents, a nearby stable, and two carts. It was reported that the ‚Ä≥instantaneous and complete destruction‚Ä≥ of one of the carts excited particular astonishment. Two men sheltering next to the barn escaped permanent harm, though one of them was temporarily blinded. At that time the Mill was in the possession of the Holloway family. On the evening of Thursday 9 November 1843 another, though apparently accidental, fire destroyed a thatched barn that stood on exactly the same site as the 1812 barn fire. Although there were numerous people present, nothing could be done to extinguish the blaze, which also threatened the adjacent house and the Mill building, all being in the ownership of John Rawlinson, Esq. The barn eventually collapsed, destroying a large quantity of wheat and a threshing machine that had been in use at the time. The estimated cost of the damage was about ¬£1,000. One cause of concern was that the Andover fire engine did not arrive until nearly one hour after the fire had begun. Flour milling ceased at the site in the early 20th century, after which the mill building went through a series of uses, including being used as a small theatre. The Test Valley Borough Council sold the building in 2002, shortly after it had been devastated by fire following an arson attack. The new owners, Anthony and Sarah de Sigley, restored the building in 2003, rebuilding much of the original structure.

He was also linked in this regard to both Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield, through his connections with Bonds. Despite this information, the San Francisco Giants, allegedly in order to appease Bonds, did not bar Anderson from Giants' facilities. On July 15, 2005, Anderson, in a deal with federal prosecutors, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute steroids and to money-laundering. On October 18, 2005, he was sentenced by U.S. District Court Judge Susan Illston to three months in prison and three months' home confinement. Anderson and his steroid dealings are referred to in the book Game of Shadows, which documents the steroid use of many Major League Baseball players and other notable athletes. =Contempt of Court= On July 5, 2006, Anderson was found in contempt of court by U.S. District Judge William Alsup for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating perjury accusations against San Francisco Giants' player Barry Bonds. Bonds appeared before a grand jury investigating the BALCO steroids case in December 2003 and is reported to have denied knowingly using performance-enhancing drugs. Anderson, denied bail, was immediately sent to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California. Anderson's attorney, Mark Geragos, said he would file an appeal based on his assertion that the subpoena to testify violated Anderson's plea bargain agreement in the BALCO case. On July 20, 2006, Anderson was released when the grand jury's term expired without indicting Bonds. However, Anderson was immediately subpoenaed to testify before a new grand jury that took up the case. Anderson's attorney, Mark Geragos, stated that Anderson would still refuse to testify, and on August 28, Anderson was again found in contempt of court and sentenced to prison. On November 15, 2007, a federal judge ordered Anderson released from prison. This order came just hours after Bonds was indicted by a federal grand jury on 4 counts of perjury and 1 count of obstruction of justice.Judge orders Anderson released from prison - Baseball - MSNBC.com =Further legal troubles= On January 28, 2009 twenty federal agents raided the home of Anderson's mother- in-law; both she and Anderson's wife are the targets of a tax probe. Anderson's attorney Mark Geragos says that he believes the probe is in retaliation for Anderson's continued refusal to say if he will testify in the upcoming 2009 Bonds perjury trial. Federal prosecutors have asked the presiding judge, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, to find Anderson in contempt of court and have him detained in federal prison for the length of the upcoming trial.Feds Raid Home of Bonds Trainer's Mother-in-Law SI.com, January 28, 2009 On March 22, 2011 Anderson was reincarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin on fresh contempt charges for refusing to testify at Bond's perjury trial.Bonds' former trainer jailed for refusal to testify csnbayarea.com, March 22, 2011 He was released as of April 8, 2011.

In this year, Dynalift was the best-selling forklift truck in Greece. Petropoulos (the full name of the company is Petros Petropoulos A.E.B.E.) is today a major importer and distributor of vehicles and heavy machinery, having been, at the same time, one of the \\"historic\\" Greek engine and vehicle manufacturers.  History  = Early steps = The Petropoulos family has been involved in metal constructions for generations. Konstantinos Petropoulos was a well known manufacturer of church bells and metal products in the late 19th century, based in Amfissa and, later, in Lamia. According to tradition, there was a supposed well-kept \\"secret\\" behind the sound quality of the Petropoulos bells ‚Äì the bell being today the recognizable company logo. The company in its present form was founded by Petros Petropoulos in Thessaloniki in 1922. Early activities included sales of commercial vehicles as well as rebuilding of engines and vehicle assembly. This early construction activity involved assembly of Ford (1920s) and Willys-Overland (1930s) passenger cars, and Diamond T and International trucks (1930s). The Petropoulos factory was put under German control during the Axis occupation of Greece in World War II. The company resumed business after the war, and in 1948 it moved its headquarters to Athens, where it already had created a subsidiary. = Post-WWII Development = Rebuilding of engines remained a major activity until 1953, when Petropoulos greatly expanded the popularity of the diesel engine in Greece, thanks to its cooperation with British F. Perkins Limited. In 1956 Petropoulos made a bold move, investing in farm tractor production. Model Œ†-35 introduced in 1956, as well as the more powerful Œ†-55 that followed shortly, were based on International Harvester designs (powered, though, by Perkins engines). Competitively priced and robust, these tractors became immediate success stories; however, in the early 1960s the company was engaged in a legal dispute over market (competition) rules with Malkotsis, another Greek tractor manufacturer claiming a share in the fast developing tractor market, resulting in production delays that almost bankrupted the company. The company eventually abandoned production of its own tractor series and focused on engine production and truck and tractor assembly (Petropoulos-assembled trucks and tractors were exported to Europe and the Middle East). In 1974 it engaged into its boldest project, development and production of a new \\"smart\\" 4X4 truck family (Unitrak/Polytrak/Militrak models). The trucks sold fairly well to farmers, but the Greek Army ordered only small numbers of the Militrak version. This, and a 1984 change of a law that had made \\"farm vehicles\\" economically attractive, lead to termination of production. Once more the company, after heavily investing in an industrial project, was found in a dire financial state. = Decline of the Industrial Division and New Ventures = Petropoulos has developed a variety of other industrial products, including power generators and forklift trucks (most notably the successful Dynalift family of Diesel- and Electric-powered forklifts). It even made an effort in 1994 to resume truck production, introducing a Swiss (Bucher) ‚Äì designed vehicle as the Militrak II Duro; however, the vehicle was not adopted by the Greek Army. Since the late 1990s Petropoulos has decisively shifted to imports, trading and services retaining only a limited industrial activity. The company maintains a small museum within its facilities, with exhibits including a restored Œ†-35 tractor and a fully restored polytrak.  References  * L.S.

Amiga Corporation  The Amiga's Original Chip Set, code-named Lorraine, was designed by the Amiga Corporation during the end of the first home video game boom. Development of the Lorraine project was done using a Sage IV machine nicknamed \\"Agony\\" which had 64-kbit memory modules with a capacity of 1 mbit and a 8 MHz . 090427 floodgap.com Amiga Corp. funded the development of the Lorraine by manufacturing game controllers, and later with an initial bridge loan from Atari Inc. while seeking further investors. The chipset was to be used in a video game machine, but following the video game crash of 1983, the Lorraine was reconceived as a multi-tasking multi-media personal computer. The company demonstrated a prototype at the January 1984 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Chicago, attempting to attract investors. The Sage acted as the CPU, and BYTE described \\"big steel boxes\\" substituting for the chipset that did not yet exist. The magazine reported in April 1984 that Amiga Corporation \\"is developing a 68000-based home computer with a custom graphics processor. With 128K bytes of RAM and a floppy-disk drive, the computer will reportedly sell for less than $1000 late this year.\\" Further presentations were made at the following CES in June 1984, to Sony, HP, Philips, Apple, Silicon Graphics, and others. Steve Jobs of Apple, who had just introduced the Macintosh in January, was shown the original prototype for the first Amiga and stated that there was too much hardware ‚Äì even though the newly redesigned board consisted of just three silicon chips which had yet to be shrunk down. Investors became increasingly wary of new computer companies in an industry dominated by the IBM PC. Jay Miner, co-founder, lead engineer and architect, took out a second mortgage on his home to keep the company from going bankrupt. In July 1984, Atari Inc. was bought by the recently resigned CEO and founder of Commodore, Jack Tramiel. A substantial number of Commodore's employees followed him, prompting a lawsuit from Commodore for theft of trade secrets. Tramiel's son Leonard later discovered that Atari Inc. had lent $500,000 to the Amiga Corporation, with repayment due at the end of June, prompting Atari Corp. to counter Commodore. In a subsequent development, the Amiga group received interested from Commodore, and began discussions of selling the company. In August 1984, Amiga was purchased by Commodore for $27 million, including paying off the loan from Atari. Commodore = 1985‚Äì87: the early years= When the first Amiga computer was released in July 1985 by Commodore, it was called the Amiga 1000, devoid of references to Commodore. Commodore marketed it both as their successor to the Commodore 64, and as their competitor against the Apple Macintosh. It was later renamed the Commodore Amiga 1000. The Amiga 1000's graphics abilities were significantly ahead of its rivals. At a relatively affordable base price of , the Amiga could display up to , produce 8-bit stereo audio, and run several applications concurrently. These qualities were unprecedented in a consumer-oriented computer and gave the Amiga 1000 a significant technical lead on its three main competitors (the Atari ST, the Macintosh, and the IBM PC). The public saw both Commodore and Atari selling, as John C. Dvorak wrote, \\"cheap disposable\\" game machines, and observers believed that either the ST or Amiga would survive, but not both. The ST had more software in the beginning, but larger companies like Electronic Arts and Activision promised to make software for the Amiga. Neither had distribution from major chains like ComputerLand or BusinessLand, or support from large business-software companies like Microsoft, Ashton-Tate, or Lotus. The New York Times stated that \\"it is not clear that the business computer user really cares about colorful graphics\\". The computers' sophisticated graphics strengthened their perception as \\"game machines\\". Poorly marketed, the Amiga 1000 was not a success. An August 1986 Compute! editorial expressed amazement that Commodore, insisting that the Amiga was a business computer, did not show it at the summer CES. The magazine estimated that in their first year of availability, the Atari ST had outsold the Amiga. Stating that the \\"industry needs the vision and direction that a Commodore can help provide\\", it urged the company to pursue the consumer market that had been very successful for the Commodore 64. Jerry Pournelle from BYTE praised the Amiga Sidecar as \\"really impressive\\", and approved of the \\"great deal of Amiga software\\" at Spring COMDEX, but wondered \\"whether Commdore has enough high-tech people to support the Amiga properly\\" after large layoffs, while \\"Atari ST software pours forth like a flood\\". Bruce Webster reported in January 1987 that Commodore had sold about 150,000 Amigas as of October 1986, but \\"imagine how many [the company] might have sold if they had done things right\\". He criticized many aspects of Commodore's handling of the computer, including selling \\"not-quite-finished\\" hardware and software, not supporting third-party developers, poor advertising, and internal uncertainty of the Amiga's target market. Aware of its reputation, Commodore asked the press to call the computer \\"The Amiga, from Commodore\\" and designed new logos to replace its own iconic \\"C=\\" design. Commodore compounded the problem by marketing the new 8-bit Commodore 128 alongside the Amiga, confusing the general public about Commodore's direction and the Amiga's advantages. By 1987, rumors spread that the size of the Amiga market disappointed software vendors, which were uncertain of Commodore's intention for the computer. Bing Gordon of Electronic Arts, which had prominently supported the Amiga, stated that year that \\"the Amiga has never done as well as we had hoped when we started out\\", and that Electronic Arts had expected Commodore to sell it as a $600 high-end home computer instead of an $1800 business computer. The best-selling Amiga games sold about 25,000 copies in 1986, said Gordon, compared to 125,000 to 150,000 copies on the Commodore 64. In 1994 BYTE wrote \\"The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody ‚Äì including Commodore's marketing department ‚Äì could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video.\\" This marketing confusion would plague the Amiga throughout its lifetime, even as it changed hands between Escom, Gateway, and other owners. =1987‚Äì90: Cost- reduced and high-end models= In 1987, faced with strong competition from Atari ST in the lower end of the segment, Commodore released the cost-reduced Amiga 500 and the high-end Amiga 2000, for the respective prices of US$699 and $2395 (this price included 1 MB RAM and a monitor). By 1988, software sales for the Amiga remained disappointing, compared to those for the IBM PC, Commodore 64, and Apple II. With its lowered price, the Amiga 500 became a successful home computer and eventually outsold its main rival, the Atari ST. The Amiga 2000, thanks to its Genlock and internal expansion slots, also managed to carve out a market niche within desktop video. This market was not as large as the office and publishing markets dominated by the IBM PC and Apple Macintosh, and the Amiga 2000 lagged behind these systems in sales. Additionally, Commodore had initially announced a price of $1495 for 2000, resulting in widespread disappointment among their customer base when the higher price was made public. This was also the case for the A500, which Commodore announced its price as $595.95, but later released it at $699. The Amiga did see widespread use in the television and video production industry during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including on popular shows like Clarissa Explains It All and Unsolved Mysteries. =1990‚Äì93: Height of popularity= An Amiga 500, with 1084S RGB monitor and A1010 floppy disk drive. (1987) In 1990, Commodore released a significant update of the Amiga platform, in the shape of the Amiga 3000 featuring an enhanced chipset (ECS) and the second release of its operating system, commonly referred to as Workbench 2.0. Commodore had a poor reputation among consumers and developers. Computer Gaming World wrote in 1990 of its \\"abysmal record of customer and technical support in the past\\". Commodore was unable to match the pace of PC advancement with their lower resources and economy of scale, and users complained that the custom ECS chipset failed to match the features of the PC and Mac display hardware at the time. Users also felt that the operating system (Workbench 2.0) only featured improvements taken from the user community. As Apple was the only other major user of Motorola chips at the time, Commodore often had to wait for a new CPU technology until increased supplies allowed Motorola to sell chips to anyone but Apple. On the plus side, many users considered the Amiga 3000 the most well-engineered Amiga model, and the Amiga 3000's integrated flicker filter made it painless to use inexpensive PC-style VGA monitors. This may in part be the reason Commodore went on to sell one million Amigas in just one year, which is equal to a third of all Amigas sold up to that time. In the same year as the Amiga 3000, Commodore released the US$895 CDTV, aimed to move the Amiga platform to the living room and a competitor to devices such as Philips CD Interactive (CD-I). Commodore believed that there was a market for a system that could display animations, pictures and offer educational software and games on television, and many game developers thought that interactive CD-based video games would become a popular market. The end result was a system that could be described as an Amiga 500 with a remote control replacing the keyboard and a CD-ROM replacing the floppy drive. Considering that the Amiga 500 was cheaper, more versatile, and had the promise of a future CDTV expansion, few Amiga users had any interest in the Amiga CDTV. At the same time, the general public preferred cheaper game consoles over both the CDTV and CD-I and was not aware of or interested in the multimedia potential of these CD-ROM based systems. Both Commodore and Philips tried to tempt users with the promise of an MPEG-1 module capable of playing video from a CD-ROM. These Video CDs can be considered lower-resolution versions of today's Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs), but without some additional features and the inconvenience of having to change the disks during a full-length movie. The CDTV became Commodore's first Amiga-based failure, one that allegedly cost them a significant amount of resources. Commodore made a last-ditch effort in saving the system with the CDTV 2 but dropped that design in favor of the much more capable Amiga CD32. =1992‚Äì94: Trouble ahead= An Amiga 4000 (1992) Commodore began 1992 early by introducing the Amiga 500+, a slightly updated and cost-reduced Amiga 500. Viewed primarily as a game machine, especially in Europe, this model was criticized for not being able to run popular games such as SWIV, Treasure Island Dizzy, and Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge, and some people returned them to dealers, demanding an original Amiga 500. By the early 1990s, the IBM PC platform dominated the market for computer games. In December 1992, Computer Gaming World (CGW) reported that MS-DOS accounted for 82% of game sales in 1991, compared to Macintosh's 8% and Amiga's 5%. In response to a reader's challenge to find a DOS game that played better than the Amiga version the magazine cited Wing Commander and Civilization, and added that \\"The heavy MS- DOS emphasis in CGW merely reflects the realities of the market\\". Instead of discontinuing the Amiga 500 and 500+, Commodore envisioned it taking the place of the Commodore 64 in the low-cost segment. To make that possible Commodore set out to design the Amiga 600, a system intended to be much cheaper than the Amiga 500. The Amiga 500 itself would be replaced by Amiga 1200, also under development. Shortly after releasing the Amiga 600, Commodore announced that two new super Amigas would be released at the end of the year. In classic Osborne style, consumers decided to wait for the new Amigas and Commodore had to close their Australian office in face of plummeting sales. At the same time, Commodore's foray into the highly competitive PC market was unsuccessful. This contributed to Commodore's 1992 profits falling to an unimpressive $28 million,Edge, August 1995 and made the need for a successful new Amiga launch all that more critical. In October 1992, Commodore released the Amiga 1200 and the Amiga 4000. Each featured the new AGA chipset and the third release of AmigaOS. Computer Gaming World reported in March 1993 that declining Amiga sales were \\"causing many U.S. publishers to quit publishing Amiga titles\\", and in July that at the Spring European Computer Trade Show the computer was, unlike 1992, \\"hardly mentioned, let alone seen\\". That year Commodore marketed the CD32, which was one of the earliest CD-based consoles and was also the world's first 32-bit game machine, with specifications similar to the A1200. The last Amiga (and the last computer) released by Commodore was the A4000T, in 1994. =Amiga in the United States= Mass- market Amigas were considerably cheaper than PCs and Macintoshes at the time. This factor helped to boost sales in European markets, but it also continued Commodore's misfortune of being viewed in the more price-conscious US markets as a producer of cheap \\"toy computers\\" and \\"game machines\\". This perception was furthered by the fact that most Commodore retail outlets were toy stores, and marketing campaigns were mismatched with the public's needs and wants. Overall, the Amiga was very successful in Europe, but it sold less than a million units in the US. Additionally, in the US market, the IBM PC was already a dominant market force, especially in the workplace. Potential buyers' first question was often, \\"Is it IBM compatible?\\", allowing the user to \\"take work home\\" or more often, take software home to install on their own machines. To satisfy these users, Commodore introduced a variety of PC- compatibility add-ons, such as the Amiga Sidecar for the Amiga 1000, the Bridge Board for the A2000, and a 5.25\\" floppy disk drive to facilitate data exchange with PC disks. Even as Commodore was improving the Amiga's interoperability, the PC's graphics drastically improved from the early mediocre CGA and EGA modes prevalent at the Amiga's introduction to VGA and SVGA, which appeared to match or exceed the Amiga's abilities. This caused a raft of PC gaming titles to be introduced during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including many, ported from Amiga versions. Consumers began to see no advantage in the Amiga's \\"incompatible\\" technology. Commodore's attempts at interoperability did not persuade users concerned about IBM compatibility to buy an Amiga. Instead, inexpensive PC clones were beginning to flood the US market. As a result, US Amiga users tended to be technophiles, enamored of the Amiga's software or hardware capabilities, Commodore loyalists upgrading from the C-64 or 128, iconoclasts who disliked IBM, video and graphic arts enthusiasts, or professionals ‚Äì the desktop video market was one of the few areas where the Amiga would gain widespread adoption in the US outside of the home. =Bankruptcy= Commodore management voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 under US bankruptcy laws in late April 1994. Chapter 11 US rules allow a firm to recover its debts and reorganize it. Commodore was reorganized in various occasions twice before and repaid by Irving Gould without requesting filing for Chapter 11, but this time, as being controlled by US bankruptcy laws, the court-appointed board of trustees decided to liquidate the company without proceeding to reorganization. The majority of Commodore's assets and name were sold to Escom. Production was halted briefly until it was restarted for a short time under Escom's Amiga Technologies. Though the machines had been upgraded and had plentiful hardware and software support, the lack of new Amigas meant that vendors sooner or later moved on. Most of the technology hobbyists and productivity market moved to PC architecture, sometimes running Linux or BeOS in preference to Microsoft Windows. Due to the fierce loyalty of some Amiga fans, the 'scene' continued for many year after the last original Amiga was sold. Inevitably, the PC eventually became the undisputed leading home computing technology, and the console wars also left the CD32. The rights to the Amiga platform were successively sold to Escom, and later, Gateway 2000. Escom had almost immediately gone bankrupt itself (due to non-Amiga related problems), while Gateway decided to keep the patents and sell the remaining assets to a new company later renamed to Amiga, Inc. (no relation to the original Amiga Corporation) in 1999. Amiga also received a license to use Amiga-related patents, which were retained by Gateway until they expired. Amiga Inc. sold the copyrights for works created up to 1993 to Cloanto, and commissioned development of AmigaOS 4 to Hyperion Entertainment.  New Amigas  Since the end of the Commodore-Amiga, there have been many attempts to create new Amiga hardware and solutions. All new Amigas are built from standard components without using the original Commodore custom chips. =Amiga compatibles= Only Amiga compatible machines share the original Amiga heritage with the custom chip compatibility. While they are not using the original chips (as in original Amiga computers), they implement compatible functionality using their field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) or custom bootloaders. DraCo The DraCo was the first Amiga clone. It was released during the bankruptcy of Commodore International in 1994 and was sold until 2000. Unlike later systems employing FPGA for the custom chipset, the Draco only provided compatibility at the operating system level and used a bootloader to patch various system devices and libraries that attempted to directly access any real Amiga chips. It was never intended to be a 'general purpose' desktop computer, however, users have been able to get some models to boot to Workbench. Minimig Minimig 120√ó120 mm PCB board (Nano-ITX size) June 11, 2006 amiga.org Minimig is an open source hardware implementation of the Amiga 500 with the custom chipset implemented using a FPGA, released under the GNU General Public Licence. It uses the MC68000 CPU chip from Freescale and supports overclocking up to 50 MHz. The size of the FPGA limited the MiniMig to a subset of the ECS graphics, lacking support for productivity modes on the real chipset. It was also limited to only 2 MB of memory that was artificially split into ROM, \\"chip\\", and \\"fast\\" segments with an aftermarket 'hack' that could increase it to 4 MB total. Natami Natami was a hardware project to build 68k-based computers to run AmigaOS. While the original project is defunct, many of the core members of Natami have moved onto the Vampire project. Vampire V4 Standalone Vampire V4 Standalone is an FPGA Amiga-compatible currently in development by Apollo Accelerators. It is built around the Apollo Core 68080 (AC68080) first launched in the V2 line of accelerators, the V500 and V600, which are compatible with the Amiga 500 and Amiga 600, respectively. Although not originally designed as such, the V500 has also been installed in the original Amiga 1000 and Amiga 2000 desktop systems, as these all used the same, socketed version of the original Motorola 68000 processor. While the V2 was only designed as an accelerator, it was equipped with local memory, ethernet, microSD and retargetable graphics (RTG), named \\"SAGA\\" or Super-AGA. The V4 is designed to replace the V2 V500 model as an accelerator, as well as operate entirely independently of any computer in a so-called \\"standalone mode\\". To accomplish this, Apollo Accelerators has built a cleanroom version of the AGA chipset and added direct support classic DB9-based joysticks and various low or full-speed USB 2.0 peripherals such as mice, keyboard and gamepads. Amiga AGA graphics are automatically upscaled to HDMI (576p) resolution and can switch automatically between classic and SAGA display modes for use with modern LCD monitors and televisions. As of August 2019, the AC68080 is the fastest 680x0-compatible Amiga processor with more than four times the performance of the previously fastest, the Motorola 68060. It is capable of 192.12 MIPS and 102.06 MFLOPS, while the Cyberstorm 68060 at 50 MHz was capable of only 39.29 MIPS and 28.02 MFLOPS. Performance gains are aided by using modern DDR3 memory which is capable of over 500 MiB/s in all memory regions. In contrast, the original Amiga processors were significantly bottlenecked accessing shared \\"chip\\" memory, achieving less than 3 MiB/s on OCS and ECS machines, and no more than 6.5 MiB/s on AGA machines with all chipsets having DMA disabled. The AC68080 is closed source, although it may be available for licensing. It is designed to use the original, closed-source Commodore AmigaOS (up to and including the most recent AmigaOS 3.1.4 release from Hyperion), but can also run AROS, EmuTOS, and FreeMiNT, as well as the Classic Macintosh OS. =AmigaOS 4 systems= The AmigaOS is known for combining the functionality of OS and window manager. It was primarily designed to run on PowerPC Amiga systems or hardware equipped with Cyberstorm PPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards as well as AmigaOne computers with PPC Teron installed. This system was only available in developer pre-releases for several years until the final release in December 2006. Since 2001, Hyperion Entertainment has been developing new AmigaOS 4 running on PowerPC-based systems. The contract between Amiga Inc. and this Belgian-German company only allowed for the availability of the commercial AmigaOS 4 license to computers with AmigaOne motherboards. AmigaOS 4 also runs on the Sam440 line developed by ACube Systems, following an agreement Hyperion. It also runs on Pegasos II systems developed by Genesi/bPlan and AmigaOne systems developed by British Eyetech and A-eon Technologies. AmigaOS 4 can run system-friendly AmigaOS software written for original Commodore Amigas. AmigaOS 4 provides backward- compatibility to 68K software through tiered emulation. If the program is known to be OS-friendly (it does not attempt to access hardware directly), then a lightweight JIT emulator is used and calls are allowed directly to AmigaOS 4's API which remains largely compatible to AmigaOS 3.x. However, if the program is not known, or is known to access hardware directly, then it will be executed using E-UAE. =AROS systems= AROS is an open-source re- implementation of AmigaOS and is designed more for portability. The features of the first attempts replicated those found in the AmigaOS 3.1. It runs on many x86-based systems as native or hosted flavors. AROS also runs on some 68k-based Amigas and PowerPC systems. There are also sellers of 'AresOne' systems dedicated to run AROS only. Unlike many other Amiga-based solutions, AROS is Amiga binary compatible only on 68k-based systems. This version is recognized for its high degree of compatibility at the source-code level, allowing it to make concessions towards the legacy deficiencies of the OS it was based from. =MorphOS systems= MorphOS is a closed-source re- implementation of AmigaOS. It runs on PowerPC-based systems but can run system-friendly AmigaOS software written for the original Commodore Amigas. MorphOS runs on Efika, Pegasos I/II and PowerPC based Apple Mac G4 models, such as the Mac Mini, eMac, PowerMac, PowerBook, and iBook.

It was first published in the zombie anthology Book of the Dead (1989) and later included in King's short story collection Nightmares & Dreamscapes (1993). Plot  The protagonist of the story is Maddie Pace, a timid and indecisive young woman who lives on a small island named Gennesault (or \\"Jenny\\"), off the coast of Maine. Maddie is both pregnant and a widow, having recently lost her husband in a fishing boat accident. After a scattering of initial outbreaks, dead bodies all over the world begin to reanimate en masse and attack the living. The source of the phenomenon is eventually traced to \\"Star Wormwood\\", a bizarre alien construct orbiting above the ozone layer at the Earth's south pole. A space shuttle under joint American-Chinese authority visits the site and promptly meets with disaster.This scenario is impossible outside of fiction; an object could not physically sit stationary above the Pole while in the type of low Earth orbit that the Space Shuttle could access. After further attempts to destroy the object fail, the zombie plague spreads and civilization collapses. Jenny's inhabitants gather up all the available firearms to prepare for their own attack, which all too soon erupts from the island's small cemetery. The island's men are forced to destroy their undead loved ones as they crawl out of their graves. The still-moving pieces of the reanimated corpses are then burned with kerosene and the remains plowed underground by a bulldozer. Frank Daggett, the elderly man who did most of the organizing of the successful defense, suffers a fatal heart attack and has himself blasted to pieces so he won't reanimate. While she is hearing about the battle at the cemetery from her neighbor, Maddie recalls her own confrontation with the animated corpse of her husband, come back to get her from the bottom of the sea. She succeeds in destroying him/it and faces the future, however grim, with renewed confidence and hope. Version changes There are some differences between the versions published in The Book of the Dead and Nightmares and Dreamscapes, none of which are significant to the plot. For example, the space expedition in the original publication was U.S.-Soviet; the change in the later publication reflects the end of the Cold War. Adaptations A 2005 animated short of the story was produced and was screened at RiverRun International Film Festival, produced by Guillermo del Toro. \\"Home Delivery\\" has been adapted by artist Glenn Chadbourne for the book The Secretary of Dreams, a collection of comics based on King's short fiction released by Cemetery Dance in December 2006. In September 2009, the story was optioned as a theatrical release and was in pre-production. No release date has been set at this time. John and Paul Buckholts, of Our Thing Productions, have written the screenplay and Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura was scheduled to direct.

The Council conducts research in biomedicine, social science, and public health and helps build research capacities in developing countries. One-third of its research relates to HIV and AIDS; while its other major program areas are in reproductive health and its relation to poverty, youth, and gender. For example, the Population Council strives to teach boys that they can be involved in contraceptive methods regardless of stereotypes that limit male responsibility in child bearing. The organization held the license for Norplant contraceptive implant, and now holds the license for Mirena intrauterine system. The Population Council also publishes the journal Population and Development Review, which reports scientific research on the interrelationships between population and socioeconomic development. It also provides a forum for discussion on related issues of public policy and Studies in Family Planning, which focuses on public health, social science, and biomedical research involving sexual and reproductive health, fertility, and family planning. Organization Established in 1952 by John D. Rockefeller III, with important funding from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Council is governed by an international board of trustees. After many years of evolving, the 2006 council board includes leaders in many different fields. These include: biomedicine, business, economic development, government, health, international finance, media studies, philanthropy, and social science. Headquartered in New York City, the Population Council has 18 offices in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and does work in more than 60 countries. With an annual budget of around $74 million, it employs more than 500 people from 33 countries with expertise in a wide array of scientific disciplines. Roughly 55 percent are based outside the United States. John D. Rockefeller III convened distinguished scientists in Williamsburg, Virginia, under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences, to begin the search for a better understanding of demographic trends. Shortly thereafter, in 1952, he established the Population Council as an independent, nonprofit organization. He served as the Council's first president. Rockefeller eventually became non- executive chairman of the board, serving until his death in an auto accident in 1978. Population Council presidents following Rockefeller are: Frederick Osborn (1957-1959), Frank Notestein (1959-1968), Bernard Berelson (1968-1974), George Zeidenstein (1977-1992), Margaret Catley-Carlson (1993-1999), Linda Martin (2000-2004), Peter J. Donaldson (2005-2015), and Julia Bunting (2015‚Äìpresent).  Contraception  The Population Council conducts biomedical research to develop contraceptives and social science research to better understand the factors influencing access to and decision-making around contraceptives. Its research on reproductive and immunological processes serves, not only as the basis for the development of new contraceptive methods that reach out to both men and women, but also for new hormone therapies and AIDS-prevention products. The council is involved in a \\"collaboration with industry partner ProMed Pharma to develop innovative new vaginal rings that may make STI prevention more acceptable and effective for women.\\" In the 1960s, the Council played a key role in documenting the large numbers of people in poor countries who lacked access to contraceptives and in conducting research to design and evaluate public family planning programs. This included bringing IUDs to India. At this time, the Council's biomedical researchers worked to develop contraceptive methods, such as the intrauterine device. The council has found that fertility is \\"most sensitive to changes in the proportions married and prevalence of contraception.\\" A country's ideas around reproduction out of wedlock, its accessibility, and the public's opinion of birth control are instrumental in the region's fertility. An array of contraceptives available around the world today were developed by the Population Council, including: the Copper T Intrauterine device, Norplant, Jadelle (Norplant II), Mirena, and, in 2018, a one year contraceptive vaginal system called Annovera was approved by the US FDA. More than 50 million Copper T IUDs have been distributed in over 70 countries. Norplant was replaced by Jadelle, a two rod implant that provides contraception for five years. The British medical journal Lancet said of the Population Council, \\"Most non- governmental organizations claim to promote change; the Population Council actually has hard evidence of having changed the lives and expectations of hundreds of millions of people.\\"The Lancet. (Vol. 361, June 7, 2003, review)  HIV prevention  The Population Council provides programs all over the world that aim to address the prevention and treatment of the HI virus. These programs help to develop new technologies and distribute them to marginalized populations, and also educate people about HIV through workshops and mentorship services. For example, Empowering Girls and Young Women at High Risk of HIV Infection: A Capacity Strengthening Project is a project with locations in 15 different African countries that reaches girls and young women who have the highest risk of HIV transmission and provides them with resources to prevent the virus. The Council is constantly conducting research to find high risk populations and the most cost-effective ways to get them the treatment they lack. The Council partners in a project called Link Up that is based in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Myanmar, and Uganda, which focuses on the population of young people ages 10 to 24 who represent a large proportion of HIV infections. The Council's research and involvement in this project helped to implement more effective strategies for improving the sexual and reproductive health of these populations.  Gender-based violence  The Council helps to alleviate the harmful effects of sexual and gender-based violence by offering education to both men and women about domestic violence and provide programs to help victims. Programs like \\"Opening Opportunities\\" help to develop the social networks of girls who are most at risk of being involved in sexual or gender based violence, and also connects them with mentors to help them stay safe.  Public health data  The research that the Population Council conducts, and the publications it releases based on that research, contribute to the data that demographers and health officials require in order to promote public health. For instance, the Population Council was one of the first organizations to document statistics on HIV in Africa. The council also conducted the first study in India to assess the HIV risks that injecting drug users face. Their persistent efforts help to provide information about and combat public health disparities.

Her book I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did: Social Networks and the Death of Privacy (Free Press) was released in January 2012. In the book, she explains how individuals' rights are being violated and she proposes a Constitution for social networks and the Web.http://www.socialnetworkconstitution.com Andrews is the author of three mystery novels featuring a female geneticist and military lawyer. The Silent Assassin (2007), the second novel in the Dr. Alexandra Blake series, revolves around enemy skulls brought back from the Vietnam War by American soldiers and now stored in a drawer at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. This story line was based on six actual existing Vietnamese trophy skulls that are, in fact, stored in a drawer in Washington. On June 22, 2007, Andrews published an Op-Ed in the New York Times in response to the White House visit of Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet. She urged President Bush to return the \\"trophy skulls.\\" In September 2008, Andrews released the third installment of her mystery series, Immunity. The book involves a geneticist and DEA agent who works feverishly to stop an epidemic in the Southwest United States. A frequent guest on Nightline, 60 Minutes, CBS Morning News, Oprah, and various other programs, Andrews is often interviewed about bioethics. A documentary, \\"Frozen Angels,\\" which describes her work, premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival.

History The company started in 1948 by Earle Swensen, who learned to make ice cream while serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Swensen opened his first shop at the corner of Union and Hyde Streets, along the cable car tracks in Russian Hill in San Francisco at what had been a failed ice cream parlor. Although vanilla was his lifelong favorite, he developed more than 150 flavors, which he marketed under the motto \\"Good as Father Used to Make\\". The original store sold ice cream and other frozen dessert specialties (such as sundaes and banana splits), with primarily take out service. Later other Swensen's franchisees added indoor seating and offered various types of food, including sandwiches and hamburgers. Banana boat ice cream, Swensen's Mall of Asia, Manila, Philippines. Lamb Chop with almonds, Swensen's Singapore. Swensen sold the rights to franchise Swensen's Ice Cream Factories and Restaurants to William Meyer and investors in the 1970s but retained exclusive rights in San Francisco and continued to operate his original store (which still exists today) until 1994, a year before his death at age 83. Under new management the company expanded to 400 stores, mostly franchise locations, by the 1980s. However, in the 1990s it contracted to half of that size before being acquired and expanding again, mostly in Asia. USA stores continued to close until only three were left, of which one is the original San Francisco ice cream parlor and one is the main restaurant in Miami. Today the company is owned by International Franchise Corp (IFC) of Markham, Ontario, Canada, which bought the franchise business from former frozen food manufacturer CoolBrands International in 2006. IFC also owns such notable brands as Yogen Fr√ºz, I Can't Believe It's Yogurt (ICBY), Golden Swirl, Yogurty's, Dreamery and Bresler's Ice Cream. The Swensen's chain now includes about 300 franchise outlets worldwide including locations in Asia, the Middle East, the United States, South America, India, Taiwan, Singapore, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos and Pakistan. In India, the company opened its first store in Bangalore at Mantri Mall, marking the first of 80 stores over the next 5 years scheduled to open all over South India. Swensen's is also now open in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In March 2014, Swensen's opened its first restaurant in Yangon, Myanmar.http://mingalapar.com/forum/index.php/topic/1604-swensens-ice-cream- shop-to-open-in-junction-maw-tin/ In 1971, Hans Biermann opened a Swensen's in Santa Ana, CA. 18 years later he parted ways with Swensen's and changed the name to Hans‚Äô Homemade Ice Cream and Deli. He still uses the same basic Swensen's recipes and has opened stores in Anaheim and Huntington Beach.https://www.ocregister.com/2011/08/22/swensens-making-socal-comeback/ Popular culture Swensen's was featured as a prize on Super Sloppy Double Dare and on the 1987 Euro version of Finders Keepers and was featured in the 1985 film The Goonies.

Plot summary It tells the story of a black house maid working in a New York hotel and an eccentric alcoholic and prejudiced writer who is a frequent guest there. The maid consumes some of the writer's semen which was left on his sheets as part of a possible black magic spell, in the hope that it will pass talent and ability along to her unborn son. The story is told, in part, in the past tense. King's notes at the end of Nightmares & Dreamscapes state that this story turned out to be a sort of trial for his later novel Dolores Claiborne and that it was partly written to explore the idea of why famous and talented people can sometimes be horrible in real life. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations This story was made into two different Dollar Baby short films, both directed by female filmmakers. In 2017, Tyna Ezenma made the very first Dollar Baby of this story, something of a novelty as many stories on the list have accompanying films in the dozens.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7676540 Selina Sondermann adapted the story in the following year and set it in 2018 Berlin.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3312878/ See also * Stephen King short fiction bibliography Short stories by Stephen King Fantasy short stories 1989 short stories Notes ","title":"Dedication (short story)"},{"id":"4310897","title":"Refer (software)"},{"id":"4310913","text":"\\"The Moving Finger\\" is a horror short story by American writer Stephen King. It was first published in December 1990 in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, and three years later in 1993 was included in King's collection Nightmares & Dreamscapes. Plot summary A very ordinary man named Howard Mitla, who has a strange aptitude for Jeopardy!, is confronted by the bizarre sight of a human finger poking its way out of the drain in his apartment's bathroom sink. He tries to deny the reality of what is happening, but the solitary digit eventually proves to be infinitely long and multijointed, and capable of attacking him. Mitla burns it with a bottle of heavy-duty drain cleaner, then chops it off with a pair of electric hedge trimmers. Howard, after cutting up the finger, starts thinking about the creature to which it was attached. He realizes it really had multiple digits and that there were several openings in an average bathroom, and an ominous sound is heard from the toilet. Investigating reports of noise coming from Howard's apartment, the police arrive to find him lying in a daze next to the toilet. He tells them, \\"If you have to go to the bathroom, I definitely suggest you hold it.\\" The toilet lid pops up. The story ends with the officer lifting the lid after Howard asks, \\"Final Jeopardy. How much do you wish to wager?\\" Adaptations This story appeared in the 1991 series finale of the TV series Monsters. It starred Tom Noonan. Gilbert Cruz ranked The Moving Finger at number twenty- four out of twenty-seven in a list of King television adaptations.

It is owned by Trish MacDonald-Garber, whose family has owned the station for over 30 years. WMBN-FM The station signed on in 1967 at 96.7, only broadcasting with 3,000 watts and airing beautiful music. The station was originally WMBN-FM, owned by Les Biederman's Midwestern Broadcasting Company of Traverse City, Michigan, and mostly simulcasted WMBN-AM 1340. In the 1970s, Biederman wanted to boost the signals of his Traverse City stations, ordering him to divest most of his other properties due to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and regulations. He sold WMBN-AM/FM to Kenneth MacDonald of MacDonald Broadcasting, a friend of his who owned stations in Saginaw and later Lansing. MacDonald had a cottage in the Petoskey area, and accepted the offer to purchase WMBN. MacDonald trained his children, Andy, Ken, Jr. (aka \\"Mac\\") and Patricia (\\"Trish\\") to run successful stations like he did, and put young 20-something Trish in charge of WMBN. Under her rule, WMBN changed its call sign to WWPZ and flipped to an early version of the adult hits Jack FM format. WPZ played everything from oldies to classic rock, funk to Top 40 hits, mostly with Dennis Martin (Corpe) programming the station. They also aired The Larry King Show at night. WMBN, however, remained beautiful music, using the slogan \\"Michigan's Beautiful North.\\" WPZ also aired sports, like Tigers baseball. It was also around that time that WMBN-FM flipped to 96.3 and boosted its power to 100 kW. WMBN remained beautiful music throughout most of the 1980s, and got strong adults numbers in the Northwest Michigan ratings. The station was automated most of the time, including a voicetracked night shift from owner Ken MacDonald himself. Sadly, Ken passed in 1989, and for a while, the station still aired his taped show. Jim Scollin did a live morning drive show for many years in the 1980s. Lite 96 FM In 1990, Trish decided to flip WMBN-FM from beautiful music to Soft AC. The station's music became more contemporary, and aimed for a slightly younger audience. Meanwhile, the easy listening music found a new home on the AM dial at WMBN-AM 1340, which would move to Westwood One's \\"AM Only\\" format of adult standards (now known as America's Best Music and syndicated by Dial Global). In the mid-1990s, Trish purchased WWLZ 96.7 in Cadillac, Michigan, changing the station from CHR to a simulcast of WMBN-FM, which changed its call letters to WLXT to match its Lite 96 name. 96.7 became WLXV. In 2002, the WLXT/WLXV simulcast ended when Trish decided that Cadillac, a town with six stations and five of them being simulcasts of other stations (and the one that was not, WATT-AM 1240, being mainly syndicated talk), needed a music station to call its own. She flipped WLXV to a hot AC format as Mix 96. (In early 2003, WLXV gained a sister station also solely serving the Cadillac market in WKAD-FM \\"Oldies 93.7,\\" airing a syndicated 1960s/1970s oldies format from Jones Radio Networks - this format is now part of Dial Global's Kool Gold network.) After Christmas 2010, WLXV got competition in the form of Jennifer Theodore's 107.9 WCDY, giving Cadillac two hot AC stations. WLXT today Today, Lite 96 is the AC ratings leader in northern Michigan even though they have lost some audience to other stations such as former smooth jazz station WJZQ and former AC WSRT. WLXT is also the northern Michigan affiliate for the John Tesh Radio Show. The station aired Delilah's love-song dedication program at night for a short time after WSRT, northern Michigan's former Delilah affiliate, dropped its AC format for talk. WLXT also airs American Top 40: The '80s and the 1980s and 1990s editions of Backtrax USA during the weekends. Like many other AC stations across the country, WLXT flips to continuous Christmas music during the holiday season. In the fall of 2007 the station adjusted its on-air branding from \\"Lite 96\\" to \\"Lite 96.3,\\" possibly due to competitor Northern Radio flipping its Petoskey-area translator station at 95.3 to a simulcast of AC competitor WSRT. In May 2010, WSRT dropped its AC format and switched to a talk radio format, leaving WLXT as the only AC station in the market.

It was published in the compilation book Dark Visions and in his collection Nightmares & Dreamscapes. Plot summary Recording studio executive John Tell notices a pair of old dirty sneakers in an adjacent stall while using the restroom at work. He, at first, assumes that the shoes belong to a fellow employee or a delivery person. However, when he visits the bathroom again throughout the week, he notices that not only have the shoes not moved, they are now surrounded by the bodies of dead flies and other bugs. Eventually, Tell discovers that the shoes were the trademark of a dealer who supplied the local talent with cocaine, and who was killed in the bathroom stall during an apparent robbery. Tell finally confronts the man's ghost, who informs him that he was brutally killed by Jannings, Tell's boss, a drug addict who was heavily in debt to the dealer at the time. Jannings used the stolen cocaine to fund his rehabilitation and rise to executive management. This prompts Tell to quit his job, telling Jannings he is a \\"worthless bastard\\" before leaving. When he arrives home, he resolves to find other work, pulling out the want ads and reading them while doing his business on his own toilet.

It's the ninth episode of the fourth season. It was later included in King's 1993 short story collection Nightmares & Dreamscapes, and is the only such work that King has included in any of his anthologies. It appears in script format, and begins with an authors' guide for screenplays and abbreviations. The Tales from the Darkside episode originally aired in 1987, and starred Deborah Harmon and Arthur Taxier as Katie and Bill Weiderman, with Rhonda Dotson as Katie's sister Dawn and Katherine Britton, Brandon Stewart and Nicole Huntington as the Weiderman children. It was later produced as a short film in 2005, directed and adapted by Brian Berkowitz. The cast included Darrin Stevens, Karla Droege, Michael Brady, Kimberly D'Armond, Karoline Striplin, and Barbara Weetman. The title is a pun on the title of the radio play and film Sorry, Wrong Number. Plot summary Katie Weiredman is talking to her sister on the phone one night. Her husband, Bill, a famous horror novel writer, is in his study trying to find inspiration for a new novel. Her children are arguing about whether or not to watch Ghost Kiss, a gory TV adaptation of Bill's earlier novel. Katie receives a second phone call. The incoming call is a sobbing and traumatized caller who sputters, \\"Take... please take...\\" before the line goes dead. Katie immediately assumes the call came from her daughter Polly, who is away at boarding school, but a call to Polly proves otherwise. Katie also rules out her mother, but she cannot reach her sister Dawn. Katie and Bill rush over to Dawn's house; despite the appearance of forced entry, Dawn is all right and did not call. Assuming that someone must have dialed the wrong number, Katie forgets about the call. Later that night, Katie finds her husband slumped in his chair, dead from a heart attack. The story then jumps forward in time to Polly's wedding day, five years to the day after Bill's death. Katie has remarried, but she still misses Bill. On the anniversary of Bill's death, Katie is in Bill's old office and she finds an old VHS tape of Ghost Kiss and puts it into the player. She is immediately overcome with grief as she recalls the events of five years past. Insensate, she grabs the phone and dials her old phone number. She is startled when the phone is answered by herself five years previously. She tries to warn her younger self of the tragedy that is about to happen, and tries to say, \\"Take him to the hospital! If you want him to live, take him to the hospital! He's going to have a heart attack!\\" In her state of shock, she is only able to say, \\"Take... please take...,\\" before the line goes dead. She realizes the truth of what happened that night, and the episode ends with Katie sobbing over her lost opportunity to save her husband and a close-up shot of the ominous-looking telephone. Release The episode is available on VHS as part of volume 4 of the Tales from the Darkside compilation, as well as part of the complete collection released on DVD on October 19, 2010.

It is also allowed in cases of terminal disease or great disability. A similar practice exists in Jainism, termed Santhara.  Conditions and rules  Committing Prayopavesa is bound by very strict regulations. Only a person who has no desire or ambition left, and no responsibilities remaining in life is entitled to perform it. The decision to do so must be publicly declared well in advance. Ancient lawmakers stipulated the conditions that allow Prayopavesa. They are one's inability to perform normal bodily purification, death appears imminent or the condition is so bad that life's pleasures are nil and the action is done under community regulation.  Examples  It was when the king Parikshit was observing prayopavesa, that the Bhagavata Purana was narrated to him by the sage ≈öuka, son of Vyasa. In 1982, Acharya Vinoba Bhave (spiritual successor of Mahatma Gandhi) died by prayopavesa. In November 2001, Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami subjected himself to prayopavesa. Subramuniyaswami was diagnosed to be suffering from terminal intestinal cancer. He later died on the 32nd day of his fast.

Martial arts background =Escrima/Knife/Combat Judo= Began in 1946 at the age of eight. Instructors were Pete Rado and Tony Navarro, both of whom were Filipino Scouts and close combat instructors. Pete Rado taught Advincula escrima and Tony Navarro knife fighting. Later he trained with Loi Miranda in Alaska (1961). =Hindiandi Gung Fu= In 1961, after returning to Okinawa, Advincula encountered an Okinawan friend with whom he had worked during his prior active duty. The man, Nago Shinu, asked him if he would like to meet \\"#1 strong man on Okinawa\\". Advincula at first declined because he thought Nago was talking about a weight lifter and he had no interest. Nago explained that he was referring a man who had studied Martial Arts in China. When he found this out he agreed accepted the invitation. He and Gayle Beams, who was one of his students at the Anchorage Dojo (see Isshinryu section below) went with Nago to meet Kang Kaneshiro (Kinjo) in Hamada. Kaneshiro initially agreed to teach Advincula but not Beams. He later accepted Beams as a student as well after Advincula requested that he do so. Later, when Advincula began Ryu Kon Kai kobudo training with Kotaro Iha, he found out that one of the instructors in Iha's dojo, Aka Seiko, was a cousin of Kaneshiro. Advincula with Shimabuku =Shorin Ryu= Advincula began training in Shorinryu with Segin Nagamine at Kin Village, Okinawa in 1962. =Goju Ryu= Trained in Gojuryu with Kinei Nakasone and Masanobu Shinjo (Nakasone's teacher) beginning in 1963 at Kin village & at New Koza, Okinawa. =Uechi Ryu= Began studying Uechi-ryu from Kosuke Yonamine at Koza, Okinawa, 1975 after the death of Shimabuku. =Ryu Kon Kai Ryukyu Kobudo= In 1975 started training in Ryu Kon Kai kobudo from Kotaro Iha at Taba village, Okinawa. After Shimabuku died, Advincula's brother in law asked him if he would like to continue his kobudo training with Iha, his friend. He has continued his relationship with Iha to this day and he was promoted to Nanadan and received his Shihan Menkyo (Instructors License) in Ryukonkai Kobudo from Iha in September 2009. =Isshinryu= Advincula was first stationed on Okinawa in late November 1958. After he had completed his check in sheet and was reporting to his NCOIC he saw a sign for judo classes and he asked the NCOIC about the classes. The NCOIC, who was a Green Belt in Isshinryu, asked him if he would like to try karate and told Advincula that he would take him to meet \\"Papasan\\" on Advincula's first liberty. Advincula accepted the invitation and on December 1, 1958, he went to the Agena Dojo and met Shimabuku for the first time. Advincula trained with Shimabuku regularly until his departure from Okinawa nearly fourteen months later. After returning to Alaska in April 1960 he opened his first dojo in Anchorage, teaching out of a health club facility. Advincula returned to Okinawa as a civilian on January 2, 1961. He once again began training with Shimabuku at the Agena Dojo. It was during this period that Advincula received the consent of Shimabuku to design and have made the Isshinryu Megami patch. This is the only patch that is known to have been approved by Shimabuku. Around May 1961 Advincula returned to Alaska but shortly thereafter (25 September 1961) he re-enlisted for active duty and he returned to Okinawa in November 1961. He continued his Isshinryu training with Shimabuku at this time. In late 1964 Advincula was reassigned to Camp Pendleton and he returned to California, where he opened a dojo in Carlsbad, California, with H. Mitchum. In August 1965 he was deployed to the Republic of Vietnam to serve a 12-month tour (see Military Background). He returned to California once again in August 1966. In February 1969 he returned to Vietnam for his second tour of duty. After he sustained an injury he was med-evaced to Okinawa and assigned to Casual Company, Camp Butler. He continued his training with Shimabuku once again. Upon completion of his tour Advincula was assigned to Parris Island, SC from April 1970 until January 1975 at which time he was once again stationed on Okinawa. It was during this period, on May 1, that Kichiro Shimabuku opened his Kinaka dojo and hosted a Grand Opening. Advincula encouraged Shimabuku to attend and one of the last pictures of Shimabuku was taken as he left the event.

Martial arts legacy Advincula receiving Shimabuku's bo-cover from Shinsho Shimabuku 4/15/1999 Advincula receiving Shimabuku's bo cover 4/15/1999 Advincula began hosting Okinawan cultural tours in April 1994. He takes small groups to Okinawa to meet, train and socialize with friends, family and Okinawan Martial Artists. One of the primary purposes of the tours is to give those participating an opportunity to learn about and experience the culture of Okinawa, as his teacher, Shimabuku requested: \\"Even if we cannot promote friendship between Okinawa and America through karate, my true hope is that if karate becomes popular in the U.S.A. and Hawaii, then Okinawa would also become more well understood.\\"Okinawa Times \\"Karate Boom Among Soldiers\\", Tatsuo Shimabuku, 4/30/1960. On one of these tours, April 15, 1999, Shimabuku's second son Shinsho (Ciso) presented Advincula with his father's bo cover. In January 2005 the government of Okinawa held the \\"Okinawa Karate and Kobudo Exchange Symposium\\". This symposium was organized to educate and demonstrate the difference between Japanese and Okinawan karate. Guests were invited from several of the different prefectures in Japan, and one guest from each of the following countries Argentina, France, Germany, Iraq, and Advincula from the United States. Only five people from outside of Okinawa and Japan were to selected to attend and he was one of them. Additional accomplishments A.J. Advincula and J.

The house seems to take on a life of its own as new wings are added, growing in a way that seems proportionate to the awful events that occurred there. The new wings added seem to be connected to the deaths of men who, as boys, were molested by the house owner's wife. The story also serves somewhat as an epilogue to Needful Things, as stated by Stephen King himself.

History The company's origins were based on vehicle manufacture. Originally called B√ºssing Hellas (after the German manufacturer whose engines it used) it was founded in 1957 succeeding earlier trading companies founded by the same family. Initially building bodies on imported chassis, it soon developed its own chassis family (originally based on a German MAN model, the latter having acquired B√ºssing). The company's SS500 chassis ('SS' standing for 'Stratis Sfakianakis') was subsequently further developed, and a great variety of bus types was designed and built over it in the following years in the company's factory near Elefsina, with exports to Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Other industrial activities included construction of truck bodies and Japanese Hino chassis assembly. The company was renamed Sfakianakis S.A. in 1993 and among the last types it designed and produced were the SS400 and SS380 minibuses and a new series of SS500 inter- city and coach variants. Industrial division The Sfakianakis industrial division had managed to survive for decades without any state support, despite fierce competition from imports; a flood of cheaper imports, though, eventually made bus manufacture unprofitable. This division was greatly shrunk in 2006, after the group had very successfully diversified into other business areas including vehicle import and sales and the services sector. Sfakianakis SA was established in 1957 and remains family owned. With 500,000 customers and EUR500m revenues in 2009, Sfakianakis is now the largest automotive group in Greece, leading the market in automotive retail across eight businesses in Greece, Bulgaria and the Republic of Northern Macedonia. Specialist services include the import and distribution of automobiles, motorcycles, trucks and buses, the import and distribution of machinery for the construction, industrial and agricultural sectors, and a network of 24 dealerships retailing brands including Suzuki, BMW, Mini, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Abarth, Nissan, Volvo, Ford, Opel, Renault, Dacia and Cadillac. Sfakianakis, through its Executive Lease car rental division, represents Enterprise Rent-A-Car in Greece and thirteen other countries, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia. The conglomerate is also active in the mailing sector through its Speedex courier company, with 7 million yearly deliveries through 200 distribution centers servicing 14,000 destinations in 220 countries around the world. Speedex operates through 1,400 highly trained individuals with a fleet of 300 trucks and 700 motorcycles. It also makes air cargo deliveries to island destinations through Express Cargo.

This story is King's foray into Sherlockiana, a non-canonical Sherlock Holmes story, using Arthur Conan Doyle's characters. Like his story \\"Crouch End\\", inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, \\"The Doctor's Case\\" is an example of a pastiche. Plot summary Dr. Watson narrates a heretofore unreleased case in which he and Holmes are called by Inspector Lestrade on an unexpectedly rainy day to investigate the murder of the sadistic Lord Hull. Each member of Hull's family - his wife and three sons - has reason to murder him; his wife and bowlegged son suffered from constant abuse, while another son was doomed to never receive more than a pittance, due to his placement in the family line. Furthermore, Hull's family endured his treatment in the hopes that he would leave them with his considerable wealth; however, they had recently learned that Hull had rewritten his will so that none of them received a thing. Despite these motives, the family have effectively given each other alibis and the murder itself is effectively a locked room mystery; there's no place in Hull's study for anyone to hide without being seen, and all the doors and windows were locked by the lord himself. Holmes is eager to solve this mystery, but is allergic to Hull's numerous cats. Watson, however, notices that a certain table in the locked study casts odd shadows on the rug. When he goes to check the table, he discovers an illusion and demonstrates that the table has been rigged. The bookshelf's lowest shelf is, in fact, a photorealistic painting. The murderer, Hull's artist son Jory, had perfectly rendered the bottom shelf, then pasted the results against the back table-legs. When his father announced the new will, Jory made into the study, crouched behind the table, and rushed out to stab his father at the right moment. A cursory glance would not betray the illusion on a dark day, but on a sunny one, the lack of shadows being cast by the table-legs would have been noticeable. To help make the illusion perfect, Jory had prepared shadows out of black felt, and laid them down at roughly the place where shadows should be. Unfortunately, he was \\"caught by shadows on a day when there should be none\\". Furthermore, Hull had time to scream before he died, arousing the attention of his servants and making it impossible for Jory to either collect his paintings or frame the murder as a break-in gone wrong. Instead, Jory stole and burnt the new will, guaranteeing that he and his family would receive their inheritance. As Watson explains his insights, he slowly comes to the realization that Jory could not have executed the murder on his own and that, at the very least, everyone in the family knew of it and was lying for him. Holmes, who had already reached that conclusion while listening to Watson's narrative, gently chides him for his inability to understand the depths of human depravity. Watson also realizes that Holmes had understood everything not long from the beginning of Watson's story, yet deliberately kept his silence, letting Watson have his moment in the sun; rather than resenting his thunder being stolen, Holmes was genuinely impressed with the \\"deductive light\\" Watson demonstrated. Holmes and Lestrade discuss the various sentences that the Hulls will receive if the case is brought before court; Jory is guaranteed an execution, whilst the other two sons would be jailed for life and the wife jailed for some time in a women's prison. They eventually decide that the world is, perhaps, better off without Hull in it, and thus conspire to conceal the truth of what has occurred; Holmes and Watson collect the painting and the shadows, while Lestrade unlocks one of the windows in the room; they leave, and inform the waiting police that Hull was murdered in an attempted break-in.

Television Carmen Aristegui, Mexican journalist, during a hunger strike by former workers of a public power company (Luz y Fuerza del Centro) at Mexico City's main plaza. She began her television career on Channel 13, then Imevisi√≥n (currently TV Azteca) as an assistant on the financial-news program Monitor Financiero, hosted by Efr√©n Flores. Later she was on Imevisi√≥n's team of journalists. According to a profile in Quien, Aristegui's \\"communication skills and her tenacity at work ensured that she came to be part of the team of news readers and reporters on the more than fifteen daily news programs broadcast by Imevisi√≥n on its five or six channels. Before long, she and Javier Sol√≥rzano ranked as the cornerstones of the 7 AM news broadcast on channel 13.\\" She worked on the program En Blanco y Negro alongside Javier Sol√≥rzano, broadcast by MVS, and in 2001 was also on C√≠rculo Rojo on Televisa. She worked on the news program Noticias Canal 52: Aristegui-Sol√≥rzano, broadcast on channel 52MX, from 2003 to 2006. In 2005, after more than 15 years of working together at various media (Imevisi√≥n, MVS, Imagen, Televisa, Canal 52), Aristegui and Sol√≥rzano announced that they would be separating professionally on account of \\"conflicting schedules\\". In addition, she worked on the channel 11 program Primer Plano. For over 5 years she hosted the program Partidos Pol√≠ticos. Since 2005 she has been the host of the interview program Aristegui, broadcast on CNN en Espa√±ol. Radio Aristegui has worked for various radio stations, including Radio Educaci√≥n, FM Globo and Stereorey. Among the programs in which she has taken part are Para Empezar (\\"To Begin With\\") on MVS Radio, and the early broadcast of Imagen Informativa (\\"Informative Image\\") on Grupo Imagen, on which she was a regular until November 2002, when she had a conflict with Pedro Ferr√≠z de Con, who did not allow her to enter the studio to broadcast the show. After this incident, she and Javier Sol√≥rzano chose to depart from Grupo Imagen. In an act of solidarity, the hosts of the later broadcasts of Imagen Informativa, Ilana Sod, Julio Boltvinik, Denise Dresser, and Vivian Hiriart also quit. =Hoy por Hoy= During a panel at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara in 2017. Aristegui hosted the program Hoy por Hoy (\\"Nowadays\\") on W Radio until 4 January 2008, when, after several months that had been marked by increased tensions between herself and her employers about the extent to which she should be allowed to express certain opinions, she parted ways with the network, citing differences over its planned changes in editorial direction. \\"Early in December 2007,\\" Aristegui said, \\"I was informed of the network's desire not to renew my contract, but they left open the possibility of staying on. The network notified me that they sought to change the contractual conditions in some respects, incorporating some changes in editorial direction...We discussed it and looked forward to specific proposals, but in the end it didn't happen.\\" In her final broadcast, she said that she had been surprised by the news of her termination. The split coincided with the March 2007 appointment of Daniel Moreno, who was close to the wife of Zavala and former president Vicente Fox's wife Marta Sahag√∫n, as director of W. Though Hoy por Hoy had attained its highest audience levels ever with Aristegui at the helm, beginning in 2007, Aristegui was conspicuously omitted from the list of electronic journalists who were granted interviews with the Mexican president. On 5 January 2008, La Jornada reported that after the show's final broadcast, Aristegui received applause from station workers, lasting for several minutes. Hosts of the stations Ke-Buena, Los 40 Principales and B√©same Mucho, which broadcast from the same building, also gathered there to applaud the journalist's work. Outside, listeners gathered spontaneously to protest Aristegui's firing, some of them carrying signs reading \\"Long live our right to information!\\", \\"We will not be silenced! Long live our freedom of expression!\\" and \\"Carmen, we are with you, because Mexico needs valiant and principled journalists like you.\\" Voces Silenciadas (\\"Silenced Voices\\"), a 2009 documentary by Maria del Carmen De Lara about the persecution of journalists in Mexico and the relationship between the Mexican media and politicians, used Aristegui's departure from W Radio as its starting point. De Lara stated publicly that the Aristegui case showed how concentrated media ownership in Mexico had narrowed the range of permissible opinions in Mexico's media. =Noticias MVS= MVS Radio and Aristegui reached an agreement in early 2009 to begin a new radio show on Noticias MVS. The daily show, which began airing in January 2009, dealt with issues in much greater depth than her twenty-minute TV show for CNN. On 6 July 2009 (the day of the 2009 midterm elections) the program also began broadcasting on channel 52MX, which also belongs to MVS. Guests on this program included various Mexican political figures, such as Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador and Roberto Madrazo Pintado. The show featured an interview with former president Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado in which he expressed disappointment in his successor, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, because of the latter's family corruption and links to drug cartels. =Firing and reinstatement at MVS= Carmen Aristegui. On 4 February 2011, on her MVS program, Aristegui reported an incident that had occurred on the previous day in the Chamber of Deputies. Opposition deputies had displayed a banner reading: \\"Would you let a drunk drive your car? No, right? So why let one run your country?\\" Aristegui commented on her news program that while she didn't \\"have any specific information\\" as to whether the president had problems with alcohol, she added \\"this is a delicate topic\\" and suggested that President Calder√≥n had an obligation to reply to the charge. On 7 February MVS, citing Aristegui's comments, terminated her contract purportedly \\"for violating the ethical code\\" of the firm. \\"In our code of ethics,\\" MVS said in a statement, \\"we pledge to reject the presentation and dissemination of rumors as news. The journalist Carmen Aristegui violated our code of ethics and we decided to terminate our existing contractual relationship.\\" The termination resulted in widespread public protests, and Aristegui was reinstated a few days later. Neither she nor MVS Radio issued an official statement about her return to the air. A CNN report in August 2012, revealed the behind-the-scenes story of the firing and rehiring. On 4 February, shortly after Aristegui's on-air comments about President's Calder√≥n's possible alcoholism, MVS president Joaquin Vargas received a phone call from Calder√≥n's spokeswoman, Alejandra Sota. Vargas apologized for Aristegui's comment, and later that day was told by a cabinet official that the government would not be taking action on a matter involving MVS's broadcast frequencies until Aristegui herself offered a public apology. On 5 February, Sota handed Vargas a statement of apology and told him to instruct Aristegui to read it on the air. On 6 February, Aristegui refused; Vargas fired her immediately. Her termination was announced that evening, and within hours Sota phoned Vargas and told him she was alarmed by the intense reaction on social networks to the news of Aristegui's dismissal. After several days of public outcry and of extensive communication between Vargas and various representatives of Calder√≥n, Aristegui returned to the air on February 21. =Second firing from MVS= On 12 March 2015, two journalists from MVS, Daniel Liz√°rraga and Irving Huerta, were fired after they used the station's brand name without permission in a newly created website known as MexicoLeaks, which leaked reports on government corruption. Aristegui issued an ultimatum and threaten to quit if MVS did not reinstate her two staff members. Four days later, MVS fired Aristegui after considering that she had crossed the line for issuing an ultimatum to the MVS management. Because the two journalists fired were part of an investigatory group that revealed the \\"white house scandal\\", a presidential scandal that involved the First Lady buying a house from a government contractor, many outlets commented on a possible conflict of interest. Both the Mexican government and MVS, however, stated that Aristegui's departure was due to internal disagreements between her and the MVS management. Aristegui said that she had plans to pursue legal action against MVS. Thousands of people gathered outside the MVS installations that day asking for Aristegui's reinstatement and criticizing MVS for firing her. On March 17, two more journalists from MVS, Ame Motta and Adriana Buentello, were fired after the management decided to cut personnel. On social media, the two journalists expressed their doubts about MVS's rationale and claimed it was due to them backing Aristegui. On 21 June 2018, a federal court ruled that the 2015 dismissal of Carmen Aristegui from the MVS radio group was \\"illegal and improper\\". =Grupo Radio Centro= On September 28, 2018, Grupo Radio Centro and Aristegui announced an alliance in which the journalist's Internet newscast would be broadcast over XERC-FM and other stations in several states of Mexico, beginning in October 17. Print media Aristegui worked for El Universal, for which she co-wrote the column \\"C√≠rculo rojo\\" with Javier Sol√≥rzano. As of 2013 she writes a column for Reforma. Aristegui's first book, Uno De Dos 2006: Mexico en la Encrucijada (\\"One of Two 2006: Mexico at the Crossroads\\"), profiles President Felipe Calder√≥n Hinojosa and Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, the leading presidential candidates in that year's federal election in Mexico. She explained that she had written the book in order to offer readers \\"a very interesting overview and X-ray of the country\\" and to provide insights into the ways the candidates had resolved specific situations in the past, which might offer clues as to how they would behave in office. Other work For over five years, Aristegui hosted the Federal Electoral Institute's special political programming. In 1997, she acted as an advisor to a civic group involved in the first election for mayor of Mexico City. She regularly participates in several academic forums and debates. She was selected to carry the Olympic torch through part of Mexico while it was on its worldwide journey to Athens in 2004. Aristegui gave a lecture on \\"Mexico's Democratic Transition\\" in the series Dialogues with Mexico/Di√°logos con M√©xico on 20 January 2010 at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. In April 2012, Aristegui launched her Twitter account, @aristeguionline, and within a day she had more than 70,000 followers. The same month saw the launch of Aristeguinoticias.com, a news and analysis site. In 2004, on the Canal 52 MVS evening news, Aristegui uncovered the first video scandal of the year, concerning Green Party leader Jorge Emilio Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez's involvement in a tourist development in Canc√∫n. Aristegui has long been critical of the Television Law, which favors the televised media duopoly in Mexico consisting of Grupo Televisa and TV Azteca. Aristegui has closely followed the case of Ernestina Ascensi√≥n Rosario, an indigenous resident of Zongolica in the state of Veracruz, who allegedly died as a result of a gang rape by Mexican soldiers. The National Commission of Human Rights, chaired by Jos√© Luis Soberanes Fern√°ndez, declared that this purported crime never took place. Aristegui's program was the first to report on the phone calls between the governor of Puebla, Mario Mar√≠n Torres, and textile executive Kamel Nacif Borge, who colluded to deprive journalist Lydia Cacho of her liberties because of her denunciation of a pedophile ring in her book Los Demonios del Ed√©n. Aristegui has also extensively covered the clerical sexual abuse of minors, including the case of Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera, who was charged in the Superior Courts of California of international conspiracy for allegedly protecting Fr. Nicol√°s Aguilar, who had been accused of pedophilia. The journalist Sanjuana Mart√≠nez investigated the cases and wrote about them in her books Manto P√∫rpura and Prueba de Fe. Aristegui also investigated the life of Marcial Maciel and the many cases of pedophilia in which he was involved, and questioned his beatification by Pope John Paul II. Awards and honors Aristegui during the presentation of her book Marcial Maciel, A Criminal History. The School of Journalism at Columbia University, which awards the Maria Moors Cabot Prize, explained its selection of Aristegui as follows: \\"Aristegui gives voice to Mexicans who would otherwise not be heard or seen because they criticize the country's most powerful institutions. The heat generated by her morning talk show on W Radio, 'Hoy por Hoy,' led to Aristegui's forced departure. Aristegui continues to explain, celebrate, and expose what is great and wrong in Mexico ‚Äî and in the hemisphere ‚Äî on her CNN en Espa√±ol show, 'Aristegui,' and in her column in the newspaper Reforma. Her courage serves as an example for journalists, especially women, fighting to make their voices heard.\\" Upon accepting the prize, she dedicated it to her son and spoke about her firing by W Radio, saying that the incident \\"showed just how frail a journalist can be.\\" Adding that \\"a country cannot be truly democratic when two companies control 94 %\\" of the media, she called Mexico \\"a high-risk country for our profession.\\"Cabot speech On being presented with the Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz Prize, Aristegui dedicated it to the writer Germ√°n Dehesa, who had died the previous September, and to the 64 reporters killed in recent years for exercising their freedom of expression. \\"Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz,\\" said Aristegui, \\"is a key character, transcendent, transformative, a kind of myth. Sor Juana's life was devoted to study, to the pursuit of knowledge, not only in order to understand, unravel and know, but precisely to make possible a window on liberty.\\" The French government awarded Aristegui the Legion of Honor in recognition of her \\"struggle for freedom of expression, and her commitment to the defense of those who often have no voice in the media, as well as her work for democracy and rule of law in Mexico.\\" Aristegui has received the following awards and honors: *2001 ‚Äì National Award for Journalism (shared with Javier Sol√≥rzano) *2002 ‚Äì Recognized by the Mexican Center for Philanthropy *2002 ‚Äì Mexican Press Club, National Journalism Award *2003 ‚Äì Named Best National Anchor *2003 ‚Äì Public Image Prize for Best Journalist at National Level *2004 ‚Äì Mexican Press Club, National Journalism Award *2004 ‚Äì National Award for Journalism *2004 ‚Äì Mont Blanc Woman of the YearMundo52. ‚ÄúDan trofeo a la mujer.‚Äù *2005 ‚Äì Honored by the National Institute of Indigenous Languages *2005 ‚Äì National Award for Journalism *2006 - Omecihauatl Medal, from the Instituto de las Mujeres- DFCIMAC Noticias. ‚ÄúPremio Omecihauatl a Carmen Aristegui‚Äù *2006 - Ondas Iberoamericano Radio Prize, for the program Hoy por hoyLa Jornada. ‚ÄúCarmen Aristegui recibe el premio Ondas‚Äù *2006 ‚Äì Mexican Journalism Prize, awarded by the Fifth National Congress of the Federation of Mexican Journalists' Associations, in the category of interviewing *2008 - Mar√≠a Moors Cabot Prize from the School of Journalism at Columbia University *2009 ‚Äì National Award for Journalism *2010 ‚Äì National Award for Journalism *2010 ‚Äì Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz Prize *2012 ‚Äì Named a Chevalier of the French Legion of HonorLa Jornada. \\"Legi√≥n de Honor para Aristegui\\" *2014 - PEN Mexico PrizeMexico: PEN laments dismissal of journalist Carmen Aristegui * 2015 - Gabriel Garc√≠a Marquez Prize, for research on \\"The White House\\". * 2016 - Chosen as one of BBC's 100 Women2016 , BBC, Retrieved 24 November 2016 * 2017 - Chosen as one of 50 \\"World's greatest leaders\\" by Fortune magazine. * 2018 - Received the John Peter and Anna Catherine Zenger Award for Press Freedom from the University of Arizona School of Journalism.

According to historian Yehuda Bauer, Jewish resistance was defined as actions that were taken against all laws and actions acted by Germans.Yehuda Bauer, \\"Unanswered Questions: Nazi Germany and the Genocide of the Jews,\\" Jewish Resistance and Passivity in the Face of the Holocaust, 1989, p.237 The term is particularly connected with the Holocaust and includes a multitude of different social responses by those oppressed, as well as both passive and armed resistance conducted by Jews themselves. Due to military strength of Nazi Germany and its allies, as well as the administrative system of ghettoization and the hostility of various sections of the civilian population, few Jews were able to effectively resist the Final Solution militarily. Nevertheless, there are many cases of attempts at resistance in one form or another including over a hundred armed Jewish uprisings.Jewish Partisan Education Foundation, Accessed 22 December 2013. Historiographically, the study of Jewish resistance to German rule is considered an important aspect of the study of the Holocaust. Concepts and definitions The historian Julian Jackson argued that there were three discrete forms of Jewish resistance in the course of his study of the German occupation of France: > \\"One can distinguish three categories of Jewish resistance: first, > individual French Jews in the general Resistance; secondly, specifically > Jewish organizations in the general Resistance; thirdly, Resistance > organizations (not necessarily comprising Jews alone) with specifically > Jewish objectives.\\" In his book The Holocaust: The Jewish Tragedy, Martin Gilbert defines Jewish resistance more widely: > \\"In every ghetto, in every deportation train, in every labor camp, even in > the death camps, the will to resist was strong, and took many forms. > Fighting with the few weapons that would be found, individual acts of > defiance and protest, the courage of obtaining food and water under the > threat of death, the superiority of refusing to allow the Germans their > final wish to gloat over panic and despair. Even passivity was a form of > resistance. To die with dignity was a form of resistance. To resist the > demoralizing, brutalizing force of evil, to refuse to be reduced to the > level of animals, to live through the torment, to outlive the tormentors, > these too were acts of resistance. Merely to give a witness of these events > in testimony was, in the end, a contribution to victory. Simply to survive > was a victory of the human spirit.\\"Gilbert, Martin. \\"The Holocaust: The > Jewish Tragedy\\". London: St Edmundsbury Press 1986. This view is supported by Yehuda Bauer, who wrote that resistance to the Nazis comprised not only physical opposition, but any activity that gave the Jewish people dignity and humanity despite the humiliating and inhumane conditions. Bauer disputes the popular view that most Jews went to their deaths passively‚Äî\\"like sheep to the slaughter\\". He argues that, given the conditions in which the Jews of Eastern Europe had to live under and endure, what is surprising is not how little resistance there was, but rather how much resistance was present. Types of resistance = Ghettos across German- occupied Poland= In 1940, the Warsaw ghetto was cut off from its access to Polish underground newspapers, and the only newspaper allowed to be imported into the confines of the ghetto was the General Government propaganda organ Gazeta ≈ªydowska. As a result, from roughly May 1940 to October 1941, the Jews of the ghetto published their own underground newspapers, offering hopeful news about the war and prospects for the future. The most prominent of these were published by the Jewish Socialist party and the Zionist Labor Movement. These two groups formed an alliance but they had no arms. These papers lamented the carnage of war, but for the most part did not encourage armed resistance.Leni Yahil. \\"The Warsaw Ghetto Underground Press\\". In Robert Moses Shapiro, ed., Why Didn't the Press Shout? Yeshiva University Press, 2003. pp. 457-490 Jews mainly used unarmed resistance in Eastern Europe; for instance, young Jews smuggled food or secretly took people into the forests in Sobib√≥r and Treblinka death camps, whereas in Western Europe, they used armed resistance.Yehuda Bauer, \\"Unanswered Questions: Nazi Germany and the Genocide of the Jews,\\" Jewish Resistance and Passivity in the Face of the Holocaust, 1989, p.243 Between April and May 1943, Jewish men and women of the Warsaw Ghetto took up arms and rebelled against the Nazis after it became clear that the Germans were deporting remaining Ghetto inhabitants to the Treblinka extermination camp. Warsaw Jews of the Jewish Combat Organization and the Jewish Military Union fought the Germans with a handful of small arms and Molotov cocktails, as Polish resistance attacked from the outside in support. After fierce fighting, vastly superior German forces pacified the Warsaw Ghetto and either murdered or deported all of the remaining inhabitants to the Nazi killing centers. Note: Chariton and Lazar were never co-authors of Wdowi≈Ñski's memoir. Wdowi≈Ñski is considered the \\"single author.\\" The Germans claimed that they lost 18 dead and 85 wounded, though this figure has been disputed, with resistance leader Marek Edelman estimating 300 German casualties. Some 13,000 Jews were killed, and 56,885 were deported to concentration camps. There are two main reasons why Jews failed to resist when they were leaving the ghettos: Nazis' powerful army and also, it was difficult for Jews to get armed resistance because they needed others' support and because they lacked the ability to get arms when they were in ghettos. There were many other major and minor ghetto uprisings, however most were not successful. Some of the ghetto uprisings include the Bia≈Çystok Ghetto Uprising and the Czƒôstochowa Ghetto Uprising. =Concentration Camps= Smoke rising from Treblinka extermination camp during the prisoner uprising of August 1943 There were major resistance efforts in three of the extermination camps. * In August 1943, an uprising took place at the Treblinka extermination camp. The participants obtained guns and grenades after two young men used forged keys and snuck into the armory unit. The weapons were then distributed around the camp in garbage bins. However, during the distribution of arms, a Nazi guard stopped a prisoner and found contraband money on him. Fearing that the prisoner would be tortured and give away the plan, the organizers decided to launch the revolt ahead of schedule without completing the distribution of weapons, and set off a single grenade‚Äîthe agreed-upon signal for the uprising. The prisoners then attacked the Nazi guards with guns and grenades. Several German and Ukrainian guards were killed, a fuel tank was set on fire, barracks and warehouses were burned, military vehicles were disabled, and grenades were thrown at the SS headquarters. The guards replied with machine-gun fire, and 1,500 inmates were killed‚Äîbut 70 inmates escaped to freedom. The guards chased those who had escaped on horseback and in cars, but some of those who escaped were armed, and returned the guards' fire. Gassing operations at the camp were interrupted for a month.Omer-Man, Michael. \\"This Week in History: Prisoners revolt at Treblinka\\" Jerusalem Post, Aug. 5, 2011. Accessed 23 December 2013. * In October 1943, an uprising took place at Sobib√≥r extermination camp, led by Polish-Jewish prisoner Leon Feldhendler and Soviet-Jewish POW Alexander Pechersky. The inmates covertly killed 12 German SS officers, including the deputy commander, and a number of Ukrainian guards. Although the plan was to kill all of SS members and walk out of the main gate of the camp, the guards discovered the killings and opened fire. The inmates then had to run for freedom under fire, with roughly 300 of the 600 inmates in the camp escaping alive. All but 50‚Äì70 of the inmates were killed in the surrounding minefields or recaptured and murdered by the Germans. However, the escape forced the Nazis to close the camp, saving countless lives.Raschke, Richard. Escape from Sobibor. New York: Avon, 1982. * On October 7, 1944, the Jewish Sonderkommandos (inmates kept separate from the main camp and put to work in the gas chambers and crematoria) at Auschwitz staged an uprising. Female inmates had smuggled in explosives from a weapons factory, and Crematorium IV was partly destroyed by an explosion. At this stage they were joined by the Birkenau One Kommando, which also overpowered their guards and broke out of the compound. The inmates then attempted a mass escape, but were stopped by heavy fire. Three guards were killed in the uprising, including an Oberkapo who was pushed alive into an oven. Almost all of the 250 escapees were killed. There were also international plans for a general uprising in Auschwitz, coordinated with an Allied air raid and a Polish resistance attack from the outside. =Partisan groups= There were a number of Jewish partisan groups operating in many countries, especially Poland. The most notable of the groups is the Bielski partisans, whom the movie Defiance portrays, and the Parczew partisans in the forests near Lublin, Poland. Hundreds of Jews escaped the ghettoes and joined the Partisan resistance groups. Jewish resistance in German-occupied Europe by country =Belgium= Belgian resistance to the treatment of Jews crystallised between August‚ÄìSeptember 1942, following the passing of legislation regarding wearing yellow badges and the start of the deportations. When deportations began, Jewish partisans destroyed records of Jews compiled by the AJB. The first organization specifically devoted to hiding Jews, the (CDJ-JVD), was formed in the summer of 1942. The CDJ, a left- wing organization, may have saved up to 4,000 children and 10,000 adults by finding them safe hiding places. It produced two Yiddish language underground newspapers, (\\"Our Word\\", with a Labour-Zionist stance) and (\\"Our Fight\\", with a Communist one). The CDJ was only one of dozens of organised resistance groups that provided support to hidden Jews. Other groups and individual resistance members were responsible for finding hiding places and providing food and forged papers. Many Jews in hiding went on to join organised resistance groups. Groups from left wing backgrounds, like the (FI-OF), were particularly popular with Belgian Jews. The Communist-inspired (PA) had a particularly large Jewish section in Brussels. The resistance was responsible for the assassination of Robert Holzinger, the head of the deportation program, in 1942. Holzinger, an active collaborator, was an Austrian Jew selected by the Germans for the role. The assassination led to a change in leadership of the AJB. Five Jewish leaders, including the head of the AJB, were arrested and interned in Breendonk, but were released after public outcry. A sixth was deported directly to Auschwitz. The Belgian resistance was unusually well informed on the fate of the deported Jews. In August 1942 (two months after the start of the Belgian deportations), the underground newspaper reported that \\"They [the deported Jews] are being killed in groups by gas, and others are killed by salvos of machinegun fire.\\" In early 1943, the sent Victor Martin, an academic economist at the Catholic University of Louvain, to gather information on the fate of deported Belgian Jews using the cover of his research post at the University of Cologne. Martin visited Auschwitz and witnessed the crematoria. Arrested by the Germans, he escaped, and was able to report his findings to the CDJ in May 1943. =France= Ariadna Scriabina, co-founder of Arm√©e Juive Despite amounting to only 1% of the French population, Jews comprised about 15-20% of the French Resistance.According to Serge Klarsfeld, there were 175 Jews among the 1008 Resistance members executed at Mont-Val√©rien, near Paris, or 17,4%. Quoted by Monique-Lise Cohen et Jean-Louis Dufour in \\"Les Juifs dans la R√©sistance\\", Publisher: Tir√©sias, 2001) Some of the Jewish resistance members were refugees from Germany, Poland and other central European states.http://www.cheminsdememoire.gouv.fr/fr/les- etrangers-dans-la-resistance Although the majority of the French and foreign Jews involved in the French Resistance participated in the general Resistance movements, some Jews also set up their own armed resistance movement: the Arm√©e Juive (Jewish Army), a Zionist organization, which at its height, numbered some 2,000 fighters. Operating throughout France, it smuggled hundreds of Jews to Spain and Switzerland, launched attacks against occupying German forces, and targeted Nazi informants and Gestapo agents. Armee Juive participated in the general French uprising of August 1944, fighting in Paris, Lyon, and Toulouse. =Germany= Jewish resistance within Germany itself during the Nazi era took a variety of forms, from sabotage and disruptions to providing intelligence to Allied forces, distributing anti-Nazi propaganda, as well as participating in attempts to assist Jewish emigration out of Nazi- controlled territories. It has been argued that, for Jews during the Holocaust, given the intent of the Nazi regime to exterminate Jews, survival itself constituted an act considered a form of resistance.Ruby Rohrlich, ed. Resisting the Holocaust. Oxford and New York: Berg Publishers, 1998. Jewish participation in the German resistance was largely confined to the underground activities of left-wing Zionist groups such as Werkleute, Hashomer Hatzair and Habonim, and the German Social Democrats, Communists, and independent left- wing groups such as the New Beginning. Much of the non-left wing and non- Jewish opposition to Hitler in Germany (i.e., conservative and religious forces), although often opposed to the Nazi plans for extermination of German and European Jewry, in many instances itself harbored anti-Jewish sentiments.Theodore S. Hamerow (1997), On the Road to the Wolf's Lair: German Resistance to Hitler. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. . A celebrated case involved the arrest and execution of Helmut Hirsch, a Jewish architectural student originally from Stuttgart, in connection with a plot to bomb Nazi Party headquarters in Nuremberg. Hirsch became involved in the Black Front, a breakaway faction from the Nazi Party led by Otto Strasser. After being captured by the Gestapo in December 1936, Hirsch confessed to planning to murder Julius Streicher, a leading Nazi official and editor of the virulently anti-Semitic Der St√ºrmer newspaper, on behalf of Strasser and the Black Front. Hirsch was sentenced to death on March 8, 1937, and on June 4 was beheaded with an axe. Perhaps the most significant Jewish resistance group within Germany for which records survive was the Berlin-based Baum Group (Baum-Gruppe), which was active from 1937 to 1942. Largely young Jewish women and men, the group disseminated anti-Nazi leaflets, and organized semi-public demonstrations. Its most notable action was the bombing of an anti-Soviet exhibit organized by Joseph Goebbels in Berlin's Lustgarten. The action resulted in mass arrests, executions, and reprisals against German Jews. Because of the reprisals it provoked, the bombing led to debate within opposition circles similar to those that took place elsewhere where the Jewish resistance was active‚Äîtaking action and risking murderous reprisals vs. being non-confrontational with the hopes of maximizing survival.See, e.g., Herbert Lindenberger. Heroic Or Foolish? The 1942 Bombing of a Nazi Anti-Soviet Exhibit. Telos. 135 (Summer 2006):127‚Äì154. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands, the only pre-war group that immediately started resistance against the German occupation was the communist party. During the first two war years, it was by far the biggest resistance organization, much bigger than all other organizations put together. A major act of resistance was the organisation of the February strike in 1941, in protest against anti-Jewish measures. In this resistance, many Jews participated. About 1,000 Dutch Jews took part in resisting the Germans, and of those, 500 perished in doing so. In 1988, a monument to their memory was unveiled by the then mayor of Amsterdam, Ed van Thijn. Among the first Jewish resisters was the German fugitive Ernst Cahn, owner of an ice cream parlor. Together with his partner, Kohn, he had an ammonia gas cylinder installed in the parlor to stave off attacks from the militant arm of the fascist NSB, the so-called \\"Weerafdeling\\"(\\"WA\\"). One day in February 1941 the German police forced their entrance into the parlor, and were gassed. Later, Cahn was caught and on March 3, 1941 he became the first civilian to be executed by a Nazi firing squad in the Netherlands. Benny Bluhm, a boxer, organized Jewish fighting parties consisting of members of his boxing school to resist attacks. One of these brawls led to the death of a WA- member, H. Koot, and subsequently the Germans ordered the first Dutch razzia (police raid) of Jews as a reprisal. That in turn led to the Februaristaking, the February Strike. Bluhm's group was the only Jewish group resisting the Germans in the Netherlands and the first active group of resistance fighters in the Netherlands. Bluhm survived the war, and strove for a monument for the Jewish resisters that came about two years after his death in 1986. Numerous Jews participated in resisting the Germans. The Jewish director of the assembly center in the \\"Hollandsche Schouwburg\\", a former theatre, Walter S√ºskind, was instrumental in smuggling children out of his centre. He was aided by his assistant Jacques van de Kar and the director of the nearby cr√®che, Mrs Pimentel.Dr. L. de Jong, Het Koninkrijk, Amsterdam, RIOD/Staatsuitgeverij 1975 Within the underground communist party, a militant group was formed: de Nederlandse Volksmilitie (NVM, Dutch Peoples Militia). The leader was Sally (Samuel) Dormits, who had military experience from guerrilla warfare in Brazil and participation in the Spanish Civil War. This organisation was formed in The Hague but became mainly located in Rotterdam. It counted about 200 mainly Jewish participants. They made several bomb attacks on German troop trains and arson attacks on cinemas, which were forbidden for Jews. Dormits was caught after stealing a handbag off a woman in order to obtain an identification card for his Jewish girlfriend, who also participated in the resistance. Dormits committed suicide in the police station by shooting himself through the head. From a cash ticket of a shop the police found the hiding place of Dormits and discovered bombs, arson material, illegal papers, reports about resistance actions and a list of participants. The Gestapo was warned immediately and that day two hundred people were arrested, followed by many more connected people in Rotterdam, The Hague and Amsterdam. The Dutch police participated in torturing the Jewish communists. After a trial more than 20 were shot to death; most of the others died in concentration camps or were gassed in Auschwitz. Only a few survived. Jewish resistance in Allied militaries Soldiers of the British Jewish Brigade on parade in October 1944 The British Army trained 37 Jewish volunteers from Mandate Palestine to parachute into Europe in an attempt to organize resistance. The most famous member of this group was Hannah Szenes. She was parachuted into Yugoslavia to assist in the rescue of Hungarian Jews about to be deported to the German death camp at Auschwitz.Hecht, Ben. Perfidy, first published by Julian Messner, 1961; this edition Milah Press, 1997, pp. 118-133. Hecht cites Bar Adon, Dorothy and Pessach. The Seven who Fell. Sefer Press, 1947, and \\"The Return of Hanna Senesh\\" in Pioneer Woman, XXV, No. 5, May 1950. Szenes was arrested at the Hungarian border, then imprisoned and tortured, but refused to reveal details of her mission. She was eventually tried and executed by firing squad. She is regarded as a national heroine in Israel. The British government formed in July 1944 the Jewish Brigade, which comprised more than 5,000 Jewish volunteers from Palestine, organized into three infantry regiments, an artillery regiment, and supporting units. They were attached to the British Eighth Army in Italy from November 1944, taking part to the spring 1945 \\"final offensive\\" on that front. After the end of the war in Europe the Brigade was moved to Belgium and the Netherlands in July 1945. As well as participating in combat operations against German forces, the brigade assisted and protected Holocaust survivors.Beckman, Morris: The Jewish Brigade The Special Interrogation Group was a British Army commando unit comprising German-speaking Jewish volunteers from Palestine. It carried out commando and sabotage raids behind Axis lines during the Western Desert Campaign, and gathered military intelligence by stopping and questioning German transports while dressed as German military police. They also assisted other British forces. Following the disastrous failure of Operation Agreement, a series of ground and amphibious operations carried out by British, Rhodesian and New Zealand forces on German and Italian-held Tobruk in September 1942, the survivors were transferred to the Royal Pioneer Corps.

Calling themselves Nokmim (Hebrew for \\"avengers\\"), they tracked down and executed former Nazis who took part in the Holocaust. They killed an unknown number of Nazis, and their efforts are believed to have continued into the 1950s. The Nazis were often kidnapped and killed by hanging or strangulation, others were killed by hit-and-run attacks, and a former high-ranking Gestapo officer died when kerosene was injected into his bloodstream while he was in hospital awaiting an operation. It is possible that some of the most successful Nokmim were veterans of the Jewish Brigade, who had access to military intelligence, transport, and the right to freely travel across Europe. Nokmim also travelled to places such as Latin America, Canada, and Spain to track down and kill Nazis who had settled there. In one instance, they are believed to have confronted Aleksander Laak, responsible for killing 8,500 Jews at J√§gala concentration camp, at his suburban Winnipeg home, and after telling him that they intended to kill him, allowed him to commit suicide. In 1946, the Nokmim carried out a mass poisoning attack against former SS members imprisoned at Stalag 13, lacing their bread rations with arsenic at the bakery which supplied it. Approximately 1,200 prisoners fell ill, but no deaths were reported. The U.S. Army mustered its medical resources to treat the poisoned prisoners. Nokmin responses ranged from viewing this mass assassination attempt as a failure to claiming that the Allies covered up the fact that there had been deaths.

It was first published in Weirdbook magazine in 1984 and collected in King's 1985 collection called Skeleton Crew. Certain characters/creatures/unearthly powers featured in the works of H. P. Lovecraft also appear in this story, making it a story set in the Cthulhu Mythos. Plot summary An 11-year-old boy named George Bruckner is at home with his mother, Ruth, when the two find out that George's 13-year-old brother Buddy has broken his leg playing baseball. George's mother must go into the city, an hour away, to visit Buddy in the hospital, but someone must stay home to watch her own mother, a huge, cantankerous, ancient, bedridden woman. George reluctantly volunteers. As George sets about the kitchen after his mother leaves, he begins to think about his \\"Gramma\\" and recalls the first time she came to the house. He had been six years old, and the old woman demanded that he come to her that she could \\"give him a hug\\". George was terrified by the idea and cried endlessly. His mother eventually pacified Gramma, promising that he would hug her \\"in time\\". George waits for his mother to return. As the hours pass, strange thoughts‚Äîevents he had witnessed earlier‚Äîbegin to surface in his mind. He recalls overhearing his mother's siblings begging her to care for the old woman: \\"You're the only one who can quiet her down, Ruth.\\" Eventually, Ruth was forced to leave San Francisco and move to Castle Rock, Maine to care for their mother. George also recalls that Gramma had been kicked out of her church, as well as dismissed from her position as a schoolteacher, for owning particular books. He finally remembers that the woman had been infertile for a long while, any pregnancies she did achieve ending in miscarriages or stillbirths and it was only after being excommunicated that she became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy child. George suddenly hears a scraping sound on sheets; he imagines Gramma's long, ragged fingernails rubbing against her bed. He enters to check on her and watches the obese, white, almost formless woman for a few moments. Quite suddenly, he recalls other memories: his Gramma uttering strange words one night, and relatives dying the next morning. George abruptly realizes that his grandmother is a witch, having gained dark powers from reading the forbidden tomes. As George makes this realization, he realizes that his Gramma has died. Though terrified, he holds a mirror before her nose, making sure. Once he is convinced, he prepares to make a phone call to the doctor, only to find that the phone is dead. George opts to wait for his mother to come home, and thinks of the praise he will gain for handling the situation so calmly, until he realizes that he did not cover his grandmother's face. He imagines his brother tormenting him endlessly for this \\"cowardly\\" lack of action. Determined, George enters the dead woman's room and places a sheet over her flabby face. As he does, her hand suddenly wraps around his wrist and holds it for a few moments. George flees the room, injuring his nose in the process. As he tries to rationalize the movement, he hears groaning from the next room, as though the corpse was trying to get off of the bed. He then hears his Gramma calling him: \\"Come here, Georgie... Gramma wants to give you a hug.\\" George is terrified and races from the room. He hears the enormous woman stumbling after him, and even guesses that as a witch, she waited until she was alone with him to die. His Aunt Flo calls, and he tries to explain the situation as Gramma enters the kitchen. Aunt Flo tells him that he must invoke the name of Hastur and tell Gramma to \\"lie down\\" in his name. Gramma knocks the phone from his hand, and George screams the phrase repeatedly: \\"You have to lie down! In Hastur's name! Lie down!\\" Gramma wraps her arms around him. The story jumps to an hour later, with George sitting calmly at the kitchen table. When Ruth returns, George runs to her, explaining that Gramma died. His mother fearfully asks if \\"anything else happened.\\" George denies it and goes off to his room to sleep. It is implied that Gramma has possessed George, turning the boy into an evil warlock, as he used a spell to strike down his Aunt Flo with an aneurysm. The story ends with George grinning wickedly, imagining the kind of torture he will be able to inflict on his brother. It is not clarified if George has been possessed by the dead woman's spirit or has absorbed her evil powers to use as his own. Film, TV, and theatrical adaptations The story was made into an episode of The Twilight Zone in 1986; the screenplay was written by Harlan Ellison. Some of the voice over for \\"Gramma\\" was done by Piper Laurie, who had previously starred in the first film adaptation of King's novel Carrie. In 2014, the story was adapted into a feature film titled Mercy.http://www.slashfilm.com/stephen-king-adaptation-mercy-headed-to-big- screen-with-paranormal-activity-producer-jason-blumhouse/ Chandler Riggs portrayed George in the film.

History In 1996, construction began on a $110 million, 888-bed addition which included 600 maximum security cells in six units. The new addition houses the Security Housing Unit (SHU) and the Medium-High Housing Unit (MHU). Inmates in the SHU, which formerly included the prison's death row, occupy single-bunked cells in which they are locked down and receive three hours a week out of their cell for recreational purposes. Inmates may earn their way out of the SHU through good behavior. In 2015, the prison became a subject of an ACLU lawsuit, due to the use of solitary confinement for mentally ill inmates. Further lawsuits have been filed due to the Delaware State Correction's decision to feed some inmates \\"baked slop,\\" while other states have discontinued the use of such meals. Incidents On July 12, 2004, 45-year-old inmate Scott Miller, armed with a shank, took a 27-year-old female prison counselor hostage. Miller raped the woman who he held for seven hours before being shot and killed. Miller, a convicted serial rapist, was serving a 694-year sentence at the time. On February 1, 2017, inmates took control of Building C, initially holding five correctional officers as hostages according to media reports. This building houses about 100 inmates. The incident was first reported by a correctional officer's radio call for \\"immediate assistance\\" at 10:38 a.m. The prison, and all other prisons within Delaware, were placed on lockdown. One hostage was released a few hours later, and taken to a hospital with 'non-life threatening' injuries. Later that evening, two other hostages were reportedly released. When the hostage situation ended, one hostage, identified as correctional officer and 16-year veteran Sgt. Steven Floyd, was killed and another was injured. The incident led to a proposal to reinstate the death penalty in Delaware.

New Plymouth Airport serves the city of New Plymouth, and the surrounding region of Taranaki. It is on the west coast of New Zealand's North Island and is 11 km from the city centre, on the highway north to Auckland, and 4 km from the outer suburb/satellite town of Bell Block. New Plymouth Airport consists of two domestic terminal buildings. The main airport terminal building is currently 1430 square metres, and Terminal 2 is 420 square metres. It is currently undergoing a $28.7 million terminal upgrade which is expected to be complete by 2019 which will increase the terminal floor size by more than double its current size and include new features like security screening and mechanical baggage claims. New Plymouth Airport is served with daily air services by Air New Zealand, Originair, and Jetstar Airways. Air New Zealand offers daily direct flights to Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch operated on behalf of the national airline carrier by Mount Cook Airline and Air Nelson. Jetstar Airways commenced daily services between New Plymouth and Auckland on 1 February 2016. From 29 September 2017, Originair began direct flights between New Plymouth and Nelson, New Zealand. On 30 September 2018, Originair launched direct flights between New Plymouth and Napier, New Zealand. The airline provides daily flights between the two cities. The company's British Aerospace 18-seat Jetstream aircraft fly the route and the company is adding another Jetstream to its operations to cover contracted charter flights, tours and maintenance coverage. Jetstar Airways had originally planned to conduct 27 weekly return flights between New Plymouth and Auckland however only 20 return flights weekly had been offered. The Jetstar flights are operated by Qantas Link's Eastern Australia Airlines. In terms of passenger numbers, it was the 9th busiest in New Zealand in 2016, with 411,661 people flying to the airport, a 20.3 percent increase on 2015 statistics. Jetstar's new regional services to New Plymouth was responsible for the large jump, according to airport management. Hence, more people fly to New Plymouth than other cities with larger populations such as Hamilton and Tauranga. In October 2009, New Plymouth Airport was voted as the best regional airport in New Zealand. History The original airport opened in 1933 with the New Plymouth Airport Act. It had five runways, the longest of which was around . During World War II, the airport became RNZAF Bell Block Airbase. Les Munro, one of the pilots in the Dambusters Raid, soloed here on the Tiger Moth. Post war, the airport returned to civilian use, and was used by New Zealand National Airways Corporation with links to Whenuapai (Auckland) and Paraparaumu (Wellington). In line with a general improvement throughout the 1950s and 1960s, of New Zealand's infrastructure, and National Airways Corporation (NZNAC) acquisition of Fokker F27 Friendships, New Plymouth's airport was reviewed. In view of the undulating land, the need for a tarmac runway for the F27, and the clearer approach paths required, a new airfield was soon under construction at the end of Brown Road (recently renamed Airport Drive). During construction of the airport, a small hill at the west end of the runway had to be levelled off, due to take-off and landing path infringements. This was rather controversial, due to said hill being a MƒÅori burial ground. The government of the day decided to go ahead with construction anyway, and despite protests, the hill was levelled. Part of it still remains. The airport opened in 1966, replacing a grass airfield 3 km southwest, which is now industrial land. The foundation stone from the original airport, and a stone commemorating RNZAF Bell Block, were moved to the new airport when it opened. The original terminal was renovated during the 1990s. The observation deck upstairs was removed at this time, and the outside observation area was removed in 2005, due to rising security concerns worldwide. Facilities New Plymouth Airport has two domestic terminal buildings. The main terminal building is equipped with a cafe, a Koru Regional Lounge and Air New Zealand check-in counters. The second terminal building known as Terminal 2 is occupied by low-cost airline Jetstar Airways and Nelson based Originair. In August 2015 when Jetstar announced they would commence services to New Plymouth in December 2015, the plans were delayed until 1 February 2016 to allow for a $1 million terminal building to be created at New Plymouth Airport dedicated to Jetstar's regional services. The main terminal building was too small for two commercial airline carriers and therefore a second building was required. Additional aircraft gates were also added. Terminal 2 is equipped with two Jetstar check-in counters, two Originair check-in counters and a baggage claim area. The two terminal buildings have 8 aircraft gates combined, of which Terminal 2 exclusively uses Gate 8. Jetstar and Originair is expected to relocate into the main terminal building once upgrades to the airport are completed. New Plymouth Airport has a control tower with services provided by Airways Corporation. It is staffed from 6am to around 8 pm on weekdays, and reduced hours on weekends, to coincide with airline traffic movements. There is also one fire rescue unit and another small emergency unit based at New Plymouth Airport. The airport's only sealed taxiway connects the apron and the asphalt runway, so aircraft taxi on the runway, and commence take off roll from runway ends. New Plymouth Airport is infamous for crosswinds, due mostly to the fact that although the tarmac runway faces into the prevailing SSW wind the area regularly receives a strong SSE/SE. The cross runway is not sealed, and thus airline traffic is limited to the tarmac runway, parallel to the sea. The tarmac runway is equipped with low intensity runway lighting, runway end lighting, and Precision Approach Path Indicators. The sealed taxiway and apron are also lit. The airport has VOR/DME equipment. It was equipped with an NDB, but this was recently removed. New Plymouth Aero Club and its Air New Plymouth charter service was based at the airport, until it ceased operations in 2014. Previously it carried out charter work and air ambulance services as well as providing a well recognised flight training facility. General aviation aircraft are located at the airport as well as heritage De Havilland Vampire, an L-39 Albatross, four Yak 52s and a Catalina Flying Boat. Airport terminal upgrades A proposal for a $29 million airport terminal upgrade at New Plymouth Airport has been given its final approval by the New Plymouth District Council. The airport's terminal building opened in 1967 and was designed to handle just 60,000 passengers per year. In 2016, 411,661 people flew in and out of New Plymouth making it the 9th busiest airport in the country. In an uncommon move, councillors approved the most expensive option for the redevelopment which included cultural aspects in the design and rejected plans for a cheaper, more functional building without any arguing. The new master plan proposes a major expansion of the terminal so it will have a floor area of 4092 square metres instead of the current 1430 square metres. The terminal design features separate arrival and departure gates, installing a larger mechanical baggage claim, a larger Air New Zealand lounge, more space for retail and the cafe, and the ability to create a passenger security area if required in the future. The master plan also proposes a two-stage runway extension to better cater for larger ATR aircraft which are now regularly using the airport. The current runway length limits their operation under certain conditions so the proposal is for an initial extension to 1500m and then potentially to 1700m.

Background The Grenville family interest, led by Richard Grenville-Temple, 2nd Earl Temple, which dominated local politics in Buckinghamshire, was prominent in the mid-18th century politics as close allies of Temple's brother-in-law, William Pitt the Elder. However, in the early 1760s, a split occurred in the family as a result of Pitt's dismissal from the government in October 1761. Temple quit the government in protest, his younger brother, but George Grenville, remained in the government, which was now dominated by King George III favourite, Lord Bute, who served as Leader of the House of Commons. The followers of the younger Grenville became known as Grenvillites, or Grenville Whigs. George Grenville George Grenville fully came into his own as a politician in 1763, when he was made Prime Minister, but his own following was not sufficient to form a government. Grenville was forced to rely largely on the Bedford Whigs, supporters of the Duke of Bedford, to staff his ministry. After Grenville himself was ousted from power in 1765 as a result of conflicts with the King, Grenville moved into opposition and for a time from 1766 to 1767 was the leader of one of three separate opposition factions (the other two were led by the Duke of Bedford and Lord Rockingham). After Grenville's own death in 1770, the Earl of Suffolk took over the official leadership of Grenville's faction and negotiated Grenvillite entrance into the Lord North ministry in early 1771, but many of Grenville's former supporters refused to follow him and remained in opposition with Chatham and Temple. William Pitt After Lord Temple's death in 1779, George Grenville's sons, George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 3rd Earl Temple (from 1784 the Marquess of Buckingham), and William Wyndham Grenville, became the principal figures in the Grenville family. Temple played a key role in bringing down the Fox-North coalition in December 1783 and in bringing his cousin William Pitt the Younger to power as Prime Minister, but he was snubbed for major office. Nevertheless, he and his supporters backed the new ministry, and William Grenville soon became one of Pitt's closest advisors and served for ten years (1791‚Äì1801) as Foreign Secretary during the difficult period of the French Revolutionary Wars. Lord Grenville The resignation of Pitt's government in 1801 brought about a separation between Pitt and his cousin, now Lord Grenville, which was encouraged by Buckingham and his followers, who had always resented Pitt for preventing him from receiving major office. During the Addington government from 1801 to 1804, a number of former supporters of the Pitt government declared their dissatisfaction with the new ministry, came to consider Grenville as their leader and called calling themselves \\"Grenvilles\\" or \\"Grenvillite\\". Although Grenville himself initially kept his distance from his supposed followers, he had by 1803 acknowledged himself as their leader. Other than dependents of Lord Buckingham, the group was largely former Portland Whigs who had joined the Pitt government in 1794 and opposed the Addington government's policy of peace with France. Notable members of the group included Lord Spencer, Lord Fitzwilliam, William Windham and Buckingham and Grenville's brother Thomas Grenville. The group, which was also known as the \\"New Opposition\\", gradually made a tentative alliance with Charles James Fox's \\"Old Opposition\\" although they disagreed wholly on the issue of war with France. The Grenvillites wished to prosecute it more aggressively, but Fox desired peace by negotiation. When Addington's government fell in 1804, Grenville hoped to form a coalition government that included supporters of Pitt, Fox and himself but was stymied by the King's refusal to countenance a government that included Fox. Thus, Grenville, unwilling to go into government without his new ally, Fox, remained in opposition when Pitt formed his second government in May of that year. When Pitt died two years later, however, the King had little choice but to appoint a government including both \\"New\\" and the \\"Old\\" Opposition, and Grenville was became Prime Minister in the Ministry of All the Talents. Although the coalition partners agreed about little besides the abolition of the slave trade, it was really the King's opposition to the ministry that destroyed it in early 1807. Thereafter, Grenville acted as nominal Leader of the Opposition although Lord Grey, the leader of the Foxites, was essentially equal with him. Withdrawal from politics After Buckingham's death in 1813 and Grenville's withdrawal from politics in 1817, the Grenvillites remained a distinct political grouping in opposition, but they were by now little more than a pawn of the ambitions of Buckingham's son, the 2nd Marquess of Buckingham. The former Portland Whigs who remained active in politics had by now largely returned to their former Whig allegiances. In 1822, Prime Minister Lord Liverpool bought the group's support for the government by creating Buckingham as Duke of Buckingham and Chandos and bringing in several of his supporters, notably Charles Williams-Wynn, who became President of the Board of Control, into the government. In the years that followed, the Grenvillites disappeared as a distinct political faction.

Starting his career at Blackpool as an apprentice, Greenall had spells at Gillingham, Oxford United, Bury, Preston North End, Chester City and Lincoln City before finishing his career at his hometown club, Wigan Athletic. Playing career =Blackpool= At Blackpool, Greenall made his professional debut on 23 September 1980, at the age of 16 years and 237 days, becoming the club's then-youngest-ever league player (a record broken by Trevor Sinclair in 1989). Three days later, he appeared in a League Cup game against Everton at Goodison Park. Greenall was one of a host of young players brought to Blackpool by Alan Ball during his short managerial reign at the club. Unlike most of the others, however, he remained at the club for years and developed into a dependable defender. He eventually took over the central role, combining with captain Steve Hetzke and Mike Conroy to form a successful defensive partnership. Greenall won England Youth honours and, at 20, was voted the Fourth Division's Player of the Year by the PFA. =Gillingham= After 183 league appearances in just over five years, Greenall had a contractual dispute with Blackpool, and in September 1986 he moved to Third Division Gillingham for ¬£40,000. =Oxford United= Greenall joined Oxford United in February 1988 for ¬£235,000, and the U's soon made him skipper following the departure of Tommy Caton, as he enjoyed a brief taste of top-flight football before they were relegated at the end of the season. =Bury and Preston North End= In July 1990, he moved to Bury for ¬£100,000 after an initial loan spell at Gigg Lane, before departing for Preston North End during 1991‚Äì92 ‚Äì a move in his favour as Preston narrowly beat the drop from Division Three while Bury were relegated. Preston would follow suit 12 months later, however. =Latter years= After a year at Chester City, where he won promotion and player of the season in 1993‚Äì94, and a spell with Lincoln City, Greenall joined Wigan Athletic in 1995. At Wigan, he helped guide the team to Third Division success as an ever-present captain in 1997. After coming out of retirement, Greenall made his Wembley debut in 1999 when he defied his advancing years to help Wigan beat Millwall 1‚Äì0 to win the Football League Trophy. Coaching career In 2001, Greenall became caretaker-manager of Wigan for six games, losing only once, but he did not get the job permanently and was to lose his coaching job at Wigan shortly afterwards. He returned to playing with Rossendale United while searching for new coaching opportunities. In June 2002 he was appointed Head of Youth Development at Rochdale and in June 2004 Director of the Centre of Excellence at Rochdale. In August 2005 he was appointed to the role of Coach Education Manager at the Lancashire FA.

His escape from Auschwitz in 1942 and early eyewitness testimony inspired Belgium's opposition to Nazi Germany during World War II, and alerted the Resistance to the atrocities that were taking place in the concentration camps. Because of Herskovic's escape and testimony, hundreds of lives were saved. Herskovic is also the founder of Bel Air Camera, a veritable landmark in Los Angeles, which he established in 1957, and has received numerable awards for his philanthropy. Early life Herskovic was born in June 1914 in what was then Hungary. His mother died when he was only 6 months old, and his father had many children by a second wife, so he was raised mainly by his maternal grandparents. Herskovic, who spoke 9 languages, dropped out of school at the age of 13 in order to take his brother's place as a photographer's apprentice. By the age of 15 he was running photo studios across Czechoslovakia and winning awards as an artist for his skill in photographic retouching. By the age of 17, he had started his own photo studio, Studio Willy, that quickly gained fame across Belgium. He married his first wife, Esther, and they had two girls‚ÄîGiselle (Katie) Herskovic, born in 1938, and Germaine Herskovic, born in 1941. Holocaust experiences Herskovic's businesses were confiscated by the Germans and he, his wife and their two baby girls were sent to a concentration camp. All though he wouldn't find out until a long time later, his wife and two daughters were killed in a gas chamber almost immediately upon their arrival. Herskovic was sent to an Auschwitz hard labor camp where he wasn't expected to live long on about 130 calories a day. Herskovic set about planning an escape, and on the first night of Hanukkah, 1942, Herskovic and two others dug a pair of wire cutters out from beneath layers of snow where they had hidden them, and cut through chain-link fences during a blizzard. The three ran through the snow for hours towards freedom. Herskovic then warned the Belgian underground of what was going on in the camps. \\"Do not go peacefully, they are killing us by the hundreds,\\" he is quoted as saying in Escape to Life: A Journey Through the Holocaust, his biography. Herskovic's forged \\"Peter Dobos\\" identity papers The resistance quickly mobilized, stopping a transport train and rescuing hundreds bound for the camps. \\"His survival saved hundreds,\\" according to a Simon Wiesenthal Center tribute. Herskovic then went undercover, carefully crafting false papers and getting a job camouflaging the beaches of Normandy, where he was in fact observing military installations and drawing sketches to send back to the resistance. After the war Herskovic, discovering that his wife and children had been killed, asked his first wife's younger sister, Maria, for her hand in marriage (her husband had also been killed in the Holocaust). She accepted. They had three children, all girls, and moved to America. In Los Angeles, Herskovic founded Bel Air Camera in 1957 in Westwood Village, which is still a family-owned business to this day. From the moment he immigrated to the U.S. with his wife, Mireille, they began their heartfelt dedication to philanthropy, contributing to communities whenever possible. With an understandable commitment to his history, he was a founding supporter of the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. where a plaque proudly commemorates, and hopefully puts to rest, all the beloved family he lost who were never given the benefit of gravestones. He was also dedicated to the Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance in hopes, \\"that education and awareness will prevent prejudice and hatred in the future.\\" Additionally, he and his wife have been loyal supporters of numerous organizations including: UJF, ADL, Friends of Sheba Medical Center, Friends of Israel Disabled Veterans, Technion, UCLA's Hillel, Milken Community High School, Stephen S. Wise Temple, The Jesters (a charity helping blind children), Israel Cancer Research Fund, and others. Awards Throughout his life, Herskovic received numerous awards for his heroic and philanthropic work. Most recently, he was given the Humanitarian Award by the Israel Cancer Research Fund. Death William Herskovic died on March 3, 2006 at his home in Encino, CA after a long battle with prostate cancer. He was 91. Herskovic is survived by his wife, Maria, their three children, four grandchildren and great-grandchild.

The new settlement (part of a chain of Spanish missions) was named for a 15th-century theologian and warrior priest who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy. The mission San Juan was named after Saint John of Capestrano. Mission The first primitive capilla (chapel) was built out of brush and mud. Eventually a campanile, or \\"bell tower\\" containing two bells was incorporated into the structure, which was replaced by a long granary with a flat roof and an attractive belfry around 1756. Around 1760, construction of a larger church building begun on the east side of the Mission compound, but was never completed due to the lack of sufficient labor. Mission San Juan did not prosper to the same extent as the other San Antonio missions because lands allotted to it were not sufficient to plant vast quantities of crops, or breed large numbers of horses and cattle; a dam was constructed in order to supply water to the Mission's acequia, or irrigation system. (the Mission reportedly owned 1,000 head of cattle, 3,500 sheep and goats, and 100 horses in 1762). Some 265 neophytes resided in adobe huts at the Mission in 1756; by 1790 the native Coahuiltecan people were living in stone quarters, though their number had dropped to 58. The Mission often encountered systemic issues concerning corralling the native's nomadic tendencies, which consequently led to large amounts of the converted Indians to sporadically leave. San Juan Capistrano was administered by the College of Santa Cruz de Quer√©taro until March 1773, when it was placed under the care of the College of Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe de Zacatecas.  Secularization  The mission was secularized on July 14, 1794, after which time it was attended by the resident priest at Mission San Francisco de la Espada, until about 1813; it was then attended by the one remaining missionary at the nearby Mission San Jos√© y San Miguel de Aguayo until 1824. The native population of the Mission were either disbanded, temporarily moved to other missions, or Hispanicized. Mission San Juan was largely neglected until 1840, when religious services were once again conducted, this time by diocesan priests. A neighborhood around the Mission, partially inhabited by the descendants of the Missions population, steadily grew in part due to the construction of a railroad nearby in 1855. Members of the Claretian and Redemptorist Orders also held mass in the church until 1967, when the Franciscans returned to Mission San Juan.  Theft of Three Altar Statues  Three Spanish Colonial-period statues that sat at the altar were stolen sometime on the night of Monday, July 31 or early the morning of Tuesday, August 1, 2000. The statues are between 3‚Äì4 feet tall and are constructed of carved wood that had been painted. They are considered priceless due to their religious and historical significance. San Antonio Missions National Historical Park As part of a public works project in 1934 some of the native quarters and the foundations of the unfinished church were unearthed. The church, priests' quarters, and other structures were reconstructed during the 1960s. Most of the original square remains within the courtyard walls, portraying an authentic depiction of the floor plan and layout. The grounds of Mission San Juan Capistrano has been maintained by the National Park Service as a part of the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park since the 1980s, and the Archdiocese of San Antonio maintains the church building, parish parking lot, rectory (priest's quarters), and the parish hall (Slattery Hall). The hall is located across Villamain Road from the mission but is still inside the park boundary. 2012 Renovation A $2.2 million renovation in 2012 stabilized the foundation of the mission's church. The shifting clay soil beneath the building had caused severe cracks and falling plaster. A pier-and-beam foundation was added that extends around the perimeter and as far as 29 feet deep into the ground. This allowed buttresses placed against walls in the mid-20th century to be removed. Eggshell white color lime plaster now covers the exterior in contrast to its longstanding dark, weathered look.

Production background Starring Robert Alda as Gershwin, the film features a few of Gershwin's acquaintances (including Paul Whiteman, Al Jolson, and Oscar Levant) playing themselves. Alexis Smith and Joan Leslie play fictional women in Gershwin's life, Morris Carnovsky and Rosemary De Camp play Gershwin's parents, and Herbert Rudley portrays Ira Gershwin. Oscar Levant also recorded most of the piano playing in the movie, and also dubbed Alda's piano playing. Both the Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris are performed nearly completely, the \\"Rhapsody...\\" debut of 1924 conducted, as it was originally, by Whiteman himself. The film introduces two fictional romances into the story, one with a woman named Julie Adams (played by Joan Leslie) and the other a near-romance with a rich society woman played by Alexis Smith. The film notably features performances of Gershwin music by two talented and accomplished African-American musician/singers, Anne Brown (1916‚Äì2009) and Hazel Scott (1920‚Äì1981). Both were child prodigies whose training included study at the Juilliard School. Anne Brown, a soprano, created the role of \\"Bess\\" in the original production of George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess in 1935. In the film, Brown sings the aria Summertime from Porgy and Bess. But in the film, the song is completely rearranged, with the first verse sung by chorus only. William Gillespie, an African-American bass-baritone, appeared uncredited as \\"Porgy\\" in the 'Porgy and Bess' sequence, but did not sing. Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Hazel Scott was raised in New York City and became known as a jazz and classical pianist and singer. Like Lena Horne, Scott was one of the first African-American women to have a career in Hollywood as well as television. Scott plays herself in the film, performing in a Paris nightclub. Cast Production Irving Rapper felt it was \\"a rambling story, a little too sentimental at times, although written by some wonderful people, mainly Clifford Odets with far, far too much music.\\" Rapper wanted Tyrone Power to play the lead but had to use Robert Alda. The director says apart from Alda's casting he was happy with the film. Reception Contemporary reviews praised the music but had more mixed opinions about the plot. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called the film a \\"standard biography,\\" explaining: \\"There is never any true clarification of what makes the gentleman run, no interior grasp of his nature, no dramatic continuity to his life. The whole thing unfolds in fleeting episodes, with characters viewing the genius with anxiety or awe, and the progression is not helped by many obvious and telescoping cuts. Throughout, the brilliant music of Mr. Gershwin is spotted abundantly, and that is the best‚Äîin fact, the only‚Äîintrinsically right thing in the film.\\" Variety reported that the film \\"can't miss\\" with \\"such an embarrassment of musical riches,\\" to the point that \\"corny lapses\\" in the script \\"can easily be glossed over.\\" Harrison's Reports wrote that the musical score was \\"in itself worth the price of admission,\\" while the film also offered \\"an inspiring, heart-warming story.\\" Wolcott Gibbs of The New Yorker called the music \\"magnificent\\", but criticized the plot as a \\"monumental collection of nonsense,\\" describing the romance as \\"silly and tiresome.\\" =Box office= According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $3,342,000 domestically and $1,514,000 foreign. Awards and nominations The film was nominated for the Grand Prize at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also nominated for two Academy Awards; Music (Scoring of a Musical Picture, lost to Anchors Aweigh) and Best Sound (Nathan Levinson).

Background  Love and Rockets dismissed Earth, Sun, Moon's folk sound in favour of a stronger rock sound. Hints of the band's former psychedelic and gothic rock sound remains. Chief songwriters Daniel Ash and David J had begun concentrating strictly on their own material (rather than writing together) on Earth, Sun, Moon. The album featured Love and Rockets' biggest hit, the Ash-penned \\"So Alive\\". The song was a surprising number 3 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, and stayed at number 1 for five weeks on the US Modern Rock chart. Because of the popularity of the single in the US, Love and Rockets became the band's best-selling album in America. It did very well in Canada as well, being certified platinum there in 1989, largely on the strength of \\"So Alive\\" which was a #1 single. After the release of the album, the band embarked on a long worldwide tour. Afterward, instead of recording a new album and a follow-up single to \\"So Alive\\", J and Ash both focused on their solo careers, continuing in the directions represented on this album. They each released two solo albums after the break (with drummer Kevin Haskins working primarily with Ash) before returning as a band to record Hot Trip to Heaven in 1994. In 2002, the album was remastered and expanded into a double album. The bonus tracks featured a single remix, three b-sides, all five songs from the aborted Swing! EP, and a radio session. The Swing! project was to be an outlet for some of the band's eccentric output, but the material was never released, except for \\"Bad Monkey\\", which ended up on the Glittering Darkness EP in 1996. \\"The Purest Blue\\" is a radical reworking of \\"Waiting for the Flood\\" from Earth, Sun, Moon, and \\"**** (Jungle Law)\\" was later reworked as \\"Bad Monkey\\", recorded as part of the Swing! project.

The performers sit down in a row on the ground, crosslegged, usually the right leg over the left. If possible men and women alternate. To the left and/or right is/are the nafa (see below), behind them stand the langitua, the singers. On informal occasions the dancemaster may walk around, clapping his hands to keep up the rhythm and to encourage the performers. On formal occasions, like a presentation to the king, the dancemaster also stands in the back. Only when the dancemaster is the chief Malukava, he is allowed per tradition to be in front. If there are many dancers, often the case when a school performs, up to 500 at a really huge occasion, they sit in staggered rows. The dancers of front row (which gets the most attention and therefore sits the best dancers or the ones with the highest social status) sit on the ground. The second row on a low bench, the next row on a higher bench, and so forth. The last row usually stands, or if that is still not enough, they may stand on benches and tables. If the dance is an effort of a local community, young and old perform. The youngest children then cutely sit at the ends of the rows. In the Uiha tradition the arrangement is different: the women sit on the ground in the frontrow(s) but the men stand behind them and act more as in a lakalaka. Like the otuhaka, the mƒÅuluulu consists usually of a sung and a silent part. It starts with the beating of the nafa, huge drums made from discarded 200 litre, iron, fuel drums, covered with a leather skin. The nafa-master can make a whole show of it, hitting the drums with his two decorated sticks almost performing a dance himself. Once he has calmed down and he, and his helpers have settled down in a continuous beating of the drums, the tafua starts. This is the silent part of the performance in which the dancers are performing all the typical haka (dance gestures) of the main dance, as whether they want to show them off before you would be distracted by the singing later. In semi-formal performances this is the moment that the public, which has become mƒÅfana (excited), can come forward to put fakapale on the dancers they fancy to be the best or close family. On really formal performances this is not allowed, on really informal performances, often fundraising, the fakapale goes on about for the whole dance, which unfortunately distracts a lot. When the tafua is over the nafa usually stops and singing starts. Like all other Tonga dances, the gestures do have some relationship with the words, but are largely symbolic. Like in the otuhaka the haka are supposed to be performed close the body, haka nounou (short armed) as opposed to the lakalaka. However the Vavau tradition allows much wilder and wider arm movements. The lyrics of the song is usually made for the occasion, praising the object into the skies. A silver jubilee of a school, a birthday of the king, and so on. The music is very limited. There are about 10 different tunes which can be used in a mƒÅuluulu, so that to the untrained ear they all sound much alike. Once the song is over another tafua follows. At this time the tempo of the dance has been increased feverishly, and so has the excitement of the public. A mƒÅuluulu takes around 15 minutes to complete. But it may have taken the performers 2 or 3 months to memorise the sequence of gestures. For a school there are daily sessions at the end of the class hours, for a community it will fill all their free nights, often combined with a faikava. References *A.L.

They have flattened heads, with small eyes that have round pupils, and keeled dorsal scales. Species like N. fasciata display distinct banding, whereas other species, like N. erythrogaster, have blotching, and those like N. rhombifer have diamond-shaped patterning. Most species are brown or olive green, or some combination thereof with markings being brown, or black. Yellow or cream-colored accenting is common.  Behavior  Water snakes, as their name implies, are largely aquatic. They spend the vast majority of their time in or very near permanent sources of water. Often, they can be found basking on tree branches that overhang slow- moving streams or ponds. Diet Their primary diet is fish and amphibians, and they are quite adept at catching both in their aquatic environment. They will also consume small reptiles and rodents that live near water. Defense While their initial instinct is to flee when disturbed, water snakes readily defend themselves if they are unable to escape. They do not often hesitate to strike or bite if handled, and often expel a foul-smelling musk from their cloacae.  Reproduction  Nerodia rhombifer, diamondback water snake, giving birth Nerodia species are viviparous, breeding in the spring and giving birth in the late summer or early fall. They are capable of having 90 or more young, but broods generally are much smaller. Neonates are around in length.

Their relative physical unattractiveness, compared to other available pet snake species, and their poor disposition make them less than attractive pets. They are easy to care for, though, and do quite well in captivity.  Conservation concerns  Some species, such as N. harteri and N. paucimaculata are only found in very isolated localities and are protected by state laws, but the majority of Nerodia species hold no specific conservation status. Due to their habitat choice, poor disposition, and vague similarity to the venomous cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), they are frequently mistaken for them. This results in many more water snakes being killed every year than cottonmouths. Often, water snakes found in areas where the cottonmouth does not range are still killed by humans out of ignorance and fear.

It runs north from U.S. Route 9 (US 9) at Poughkeepsie, starting out as Violet Avenue, then follows the Hudson River mostly along the eastern side of the US 9 to Rhinebeck, where the two routes cross just north of the village. From this point onward, NY 9G runs on the western side of US 9, closer to the Hudson River, to Hudson. It ends at another junction with US 9 in the city. NY 9G initially extended from Rhinebeck to Hudson when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was extended to its current length in the late 1930s, supplanting New York State Route 9F, an alternate route of US 9 between Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck. Route description NY 9G is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) outside of the cities of Poughkeepsie and Hudson. The portion of the route that enters the two cities is locally maintained. =Dutchess County= The highway starts at a junction with US 9 at Marist College and Saint Francis Hospital in the Dutchess County town of Poughkeepsie. It travels parallel to the Pulaski Park while heading south for a time. It turns sharply to the east for a time known as Parker Avenue. It passes north of College Hill Park and Morgan Lake prior to gradually turning north. Route 9G passes west of the Dutchess Community College, now known as Violet Avenue. Proceeding north, off to the east is the Fallkill County Park. An intersection with County Route 40 (CR 40) is not far off, while another intersection with CR 40A follows. Past CR 40A, it runs parallel to the Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site while it travels west of the Union Cemetery. NY 9G's southern terminus at US 9 in Poughkeepsie North of the site, NY 9G runs near a small stream for a time, while to the west is the Greentree Park. A turn to the northwest before turning due north again comes before an intersection with CR 37. The route enters DeWitt Mills, which brings an intersection with CR 14. On either side of the route are small lakes just as an intersection with CR 84 occurs. Continuing north, Burger Hill Park is to the west. From here, NY 9G meets NY 308 by way of an interchange as it enters the northern outskirts of Rhinebeck. The route crosses its parent, US 9, north of the village center, at which point it enters the Hudson River Historic District. Not far to the northwest is a junction with NY 199, which merges with NY 9G and follows it into the town of Red Hook. NY 9G and NY 199 split at a junction west of the village of Red Hook and east of the hamlet of Barrytown. NY 199 turns eastward toward the village while NY 9G heads north into Annandale-On-Hudson. Bard College is just to the west as NY 9G becomes limited access for a short time. An intersection with CR 79 follows, just prior entering Tivoli, where NY 9G meets CR 78. This junction was once the eastern terminus of NY 402. Not far to the north of Tivoli, NY 9G crosses into Columbia County and the town of Clermont. =Columbia County= Long dip to cross creek in Germantown. In Columbia County, NY 9G passes the Clermont State Historic Site and the Stone Jug in Clermont before proceeding north into the town of Germantown and the hamlet of the same name contained within. Outside of the hamlet, NY 9G turns to follow a more northeasterly course, matching a similar turn in the Hudson River. It crosses over Roeliff Jansen Kill on its way into the town of Greenport, where it meets NY 23 at the eastern foot of the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in a highly channelized junction adjacent to the Olana State Historic Site. NY 9G is concurrent with NY 23 for just less than before leaving with NY 23B to the northeast for the city of Hudson, passing through its historic downtown. The two routes overlap from the NY 23 east junction to the US 9 junction on the east side of the city, where the concurrency and NY 9G both end. NY 23B, meanwhile, continues east of here, following US 9 for several blocks to the east toward Claverack. History View of the Catskill Escarpment from 9G in northern Dutchess County NY 9G was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it extended only from US 9 in Rhinebeck to US 9 in Hudson. South of Annandale-on-Hudson, NY 9G was routed on River and Mount Rutsen Roads. The portion of NY 9G between Germantown and NY 199, under construction in 1930,Automobile Legal Association (ALA) Automobile Green Book, 1930‚Äì31 and 1931‚Äì32 editions, (Scarborough Motor Guide Co., Boston, 1930 and 1931). The 1930‚Äì31 edition shows New York state routes prior to the 1930 renumbering was opened to traffic from NY 199 to Tivoli by the following year and completed . Farther south, an alternate route of US 9 between Poughkeepsie and Hyde Park via East Park was designated NY 9F as part of the renumbering. NY 9F was extended northward from East Park to Rhinebeck, where it ended at a junction with US 9 northeast of the village. NY 9F was absorbed into a rerouted and extended NY 9G . The former routing of NY 9G from Annandale-on-Hudson to Mount Rutsen Road along River Road is now maintained by Dutchess County as part of CR 103. In Hyde Park, the former alignment of NY 9F along Market Street remained state-maintained until April 1, 1980, when it was transferred from New York State to Dutchess County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. Market Street is now part of CR 41. It has also been the site of a stretch of fatal or otherwise serious car accidents, some of which have involved hit and runs. A group of legislators is currently working on improving safety of the road between Bard College and Germantown. http://www.upperroute9g.com/posts/3180/looking-at-the-study-area- map-tell-us-where-you-have-difficulty-traveling-by-walking Major intersections See also References External links 009G U.S. Route 9 Transportation in Dutchess County, New York Transportation in Columbia County, New York ","title":"New York State Route 9G"},{"id":"4311427","text":"\\"Sam Hall\\" is an old English folk song about a bitterly unrepentant criminal condemned to death (Roud #369). Prior to the mid-19th century it was called \\"Jack Hall\\", after an infamous English thief, who was hanged in 1707 at Tyburn. Jack Hall's parents sold him as a climbing boy for one guinea, which is why most versions of the song identify Sam or Jack Hall as a chimney sweep.Roy Palmer: The Sound of History (1988)  History  Prior to 1988, the song had been collected from about 18 singers in the oral tradition, limited to Ireland, England and the USA and there had been only six sound recordings made.Musical Tradition (Mustrad) notes to Jack Hall, sung by Walter Pardon in 1976 Comic performer W. G. Ross adapted one version in the 1840s and changed the name from \\"Jack Hall\\" to \\"Sam Hall\\". The song also appears to have been adapted to fit the region in which it was sung; some versions refer to Sam Hall being hanged at Tyburn, some at Cootehill. Also it is unclear what, if any, uncouth language was original to the song. Various versions have Sam Hall call his executioners \\"muckers\\", \\"fuckers\\", \\"buggers\\", \\"muggers\\", \\"critters\\" or \\"bastards\\". The melody of the song was taken from the song \\"Captain Kidd\\", aka \\"Robert Kidd\\", written shortly after the execution of William Kidd in 1701. A more vulgar variant has become an enduring cultural phenomenon among United States Air Force pilots. Known as \\"Sammy Small\\", this may be the best known drinking song among American fighter pilots. Covered by Dos Gringos in 2006 on their album \\"2\\", the lyrics have remained consistent at least since the Vietnam War. Regarding the metrics and the melody, the version common in the British Isles (\\"Oh my name it is Sam Hall, chimney sweep...\\") appeared to be based on the tune \\"Ye Jacobites by Name\\" (Roud # 5517), whereas the version more common in the USA (\\"My name it is Sam Hall, T'is Sam Hall...\\") is a variant of the tune to \\"Frog Went A-Courting\\" (Roud # 16).

Thomas Minton (1765 ‚Äì 1836) was an English potter. He founded Thomas Minton & Sons in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, which grew into a major ceramic manufacturing company with an international reputation. During the early 1780s Thomas Minton was an apprentice engraver at the Caughley Pottery Works in Shropshire, under the proprietorship of Thomas Turner, working on copperplate engravings for the production of transferware.Sydney B. Williams, Antique Blue and White Spode, 3rd Edn, (Batsford, London 1949), p. 129. The engraver Thomas Lucas went from there to work for Josiah Spode at Stoke-on-Trent in 1783, taking some elements of the fashionable chinoiserie patterns with him.Robert Copeland, Spode's Willow Pattern, and other designs after the Chinese (Paperback edition, Studio Vista/Cassell, London 1990), p. 8. While at Caughley Thomas Minton is thought to have worked on chinoiserie landscape patterns including willows, and to have prepared copperplates of them:Williams, as above, p. 129; Copeland, as above, p. 14; W.B. Honey, English Pottery and Porcelain (A.C. Black, 1933), p. 190. but the Salopian works never produced the standard willow pattern which includes the bridge and the fence in the foreground.G.A. Godden, 'The Willow Pattern', The Antique Collector June 1972, pp. 148-50. Minton left the Salopian works in 1785, and married Sarah in London in 1789. In 1793 he established his own pottery factory in Stoke-upon-Trent principally for the manufacture of white-glazed earthen tablewares or pearlware including blue transfer printed and painted wares. Variations of his willow and other designs were acquired by Spode and other factories, and it was in this context that the English willow pattern was created. He was favoured and employed by Josiah Spode, for whom he engraved a new version of the pattern. To Minton is also attributed the popular 'Buffalo' pattern engraved for Spode.L. Jewitt, The Ceramic Art of Great Britain, 2nd Edn (J.S. Virtue, London 1883), p. 396; R. Copeland, as above, p. 116. He was assisted by Henry Doncaster of Penkhull: his pupil William Greatbatch (father of William Greatbatch (1802-1885), another notable engraver) became chief engraver for Spode and for the successor company, Copeland's.Arthur Hayden, Spode and his Successors (Cassell, London 1925), pp. 62-64. In c. 1796 Minton went into partnership with Joseph Poulson, who produced ornamental bone china at a factory nearby, and from c.1798 Minton employed Poulson's factory for his own china wares. After Poulson's death in 1808 he continued china production there until 1816. In 1824 he built a new factory for china, on the basis of which the company of 'Thomas Minton and Sons', known more simply as 'Mintons', was developed. At his death in 1836 his son Herbert Minton (1793-1858) continued and redeveloped the business. His portrait was made by James Northcote, R.A..

The route is in length and serves primarily as an access road to the Bash Bish Falls state parks on both sides of the New York‚ÄìMassachusetts border. The western terminus of NY 344 is at NY 22 in Copake Falls. Its eastern terminus is at the Massachusetts state line, where it continues into Bash Bish Falls State Park as Falls Road, a locally maintained highway. NY 344 was assigned and extended to its current length by 1953 after NY 22 was rerouted to bypass Copake Falls. Route description First reassurrance shield westbound on NY 344 NY 344 begins at an intersection with NY 22 in the hamlet of Copake Falls. The road heads to the southeast, turning eastward into Taconic State Park. NY 344 intersects with a few local roads at the border of the park, where it runs along the south base of Sunset Rock, an high, dual-state mountain. The route continues eastward, along the base of Cedar Mountain before beginning to ascend the mountain. While climbing Cedar Mountain, NY 344 crosses into Massachusetts and becomes the unnumbered Falls Road, a local roadway providing access to Bash Bish Falls State Park. History NY 344 was assigned to a highway extending from Copake Falls in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east. At the time, NY 22 served Copake Falls directly instead of bypassing it. NY 22 was rerouted to bypass Copake Falls on a new roadway to the west of the hamlet between 1947 and 1953. NY 344 was then extended northward on NY 22's former alignment to meet the new bypass north of Copake Falls. The southern half of NY 22's old routing into the hamlet remained state-maintained as well and is now New York State Route 980F, an unsigned reference route, and is signed on NY 22 as a southern branch of NY 344. In August and October 1955, NY 344 and the Taconic State Park south of the road was inundated with floods damaging the blacktop surface highway. The reconstruction of NY 344 was the center point of debate came in late February 1956, where Paul Winslow, the executive secretary of the Taconic State Park Commission, who felt it was unimportant if the road was rebuilt. Local officials in the town of Copake opposed Winslow's view, noting that it only cost $35,000 (1956 USD) to reconstruct the road. In April 1956, the county contacted State Senator Ernest Hatfield that the road was barricaded in Copake Falls for the fact that there was no residences and the fact that the Massachusetts side was wiped out by the flooding. In November 1956, a bid was let for $49,329 to reconstruct NY 344 including the construction of drainage facilities and shoulders along the road. The slated completion date was for July 31, 1957. However, progress on reconstruction of NY 344 was nearly complete by March 1957.

History  The medical thermometer began as an instrument more appropriately called a water thermoscope, constructed by Galileo Galilei circa 1592‚Äì1593. It lacked an accurate scale with which to measure temperature and could be affected by changes in atmospheric pressure. Italian physician Santorio Santorio is the first known individual to have put a measurable scale on the thermoscope and wrote of it in 1625, though he possibly invented one as early as 1612. His models were bulky, impractical and took a fair amount of time to take an accurate oral reading of the patient's temperature. Two individuals switched from water to alcohol in the thermometer. * The earliest is Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (1610‚Äì1670), who created an enclosed thermometer that used alcohol circa 1654. * Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit (1686‚Äì1736), a Polish-born Dutch physicist, engineer, and glass blower, made contributions to thermometers as well. He created an alcohol thermometer in 1709 and later innovated the mercury thermometer in 1714. Mercury, he found, responded more quickly to temperature changes than the previously used water. Fahrenheit also created the temperature scale which is named after him, having recorded the system in 1724. The scale is still only mainly used for everyday applications in the United States, its territories and associated states (all served by the U.S. National Weather Service) as well as the Bahamas, Belize, and the Cayman Islands.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica \\"Science & Technology: Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit\\" Prominent Dutch mathematician, astronomer and physicist Christiaan Huygens created a clinical thermometer in 1665, to which he added an early form of the Celsius scale by setting the scale to the freezing and boiling points of water. By 1742 Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius created the Celsius temperature scale that was the reverse of the modern scale, in that 0 was the boiling point of water, while 100 was freezing. It was later reversed by Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778) in 1744.Citation: Uppsala University (Sweden), Linnaeus' thermometer Working independently of Celsius, the Lyonnais physicist Jean-Pierre Christin, permanent secretary of the Acad√©mie des sciences, belles-lettres et arts de LyonFR, developed a similar scale in which 0 represented the freezing point of water and 100 represented boiling.Don Rittner; Ronald A. Bailey (2005): Encyclopedia of Chemistry. Facts On File, Manhattan, New York City. pp. 43. On 19 May 1743 he published the design of a mercury thermometer, the \\"Thermometer of Lyon\\" built by the craftsman Pierre Casati that used this scale.Mercure de France (1743): MEMOIRE sur la dilatation du Mercure dans le Thermom√©tre. Chaubert; Jean de Nully, Pissot, Duchesne, Paris. pp. 1609‚Äì1610.Journal helv√©tique (1743): LION. Imprimerie des Journalistes, Neuch√¢tel. pp. 308-310.Memoires pour L'Histoire des Sciences et des Beaux Arts (1743): DE LYON. Chaubert, Par√≠s. pp. 2125-2128. The medical thermometer was used by Dutch chemist and physician Hermann Boerhaave (1668‚Äì1738), as well as his notable students Gerard van Swieten (1700‚Äì72) and Anton de Haen (1704‚Äì76). It was also utilized around the same time by Scottish physician George Martine (1700‚Äì1741). De Haen made particular strides in medicine with the thermometer. By observing the correlation in a patient's change in temperature and the physical symptoms of the illness, he concluded that a record of one's temperature could inform the doctor of a patient's health. However, his proposals were not met with enthusiasm by his peers and the medical thermometer remained a scarcely used instrument in medicine. Thermometers remained cumbersome to transport and use. By the mid 19th century, the medical thermometer was still a foot long (30.28 cm) and took as long as twenty minutes to take an accurate temperature reading. Between 1866-1867, Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt (1836‚Äì1925) designed a medical thermometer that was much more portable, measuring only six inches long and taking only five minutes to record a patient's temperature. In 1868, German physician, pioneer psychiatrist, and medical professor Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich published his studies that consisted of over one million readings from twenty-five thousand patients' temperatures, taken in the underarm. With his findings, he was able to conclude a healthy human's temperature fell within the range of 36.3 to 37.5 ¬∞C (97.34 to 99.5 ¬∞F). Dr. Theodor H. Benzinger (13 April 1905 - 26 October 1999) invented the ear thermometer in 1964. Born in Stuttgart, Germany, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1947 and became a naturalized citizen in 1955. He worked from 1947 to 1970 in the bioenergetics division at the Naval Medical Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland.  Classification by location  The temperature can be measured in various locations on the body which maintain a fairly stable temperature (mainly oral, axillary, rectal, tympanic, or temporal). The normal temperature varies slightly with the location; an oral reading of 37 ¬∞C does not correspond to rectal, temporal, etc. readings of the same value. When a temperature is quoted the location should also be specified. If a temperature is stated without qualification (e.g., typical body temperature) it is usually assumed to be sub-lingual. The differences between core temperature and measurements at different locations, known as clinical bias, is discussed in the article on normal human body temperature. Measurements are subject to both site-dependent clinical bias and variability between a series of measurements (standard deviations of the differences). For example, one study found that the clinical bias of rectal temperatures was greater than for ear temperature measured by a selection of thermometers under test, but variability was less. = Oral = Oral temperature may only be taken from a patient who is capable of holding the thermometer securely under the tongue, which generally excludes small children or people who are unconscious or overcome by coughing, weakness, or vomiting. (This is less of a problem with fast-reacting digital thermometers, but is certainly an issue with mercury thermometers, which take several minutes to stabilise their reading.) If the patient has drunk a hot or cold liquid beforehand time must be allowed for the mouth temperature to return to its normal value. The typical range of a sub-lingual thermometer for use in humans is from about 35 ¬∞C to 42 ¬∞C or 90 ¬∞F to 110 ¬∞F. = Armpit = The armpit (axilla) temperature is measured by holding the thermometer tightly under the armpit. One needs to hold the thermometer for several minutes to get an accurate measurement. The axillary temperature plus 1 ¬∞C is a good guide to the rectal temperature in patients older than 1 month. The accuracy from the axilla is known to be inferior to the rectal temperature. = Rectal = different test prods (top: universal test prod, bottom: rectal test prod) Rectal thermometer temperature-taking, especially if performed by a person other than the patient, should be facilitated with the use of a water-based personal lubricant. Although rectal temperature is the most accurate, this method may be considered unpleasant or embarrassing in some countries or cultures, especially if used on patients older than young children; also, if not taken the correct way, rectal temperature-taking can be uncomfortable and in some cases painful for the patient. Rectal temperature-taking is considered the method of choice for infants.Fundamentals of Nursing by Barbara Kozier et al., 7th edition, p. 495 = Ear = The ear thermometer was invented by Dr. Theodor H. Benzinger in 1964. At the time, he was seeking a way to get a reading as close to the brain's temperature as possible, since the hypothalamus at the brain's base regulates the core body temperature. He accomplished this by using the ear canal's ear drum's blood vessels, which are shared with the hypothalamus. Before the ear thermometer's invention, easy temperature readings could only be taken from the mouth, rectum, or underarm. Previously, if doctors wanted to record an accurate brain temperature, electrodes needed to be attached to the patient's hypothalamus. This tympanic thermometer has a projection (protected by a one-time hygienic sheath) that contains the infrared probe; the projection is gently placed in the ear canal and a button pressed; the temperature is read and displayed within about a second. These thermometers are used both in the home and in medical facilities. There are factors that make readings of this thermometer to some extent unreliable, for example faulty placement in the external ear canal by the operator, and wax blocking the canal. Such error-producing factors usually cause readings to be below the true value, so that a fever can fail to be detected. = Forehead =  Temporal artery  Temporal artery thermometers, which use the infrared principle report temperature, are becoming increasingly common in clinical practice because of their ease of use and minimal invasiveness. Because of the variability of technique and environmental considerations, measurements by temporal artery thermometers may suffer issues of precision, and to a lesser degree accuracy. Temporal thermometers have been found to have a low sensitivity of around 60‚Äì70%, but a very high specificity of 97‚Äì100% for detecting fever and hypothermia. Because of this, it is suggested that they should not be used in acute care settings like the ICU, or in patients with a high suspicion of temperature imbalance. Evidence supports higher accuracy and precision amongst pediatric patients.  Plastic strip thermometer  The thermometer is applied to the patient's brow. It is typically a band coated with different temperature- sensitive markings using plastic strip thermometer or similar technology; at a given temperature the markings (numerals indicating the temperature) in one region are at the right temperature to become visible. This type may give an indication of fever, but is not considered accurate.  Classification by technology  =Liquid-filled= The traditional thermometer is a glass tube with a bulb at one end containing a liquid which expands in a uniform manner with temperature. The tube itself is narrow (capillary) and has calibration markings along it. The liquid is often mercury, but alcohol thermometers use a colored alcohol. Medically, a maximum thermometer is often used, which indicates the maximum temperature reached even after it is removed from the body. To use the thermometer, the bulb is placed in the location where the temperature is to be measured and left long enough to be certain to reach thermal equilibrium‚Äîtypically three minutes. Maximum-reading is achieved by means of a constriction in the neck close to the bulb. As the temperature of the bulb rises, the liquid expands up the tube through the constriction. When the temperature falls, the column of liquid breaks at the constriction and cannot return to the bulb, thus remaining stationary in the tube. After reading the value, the thermometer must be reset by repeatedly swinging it sharply to shake the liquid back through the constriction. Mercury  Mercury-in-glass thermometers have been considered the most accurate liquid- filled types. However, mercury is a toxic heavy metal, and mercury has only been used in clinical thermometers if protected from breakage of the tube. The tube must be very narrow to minimise the amount of mercury in it‚Äîthe temperature of the tube is not controlled, so it must contain very much less mercury than the bulb to minimise the effect of the temperature of the tube‚Äîand this makes the reading rather difficult as the narrow mercury column is not very visible. Visibility is less of a problem with a coloured liquid. In the 1990s it was decidedDirective 2007/51/EC as of 22 January 2013 that mercury-based thermometers were too risky to handle; the vigorous swinging needed to \\"reset\\" a mercury maximum thermometer makes it easy to accidentally break it and spill the moderately poisonous mercury. Mercury thermometers have largely been replaced by electronic digital thermometers, or, more rarely, thermometers based on liquids other than mercury (such as galinstan, coloured alcohols and heat-sensitive liquid crystals). = Phase-change (dot matrix) thermometers = Phase-change thermometers use samples of inert chemicals which melt at progressively higher temperatures from 35.5 ¬∞C to 40.5 ¬∞C in steps of 0.1 ¬∞C. They are mounted as small dots in a matrix on a thin plastic spatula with a protective transparent cover. This is placed under the patient‚Äôs tongue. After a short time the spatula is removed and it can be seen which dots have melted and which have not: the temperature is taken as the melting temperature of the last dot to melt. These are cheap disposable devices and avoid the need for sterilizing for re-use. http://www.npl.co.uk/publications/good-practice-online- modules/temperature/temperature-measurements-in-healthcare/phase-change-(dot- matrix)-thermometers/ = Liquid crystal = A liquid crystal thermometer contains heat-sensitive (thermochromic) liquid crystals in a plastic strip that change color to indicate different temperatures. =Electronic= Electronic clinical thermometer Quick test based on thermo chromic colours Since compact and inexpensive methods of measuring and displaying temperature became available, electronic thermometers (often called digital, because they display numeric values) have been used. Many display readings to great precision (0.1 ¬∞C or 0.2 ¬∞F, sometimes half that), but this should not be taken as a guarantee of accuracy: specified accuracy must be checked in documentation and maintained by periodical recalibration. A typical inexpensive electronic ear thermometer for home use has a displayed resolution of 0.1 ¬∞C, but a stated accuracy within ¬±0.2 ¬∞C (¬±0.35 ¬∞F) when new.Specification of typical inexpensive electronic ear thermometer The first electronic clinical thermometer, invented in 1954, used a flexible probe that contained a Carboloy thermistor.\\"Takes Temperature in Seconds.\\" Popular Mechanics, November 1954, p. 123. Types of Digital Thermometer Resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) RTDs are wire windings or other thin film serpentines that exhibit changes in resistance with changes in temperature. They measure temperature using the positive temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of metals. The hotter they become, the higher the value of their electrical resistance. Platinum is the most commonly used material because it is nearly linear over a wide range of temperatures, is very accurate, and has a fast response time. RTDs can also be made of copper or nickel. o Advantages of RTDs include their stable output for long periods of time. They are also easy to calibrate and provide very accurate readings. o Disadvantages include a smaller overall temperature range, higher initial cost, and a less rugged design Thermocouples Thermocouples are accurate, highly sensitive to small temperature changes, and quickly respond to changes to the environment. They consist of a pair of dissimilar metal wires joined at one end. The metal pair generates a net thermoelectric voltage between their opening and according to the size of the temperature difference between the ends. ‚Ä¢Advantages of thermocouples include their high accuracy and reliable operation over an extremely wide range of temperatures. They are also well- suited for making automated measurements both inexpensive and durable. ‚Ä¢Disadvantages include errors caused by their use over an extended period of time, and that two temperatures are required to make measurements. Thermocouple materials are subject to corrosion, which can affect the thermoelectric voltage Thermistor Thermistor elements are the most sensitive temperature sensors available. A thermistor is a semiconductor device with an electrical resistance that is proportional to temperature. There are two types of products. ‚Ä¢Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) devices are used in temperature sensing and are the most common type of thermistor. NTCs have temperatures that vary inversely with their resistance, so that when the temperature increases, the resistance decreases, and vice versa. NTCs are constructed from oxides of materials such as nickel, copper, and iron. ‚Ä¢ Positive temperature coefficient (PTC) devices are used in electric current control. They function in an opposite manner than NTC in that the resistance increases as temperature increases. PTCs are constructed from thermally sensitive silicons or polycrystalline ceramic materials. ‚Ä¢ There are several advantage and disadvantages to using an NTC thermistor thermometer. ‚Ä¢ Advantages include their small size and high degree of stability. NTCs are also long lasting and very accurate. ‚Ä¢ Disadvantages include their non- linearity, and unsuitability for use in extreme temperatures Contact Some electronic thermometers may work by contact (the electronic sensor is placed in the location where temperature is to be measured, and left long enough to reach equilibrium). These typically reach equilibrium faster than mercury thermometers; the thermometer may beep when equilibrium has been reached, or the time may be specified in the manufacturer's documentation. Remote Other electronic thermometers work by remote sensing: an infrared sensor responds to the radiation spectrum emitted from the location. Although these are not in direct contact with the area being measured, they may still contact part of the body (a thermometer which senses the temperature of the eardrum without touching it is inserted into the ear canal). To eliminate the risk of patient cross-infection, disposable probe covers and single-use clinical thermometers of all types are used in clinics and hospitals. Accuracy According to a 2001 research, electronic thermometers on the market significantly underestimate higher temperatures and overestimate lower temperatures. The researchers conclude that \\"the current generation of electronic, digital clinical thermometers, in general, may not be sufficiently accurate or reliable to replace the traditional glass/mercury thermometers\\"\\"An investigation into the accuracy of different types of thermometers\\" Nursing Times.net, 1 October 2002. =Basal thermometer= A basal thermometer is a thermometer used to take the basal (base) body temperature, the temperature upon waking. Basal body temperature is much less affected than daytime temperature by environmental factors such as exercise and food intake. This allows small changes in body temperature to be detected Glass oral thermometers typically have markings every 0.1 ¬∞C or 0.2 ¬∞F. Basal temperature is stable enough to require accuracy of at least 0.05 ¬∞C or 0.1 ¬∞F, so special glass basal thermometers are distinct from glass oral thermometers. Digital thermometers which have sufficient resolution (0.05 ¬∞C or 0.1 ¬∞F is sufficient) may be suitable for monitoring basal body temperatures; the specification should be checked to ensure absolute accuracy, and thermometers (like most digital instruments) should be calibrated at specified intervals. If only the variation of basal temperature is required, absolute accuracy is not so important so long as the readings do not have large variability (e.g., if real temperature varies from 37.00 ¬∞C to 37.28 ¬∞C, a thermometer which inaccurately but consistently reads a change from 37.17 ¬∞C to 37.45 ¬∞C will indicate the magnitude of the change). Some digital thermometers are marketed as \\"basal thermometers\\" and have extra features such as a larger display, expanded memory functions, or beeping to confirm the thermometer is placed properly.  Smart and wearable thermometers  A smart thermometer is able to transmit its readings so that they can be collected, stored and analysed. Wearable thermometers can provide continuous measurement but it is difficult to measure core body temperature in this way.

History Several writers have claimed to have created spam poetry, and consensus has not emerged about a single origin. Some early examples come from a spam poetry competition held in 2000 by the website Satire Wire. Canadian poet Rob Read began writing and sending out spam poems to a group of 'subscribers' through his Daily Treated Spam email series in September, 2003. A selection from the first two years were published as O Spam, Poams: Selected Daily Treated Spam in 2005 by BookThug. Daily Treated Spam continued until 2011, and a new series, subtitled Spamdemic, began in August 2020. Animator Don Hertzfeldt began writing spam poems in his production journal in 2004. Translator Jorge Candeias wrote Portuguese \\"spoems\\" daily, between 5 May 2003 and 5 May 2004, using spam subject lines as title and inspiration. A book entitled Machine Language by endwar was published in 2005 by IZEN and was followed by Machine Language, Version 2.1 also by endwar in 2006. The latter edition includes a CD of spoetry read by Microsoft Sam and set to ambient musical sounds by Michael Truman who also tweaked the automated readings. Each edition indicates endwar as editor, but in the second edition he has admitted to using cut-up technique and having combined shorter pieces from the first edition, which lends more authorship to him in his creation. These pieces were also read at the opening of Blends & Bridges, a concrete and visual poetry show at Gallery 324 in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 1, 2006, by endwar with the sounds by Truman backing. The experimental poet, endwar, cites his own collaboration with Ficus Strangulensis, the experimental poet, in 1995, The Further Last Words of Dutch Schultz published by IZEN as an earlier experiment in generating random text poetry, in this case, the software altered text of the bizarre last words of Dutch Schultz as published in The New York Times in 1935, as well as the cut- up influences of Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs and even the musicians Throbbing Gristle and David Bowie.[intro to Machine Language, Version 2.1, endwar, IZEN, 2006] The useful bits of spam for purposes of endwar's variation of spoetry, i.e., the part that is not the advertisement, but the random words assigned to trick spam filters, endwar calls \\"paratext\\". Endwar indicates that, in his view, \\"the effect of the evolution of paratext is that computers are learning to talk to each other by in some sense imitating human texts.\\" [intro to Machine Language, endwar, IZEN, 2005] The advertisements are the human-to-human conversation in the same email sources. A book entitled 'Spam: E-mail Inspired Poems' by Ben Myers was published in 2008 by Blackheath Books Myers claims to have been writing spam poems since 1999. The creation of spoetry is similar to Gysin and Burroughs's cut-up technique in that individual subject lines of messages are pieced together in poetic form; making the creation of spoetry an exercise not in creativity as much as in having an eye for the unexpected. The end result can be crafted into any literary form the author desires: haiku, concrete poetry, limerick, dada, and so on. Thus, spoetry is not a literary form but rather a means of creating poetry. A related concept is spam lit, where snippets of nonsensical verse and prose are embedded in spam e-mail messages. Some of the snippets are original content, others are passages or conglomerations from public-domain works. The term was coined by a member of the Poetics listserv in 2002. In August 2006, David Kestenbaum of NPR's Morning Edition broadcast a story on \\"Literary Spam\\". Kestenbaum notes that Paul Graham, a programmer, \\"wrote a program to find out how to best separate spam from real e-mail. To train it, he fed it a good helping of spam and a separate sample of real e-mail.\\" Soon, spammers discovered the works of long-dead poets and writers as one way to circumvent Graham's anti-spam code.

The thirteen-part serial follows Marv on his single-minded quest to understand why Goldie was killed and bring revenge upon her murderers. This story is one of three Sin City stories retold in the movie Sin City. In the film version, Mickey Rourke plays Marv, Jaime King plays Goldie and Wendy, Carla Gugino plays Lucille, Elijah Wood plays Kevin, and Rutger Hauer plays Cardinal Roark. A Dame to Kill For First published November 1993‚ÄìMay 1994, A Dame to Kill For is the second compilation of the Sin City series. It chronicles Dwight's attempts to rescue Ava Lord, his former fianc√©e, from her husband and servant, who she says are sadistically torturing her. Dwight begins to suspect that things aren't what they seem with Ava. Cover of Sin City: A Dame To Kill For, 2nd edition The story begins as Dwight McCarthy, working as a photographer for a grossly overweight man named Agamemnon, saves one of the Old Town prostitutes from one of her customers, whom Dwight was investigating on behalf of his wife; he then drives her back to Old Town. That night, he receives a call from a woman named Ava, asking him to meet her at a seedy bar called Kadie's Club Pecos. Dwight is suspicious of her, as Ava broke his heart four years ago by running off with another richer man, but he agrees to meet her anyway. Marv is also there and greets Dwight. Ava arrives late (as she often used to) and tries to persuade Dwight to take her back, claiming that her life is \\"a living Hell\\"; Dwight refuses to listen. Just then, Manute, Ava's husband's valet, arrives and takes Ava away. Dwight goes home, but cannot sleep. He decides to check up on Ava and her new husband, Damien Lord. He hops a fence and, using his photography equipment, scopes out the estate and, in particular, Ava, who is swimming in the nude. He is discovered and claims that he is simply a Peeping Tom. Manute, who seemingly doesn't recognize him from the bar, beats him brutally before throwing him from a car into the street. Dwight calls Agamemnon for a ride home and they stop several times for fast food. As Dwight arrives home, he finds his Ford Mustang returned and his door unlocked. In his bedroom is a nude Ava. Following a heated argument, they eventually reconcile and make love. Manute arrives and violently beats naked Dwight. Dwight is knocked out of his upper story apartment window to the street below, where he blacks out momentarily. He awakens to see Manute driving off with Ava. Determined to rescue her, Dwight arrives at Kadie‚Äôs, where Marv is in the middle of a squabble with some out-of-town punks. One of them pulls a gun on Marv, who knocks him flat; the rest quickly scatter. Dwight convinces Marv, over several drinks and whilst watching Nancy dance, to help him storm Damien's estate. As they approach the mansion, Dwight insists Marv leave the punk's gun, which Marv has procured, in the car. Marv tackles the guards as a distraction and eventually takes on Manute, ripping his right eye out and beating him savagely. With Manute and the guards occupied, Dwight makes his way to Damien. When he finds him in his office, he beats him to death. As Dwight begins to realize what he has done, Ava appears, and explains how Dwight was all a part of her plan to get Damien murdered so she could inherit his estate. She shoots Dwight six times, including once in the head. Dwight once again falls out of a window and is picked up by Marv. Upon Dwight's insistence, Marv drives him to Old Town, where Dwight has his old flame, Gail, help him. The girls of Old Town perform surgery on Dwight's multiple bullet wounds, then ask him to leave. He convinces Gail and Miho, a deadly assassin he saved three years prior, to let him stay, and they operate further on him. Two detectives following up on Damien Lord's death, Mort and Bob, talk to Ava. She claims that Dwight was a stalker psychopath who killed Damien out of jealousy. They believe her story, and Mort starts sleeping with her. They interrogate Agamemnon, who tells how Dwight is an upright man who went clean after being a wild alcoholic with a short temper in his younger days. When they speak with Dwight's landlady, she tells about letting Ava in and the resulting loud noises of the fight the night of Damien's murder. Bob doubts Ava considerably now, while Mort, who is still sleeping with her, becomes more on-edge towards his partner. This culminates with Mort killing Bob, then committing suicide. (On an unrelated note, during the scene in which Mort kills Bob, while they are driving in the car you can clearly see Wendy and Marv drive past them, presumably on their way to butcher Kevin.) Meanwhile, Dwight is recovering from his near-fatal wounds and calls Ava to inform her he's coming for her soon. Ava, with her late husband's financial assets, is joining her corporation with the mob boss Wallenquist. Unaffected by Ava's flirting, he warns her not to underestimate him again and tells her to tie up her loose ends with Dwight; he has someone arriving from Phoenix soon to meet her about that. Dwight (with his new face), accompanied by Gail and Miho, poses as Wallenquist's man from Phoenix. Inside Ava's estate, however, Manute sees past the new face and captures Dwight. Gail and Miho strike from Dwight's car, and Dwight shoots Manute with a hidden .25 he had up his left sleeve. Six bullets fail to kill him, and Manute aims shakily at Dwight as Ava grabs one of Manute's guns, shooting Manute in his shoulder. Manute falls through a window and, upon landing, is stabbed in the arms by Miho, pinning him to the ground. Ava then tries to get Dwight to kill him, telling him that Manute had her under mind control to manipulate her and Damien and that it would be a cruel irony if he killed her now. Dwight finally sees through all the lies and kills Ava. The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories First published November 1994, The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories is a publication of short stories: * \\"And Behind Door Number Three...\\" (4 pages long) * \\"The Customer Is Always Right\\" (3 pages long) ‚Äì first published in San Diego Comic Con Comics #2 (August 1993) * \\"The Babe Wore Red\\" (23 pages long) It reprints a serial run in Previews. \\"And Behind Door Number Three...\\" is a short story about Gail and Wendy (who's now wearing Marv's necklace) setting a trap for a man they suspect is 'carving up' girls in Old Town. The enigmatic \\"Cowboy\\" is captured by the allure of Wendy and subsequently shot and tied up by Gail. Although the Cowboy is willing to confess to the cops, the girls have other plans and invite Miho to finish the job. \\"The Customer Is Always Right\\" served as the opening sequence for the film Sin City, which featured Josh Hartnett and Marley Shelton. The sequence served as the original proof of concept footage that director Robert Rodriguez filmed to convince Frank Miller to allow him to adapt Sin City to the silver screen. The story involves an enigmatic tryst between two nameless characters; \\"The Customer\\" and \\"The Salesman.\\" They meet on the terrace of a high rise building, hinting that although they seem to be acting like strangers, they do indeed have some sort of past. It is unclear what their past involves even as they embrace in a passionate kiss. A silenced gunshot stabs the night air to reveal that The Salesman has shot The Customer. The reader is led to believe that The Customer had fallen into a serious and difficult situation and, with no other feasible alternative, hired The Salesman to kill her. Later information given by Frank Miller on the commentary of the Recut & Extended DVD Edition states that The Customer had an affair with a member of the mafia, and when she found out tried to break it off with him. The mafia member then swore to her that she would die in the most terrible way possible, and when it is least expected. The Customer, having connections, hires The Salesman (who is referred to as \\"The Lady- Killer\\") to kill her. In the comic The Salesman is the Colonel, as Miller has verified in the BLAM! section page 29 of the one-shot issue \\"Sex & Violence.\\" \\"The Babe Wore Red\\" centers around the character of Dwight and the murder of his friend Fargo. Dwight stumbles upon the hanging corpse of Fargo in his apartment and encounters Mr Shlubb, half of the recurring supporting duo, Douglas Klump and Burt Shlubb (aka Fat Man and Little Boy). He knocks out Shlubb and finds the titular character hiding in the shower. Under a barrage of sniper shots from Douglas Klump, Dwight and the Babe reach their car and speed off. Although they successfully elude the pair, Dwight refuses to let them off easy, choosing rather to head to The Farm to deal with them. In the meantime, the Babe introduces herself as a hooker named Mary, but Dwight can tell she's lying. He duels with both of them again and due to insistence from Mary decides to shoot them in the leg instead of killing them. He eventually receives a package from Fargo who had shipped it off before his untimely demise. Dwight reads up on the whole situation and realizes that Fargo was simply the scapegoat for illegal drug-related activities and had paid the ultimate price. He also receives a package from Mary. She was not a hooker, rather a nun that had flirted with temptation before ultimately deciding to dedicate her life to God. The time frame for the story is given as during the time Marv spent on death row in \\"The Hard Goodbye\\", as noted when Dwight mentions that he had a friend on death row because of what happened at the Roark family farm. The Big Fat Kill thumb First published in five issues November 1994-March 1995, The Big Fat Kill opens in Shellie's apartment, where a drunken former fling is furiously rapping on her door, demanding to be let in. Shellie is obviously scared, but is comforted by Dwight who has gotten a new face (see A Dame To Kill For). Dwight tells the barmaid to let the man and his ensuing entourage in, expressing confidence in his ability to 'handle them'. When the man outside threatens to break down her door, Shellie reluctantly opens it while Dwight hides in the bathroom. Dwight deals with the man, who then leaves, heading into Old Town. The story deals with the repercussions of Dwight's and the Old Town Girls' actions towards him. The story is one of three from Sin City related in the film Sin City. In the film, Clive Owen plays Dwight, Brittany Murphy plays Shellie, Benicio del Toro plays Jack, Rosario Dawson plays Gail, Devon Aoki plays Miho, Alexis Bledel plays Becky, and Michael Clarke Duncan plays Manute. \\"Silent Night\\" \\"Silent Night\\" is a one-shot short story that Frank Miller released in November 1995. It is a 26-page story featuring Marv. It has almost no dialogue; only one speech bubble appears in the entire story. The original issue had no functional cover, i.e. the story started on the top page, which had no title, author or publisher information. These were appended at the end of the issue. Against a backdrop of heavy snow, Marv (a hulking, scarred figure in a trenchcoat) approaches a door in a dark alley. He intimidates the bouncer, Fatman, by simply glaring at him, and is let in. He proceeds down a flight of stairs, and is met by two men with machine pistols and a leather-clad woman, who is apparently their boss. Marv hands her a wad of bills and is shown to a steel door in the far wall. Through a small viewing slit, he can see a terrified little girl crouching in darkness in the room beyond. It is not stated, but is apparent that the child was being sold for sex. Marv draws two pistols and kills the pair of henchmen, then executes the woman, the only time he kills a woman in all of his Sin City appearances. He says to the little girl, \\"Your momma's been asking after you, Kimberly. Let's get you home.\\" Cuddling the girl gently in his arms, he walks off into the distance, as the snow obscures his receding form. That Yellow Bastard Cover to That Yellow Bastard #1. Art by Frank Miller. It shows a menacing-looking Detective Hartigan. First published in February 1996-July 1996, That Yellow Bastard is a six-issue comic book miniseries, and the sixth in the Sin City series. It follows the usual black and white noir style artistry of previous Sin City novels. The first collected edition by Dark Horse Comics became available in July 1997 (). The story begins more than eight years before any other Sin City book takes place, with possibly the most noble, and heroic protagonist in the Sin City universe, policeman John Hartigan (suffering from severe angina problems) on his final mission before his forced retirement. Roark Junior, son of one of the most powerful and corrupt officials in Basin City, is indulging his penchant for raping and murdering pre-pubescent girls. It is Hartigan's mission to rescue Junior's latest quarry, a thin eleven-year-old named Nancy Callahan. Hartigan rescues her, but only after severely wounding Junior and sending him into a coma. Hartigan is then framed for kidnapping and raping Nancy, and sent to prison for eight years, until he manages to achieve parole and attempts to locate and protect Nancy from Roark's men. In the film adaptation, Bruce Willis stars as Hartigan, Jessica Alba as Nancy, Nick Stahl as the Yellow Bastard/Junior, Powers Boothe as Senator Roark and Michael Madsen as Hartigan's partner, Bob. There are only a few notable differences in the film version: Mort is replaced by Bob when Hartigan is released from prison, an appearance by Carla Gugino as Lucille is omitted (but reinstated in the extended version released to DVD), and Senator Roark (Powers Boothe) has a mustache. In the DVD commentary, Frank Miller indicated that he was initially motivated to write That Yellow Bastard after his disappointment with The Dead Pool, the fifth and final film in the Dirty Harry series. Nancy‚Äîwho prior to this story had no last name‚Äîwas named \\"Callahan\\", a name shared with Clint Eastwood's character. \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" was first published in A Decade of Dark Horse #1 (July 1996) and reprinted in Tales to Offend #1 (July 1997), Booze, Broads, and Bullets, and Dark Horse Day 2016 Sampler (June 2016). Johnny is a middle-aged man who seems to be in love with a much younger girl by the name of Amy. Amy insists that they cannot be together and alludes to the solution that he kills her father. Torn by his emotions and manipulated by Amy, he attempts to confront her father first, asking for her hand in marriage. Daddy refuses and Johnny shoots him with a revolver that Amy gave him. Daddy then reveals that the gun was in fact loaded with blanks and was a plot orchestrated by him and Amy. The two are either lovers with a daddy/daughter fetish based relationship or a father and daughter in an incestuous relationship. Daddy strangles Johnny for sexual satisfaction, and it implied this was the only way he was able to become aroused. Lost, Lonely, & Lethal First published December 1996, Lost, Lonely & Lethal contains three stories: * \\"Fat Man and Little Boy\\" (3 pages) ‚Äì first published in San Diego Comic Con Comics #4 (July 1996) * \\"Blue Eyes\\" (14 pages) * \\"Rats\\" (7 pages) \\"Fat Man and Little Boy\\" is a short three-page story about Douglas Klump and Burt Shlubb, who also appear in That Yellow Bastard and Family Values. These characters use a large vocabulary to make it appear that they are more intelligent than they truthfully are. However their wordy speeches are sprinkled with malapropisms. In this yarn, Shlubb's boots are in horrible shape, and he wishes to steal the shoes off a corpse, wrapped in a rug, that they're supposed to dump in the river. Klump tells him that they're supposed to leave the body as it is. Shlubb disagrees and pulls the boots off, to discover that there are no feet in them, and a ticking sound rings through their ears. This was apparently a test, and the two buffoons get thrown several yards away as the explosion hits. It seems they failed the test miserably. \\"Blue Eyes\\", the second story, begins as a man named Jim notices someone he assumes is a hitman following him. He runs into Kadie's, where he is confronted by an ex-flame named Delia. Marv is sitting next to them at the bar, and provides some comic relief. The hitman enters the bar, and Jim convinces Delia to leave with him. Marv then steals his drink, reasoning that it would have gone to waste otherwise. Jim and Delia go back to his place and make love. She then attacks him, and explains that this is her test. She wants to become a hitwoman, and she must first kill the only man she ever loved. After killing Jim, the Colonel appears - he was the 'hitman' who had been following Jim. He gives her an assignment, and she takes on the name 'Blue Eyes', which is what Jim used to call her. Blue Eyes is shown to take place at the same time as A Dame To Kill For, as part of the story shows Gail telling Shelley what to tell the police about Dwight. The story also has brief appearances by many characters, including Miho, Agammemnon and Manute. \\"Rats\\" is the final story, it is about a disturbed war criminal who eats dog food. It was adapted to a 2004 fan film of the same name. A sadistic war criminal (and presumed Nazi) stuffs rats in his oven to eat as he mentally rambles about the London Blitz, his arthritis, and how he killed all the 'rats', which were all people. A vigilante known amongst readers as 'The Janitor' kicks down the door and incapacitates him, before shoving his head into the oven, gassing him to death. Sex & Violence Sex & Violence was first published in March 1997 and only contains two stories, both of which feature Delia: * \\"Wrong Turn\\" (23 pages) * \\"Wrong Track\\" (3 pages) The two stories take place on the same night, with the second taking place minutes after the first. \\"Wrong Turn\\" is the first story, in which a man named Phil drives aimlessly in the rain, eventually finding Delia unconscious on a dirt road. He picks her up, and she tells him that she must have got struck by lightning. He offers to take her to the hospital, but she refuses. She asks if he is married, and he says that he is not. She takes him to the pits, and they make love. In the middle of it, he confesses that he is, in fact, married. She starts choking him and calls him by the name of Eddie. She claims he has a trunk-load of stolen jewels he plans to sell in Sacred Oaks, violating an exclusivity agreement with the Wallenquist Organization. He explains that he is a used car salesman named Phil, and she understands. Eddie was supposed to be driving a similar Studebaker, and looked very similar. She sticks the heel of her shoe in his eye socket, killing him. She meets up with the Colonel and Gordo at the entrance to the pits. They check the trunk of Phil's car and find his wife with six bullets in her chest. They throw him in as well and Gordo pushes the car into the pits. Delia explains that she has a train to catch. \\"Wrong Track\\" is the second story, which picks up soon after. Eddie is riding the train. His internal monologue explains that he had a flat tire. Delia hits on him, and they make love near the back of the train. When they're done, she snaps his neck and throws him off the train. Leaving the rear of the train, the Colonel waits for her. \\"Delia-- do you plan to make love to each and every one of them?\\" he asks. Her response is \\"Only the ones I like.\\" \\"Just Another Saturday Night\\" \\"Just Another Saturday Night\\" was first published in Sin City #1/2 (August 1997), a limited mail-in comic available only through a special offer in Wizard #73. It was later reprinted in a mass-market edition as Just Another Saturday Night (October 1998). It is the story of what Marv was up to on the night John Hartigan met back up with Nancy (from That Yellow Bastard). Marv regains consciousness on a highway overlooking the Projects, surrounded by dead young guys, unable to remember how he got there. He lights one of the dead guys' cigarettes and thinks back; since it is Saturday, he deduces he must have been at Kadie's watching Nancy dance. Marv was rather depressed after seeing Nancy leave with Hartigan, as he had always had an unrequited crush on her, so the barkeep gives him a bottle to drown his sorrow with. He gets drunk and steps outside, only to find some preppy college kids trying to burn drunks and winos to death. He immediately kills one of them and chases the rest to The Projects, where along the way he destroys a police patrol car and hijacks another vehicle. At the Projects, it is clear that they are being watched, but Marv uses hand signals to identify himself and instruct his former neighbors to attack the kids, and they do so by firing arrows at them and providing Marv with a knife. After questioning the last surviving kid about him being called 'Bernini boy' (it was the name of the brand of coat he was wearing), he slits his throat. This done, he muses, \\"And one fine coat it is. Somebody must've spent a fortune on it. I wonder who?\\" But he cannot seem to remember where he got the coat or gloves. The story served as the opening sequence for the film Sin City: A Dame to Kill For. Family Values Family Values was first published in (October 1997) and was the fifth \\"yarn\\" in Frank Miller's Sin City series. Unlike the previous four stories, Family Values was released as a 128-page graphic novel rather than in serialized issues that would later be collected in a trade paperback volume. The plot concerns Dwight and Miho going on a mission from Gail to dig up information about a recent mob hit at a small diner. Booze, Broads, & Bullets Booze, Broads, & Bullets is a compilation of stories from the Sin City series of comic books by Frank Miller. It reprints all the short stories, in the following order: * \\"Just Another Saturday Night\\" (from Sin City #1/2 and also reprinted in Just Another Saturday Night) * \\"Fat Man and Little Boy\\" (from Lost, Lonely, & Lethal) * \\"The Customer Is Always Right\\" (from The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories) * \\"Silent Night\\" (from Silent Night) * \\"And Behind Door Number Three...\\" (from The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories) * \\"Blue Eyes\\" (from Lost, Lonely, & Lethal) * \\"Rats\\" (from Lost, Lonely, & Lethal) * \\"Daddy's Little Girl\\" (from A Decade of Dark Horse #1 and also reprinted in Tales to Offend #1) * \\"Wrong Turn\\" (from Sex & Violence) * \\"Wrong Track\\" (from Sex & Violence) * \\"The Babe Wore Red\\" (from The Babe Wore Red and Other Stories) Hell and Back Hell and Back was first published in (July 1999-April 2000) Hell and Back is the longest of the Sin City stories, spanning 9 issues. It tells the story of Wallace, an artist/war hero/short order cook who saves a suicidal woman named Esther. She likes his art and they go out for a drink. They are ambushed by two men, who drug Wallace and kidnap Esther. When Wallace recovers, he vows to find Esther and deal with those who kidnapped her.

Portugal, which first colonized the area in the 16th century, enforced a colonial pact with Brazil, an imperial mercantile policy, which drove development for the subsequent three centuries. Independence was achieved in 1822. Slavery was fully abolished in 1888. Important structural transformations began in the 1930s, when important steps were taken to change Brazil into a modern, industrialized economy. A socioeconomic transformation took place rapidly after World War II. In the 1940s, only 31.3% of Brazil's 41.2 million inhabitants resided in towns and cities; by 1991, of the country's 146.9 million inhabitants 75.5% lived in cities, and Brazil had two of the world's largest metropolitan centers: S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The share of the primary sector in the gross national product declined from 28% in 1947 to 11% in 1992. In the same 1947‚Äì92 period, the contribution of industry to GNP increased from less than 20‚Äì39%. The industrial sector produces a wide range of products for the domestic market and for export, including consumer goods, intermediate goods, and capital goods. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the Brazilian economy suffered from rampant inflation that subdued economic growth. After several failed economic initiatives created by the government, in 1994 the Plano Real was introduced. This plan brought stability and enabled Brazil to sustain economic growth over that of the global economy through the coming decade. Despite this rapid development the country still suffers from high levels of corruption, violent crime, functional illiteracy and poverty.  Colonial period  Brazil belonged to the Kingdom of Portugal as a colony. European commercial expansion of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Blocked from the lucrative hinterland trade with the Far East, which was dominated by Italian cities, Portugal began in the early fifteenth century to search for other routes to the sources of goods valued in European markets. Portugal discovered the maritime passage to the East Indies around the southern tip of Africa and established a network of trade outposts throughout Africa and Asia. After the discovery of America, it competed with Spain in occupying the New World. Initially, the Portuguese did not find mineral riches in their American colony, but they never lost the hope of someday finding such riches there. Meanwhile, in order to settle and defend the colony from European intruders, the Portuguese established a pioneer colonial enterprise: the production of sugar in the Northeast. Beginning in about 1532‚Äì1534, cattle began arriving in Brazil, and a cattle industry developed rapidly in response to the needs of the sugar industry for transportation and food for workers. The discovery of precious metals in the colony's Center-South (Centro-Sul), a relatively undefined region encompassing the present-day Southeast (Sudeste) and South (Sul) regions, came only in the eighteenth century. = Sugar cycle (1540‚Äì1640) = By the mid-16th century, Portugal had succeeded in establishing a sugar economy in parts of the colony's northeastern coast. Sugar production, the first large-scale colonial agricultural enterprise, was made possible by a series of favorable conditions. Portugal had the agricultural and manufacturing know-how from its Atlantic islands and manufactured its own equipment for extracting sugar from sugarcane. Furthermore, being involved in the African slave trade, it had access to the necessary manpower. Finally, Portugal relied on the commercial skills of the Dutch and financing from Holland to enable a rapid penetration of sugar in Europe's markets. Until the early seventeenth century, the Portuguese and the Dutch held a virtual monopoly on sugar exports to Europe. However, between 1580 and 1640 Portugal was incorporated into Spain, a country at war with Holland. The Dutch occupied Brazil's sugar area in the Northeast from 1630 to 1654, establishing direct control of the world's sugar supply. When the Dutch were driven out in 1654, they had acquired the technical and organizational know-how for sugar production. Their involvement in the expansion of sugar in the Caribbean contributed to the downfall of the Portuguese monopoly. The Caribbean sugar boom brought about a steady decline in world sugar prices. Unable to compete, Brazilian sugar exports, which had peaked by the mid- seventeenth century, declined sharply. Between the fourth quarter of the seventeenth century and the early eighteenth century, Portugal had difficulties in maintaining its American colony. The downfall of sugar revealed a fragile colonial economy, which had no commodity to replace sugar. Paradoxically, however, the period of stagnation induced the settlement of substantial portions of the colony's territory. With the decline of sugar, the cattle sector, which had evolved to supply the sugar economy with animals for transport, meat, and hides, assimilated part of the resources made idle, becoming a subsistence economy. Because of extensive cattle production methods, large areas in the colony's interior were settled. Realizing that it could maintain Brazil only if precious minerals were discovered, Portugal increased its exploratory efforts in the late seventeenth century. As a result, early in the eighteenth century gold and other precious minerals were found. The largest concentration of this gold was in the Southeastern Highlands, mainly in what is now Minas Gerais State. = Economy at independence (1822) = Despite Brazil's economic troubles, the early nineteenth century was a period of change. First, the Napoleonic Wars forced the Portuguese royal family to flee to Portugal's colony of Brazil in 1808, and for a short period the colony became the seat of the Portuguese empire. Moreover, in 1808 Britain persuaded Portugal to open the colony to trade with the rest of the world, and Portugal rescinded its prohibition against manufacturing (Strangford Treaty). Indeed, during this period, the Portuguese royal family and the noblemen who had established themselves in the territory, started many reforms which developed the educational, cultural and economical sectors of Brazil. By 1814, the Portuguese and their allies had defeated Napoleon's armies in the Peninsular War, after had been victorious in the war against the French invasion of Portugal by 1811. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which started in Porto, demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821, but his son Pedro remained in Rio de Janeiro as regent and governor of the newly created Kingdom of Brazil, a Portuguese possession within the new United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (1815‚Äì22). These events paved the way for Brazil's independence on September 7, 1822. Brazil's early years as an independent nation were extremely difficult. 1820-1872 for Brazil was a combination of stagnation and regional diversity. According to Leff (1982, 1997), from the time of Brazil's independence in 1822, its rate of GDP growth failed to outpace its population growth. Hence, while the population did expand at a rapid pace (nearly 2 per cent per annum), the country's efforts to improve its performance in per capita terms were largely frustrating until the start of the twentieth century. This protracted and very difficult period of stagnation was, however, the net results of widely varying trends in different regions of the country. The north-eastern part of Brazil, which was a platform for sugar and cotton exports and which accounted for 57 per cent of the country's exports at the start of this period, saw a steady decline in its external sales. In 1866‚Äì70, these crops represented just 30 per cent of exports, while the share of coffee exports-the leading product in the south-eastern portion of the country-jumped from 26 to 47 per cent. Leff (1982, 1997) explains the decline experiences in the north-east in terms of Dutch disease. As coffee exports came to play a greater role in the foreign exchange market, the real exchange rate increasingly reflected the importance of that product, which had a negative impact on the less competitive regions, such as the north-east. It was neither possible to restructure the sugar industry very quickly, nor easy to promote large-scale inter-regional migration flows, although a large number of slaves did move from the north-east to the south-east. Throughout this period, the expansion of the coffee industry was not hindered by any increase in labor costs, since up to 1852 (end of the slave trade), wages were depressed by the presence of slave labor and later by subsidized immigration flows, particularly from Italy (Leff 1997:5). This strengthened the existing pattern in Brazil: an export sector that generated high levels of earnings alongside a large sector that catered to the domestic market and a large subsistence economy, both with very low levels of productivity, with the outcome being low per capita income levels but a high export coefficient relative to the other Latin American economies. Exports declined, and the domestic economy was depressed. The only segment that expanded was the subsistence economy. Resources (land, slaves, and transport animals) made idle by the decline of the export economy were absorbed into mostly self-consumption activities.  American‚ÄìBrazilian economic relations (1870‚Äì1930)  In 1870 Brazil's trade with America was valued at about 31 million dollars while the combined trade of all the South American countries was valued at about $29 million. Brazil was a significant producer of coffee and because of this the United States imported about four times as much as it exported to Brazil. In 1885 Brazil was producing more than one half of the world's supply of coffee. Brazil's trade in 1890 was more than $71 million while that of Argentina and Uruguay was $14 million and $6 million respectively. Soon after 1896, the production of coffee started to surpass consumption and prices began to fall in Brazil. Brazil then stored their coffee instead of selling all of it, and when there was bad season of coffee production they would use what they had previously stored from the year before. The Monroe Doctrine appeared to some South American states as a US attempt of preserving their control over that hemisphere. Brazil viewed this doctrine as a measure of protection against the interference of the US and from European nations. Brazil's first ambassador to the United States, Joaquim Nabuco, 1905‚Äì10, was a partisan of the Monroe Doctrine. Brazil borrowed money from many nations but it was not until after World War One that it actually borrowed substantial amounts from the US. With the outbreak of the First World War, Brazil continued to share the most significant trade with America with a trade that was valued at $154 million.  Coffee economy (1840‚Äì1930)  The impact of coffee on the Brazilian economy was much stronger than that of sugar and gold. When the coffee surge began, Brazil was already free from the limitations of colonialism. Moreover, the substitution of slave labor for wage labor after 1870 (slavery was abolished in 1888) meant an increase in efficiency and the formation of a domestic market for wage goods. Finally, the greater complexity of coffee production and trade established important sectorial linkages within the Brazilian economy. Coffee was introduced in Brazil early in the eighteenth century, but initially it was planted only for domestic use. It took the high world prices of the late 1820s and early 1830s to turn coffee into a major export item. During the initial phase, production was concentrated in the mountainous region near Rio de Janeiro. This area was highly suitable for coffee cultivation, and it had access to fairly abundant slave labor. Moreover, the coffee could be transported easily on mule trains or on animal-drawn carts over short distances to the ports. An entrepreneurial class established in Rio de Janeiro during the mining surge was able to induce the government to help create basic conditions for the expansion of coffee, such as removing transportation and labor bottlenecks. From the area near Rio de Janeiro, coffee production moved along the Para√≠ba Valley toward S√£o Paulo State, which later became Brazil's largest exporting region. Coffee was cultivated with primitive techniques and with no regard to land conservation. Land was abundant, and production could expand easily through the incorporation of new areas. However, it soon became necessary to ease two basic constraints: the lack of transportation and the shortage of labor. Francisco Paulo de Almeida (1826-1901), first and only Baron of Guaraciaba, title granted by Princess Isabel. Negro, he possessed one of the greatest fortunes of the imperial period, getting to own, on their coffee plantations, approximately one thousand slaves. The cultivation of coffee farther away from ports required the construction of railroads, first around Rio de Janeiro and into the Para√≠ba Valley, and later into the fertile highlands of S√£o Paulo. In 1860 Brazil had only of railroads; by 1885 this total had increased to . The main rail link between S√£o Paulo's eastern highlands and the ocean port of Santos allowed for a rapid expansion of coffee into the center and northwest of the state. After the initial coffee expansion, the availability of slaves dwindled, and further cultivation required additional slaves. However, by 1840 Brazil was already under pressure to abolish slavery, and a series of decrees were introduced, making it increasingly difficult to supply the new coffee areas with servile labor. In the 1870s, the shortage of labor became critical, leading to the gradual incorporation of free immigrant labor. The coffee expansion in the west-northwest of S√£o Paulo State after 1880 was made possible largely by immigrant labor. In 1880 S√£o Paulo produced 1.2 million 60-kilogram coffee bags, or 25% of Brazil's total; by 1888 this proportion had jumped to 40% (2.6 million bags); and by 1902, to 60% (8 million bags). In turn, between 1884 and 1890 some 201,000 immigrants had entered S√£o Paulo State, and this total jumped to more than 733,000 between 1891 and 1900. Slavery was abolished in 1888. The Brazilian economy grew considerably in the second half of the nineteenth century. Coffee was the mainstay of the economy, accounting for 63% of the country's exports in 1891, and 51% between 1901 and 1910. However, sugar, cotton, tobacco, cocoa, and, during the turn-of-the- century rubber boom, rubber were also important. During the first three decades of the 20th century, the Brazilian economy went through periods of growth but also difficulties caused in part by World War I, the Great Depression, and an increasing trend toward coffee overproduction. The four- year gap between the time a coffee tree is planted and the time of the first harvest magnified cyclical fluctuations in coffee prices, which in turn led to the increasing use of government price supports during periods of excess production. The price supports induced an exaggerated expansion of coffee cultivation in S√£o Paulo, culminating in the huge overproduction of the early 1930s. The 1840 to 1930 period also saw an appreciable but irregular expansion of light industries, notably textiles, clothing, food products, beverages, and tobacco. This expansion was induced by the growth in income, by the availability of foreign exchange, by fiscal policies, and by external events, such as World War I. Other important factors were the expansion of transportation, the installed capacity of electric energy, increased urbanization, and the formation of a dynamic entrepreneurial class. However, the manufacturing growth of the period did not generate significant structural transformations. Economic growth in the nineteenth century was not shared equally by the regions. Development and growth were concentrated in the Southeast. The South Region also achieved considerable development based on coffee and other agricultural products. The Amazon Basin experienced a meteoric rise and fall of incomes from rubber exports. The Northeast continued to stagnate, with its population living close to the subsistence level. Sweeping changes (1930‚Äì1945) The decade of the 1930s was a period of interrelated political and economic changes. The decade started with the 1930 revolution, which abolished the Old Republic (1889‚Äì1930), a federation of semi-autonomous states. After a transitional period in which centralizing elements struggled with the old oligarchies for control, a coup in 1937 established the New State (Estado Novo) dictatorship (1937‚Äì45). To a large extent, the revolution of 1930 reflected a dissatisfaction with the political control exercised by the old oligarchies. The political unrest of the first half of the 1930s and the 1937 coup were influenced strongly by the onset of economic problems in 1930. The coffee economy suffered from a severe decline in world demand caused by the Great Depression and an excess capacity of coffee production created in the 1920s. As a result, the price of coffee fell sharply and remained at very low levels. Brazil's terms of trade deteriorated significantly. These events, and a large foreign debt, led to an external crisis that took almost a decade to resolve. The external difficulties had far-reaching consequences. The government was forced to suspend part of the country's debt payments and eventually to impose exchange controls. Excess coffee production led to increasing interventions in the coffee market. The state programs to support coffee prices went bankrupt in 1930. To avoid further decreases in coffee prices, the central government bought huge amounts of coffee, which was then destroyed. Central government intervention provided support to the coffee sector and, through its linkages, to the rest of the economy. Despite the economic difficulties, the income maintenance scheme of the coffee support program, coupled with the implicit protection provided by the external crisis, was responsible for greater industrial growth. Initially, this growth was based on increased use of the productive capacity and later on moderate spurts of investment. The initial import substitution industrialization that occurred especially during World War I did not lead to industrialization; it became a process of industrialization only in the 1930s. The 1930s also saw a change in the role of government. Until then, the state acted primarily in response to the demands of the export sector. During the first half of the decade, it was forced to interfere swiftly in an attempt to control the external crisis and to avoid the collapse of the coffee economy; government leaders hoped that the crisis would pass soon and that another export boom would occur. However, with the magnitude and duration of the crisis it became clear that Brazil could no longer rely solely on exports of primary goods and that it was necessary to promote economic diversification. During the Estado Novo, the government made initial attempts at economic planning, and in the late 1930s began to establish the first large government enterprise, an integrated steel mill, Companhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional. The World War II period saw mixed achievements. By the late 1930s, coffee production capacity had been reduced drastically, the worst of the external crisis had passed, and the Brazilian economy was ready to grow. However, the war interfered with development efforts. Output increased mainly through better utilization of the existing capacity but, except for the steel mill, there was little industrial and infrastructure investment. Thus, at the end of the war Brazil's industrial capacity was obsolete and the transportation infrastructure was inadequate and badly deteriorated.  Import substitution industrialization (1945‚Äì1964)  A review of the evolution and structural changes of the industrial sector since the end of World War II reveals four broad periods. The postwar period to 1962 was a phase of intense import substitution, especially of consumer goods, with basic industries growing at significant but lower rates. The 1968 to 1973 period was one of very rapid industrial expansion and modernization (between 1962 and 1967, the industrial sector stagnated as a result of adverse macroeconomic conditions). The 1974 to 1985 phase was highlighted by import substitution of basic inputs and capital goods and by the expansion of manufactured goods exports. The period since 1987 has been a time of considerable difficulties. At the end of World War II, political and economic liberalism were reintroduced in Brazil. Get√∫lio Dorneles Vargas (president, 1930‚Äì45, 1951‚Äì54) was overthrown, democratic rule was reestablished, and the foreign-exchange reserves accumulated during the war made possible a reduction of trade restrictions. However, trade liberalization was short-lived. The overvalued foreign-exchange rate, established in 1945, remained fixed until 1953. This, combined with persistent inflation and a repressed demand, meant sharp increases in imports and a sluggish performance of exports, which soon led again to a balance of payments crisis. Pessimistic about the future of Brazil's exports, the government feared that the crisis would have a negative impact on inflation. Consequently, instead of devaluing the cruzeiro, it decided to deal with the crisis through exchange controls. In 1951 the newly elected government of Get√∫lio Vargas enforced a recently established system of import licensing, giving priority to imports of essential goods and inputs (fuels and machinery) and discouraging imports of consumer goods. These policies had the unanticipated effect of providing protection to the consumer goods industry. Early in the 1950s, however, convinced that the only hope for rapid growth was to change the structure of the Brazilian economy, the government adopted an explicit policy of import substitution industrialization. An important instrument of this policy was the use of foreign exchange controls to protect selected segments of domestic industry and to facilitate the importation of equipment and inputs for them. However, the move to fixed exchange rates together with import licensing drastically curtailed exports, and the balance of payments problem became acute. The system became nearly unmanageable, and in 1953 a more flexible, multiple-exchange-rate system was introduced. Under the latter, imports considered essential were brought in at a favored rate; imports of goods that could be supplied domestically faced high rates and were allotted small portions of the available foreign exchange. Similarly, some exports were stimulated with a higher exchange rate than those of traditional exports. This system continued to be the main instrument for the promotion of import substitution industrialization, but the performance of the export sector improved only modestly. Between 1957 and 1961, the government made several changes in the exchange-control system, most of which were attempts at reducing its awkwardness or at improving its performance with the advance of import substitution industrialization. For this same purpose, the government also introduced several complementary measures, including enacting the Tariff Law of 1957, increasing and solidifying the protection extended to domestic industries, and offering strong inducements to direct foreign investment. In the second half of the 1950s, the government enacted a series of special programs intended to better orient the industrialization process, to remove bottlenecks, and to promote vertical integration in certain industries. The government gave special attention to industries considered basic for growth, notably the automotive, cement, steel, aluminum, cellulose, heavy machinery, and chemical industries. As a result of import substitution industrialization, the Brazilian economy experienced rapid growth and considerable diversification. Between 1950 and 1961, the average annual rate of growth of the gross domestic product exceeded 7%. Industry was the engine of growth. It had an average annual growth rate of over 9 percent between 1950 and 1961, compared with 4.5% for agriculture. In addition, the structure of the manufacturing sector experienced considerable change. Traditional industries, such as textiles, food products, and clothing, declined, while the transport equipment, machinery, electric equipment and appliances, and chemical industries expanded. However, the strategy also left a legacy of problems and distortions. The growth it promoted resulted in a substantial increase in imports, notably of inputs and machinery, and the foreign-exchange policies of the period meant inadequate export growth. Moreover, a large influx of foreign capital in the 1950s resulted in a large foreign debt. Import substitution industrialization can be assessed according to the contribution to value added by four main industrial subsectors: nondurable consumer goods, durable consumer goods, intermediate goods, and capital goods. Using data from the industrial censuses, the share of these groups in value added between 1949 and 1960 shows a considerable decline in the share of the nondurable goods industries, from nearly 60 percent to less than 43 percent, and a sharp increase in that of durable goods, from nearly 6% to more than 18%. The intermediate and capital goods groups experienced moderate increases, from 32 to 36% and from 2.2 to 3.2%, respectively. A representative component of the nondurable group is the textile industry, the leading sector before World War II. Between 1949 and 1960, its share in the value added by industry as a whole experienced a sharp decline, from 20.1% to 11.6%. In the durable goods group, the component with the most significant change was the transport equipment sector (automobiles and trucks), which increased from 2.3% to 10.5%. The lower increases in the shares of the intermediate and capital goods industries reflect the lesser priority attributed to them by the import substitution industrialization strategy. In the early 1960s, Brazil already had a fairly diversified industrial structure, but one in which vertical integration was only beginning. Thus, instead of alleviating the balance of payments problems, import substitution increased them dramatically.  Stagnation and spectacular growth (1962‚Äì1980)  =Stagnation (1962‚Äì1967)= As a result of the problems associated with import substitution industrialization and the reforms introduced by the military regime after March 1964, the Brazilian economy lost much of its dynamism between 1962 and 1967. The average rate of growth of GDP in the period declined to 4.0 percent and that of industry to 3.9 percent. In part, stagnation resulted from distortions caused by the strategy. Moreover, political troubles negatively affected expectations fac and precluded the formation of a coalition to back the introduction of tough measures to control inflation and the balance of payments crisis. Political troubles also hindered the removal of obstacles to growth. The 1964 coup dealt with the political obstacles by forcefully restraining opposition to the military agenda of change. With the objective of transforming Brazil into a modern capitalist economy and a military power, the regime implemented a series of reforms aimed at reducing inflation, at removing some of the distortions of import substitution industrialization, and at modernizing capital markets. The regime gradually introduced incentives to direct investment, domestic and foreign, and tackled balance of payments problems by reforming and simplifying the foreign-exchange system. In addition, the regime introduced a mechanism of periodic devaluations of the cruzeiro, taking into account inflation. Finally, the military government adopted measures to attract foreign capital and to promote exports. It took steps to expand public investment to improve the country's infrastructure and later to develop state-owned basic industries. =Spectacular growth (1968‚Äì1973)= The post-1964 reforms and other policies of the military government, together with the state of the world economy, created conditions for very rapid growth between 1968 and 1973. In that period, the average annual rate of growth of GDP jumped to 11.1%, led by industry with a 13.1% average. Within industry, the leading sectors were consumer durables, transportation equipment, and basic industries, such as steel, cement, and electricity generation. As a result of the post-1964 policies, external trade expanded substantially faster than the economy as a whole. There was a significant growth in exports, especially manufactured goods, but also commodities. Yet, imports grew considerably faster, rapidly increasing the trade deficit. This did not present a problem, however, because massive inflows of capital resulted in balance of payments surpluses. The external sector contributed substantially to high growth rates, as did the rapid expansion of investment, including a growing share of public investment and investment by state-controlled enterprises. In addition, increased demand for automobiles, durable and luxury goods, and housing resulted from a rapid growth in income for the upper income strata and from credit plans created for consumers and home-buyers by the capital-market reforms. The industrial sector generally experienced not only rapid growth but also considerable modernization. As a result, imports of capital goods and basic and semi- processed inputs increased sharply. The share of intermediate goods imports in total imports increased from 31.0% in the 1960‚Äì62 period to 42.7% in 1972, and that of capital goods, from 29.0 to 42.2%. The total value of imports rose from US$1.3 billion to US$4.4 billion. A comparison of the 1960 and the 1975 shares of the various industrial sectors in total value added by industry reveals a continuation in the relative decline of nondurable industries, notably textiles, food products, and beverages, and an increase in machinery, from 3.2 to 10.3%. The relative shares of most of the remaining industries, however, did not change significantly in the period. As a result of the period's outward-looking development strategy, Brazil's industrial exports increased from US$1.4 billion in 1963 to US$6.2 billion in 1973. The composition of exports shows that whereas in 1963 processed and semi-processed manufactured exports accounted for only 5% of total exports, in 1974 their share had reached 29%. In the 1968‚Äì73 period, personal income became more concentrated and regional disparities became greater. Industrial expansion took place more vigorously in the Center-South Region, which had benefited most from the import substitution industrialization strategy. Its per-capita income considerably exceeded the national average, its infrastructure was more developed, and it had an adequate supply of skilled workers and professionals. The region was therefore able to take advantage of the opportunities and incentives offered by the military regime. Although a special regional development strategy existed for the Northeast, it promoted a distorted industrialization that benefited only a few of that region's large cities; the Northeast's linkages with the Center-South were stronger than its linkages within the region. The combination of a harsh climate, a highly concentrated land-tenure system, and an elite that consistently resisted meaningful change prevented the Northeast from developing effectively. = Growth with debt (1974‚Äì1980) = Economic activity in Brazil (1977) Brazil suffered drastic reductions in its terms of trade as a result of the 1973 oil shock. In the early 1970s, the performance of the export sector was undermined by an overvalued currency. With the trade balance under pressure, the oil shock led to a sharply higher import bill. Brazil opted to continue a high-growth policy. Furthermore, it adopted renewed strategies of import substitution industrialization and of economic diversification. In the mid-1970s, the regime began implementing a development plan aimed at increasing self- sufficiency in many sectors and creating new comparative advantages. Its main components were to promote import substitution of basic industrial inputs (steel, aluminium, fertilizers, petrochemicals), to make large investments in the expansion of the economic infrastructure, and to promote exports. This strategy was effective in promoting growth, but it also raised Brazil's import requirements markedly, increasing the already large current-account deficit. The current account was financed by running up the foreign debt. The expectation was that the combined effects of import substitution industrialization and export expansion eventually would bring about growing trade surpluses, allowing the service and repayment of the foreign debt. Thus, despite the world recession resulting from other countries' adjustments to the oil shock, Brazil was able to maintain a high growth rate. Between 1974 and 1980, the average annual rate of growth of real GDP reached 6.9 percent and that of industry, 7.2 percent. However, the current-account deficit increased from US$1.7 billion in 1973 to US$12.8 billion in 1980. The foreign debt rose from US$6.4 billion in 1963 to nearly US$54 billion in 1980. Brazil was able to raise its foreign debt because, at the time, the international financial system was awash in petrodollars and was eagerly offering low-interest loans. By the end of the 1970s, however, the foreign debt had reached high levels. Additionally, the marked increase of international interest rates raised the debt service, forcing the country to borrow more only to meet interest payments. Productive capacity, exports, and the substitution of imports in various sectors expanded and became more diversified. However, the expected impacts on Brazil's current account were not to materialize until the mid-1980s. Another feature of the 1974‚Äì80 period was an acceleration of inflation. Between 1968 and 1974, the rate of inflation had declined steadily, but afterward the trend was reversed. From 16.2 percent a year in 1973, the growth rate of the general price index increased to 110.2 percent a year by 1980. Stagnation, inflation and crisis (1981‚Äì1993) The effect of the 1974‚Äì85 period's industrialization on the balance of trade was significant. The balance of trade moved from an average deficit of US$3.4 billion in the 1974‚Äì76 period to an average surplus of US$10.7 billion in the 1983‚Äì85 period. In 1985 the share of manufactures (processed and semi-processed) of total exports reached 66 percent, and between 1971‚Äì75 and 1978‚Äì83 the share of basic input imports in total imports declined from 32.3% to 19.2%. The recession and stagnation of the early 1980s had a role in reducing imports. However, import substitution was also important, as demonstrated by the few years of the 1980s that experienced a significant growth in GDP while the trade surplus was maintained. Between 1981 and 1992, the GDP increased at an average annual rate of only 2.9% and per capita income declined 6%. Gross investment, as a proportion of GDP, fell from 21 to 16 percent, in part as a result of the fiscal crisis and the loss of public-sector investment capacity. The decline also reflected growing uncertainties regarding the future of the economy. The 1980s became known as the \\"lost decade,\\" and its problems spilled over into the 1990s. Despite the stagnation of the 1981‚Äì92 period, inflation remained a major problem (see stagflation). It stayed in the 100% level until the mid-80's and then grew to more than 1000% a year, reaching a record 5000% in 1993. =1981‚Äì1984= In 1979 a second oil shock nearly doubled the price of imported oil to Brazil and lowered the terms of trade further. The rise in world interest rates sharply increased Brazil's balance of payments problem and the size of the foreign debt. Nevertheless, the government continued borrowing, mainly to face an increasing debt burden, while it tried vainly to maintain the high-growth strategy. At the beginning of the 1980s, however, the foreign-debt problem became acute, leading to the introduction of a program to generate growing trade surpluses in order to service the foreign debt. The program was achieved by reducing growth and, with it, imports, and by expanding exports. As a result, in 1981 real GDP declined by 4.4 percent. The 1982 Mexican debt crisis ended Brazil's access to international financial markets, increasing the pressure for economic adjustment. Some unorthodox economists like Stephen Kanitz attribute the debt crisis not to the high Brazilian level of indebtedness nor to the disorganization of the country's economy. They say that the cause of the crisis was rather a minor error in the U.S. government banking regulations which forbids its banks from lending over ten times the amount of their capital, a regulation that, when the inflation eroded their lending limits, forced them to cut the access of underdeveloped countries to international savings. The austerity program imposed by the International Monetary Fund in late 1979 continued until 1984, but substantial trade surpluses were obtained only from 1983 on, largely as a delayed result of the import substitution industrialization programs of the 1970s and the reduction in imports brought about by economic decline. The austerity program enabled Brazil to meet interest payments on the debt, but at the price of economic decline and increasing inflation. Inflation accelerated as a result of a combination of factors: the exchange-rate devaluations of the austerity program, a growing public deficit, and an increasing indexation of financial balances, wages, and other values for inflation. The first two factors are classical causes of inflation; the last became an important mechanism for propagating hyperinflation and in preventing the usual instruments of inflation control from operating. By the mid-1980s, domestic debt nearly displaced foreign debt as Brazil's main economic problem. During the high- growth 1970s, a significant portion of foreign borrowing had been by state enterprises, which were the main actors in the import substitution industrialization strategy. Initially, they borrowed to finance their investments. However, toward the end of the decade, with the acute shortage of foreign exchange, the government forced state enterprises to borrow unnecessarily, increasing their indebtedness markedly. Their situation worsened with the sharp rise in international interest rates in the late 1970s, the devaluations of the austerity program, and the decreasing real prices of goods and services provided by the public enterprises stemming from price controls. Because the state enterprises were not allowed to go bankrupt, their debt burden was transferred gradually to the government, further increasing the public debt. This, and a growing disorganization of the public sector, transformed the public debt into a major economic problem. By the mid-1980s, the financial burden stemming from the debt was contributing decisively to its rapid expansion. = 1985‚Äì1989 = During the second half of the 1980s, it became increasingly clear that a large-scale fiscal reform, one that enabled noninflationary financing of the public sector, was needed not only to control inflation but also to restore the public sector's capacity to invest. Both were essential for an economic recovery. However, political obstacles prevented the reform from materializing. And, because inflation had become the most visible symptom of the public-sector disequilibrium, there were several attempts to bring inflation under control through what came to be known as \\"heterodox economic shocks\\". The period saw three such shocks: the Cruzado Plan (1986), the Bresser Plan (1987), and the Summer Plan (1989). The objective of the Cruzado Plan was to eliminate inflation with a dramatic blow. Between 1980 and 1985, the rise in the CPI had escalated from 86.3% to 248.5% annually. Early in 1986, the situation became desperate, prodding the implementation of the plan. Its main measures were a general price freeze, a wage readjustment and freeze, readjustment and freeze on rents and mortgage payments, a ban on indexation, and a freeze on the exchange rate. The plan's immediate results were spectacular: the monthly rate of inflation fell close to zero, economic growth surged upward, and the foreign accounts remained under control. However, by the end of 1986 the plan was in trouble. The wage adjustments were too large, increasing aggregate demand excessively and creating inflationary pressures. Moreover, the price freeze was maintained for too long, creating distortions and leading to shortages of a growing number of products. Inflation accelerated again and there was a return of indexation. The country imposed a moratorium on its foreign debt service on February 20, 1987. The two other stabilization plans amounted to renewed attempts at bringing inflation down from very high levels. It was soon clear that without a thorough reform of the public sector, controlling inflation would be impossible. Both plans introduced a price freeze and eliminated indexation, but there were differences between them, and with the Cruzado Plan. Neither was able to address the public-sector disequilibrium effectively. The objective of the Summer Plan, for instance, was mainly to avoid hyperinflation in an election year. In fact, the public-sector disequilibrium became virtually locked in as a result of the 1988 constitution, which created advantages for various segments of society without indicating how these advantages would be paid for. Moreover, it transferred large portions of the tax revenues from the federal government to state and municipal governments, without requiring them to provide additional public services. With less revenue and more responsibility, the federal accounts experienced growing deficits. In addition, several subsidies were locked into the legislation. These factors and the financial burden of the public debt meant growing problems of public finance. The 1980s ended with high and accelerating inflation and a stagnant economy, which never recovered after the demise of the Cruzado Plan. The public debt was enormous, and the government was required to pay very high interest rates to persuade the public to continue to buy government debt instruments. Another major obstacle to economic growth during the 1980s was Brazil's protectionist policy from 1984 to 1992 of severely restricting imports of foreign computer hardware and software to protect and nurture Brazil's domestic computer industry (which was but one manifestation of the country's long-term policy of import substitution industrialization). The policy was so strict that the government regularly seized personal computers from foreign businesspersons who were visiting for ordinary business trips, because of the fear that foreign visitors were smuggling PCs to domestic users. Although this policy was superficially successful, the federal government failed to fund the basic research that was essential to the success of computer industries in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Brazilian computer users in this era frequently paid two or three times the international market price for unreliable, poorly designed domestic clones of foreign computer designs, since domestic manufacturers lacked the well-trained engineers and basic research necessary to develop their own indigenous innovations, let alone build brilliant new designs from scratch. By the time the policy was rescinded in 1991, it had failed in the sense that Brazil's domestic computer manufacturers were still unable to make advanced computer products suitable for export to other countries, and had severely limited the modernization and computerization of Brazil's economy. By that point, computer usage in most economic sectors in most developed countries was exceeding 90 percent. In Brazil, computer usage by businesses was around 12 percent. In other words, by 1990, the electronic office was still science fiction as far as most Brazilians were concerned and they were still doing business exclusively through labor-intensive paper-based processes. This meant their productivity was far lower than people in countries who had already been using computers for one or two decades, and who had, for example, already made the transition from typing and re-typing drafts of documents on manual typewriters to simply entering print commands into word processing software. Finally, the policy of restricting imports of foreign computers was also blamed for causing Brazil to fall far behind in adopting many lifesaving technologies made possible by modern microprocessors, such as anti-lock brakes. The first post-military-regime president elected by popular suffrage, Fernando Collor de Mello (1990‚Äì92), was sworn into office in March 1990. Facing imminent hyperinflation and a virtually bankrupt public sector, the new administration introduced a stabilization plan, together with a set of reforms, aimed at removing restrictions on free enterprise, increasing competition, privatizing public enterprises, and boosting productivity. Heralded as a definitive blow to inflation, the stabilization plan was drastic. It imposed an eighteen-month freeze on all but a small portion of the private sector's financial assets, froze prices, and again abolished indexation. The new administration also introduced provisional taxes to deal with the fiscal crisis, and took steps to reform the public sector by closing several public agencies and dismissing public servants. Collor also implemented a radical liquidity freeze, reducing the money stock by 80% by freezing bank accounts in excess of $1000. These measures were expected not only to swiftly reduce inflation but also to lower inflationary expectations. = 1990‚Äì1993 = Brazil adopted neoliberalism in the late 1980s, with support from the workers party on the left. Brazil ended the old policy of closed economies with development focused through import substitution industrialization, in favor of a much for your economic system, and massive privatization. For example, tariff rates were cut from 32 percent in 1990 to 14 percent in 1994. The market reforms and trade reforms resulted in price stability and faster inflow of capital, but did not change I levels of income inequality and poverty. Edmund Amann, and Werner Baer, \\"Neoliberalism and its consequences in Brazil.\\" Journal of Latin American Studies 34.4 (2002): 945-959. Online At first few of the new administration's programs succeeded. Major difficulties with the stabilization and reform programs were caused in part by the superficial nature of many of the administration's actions and by its inability to secure political support. Moreover, the stabilization plan failed because of management errors coupled with defensive actions by segments of society that would be most directly hurt by the plan. Confidence in the government was also eroded as a result of the liquidity freeze combined with an alienated industrial sector who had not been consulted in the plan. After falling more than 80 percent in March 1990, the CPI's monthly rate of growth began increasing again. The best that could be achieved was to stabilize the CPI at a high and slowly rising level. In January 1991, it rose by 19.9%, reaching 32% a month by July 1993. Simultaneously, political instability increased sharply, with negative impacts on the economy. The real GDP declined 4.0% in 1990, increased only 1.1% in 1991, and again declined 0.9% in 1992. President Collor de Mello was impeached in September 1992 on charges of corruption. Vice president Itamar Franco was sworn in as president (1992‚Äì94), but he had to grapple to form a stable cabinet and to gather political support. The weakness of the interim administration prevented it from tackling inflation effectively. In 1993 the economy grew again, but with inflation rates higher than 30 percent a month, the chances of a durable recovery appeared to be very slim. At the end of the year, it was widely acknowledged that without serious fiscal reform, inflation would remain high and the economy would not sustain growth. This acknowledgment and the pressure of rapidly accelerating inflation finally jolted the government into action. The president appointed a determined minister of finance, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and a high-level team was put in place to develop a new stabilization plan. Implemented early in 1994, the plan met little public resistance because it was discussed widely and it avoided price freezes. The stabilization program, called Plano Real had three stages: the introduction of an equilibrium budget mandated by the National Congress a process of general indexation (prices, wages, taxes, contracts, and financial assets); and the introduction of a new currency, the Brazilian real (pegged to the dollar). The legally enforced balanced budget would remove expectations regarding inflationary behavior by the public sector. By allowing a realignment of relative prices, general indexation would pave the way for monetary reform. Once this realignment was achieved, the new currency would be introduced, accompanied by appropriate policies (especially the control of expenditures through high interest rates and the liberalization of trade to increase competition and thus prevent speculative behavior). By the end of the first quarter of 1994, the second stage of the stabilization plan was being implemented. Economists of different schools of thought considered the plan sound and technically consistent. Post-Real Plan economy (1994‚Äì2010) The Plano Real (\\"Real Plan\\"), instituted in the spring 1994, sought to break inflationary expectations by pegging the real to the US dollar. Inflation was brought down to single digit annual figures, but not fast enough to avoid substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the transition phase of the Plano Real. This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, no shortage of foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of the debt crisis of the 1980s faded. The Real Plan successfully eliminated inflation, after many failed attempts to control it. Almost 25 million people turned into consumers. The maintenance of large current account deficits via financial account surpluses became problematic as investors became more risk averse to emerging market exposure as a consequence of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the Russian bond default in August 1998. After crafting a fiscal adjustment program and pledging progress on structural reform, Brazil received a $41.5 billion IMF- led international support program in November 1998. In January 1999, the Brazilian Central Bank announced that the real would no longer be pegged to the US dollar. This devaluation helped moderate the downturn in economic growth in 1999 that investors had expressed concerns about over the summer of 1998. Brazil's debt-to-GDP ratio of 48% for 1999 beat the IMF target and helped reassure investors that Brazil will maintain tight fiscal and monetary policy even with a floating currency. The economy grew 4.4% in 2000, but problems in Argentina in 2001, and growing concerns that the presidential candidate considered most likely to win, leftist Luis In√°cio Lula da Silva, would default on the debt, triggered a confidence crisis that caused the economy to decelerate. Poverty was down to near 16%. In 2002, Luis In√°cio Lula da Silva won the presidential elections and was re-elected in 2006. During his government, the economy began to grow more rapidly. In 2004, Brazil saw a promising growth of 5.7% in GDP, followed by 2005 with 3.2%, 2006 with 4.0%, 2007 with 6.1% and 2008 with 5.1%. Due to the 2008‚Äì10 world financial crisis, Brazil's economy was expected to slow down in 2009 between a decline of ‚àí0.5% and a growth of 0.0%. In reality, economic growth continued at a high rate hitting 7.5% in 2010. =2010s economic contraction= Following a boom at the end of the previous decade, Brazil's economy experienced a contraction. Between 2011 and 2015, the value of the real fell from 1.55 reals per US dollar to 4.0 reals. The price of many of the country's main exports fell due to falling demand. From September 2014 to February 2015, Petrobras, the largest energy corporation in Brazil, lost 60% of its market value.

For the history of an earlier 1st Infantry Regiment, see 3rd US Infantry The 1st Infantry Regiment is a regiment of the United States Army that draws its lineage from a line of post American Revolutionary War units and is credited with thirty-nine campaign streamers. The 1st Battalion, 1st Infantry is assigned as support to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and to furnish the enlisted garrison for the academy and the Stewart Army Subpost. 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment is an infantry component serving with the 2nd Stryker Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division at Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord, Washington. Origins On March 3, 1791, Congress added to the Army \\"The Second Regiment of Infantry\\" from which today's First Infantry draws its heritage. In September of that year, elements of it and the original 1st Infantry Regiment (today‚Äôs 3rd United States Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)), with sizable militia complements, all under command of General Arthur St. Clair, were sent against the Miami Indians. St. Clair served as a major general in the Continental Army and was now appointed \\"General in Chief,\\" superseding the first commander of the regiment, Josiah Harmar. Fighting against the Miamis, St. Clair's soldiers were untrained, ill-equipped, underfed, and sickly. This resulted in a disastrous defeat, at the Battle of the Wabash, in which the entire U.S. Army suffered a loss in killed and wounded of nearly 900 out of a total strength of 900. Legion of the United States Banks of the Maumee. Anthony Wayne commanded the Army, enlarged in 1792 and was formed into the Legion (now 1st and 3rd Infantry Regiments). The Legion advanced into Indian country and on 20 August 1794 routed Indian forces. In 1792, Congress created the Legion of the United States, which was a combined arms force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery under the command of Major General Anthony Wayne. MG Wayne had become a hero of the Revolutionary War when he led a small force against a larger British force to regain control of Stony Point, a crucial point on the Hudson River just south of West Point, New York. This Legion in which the Second Infantry became the \\"Infantry of the Second Sub-Legion,\\" finally decisively defeated the Northwest Indian confederacy and its British support at Fallen Timbers in the Old Northwest (Ohio Country) on 20 August 1794. War of 1812 In the War of 1812, the 2nd Infantry Regiment as well as the 7th and 44th Infantry Regiments, fought in the southern theater to include the Battle of New Orleans with General Andrew Jackson. This gives the regiment campaign credit for the War of 1812. First Indian War period The 2nd Infantry was consolidated May‚ÄìOctober 1815 with the 3rd and 7th Infantry (both constituted 12 April 1808), and 44th Infantry (constituted 29 January 1813) to form the 1st Infantry Regiment. In the ensuing years the regiment was primarily concerned with Indian conflicts and the 1st was involved in the Black Hawk War of 1832 and the Second Seminole War from 1839 to 1842. During this time the regiment was commanded by many, now famous commanders including, Colonel Zachary Taylor, who would later become the 12th President of the United States and Second Lieutenant Jefferson Davis, who would become the President of the Confederate States in the American Civil War. War with Mexico When War broke out with Mexico in 1846, the 1st Infantry Regiment was sent across the border with General Zachary Taylor's Army and participated in the storming of Monterrey where the regiment fought house to house in savage hand-to-hand combat. From Monterrey, the regiment was transferred to General Winfield Scott's command and participated in the first modern amphibious landing in American history at Vera Cruz in 1847. Second Indian War period Following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the regiment campaigned in the Texas area against the Comanches until the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. Civil War After escaping from rebel forces in Texas the regiment returned to the Mid-west and fought in the Mississippi area of operations. The regiment fought in one of the first battles of the Civil War at Wilson's Creek, Missouri, in August 1861. The 1st Infantry then campaigned with General Grant against Vicksburg in 1863. The end of the war found the regiment occupying New Orleans, Louisiana. Third Indian War period After the Civil War the regiment was sent West to fight the Indians once again. The 1st Infantry was consolidated in April 1869 with the 43d Infantry Regiment, Veteran Reserve Corps (constituted 21 September 1865) and consolidated unit designated as the 1st Infantry Regiment. 1st Infantry Regiment campaigned against the Sioux in the 1870s and 1890s and against the Apache, led by Geronimo, from 1882 to 1886. One member of the regiment was awarded the Medal of Honor for service during this period: 1st Lt. Marion P. Maus, 11 January 1886, Sierra Madre Mountains, Mexico. California labor disputes After the end of the Indian wars the regiment was occupied with quelling labor disputes in California. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War War was declared with Spain in 1898 following the sinking of the USS Maine. The First was quickly sent to Florida where it embarked on ships and was sent to Cuba. While in Cuba the regiment took part in the storming of the San Juan Heights and the capture of Santiago. Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War In 1900, following occupation duty in Cuba, the regiment was preparing for shipment to China to participate in the Boxer Rebellion. Instead, the regiment was detoured to deal with the rebellion on the Philippine Islands which had also been captured by the United States in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The regiment would fight in this guerrilla war in the Philippines from 1900‚Äì1902 and again from 1906‚Äì1908. Subsequently, the regiment was redeployed to garrison duties in Oahu, Hawaii. World War I 1st Infantry Regiment was assigned on 11 September 1918 to the 13th Division at Fort Lewis. 13th ID never left Fort Lewis, and demobilized there on 8 March 1919. 1st IR was relieved on 8 March 1919 from assignment to the 13th Division and resumed separate regiment status. The regiment was again assigned 27 July 1921, this time to the 2nd Division, which was headquartered at Fort Sam Houston, and assigned to the U.S. VIII Corps. World War II The regiment was stationed at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, where it was relieved 16 October 1939 from assignment to the 2nd Division and assigned to the 6th Division. The 6th Division arrived at Fort Jackson on 1939-11-09, and the 1st IR traveled with the division from that point forward. The 1st IR moved to Fort Benning, Georgia on 1940-04-09 to prepare for a series of maneuvers. The 1st IR participated in the Sabine, Louisiana ‚Äì Texas Maneuver on 1940-05-09. They then moved to Fort Francis E. Warren, Wyoming on 1940-06-03, and then to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas on 1941-04-02, followed by Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri on 1941-05-20. They then moved to Tennessee to participate in maneuvers there. This was followed by a training cycle at the Desert Training Center, while billeted at the Camp Young billeting area from 1942-12-10. The regiment then staged at Camp San Luis Obispo, California on 1943-03-23. The regiment departed from the San Francisco, California Port of Embarkation on 1943-09-19, and arrived in Hawaii on 1943-09-26. The 1st IR departed Hawaii on 1944-01-26, and arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea on 1944-02-07 to participate in the New Guinea Campaign. 1st IR departed Milne Bay on 1944-06-01, and arrived at Toem on 1944-06-14. 1st IR assaulted Sansapor on 1944-07-30, and left New Guinea on 1944-12-26 with the end of the New Guinea Campaign taking place on 1944-12-31. The 1st IR won a Presidential Unit Citation for its action at Milne Bay. 1st IR assaulted Lingayen Gulf on the Philippine Island of Luzon on 1945-01-09 to participate in the Luzon Campaign. 1st IR moved to Sixth Army Reserve status from 1945-02-10 to 1945-02-23, when they returned to the Luzon Campaign. 1st IR attached to 38th Infantry Division from 1945-04-28 to 1945-05-01, and then was attached to the XI Corps from 1945-06-10 to 1945-06-25, when they returned to 6th Infantry Division Control. The Luzon Campaign concluded on 1945-07-04. 1st IR was located at Bagabag, Philippine Islands on 1945-08-14. They then moved to Korea on 1945-10-24, which they Occupied through 1949, with garrisons in Taegu and Pusan. Korean War and reactivation On 10 January 1949, 1st IR was inactivated in Korea, and then was reactivated on 4 October 1950 at Fort Ord, California as a training regiment for units being sent to the fight in Korea. On 3 April 1956, the regiment was relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division, and then was assigned on 15 May 1956 to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. On 15 May 1958 the regiment was reorganized under the Combat Arms Regimental System as HHC, 1st Battle Group, 1st Infantry Regiment. In 1960, the 1st Battle Group, 1st Infantry was reorganized under a concept that provided sufficient tactics instructors in the permanent party for continuity, but called for outside augmentation for the summer training program. This left the battle group with a Headquarters, Headquarters and Training Company, Service Company, Airborne Detachment, the 2nd Aviation Detachment, the USMA Band, Detachment 1 and 2 United States Army Hospital, and saw the attachment of the 50th Engineer Battalion (Construction) and the 57th Military Police Company. The old Military Police Detachment personnel formed the nucleus of the newly attached 57th Military Police Company. On 16 May 1961, the mission of providing tactical instruction for the Corps of Cadets along with the personnel involved, was transferred to a newly created Office of Military Instruction in the Department of Tactics. All enlisted personnel remained assigned to the battle group. On 1 February 1962, Service Company was eliminated and its personnel absorbed into Headquarters Company. On 1 January 1965, the 1st Battle Group, 1st Infantry was redesigned as the 1st Battalion, 1st Infantry. With the exception of transferring tactical instruction to the Office of Military Instruction (now DMI) in 1961, its mission was essentially unchanged. The 2nd Battalion was then assigned to Fort Benning, Georgia. Vietnam War In 1966, the 2nd Battalion was deployed to Vietnam with the 196th Light Infantry Brigade. The following year, the 3rd Battalion was activated at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade. After the 11th Brigade arrived in Vietnam, both battalions became components of the Americal Division. These two battalions earned fourteen campaign streamers for the regiment during the war in Vietnam. Also in 1967, the 4th, 5th, and 6th Battalions were activated on 24 November and assigned to the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The battalions at Fort Campbell were relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division on 24 July 1968, and inactivated on 21 July 1969. The 11th Infantry Brigade returned home in 1971, at which time 3rd Battalion was deactivated. The 196th Infantry Brigade was the last combat brigade to leave Vietnam in June 1972. Following its tour of duty in Vietnam the 2nd Battalion was sent to Fort Lewis, Washington, where it became part of the 9th Infantry Division. In January 1991 the battalion became part of the 199th Infantry Brigade at Fort Polk, Louisiana, where it remained until inactivation in 1994. 1st Infantry soldiers awarded the Medal of Honor for service in Vietnam: * Specialist Four Thomas J. McMahon, Company A, 2nd Battalion, 19 January 1969, Quang Tin Province (posthumous) * Specialist Four Donald Sloat, 3rd Platoon, Delta Company, 2nd Battalion, 17 January 1970, Qu·∫£ng Nam Province (posthumous) * Private First Class David F. Winder, HQ & HQ Company, 3rd Battalion, 13 May 1970 (posthumous) Reactivation On 16 December 1994 the 2nd Battalion was reactivated at Fort Wainwright as part of the 6th Infantry Division (Light), which was reduced in size and reflagged as the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) in April 1998. Iraq War In August 2005 2nd Battalion was deployed, along with the 172nd Stryker Brigade, to Mosul Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion conducted counter insurgency operations aimed at securing the city of Mosul from an insurgency headed by the terrorist organization al-Qaeda in Iraq. After 12 months in Mosul 2nd Battalion was preparing to return to home station at Fort Wainwright, Alaska when their deployment was unexpectedly extended by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The 2nd Battalion, along with the entire 172nd Infantry Brigade, was subsequently sent to Baghdad, Iraq to quell rising sectarian violence. The 2nd Battalion returned home in December 2006 after 16 months in Iraq. It was inactivated on 16 December when the 172nd was reflagged as the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, and the 2-1st Infantry was reflagged as the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry.1st Brigade, 25th Infantry Division Homepage: Units . 25th Infantry Division Staff. Retrieved 27 June 2008. =Notable awards / commendations= Corporal (R) Stephen Sanford, Company C, 2nd Battalion, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in Mosul Iraq during the unit's deployment. Sergeant First Class Peter Lara, Company C, 2nd Battalion, was awarded the Silver Star for actions in Mosul Iraq during the unit's deployment. War in Afghanistan The battalion was reactivated on 17 April 2007 as part of the 5th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis. On 17 February 2009, President Obama ordered 4,000 soldiers of 5th Stryker Brigade Combat Team to Afghanistan, along with 8,000 Marines. The deployment came as a result of the then-worsening situation in the Afghan war. These soldiers were to be deployed in the southeast, on the Afghan border. The brigade was scheduled to return to Joint Base Lewis‚ÄìMcChord in July 2010. After it returned, on 22 July, the 5th BCT was reflagged as the 2nd BCT of the 2nd ID and the battalion continued to serve with the latter.

It was published in June 2005, concurrently released on the Internet under a Creative Commons license, free for download in several formats including ASCII and PDF. It is Doctorow's third novel. The novel was chosen to launch the Sci Fi Channel's book club, Sci Fi Essentials (now defunct). Plot summary The story mainly takes place in two Ontario locales. In flashbacks, the main character, usually but not always called Alan (he appears to have been alphabetized rather than named, and will answer to any masculine name beginning with A), and his brothers (also alphabetized) grow up outside of the remote town of Kapuskasing. The novel opens with Alan's purchase of a home in the Kensington Market neighborhood of modern-day Toronto. There are two main plotlines. Alan befriends Kurt, a thirty-something punk who operates a dumpster-diving operation. Kurt uses computer components that he retrieves from the trash and turns them into Wi-Fi network access points. Kurt's goal is to blanket the entire neighborhood with free and secure Internet access by attaching his access points to buildings in a wireless mesh network with the permission of their owners. Kurt's plan doesn't really get off the ground until he forms a partnership with Alan, who puts a more professional face on the operation and sweet-talks many local owners into allowing the access points to use their space and a small amount of their electricity. The second plotline features fantasy elements. Unbeknownst to most of the other characters, Alan and his brothers are not quite human. Their father is a mountain and their mother is a washing machine. Alan's eldest brother can see the future, his second-eldest is an island, his younger brother is undead, and his three youngest brothers are a set of Russian nesting dolls. Alan is the most normal-seeming of his family. Outwardly, he looks human, but he heals at an incredible rate, and if part of him is cut off, it will grow back, and the cut off part can be made to form a new copy of him, much like an earthworm does. Another plot strand concerns Alan's neighbors, a household of students and artists which includes Mimi, a troubled young woman who like Alan is not quite human. Born with wings on her back and no family history, she lives with her abusive boyfriend Krishna, a musician/bartender who can spot beings like Alan and his family, and hates them. Krishna amputates Mimi's wings every three months; she stays with him because she believes he's the only one willing and able to make her \\"normal.\\" Characters Alan, the main character, is called by several names that start with \\"A\\", such as Adam and Abby. His brothers' names follow the same pattern, from \\"B\\" through \\"G\\" for the seventh and youngest brother. No name is given for their parents other than \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\". Alan is largely known as \\"Alan\\" in the narrator's voice, though rarely in any character's voice. Only in a few places does the narrator call Alan by another name. Alan's neighbors' first names also follow an alphabetic sequence: Krishna, Link, Mimi, and Natalie. Mimi is merely a name that she is called, described as being \\"as good as any other\\". There are repeat uses of some of these letters, namely Kurt, Lyman, and Marci. (An O and a P name are also briefly mentioned). There are also six anarchists collectively known as Waldo. Almost everyone is known by their first name only. A good number of people are nameless, described by some physical characteristic instead.

It is known to occur in humans, dogs, cats, horses, and chinchillas. Clinically, these opacities are quite refractile, giving the appearance of stars (or asteroids) shining in the night sky‚Äîexcept that ocular asteroids are often quite mobile. Ocular asteroids must be distinguished from the more common typical vitreous floaters, which are usually fibrillar or cellular condensates. The cause of asteroid hyalosis is unknown, but it has been associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and, in certain animals, tumors of the ciliary body. In dogs, asteroid hyalosis is considered to be an age related change. The asteroid bodies are made up of hydroxylapatite, which in turn consists of calcium and phosphates or phospholipids. While asteroid hyalosis does not usually severely affect vision, the floating opacities can be quite annoying, and may interfere significantly with visualization and testing of the retina. While treatment of asteroid hyalosis is usually unnecessary, vitrectomy may occasionally be indicated, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Harris began writing the book during what he described as a period of \\"collective grief and stupefaction\\" following the September 11, 2001 attacks.Adler, Jerry. \\"The New Naysayers\\", Newsweek, 2006. The book comprises a general critique of all religious belief. The book was published August 11, 2004, and it was awarded the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction the following year.PEN American Center, 2005. \\"The PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction .\\" The paperback edition was published in October 2005. In the same month it entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number four, and remained on the list for a total of 33 weeks.Sunday Book Review, 2005-07. New York Times. In response to criticism and feedback regarding The End of Faith, Harris wrote Letter to a Christian Nation two years later. Synopsis The End of Faith opens with a literary account of a day in the life of a suicide bomber - his last day. In an introductory chapter, Harris calls for an end to respect and tolerance for the competing belief systems of religion, which he describes as being \\"all equally uncontaminated by evidence\\". While focusing on the dangers posed by religious extremist groups now armed with weapons of mass destruction, Harris is equally critical of religious moderation, which he describes as \\"the context in which religious violence can never be adequately opposed.\\" Harris continues by examining the nature of belief itself, challenging the notion that we can in any sense enjoy freedom of belief, and arguing that \\"belief is a fount of action in potentia.\\" Instead he posits that in order to be useful, beliefs must be both logically coherent, and truly representative of the real world. Insofar as religious belief fails to ground itself in empirical evidence, Harris likens religion to a form of mental illness which, he says, \\"allows otherwise normal human beings to reap the fruits of madness and consider them holy.\\" He argues that there may be \\"sanity in numbers\\", but that it is \\"merely an accident of history that it is considered normal in our society to believe that the Creator of the universe can hear your prayers, while it is demonstrative of mental illness to believe that he is communicating with you by having the rain tap in Morse code on your bedroom window.\\" Harris follows this with a brief survey of Christianity down the ages, examining the Inquisition and persecutions of witches and Jews. He contends that, far from being an aberration, the torture of heretics was a logical expression of Christian doctrine - one which, he says, was clearly justified by men such as Saint Augustine. Going still further, Harris sees the Holocaust as essentially drawing its inspiration from historical Christian anti-Semitism. \\"Knowingly or not,\\" he says, \\"the Nazis were agents of religion.\\" Among the controversial aspects of The End of Faith is an uncompromising assessment and criticism of Islamism, which Harris describes as being a \\"cult of death.\\" He infers a clear link between Islamic teaching and terrorist atrocities such as 9/11, a notion he supports with quotations from the Koran that call for the use of violence. He also presents data from the Pew Research Center, purporting to show that significant percentages of Muslims worldwide would justify suicide bombing as a legitimate tactic. In an attack on what he terms \\"leftist unreason,\\" Harris criticises Noam Chomsky among others for, in his view, displaying an illogical willingness to lay the entire blame for such attitudes upon U.S. foreign policy. However, Harris also critiques the role of the Christian right in the United States, in influencing such areas as drug policies, embryonic stem cell research, and AIDS prevention in the developing world. In what he sees as a steady drift towards theocracy, Harris strongly criticises leading figures from both the legislature and the judiciary for what he perceives as an unabashed failure to separate church and state in their various domains. \\"Not only do we still eat the offal of the ancient world,\\" he asserts, \\"we are positively smug about it.\\" Next, Harris goes on to outline what he terms a \\"science of good and evil\\" - a rational approach to ethics, which he claims must necessarily be predicated upon questions of human happiness and suffering. He talks about the need to sustain \\"moral communities,\\" a venture in which he feels that the separate religious moral identities of the \\"saved\\" and the \\"damned\\" can play no part. But Harris is critical of the stance of moral relativism, and also of what he calls \\"the false choice of pacifism.\\" In another controversial passage, he compares the ethical questions raised by collateral damage and judicial torture during war. He concludes that collateral damage is more ethically troublesome. \\"If we are unwilling to torture, we should be unwilling to wage modern war,\\" Harris concludes. Finally, Harris turns to spirituality, where he especially takes his inspiration from the practices of Eastern religion. He writes that there have been mystics in the west and calls some of these \\"extraordinary men and women\\", such as Meister Eckhart, Saint John of the Cross, Saint Teresa of Avila, Saint Seraphim of Sarov, but that, as far as Western spirituality is concerned, \\"we appear to have been standing on the shoulders of dwarfs.\\" He discusses the nature of consciousness, and how our sense of \\"self\\" can be made to vanish by employing the techniques of meditation. Harris quotes from Eastern mystics such as Padmasambhava and Nisargadatta Maharaj, but he does not admit any supernatural element into his argument - \\"mysticism is a rational enterprise,\\" he contends, \\"religion is not.\\" He later elaborates: \\"The mystic has reasons for what he believes, and these reasons are empirical.\\" He states that it is possible for one's experience of the world to be \\"radically transformed\\", but that we must speak about the possibility in \\"rational terms\\".

His essay \\"Response to Controversy\\" also clarified the context of an apparently troubling passage, which was that he was referring to very specific cases like that of the religiously motivated terrorist, where the attempt to kill a murderous terrorist would essentially constitute killing someone for a belief they hold, namely the belief that unbelievers of their particular faith should be killed.\\"Response to Controversy\\", samharris.org.

The pianos sounded like mellow harpsichords, and had a damper stop in the left cheek of the case. Zumpe is known as the creator of English square pianos.  Biography  Of German/Saxon origin, Zumpe trained with the Gottfried Silbermann. He was one of the ‚Äútwelve Apostles‚Äù, German makers of keyboard instruments who fled to London at the time of the Seven Years' War. He worked briefly for Burkat Shudi, before setting up his own shop ‚Äúat the sign of the Golden Guittar‚Äù in Princes Street, Hanover Square, in 1761. Johnannes Zumpe was born in June 1726, and he later arrived in London in early 1750s. From 1769 until 24 September 1778, Zumpe was in partnership with Gabriel Buntebart. Meincke Meyer joined Zumpe in 1778. The business was taken over in 1783 by Frederick Schoene, who advertised his piano-making firm as \\"Successors to Johannes Zumpe\\". Zumpe married Elizabeth Beeston on 3 December 1760. His will, dated 1784, gives his address a Queen Charlotte Row in the parish of St Mary-le-Bow.  Pianos  The pianos in Zumpe's style were built from about 1760 to 1800. In Zumpe's day they played a role not unlike the upright piano of today: they were more compact and affordable than the full-size wing-shaped instrument. As such, they played an important role in the spread of the piano among musicians, particularly amateurs. By the time the last Zumpe pianos were made, the piano had essentially displaced the harpsichord from its formerly predominant position. Johann Christian Bach performed on a Zumpe instrument, and possibly acted as a sales agent for Zumpe pianos. Although most famous for his square pianos, other Zumpe instruments survive, including full-sized pianos, harpsichords, an English guitar of 1762, and a mandora of 1764.  Action  The action of these small instruments is known as the \\"English single\\" and is unusually simple (for instance, it is far simpler than the original piano action as invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori.) It consists of a small \\"sticker\\" simply pushing up on a hammer, while a rod passing through the hitch pin plank lifted up a damper lever hinged from a rail attached to the spine. The action is illustrated below. 800px Action parts: # key; the portion pressed by the player is on the far right # jack; a wire with leather stud on top, known by the workmen as the \\"old man's head\\" # whalebone rear guide, projects from the end of the key, works in a groove to keep the key steady # hammer; strikes the string to produce sound # whalebone jack, called the mopstick # damper; when in lowered position stops the sound of the string # whalebone damper spring References  18th-century English people 18th-century German people Piano makers English musical instrument makers German musical instrument makers English people of German descent 1726 births 1783 deaths Place of birth missing Place of death missing ","title":"Johannes Zumpe"},{"id":"4311879","text":"Donald J. Maloney (1928 Yonkers, New York ‚Äì September 3, 2007) was an American author. He wrote a weekly newspaper column about his life as an American businessman in Japan during the 1970s. Maloney graduated from the Syracuse University School of Journalism in 1948. In 1970, Maloney was assigned to Tokyo by the Harris Corporation (then of Cleveland, Ohio) to engineer Harris' entry into the Japanese market. He negotiated a 50/50 joint venture between Harris and Marubeni Corporation of Japan, and served as managing director and chief operating officer of Marubeni-Harris Printing Equipment Company. He was a member of the Tokyo American Club, American Chamber of Commerce Japan, America-Japan Society, International House, and the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan. Maloney is probably best known in Japan for his humorous newspaper columns published every Sunday in Tokyo's English-language daily, the Japan Times, entitled Never the Twain...? which dealt exclusively with the experience of an American expatriate living in Japan. In 1975, a collection of his articles from 1970‚Äì1974 were published in Japan: It's Not All Raw Fish, , even used as course material by North Carolina State University; followed by Son of Raw Fish. His accounts of life as lived by a foreigner striving in Japan included episodes involving \\"Wife Sarah,\\" his four kids (Frances, Barbara, Shawn and Donald Jr.), his Japanese neighbors and all the shopkeepers, coworkers, policemen and folks from every walk of life were grist for his knee-slapping editorial mill. The Maloney family lived next to Yomiuri Giants manager and former superstar Shigeo Nagashima, providing Maloney with a virtually bottomless pool of column material. An example of Maloney's self- deprecating humor- :\\"All foreigners should total up all the money they are spending each month on Japanese lessons. Drop out of school and send the money to the 'Maloney Final Solution to the Language Problem Fund.' The Fund will use the money to teach English to the Japanese. And since you will have free time, you can hire yourself out to the Fund as an English teacher, earning extra money to boot.\\" He served five two-year terms as a commissioner for the City of Holmes Beach, Florida, beginning in 1995. After losing a reelection bid in 2005, he returned to humor writing, authoring a twice-monthly column for a local newspaper. Maloney died September 3, 2007, at the age of 79. He was survived by his wife of 58 years, Sarah, as well as his four children and twelve grandchildren.

Generally, people meet at a predetermined station in their city's mass transit system, wait until their numbers have achieved critical mass, and board the train. From there, revelers may engage in many different activities, from playing music and dancing to exchanging gifts. There are several kinds of subway parties, the two most distinct being the rush hour subway party and the late night subway party. Rush hour subway parties The stated goal of the rush hour subway party is to spread joy to commuters, whose daily treks into the center of their metropolis can be long, boring or stressful. Several subway party groups have boarded subway cars dressed in goat skins to give presents to commuters, and have been known to play parcheesi, wear wings and sprinkle moon dust on the willing. Critics of subway parties of this kind say that, by introducing chaos, these activities may place the already-crowded subway riders in danger or cause delays. Also, some people may simply become annoyed by them. Late night subway parties Late night subway parties are for the enjoyment of the attendees. Party-goers don costumes, decorate the subway car, bring musical instruments and sometimes the parties have a theme. With the advent of email and cellphones, invitations to subway parties can now be distributed electronically. The party usually starts at one subway station and acquires more participants as it proceeds through the system. The instructions often ask people to meet by the last car of the train. Other subway parties On nights that are especially festive such as New Year's or World Cup victories, a spontaneous subway party may occur. People may already be drinking above ground and decide to board the subway. When this happens, the general feeling of revelry continues below ground. In 2005, the Toronto Transit Commission declared October \\"culture month\\", perhaps inspired by recent subway parties in the city. This campaign included \\"culture cars\\", which were randomly selected cars that contained spontaneous, professional singing, dancing and music. History of the subway party In 1904, the New York City Subway system's first line opened. Photographs from the event show people dressed in tuxedos and top hats and drinking champagne to celebrate. In the 1980s, Michael Alig and the Club Kids threw parties on New York City subway trains where they purportedly took the drug ecstasy. The events were promoted through word of mouth and telephones. These parties are detailed in the book Disco Bloodbath. Today, subway parties are only loosely related to the flash mob phenomenon. The details for subway parties are published on blogs, websites and mailing lists. People assemble seemingly spontaneously in dozens of cities throughout the world.

It is a part of the IDF Central Command's 89th Brigade (commonly referred to as the commando brigade). Prior to 2000, Egoz operated mainly in Lebanon, combating threats from Hezbollah. Following Israel's withdrawal from Southern Lebanon, the unit shifted the focus of its operations to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.  Service in Egoz  Egoz recruits undergo basic and advanced infantry training with the Golani Brigade. Unit recruits then begin an intense 16 months training program to become Egoz special forces operators. One of the most rigorous and physically demanding training regimens in the Israel Defense Forces, Egoz prepares its soldiers for operations in multiple environments in and around Israel and the Palestinian Territories, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in addition to longer range operations behind enemy lines in Lebanon and Syria. Egoz is a flexible and highly trained unit tasked with multiple missions that include irregular warfare, special reconnaissance, direct action, counter-terrorism, and joint special operations. Egoz missions are executed in small teams and are highly classified. The IDF does not disclose information on the unit or the operations in which the unit takes part in.  History  Operators from Egoz are experts in camouflage, which helps them blend into the landscape. Unit Egoz was named after the 1956 special forces reconnaissance unit known as (Sayeret) Egoz. Following a friendly-fire incident, Sayeret Egoz was disbanded, and then restored in 1964, when it continued to operate under the Northern Command. In 1974 it was disbanded once more due to manpower shortages following the Yom Kippur War. Founded as a special forces counter-guerilla unit in 1995 in order to counter Hezbollah operations in Southern Lebanon, Egoz was initially made up of one platoon from the Paratrooper's 5135th Reconnaissance Battalion. The unit's first commander was Erez Zuckerman, who spent much of his military career as a soldier and officer in the Israeli naval commando unit otherwise known as Shayetet 13. As a result, much of the discipline and tactics come from Shayetet 13, and are the foundations upon which the unit was built. Zuckerman led the unit in a series of counter-guerrilla operations in South Lebanon that resulted in a high number of Hezbollah operatives killed. In September 1996 Zuckerman commanded a force from the unit in an operation at Sujud ridge. The force encountered and killed three Hezbollah operatives while suffering two dead and several injured soldiers.Yiftah S. Shapir and Gal Perl Finkel, Subterranean Warfare: A New-Old Challenge, a chapter inside \\"The Lessons of Operation Protective Edge\\", eds. Anat Kurz and Shlomo Brom, INSS, 2014. In the 2006 Lebanon War, five Egoz operators were killed and six wounded in the Battle of Maroun al-Ras, following a direct hit by an AT-3 Sagger anti-tank missile. An estimated 13 members of Hezbollah were killed.ynet In Operation Protective Edge, three members of Unit Egoz were killed during unit operations in the Gaza Strip. On 21 July 2014, in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood of Gaza City, Egoz forces engaged and neutralized ten Hamas militants, including one that detonated a suicide vest. Training Egoz training is split into two phases: * Five month basic and advanced infantry training within the Golani Brigade * Twelve month Egoz training program At the completion of the first phase, recruits begin a specialized training regimen in the Egoz unit. Each Egoz recruit goes through extensive background checks and interviews by Israeli intelligence to determine whether or not they should be screened out of the second phase of training. Those that continue training with the unit begin an intensive twelve month Egoz training program. The training program in Egoz is known to be one of the toughest in the IDF, as can be explained by the notably high drop rate of recruits. The Egoz training program is designed to bring recruits to their mental and physical limits in order to prepare them for their operational service. Among other things, the recruits train in extensive long-range navigation/orienteering, camouflage, reconnaissance, counter-terrorism, and various kinds of warfare and assaults. Egoz is one of a few units in the IDF that trains its recruits in long-range solo navigations. In addition to other highly classified unit-specific courses, every Egoz soldier completes the IDF commanders course.

The glacier is close to sealing off Russell Fjord (top) from Disenchantment Bay (below). A glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a type of outburst flood that occurs when the dam containing a glacial lake fails. An event similar to a GLOF, where a body of water contained by a glacier melts or overflows the glacier, is called a J√∂kulhlaup. The dam can consist of glacier ice or a terminal moraine. Failure can happen due to erosion, a buildup of water pressure, an avalanche of rock or heavy snow, an earthquake or cryoseism, volcanic eruptions under the ice, or massive displacement of water in a glacial lake when a large portion of an adjacent glacier collapses into it. Definition In this Hubbard Glacier image from 16 July 2002, the glacier has closed off Russell Fjord from Disenchantment Bay. The waters behind the glacier rose in 10 weeks, creating a short lived Russell Lake. A glacial lake outburst flood is a type of outburst flood occurring when water dammed by a glacier or a moraine is released. A water body that is dammed by the front of a glacier is called a marginal lake, and a water body that is capped by the glacier is called a sub-glacial lake. When a marginal lake bursts, it may also be called a marginal lake drainage. When a sub-glacial lake bursts, it may be called a j√∂kulhlaup. A j√∂kulhlaup is thus a sub-glacial outburst flood. J√∂kulhlaup is an Icelandic term that has been adopted into the English language, originally referring only to glacial outburst floods from Vatnaj√∂kull, which are triggered by volcanic eruptions, but now is accepted to describe any abrupt and large release of sub-glacial water. Glacial lake volumes vary, but may hold millions to hundreds of millions of cubic metres of water. Catastrophic failure of the containing ice or glacial sediment can release this water over periods of minutes to days. Peak flows as high as 15,000 cubic metres per second have been recorded in such events, suggesting that the v-shaped canyon of a normally small mountain stream could suddenly develop an extremely turbulent and fast-moving torrent some deep. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods are often compounded by a massive river bed erosion in the steep moraine valleys, as a result, the flood peaks increase as they flow downstream until the river reaches, where the sediment deposits. On a downstream floodplain, it suggests a somewhat slower inundation spreading as much as wide. Both scenarios are significant threats to life, property and infrastructure. Monitoring The Hubbard Glacier is overwhelmed on 14 August 2002 in the second largest GLOF in historical times. The United Nations has a series of monitoring efforts to help prevent death and destruction in regions that are likely to experience these events. The importance of this situation has magnified over the past century due to increased populations, and the increasing number of glacial lakes that have developed due to glacier retreat. While all countries with glaciers are susceptible to this problem, central Asia, the Andes regions of South America and those countries in Europe that have glaciers in the Alps, have been identified as the regions at greatest risk.UN Chronicle  Global Warming Triggers Glacial Lakes Flood Threat There are a number of imminent deadly GLOFs situations that have been identified worldwide. The Tsho Rolpa glacier lake is located in the Rolwaling Valley, about northeast of Kathmandu, Nepal, at an altitude of . The lake is dammed by a high unconsolidated terminal moraine dam. The lake is growing larger every year due to the melting and retreat of the Trakarding Glacier, and has become the largest and most dangerous glacier lake in Nepal, with approximately 90 to 100 million m3 (117 to 130 million yd3) of water stored. Examples =Iceland= Remains of a steel bridge, close to Skaftafell, after a glacial outburst The most famous are the immense j√∂kulhlaup released from the Vatnaj√∂kull Ice Cap in Iceland. It is not by chance that the term j√∂kulhlaup (j√∂kull = glacier, hlaup = run (n.)/runningIcelandic online dictionary) comes from Icelandic, as the south of Iceland has very often been the victim of such catastrophes. This was the case in 1996, when the volcano under the Gr√≠msv√∂tn lakes belonging to the Vatnaj√∂kull glacier erupted, and the river Skei√∞ar√° flooded the land in front of Skaftafell, now part of Vatnaj√∂kull National Park. The j√∂kulhlaup reached a flow rate of 50,000 cubic metres per second, and destroyed parts of the Hringvegur (Ring Road or Iceland Road #1). The flood carried ice floes that weighed up to 5000 tons with icebergs between 100‚Äì200 tons striking the Gigjukvisl Bridge of the Ring Road (the ruins are well marked with explanatory signs today as a popular tourist stop). The tsunami released was up to high and wide. The flood carried with it 185 million tons of silt.[Stef√°n Benediktsson and Sigr√∫n Helgad√≥ttir, \\"The Skeiƒëarƒë√° River in Full Flood 1996,\\" Skaftafell National Park: Environment and Food Agency, UST, March, 2007-->] The j√∂kulhlaup flow made it for several days the 2nd largest river (in terms of water flow) after the Amazon. After the flooding, some icebergs high could be seen on the banks of the river where the glacier run had left them behind (see also M√Ωrdalsj√∂kull). The peak water release from a lake that develops around the Gr√≠msv√∂tn Volcanic Crater in the center of the Vatnaj√∂kull ice cap generates flows that exceed the volume of the Mississippi River. The outbursts have occurred in 1954, 1960, 1965, 1972, 1976, 1982, 1983, 1986, 1991 and 1996. In 1996, the eruption melted of ice and yielded an outburst of per second at peak flow. =Alaska= During the late Quaternary, ancient Lake Atna in the Copper River Basin may have generated a number of glacial outburst floods. Some j√∂kulhlaups release annually. Lake George near the Knik River had large annual outbreaks from 1918 to 1966. Since 1966 the Knik Glacier has retreated and an ice-dam is no longer created. Lake George might resume annual floods if the glacier thickens again and blocks the valley (Post and Mayo, 1971). Almost every year, GLOFs occur in two locations in southeastern Alaska, one of which is Abyss Lake. The releases associated with the Tulsequah Glacier near Juneau often inundate a nearby airstrip. About 40 cabins could potentially be affected and a few have been damaged by the larger floods. Events from Salmon Glacier near Hyder have damaged roads near the Salmon River.Aimee Devaris. Southeast Alaska J√∂kulhlaups. Retrieved on 2006-12-03. =Contiguous United States= Immense prehistoric GLOFs, known as the Missoula Floods or Spokane Floods, occurred in North America's Columbia River watershed toward the end of the last ice age. They were the result of periodic breaches of ice dams in present-day Montana, resulting in the draining of a body of water now known as Glacial Lake Missoula. The immense floods scoured the Columbia Plateau as the water raced toward the ocean, resulting in the Channeled Scablands topography that exists today across Central and Eastern Washington. Glacial River Warren drained Glacial Lake Agassiz during the Wisconsinian glaciation; the now mild Minnesota River flows through its bed. This river seasonally drained glacial meltwater into what is now the Upper Mississippi River. The region now termed the Driftless Area of North America was contemporaneously also subject to glacial outburst floods from Glacial Lake Grantsburg, and Glacial Lake Duluth during all three phases of the last ice age. Between 6 and 10 September 2003, a GLOF occurred from Grasshopper Glacier in the Wind River Mountains, Wyoming. A proglacial lake at the head of the glacier burst through a glacial dam, and water from the lake carved a trench down the center of the glacier for more than . An estimated of water were released in four days, raising the flow level of Dinwoody Creek from per second to per second, as recorded at a gauging station downstream. Debris from the flood was deposited more than along the creek. The GLOF has been attributed to the rapid retreat of the glacier, which has been ongoing since the glacier was first accurately measured in the 1960s. = Peru = A flood caused by a glacial lake outburst flood on December 13, 1941 killed an estimated 1,800 people along its path in Peru, including many in the town of Huaraz. The cause was a block of ice that fell from a glacier in the Cordillera Blanca mountains into Lake Palcacocha. This event has been described Mark Carey and Holly Moulton, Adapting to Climate Hazards in the Peruvian Andes, Current History (February 2018). as a historic inspiration for research into glacial lake outburst floods. Numerous Peruvian geologists and engineers created techniques for avoiding such floods and exported the techniques worldwide. =Canada= In 1978, debris flows triggered by a j√∂kulhlaup from Cathedral Glacier destroyed part of the Canadian Pacific railway track, derailed a freight train and buried parts of the Trans Canada Highway. In 1994, a j√∂kulhlaup occurred at Farrow Creek, British Columbia. In 2003, a j√∂kulhlaup drained into Lake Tuborg on Ellesmere Island, and the events and its aftermath were monitored. The ice-dammed lake drained catastrophically by floating its ice dam. This is an extremely rare occurrence in the Canadian High Arctic, where most glaciers are cold based, and ice- dammed lakes typically drain slowly by overtopping their dams. It has been suggested that the Heinrich events during the last glaciation could have been caused by gigantic j√∂kulhlaups from a Hudson Bay lake dammed by ice at the mouth of Hudson Strait. =Bhutan= GLOFs occur with regularity in the valleys and low lying river plains of Bhutan. In the recent past, flash floods have occurred in the Thimphu, Paro and Punankha-Wangdue valleys. Of the 2674 glacial lakes in Bhutan, 24 have been identified by a recent study as candidates for GLOFs in the near future. In October 1994, a GLOF upstream from Punakha Dzong caused massive flooding on the Pho Chhu River, damaging the dzong and causing casualties. In 2001, scientists identified Lake Thorthormi as one that threatened imminent and catastrophic collapse. The situation was eventually relieved by carving a water channel from the lip of the lake to relieve water pressure. =England/France= The Strait of Dover is thought to have been created around 200,000 years ago by a catastrophic GLOF caused by the breaching of the Weald-Artois Anticline, which acted as a natural dam that held back a large lake in the Doggerland region, now submerged under the North Sea. The flood would have lasted several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second. The cause of the breach is not known but may have been caused by an earthquake or simply the build-up of water pressure in the lake. As well as destroying the isthmus that connected Britain to continental Europe, the flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley down the length of the English Channel, leaving behind streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events.\\"Catastrophic flooding origin of shelf valley systems in the English Channel\\". Sanjeev Gupta, Jenny S. Collier, Andy Palmer-Felgate & Graeme Potter. Nature 448, 342‚Äì345 (19 July 2007) =Nepal= Even though GLOF events have been occurring in Nepal for many decades, the Dig Cho glacial lake outburst, which took place in 1985, has triggered detailed study of this phenomenon. In 1996, the Water and Energy Commission Secretariat (WECS) of Nepal reported that five lakes were potentially dangerous, namely, Dig Tsho, Imja, Lower Barun, Tsho Rolpa, and Thulagi, all lying above 4100 m. A recent study done by ICIMOD and UNEP (UNEP, 2001) reported 20 potentially dangerous lakes in Nepal. In ten of them GLOF events have occurred in the past few years and some have been regenerating after the event. Additional dangerous glacial lakes may exist in parts of Tibet that are drained by streams crossing into Nepal, raising the possibility of outburst incidents in Tibet causing downstream damage in Nepal. The Gandaki River basin is reported to contain 1025 glaciers and 338 lakes. Thulagi glacier The Thulagi glacier, which is located in the Upper Marsyangdi River basin, is one out of the two moraine- dammed lakes (supra-glacial lakes), identified as a potentially dangerous lake. The KfW, Frankfurt, the BGR (Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, Germany), in cooperation with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology in Kathmandu, have carried out studies on the Thulagi Glacier and have concluded that even assuming the worst case, a disastrous outburst of the lake can be excluded in the near future.BGR/NLfB/GGA: Gletschersee Thulagi = India = In 1929, a GLOF from the Chong Khumdan Glacier in the Karakoram caused flooding on the Indus River 1,200 km downstream (a maximum flood rise of 8.1 m at Attock).Hewitt, K. (1982) Natural dams and outburst floods of the Karakoram Himalaya =Tibet= Longbasaba and Pida lakes are two moraine- dammed lakes at an altitude of about 5700 m in the Eastern Himalayas. Due to the rise of temperature, the areas of the Longbasaba and Kaer glaciers decreased by 8.7% and 16.6% from 1978 to 2005. Water from glaciers directly flowed into Longbasaba and Pida lakes, and the area of the two lakes increased by 140% and 194%. According to the report of the Hydrological Department of Tibet in 2006, if a GLOF had occurred at the two lakes, 23 towns and villages, where more than 12,500 people live, would have been endangered. In Tibet, one of the major barley producing areas of the Tibetan Plateau was destroyed by GLOFs in August 2000. More than 10,000 homes, 98 bridges and dykes were destroyed and its estimated cost was about $75 million. The farming communities faced food shortages that year by losing their grain and livestock.WWF Nepal Program. \\"An Overview of Glaciers, Glacier Retreat, and Subsequent Impacts in Nepal, India and China\\". 14 March. 2005 A major GLOF was reported in 1978 in the valley of the Shaksgam River in the Karakoram, a part of historic Kashmir, ceded by Pakistan to China. =Swiss Alps= The 1818 Gi√©tro Glacier catastrophe, killing 44 people, originated in a 4-km long valley located in south-western Switzerland. Fatal flooding was known during historical times with 140 deaths first recorded in 1595. After an increase of the glacier during the \\"Year Without a Summer\\", an ice cone started to form from the accumulation of falling seracs. During 1816, the valley filled into a lake which emptied during the spring of 1817. In spring of 1818, the lake measured about 2 km in length. To stop the rapid rise of waters, the canton engineer Ignaz Venetz decided to drill a sluice hole through the ice, tunneling from both upstream and downstream sides of the ice dam at an elevation of about 20 metres above the lake surface. An avalanche interrupted work, so a secondary tunnel was then drilled for safety reasons as the waters rose to 10 metres below. Dangerous sloughing of ice delayed the work until finally a 198-metre-long hole was completed on 4 June, days before lake began to escape via the manmade waterfall on 13 June. Venetz warned the inhabitants of the valley of the danger as water was also escaping from the base of the cone. However, the cone began to crack on the morning of 16 June and at 16:30 the ice dam broke sending 18 million m3 of flood waters into the valley below.

When Sports Illustrated released excerpts from the book on March 7, it generated considerable publicity because the book chronicles alleged extensive use of performance-enhancing drugs, including several different types of steroids and growth hormones, by San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds. Investigation Fainaru-Wada and Williams conducted a two-year investigation centering on the BALCO sports nutrition center, its founder Victor Conte, and Greg Anderson, who served as a personal trainer (and alleged steroid supplier) for Bonds, Gary Sheffield, and Jason Giambi. In the book, the authors provide a summary of their sources, which include over 200 interviews that were conducted in the course of the investigation and over 1000 documents including affidavits from BALCO investigators and grand jury testimony. Based on their findings, Fainaru-Wada and Williams provide reasons that they believe Bonds and the other athletes decided to start taking steroids, and in some cases they provide detailed outlines of the specific steroid regimens set up by Anderson. Other athletes are implicated in the book, including Benito Santiago, track stars Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery, and NFL linebacker Bill Romanowski. Allegations concerning Barry Bonds  The book is among the most damaging accounts of reported steroid use by Bonds. According to the authors, Bonds began using stanozolol, the same drug for which Ben Johnson tested positive after winning the 100 meters at the 1988 Summer Olympics, starting in the 1999 season. By 2001, the year Bonds broke Mark McGwire's single-season home run record with 73, he was alleged to be using the following performance-enhancers: * \\"The cream and the clear,\\" two designer steroids distributed by BALCO * Human growth hormone allegedly sold on the black market by cancer patients to whom it was legitimately prescribed * Insulin, which reportedly enhances the bodybuilding effects of growth hormone * Testosterone decanoate, a steroid often nicknamed \\"Mexican beans\\" or \\"Red beans\\" * Trenbolone, a steroid typically used in livestock, especially cattle * Stanozolol, sold under the brand name Winstrol The authors also allege that at other times he used: *Clomid, a drug normally prescribed for infertility used to restore serum testosterone levels following steroid supplementation *Deca-Durabolin, a common steroid used by bodybuilders *Norbolethone, a steroid developed for the meat industry in the 1960s, and tested for treatment of some conditions in humans, but never marketed because of doubts about its safety. This drug was the original foundation of \\"the clear,\\" which was reformulated at least twice. According to the book, Bonds was inspired to use steroids after watching McGwire's 1998 home run record chase with Sammy Sosa. He began working with Greg Anderson, who would later be hired by the Giants. Anderson reportedly received the substances at issue from BALCO. He also kept meticulous records of Bonds' program; the authors report that Anderson's records indicate that Bonds took up to 20 pills a day and learned to inject himself. The book also claimed that the Giants chose not to confront Bonds about his change in physical appearance, fearing that they would alienate their star slugger, or worse from the team's standpoint, create a drug scandal immediately before the opening of their new stadium. Bonds sued the authors and publisher of the book over its use of grand jury documents and tried to block the publishers and authors from profiting from such documents. On March 24, Judge James Warren denied the request, citing free speech protections for the authors and that the lawsuit had little chance for success. On June 12, 2006, Barry Bonds dropped his lawsuit against the authors. Michael Rains, Bonds‚Äô attorney, stated that he dropped the lawsuit because the authors had been subpoenaed to be part of an investigation into who leaked the secret grand jury transcripts, which is what Bonds wanted all along. On May 5, 2006, Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams were subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury about how they obtained Barry Bonds' leaked grand jury testimony. On May 31, 2006, the authors urged U.S. District Judge Martin Jenkins of San Francisco to excuse them from testifying. This appeal was supported by affidavits from Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein and Mark Corallo, a former press secretary to former Attorney General John Ashcroft. On August 15, 2006, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White ordered Fainaru-Wada and Williams to comply with their subpoenas and testify, lest they be held in contempt and incarcerated until such time as they decide to talk or if the grand jury term expires. They may also be freed from this obligation if a higher court blocks the ruling. The reporters have previously stated that they would rather go to jail than testify. On December 21, 2006, Yahoo! Sports reported that one of Victor Conte's initial defense lawyers, Troy Ellerman, had been targeted by the FBI as a possible source of leaks to unspecified members of the media during the Barry Bonds probe. On December 22, the Associated Press reported that the federal government filed papers on December 21 stating the two Chronicle reporters‚Äîand authors of Game of Shadows‚Äîshould receive the maximum 18 months imprisonment for allegedly leaking grand jury information. On February 14, 2007, Ellerman pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. In the plea agreement, Ellerman will spend two years in jail and pay a $250,000 fine. The government also dropped their case against Williams and Fainaru-Wada.

It is the largest and least studied bat in Europe with a wingspan of up to and is one of the few bat species to feed on passerine birds. Greater noctule bats are the only bat species to hunt birds on the wing rather than when roosting. The greater noctule bat has wings adapted for open-air hunting and uses echolocation frequencies above the hearing range of birds.Dondini, G. & Vergari, S. 2000.Ibanez C. et al., 2001. Description The greater noctule bat belongs to the suborder Microchiroptera and uses echolocation. Echolocation is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness. The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark. The greater noctule bat has keen hearing and sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed. The wings of the greater noctule bat are thinner than those of birds which allow it to maneuver quickly and accurately. While its wing is delicate and rips easily, it is able to regrow. The greater noctule is the largest bat in Europe, with a wingspan of . Its head-and-body length is from , its tail is from and its forearm ranges from . The body mass of adults ranges from . Macdonald, D.W. & Barrett, P. 1993. The greater noctule bat has been observed as a high altitude flier and a low altitude forager. The dorsal fur of the greater noctule bat is uniformly reddish-brown to dark brown. Its muzzle is broad with enlarged short ears and its tragus (ear) is broad, short, and mushroom-shaped. Calcar, also known as calcaneum, is present and it reaches close to midway to the tail membrane.Thabah, A. et al. 2007. The greater noctule bat has a robust skull and its rostrum is square with an ordinary nasal slit. The zygomatic arches are very slender and the braincase is smooth, turned upwards. The sagittal crest is not present, while the lambdoid crest is well developed. Most of the projecting point of the skull is made up of exoccipital condyles. The basisphenoid is wide and deep and the tympanic bullae are relatively small. Yignit, N. et al. 2008. Taxonomy and evolution Even though the fossil record of bats extends over 50 million years, their fossils are extremely rare. The fossil record of the greater noctule in the Iberian Peninsula suggests that they lived at different geographical locations from that of today. The fossils of greater noctule are almost non-existent prior to the Miocene epoch. The deterioration of the climate at the end of Neogene led to the disappearance of tropical species and vespertilionids profited by accessing a wider range of habitats.Garcia, J.M. et al. 2009. Habitat The greater noctule bat is a tree-dwelling bat that roosts in trees all year round. It is found throughout the deciduous forests of Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the Bosporus region of Turkey.Popa- Lisseanu, A.G. et al. 2007.Popa-Lisseanu, A.G. et al. 2008. The largest concentration of greater noctule bat is in the south western portion of Spain. The greater noctule bat is a tree-obligate species that prefers oak or beech trees that have a hollow space for day roosting. Greater noctule bats also roost in pine trees if there are no other options. Other studies have shown that this bat greatly prefers birch trees. This suggests that the greater noctule bat does not prefer a specific tree, but perhaps looks for the physical condition of the tree. It has been noted in several studies of greater noctule bat roosting behavior that different trees have different functions for the greater noctule bat, and that these tree-specific needs could affect roost selection for communities of greater noctule bats. Studies in Hungary (Ke¬¥ kes peak, 1014 m a.s.l.) indicates that greater noctules prefer high roost locations. The study also hypothesizes that older, decayed trees are preferred by the species. Estok, P. 2007. Diet While the majority of the world's carnivorous bats are insect-eaters, greater noctule bats do regularly prey on birds. One study has shown that predation on birds accounts for over 80% of the greater noctule bat‚Äôs diet during periods of the year when the birds are migrating. The greater noctule bat switches its prey type opportunistically depending on the time of year. In addition, with the possible exception of the Asian great evening bat, the greater noctule bat is the only bat that hunts birds on the wing rather than when roosting. The greater noctule is well adapted for hunting passerines in the air. It is large in size, has wings with a wingspan of up to 46 centimeters that are evolved for open-air hunting, and it employs echolocation with frequencies beyond the hearing range of birds. Mating and reproduction N. lasiopterus is understudied due to its rarity; very little is known of its mating habits, reproductive pattern, life cycle and sex ratio. N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are dominant in cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. Ibanez, C. et al. 2009. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.Estok, P. et al. 2007. Ecological interactions The greater noctule bat is known to participate in a fission-fusion society.Fortuna, M. et al. 2009. These societies vary in size, but studies show that each society has a social order and a territory in a specific group of trees that are used for roosting and breeding. The greater noctule bat has been shown to travel between several roosting sites and to participate in several societies through radio tracking studies. It has been conjectured that ranking in society dictates different roles in society, e.g. some bats are scouts, others are hunters. There has been correlation between a specific bat's social ranking and the size of that bat's potential home range; the higher the social ranking, the lower the home range. The greater noctule bat has an observed active range of 2500 km2. which is one of the largest observed ranges for any bat species. This large area of activity has several effects on the way the greater noctule bat forages and roosts. It has been noted that changes by humans to the natural environment could have had an effect on the way the greater noctule bat travels and roosts in its attempts to find suitable food sources. It has been noted that a lack of roosting sites near food sources could be the reason for the large home range that is displayed by the greater noctule bat. Differences observed between two populations of bats with drastically different habitats, Great Britain and Spain respectively, show that the greater noctule bat would not travel great distances for food unless absolutely necessary. This need to fly great distances for food has been theorized as a reason for the decline of the species. One study reported finding a greater noctule bat on the ground exhausted from flight. Another study of owl droppings found in areas in between GNB roosting sites has shown that the greater noctule bat is susceptible to predation in flight. Jones, G. & Rydell, J. 1994. It has also been noted that the foraging range for the greater noctule bat increases during the lactating period for the greater noctule bat, potentially due to an increased need for energy. The greater noctule bat is also known to increase its foraging range in response to different levels of potential food sources. In the summer and fall months, when water levels and insect abundance is lower in the northern parts of Europe, the greater noctule bat has been found to increase its foraging range south to areas with a larger abundance of insects. The greater noctule bat is also one of the few known species of bat that also preys on nocturnally migrating birds. These birds tend to pause for rest during the day in the marshland fields that the greater noctule bat forages for insects in at night. When the birds start to migrate again at dusk, the greater noctule bat is known to prey on them during flight. These changes in habitat based solely on food source suggest that the greater noctule bat is heavily dependent upon areas that can support its food supply regardless of how far it must travel to get to their prey. The greater noctule bat also interacts with parasites that live in the trees that they roost in and transfer themselves to the bats while they are sleeping. The greater noctule bat also interacts with the few nocturnal flying predators in its area, mainly owls that are much larger than the bat. Evidence of greater noctule bat bones have been found in owl pellets. Threats The most common predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat generally leaves its roost to forage after it is already completely dark outside, this coincides with the general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also some risk to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats. In Seville, Spain, one of the largest breeding colonies in Europe, the bats are in danger of obliteration. Rose- ringed parakeets, an invasive species, compete for homes in tree hollows, attacking and killing the bats. There has been an 81% decrease in trees inhabited by the bats since researchers first began keeping track. Conservation The greater noctule bat is currently classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is classified as 'vulnerable' in Spain (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, 2006). No other country in Europe has a specific endangered status for the greater noctule bat. =Conservation proposals= The organism separates itself socially and spatially with roosts. A colony has several roosts, with most of the populations centered in one large roost and several fringe roosts which other bat species may share. These are useful for sharing information between colonies. These roosts however can communicate disease and parasites. The individuals often fly from one roost to another to exchange information, and this also creates a pathway for infection. For reasons uncertain, such as being perhaps too advantageous to the colony, they continue to roost within these trees despite the disadvantages to themselves. It would be beneficial to the conservation of the species to locate the trees with roosts that have high levels of disease/ parasite infections in addition to high rates of transfers between roosts and cut them down to lessen the rate of infection among them. The functions of each roost also needs to be identified, as to understand which roosts would be better left intact. However, only day roosts studies were performed, and further research into their nocturnal habits may be required. The species has not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and possibly housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, it was found that the species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.

Motorcycle production ceased in 1988 but the company remained in operation as Mego until 1992, servicing its products with parts, etc. Subsequently, it was renamed Gorgolis S.A., focusing on import and distribution of motorcycles. Nipponia Since 1992 the company also branched in a new venture, creating subsidiaries in Japan, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and China, marketing and selling motorcycles. The brand Nipponia was established (as a reference to Japanese-style excellence) for a series of Greek-designed, Chinese-built motorcycles sold in several countries. A world headquarters of Nipponia was subsequently established in Athens responsible for design, engineering, marketing and quality control for motorcycles built in Shanghai, China. Its latest range is designed by Sotiris Kovos (designer of the Toyota Yaris and other Toyota models) and currently marketed in Europe.

He was a newspaper editor for the Tennessean, Nashville's morning paper, and President of the American Press Humorists Association. Biography Born Dixon Lanier Abernathy, his parents divorced while he was a child and one of his five uncles subsequently adopted him. At age 21, he legally changed his surname to Merritt, which he regretted later in life. Dixon Merritt was married twice. He was first married to Harriotte Triplett Johnson of Kentucky, with whom he had a son and a daughter, though the marriage ended in divorce. He later married Ruth Yates of New York, with whom he had two sons. He penned this well-known limerick in 1910: > :A wonderful bird is the pelican, :His bill will hold more than his belican, > :He can take in his beak :Enough food for a week :But I'm damned if I see > how the helican! or: > :A funny old bird is a pelican. :His beak can hold more than his belican. : > Food for a week : He can hold in his beak, :But I don't know how the > helican.

It is quoted in a number of scholarly works on ornithology, including Manual of Ornithology: Avian Structure and Function, by Noble S. Proctor and Patrick J. Lynch, and several others. Merritt served as Tennessee State Director of Public Safety, taught at Cumberland University and was editor of The Tennessean and Lebanon Democrat newspapers and later contributed a column for many years called \\"Our Folks\\". In 1913 he collaborated with Will Thomas Hale on \\"A History of Tennessee and Tennesseans: The Leaders and Representative Men in Commerce, Industry and Modern Activities\\". During the 1920s he was the Southern correspondent for Outlook magazine, a weekly news magazine aimed at rural readers. He edited a comprehensive \\"History of Wilson County (Tennessee)\\" in his eighties. He worked for the U.S. federal government twice, around the time of both World Wars, and ultimately retired from the Rural Electrification Administration's telephone program office. In 1919, Merritt was the Assistant in Charge for the Press Service at the United States Department of Agriculture where he wrote humorous press releases. Merritt was a founding member of the Tennessee Ornithological Society. A nature center at the Tennessee Cedars of Lebanon State Park is named for him. He served as President of the Society of American Press Humorists. Following World War I he returned to the familial farm near Lebanon, TN and using portions of various cedar log cabins nearly one hundred years old assembled a new structure on a hill which he dubbed \\"Cabincroft\\" ‚Äî 'croft' being a Scottish word for a place of shelter. He maintained a working farm into his seventies preferring natural methods.

The highway extends from Logan Avenue (where it becomes CR 635), at the boundary between Trenton and Hamilton Township in Mercer County to an interchange with U.S. Route 9 (US 9) and Route 35 in South Amboy, Middlesex County. The road serves as the main street through the communities of Cranbury, South River and Sayreville, while also passing through rural areas on the outskirts of Mercer and southern Middlesex counties. At various points, it is locally known as East State Street, Edinburg Road, Old Trenton Road, Cranbury-South River Road, Main Street, Washington Road, and Raritan Street. Route description CR 535 westbound in Hamilton Township The designation of CR 535 picks up East State Street at the Trenton city line and heads northeast into the Bromley neighborhood of Hamilton. It parallels the Northeast Corridor line between both municipalities' respective train stations before abruptly turning southeast at , an intersection with Klockner Road. Now the East State Street Extension and maintained by Hamilton Township, CR 535 meets Interstate 295 (I-295) with limited access at exit 64. Traffic traveling southbound on CR 535 (traveling geographically north for this brief stretch) has a ramp leading to I-295 north toward US 1, while southbound traffic on the freeway can exit onto CR 535 north. From here, CR 535 continues toward Nottingham Way (CR 652), and turns left onto it, about east of where Route 33 merges onto Nottingham Way. County maintenance resumes at this point and CR 535 stays on this road for just before reaching a five-way intersection with Route 533 (Quakerbridge Road north of the intersection, White Horse-Mercerville Road south of it) and Nottingham Way, which is CR 618 as it travels southeast away from the intersection toward Hamilton Square. CR 535 and CR 526 in Edinburg Having regained its northeast direction, CR 535 moves through this intersection and becomes Edinburg Road. At a traffic signal with Paxson Avenue, the road widens to two lanes in each direction. It leaves Hamilton for West Windsor, and bumps up against Mercer County Community College on the left. Just beyond the college is Mercer County Park, which is accessible through South Post Road (CR 602) or through the park's official west entrance after CR 535's reduction to one lane each way. Just beyond the park entrance, the route has a short concurrency with CR 526, which comes from Robbinsville Township to the south. Less than later, CR 526 turns due north again and heads for Princeton Junction while Windsor Road (CR 641) travels southeast. CR 535 continues to the northeast as Old Trenton Road, crossing into East Windsor. In East Windsor, it intersects CR 571, with the entrance to the Route 133 bypass of Hightstown visible to the right. CR 535 crosses the Millstone River and into Middlesex County. CR 535 northbound in Cranbury Township CR 535 is now traversing Cranbury, traveling for a just under before reaching the township's Main Street. It turns left toward the downtown area, while CR 539 comes from the right on South Main Street and ends while CR 685 continues down Old Trenton Road to its terminus at US 130. Once through Cranbury, CR 535 turns right onto Plainsboro Road and shortly thereafter, merges into another short concurrency, this time with US 130. After less than , it breaks off to the right, taking a north-by-northeast path toward the New Jersey Turnpike and the lower Raritan River valley. CR 535 enters South Brunswick Township. Though signed at various points as Cranbury-South River Road, South River Road and Cranbury Road, it is officially only the latter. It meets Route 32, providing access to the Turnpike as it passes to the right. Originally all traffic to and from the Turnpike's exit 8A used Route 32, but vehicles leaving the Turnpike and not traveling towards Jamesburg now exit onto CR 535. CR 535 runs along the boundary between South Brunswick and Monroe and then crosses under the Turnpike. It leaves the border for a short stretch starting at an intersection with CR 522, then returns to what is now the township line with East Brunswick Township for . Later it enters East Brunswick completely. CR 535 is one of the main thoroughfares of East Brunswick, along with Route 18, Ryders Lane (CR 617), and Dunhams Corner Road. The latter branches off at the same point CR 535 moves all the way into the township, banks hard to the right at East Brunswick Community Park just shy of the Turnpike, then rejoins CR 535. CR 535 intersects Ryders Lane, passes East Brunswick High School on the right, then approaches a complex interchange with Route 18, providing access to New Brunswick and the Turnpike at exit 9 to the northwest, Old Bridge and shore points to the south, and Spotswood via CR 613 (Summerhill Road). CR 535 itself continues north and crosses into the borough of South River at the crossing of the Old Bridge Turnpike (CR 527). CR 535 through Parlin CR 535 crosses the South River via the Veteran's Memorial Bridge and into Sayreville. Though Main Street (CR 670) breaks off, CR 535 (Washington Road) serves the more densely populated southern half of the borough (through the community of Parlin), as well as Sayreville War Memorial High School and Sayreville Middle School. CR 535 enters the outskirts of South Amboy though it comes up just short of the border between the two municipalities. later, it crosses underneath the Garden State Parkway and reaches its former northern terminus, an intersection with the other end of Sayreville's Main Street. CR 535 becomes Raritan Street continues another mile to enter South Amboy and ends an interchange with the concurrency of US 9 and Route 35 on approach to the Edison Bridge and the Victory Bridge, respectively.

Early life  Born in Alfaraz de Sayago (province of Zamora), he was raised in , where his father worked as school teacher. After studying Arts and Sciences at the Central University of Madrid, where he was a disciple of Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, and contributing to La Gaceta Literaria and Revista de Occidente, Ledesma Ramos began studying the works of Martin Heidegger. He also wrote a novel for the youth, entitled El sello de la muerte (\\"The Seal of Death\\"). Attracted to both Benito Mussolini's Corporatism, and the developing Nazi movement of Adolf Hitler in Germany, he was troubled by his middle class roots, which he saw as an obstacle in reaching out to the revolutionary milieu of Spanish politics in the 1920s. In 1931, Ledesma Ramos began publishing the periodical La Conquista del Estado, named in tribute to Curzio Malaparte's Italian Fascist magazine La Conquista dello Stato‚Äîone of the first publications of the Spanish National- Syndicalism. It attempted to bridge the gap between nationalism and the anarcho-syndicalist of the dominant trade union, the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT), by revising Syndicalism altogether. His admiration for National Socialism brought him to imitate Adolf Hitler's hairstyle.Hugh Thomas (1976); Historia de la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola. C√≠rculo de Lectores, Barcelona. p. 194  La Conquista del Estado and the Falange  In the very first issue of the La Conquista del Estado (The Conquest of the State), Ledesma published a syncretic program, which advertised statism, a political role for the universities, regionalisation, and a syndicalist structure for the national economy. The paper was only published throughout the year, and, although a subject of debate in a CNT reunion, it never had the intended impact. He subsequently led his group into an October 1931 merger with On√©simo Redondo's Junta Castellana de Actuaci√≥n Hisp√°nica, creating the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista, and its magazine JONS. It became the Falange Espa√±ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista (FE-JONS), after it fused with Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera's group in 1934; he personally designed the movement's badge, the yoke and the arrows derived from the Catholic Monarchs, and coined the mottos Arriba Espa√±a and Una, Grande y Libre (both of which were still in use in Francoist Spain).  Death and legacy  The group remained stable, despite the fact that Ledesma left over disagreements with Primo de Rivera; he formed a small group, La Patria Libre, which opposed the Falange on ideological grounds, displaying the same favorable attitude to the left-wing trade unions. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War caught Ledesma in Republican Madrid, far from the forces of Francisco Franco. Imprisoned by the Popular Front government because of suspected espionage throughout the summer and early autumn of 1936, he was executed by the Republican militia.

While a musket was largely inaccurate over 80 yards, due to a lack of rifling and a generous tolerance to allow for muzzle-loading, it was cheaper to produce and could be loaded quickly. The use in volley or in mass firing by troops meant that rate of fire took precedence over accuracy. A similar tactical preference would be a factor in considerations regarding rifle design in the late 19th century to early 20th century, when rate of fire would be a key design consideration for British bolt-action rifles. Beginning in the late 1830s, the superior characteristics of the new rifles caused the British military to phase out the venerable .75 calibre Brown Bess musket in favour of muzzle-loading rifles in smaller calibres. Early rifles were non- standard and frequently used adaptations from components of the Brown Bess, including locks and stocks adapted to new rifled barrels. It was not until the late 19th century that the rifle fully supplanted the musket as the weapon of the infantryman. Rifles before 1800 Civilian rifles had on rare occasions been used by marksmen during the English Civil War (1642‚Äì51). In the 1750s, a few German rifles were used by British light infantry regiments in the Seven Years' War. =Pattern 1776 Infantry Rifle= Pattern 1776 rifle In January 1776, 1,000 rifles were ordered to be built for the British Army. A pattern by gunsmith William Grice, based on German rifles in use by the British Army, was approved for official issue as the Pattern 1776 Infantry Rifle. This weapon was issued to the light company of each regiment in the British Army during the American Revolution; these were probably present at most battles in the conflict in the American Revolution. =Ferguson rifle= Ferguson rifle Also in 1776, Major Patrick Ferguson patented his breech-loading Ferguson rifle, based on old French and Dutch designs of the 1720s and 1730s. One hundred of these, of the two hundred or so made, were issued to a special rifle corps in 1777, but the cost, production difficulties and fragility of the guns, coupled with the death of Ferguson at the Battle of Kings Mountain meant the experiment was short-lived. Baker Rifle The Baker rifle was a muzzle- loading flintlock weapon used by the British Army in the Napoleonic Wars, notably by the 95th Rifles and the 5th Battalion, 60th Regiment of Foot. This rifle was an accurate weapon for its day, with reported kills being made at away. At Cacabelos, in 1809, Rifleman Tom Plunkett, of the 95th, shot the French General Colbert at a range allegedly of 400 yards. The rifle was in service in the British Army until the 1840s. The Mexican Army, under Santa Anna, used British Baker Rifles during the 1836 Texas-Mexican War. Brunswick rifle The Brunswick rifle was a .704 calibre muzzle-loading percussion rifle manufactured for the British Army at the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield in the early 19th century. The weapon was introduced to replace the Baker rifle and weighed from over without its bayonet attached, depending on the pattern. The weapon was difficult to load but remained in production for about 50 years (1836 to 1885) and was used in both the United Kingdom and assorted colonies and outposts throughout the world. The Brunswick had a two-groove barrel designed to accept a \\"belted\\" round ball. There are four basic variants of the British Brunswick Rifle (produced in .654 and .704 calibre, both oval bore rifled and smoothbore). They are the Pattern 1836, the Pattern 1841, the Pattern 1848 and the Pattern 1840 Variant. Early Enfield rifles Throughout the evolution of the British rifle the name Enfield is prevalent; this refers to the Royal Small Arms Factory in the town (now suburb) of Enfield north of London, where the British Government produced various patterns of muskets from components manufactured elsewhere beginning in 1804. The first rifle produced in whole to a set pattern at Enfield was the Baker rifle. Brunswick rifles were also produced there, but, prior to 1851, rifles were considered speciality weapons and served alongside the muskets, which were issued to regular troops. =Pattern 1851= In 1851, the Enfield factory embarked upon production of the .702-inch Pattern 1851 Mini√© rifle using the conical Minie bullet, which replaced the Pattern 1842 .753 calibre smoothbore musket as the primary weapon issued to regular troops. The Pattern 1851 was referred to as a rifled musket and was longer than previous production rifles, conforming to the length of prior muskets, which allowed for consistency in standards for firing in ranks and bayonet combat. Relatively few of these were produced, since a new design was adopted within two years. The rifle used the lock and bayonet mount from the Pattern 1842, with a barrel. The new Minie ammunition allowed much faster loading, so that rifles were no longer slower to load than smoothbore muskets. Previous rifles, such as the Baker and the Brunswick, were designated for special troops, such as skirmishers or snipers, while the majority of shoulder-arms remained smoothbore muskets. =Pattern 1853= Pattern 1853 Enfield The Pattern 1853 Enfield used a smaller .577 calibre Minie bullet. Several variations were made, including infantry, navy and artillery versions, along with shorter carbines for cavalry use. The Pattern 1851 and Pattern 1853 were both used in the Crimean War, with some logistical confusion caused by the need for different ammunition. The Pattern 1853 was popular with both sides of the American Civil War; the Confederacy and the Union imported these through agents who contracted with private companies in Britain for production. =Pattern 1858= The Pattern 1858 naval rifle was developed for the British Admiralty in the late 1850s with a heavier 5-grooved barrel. The heavier barrel was designed to withstand the leverage from the naval cutlass bayonet, but may have contributed to accuracy. =Pattern 1858 Indian Service= There is also the very short-lived Pattern 1858 developed from the Pattern 1853 for Indian service. A consequence of the rebellion, based on British fears, was to modify the native infantry long arms by reaming out the rifling of the Pattern 1853 which greatly reduced the effectiveness, as was replacing the variable distance rear sight with a fixed sight. This became the Pattern 1858, with an increased bore of 0.656\\" from 0.577\\" and a thinner barrel wall. Bulging and bursting of the barrel became an issue, as well as excessive flexing when the bayonet was fitted. To remedy this, new barrels were made with a thicker wall and became the Pattern 1859. =Pattern 1859 Indian Service (modified)= The Indian Service variant became the new standard issue and, when comparing the P1859 with the P1853, side-by-side, the difference would only become apparent if one was to feel just inside the muzzle for the presence of rifling or not. The British retained the superior earlier pattern for their own use. =Pattern 1860= The Enfield \\"Short Rifle\\" was a percussion rifle used extensively by the North and South in the US Civil War. It was generally well regarded for its accuracy, even with its short barrel. It was also used by the British Army. =Pattern 1861 Enfield Musketoon= Pattern 1861 Enfield Musketoon The Pattern 1861 Enfield Musketoon was an alteration to the Pattern 1853 Enfield Musketoon. The alteration gave the Pattern 1861 a faster twist, which gave it more accuracy than the longer Pattern 1853 Enfield rifle. In England, it was issued to artillery units, who required a weapon for personal defence. It was imported by the Confederacy and issued to artillery and cavalry units.  Snider‚ÄìEnfield Rifles  In 1866, the Snider‚ÄìEnfield was produced as a conversion of Enfield Pattern 1853 with a hinged breechblock and barrel designed for a .577 cartridge. Later Sniders were newly manufactured on the same design. The action was invented by an American, Jacob Snider, and adopted by Britain as a conversion system for the 1853 Enfield. The conversions proved both more accurate than original muzzle- loading Enfields and much faster firing as well. Converted rifles retained the original iron barrel, furniture, locks and cap-style hammers. The rifles were converted in large numbers, or assembled new with surplus pattern 53 iron barrels and hardware. The Mark III rifles were made from all new parts with steel barrels, flat-nosed hammers and are the version equipped with a latch- locking breech block. The Snider was the subject of substantial imitation, approved and otherwise, including: Nepalese Sniders, the Dutch Sniders, Danish Naval Sniders, and the \\"unauthorized\\" adaptations resulting in the French Tabatiere and Russian Krnka rifles. The Snider‚ÄìEnfield Infantry rifle was particularly long at over . The breech block housed a diagonally downward- sloping firing pin which was struck with a front-action side-mounted hammer. The firer cocked the hammer, flipped the block out of the receiver with a breech block lever, and then pulled the block back to extract the spent case. There was no ejector, the case had to be pulled out, or more usually, the rifle rolled onto its back to allow the case to fall out. The Snider saw service throughout the British Empire, until it was gradually phased out of front line service in favour of the Martini‚ÄìHenry, in the mid-1870s. The design continued in use with colonial troops into the 20th century.British .577 Snider  Martini‚ÄìHenry Rifles  The Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle was adopted in 1871, featuring a tilting-block single-shot breech-loading action, actuated by a lever beneath the wrist of the buttstock. The Martini‚ÄìHenry evolved as the standard service rifle for almost 20 years, with variants including carbines. Unlike the Snider it replaced, the Martini‚ÄìHenry was designed from the ground up as a breech-loading metallic cartridge firearm. This robust weapon uses a tilting-block, with a self-cocking, lever operated, single-shot action designed by a Swiss, Friedrich von Martini, as modified from the Peabody design. The rifling system was designed by Scotsman, Alexander Henry. The Mark I was adopted for service in 1871. There were three further main variations of the Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle, the Marks II, III and IV, with sub variations of these called patterns. In 1877, a carbine version entered service with five main variations including cavalry and artillery versions. Initially, Martinis used the short chamber Boxer-Henry .45 calibre black powder cartridge made of a thin sheet of brass rolled around a mandrel, which was then soldered to an iron base. Later, the rolled brass case was replaced by a solid brass version which remedied a myriad of problems.M1889 British Martini‚ÄìHenry Marks I-IV =Martini‚ÄìMetford and Martini‚ÄìEnfield= Martini‚ÄìEnfield rifles were mostly conversions of the Zulu War era .450/577 Martini‚ÄìHenry, rechambered to the .303 British calibre, although a number were newly manufactured. Early Martini‚ÄìHenry conversions, began in 1889, using Metford rifled barrels (Martini‚ÄìMetford rifles), which were more than suitable for the first black powder .303 cartridges, but they wore out very quickly when fired with the more powerful smokeless ammunition introduced in 1895, so that year the Enfield rifled barrel was introduced, which was suitable for smokeless ammunition. The Martini‚ÄìEnfield was in service from 1895 to 1918 (Lawrence of Arabia's Arab Irregulars were known to have used them during the Arab Revolt of 1916‚Äì1918), and it remained a reserve arm in places like India and New Zealand well into World War II.  Lee‚ÄìMetford rifles  Lee‚ÄìMetford rifle The first British repeating rifle incorporated a bolt-action and a box-magazine; this was developed through trials beginning in 1879, and adopted as the Magazine Rifle Mark I in 1888. This rifle is commonly referred to as the Lee‚ÄìMetford or MLM (Magazine Lee‚ÄìMetford). The \\"Lee\\" comes from James Paris Lee (1831‚Äì1904), a Scottish-born Canadian-American inventor who designed an easy-to-operate turnbolt and a high-capacity box magazine to work with it. The box magazine, either Lee or Mannlicher designed, proved superior in combat to the Kropatschek-style tube magazine used by the French in their Lebel rifle, or the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rotary magazine used in the first US bolt-action rifle (M1892). The initial Lee magazine was a straight stack, eight-round box, which was superseded by the staggered, ten-round box in later versions, in each case more than were accommodated by Mannlicher box magazine designs. The \\"Metford\\" comes from William Ellis Metford (1824‚Äì1899), an English engineer who was instrumental in perfecting the .303 calibre jacketed bullet and rifling to accommodate the smaller diameter. During the development of the Lee‚ÄìMetford, smokeless powder was invented. The French and Germans were already implementing their second-generation bolt-action rifles, the 8 mm Lebel in 1886 and 7.92 mm Gewehr 88 in 1888 respectively, using smokeless powder to propel smaller diameter bullets. The British followed the trend of using smaller diameter bullets, but the Lee‚ÄìMetford design process overlapped the invention of smokeless powder, and was not adapted for its use. However, in 1895, the design was modified to work with smokeless powder resulting in the Lee‚ÄìEnfield. A contrast between this design and other successful bolt actions of the time, such as the Mausers and US Springfield, is the rear locking lug. This puts the lug close to the bolt handle, where the pressure is applied by the operator; in essence the force is close to the fulcrum point. Without great explanation, this results in an easier and swifter operation versus the Mauser design, resulting in a greater rate of fire. However, the sacrifice is strength as the fulcrum point has moved away from the force of the explosion, thus making the length of the bolt a lever working against the holding power of the rear lug. This was a limiting factor in the ballistics capacity of this design. Another difference between the Lee and the Mauser designs was the use of \\"cock-on-closing\\", which also helped to speed cycling by making the initial opening of the breech very easy. The closing stroke, which is generally more forceful than the opening stroke, cocks the rifle, adding to the ease of use. The Lee design also featured a shorter bolt travel and a 60-degree rotation of the bolt; these attributes also led to faster cycle times. Over the service life of the design, proponents and opponents would stress rate-of-fire versus ballistics respectively. The basic Lee design with some tinkering was the basis for most British front-line rifles until after World War II.  Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles  Lee-Enfield rifle In 1895, the Lee‚ÄìMetford design was reinforced to accommodate the higher chamber pressures of smokeless powder; more critically, the barrel rifling was changed to one developed by the Enfield factory owing to the incompatibility of the Metford barrel design with smokeless powder (the barrels becoming unusable after less than 5,000 rounds). The designation was changed to Rifle, Magazine, Lee‚ÄìEnfield Mark I or MLE (magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfield). The sights also had to be changed to reflect the flatter trajectory and longer ranges of the improved cartridge. The Martini‚ÄìHenry, Lee‚ÄìMetford, and Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles have an overall length just under . In each case, several variants of carbines were offered in the under range for uses by cavalry, artillery, constabularies and special troops. Starting in 1909, MLE and MLM rifles were converted to use charger loading, which was accomplished by modifying the bolt, modifying the front and rear sights, and adding a charger guide bridge to the action body, thereby allowing the use of chargers to more rapidly load the magazines. Upgraded to a more modern standard, these rifles served in combat in the First World War. = The Short Magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfield (SMLE) ‚Äì also known as Rifle, Number 1 = Before World War I, the Rifle, Short, Magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfield, or SMLE, was developed to provide a single rifle to offer a compromise length between rifles and carbines, and to incorporate improvements deemed necessary from experience in the Boer War. With a length of , the new weapon was referred to as a \\"short rifle\\"; the word \\"short\\" refers to the length of the rifle, not the length of the magazine. From 1903 to 1909, many Metford and Enfield rifles were converted to the SMLE configuration with shorter barrels and modified furniture. Production of the improved SMLE Mk III began in 1907. Earlier Mk I and Mk II rifles were upgraded to include several of the improvements of the Mk III. The compromise length was consistent with military trends as the US Springfield M1903 was only produced in the compromise length and the Germans adopted the kurz (short) rifle concept between the world wars for the Mauser 98k (model 1898 short). = Training Rifle ‚Äì Rifle, Number 2 = To conserve resources in training, the British Army converted many .303 rifles to .22 calibre for target practice and training purposes after the First World War. In 1926, the British government changed the nomenclature of its rifles, designating the .303 calibre SMLE as No. 1 Rifles and the .22 calibre training rifles as No. 2 Rifles. For practical purposes \\"SMLE\\" and \\"No. 1 Rifle\\" are alternate names for the same weapon, but a purist would define a No. 1 as post-1926 production only. Pattern 1913 Enfield The Pattern 1913 Enfield (P13) was an experimental rifle developed by the British Army ordnance department to serve as a replacement for the Short Magazine Lee‚ÄìEnfield (SMLE). Although a completely different design from the Lee‚ÄìEnfield, the Pattern 1913 rifle was designed by the Enfield engineers. In 1910, the British War Office considered replacing the SMLE based on its inferior performance compared to the Mauser rifles used by the enemy in the Boer War. The major shortcoming was long range performance and accuracy due to the ballistics of the .303 round, but the bolt system of the SMLE was not believed to have the strength to chamber more potent ammunition. A rimless .276 cartridge, which was comparable to the 7 mm Mauser, was developed.  Pattern 1914 ‚Äì also known as Rifle, Number 3  Pattern 14 rifle (derivative) With the outbreak of the First World War, the change to the ammunition for the Pattern 1913 was abandoned; however, to supplement SMLE production the new design was to be produced chambered for .303. In 1914, the Pattern 1914 rifle (Pattern 13 chambered for .303) was approved for production by British companies, but production was superseded by other war priorities, and three US firms Winchester, Eddystone, and Remington began production in 1916. The Pattern 14 rifle did not gain widespread acceptance with the British since it was larger and heavier, held fewer rounds and was slower to cycle than the SMLE. The P14 was well regarded as a sniper rifle (with telescopic and fine adjustment iron sights), but largely disregarded outside of emergency use. During the early part of the second world war it was issued to second and third line units like the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. =US M1917 \\"Enfield\\"= To minimise retooling, the US Army contracted with Winchester and Remington to continue producing a simplified Pattern 14 rifle chambered for US .30-06 ammunition. This weapon was known as the US .30 cal. Model of 1917 (M1917 Enfield rifle). More of these were produced and used by the US Army during the First World War than the official US battle rifle, the Springfield M1903. The M1917 continued in use during World War II as second line and training rifles as the semi- automatic M1 Garands and carbines were phased-in. Many M1917s were sent to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they equipped Home Guard units; these .30-06 rifles had a prominent red stripe painted on the stock to distinguish them from .303 P-14s. Model 1917 rifles were also acquired by Canada and issued in Canada for training, guard duty and home defence. Ross rifle Ross rifle circa WW I The Ross rifle was a straight-pull bolt-action .303 calibre rifle produced in Canada from 1903 until the middle of the First World War, when it was withdrawn from service in Europe due to its unreliability under wartime conditions, and its widespread unpopularity among the soldiers. Since the Ross .303 was a superior, marksman's rifle, its components were machined to extremely fine tolerances which resulted in the weapon clogging too easily in the adverse environment imposed by trench warfare in the First World War. Additionally, British ammunition was too variable in its manufacturing tolerances to be used without careful selection, which was not possible in trench conditions. It was also possible for a careless user to disassemble the bolt for cleaning and then reassemble it with the bolt-head on back to front, resulting in a highly dangerous and sometimes fatal failure of the bolt to lock in the forward position on firing. Snipers, who were able to maintain their weapons carefully, and hand select and measure every round with which they were equipped, were able to use them to maximum effect and retained a considerable fondness for the weapon. Ross rifles were also used by Training units, 2nd and 3rd line units and Home Guard units in the Second World War and many weapons were shipped to Britain after Dunkirk in the face of serious shortages of small arms.  Remington Model 1901  During World War I, the Royal Navy purchased 4,500 Remington Rolling Block rifles in 7mm Mauser from Remington's leftover stock after production had ended, issuing them to the crews of minesweepers and Q-ships.  Rifle, Number 4 aka the Lee Enfield rifle  Lee‚ÄìEnfield No. 4 Mk I* Beginning shortly after the First World War, the SMLE went through a series of experimental changes that resulted in the Rifle, No. 4 Mk I, which was adopted in 1939 just after the beginning of the Second World War. The changes included receiver-mounted aperture rear sights, similar to that of the Pattern 1914 rifle and changed screw threads, making nearly all threaded components incompatible with those of the SMLE (No. 1) rifle. The No. 4 rifle had a heavier barrel, stronger steel in the action body and bolt body and a short \\"grip-less\\" (or \\"spike\\") bayonet that mounted directly to the barrel, rather than to a separate nose cap. The latter was the most prominent visual change. Later several models of bladed bayonets were created. During the Second World War, the British government also contracted with Canadian and US manufacturers (notably Long Branch and Savage) to produce the No. 4 Mk I* rifle. US-manufactured rifles supplied under the Lend Lease program were marked US PROPERTY on the left side of the receiver. Canada's Small Arms Limited at Long Branch made over 900,000. Many of these equipped the Canadian Army and many were supplied to the UK and New Zealand. Over a million No. 4 rifles were built by Stevens-Savage in the United States for the UK between 1941 and 1944 and all were originally marked \\"U.S. PROPERTY\\". Canada and the United States manufactured both the No. 4 MK. I and the simplified No. 4 MK. I*. The UK and Canada converted about 26,000 No. 4 rifles to sniper equipment. The No. 4 rifle has remained on issue until at least 2016 with the Canadian Rangers, still in .303. Some rifles were converted to the NATO 7.62mm calibre for sniping (L42A1) and several versions for target use. L42A1 sniper rifles were used in the Falklands War.  Rifle, Number 5 and further variants  Lee-Enfield No.5 mk1 \\"Jungle Carbine\\" In 1943, trials began on a shortened and lightened No. 4 rifle, leading to the adoption in 1944 of the No. 5 Mk I Rifle, or \\"Jungle Carbine\\", as it is commonly known. The No. 5 rifle was manufactured from 1944 until 1947. The end of the Second World War saw the production of the Rifle, No. 6, an experimental Australian version of the No. 5, and later the Rifle, No. 7, Rifle, No. 8, and Rifle, No. 9, all of which were .22 rimfire trainers. Production of SMLE variants continued until circa 1956 and in small quantities for speciality use until circa 1974. In the mid-1960s, a version was produced for the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge by installing new barrels and new extractors, enlarging the magazine wells slightly, and installing new magazines. This was also done by the Indian rifle factory at Ishapore, which produced a strengthened SMLE in 7.62 mm NATO, as well as .303 SMLEs into the 1980s. Although Mausers and Springfields were being replaced by semi-automatic rifles during the Second World War, the British did not feel the need to replace the faster firing SMLE weapons with the new technology. The no.5 rifle was a favorite among troops serving in the jungles of Malaysia during the Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960) due to its handy size, short length and powerful cartridge that was well suited for penetrating barriers and foliage in jungle warfare. The no.5's extensive use in the Malayan Emergency is where the rifle gained its \\"jungle carbine\\" title.  Rifle, Number 8  A .22 subcalibred No. 8 used for cadet training and match shooting. It used a Parker Hale sight, which is no longer in use in use with the UK cadet forces, replaced with the l114a  Rifle, Number 9 (Enfield EM2) EM-2 bullpup rifle The EM-2 Bullpup Rifle, or \\"Janson rifle\\", was an experimental British assault rifle. It was designed to fire the experimental .280 British round that was being considered to replace the venerable .303 British, re-arming the British and allied forces with their first assault rifles and new machine guns. The EM-2 never entered production due to the United States refusing to standardise on the .280 as \\"lacking power\\", but the bullpup layout was used later in the SA80. A somewhat similar Australian concept was the KAL1 General Purpose Infantry Rifle. L1A1 SLR L1A1 rifle The L1A1 SLR (Self Loading Rifle) is the British version of the FN FAL (Fusil Automatique Leger) ‚Äì Light Automatic Rifle, one of the most famous and widespread military rifle designs of the late 20th century. Developed by the Belgian Fabrique Nationale Company (FN), it was used by some 70 or more countries, and was manufactured in at least 10 countries. The FAL type rifle is no longer in front line service in the developed world, but is still in use in poorer parts of the world. The history of the FAL began circa 1946, when FN began to develop a new assault rifle, chambered for German 7.92√ó33mm Kurz intermediate cartridge. In the late 1940s, the Belgians joined with Britain and selected a British .280 (7√ó43mm) intermediate cartridge for further development. In 1950, both the Belgian FAL prototype and the British EM-2 bullpup assault rifles were tested by the US Army against other rifle designs. The EM-2 performed well and the FAL prototype greatly impressed the Americans, but the idea of the intermediate cartridge was at that moment incomprehensible to them, and the United States insisted on a \\"reduced full-size\\" cartridge, the 7.62 NATO, as a standard in 1953‚Äì1954. Despite the British Defence minister announcing the intention to adopt the EM-2 and the intermediate cartridge, Winston Churchill personally opposed the EM-2 and .280 cartridge in the belief that a split in NATO should be avoided, and that the US would adopt the FAL in 7.62 as the T48. The first 7.62 mm FALs were ready in 1953. Britain adopted the FAL in 1957 designating it the L1A1 SLR, and produced their own rifles at the RSAF Enfield and BSA factories. Canada also used the FN, designated the FNC1 and FNC1A1, and like Britain, retained the semi-automatic- only battle rifle well after other countries forces turned to full automatic assault rifles such as the M16 and AK-47. Australia still uses the L1A1 for ceremonial use. L64/65 During the 1970s, Enfield engineers designed an assault rifle to replace the L1A1 in the Bullpup configuration but chambered in the .190 calibre (4.85 mm). This rifle had better range and ballistics than the 5.56√ó45mm NATO although it retained the same cartridge, necked-down for the new calibre. Like the previous EM-2, It was a bullpup and also cancelled due to NATO standardisation. However, the L64 was later chambered in 5.56√ó45mm NATO as the XL70 and is the main rifle that formed the basis of the SA80. Rifle 5.56mm L85 (SA80) L85A2 IW (SA80) \\"bullpup\\" Bullpup design creatively decreases total weapon length compared with standard assault rifles. It is easy to use not only on the battlefield, but also in areas with limited space, such as armoured personnel carriers. In 1951, the British officially adopted the EM-2 bullpup design as the \\"Rifle, Automatic, No.9 Mk.1\\". However, American insistence on the use of 7.62√ó51 NATO cartridges as the NATO standard meant that the rifle, which used 7 mm rounds, was shelved and the Belgian FN FAL rifle adopted. It was expected that the US would also adopt the FAL then under trial as the T48 but they selected the M14. Another Enfield attempt in the 1970s was the L64/65. Britain started a programme to find a family of related weapons to replace the L1A1 battle rifle and the Bren gun titled \\"Small Arms for the 1980s\\" or SA80. The L85 is designed for the 5.56√ó45mm NATO cartridge. The gas operated action has a short stroke gas piston, located above the barrel with its own return spring. The gas system has a three position gas regulator, one position for a normal firing, second for a firing in adverse conditions, and the third for launching rifle grenades (gas port is shut off). The L85A1 was improved in 1997 after constant complaints from the troops. The main problems were difficult maintenance and low reliability. These problems led British troops to nickname the weapon the \\"civil servant\\", as, in their estimation, you could not make it work and could not fire it. Improvements were made during 2000 ‚Äì 2002 when 200,000 of the existing 320,000 L85A1 Automatic Rifles were upgraded. Improvements were made to the working parts (cocking handle, firing pin etc.), gas parts and magazines. The improved rifle is named L85A2. During active service, the A2 can be fitted with a 40 mm grenade launcher, a light attachment and a laser sighting device. Sighting systems include the SUSAT (pictured) with 4x magnification and a trilux gas-filled conical reticule or iron sight consisting of a foresight and rear sight with adjustable rear sight for low light conditions. In light of operational experience gained during Operation Herrick in Afghanistan and Operation Telic in Iraq, a number of additions to the L85A2 have entered service as Urgent Operational Requirements but over time have become standard. The most noticeable addition has been that of a Picatinny Rail Interface System designed and manufactured by US company Daniel Defense, which replaces the original green plastic front furniture. The RIS system often sports rubber rail covers in coyote brown colour and a GripPod vertical down grip / bipod unit. The Oerlikon Contraves LLM-01 laser and sight combo has been standard for some time, but a new laser/light unit by Rheinmetall has been recently cleared for service. Two different x4 optical infantry sights have seen service in addition to the SUSAT. The Trijicon TA-31 ACoG with a red dot CQB sight was purchased as a UOR and latterly a replacement for the SUSAT has entered service namely the Elcan Specter OS4X also with a red dot CQB sight mounted on it. Additionally, an alternative flash eliminator can be fitted, an open ended four pronged design by Surefire. The Surefire flash eliminator gives improved flash elimination, can accept the standard bayonet and also accommodate a Surefire sound suppressor. The Surefire flash eliminator is only for operational use it being incompatible with the standard L85A2 Blank Firing Attachment. Polymer magazines manufactured by Magpul called the EMAG have also been purchased to replace steel magazines in operational environments slightly easing the infantryman's weight burden. It is anticipated that the SA80 will remain in front-line service well into the 2020s. Rifle, 5.56mm L119A1 The Colt Canada (formerly Diemaco) manufactured C8SFW, a variant of the Canadian Forces C8 carbine, is used by UK Special Forces, elements of the Parachute Regiment and the Royal Military Police. In 2019, it was announced that the carbine would completely replace the L85 in service with the Royal Marines. Rifle, 7.62mm L129A1 Sharpshooter Rifle L129A1 Lewis Machine & Tool's LM308MWS, was chosen by the MoD in 2010 to meet a ¬£1.5 million urgent operational requirement in the Afghanistan conflict for a semi-automatic 7.62mm rifle with excellent accuracy, whose rate of fire and robustness made them usable within infantry squads, not just by specialised sniper teams. It had to demonstrate lethality in the 500‚Äì800-metre range, which was not uncommon in Afghanistan. More than 400 of the semi-automatic Sharpshooter rifles have been bought. It is the first new Infantry combat rifle to be issued to troops for more than 20 years.  L96 and L115 Sniper Rifles  Royal Marines snipers displaying their L115A1 rifles. The L96 is a sniper rifle produced by Accuracy International derived from their PM rifle which was designed by Olympic marksman Malcolm Cooper. This weapon was adopted into British Service in the early 1980s as a replacement for the Lee‚ÄìEnfield L42. The L96 in turn was replaced by the Accuracy International .338 Lapua Magnum L115A3 rifle.

It states that if the sum of the reciprocals of the members of a set A of positive integers diverges, then A contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Formally, the conjecture states that if A is a large set in the sense that :: sum_{nin A} frac{1}{n}  = infty, then A contains arithmetic progressions of any given length, meaning subsets of the form {a,a{+}c,a{+}2c,ldots,a{+}kc}subset A for arbitrarily large k. History In 1936, Erd≈ës and Tur√°n made the weaker conjecture that any set of integers with positive natural density contains infinitely many 3 term arithmetic progressions.. This was proven by Klaus Roth in 1952, and generalized to arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions by Szemer√©di in 1975 in what is now known as Szemer√©di's theorem. In a 1976 talk titled \\"To the memory of my lifelong friend and collaborator Paul Tur√°n,\\" Paul Erd≈ës offered a prize of US$3000 for a proof of this conjecture.Problems in number theory and Combinatorics, in Proceedings of the Sixth Manitoba Conference on Numerical Mathematics (Univ.

Progress and related results Erd≈ës' conjecture on arithmetic progressions can be viewed as a stronger version of Szemer√©di's theorem. Because the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, the Green-Tao theorem on arithmetic progressions is a special case of the conjecture. The weaker claim that A must contain infinitely many arithmetic progressions of length 3 is a consequence of an improved bound in Roth's theorem, which appears as the main result in a 2020 preprint by Bloom and Sisask. The former strongest bound in Roth's theorem is due to Bloom. See also * Problems involving arithmetic progressions * List of sums of reciprocals References *P.

Lesner, a Democratic Virginia State Senator who had earlier represented Norfolk County and the City of Norfolk, beginning in 1908. In February 2016, a move was afoot, supported by the local newspaper, to rename the bridge in honor of US Navy Admiral Jeremiah Denton or change it to its commonly known name of Lynnhaven Inlet Bridge. Local residents and the Lesner family oppose the change and a public poll resulted in no support for the name change. Stephen Mansfield wrote in the book \\"Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach, A Pictorial History,\\" (page 151) that the General Assembly voted to name the bridge after State Senator John A. Lesner in recognition for his service on the State Highway Commission. Bridge replacement In 2014 the City of Virginia Beach began a project to replace the Lesner Bridge with expanded spans that each have two travel lanes and a wide multi-use path. The new bridge will be capable of six total lanes in the future. Construction on the new westbound span started in June 2014, and was opened to traffic in November 2016. In December 2016, eastbound traffic shifted to the new westbound bridge while the existing spans were demolished and construction began on the new eastbound bridge. On December 12th, 2018 the new Lesner Bridge was officially open to the public.

It was founded by Stanley Zbigniew Strychacki. It was a hangout and venue for performance and visual artists and musicians, including The Cramps, Madonna, Keith Haring, Cyndi Lauper, Charles Busch, Klaus Nomi, The B-52s, RuPaul, Futura 2000, Kenny Scharf, Frank Holliday, Staceyjoy Elkin, John Sex, Wendy Wild, April Palmieri, The Fleshtones, The Fuzztones, Joey Arias, Lypsinka, Michael Musto, Marc Shaiman, Scott Wittman, Fab Five Freddy, Jacek Tylicki, and to a lesser extent, Jean-Michel Basquiat. Creation It was started in the basement of the Holy Cross Polish National Church on St. Mark's. Ann Magnuson, who managed the club and hosted events, described it as home to \\"pointy-toed hipsters, girls in rockabilly petticoats, spandex pants, and thrift-store stiletto heels...suburban refugees who had run away from home to find a new family...who liked the things we liked - Devo, Duchamp, and William S.

He curated the Black Light Show there, an early show of his own works (1981), and an exhibition of Kenny Scharf's hand customized appliances. Besides Magnuson's input, the main contribution to the Club 57 style was from School of Visual Arts undergraduate students (including Haring, Holliday, Scharf and Sex), who used it as a playground. ‚ÄúAt Club 57 there were drugs and promiscuity‚Äîit was one big orgy family. Sometimes I‚Äôd look around and say, ‚ÄúOh, my God! I‚Äôve had sex with everybody in this room!‚Äù It was just the spirit of the times‚Äîand it was before AIDS\\" remembers Scharf, \\"Everybody there was either living together or sleeping together.\\" Drew Staub agreed. Scharf recalls that \\"Ann Magnuson may have been twenty-four, but she was like our mom.\\" Jean-Michel Basquiat fell out with Kenny Scharf, in part over Club 57: \\"esthetically I really hated Club 57.

Other contributors included Shawn McQuate the Great aka AMMO, dancer, performance-artist and designer. Stacey Elkin and Shawn were known as the fashion designers of the club, and made costumes for many of the Club 57 performers, like Magnuson, Scharf, and model and artist Kitty Brophy. McQuate the Great/Shawn AMMO was John Sex's boyfriend for two years during the early club days. McQuate did several happenings, including having 50 performance artists performing at the same time, in Universal Interaction 1981. Also, Ande Whyland, Photog., Robert Carrithers, photog., Minn Thometz- Sanchez, dancer/personality, and so many others played a vital role in the clubs aesthetic.

The Medical News. May 24, 2004. Her research centers on the study of the three-dimensional structures of proteins related to Class I MHC, or Major Histocompatibility Complex, proteins of the immune system and proteins involved in the immune responses to viruses . Bjorkman is most well known as a pioneer in the field of structural biology. HLA-A2 molecule; peptide antigen groove (starred) on top domain Bjorkman earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry at the University of Oregon, under the guidance of Hayes Griffith and Patricia Jost. She received her PhD in biochemistry at Harvard University in 1984, where she worked in the laboratory of Don Wiley. She stayed on in Wiley's lab in a postdoctoral position where she ultimately solved the first crystal structure of an MHC protein - the HLA-A2 human histocompatibility antigen. This work was published in 1987, first at 3.5√Ö resolution (PDB entry 1HLA) and then refined at 2.6√Ö (PDB entry 3HLA). Bjorkman continued her postdoctoral research at Stanford University in the laboratory of Mark Davis, studying the T-cell receptors that recognize antigens presented in the binding groove of MHC proteins. In 1989, she joined the Biology faculty at the California Institute of Technology as an associate professor. She earned tenure as an associate professor in 1995 and was promoted to full professor in 1998. She was an HHMI investigator from 1989‚Äì2015. The Bjorkman laboratory is interested in immune recognition of viral pathogens in order to develop improved therapeutics against rapidly-evolving viruses such as HIV-1. They use X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemistry to study pathogen envelope glycoproteins and host immune response proteins. Using structural information and alternate antibody architectures, they are engineering antibody-based reagents with increased potency and breadth. They are also investigating the structural correlates of broad and potent antibody-mediated neutralization of HIV-1 to better understand what leads to naturally-occurring broad and potent antibodies. In related work, they use 3D imaging techniques such as electron tomography and fluorescent microscopy to investigate HIV/SIV infection in animal and human tissues. Pamela Bjorkman's Erd≈ës number is two, based on publication of a structural and mathematical analysis of the symmetry of insect ferritin with mathematician Peter Hamburger. Bjorkman is married to the neurobiologist Kai Zinn, also a full professor at Caltech. Bjorkman and Zinn have two children.

It was founded in Sudan by Ahmed Hassan Musa, an Islamic fundamentalist close to the Muslim Brotherhood who was leader of the General Union of the Children of Chad (Union G√©n√©rale des Fils du Tchad or UGFT), an Islamic traditionalist party composed of exiles in Sudan, whose adherents were always recruited mostly among Ouaddaians. On September 7, Mussa with his UGFT followers created the Liberation Front of Chad (FLT), the first insurgent group formed to fight the Tombalbaye Regime; that the times were ready for an insurgent group was fully understood a month later, when the Mangalm√© riots started the civil war. The next year the FLT united with Ibrahim Abatcha's Chadian National Union (UNT) at the Congress of Nyala in Sudan between June 19 and 22. The new organization created was called National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT); Abatcha was secretary-general and it was governed by thirty- member committee equally composed of UNT and FLT members. A part of the FLT under the leadership of Mussa restaked its authonomy already in late 1966; based in Sudan, it operated on the Chad-Sudan border, but never represented a true danger for the Chadian government, especially when confronted with the FROLINAT. When Tombalbaye was overthrown in the 1975 coup, and F√©lix Malloum's new government made overtures to the insurgent groups, the FLT was one of the few that answered and came to terms with the central authorities in 1976, signing the end of the FLT's armed fight.

VisitScotland also manages a number of quality grading schemes for tourist accommodation and attractions. The organisation also operates the VisitScotland.com website which provides bookings and information service for visitors to Scotland. From 2001 this website was operated as a public-private partnership venture, though this venture (and the website) was brought back into public ownership in 2008. Aims and operation VisitScotland's primary aim is to market Scotland as a tourism destination, which it does through advertising and promotion as well as encouraging press articles on Scotland and what it has to offer the business or consumer visitor. The organisation also seeks to work with the tourism industry in Scotland to maintain standards in visitor attractions and accommodation provision. It does this through a number of specific quality grading schemes. VisitScotland also runs the Thistle Awards, which are awarded to the best tourism businesses each year. Website VisitScotland.com is the official website of VisitScotland. The website acts as a bookings and information service for visitors to Scotland. Accommodation availability information, as well as more general information about Scotland, is provided from the www.visitscotland.com domain. VisitScotland.com was initially the trading name of eTourism Ltd, a private limited company set up by a public-private partnership. In 2003 the IT services group SchlumbergerSema was taken over by Atos. There was a major restructuring in July 2006 that saw VisitScotland increase its stake from 25% to 36%, Austrian booking specialist Tiscover took a 35% share and ATOS reduced its stake from 60% to 7%. Partnerships UK Ltd had also been shareholders. The ownership of VisitScotland.com became a divisive issue within the Scottish tourism industry. A number of accommodation providers lodged a petition with the Scottish Parliament to return the group to public ownership, arguing that the use of public money to fund the parent company eTourism Ltd was disrupting competition, an assertion which eTourism unconditionally rejected. In 2008, a Scottish Parliament inquiry led by Tavish Scott considered some of the problems associated with the website and made the recommendation that Scottish Government find additional resources to resolve these. On 7 November 2008, it was announced that ownership of VisitScotland.com was to be transferred solely to VisitScotland, with ¬£1.2 million of funds being used to purchase shares from all other shareholders.

Originally it was called Signum; the name Integra was added later. It transmits data inductively and is simple, robust and reliable also in snow. How it works The locomotives have three sending and receiving magnets and there are two trackside magnets near the signals. Integra-Signum asks the train driver to confirm distant signals that show stop and distant or home signals that show caution. If he does not confirm or passes a home signal that shows stop, the train is stopped automatically. This is achieved by interrupting the power supply to the motors and applying the emergency brake. The locomotive's sending magnet is a strong permanent magnet, which induces a current in the receiving magnet in the middle of the track, if the signal's short-circuit contact is closed. The receiving magnet on the locomotive consists of two magnet field detectors, which detect the signal's state according to polarity and timing of the magnetic field emitted by the second magnet outside the track: Integra-Signum magnets on a Be 6/8 III \\"Crocodile\\" Stop (home signals): positive - negative, concurrent Caution (distant signals): negative - positive, concurrent Caution (home signal): positive - positive, not concurrent Because Integra-Signum can only stop a train when it's \\"too late\\", i.e. after the red signal, it is not sufficient if there is an obstacle less than the braking distance away from the signal, which is especially a problem with fast trains. To address this issue, Zugbeeinflussung ZUB has been introduced. Despite that Integra-Signum aims to prevent accidents, there was also an accident caused by it. In 1959, an Integra-Signum magnet mounted on a SBB-CFF-FFS RBe 540 EMU tore out a wooden sleeper on a level crossing near Gland, which led to the derailment of the entire train at 125 km/h.  Phasing out  By 2017 Switzerland had almost completed the migration to ETCS Level 1. Integra-Signum will remain in service for a few years more on a small number of special lines; one of these is the Uetliberg railway line, which will first be converted from DC to AC electrification. From beginning 2018, new vehicles running on the Swiss network do not need anymore the class B system SIGNUM and ZUB.

The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways on behalf of the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive until the privatisation of British Railways. The line was electrified in 1960 (as the first stage of the West Coast Main Line electrification project) - since then, the station has acted as a terminus for some local services from the Manchester direction. Both platforms are bi- directionally signalled to facilitate this and there are turnback sidings provided close to the station to allow empty stock to be stabled clear of the main line.

Biography His full name was Simon ben Azzai, to which sometimes the title \\"Rabbi\\" is prefixed. But, in spite of his great learning, this title did not rightfully belong to him, for he remained all his life in the ranks of the \\"talmidim\\" or \\"talmidei hakhamim\\" (pupils or disciples of the wise). Ben Azzai and Ben Zoma were considered in the tannaitic school-tradition as the highest representatives of this degree in the hierarchy of learning.Tosefta Kiddushin 3:9; Bavli Kiddushin 49b; Brachot 57b; Yerushalmi Ma'aser Sheni 2 (53d); Bavli Sanhedrin 17b Ben Azzai is especially named as an eminent example of a \\"pupil who is worthy of the hora'ah,\\" of the right of independent judgment in questions of religious law.Horayot 2b Ben 'Azzai stood in close relation to the leaders of the school of Jabneh. On the same day, he (1) handed down \\"from the mouth of 72 elders\\" present a halakhic decision (which was accepted in Jabneh on the day when Eleazar ben Azariah was elected president in the place of Gamaliel II Yadayim 4:2; Zevachim 1:3) and also (2) resolved that the books Kohelet and Shir ha- Shirim were as sacred as the other Scriptures, thereby officially closing the collection of Biblical writings or canon.Yadayim 3:5 Chief among Ben Azzai's teachers was Joshua ben Hananiah, whose opinions he expounded,Parah 1:1 proved to be correct,Yevamot 4:13 or defended against Akiva.Yoma 2:3; Ta'anit 4:4; Tosefta Shevuot 2:13 Akiva himself was not really Ben Azzai's teacher, although the latter occasionally calls him so, and once even regrets that he did not stand in closer relation as pupil to Akiva;Ned. 74b and he expressed the same regret in regard to Ishmael ben Elisha.Chullin 71a In his halakhic opinions and Biblical exegesis, as well as in other sayings, Ben Azzai follows Akiva; and from the tone in which he speaks of Akiva in the discourses that have been handed down, the Amoraim concluded that his relations with Akiva were both those of pupil and of colleague.Yerushalmi Bava Batra 9 (17b); Bavli Bava Batra 158b; Yerushalmi Shekalim 3 (47b); Yerushalmi Rosh Hashana 1 (56d) = Piety and devotion to study = Ben Azzai's most prominent characteristic was the extraordinary assiduity with which he pursued his studies. It was said of him afterward, \\"At the death of Ben Azzai the last industrious man died\\".So·π≠ah 9:15 A later traditionMidr. Hallel says of the zealous studies of Ben Azzai and Akiva (by way of reference to Psalms 114:8) that in their perceptive faculty both had been as hard as rock; but, because they exerted themselves so greatly in their studies, God opened for the man entrance into the Torah, so that Ben Azzai could explain even those things in the Halakah that the schools of Shammai and Hillel had not understood. His love of study induced Ben Azzai to remain unmarried, although he himself preached against celibacy, and even was betrothed to Rabbi Akiva's daughter, who waited for years for him to marry her, as her mother had waited for Akiva.Ketuvot 63a When Eleazar ben Azariah reproved him for this contradiction between his life and his teachings, he replied: \\"What shall I do? My soul clings lovingly to the Torah; let others contribute to the preservation of the race\\".Tosefta Yevamot 8:4; Bavli ib. 63b; Genesis Rabbah 34; compare So·π≠ah 4b. Another characteristic of Ben Azzai was his great piety. It was said, \\"He who has seen Ben Azzai in his dreams is himself on the way to piety\\".Berachot 57b. Thanks to this piety he could, without injury to his soul, devote himself to theosophic speculations, when he, like Ben Zoma, Elisha ben Abuyah, and Akiva, entered, as tradition has it, into the garden (\\"pardes\\") of the esoteric doctrine. Tradition says of him: \\"He beheld the mysteries of the garden and died; of him Scripture says:Psalms 116:15 Precious in the eyes of God is the death of his pious ones.\\"Hagigah 14b With reference to this verse, Ben Azzai himself had taught that God shows to the pious, near the hour of their death, the rewards awaiting them.Genesis Rabbah 62 Other sayings of his concerning the hour of death have been handed down.Avot of Rabbi Natan 25 According to a tradition not entirely trustworthy, Ben Azzai was among the first victims of the persecutions under Hadrian; his name, therefore, is found on a list of the ten martyrs.Lamentations Rabbah 2:2 = His Reputation = Ben Azzai's posthumous fame was extraordinary. The greatest amora of Israel (Rav Johanan) and the greatest amora of Babylonia (Rav) each said, in order to mark their authority as teachers of the Law: \\"Here I am a Ben Azzai\\".Yerushalmi Bikkurim 2 (65a); Yerushalmi Peah 6 (19c) The name of Ben Azzai is applied in the same sense by the great Babylonian amora AbayeSo·π≠ah 45a; Kiddushin 20a; Arakhin 30b and Raba.Eruvin 29a An aggadic legend from Israel relates of him the following: Teachings Many teachings of Ben Azzai's, with and without Biblical foundation, have been preserved. Two of these were included in Pirkei Avot.Avot 4:2,3 After a saying of Ben Azzai, at the beginning of the third chapter of Derekh Eretz Rabbah, this little book (which began originally with that chapter) is called \\"Perek Ben Azzai\\".Rashi to Berakhot 22a; Tosafot to Eruvin 53b In a teaching that recalls a fundamental thought of Akiva, Ben Azzai gives the characteristic features of a kind of deterministic view of the world: \\"By your name they shall call you, at the place where you belong they shall see you, what is yours they shall give to you; no man touches that which is destined for his neighbor; and no government infringes even by a hair's breadth upon the time marked for another government\\".Yoma 38a etc. Following Hillel, Akiva had declared the commandment \\"you shall love thy neighbor like yourself\\"Leviticus 19:18 to be the greatest fundamental commandment of the Jewish doctrine; Ben Azzai, in reference to this, said that a still greater principle was found in the Scriptural verse, \\"This is the book of the generations of man [Adam]. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God He made him\\".Genesis 6:1; Sifra, Kedoshim, 4; Yerushalmi Nedarim 9 41c; Genesis Rabbah 24 The commandment to love God with all the soulDeuteronomy 6:5 Ben Azzai explained in the same manner as Akiva: \\"Love him even to the last breath of the soul!\\".Sifre, Deuteronomy 32 Several of Ben Azzai's aggadic teachings, having been called forth by those of Akiva, are introduced by the words, \\"I do not wish to oppose the interpretation of my master, but will only add to his words\\".Sifra, Vayi·∏≥ra, 2; Mekhilta, Bo, Introduction Ben Azzai's observations on sacrificesSifre, Numbers 143 are obviously directed against Gnosticism. In opposition to the Gnostic doctrine that the laws of sacrifice could have originated only with a secondary god (the demiurge, who is merely just, not beneficent), Ben Azzai notes that not any one of the various names of God in Judaism used in connection with the sacrificial laws, but precisely the distinctive name, the Tetragrammaton, in which especially the goodness of God is emphasized, in order that the \\"minim\\" (disbelievers) might not have an opportunity to prove their views by the Bible. Ben Azzai's symbolic interpretation of the first word of Lamentations (◊ê◊ô◊õ◊î) is also polemical and probably directed against Pauline Christianity. He holds that the gematria of the letters of this word indicates that the Israelites were not exiled until they had denied the one God (◊ê), the ten commandments (◊ô), the law of circumcision, given to the twentieth generation after Adam (◊õ), and the five (◊î) books of the Torah.Lamentations Rabbah 1:1  Quotes  *A mitzvah draws in its wake another mitzvah, while a transgression draws in its wake another transgression.Pirkei Avot 4:2 *Despise no man, nor ignore any matter; for there is not a man that has not his hour, nor is there a thing that has not its place.Pirkei Avot 4:3 In popular culture In Jorge Luis Borges's story \\"Three Versions of Judas\\", the narrator mentions that Simeon ben Azzai saw the Garden of Eden and died.

His early poems, which began appearing in the 1970s in such magazines as Poetry, The Southern Review, and X. J. Kennedy's Counter/Measures, are said to have anticipated and contributed to the revival of traditional verse associated with the New Formalism.Brogan, T. V. F. \\"New Formalism.\\" The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics, eds. Alex Preminger and T. V. F. Brogan. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1993, p. 835.

Retrieved 22 February 2014. Notwithstanding his reservations about the term, Steele's poetry is more strictly \\"formal\\" than the work of most New Formalists in that he rarely uses inexact rhymes or metrical substitutions, and is sparing in his use of enjambment.Leithauser, Brad. \\"The Strictest Line.\\" TLS, February 19, 1988, p. 180. In addition to four collections of poems, Steele is the author of two books on prosody: Missing Measures, a study of the literary and historical background of modern free verse; and All the Fun's in How You Say a Thing, an introduction to English versification. Steele was an original faculty member of the West Chester University Poetry Conference, and received its Robert Fitzgerald Prosody Award in 2004.  Education  Born in Burlington, Vermont in 1948, Steele attended the city's public schools. At an early age, he became interested in poetry, including that of Robert Frost, who was appointed the state's Poet Laureate in 1961, and William Shakespeare, several of whose plays were staged each summer at a Shakespeare festival at the University of Vermont in Burlington.\\"Timothy Steele in Conversation with Cynthia Haven.\\" Three Poets in Conversation: Dick Davis, Rachel Hadas, Timothy Steele. London: Between the Lines, 2006, pp. 103-06. Steele received his baccalaureate degree in English (1970) from Stanford University and a master's (1972) and doctorate (1977) in English and American Literature from Brandeis University, where he studied with the well-known poet and Renaissance scholar J. V. Cunningham, a collected edition of whose poems Steele would later edit.Steele, Timothy. \\"The Forms of Poetry.\\" Brandeis Review (Summer 1992), pp. 29-30.  Career  From 1975 to 1977 Steele served as a Jones Lecturer in poetry at Stanford. Subsequently, he held lectureships at UCLA and UC Santa Barbara. He is an emeritus professor in the English Department at California State University, Los Angeles, where he taught from 1987 until 2012.http://instructional1.calstatela.edu/tsteele/TSpage3/CVoriginal.html  Poetry  Steele's poems fuse traditional verse forms with contemporary subjects and, in Kennedy's words, \\"express appreciation both for the life of the mind and for the sensuous world.\\"Kennedy, X.

Library Journal, April 15, 1979, p. 956. Of his second book, Sapphics against Anger and Other Poems (1986), Kathryn Hellerstein wrote in Partisan Review, \\"Steele's formal range is impressive.

Their subjects, evoked in exquisite imagery, are entryways to noumena, the pure abstractions of the mind.\\"Hellerstein, Kathryn. \\"Pleasures of Restriction.\\" Partisan Review (Autumn 1989), p. 679. Speaking in The Sewanee Review of The Color Wheel (1994), R. S.

Critics have pointed to Yvor Winters and Cunningham as having influenced Steele's work and have noted his particular affinity with Frost. As Donald G. Sheehy says in his essay \\"Measure for Measure: The Frostian Classicism of Timothy Steele\\": \\"Steele recalls Frost in his subtle mastery of form, in his philosophical and aesthetic moderation, in his sympathetic but unsentimental attention to the natural world and to the vicissitudes of love and marriage, and in the gently incisive wit with which he meets human foible, public and private.\\"Sheehy, Donald G. \\"Measure for Measure: The Frostian Classicism of Timothy Steele.\\" The Robert Frost Journal (Fall 1995) p. 73. In an interview in 1991 with the Los Angeles Times, Steele explained his goals in using traditional poetic structure: \\"Well-used meter and rhyme can create a sense of liveliness and a symmetry and surprise that can produce delight and pleasure for the reader ... I want to say something important. And I would hope the reader would be interested in it. But I also hope to give the reader pleasure.\\"Gordon, Larry. \\"Poetry's Purist.\\" Los Angeles Times, June 10, 1991, Section B, p. 1.  Works about versification  Steele's two books on versification have attracted considerable attention. Missing Measures: Modern Poetry and the Revolt Against Meter examines the ideas and conditions that led many poets, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, to challenge poetry's traditional principles of rhythmical organization and to develop new forms of verse without the regular units of measure that had characterized earlier verse. Among other topics, the book explores the legacy of Aristotle's dual view of poetry as, on the one hand, a rhetorical art of metrical speech and, on the other hand, a mimetic art that does not necessarily involve meter. The book also examines the shift in Romantic aesthetics from the belief that artists objectively represent the world outside them to the belief that they subjectively express their inner feelings. Another subject of discussion is the increasing prominence in imaginative literature, in the eighteenth century and afterwards, of prose forms like the novel. Yet another topic is the sense among modern poets and artists that the physical sciences have moved into the central position in culture and that the arts should, to keep up with science, adopt its methods and become \\"experimental.\\" And the book documents the way a number of leading modern poets came to feel that meter itself was inextricably bound up with the dated idioms of Victorian verse and that to break with or reform Victorian style it was also necessary to break with or reform meter. More specifically, the book observes how free verse‚Äîoriginally regarded by the great early modern poets as a temporary expedient to bring new life into poetry and as a challenge to poets to think freshly about their art‚Äîramified into increasingly divergent modes and became, over the course of the twentieth century, a predominant means of poetic expression. Reviewers differed sharply in their judgments about Missing Measures. Some praised the book for its depth of historical information and analysis and considered reasonable Steele's concluding argument on behalf of preserving metrical tradition. Writing in the TLS, Clive Wilmer spoke of Steele as \\"a considerable scholar ... moving with ease across two-and-a-half millennia of critical thought on the subject of metre\\" and summarized the book as \\"wise and engrossing.\\"Wilmer, Clive. \\"A Straitjacket or a Trilby?\\" TLS, February 1, 1991, p. 19. In contrast, other reviewers criticized Missing Measures as involving or implying a broadly and unwarrantedly negative assessment of the free verse tradition. Meg Schoerke, writing for The American Scholar, stated, \\"According to Steele, free verse results in a wholly subjective poetry that is divorced from human experience, solipsistic, and therefore immoral.\\"Schoerke, Meg. \\"Measure for Measure.\\" The American Scholar (Summer 1991), p. 462. Yet even reviewers who did not wholly share Steele's views appear to have felt that his book revealed and illuminated aspects of modern poetry that had been overlooked or insufficiently considered. Chris McCully commented in PN Review, \\"If it [Missing Measures] contains things to quarrel with, it also contains far more to think about, absorb, interpret, and make use of.\\"McCully, Chris. \\"Missing Measures and the Matter of Metre.\\" PN Review (January/February 1991), p. 45. Steele himself has said that he does not object to free verse--\\"Free verse,\\" he maintains, \\"is just as much poetry as verse is\\"Steele. Contribution to \\"Syposium: What We Talk about When We Talk about Form.\\" Think Journal (2011), p. 14.‚Äîbut to the idea that it has superseded meter and rendered it obsolete. Though acknowledging he feels a special interest in metrical composition, he has insisted that his preference \\"is personal and aesthetic, however; I have never imagined that it provided me with access to cultural or spiritual virtue. And despite allegations to the contrary about Missing Measures, I have never said that vers libre is somehow wrong and immoral or that meter is somehow right and pure. The experimental school of Pound, Eliot, Lawrence, and Williams has its own beauties and achievements. But we can prize them justly and build on them, it seems to me, only if we retain a knowledge and appreciation of the time-tested principles of standard versification. Free verse cannot be free, unless there is something for it to be free of.\\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/timothy-steele. Retrieved 8 December 2011. Less controversial is Steele's nuts-and-bolts explanation of versification, All the Fun's in How You Say a Thing, of which Robert B. Shaw said in Poetry Magazine, \\"Steele's choice of examples, drawn from the entire range of English-language poetry since Chaucer, indicates an impressive breadth of learning and a lively catholicity of taste ... This book defines a notably high standard for future writers in the field to emulate.\\"Shaw, Robert B. \\"Prosody for the People.\\" Poetry (September 2000), p. 347.  Influence  Despite differing opinions about Steele's advocacy of meter, observers seem to agree that his work has influenced the development of recent American verse. Kevin Walzer wrote in 1996 in The Tennessee Quarterly, \\"His achievement as a poet ... is such that he differs from the mainstream far less today than when he began writing--an important marker of the range and substance of his influence. In short, he has helped to change the course of the stream.\\"Walzer, Kevin. \\"The Poetry of Timothy Steele.\\" The Tennessee Quarterly (Winter 1996), p. 17. Joseph O. Aimone noted in 2003 in The Dictionary of Literary Biography, \\"Readers of poetry with a feel for formal verse can already find an interesting and gratifying wealth of invention in Steele's three volumes of poems. Those who care for explanations of versification and poetic history will find his two volumes of prose useful and readable.

Goodby, Silverstein & Partners is now part of the Omnicom Group, Inc., an advertising holding company. The agency is based in San Francisco, CA. In 2015, after 32 years, Rich Silverstein and Jeff Goodby announced they were passing on the reigns of the creative department to Margaret Johnson, Executive Creative Director and Eric Kallman, Executive Creative Director. Margaret and Eric were also named to Adweek's Creative 100 list in 2015. Derek Robson has been the President and Managing Partner since 2005. The firm supported the California Milk Processors Board and GSP initiated the Got Milk? campaign in 1993. For Elizabeth Arden, GSP created Britney's fantasy reality to promote her Curious fragrance. As an offshoot of the popular Budweiser Frogs campaign, GSP introduced the Budweiser Lizards, Frank and Louie, during the 1998 Super Bowl with the spot entitled, \\"Bad Day to be a Frog,\\" in which the frogs were electrocuted by the jealous lizards. Inspired by the famous Budweiser Clydesdales, the \\"Born a Donkey\\" commercial came from the perspective of a donkey who always wanted to be a Clydesdale.

The complex relationships between written and spoken literature in some societies can make this definition hard to maintain. Background Oral poetry is sometimes considered to include any poetry which is performed live. In many cultures, oral poetry overlaps with, or is identical with, song. Meanwhile, although the term oral etymologically means 'to do with the mouth', in some cultures oral poetry is also performed by other means, such as talking drums in some African cultures. Oral poetry exists most clearly within oral cultures, but it can survive, and indeed flourish, in highly literate cultures. Oral poetry differs from oral literature in general because oral literature encompasses linguistic registers which are not considered poetry. In most oral literature, poetry is defined by the fact that it conforms to metrical rules; examples of non-poetic oral literature in Western culture include some jokes, speeches and storytelling. An influential movement in the study of oral poetry, both because it helped to bring oral poetry within the realms of academic literary study and because it illuminated the ways in which poetic form and orality interrelate, has been the oral-formulaic theory developed by Milman Parry and Albert Lord. This theory showed how stock phrases could enable poets to improvise verse. One consequence of Parry and Lord's work is that orally improvised poetry (as opposed to poetry which is composed without the use of writing but then memorised and performed later) is sometimes seen as the example par excellence of oral poetry. Examples of orally improvised poetry are the epics of the Serbo-Croatian guslars studied by Parry and Lord, Basque bertsolaritza, and freestyle rap. Much oral poetry, however, is memorised verbatim ‚Äì though the precise wording, particularly of words which are not essential to sense or metre, do tend to change from one performance to another, and one performer to another.Rubin, David C. Memory in Oral Traditions: The Cognitive Psychology of Epic, Ballads, and Counting-out Rhymes. New York: Oxford University Press, 1995. Although the original composition of a memorised oral poem may have been undertaken without the use of writing, memorial traditions sometimes originate in a written text. Likewise, memorised oral poems can come to be written down, leading to a situation in which written versions in turn influence memorised versions. Prominent examples of memorised oral poetry are some nursery rhymes, ballads and medieval Scandinavian skaldic verse. Regional and national traditions Poetical improvisation is a living tradition in many parts of the world.

It is best known from two 1967 releases: a pop hit single by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, which reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 39 Easy Listening, and a country hit single by Johnny Cash and June Carter, which reached number two on the Billboard Country Singles chart and has become more appreciated by non-country audiences in recent years as a result of Cash's continued popularity and its use in the 2011 film The Help. Background Actress Gaby Rodgers is cited as co-author of \\"Jackson\\", because Leiber used his then-wife's name as a pseudonym in writing the song with Wheeler. First recorded in 1963 by Wheeler, he explains the evolution of the song, and Leiber's contribution: > 'Jackson' came to me when I read the script for Edward Albee's Who's Afraid > of Virginia Woolf (I was too broke to see the play on Broadway)...When I > played it for Jerry [Leiber], he said 'Your first verses suck,' or words to > that effect. 'Throw them away and start the song with your last verse, \\"We > got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout.\\"' When I protested to > Jerry that I couldn't start the song with the climax, he said, 'Oh, yes you > can.' So I rewrote the song and thanks to Jerry's editing and help, it > worked. I recorded the song on my first Kapp Records album, with Joan > Sommer, an old friend from Berea, Kentucky, singing the woman's part. Johnny > Cash learned the song from that album, A New Bag of Songs, produced by Jerry > and Mike. Story The song is about a married couple who find (according to the lyrics) that the \\"fire\\" has gone out of their relationship. It relates the desire of both partners to travel to \\"Jackson\\" where they each expect to be welcomed as someone far better suited to the city's lively night life than the other is. Which Jackson? There has been much speculation regarding which Jackson the song is about, but Wheeler said: \\"Actually, I didn‚Äôt have a specific Jackson in mind. I just liked the sharp consonant sound, as opposed to soft-sounding words like Nashville.\\" Though Wheeler had no particular Jackson in mind when writing the song, subsequent recordings have narrowed attributions to Jackson, Tennessee. The previous source also quotes Charlie Daniels as having recorded \\"Jackson\\" with these lines, \\"I ain't talking 'bout Jackson, Mississippi. I'm talking 'bout Jackson, Tennessee\\". And, Johnny Cash is quoted in the video from the same source: \\"Well, I was gonna take her down to see Carl Perkins in Jackson.\\" Carl Perkins lived in Jackson, Tennessee.Perkins, Carl; McGee, David (1996).

During business tourism (traveling), individuals are still working and being paid, but are doing so away from both their workplace and home. Some definitions of tourism exclude business travel. However, the United Nation World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) defines tourists as people \\"traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes\\". Primary business tourism activities include meetings, and attending conferences and exhibitions. Despite the term business in business tourism, when individuals from government or non-profit organizations engage in similar activities, this is still categorized as business tourism (travel). Significance Historically, business tourism takes the form of traveling to, spending money and staying abroad, being away for some time, and has a history as long as that of international trade. In late 20th century, business tourism was seen as a major industry. According to the 1998 data from the British Tourist Authority and London Tourist Board, business tourism accounted for about 14% of all trips to or within the UK, and 15% of the tourist market within the UK. A 2005 estimate suggested that those numbers for UK may be closer to 30%. Sharma (2004) cited a UNWTO estimated that business tourism accounts for 30% of international tourism, through its importance varies significantly between different countries. Characteristics Compared to regular tourism, business tourism involves a smaller section of the population, with different motivations, and additional freedom-of-choice- limiting constraints imposed through the business aspects. Destinations of business tourism are much more likely to be areas significantly developed for business purposes (cities, industrial regions, etc.). An average business tourist is more wealthy than an average leisure tourist, and is expected to spend more money. Business tourism can be divided into primary and secondary activities. Primary ones are business (work)-related, and included activities such as consultancy, inspections, and attending meetings. Secondary ones are related to tourism (leisure) and include activities such as dining out, recreation, shopping, sightseeing, meeting others for leisure activities, and so on. While the primary ones tend to be seen as more important, the secondary ones are nonetheless often described as \\"substantial\\". Business tourism can involve individual and small-group travel, and destinations can include small to larger meetings, including conventions and conferences, trade fairs, and exhibitions. In the US, about half of business tourism involves attending a large meeting of some kind. Most tourist facilities, such as airports, restaurants and hotels, are shared between leisure and business tourists, through a seasonal difference is often apparent (for example, business tourism may use those facilities during times less attractive for leisure tourists, such as when the weather conditions are less attractive). Business tourism can be divided into: * traditional business traveling, or meetings - intended for face-to-face meetings with business partners in different locations * incentive trips - a job perk, aimed at motivating employees (for example, approximately a third of UK companies use this strategy to motivate workers) * conference and exhibition traveling - intended for attending large-scale meetings.

Life and Academic Career Born to a prosperous German-speaking Jewish family in Brno in 1921, the young Graus was interned at Theresienstadt during World War II and lost most of his family in the Holocaust. Following the war, he returned to Prague, where he completed his degree in at the Charles University and began teaching medieval history at the Czech state Academy of Sciences. Following the Prague Spring of 1968, during which a nascent socialist reform movement was put down by an invasion of Soviet and other Warsaw Pact military forces, Graus emigrated and sought asylum in West Germany. Already a renowned scholar, he lectured for several years at universities in Giessen and Konstanz and in 1972 was awarded a chair in medieval history at the University of Basel in Switzerland, where he remained until his death. Scholarship Graus made important contributions to several areas of medieval history which in the 1960s and 70's did not yet receive a great deal of attention from most scholars in the West German historical academy. Graus's Czech doctoral thesis, published in 1965 as Volk, Herrscher und Heiliger im Reich der Merowinger (People, Ruler and Saint in the Merovingian Kingdom) was a groundbreaking study of how the early medieval hagiographic texts ‚Äì dismissed by most historians then as pious fictions with little or no historical value ‚Äì contained important insights on popular religious sentiments and social mentalities. His later work attempted to draw broad connections among diverse social phenomena, such as anti-Semitism, urban poverty, and religious fanaticism. Graus's methodologies and historical views were certainly informed by Marxism, though his conclusions and interpretations were not always Marxist in a doctrinaire way. As with historians of the French Annales School, Marxist questions, as well as his own Jewish heritage and experience in the war, lead Graus to examine underlying assumptions about power, ethnic identity, social status and the marginalization of certain groups in medieval society. He thus focused on topics such as the Black Death and peasant revolts that were traditionally treated within a broader scheme of political history, but from a perspective that attempted to get at how common medieval people thought about social justice, violence, ethnicity and religion. His 1980 book on the history of the western Slavic peoples of Europe replaced the notion of a \\"history of the Slavic nations\\" with the \\"history of Slavic national consciousness.\\" Rather than viewing ethnically-defined nations and nation states as historic inevitabilities, Graus tried to understand the evolution of national consciousness and sensibilities as historically contingent processes ‚Äì an idea which, although met with some skepticism at the time, foreshadowed the work of contemporary scholars like Benedict Anderson and Herwig Wolfram. Graus was one of the very few, if not the only, prominent, leftist, Jewish medievalists working in West Germany and the German-speaking academy in the post-war period (historians working in the GDR were expected, of course, to present a socialist gloss on their work as a matter of policy). Over the course of his career, much of Graus's work, and particularly his interpretation of social and political institutions, sought to offer a counterbalance to the predominant models of what the Germans call Verfassungsgeschichte, represented by historians like Karl Bosl, Walter Schlesinger and Otto Brunner and which had a strongly conservative-nationalist underpinning. Graus was unsettled by these theories and worked to place the study of medieval social history on a different footing, although not always successfully.

He is best known for almost becoming the Pharaoh of Egypt, and because his death caused a diplomatic incident between the Hittite and Egyptian Empires resulting in warfare. Biography The Egyptian Queen Dakhamunzu, who could have been Meritaten or Nefertiti, but is most often identified as Ankhesenamun, asked Suppiluliuma I to send over a son during the late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt because she had recently been widowed by the death of Nibhururia (possibly Akhenaten, but more likely Tutankhamun), and had borne no heir. Her letter reads, > My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many > sons. You might give me one of your sons to become my husband. I would not > wish to take one of my subjects as a husband... I am afraid. It was extraordinary that a consort from outside of Egypt would be sought, however, so Suppiluliuma was cautious. After sending an envoy to verify her claim, he obliged her. His son, Zannanza, was chosen and sent to Egypt to become the new pharaoh. This could have led to efforts to make Egypt part of the Hittite empire. Zannanza never made it past the Egyptian border, though exactly what became of him and how he died is unknown. His father accused the Egyptians of murdering him. The new king of Egypt, Ay, denied the murder, but acknowledged the death. Angry letters were passed between the two nations, but the matter ended inconclusively. Hittite forces subsequently attacked Egyptian settlements in Syria.Museum Tours - Amarna Sick prisoners of war brought back to the Hittite Empire after these attacks caused a deadly epidemic that spread rapidly throughout the empire; Suppiluliuma I died during the epidemic.Eric H.

However, supporters of the club continue to call it Recreation Park, Recreation Grounds or The Recs. In June 2016 it was announced that from the 2016‚Äì17 season, Alloa would ground share with Lowland Football League side BSC Glasgow, while the latter continued to work towards their goal of having their own facility. Structure and facilities Recreation Park has two seated stands, one on each side, totalling 919 seats. The main stand, which has just over 400 seats, runs approximately half the length of the pitch and is raised above ground level. The other stand, on the Hilton Road Side, is used by away team supporters. Views from both the main stand and the Hilton Road Side are impeded by the floodlight pylons, which run along each side of the pitch. The rest of the ground is open terracing, apart from a small cover at the Clackmannan Road End. The Ochil Hills are clearly visible behind the Railway End of the ground. Since 2007, an artificial pitch has been used at Recreation Park. The 3G surface was replaced in 2016 with upgraded MX TriMension technology. Transport Alloa railway station, which is within walking distance of Recreation Park, reopened in May 2008. It is served by trains on the Croy Line from Glasgow Queen Street and Stirling.

Fossils have only been recovered from the lower Elliot Formation in South Africa and Lesotho, and in one locality in Zimbabwe. History of discovery In 1863, Alfred Brown recovered fossil material consisting of limb bones and vertebrae, in the lower Elliot Formation in the southeastern Free State. In 1866, Thomas Henry Huxley first described Euskelosaurus from Brown's fossil material, and named the holotype specimen Euskelosaurus brownii after Brown. Harry Seeley later described Euskelosaurus in 1894, as did Friedrich von Huene in 1902. Since then, other researchers, including Robert Broom, have mentioned Euskelosaurus in their papers. Description Euskelosaurus is considered to have been a large, robust member of the sauropodomorph clade. Estimates from the existing fossil material measure this dinosaur at about 10m in length. Its bones are robust and it had a graviportal limb arrangement, a key character trait of basal sauropodomorphs. Classification While paleontologists currently consider Euskelosaurus a basal plateosaurid sauropodomorph, many paleontologists consider Euskelosaurus a ‚Äúwaste-basket‚Äù taxon.

He became an eminent professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and was credited with popularizing the acronym WASP (White Anglo-Saxon Protestant).In french : Fran√ßois Armanet, Mythologie : mes ann√©es disco, Le Nouvel observateur, num√©ro:2593, 17 juillet 2014, pages 66 √† 68, issn:0029-4713, accessdate:12 january 2019 His work shed new light on the ruling elite of America, changing public perceptions of American society and history. Life and career Baltzell was born in Philadelphia, to a wealthy Episcopalian family. \\"Digby\\" attended St. Paul's School, an Episcopal boarding school in New Hampshire. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of St. Anthony Hall, and graduated in 1940. He served as a naval aviator during World War II in the Pacific theater, then earned his doctorate from Columbia University. Raised in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia, he had houses on Delancey Place in Philadelphia and in Wellfleet, Massachusetts. An expert historian of Social Register clubs, he was asked to join many of them. He chose to be a member of only one, The Franklin Inn Club in Philadelphia, where he was a frequent luncheon guest during the last years of his life. He joined the faculty of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania in 1947. He was described as a dapper figure in tweed jackets and bow ties, popular in a slightly aloof way, but always courteous and accessible. He could often be seen pedaling an old one-speed bicycle between his Delancey Place home near Rittenhouse Square and Penn's West Philadelphia campus. Far more important to him than his personal preference for English clothes and for the ethos and manners of the gentleman was his conviction that aristocracy was necessary for the provision of leadership, both nationally and internationally. He felt that social stratification was inevitable, but that if the highest socio-economic levels were not accessible on the basis of merit (regardless of ethnic or racial background) society would degenerate into harmful caste-dictated divisions. His most productive years as an academic and social commentator corresponded to the actual relaxation of social barriers that took place in the late 1960s. It was apparent to students in his classes that he disdained the use of mathematical and statistical models as crutches to support sociological hypotheses. During the Vietnam War he once asked a class of predominantly male students the odds of being shot if one were sent into combat in Southeast Asia. After dismissing a few statistical responses from students, he gave the answer. \\"Fifty-Fifty,\\" he declared. \\"Either you will or you won't.\\" He dedicated one of his books to \\"all my undergraduate friends at the University of Pennsylvania, many of them grandsons of immigrants to the urban frontier, who, in spite of their possessing too many Jaguars and mink-coated mothers, have constantly been renewed by faith in the American Dream of unlimited opportunity\\". He was elected an honorary member of the Philomathean Society, the University of Pennsylvania's literary and debating society, founded in 1813. He served as a judge for the now-legendary Philo v. Whig-Clio (Princeton University) debate of 1984, donning a London barrister's white wig and helping to determine the victor (Philo) in the debate \\"Should there be a Hell?\\" which was featured on National Public Radio's \\"All Things Considered\\" and in the Congressional Record. Baltzell was appointed the Danforth Fellow at the Society for Religion in Higher Education of the Princeton Theological Seminary from 1967 to 1968, Charles Warren Research Fellow at Harvard University from 1972 to 1973, and Guggenheim Fellow from 1978 to 1979. He was a member of the American Sociology Association, the American Studies Association, and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Baltzell retired in 1986, and became Emeritus Professor of History and Sociology. Baltzell's first wife, the artist Jane Piper, died in 1991. In 1994, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was survived by two daughters, Eve and Jan Baltzell; his second wife, Jocelyn Carlson Baltzell; and two stepdaughters Justina Carlson and Julie Carlson Groves. He was also survived by a brother, Dr. William Hewson Baltzell, IV, a niece (Virginia Baltzell) and two nephews.

The temple was established by famous Hindu preacher and poet saint Sri Goswami Tulsidas in the early 16th century and is situated on the banks of the Assi river. The deity was named \\"Sankat Mochan\\" meaning the \\"reliever from troubles\\". In the temple, offerings to Lord Hanuman (called Prasad) are sold like the special sweet \\"besan ke ladoo\\", which the devotees relish; the idol is also decked with a pleasant marigold flower garland as well. This temple has the unique distinction of having Lord Hanuman facing his Lord, Rama, whom he worshipped with steadfast and selfless devotion. History It is believed that the temple has been built on the very spot where Tulsidas had a vision of Hanuman. Sankat Mochan Temple was founded by Tulsidas who was the author of the Ramacharitamanasa, which is the greatest version of lord Ram story written in Avadhi (\\"Most of the people having confusion that Ramacharitamanasa is a avadhi version of Valmiki Ramayana but Ramacharitamanasa is different from Sanskrit Ramayana written by rishi Valmiki as Baba Tulsidas Ji already told in Ramacharitamanasa that \\"Nana bhanti Ram avatara, Ramayan sat koti apara\\" means in each Kalp lord Ram takes Avatar & plays different-2 lilas(Act) so we have different stories of same lord Ram\\").Tradition promises that regular visitors to the temple will gain the special favor of Lord Hanuman. Every Tuesday and Saturday thousands of people queue up in front of the temple to offer prayers to Lord Hanuman. According to Vedic Astrology, Hanuman saves human beings from the anger of the planet Shani (Saturn), and especially people who have an ill-placed Saturn in their horoscopes visit this temple for astrological remedies. This is supposed to be the most effective way for appeasing Shani. While it is suggested that Hanuman did not hesitate to engulfs in his mouth the sun, the lord of all planets, which humbled all the gods and angels, making them worship him for the Sun's release. Some astrologers believe that worshiping Hanuman can neutralize the ill-effect of Mangal (Mars) and practically any planet that has an ill effect on human life. =Terrorist incident= On 7 March 2006, one of three explosions hit the temple while the aarti was in progress in which numerous worshippers and wedding attendees were participating. The crowd helped each other in the rescue operation after the explosion. The next day a large number of devotees resumed their worship as usual. Temple today The temple still continues to be attended by thousands of Rama and Hanuman devotees who chant Hanuman Chalisa and Sundarkand (also provided in the form of a booklet in the temple for free). After the terrorist incident of 2006, a permanent police post was set up inside the temple. Sankat Mochan temple is near the Banaras Hindu University. Sankat Mochan Foundation The Sankat Mochan Foundation (SMF) was established in 1982 by Veer Bhadra Mishra, the Mahant (High priest) of the temple, and has been working for cleaning and protecting the Ganges river. Its projects are funded in part by aid from the U. S. and Swedish governments. Mishra was formerly former Head of the Civil Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi [IIT(BHU)]Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi and was awarded United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established the \\"Global 500 Roll of Honour\\" in 1992, and later the TIME magazine's \\"Hero of the Planet\\" award in 1999. The foundation has been working with Australia- based environmental group, Oz Greene, under a programme called \\"Swatcha Ganga Abhiyan\\" for over 25 years. It celebrated its silver jubilee on 3‚Äì4 November 2007, with two-day event which concluded at the Tulsi Ghat, on the Ganges. Sankat Mochan Sangeet Samaroh Each year in the month of April, the temple organizes a classical music and dance concert festival titled \\"Sankat Mochan Sangeet Samaroh\\", in which musicians and performers from all over India take part. The first festival was organized 88 years ago, and it has invited musicians and dancers including Odissi guru Kelucharan Mahapatra, who was associated since its early days. In fact he was instrumental in starting women's participation in the festival with Sanjukta Panigrahi, Swapna Sundari and Kankana Banerjee. In 2009, the six-day concert saw over 35 artists including, vocalist Jasraj and Kathak exponent Birju Maharaj.

From 1928 until his death he was Gauleiter of Gau W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern, and from early 1933 held the offices of State President and Reichsstatthalter (\\"Reich Governor\\") of W√ºrttemberg. During World War II he also rose to the rank of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer in addition to his Party posts. At war's end he committed suicide with poison while in French custody.  Early life  Murr was born in Esslingen am Neckar. He grew up in Esslingen in poverty and lost both parents at the age of 14. He attended the Volksschule up to the 7th class. After commercial training, he completed military service from 1908 to 1910 and then worked as a salesman at the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen. During the First World War he served on all fronts, advanced to the rank of Vize- Feldwebel (Sergeant 1st Class) and spent the end of the war in 1918 injured in a military hospital in Cottbus. Murr became deeply involved in the Deutschnationaler Handlungsgehilfen-Verband (\\"German National Trade Assistants' Union\\"; DHV), a v√∂lkisch, rightwing, anti-Semitic employees' union that he had joined even before the war. There he came into contact with the anti-Semite Theodor Fritsch's writings and was greatly influenced by them. He joined the NSDAP in the summer of 1923, and after the Party was temporarily banned, he joined it again in August 1925. He eagerly recruited new members to the party at his workplace. A workers' newspaper criticized him in September 1927, saying that Murr's only job there was \\"to smuggle Hakenkreuzler ('crooked-cross devotees') into the works\\". It was also at this time that Murr got to know Richard Drauz, the later Nazi Kreisleiter of Heilbronn, whom Murr often patronized.  Rise to power  After fierce intra-party fighting, the local Esslingen leader Murr, who attracted attention for his ruthless and unscrupulous methods, was able to oust the incumbent NSDAP Gauleiter Eugen Munder from power. On 1 February 1928, Adolf Hitler appointed Murr to NSDAP Gauleiter in W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern. Another of his rivals he managed to bypass for promotion was Christian Mergenthaler. Murr was able to consolidate his position in W√ºrttemberg through strict subordination to Hitler and the Party. In October 1930, he gave up his job at the machine factory and began working full-time for the Party. The NSDAP's membership numbers and financial situation in W√ºrttemberg improved. Early in 1931 Murr introduced his own propaganda newspaper, the NS-Kurier, in which he published numerous editorials which, if not intellectually brilliant, faithfully gave the official party line right up until 1945. In the general elections of autumn 1930, Murr was elected a member of the Reichstag for the NSDAP in electoral district 31 (W√ºrttemberg). After the Nazis seized power and under Nazi pressure, the W√ºrttemberg Landtag chose Murr as W√ºrttemberg's new State President, thereby leading him to succeed his other political foe, Eugen Bolz. Murr also took over the Interior and Economic Affairs Ministries at the same time. On 6 May 1933, Murr was appointed to the newly created position of Reichsstatthalter (Reich Governor) in W√ºrttemberg; the office of W√ºrttemberg State President was abolished and the Landtag deprived of any function. His rival Mergenthaler, since early 1932 already Landtag president, became Murr's Prime Minister as well as Culture and Justice Minister. Murr's obvious intellectual shortcomings were touted as \\"populist\\" and he was described in Nazi propaganda as a \\"Man of the People\\". Joseph Goebbels, however, described Murr in a diary entry from 31 July 1933 as a \\"nouveau riche social climber\\". Murr's governance was notable for its petty ruthlessness. When Murr found out in 1938 that the Bishop of Rottenburg, Johannes Baptista Sproll, had not participated in the compulsory referendum on Austria's union with Germany, he initiated a campaign of newspaper articles and organized demonstrations which forced the bishop out of the province to Bavaria.  World War II  When war began in September 1939, Murr was appointed Reich Defense Commissioner of Defense District V, which brought him enormous power. Important sectors of military and civil administration were now directly or at least de facto subject to his direct control. Virtually nothing could happen in W√ºrttemberg without the consent of Murr or his agents. A member of the SS since 1934, he was promoted to SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 30 January 1942. The Holocaust carried out against Jews and the mentally ill went ahead smoothly in W√ºrttemberg thanks to Murr carrying out the F√ºhrer's and the Party's orders unconditionally. After the increasing severity of air raids on Stuttgart in 1943, Murr had the first inkling of a nasty end. He secretly prepared evacuation measures for Stuttgart, but remained a faithful spokesman for Hitler and Goebbels in public. Even when late in January 1944 Murr's only son Winfried, deployed with the Waffen-SS in Belgium, shot himself at the age of 21 to forestall court- martial proceedings for rape, Murr did not bring his loyalty to Hitler into question, going so far as to assure the F√ºhrer on 1 March that he would continue in his service.  The war's end and afterwards  When Murr‚Äôs nascent evacuation plans for Stuttgart became known in December 1944, which called for the city to be destroyed and the population led on 20-kilometer- per-day marches to the southeast, grumbling ensued and Murr gave up the plan by March 1945. On 10 April he called for the city to be defended to the utmost and forbade destruction of tank traps or the raising of white flags under threat of execution and Sippenhaft (detention of an offender's family). However, Murr himself fled Stuttgart on 19 April under a false name together with his wife and other companions. By way of Schelklingen, Ki√ülegg, Wangen im Allg√§u, Kressbronn am Bodensee and further stops the refugee convoy finally arrived in the Great Walser Valley in the Austrian province of Vorarlberg. Murr, his wife and two aides stayed at the Biberacher H√ºtte in the Alps until 12 May, then moved into an alpine cabin overlooking Schr√∂cken. There, on 13 May, they were arrested by French troops, to whom Murr identified himself as \\"Walter M√ºller\\". The arrestees were first taken to Schoppernau, then to Egg, in Vorarlberg, where Murr and his wife committed suicide using poison capsules they had carried with them. Both were buried in the graveyard at Egg. The American occupiers had put Murr on their List of Potential War Criminals under Proposed US Policy Directives and were searching for him. The Americans and the French soon came to suspect that Murr might be dead, and with the W√ºrttemberg police found evidence that led them to Egg. On 16 April 1946, the grave of \\"Walter M√ºller\\" and his wife was opened. His former dentist uniquely identified Murr on the basis of his teeth.

A partial maxilla or upper jaw bone from Prince Edward Island in Canada is the only known fossil of Bathygnathus. The maxilla was discovered around 1845 during the course of a well excavation in Spring Brook in the New London area and its significance was recognized by geologists John William Dawson and Joseph Leidy. It was originally described by Leidy in 1854 as the lower jaw of a dinosaur, making it the first purported dinosaur to have been found in Canada, and the second to have been found in all of North America (the first was Clepsysaurus from Pennsylvania, now known to be a phytosaur rather than a dinosaur). The bone was later identified as that of a pelycosaur. Although its current classification as a sphenacodontid synapsid was not recognized until after the discovery of its more famous relative Dimetrodonin the 1870s, Bathygnathus is notable for being the first discovered sphenacodont. A 2015 study by the researchers from U of T Mississauga, Carleton University and the Royal Ontario Museum reclassified the species into the genus Dimetrodon.http://phys.org/news/2015-11-canuckosaur-canadian-dinosaur- dimetrodon-borealis.html Description Speculative restoration of the head of D. borealis The teeth of Dimetrodon borealis are long, recurved, and distinctively teardrop-shaped, being widest at the middle rather than the base. The teardrop shape of the teeth is an indication that Dimetrodon borealis belongs to the family Sphenacodontidae. The shape of the maxilla indicates that Dimetrodon borealis had a deep skull like those of other advanced sphenacodontids like Dimetrodon. Like most other species of Dimetrodon, Dimetrodon borealis has an enlarged caniniform tooth near the front of the jaw. History of study The maxilla of Bathygnathus was found around 1845 in a community in the north of Prince Edward Island called French River. The bone was uncovered by a landowner named Donald McLeod in a layer of shale at the bottom of his well. This layer was part of a red sandstone formation that bears similarities to younger Triassic sandstones in the United Kingdom, leading geologists to think that the deposit dated back to the Triassic rather than the Permian. Canadian geologist John William Dawson purchased the fossil and was the first to recognize its significance. Dawson brought it to the attention of American paleontologist Joseph Leidy, who described it to the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences in 1854. Leidy identified the bone as a lower jaw, a mistake that was not corrected until English paleontologist Richard Owen reinterpreted it as an upper jaw in 1876. Leidy erected the new genus and species Bathygnathus borealis, which means \\"northern deep jaw\\" in Greek as a reference to the height of the jaw and its discovery in Canada. He identified it as belonging to a dinosaur, although he never called Bathygnathus a dinosaur in the paper (Dawson later described it as \\"a carnivorous reptile... one of that giant reptile aristocracy which constituted the highest animal type in the middle or secondary period of geologic time\\"). Leidy compared Bathygnathus with Thecodontosaurus from the Triassic red beds of the United Kingdom, one of the first dinosaurs to have been described scientifically. Dawson inferred that Bathygnathus was a fast- moving carnivore, reasoning that its deep skull was similar to the short skulls of fast-moving snakes and unlike the long skulls of slow-moving crocodilians. Local naturalist Francis Bain popularized the image of Bathygnathus as a dinosaur in the late 1800s, describing it as a \\"deep jawed monster\\" that could attack prey \\"with a bound of sixteen or eighteen feet... bearing it to the ground with its great weight, while the powerful claws prevented its escape, and the sabre-armed jaws completed the sanguinary work of destruction.\\" American paleontologist E. C. Case reclassified Bathygnathus as a pelycosaur (a type of \\"mammal-like reptile\\") in 1905, noting its similarities with the genus Dimetrodon, a sail-backed synapsid that was discovered in Texas in the 1870s. In their 1940 overview of pelycosaurs, Alfred Romer and Llewellyn Ivor Price suggested that Bathygnathus might be synonymous with Dimetrodon.

In 2013, Worcester‚Äôs Higgins Armory Museum closed its doors and its renowned collection of arms and armor was integrated into WAM‚Äôs. A permanent arms and armor gallery will open no later than 2023; in the meantime, major works from the Higgins collection are on view in galleries throughout the museum, alongside Greek, Roman, Asian, and European works of art. The museum is also rethinking its institutional narrative, leveraging the quality and depth of the collection to tell a story that is an alternative to those told by other museums in the area. The guiding principle for this endeavor is WAM‚Äôs new mission statement (adopted in 2017): The Worcester Art Museum connects people, communities, and cultures through the experience of art.  Architecture  Museum interior The Worcester Art Museum started as a small three-story building, designed by Stephen Earle and constructed by Messrs. Norcross Brothers, in 1898.[4] Very little of the exterior of this original building can be viewed due to the multiple expansions the museum has undertaken. In 1927, the museum purchased a 12th-century French chapter house that was originally part of the Benedictine Priory of St. John at Le Bas-Nueil near Poitiers. Installed in 1932, and linked to the museum in 1933 via the grand Renaissance Court, the chapter house was the first medieval building ever transported from Europe to America.[13] Decorating the Renaissance Court floor is unequivocally one of Worcester's greatest ancient treasures ‚Äì a group of Antioch mosaics dating from the first through the sixth century A.D, which was excavated at Antioch in Syria. The museum building has expanded several times, in 1940, 1970 (Higgins Education Wing addition), and 1983 (Frances L. Hiatt Wing). The Frances L. Hiatt Wing is designed for special exhibitions; study and storage area for prints, drawings, and photographs; and an expanded conservation area. The Higgins Education Wing contains studios and classrooms, a professional printmaking studio, a computer studio, photography lab, and an exhibition space for student works. In November 2015, the museum unveiled a new walkway ramp at the Salisbury Street entrance. Designed by Kulapat Yantrasast of wHY Architects, the bridge-like structure boldly combines contemporary design with the museum‚Äôs 1933 Beaux-Arts exterior while making the historic main entrance fully accessible.

European paintings include some Flemish Renaissance paintings, an El Greco, a Rembrandt, and a room of Impressionist and 20th-century works by Monet, Matisse, Renoir, Gauguin, and Kandinsky. The American painting collection includes works by Thomas Cole, Winslow Homer, John Singer Sargent, William Morris Hunt, Elizabeth Goodridge, among others. In the 20th-century gallery, the Museum displays works by Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, and Joan Mitchell. In 1901, John Chandler Bancroft, a wealthy Bostonian, bequeathed more than 3,000 Japanese prints. The Bancroft Collection spans the history of woodcut printmaking in Japan, with particular strength in rare, early images from the late 17th and 18th centuries. Salisbury's estate donation included many portraits commissioned by his family, as well as sculpture, furniture, and silver. These works, by artists such as Gilbert Stuart, Thomas Crawford, and Samuel F.B. Morse and the craftsmen Paul Revere, Edward Winslow, and Nathanial Hurd, constituted the nucleus of the American collections.Judith H.

The book continues the adventure of Jonas Taylor, a paleobiologist studying the megalodon, who now discovers another prehistoric monster, the Kronosaurus, also thought to have been extinct. A sequel titled Meg: Primal Waters was released in 2004. Plot summary Jonas Taylor, a paleontologist and former diver, knows what horrors lie deep within the Mariana Trench. He continues to have nightmares about his encounter with the megalodon, an ancient shark that was thought to be extinct and murdered his ex-wife, as well as several others close to him. Now four years later, Taylor works for his good friend, Masao Tanaka, at his institute, along with his current wife, Terry Tanaka-Taylor, the daughter of Masao Tanaka. Together, they have continued to study the offspring of the megalodon they have killed, a female megalodon named Angel, who has grown to be much larger than her mother. Things are not going well for the institute after it comes under new ownership by a man named Benedict Singer. Singer hopes to profit off of Angel and opens the aquarium to the public against Tanaka and Taylor's wishes. They know that Angel is unpredictable and tourist activity could set her off on a rampage. One night, three young boys sneak into the institute with the hopes of catching a glimpse of the prehistoric shark. While in the underwater observation deck, the teens torment and aggravate Angel, who bursts through the viewing glass. The teens struggle to swim for their lives, but Angel attacks and kills one while the other two drown after becoming cornered in the underwater area. The commotion from the attack alerts Taylor that something is wrong. He radios his good friend, Mac, who also works on the institute's grounds and together they go to investigate. When they find the carnage, Taylor and Mac jump into the tank in order to survey the damage. While submerged, they are attacked by a flurry of male great white sharks, who have become attracted to Angel because she is ready to mate. Mac notices too late that Angel's tank is badly damaged. The shark rams the gates to her tank and breaks free. Mac quickly grabs a nearby tagging gun and is able to shoot a tag into Angel before she disappears. Realizing that Taylor is too badly injured, Mac pulls him from the tank and rushes him to the hospital with Terry. In the days following Angel's escape, Tanaka grows increasingly weary. Afraid for another massacre in the future, Tanaka realizes that they must recapture Angel as soon as possible. Taylor knows that she will head back to the trench by instinct, but now that she has tasted human blood, she will also seek that out as a food source. Over the next week, Angel sightings crop up as she destroys a ship, kills surfers and kills a whale named Tootie that was released by Sea World back into the wild. As the body count continues to climb, Taylor teams up with a scientist named Michael Maren, whose ego is bigger than his career. Unknown to Taylor, Maren is working with Singer's assistant, Celeste, who is determined to find the Mariana Trench before them. Celeste tries to coerce Taylor into revealing the location of the Trench, but Taylor refuses, knowing that if Angel were to get into the hands of Singer, it would be a disaster. Taylor, Maren and Tanaka attempt to capture Angel, but fail; due to her size and speed. After tracking her path and predicted trajectory, Taylor concludes she is heading at full speed to the trench. Meanwhile, Singer pursues Terry and manipulates her onto his deep-sea research station to format and study sonar records to determine what happened to one of the station's research vessels. While there, Terry realizes the station has uncovered a new marine predator thought to be extinct; the Kronosaurus. While it was said this species was a solitary hunter, the Kronosaurs had evolved to hunt in packs due to being trapped in the trench. Terry realizes the operation is dangerous and is almost killed by the station's crew, but is able to escape in a lifeboat submarine while the crew is torn apart by the raging Kronosaurs. Meanwhile, still in his pursuit of Angel, Taylor receives word of Terry being caught up in the secret operation at the deep sea research station. Determined to save her and end his obsession with megalodons once-and-for all, Taylor heads to the research station to confront Singer and Celeste, who fled days prior after discovering the trench's location. After boarding the station, Taylor is shocked at the Kronosaur discovery, realizing that there could be many more extinct marine life living in the trench. Confronting Singer, it comes to light that he had discovered a gas within the rocks of the trench that could be used in fusion to make him more money than ever. Their digging uncovered the Kronosaurs that were living deep in the trenches. The station is attacked by the Kronosaurs as Angel arrives in the trench after having mated with another megalodon. Singer is killed by one of the Kronosaurs while Celeste escapes in a submersible. Angel destroys the sub and devours Celeste. Taylor reunites with Terry, who returned to the station after her escape and together they head to the surface. On their way, they are attacked by another Kronosaur, but Angel attacks the beast, allowing Taylor and Terry to escape. As they reach the surface, Jonas knows the future looks grim with more megalodons are introduced in the ecosystem thanks to the pregnant Angel's escape, as they could be a real environmental disaster. Terry assures him this is a new dawn for science, but Taylor expresses his hope to have a normal life away from the horrors of the deep. Several months later, Angel, now living deep in the trench, gives birth to two pups, confirming Jonas' fears.

In 2016 an additional team award, the Collaborative Award for Teaching Excellence (CATE) was launched. This award recognises teams for their collaborative work and excellent practice in teaching and learning. Currently around 55 NTF awards are made annually from a process that requires applicants to provide an evidenced and endorsed case of their approaches to teaching, and how their work has impacted on teaching and learning in higher education, within their institution and beyond. The application is assessed by two independent reviewers against set criteria. There are NTFs representing every academic discipline; each receives a monetary prize to enhance their individual impact on learning and teaching through for example continuing professional development and/or educational innovation and initiatives. Although the majority of NTF applicants are academic staff who teach, many work in professional services and management, for example library services or careers, and/or undertake pedagogical research. The NTFS scheme is managed and facilitated by the Higher Education Academy and is currently funded by Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW) and the Department for the Economy (DfE) in Northern Ireland.

HPDE events are held by various automobile enthusiasts' clubs at some of the most renowned road-course tracks around the world. Participants include both students and instructors. Students are grouped according to their ability and experience, with \\"Novice Group\\" students being the least experienced, \\"Intermediate Group\\" being more experienced and \\"Advanced Group\\" drivers being the most experienced. Some organizations permit advanced students to drive the racetrack without a ride-along instructor. Mandatory classroom instruction contributes to the overall learning experience and allows peer-group discussions of event logistics, on-track performance and track characteristics. HPDE events are not racing. Cars on-track operate under strict \\"rules of engagement\\" which minimize the likelihood of dangerous encounters with other cars. Occasional off-track excursions into the grass are normally controlled stops, with track personnel and on-board instructors supervising a safe re-entry onto the track. Passing among participants is facilitated only within defined \\"passing zones\\", and then only with clear hand signals and instructor confirmation. Many organizations increase the number of passing zones or eliminate the requirement for signals in groups with more experienced students to reduce traffic on track. HPDEs encourage participants to drive within their ability and improve their car-control skills with each event. Instructors and staff evaluate each student's progress throughout the weekend, and make recommendations on the student's advancement through successively higher skilled driver groups. It is extremely important for Novice drivers to learn the basic safety measures of the sport first such as entering the track, flags, corner worker functions and emergency procedures. It is also important to master basic car control skills and the racing line before worrying about how fast you are going. Some basic things for all novice drivers to learn include: * Track Safety * HPDE terminology * Proper seat and hand position * Looking ahead * Straight line braking * Brake point * Turn in point * Apex * Track out point * Understeer and oversteer Although the majority of participants utilize a performance vehicle, students are allowed to drive virtually any vehicle that has been deemed safe by a qualified mechanic and is known to have adequate handling characteristics for track use. Most schools require convertibles to have an approved rollbar. Some factory installed rollbars are not approved for track use. Factory-installed 3-point seatbelts and approved helmets are the minimum safety restraint system allowed. Safety Helmets with a Snell Memorial Foundation rating of \\"M\\" (motorcycle - not fire retardant) are required for some schools but most will require \\"SA\\" (speciality application - fire retardant) ratings, with the helmet specification being no older than 10 years (example: Rating SA-2000 helmets would normally be valid for HPDE events through the year 2010). The Snell Foundation normally releases upgraded helmet standards every five years. Some HPDE events also include a \\"Time Trial\\" segment where experienced students who have been \\"signed off\\" to drive without an instructor compete for fastest lap times. Time Trials are also conducted under strict rules which maximize safety and in many cases require additional safety equipment such as roll bars or fire extinguishers. Requirements for HPDE events vary greatly from organization to organization. Some being more strict than others regarding safety equipment, evaluation of driver skill and vehicles allowed to participate.

He gained considerable prominence in the U.S. as the featured speaker on the weekly NBC radio program, National Radio Pulpit, which aired from 1928 to 1962, and as a writer of several best- selling books on the Christian life. Time Magazine reported in 1946 that Sockman's National Radio Pulpit program received 4,000 letters weekly, making him \\"the number one Protestant radio pastor of the U.S. ...rated by volume of fan mail\\". Fifteen years later in 1961, Time said that Sockman was \\"generally acknowledged as the best Protestant preacher in the U.S.\\". In 1950, he was also appointed associate professor of practical theology at Union Theological Seminary in New York. Time Magazine said of him at the time: > \\"Sunday morning at 10 E.S.T., from October through May, 60-year-old Dr. > Sockman preaches on NBC's National Radio Pulpit to one of the biggest > religious radio audiences in the U.S. Then, at his Byzantine-style church on > Manhattan's Park Avenue, he holds a regular Sunday morning service (with > enough ceremony and liturgy to jolt many a low-church Methodist). So many > people come to hear him that at 5 in the afternoon he repeats his morning > service\\". He toured extensively for speaking engagements nationwide and often preached at the 6,000-seat Ocean Grove Auditorium on New Jersey's seashore, which was packed on \\"Sockman Sundays\\", as those occasions were popularly called. Some of his sermons from those appearances were subsequently published in 1939 as Ways of the Christian Life - Sermons by the Sea. Early years Raised on a farm in Mount Vernon, Ohio, Ralph W. Sockman graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University, where he earned a Phi Beta Kappa key. He studied for the ministry at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. In 1916, he married Zellah Endly, the daughter of a Methodist minister, and became pastor of what was then called the Madison Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church, the forerunner of Christ Church in New York City. Writings Sockman was a prolific writer, with some of his books still available and one, Now to Live!, reprinted in July, 2007.

Route description CR 534 eastbound past CR 706 in Deptford Township CR 534 begins along Cooper Street on the eastern edge of Woodbury, Gloucester County. It travels east along the two-lane Cooper Street through Deptford Township passing over the New Jersey Turnpike then widening to a four-lane undivided boulevard before coming to an intersection with Route 47. From Route 47, CR 534 heads through residential and commercial areas. The road narrows to two lanes after the CR 544 intersection before CR 534 splits from Cooper Street by heading southeast onto Good Intent Road, with CR 706 continuing along Cooper Street. The route passes more homes as it intersects CR 647 right before passing over the Route 55 freeway. The road turns more to the east-southeast as it crosses CR 621 and comes to the Route 41 intersection. CR 534 continues through residential areas prior to crossing into Washington Township, where it turns south and intersects CR 681 and CR 603 in a wooded areas. View east along CR 534 just after crossing the Mullica River in Shamong Township Upon crossing the South Branch of Big Timber Creek, CR 534 continues east into Gloucester Township, Camden County as East Church Road and passes homes in the community of Blackwood. In this area, the route crosses Route 168 (Black Horse Pike) prior to passing more residences. After CR 706 joins from the north, CR 534 interchanges with the Route 42 freeway before CR 706 splits south again. At this point, the route becomes Blackwood-Clementon Road and enters business areas, crossing CR 759. The road widens to four lanes before intersecting CR 673, where it narrows back to two lanes and forms the border between Lindenwold to the north and Pine Hill to the south. Here, the road passes through a mix of woods and residential and commercial areas, meeting CR 687 prior to entering Clementon and becoming Berlin Road. In Clementon, CR 534 intersects CR 683 before intersecting CR 703/CR 728 and Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line, and CR 686 in quick succession. The route heads into commercial areas as Clementon Road and intersects CR 727, CR 694, and CR 695 as it passes Clementon Amusement Park. The road turns southeast into wooded residential areas prior to heading east and meeting CR 733. The road forms the border between Clementon to the north and Pine Hill to the south until crossing CR 691, where CR 534 enters Berlin and passes more homes as a four lane road. The road crosses CR 692 and heads into more commercial surroundings as it intersects CR 702 and then US 30 and CR 690, at which point CR 534 forms a concurrency with US 30. CR 534's eastern terminus at Burlington CR 620 The two routes head southeast on the four-lane White Horse Pike, becoming concurrent with CR 561 a short distance later. The road turns to the south-southeast and passes through the downtown area of Berlin as a two-lane road. Past the downtown area, CR 534 and CR 561 split from US 30 at the same intersection, with CR 534 heading east on Jackson Road and CR 561 heading southeast on Tansboro Road. Jackson Road carries CR 534 through residential areas, crossing into Berlin Township upon passing over NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line. The road enters commercial areas as it crosses Route 73 before continuing into Waterford Township. In this area, the route passes a mix of woodland and homes, intersecting CR 713, CR 715, and CR 710. Farther east, CR 534 enters more dense forests of the Pine Barrens and comes to a junction with CR 714 near Atco Raceway. From this point, the road heads northeast into sparsely populated areas. Upon crossing the Mullica River, CR 534 continues into Shamong Township in Burlington County and becomes Jackson- Indian Mills Road. The road turns north-northeast, becoming Oak Shade Road at the Atsion Road intersection, and heads into a mix of farms and woods and reaches an intersection with CR 541. From here, CR 534 passes woodland and some homes as it reaches its eastern terminus at CR 620. History CR 534 formerly continued west from its current terminus through Woodbury. It began at the intersection with Route 44 in West Deptford, adjacent to Interstate 295/U.S. Route 130's interchange 21 and traveled east along Delaware Street (current CR 640) to downtown Woodbury, intersected Route 45/CR 551, became Cooper Street and intersected CR 553 before continuing onto its current route. Some signage along Delaware and Cooper streets imply that CR 534 still exists through Woodbury.

In end of 412 or beginning of 413, Charaton received the Byzantine ambassador Olympiodorus sent by Honorius. Olympiodorus travelled to Charaton's kingdom by sea, but does not record whether the sea in question was the Black Sea or the Adriatic Sea. As the History deals exclusively with the Western Roman Empire, it was probably the Adriatic, and visited them somewhere in Pannonian Basin. Olympiodorus recounts; > \\"Donatus and the Huns, and the skillfulness of their kings in shooting with > the bow. The author relates that he himself was sent on a mission to them > and Donatus, and gives a tragic account of his wanderings and perils by the > sea. How Donatus, being deceived by an oath, was unlawfully put to death. > How Charaton, the first of the kings, being incensed by the murder, was > appeased by presents from the emperor.\\" Although some scholars such as E. A. Thompson and Hyun Jin Kim have read Donatus as being a previous ruler, others, such as Franz Altheim and Otto Maenchen-Helfen, reject this assumption. Maenchen-Helfen argues that the name Donatus was common in the Roman Empire and that Donatus may have been a Roman who fled the empire to live with the Huns, as others are known to have done. Etymology The name is found in Greek as ŒßŒ±œÅŒ¨œÑœâŒΩ (Kharat≈çn). Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen notes that the -ton element might be an artifact of the Greek transcription, and the name may actually have ended in -tom, -ton, -to, -ta, or -t. Omeljan Pritsak, following an earlier suggestion by A. V√°mb√©ry, derived the root Chara- from Altaic xara - qara, with the meaning of \\"black\\" and \\"great; northern\\". He derived the second part -ton from a Saka loanword into Turkic, > *taun > t≈çn, \\"garment, clothing, mantel\\". Pritsak concluded that the name Qara-Ton (black clad; with black coat) was an intentionally cryptic term for horse, possibly related to Hunnic totemism. Maenchen-Helfen noted that the above proposal is \\"phonetically sound\\", but questioned whether the word ton had been loaned into Turkic in the fifth century. He suggests that if Charaton did in fact mean \\"black coat\\", then it could have been the name of Charaton's clan or tribe rather than his personal name; he compares the Kyrgyz tribal name Bozton (Gray Coats). F. Altheim suggested that the name is a title from *qara-tun, meaning \\"black people\\", with black referencing the direction north. Maenchen-Helfen also suggests an Iranian etymology as an potential alternative, with chara- deriving from a word akin to Parthian hara, xara (dark), as in the Parthian name Charaspes. He further notes that the -ton element is also found in the Scythian name Sardonius and the Ossetian name Syrdon.

(Cubic Technologies is now the successor organization of Helisys) In it, layers of adhesive-coated paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter. Objects printed with this technique may be additionally modified by machining or drilling after printing. Typical layer resolution for this process is defined by the material feedstock and usually ranges in thickness from one to a few sheets of copy paper. Process The process is performed as follows: # Sheet is adhered to a substrate with a heated roller. # Laser traces desired dimensions of prototype. # Laser cross hatches non-part area to facilitate waste removal. # Platform with completed layer moves down out of the way. # Fresh sheet of material is rolled into position. # Platform downs into new position to receive next layer. # The process is repeated until full model or prototype prepared. Note #Low cost due to readily available raw material. #Paper models have wood like characteristics, and may be worked and finished accordingly. #Dimensional accuracy is slightly less than that of stereolithography and selective laser sintering but no milling step is necessary. #Relatively large parts may be made, because no chemical reaction is necessary.\\"Laminated Object Manufacturing.\\" April 10, https://web.archive.org/web/20100102182152/http://home.att.net/~castleisland/lom.htm (accessed April 19, 2008). \\"Rapid Prototyping: LOM.\\" http://www.efunda.com/processes/rapid_prototyping/lom.cfm (accessed June 8, 2012).

Waukesha (WI), US: Kalmbach. . recreational railroad in Portland, Oregon's Washington Park with rolling stock built to 5/8 scale. Opened in three stages in 1958, 1959 and 1960, it provided transportation between the Oregon Zoo, Hoyt Arboretum, International Rose Test Garden, and the World Forestry Center. The extended line was about long. The service is currently operating on a loop within the zoo grounds. The railway carries about 350,000 passengers per year. The railroad is operational year- round except in January and part of February, when it is closed for required maintenance. Special events occur during the winter holidays. As of 2018, the price of a ticket was $4.00 for the short 6 minute internal loop., but zoo admission was also required. Zoo officials announced in September 2013 that the line would be closed for about one year for construction, with the last day of service scheduled to be September 22. The temporary closure was necessitated by the construction of the zoo's new Elephant Lands exhibit, which will also include remodeling of other parts of the zoo grounds. The short-loop route through the southwest part of the zoo grounds was scheduled to be removed permanently, and during the one-year suspension of service a new section of track was to be laid to create a replacement for the short loop. Train operations returned running on the new Zoo Loop line only as of November 22, 2014. In May of 2018 an online petition was created in opposition to the Washington Park Master Plan's endorsement to remove the \\"long route\\", which runs from the Oregon Zoo to the International Test Rose Garden. The master plan primarily called for the removal of all tracks so that it could be replaced by a paved twelve foot (12') wide path.goo.gl/vcdPm4 As of May 2020, over 37,000 people have signed the online petition in support of keeping and repairing the, \\"long route\\".goo.gl/RNJbrM History The Washington Park station (near the Rose Gardens), during its winter hibernation Originally named the Portland Zoo Railway, the \\"Zooliner Carries 106,000 Passengers, Earns $10,000 Net Profit in 90 Days\\".

The Sunday Oregonian, September 7, 1958, p. 31. The steam engine was named \\"Oregon\\", or alternatively \\"the Oregon\\". In the summer of 1959, the Portland Zoo Railway operated trains at two different sites.\\"Small Trains to Operate At Centennial, City Zoo\\". The Sunday Oregonian, May 3, 1959, p. 36. Nos. 1 and 2, the Oregon and the Zooliner, served a temporary railway line through the grounds of the Centennial Exposition, which lasted for about three months. The Zooliner entered service on the exposition's opening day, June 10, along with a second train hauled by a utilitarian diesel switcher locomotive temporarily filling in until the new steam locomotive, No. 1, was ready. The steam locomotive entered service on June 20,\\"27,867 Pass Fair Turnstile\\". The Oregonian, June 22, 1959, p. 1. and it and the streamlined Zooliner proceeded to carry passengers daily at the exposition all summer. Meanwhile, the railroad at the zoo's then-new site in the West Hills remained closed while construction continued on the zoo itself, but reopened on the latter's opening day, July 3, 1959 (by which time most animals had been moved from the old zoo).Richards, Leverett G. (July 4, 1959). \\"Joy Reigns Supreme at West Hills Zoo As Wonders of New Park Are Unveiled\\". The Oregonian, p. 1. For the next few months, the zoo line was served only by a train hauled by the locomotive that had been used during construction of that line. That locomotive (later becoming No. 5) was a diesel engine made to look like a steam locomotive, and the train was called the Circus Train. The engine and its cars have been modified several times since and are currently known as the Oregon Express.Terry, Jeff (March 2006). \\"Trains at the Zoo ‚Äî Part Two\\". Railfan & Railroad, pp. 9‚Äì11. Carstens Publications. .

The Oregonian, May 28, 1960, p. 7. Like the two trains, the small Washington Park station building was also first used at the Centennial Exposition and was moved to the new line after the fair closed. The railway was renamed the Washington Park and Zoo Railway in 1978, following the zoo's change of name (in 1976) to Washington Park Zoo. When the zoo was renamed again in 1998, as the Oregon Zoo, the railway was not renamed. The line also served the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry from 1958 to 1992 while that museum was located near the zoo. A suspension of service forecast to last at least through summer 2014 was due to begin on September 23, 2013, to allow construction of a new elephant exhibit area and changes to the railway's route within and near the zoo grounds. On November 22, 2014, operations resumed on the new Zoo Loop line. The railway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. Routes The steam train in scenery typical of the line, which runs through thick woods The 35-40 minute round-trip Washington Park route runs on weekends from mid-April until Memorial Day and then daily through Labor Day. (However, service along this route has been suspended for an undetermined time, as repairs are needed on retaining walls along the track.) This run goes through the woods of Washington Park and the grounds of the Oregon Zoo. (Few animals are seen from the train.) The Zoo station is near the zoo entrance (). The Washington Park station is a short walk from the International Rose Test Garden () and Portland Japanese Garden. The line includes a section of 4.5-percent grade.Falk, Susan (October 23, 1985). \\"Among zoo's rail crew, Number One is just that\\". The Oregonian, p. E7. In the off-season, weather and business permitting, the 10-12 minute Zoo Loop trip runs. This run goes through the Oregon Zoo grounds only. The Washington Park trips that operate during spring and summer months also cover this section. The Zoo Loop is mostly a one-way loop, whereas the two-way 2-mile line through Washington Park is single-track but equipped with a few sidings to allow trains running in opposite directions to pass. This allows up to three trains to be in operation at once.  Rolling stock  As of 2010, Washington Park and Zoo Railway has three trains in normal operation: The Zooliner, 4-4-0 No. 1 Oregon (original steam train), and Oregon Express. Two of them (the Zooliner, and 4-4-0 No. 1, Oregon) are scale replicas of real trains. In addition, there are two small switcher locomotives that are used for non-passenger purposes. Most regular service, including all non-holiday weekday service, uses only two diesel trains. The steam train operates on only a few weekends per year and for special events. In the 1980s, two of the three trains were equipped with wheelchair lifts to allow mobility-impaired persons to board the train, and in 2005 these lifts were upgraded so as to better accommodate heavier electric wheelchairs.Nkrumah, Wade (June 15, 2006). \\"Zoo volunteer works to improve train access\\". The Oregonian, p. B9. = The Zooliner = The Zooliner is a 5/8-scale replica of the diesel-powered Aerotrain, which is famous for its unusual shape that was influenced by automobile designs of the period when it was built, considered futuristic at the time. The Zooliner was built in 1958, its mechanical parts by Northwest Marine Iron Works and its streamlined bodywork by the H. Hirschberger Sheet Metal company of Portland. It first carried passengers in June 1958. The Zooliner is powered by a diesel engine with hydraulic transmission, which is WP&ZRy; locomotive No. 2. The brakes are pneumatic, the same as on its full-size namesake. The train includes four or five streamlined passenger coaches pulled by matching locomotive No. 2. The rearmost car was rebuilt in late 2005 to resemble a dome car, in connection with installation of a larger and more powerful wheelchair lift. = 4-4-0 No. 1, Oregon = 4-4-0 No. 1 Oregon is a 5/8-scaleRichards, Suzanne (June 22, 1989). \\"Zoo steam engine celebrates 30th\\". The Oregonian, p. MP1. replica of a classic American 4-4-0 steam locomotive of the 19th century. It was built in 1959 by the Oregon Locomotive Works. It is a scale copy of the 4-4-0 locomotive, Reno, of Nevada's Virginia & Truckee Railroad (built by Baldwin Locomotive in 1872). Unlike the original, No. 1 Oregon uses oil as a power source, but it is still a real steam locomotive (not a diesel that is made to look like a steam locomotive). It weighs about 8 tons. It first carried passengers on June 20, 1959, on the temporary Centennial Exposition line in North Portland, but was moved to the then-new Portland Zoo site around the end of the summer, when the exposition ended. The steam locomotive's original frame broke several times during its first two decades, but a new frame was built in 1982. The Oregon was taken out of service in August 2002, in need of extensive other repairs, and was almost retired and relegated to static display, due to lack of funds to pay for the repairs. However, donations resolved this problem, and the locomotive was overhauled and returned to service on April 2, 2004. Nowadays, No. 1 is normally only scheduled to operate on a few busy weekends per year, including Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend, but is also brought into use, as needed, to meet demand for train rides on weekends that have a particularly high number of visitors to the zoo. It is also normally used during the annual \\"Zoo Lights\\" event, held between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. = Oregon Express = The Oregon Express entering the zoo grounds from the woods of the park The train now known as the Oregon Express is the only one that is not a copy of a real train. Its diesel locomotive is WP&ZRy; No. 5. It was built in 1959 by Northwest Marine Iron Works/H. Hirschberger and originally was made to look like a steam train. It was later rebuilt to a relatively more modern style, with a slanted front end. The color scheme and decorative motif of the train have been changed a few times, as has the train's name, which has gone from the Circus Train to the Orient Express to the Oregon Express. = Other locomotives = Locomotives 3 and 6 are small industrial diesel locomotives, not normally used for passenger service. They are used for track maintenance and switching, but if needed can haul the passenger cars of the Oregon Express or Oregon trains as a substitute for those trains' regular locomotives (Nos. 5 and 1). Both were acquired secondhand from Weyerhaeuser. No. 3 resembles an early EMD switcher. Mail The line carries U.S. mail and was one of the first recreational railroads to have its own postmark, and is the last railroad in the United States to have continually offered hand-cancelling and processing of mail. The postal cancellation stamp was issued to the railroad by the U.S. Postal Service in 1961. The locomotive of the Zooliner has a postal mail slot on the side of the cab, and mail boxes are located at the Zoo and Washington Park stations.

M. Montgomery. It was published in late 1931 by McClelland and Stewart (Canada), Frederick A. Stokes Company (USA), and Hodder and Stoughton (UK) under the title Aunt Becky Began It. It centers on a community consisting mainly of two families, the Penhallows and the Darks. Over three generations, sixty members of the Penhallow family have married sixty members of the Dark family, creating a tangled web of relationships and emotions. The book was not as financially successful as Montgomery's earlier works as it was released after the Wall Street crash of 1929. Parts of the book were adapted from a short story that L.M. Montgomery had released earlier: \\"A House Divided Against Itself\\" which appeared in The Canadian Home Journal in March 1930. A story concerning members of the Penhallow family is also detailed in \\"The Winning of Lucinda\\" from Chronicles of Avonlea (1912), although this would appear to be a different branch of the family. The United States copyright of A Tangled Web was renewed in 1958. Plot Rebecca Dark (n√©e Penhallow) learns she is dying. A widow with no surviving children, she has been considered the unofficial head of the clan (the extended Dark & Penhallow families) for some time and is known to all of them as Aunt Becky. She has held periodic afternoon gatherings of her clan, which she calls levees, at her home over the years. The clan have a love-hate relationship with her levees, because they fear her sharp tongue, but derive a perverse enjoyment of seeing other members writhing under her digs and slams. She decides to hold a final levee where the reader meets the rest of the characters and learns a bit about them. She reads her self-written obituary to them, to their horror, followed by her will, which disposes of her possessions. Many of them are coveted by at least one member present, but very few of the announced recipients of each item are appreciative. The last item mentioned is the old Dark jug, an antique and prized family heirloom, although not of any great monetary value or artistic merit. She reveals the recipient will not be named now, but in a year's time and produces a heavily sealed envelope which has either a named person or a description of a person who best exemplifies what she feels are worthy qualities. In the year that follows, Aunt Becky has died and the family members try their best to live up to what Aunt Becky would have wanted in an attempt to win the heirloom, and in the process, many achieve self-discovery. There are several intertwining stories, but the most important ones involve the following characters: Young Gay Penhallow's fianc√©, the shallow Noel Gibson, dumps her for Nan Penhallow, a devious and deceptive girl. Although she still pines for Noel, Gay's friendship with Dr. Roger Penhallow, 14 years her senior, deepens as Gay is matured by her grief. When Noel attempts to return to Gay, she realizes that her infatuation with him pales next to her love for Roger. Donna Dark and Peter Penhallow, who have despised each other since childhood, suddenly fall in love. They immediately make plans to get married, but their rival families soon discover their relationship. Although Donna and Peter resist attempts to break them up, they argue while they are eloping and part in anger. Peter leaves for South America. The couple remain estranged until Peter, who has returned at the end of a year, saves Donna from a fire. They then get married and leave for Africa. Joscelyn and Hugh Dark separated on their wedding night, when Joscelyn confessed that she was in love with Hugh's best man, Frank Dark. They remain separated for ten years until Frank returns and Joscelyn realizes that he was not worth the passion she felt for him. She regrets her decision to leave Hugh and is sure that he must despise her. After a confrontation with Hugh's mother, Joscelyn realizes that Hugh still loves her and she returns to him. Margaret Penhallow, the family dressmaker and an old maid, agrees to marry Penny Dark in order to improve both of their chances of getting the jug. Although she is not very fond of Penny, Margaret longs for a home of her own. Penny, similarly, has doubts about the match as he enjoys being a bachelor. He eventually decides to break the engagement, and is surprised and chagrined by Margaret's joy over her \\"jilting\\". Margaret then sells a first edition of The Pilgrim's Progress that she inherited from Aunt Becky and uses the money to buy a house for herself and to adopt Brian, an illegitimate and lonely orphan who is largely neglected by the family. In the end, Dandy Dark, the person in charge of the jug, confesses that his pigs have eaten Aunt Becky's final instructions. As the family prepares to argue over the jug, the Moon Man, the eccentric Oswald Dark, destroys it.

This species is found in both North and South America. The larval host plants are Celtis species on which the eggs are laid singly. Massive migrations of this species often attract attention in the Texas and Mexican newspapers. Dorsal view Side view Snout butterflies have prominent elongated mouthparts (labial palpi) which, in concert with the antennae, give the appearance of the petiole (stem) of a dead leaf. Snouts often take advantage of this superb camouflage by hanging upside down under a twig, making them nearly invisible. Wings are patterned black-brown with white and orange markings. The forewings have a distinctive squared off, hook-like (falcate) tip. The caterpillars appear humpbacked, having a small head, swollen first and second abdominal segments, and a last abdominal segment which is tapered and rounded. They are dark green with yellow stripes along the top and sides of the body, and have two black tubercles on the top of the thorax. Their food is the common hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) tree.American Snout, Butterflies of Canada This species is known to be migratory, and some years the migrations are so huge as to darken the sky in places. Migrations from South Texas northward occur at irregular intervals when southern populations explode, often affecting San Antonio,> the Texas Hill Country,> and Austin.> Other migrations have been observed in Arizona, Kansas, and the Lake Erie Islands. Migrations occur from June through October, and are thought to be triggered by droughts followed by heavy summer rains: the droughts reduce a parasitoid that would otherwise limit butterfly populations, whereas the rains induce the spiny hackberry to grow new leaves which provide food for caterpillars. Furthermore, whereas the droughts send the butterflies into a sort of hibernation, the rains bring them out of it all at once to lay eggs, causing a population explosion. In Texas, years in which migrations were observed include 1921, 1978, 1996, 2018, and 2020.

The Anthony Roll is a paper record of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It originally consisted of three rolls of vellum, depicting 58 naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to King Henry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the royal library. In 1680 King Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which is now in the Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by King William IV to his daughter Lady Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library. The Anthony Roll is the only known fully illustrated inventory of ships of the English navy in the Tudor period. As the work of a successful state official in 16th century England, the artistic value of the Anthony Roll has been described as being characterised by \\"naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern\\" though its artistic aspects display \\"a decent amateur grasp of form and colour\\". While the inventories listed in its text have proven to be highly accurate, most of the ship illustrations are rudimentary and made according to a set formula. The level of detail of the ship design, armament and especially rigging has therefore proven to be only approximate. Nevertheless, through their depiction of the ceremonial ornamentation the illustrations in the Roll have provided relevant secondary information to the study of Tudor period heraldry, flags and ship ornamentation. The only known contemporary depictions of prominent Tudor era vessels like the Henry Grace √† Dieu and the Mary Rose are contained in the Anthony Roll. As the Mary Rose sank by accident in 1545 and was successfully salvaged in 1982, comparison between the information in the Roll and the physical evidence of the Mary Rose has provided new insights into the study of the naval history of the period. Author and artist Anthony Anthony has been identified as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature, which has been compared with holograph letters among the State Papers. Anthony's father was William Anthony (died 1535) a Fleming from Middelburg in Zeeland who migrated to England in 1503. William was a supplier of beer to the army, and Anthony followed in his father's footsteps. He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy. In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the Tower of London, a position he retained nominally until his death. He rose to the rank of overseer of the Ordnance Office, the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery, and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll. In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower, Calais, Boulogne, and elsewhere for life. He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces, and was active in the last month of his life supplying guns for an expedition against Le Havre. In 1939 Dutch historian Nicholas Beets proposed that the Flemish artist and cartographer Cornelis Antoniszoon (or Antonisz., c. 1507‚Äì1553) could have been Anthony Anthony's brother. Although Beets' suggestion of kinship was conjectural and without any direct evidence, it was picked up by Geoffrey Callender in the Mariner's Mirror in 1963 and has been relayed by several other authors. The will of William Anthony did not mention any other sons and Anthonisz. is believed to have been the son of Antonis Egbertson, the daughter of Jacob Corneliszoon van Oostzanen. That Cornelis and Anthony were related is, in the words of Ann Payne, \\"not, presumably, impossible, but there is little evidence that they were connected at all\\". History of the manuscript The Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover, a contemporary painting that, just like the Anthony Roll, was intended to serve as a showpiece of Tudor royal authority and military might. The \\"ship portrait\\" had a long history in maritime art, from medieval seals and coins to early engravings in the 15th century, and the plain side-on view of a ship under sail, often with no crew shown, was well established as the most effective way of recording the build of vessels. The Anthony Roll belongs to a genre of works that was intended to serve a dual role for the king and the military leadership: as reasonably informative overviews listing details of ships or strategic areas of coastlines they could be studied to determine strengths and weaknesses, and as boastful and lively depictions of Tudor military might they could be used to flatter the king, impress courtiers and impose martial authority on foreign ambassadors. Contemporary maps, or \\"plats\\", were routinely decorated with detailed pictures of ships, to mark bodies of water as much as to liven up the scenes. Such maps were common at the time, and were even embellished by artists if deemed too simple or drab. The navy was expanded during Henry VIII's reign, and he was known to take an interest in warships, as can be seen by the epic painting Embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover which portrayed, if rather unrealistically, the ships that took the 29-year-old king to the summit meeting with Francis I of France at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. This painting, recently dated to around 1545, has also been suggested as a likely source of inspiration to Anthony for his illustrations. There are three such plats depicting naval actions and expeditions that are attributed to Anthony: the route of Anne of Cleves from the Low Countries to England (1539), a French attack on a coastal fort (date unknown) and a French raid on Brighton (July 1545). The design of the ships in these paintings, especially that of the Brighton raid, closely match those in the rolls. It is not known exactly when work on the rolls began nor when it was finished. It is only certain that it was presented to the king the year it was dated, 1546. The inclusion of the Mary Rose that sank at the Battle of the Solent 19 July 1545 does not mean it was necessarily started before this date, since it was still considered possible that she could be raised even as late as 1549. The galleasses, the Antelope, Hart, Bull and Tiger, all present in the second roll, were still being built around March 1546, and the Hart was not at sea until October that year. At the same time the Galley Blanchard, captured from the French 18 May 1546 is not included. Samuel Pepys in 1689. Pepys, the owner of two of the rolls, had them cut up and bound in a single volume. After the rolls were presented to the king they were archived in the royal collections. In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, a navy administrator and avid book collector. Pepys did not disclose the details of how the rolls were given to him, but it is believed that the gift came out of a meeting with King Charles where Pepys took down the king's account of how he escaped from the Battle of Worcester (1651). The plan was that Pepys would edit and publish the already famous story, but he never did so. It is also known that Pepys was planning to write a history of the navy and that he was gathering material for this task, but this project also was never finished. It is considered likely that King Charles was aware of Pepys' plans and presented him with two of the rolls either as a gift or as payment for the intended publication of the escape story. The second roll could not be located at that time, and it was not until 1690 that it was discovered by Henry Thynne, keeper of the royal library 1677‚Äì89 and a close friend of Pepys. Thynne arranged for Pepys to make copies of some of the illustrations, but by 1690 Charles was dead and James II was in exile. Pepys had resigned from his position as Secretary of the Admiralty that same year and refused to recognize the reign of William III and Mary II, which meant that acquisition of the final roll for his collection was out of the question. The creation of the codex from the first and third rolls is therefore assumed to have been completed shortly after that time. After Pepys' death in 1703 his library passed on to his nephew John Jackson. After the death of Jackson in 1724 the library, along with the codex, was then passed on to Pepys' old college at Magdalene, Cambridge, where it remains to this day. The second roll was presumed lost by the 1780s, but actually remained in the hands of the royal family. William IV gave it to his illegitimate daughter Mary FitzClarance sometime in the early 19th century. In 1824, FitzClarance married Charles Robert Fox, a major- general and from 1832‚Äì35 an officer of the surveyor of the ordnance, the same position Anthony Anthony had three centuries before him. Fox was a bibliophile, and historian Charles Knighton has suggested he knew the value of the roll, but its location nevertheless remained unknown to scholars. In 1857 Frederic Madden, keeper of manuscripts at the British Museum, was shown the second roll and learned that Mary Fox wished to sell it. After negotiations it was sold for ¬£15 to the British Museum and was numbered Add MS 22047.Anthony roll at the British Library It was kept in its original format as a roll and has been stored in the British Library's manuscript collection at St Pancras since 1999. The Anthony Roll has been used frequently as a primary source for histories of the English navy of the 16th century but the full text and all illustrations were not collected in one volume until 2000. Description A view of the second roll of the Anthony Roll, showing the layout used throughout the document. The information for each vessel is displayed in columns directly below its illustration, here with the text for the Grand Mistress (seen only partially above the text) and a full view of the illustration of the galleass Anne Gallant. The Anthony Roll was originally a set of three separate vellum rolls. It exists today in the form of a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of and a height varying from . After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace √† Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Add MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing. The three rolls list 58 ships divided into classes based roughly on size and construction. Each ship is presented along with its name, tonnage, crew size and, in Anthony's own words, \\"the ordenaunce, artillery, munitions and habillimentes for warre\\". The first roll lists the carracks and one pinnace, beginning with the largest ship Henry Grace √† Dieu. The second roll lists galleasses, a hybrid of oar-powered and sailing vessels, and one galley. Finally, the third roll is reserved for pinnaces and \\"rowbarges\\", both basically smaller versions of galleasses. Artistic analysis The Galley Subtle, a Mediterranean-type galley which formed the centrepiece of the three combined rolls and the illustration that displays the highest artistic quality. Anthony Anthony was not a trained, professional artist. The illustrations are described as \\"striking and boldly executed, but [...] have few claims to be fine works of art\\". The vessels are for the most part painted according to a standard formula, with distinct repetitions even in the more elaborate depictions. Anthony's style is signified by a \\"naive draughtsmanship and conformity to a pattern [...] consistent with the abilities of a government official with a decent amateur grasp of form and colour\\". The rolls were all of roughly the same length, about , and would most likely have been presented side by side for display on a table or hung on a wall. The focal point of the whole composition is in the second, middle roll where the exceptionally well-executed painting of the Galley Subtle is placed. That this ship was intended to be the centrepiece illustration is made clear by the presence of the pinnace Mary James in the first roll, which is otherwise reserved for (sailing) ships. This appears to have originally been placed at the beginning of the third roll, among the other pinnaces and rowbarges, but was moved to achieve more equal lengths. In his pursuit of living up to the image of a Renaissance prince Henry is known to have been particularly fond of galleys, something which would have been known to Anthony. The lettering, framing lines and floral pattern decorations are painted in red or black with the exception of the first three ships of the first roll, which also feature gold. Most of the illustrations were first sketched with plummet outlines and were then painted over in washes. Ship timbers are a light brown that are shaded in the bow and stern to achieve depth, decorations and anchors are highlighted with red, and green is used for guns. Contours are in black and the sea is in shades varying from \\"greyish green\\" to \\"a richer blue\\". Salamander, a galleass captured from the Scots and one of only three ships in the Anthony Roll which has an identifiable figurehead. The first two rolls were done with roughly the same amount of detail while the lesser rowbarges (essentially small galleys) were done more hastily. The first two ships of the first roll, the Henry Grace √† Dieu and the Mary Rose, have traces of a grid pattern, indicating that they were transferred from a different drawing while the rest are done in freehand. Overall, the ships follow a formula depending on the type of ship. The exceptions are stern galleries of some of the galleasses and the figureheads of the Mary Rose, Salamander and the Unicorn, the latter both captured from the Scots in 1544. The prominent exception is the Galley Subtle placed in the middle of the second roll. It is more consistent in type with Mediterranean-type galleys than the galleasses and small rowbarges, and features a considerable amount of detail not present in the other ships. It is the only ship where any crew is visible, in this case rowers behind pavisades as protection from enemy arrows and an overseer wearing \\"a bonnet, full skirted armorial doublet and baggy breeches\\" holding a stick or baton, as if beating the time of the strokes of the rowers. Use as an historical source As an historical record, the Anthony Roll is in many ways unique. It is the only known fully illustrated list of a Tudor period royal navy,> though the pictures should not be seen as exact depictions drawn from real life. For example, the lists of guns of the individual ships, which are considered to be an accurate record produced by a senior state official, are only approximately matched to the paintings. The rigging is only roughly accurate, and has been described by Margaret Rule, archaeological project leader of the Mary Rose excavations, as \\"a confusing assemblage of shrouds, ratlines and stays\\". Many details are present, but others are missing, such as the chain-wales (the horizontal platforms extending from the sides) to which the shrouds (the parallel ropes that stabilized the masts) were attached to keep them clear of the hull. \\"Peter Promengrate\\" sister ship of the \\"Mary Rose\\" =Comparisons with the Mary Rose= The illustration of the Mary Rose, which has been compared to the salvaged wreck of the actual ship to determine the historical accuracy of Anthony Anthony's ship portrayals Comparisons with the finds from the salvaged Mary Rose itself have provided an opportunity to compare the accuracy of the records provided in the Roll. The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible because of the lack of an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since it implies two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested. The guns in the back of the forecastle have defied explanation, but one theory is that they were included to compensate for the guns that were positioned in the aftcastle, aiming forwards, but which would have been obscured due to the angle from which the ship was depicted. The list of ammunition, small firearms, longbows, arrows, pikes, and bills closely matches the archaeological evidence. As the source that is closest in time to the sinking of the Mary Rose, it has been of central importance for the archaeological project, especially in estimating the size of the crew. =Flags and ornamentation= The carrack Pansy with various types of heraldic banners along its railings. The Anthony Roll provides detailed information about the flags used on the ships. According to the vexillologist Timothy Wilson, the flags depicted flying from the ships are \\"the most elaborate source we have for the flags flown on the ships of King Henry VIII, being richer in visual detail than all other sources put together.\\" Among the most striking flags in the illustrations are the elongated ceremonial streamers, shown flying from all ships in varying numbers. These feature a Saint George red cross on white ground on the hoist, nearest the flagpole, and a very long tail striped in green and white. They all feature gold paint on the red and green, and silver paint (now oxidized to black) on the white. This artistic device was used either to simulate the fluttering of the flags or to actually display the metallic thread and paint that was sometimes used to decorate them. Along the railing of all ships, most prominently on the large carracks and the Galley Subtle, there are rows of banners displaying various heraldic designs, including the English royal arms, one or three fleur-de-lis of the French arms, Saint George's crosses and Henry VIII's monogram (\\"HR\\") in gold on blue, what appears to be the Tudor rose, and the green and white of the House of Tudor. The depictions of the flags and banners on the ships are in a heraldic and military sense considered to be roughly accurate but not entirely consistent. A kind of system of command among the various vessels is apparent in how flags are displayed on the masts, but it does not appear to have been carried through systematically. Some of the heraldic designs have been described as \\"unlikely\\" by the 20th century herald George Bellew, but have deemed to at least be \\"plausible\\" by Wilson.

His family, through his son Richard, became prominent and hereditary members of the Netherlands' nobility. Life The son of Richard Trench and Frances Power, William was a Member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons, and supported the Whigs. He represented Galway County from 1768 until 1797 and served as High Sheriff of County Kilkenny in 1777. He was advanced to the Irish House of Lords as Baron Kilconnel (created 25November 1797), and to the position of Viscount Dunlo (created 3January 1801) as a reward for his continuing support of the Whig Party. On 12February 1803 he became Earl of Clancarty. His choice of the title is derived from his descent from Elena MacCarty, wife of John Power, daughter of Cormac Oge MacCarty, Viscount Muskerry, and sister of Donough MacCarty, 1st Earl of Clancarty. He therefore became the first Earl of Clancarty in its second creation. He was succeeded by his son Richard. The Trench family seat was at Garbally in Ballinasloe. Family On 30October 1762 he married Anne Gardiner, daughter of Charles Gardiner of Dublin and Florinda Norman, and sister of Luke Gardiner, 1st Viscount Mountjoy.

It exhibits modern and contemporary art, as well as Greek, Roman, and Etruscan antiquities. The museum was founded in 1979 and debuted an award-winning new building in 2010 just north of its original site along Tampa's Riverwalk on the banks of Hillsborough River.  History  Since its inception, museum planners knew that the Tampa Museum of Art's original building was too small for its collection. Proposals for expansion or relocation were the subject of discussion and controversy for years. Several different plans were proposed either by the city of Tampa or the museum board, including: * in 2001, architect Rafael Vinoly designed a dramatic $76 million building which would have included a huge metal canopy overhanging nearby city streets. The project proved too costly and perhaps unsafe in a hurricane. * from 2003 to 2005, Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio proposed that the museum be relocated to one of several abandoned or underutilized buildings downtown, including an old federal courthouse and a small office tower. However, the museum board was unenthusiastic about the choices. As it turned out, converting the courthouse into usable museum space proved too expensive and disagreement over the appraised price of the office tower scrapped those plans as well. In 2006, the museum board and the city of Tampa agreed to use public and private funds to construct a $33 million new museum building just a half-block north of its original location. The museum is integrated into the city's Riverwalk project in Curtis Hixon Park at the site of old Curtis Hixon Hall. A new home for the Tampa Children's Museum (now known as the Glazer Children's Museum) was built simultaneously next door. The old museum building had to be torn down to make way for the current one. In the interim, the Tampa Museum of Art was temporarily moved to the historic Centro Espanol building in West Tampa, which had been vacant for several years. Groundbreaking for the project took place on April 18, 2008, and the grand opening of the new Tampa Museum of Art took place on February 6, 2010 Building Entry to the art museum The building, by architect Stanley Saitowitz, is designed to look like \\"an electronic jewelbox box sitting on a glass pedestal\\" and makes use of aluminum, glass, and fiber optic color-changing lights in the exterior walls to \\"make the building itself a work of art\\". The interior is more neutral, with mostly white surfaces and subdued lighting. The architect describes it as \\"a frame for the display of art, an empty canvass to be filled with paintings, a beautiful but blank container to be completed by its contents.\\" It includes a gift shop and an indoor/outdoor cafe. In 2010, the Tampa Museum of Art was chosen as a winner of an American Architecture Award by The Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design.

Owned by Cox Media Group, the station is aired on Comcast (as well as the now defunct Adelphia cable TV systems, which were taken over by Comcast) channel 35 and on Verizon FiOS channel 9 in Western Pennsylvania. History PCNC signed on as the first and only 24-hour cable news channel for Pittsburgh on January 1, 1994. PCNC was created in a partnership between WPXI (Channel 11) and the region's largest cable TV company at the time, TCI. Now, that partnership exists between WPXI and Comcast. PCNC made Pittsburgh history with the first 10 PM newscast, anchored by WPXI's David Johnson. The 10 O'Clock News aired from 1994-January 29, 2006, when WPXI and WPGH-TV \\"FOX 53\\" entered into a newshare agreement, which allows WPXI to produce a 10 PM newscast for WPGH-TV. WPGH-TV had aired its own newscast from January 28, 1997 ‚Äì January 30, 2006. PCNC now airs a 7 PM newscast in place of its 10 PM show. During its early years, the station also aired a viewer call-in show titled 'TalkBack' which allowed Channel 11 News viewers to call in and talk about the day's news and events. The show was hosted by Johnson. Another original program on PCNC is 'NightTalk', originally hosted by John McIntire in the late 1990s. Currently, the program features interviews of local and national newsmakers, analysts, commentators, and celebrities with a focus on the latest current events of the day, often with a Pittsburgh or Pennsylvania appeal. The show also occasionally has lighter segments and broadcasts, including programs such as the monthly 'Rush To Judgment' version of the show that features prominent Pittsburgh attorneys. Currently, 'NightTalk' airs at 8 PM Mondays through Fridays and is hosted by Beaver County, Pennsylvania sports hall-of-fame broadcaster Ellis Cannon. On Friday nights at 8 PM, 'NightTalk: HAPPY HOUR' airs and features NightTalk regulars discussing the week's trending topics in a lighter way. PCNC also entered the local daytime talk show programming, giving local radio talkshow host Lynn Cullen her own show weekdays at 10 AM. The show was titled 'Cullen on Cable' and it aired in the late 1990s. Cullen returned to PCNC on August 15, 2005, with a similar but different program. Her most recent program on PCNC was titled the 'Lynn Cullen Show' which was a condensed version of her weekday radio show which aired on WPTT 1360 AM. The show repeated weekdays at 6 PM. When Cullen left her original show at PCNC, it was replaced by Fred Honsberger, another local radio talk show host. His show was titled 'Honsberger Live' and it aired at 10 AM. The program ended following Honsberger's death in 2009, and was replaced by PITTSBURGH NOW, which is hosted by veteran broadcaster Chris Moore. From 2014-2016, 'NightTalk' was produced by media personality and political pundit Lenny McAllister. The show aired at 8 PM Mondays through Thursday and remained hosted by Ellis Cannon. On Friday nights at 8 PM, 'NightTalk: Get To The Point' aired with McAllister serving as both host and producer. The Friday show shifted from Cannon's one-on-one interview style and opinion-driven format to a current-affairs roundtable format featuring experts addressing regional, national, and international issues similar to Sunday morning political shows. In 2016, McAllister left PCNC to win the Republican nomination for U.S. Congress in Pittsburgh. In March 2006, PCNC and Comcast teamed up to replay the Western Pennsylvania high school basketball championships. PCNC has also aired other various cooking, health and law related programs throughout the years. Other programs have included 'Our Region's Business', 'Fedko Fone Zone', 'Championship Chase', and 'A Day in the Life', among others.

The skull lacks extensive cranial ornamentation, a trait which has been interpreted as plesiomorphic for ankylosaurs. Discovery In 1990, Sue Ann Bilbey and Evan Hall discovered a quarry with the remains of ankylosaurs near the Price River in Carbon County, Utah. In 1998, the discovery was reported in the scientific literature.Carpenter K., Kirkland J.I., 1998, \\"Review of Lower and middle Cretaceous ankylosaurs from North America\\", New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 14: 249-270 In 2001, the type species Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum was named and described by Kenneth Carpenter, James Kirkland, Donald Burge and John Bird. The scientific name means \\"Bilbey and Hall's Cedar (Mountain) shield,\\" with the genus named for the Cedar Mountain Formation and the animal's armored plates ‚Äî from the Greek pelte, \\"small shield\\" ‚Äî and the specific name honouring Sue Ann Bilbey and Evan Hall as the discoverers of the type locality.Carpenter, K., Kirkland, J. I., Birge, D., and Bird, J. 2001. Disarticulated skull of a new primitive ankylosaurid from the Lower Cretaceous of Utah. in Carpenter, K. (editor) 2001. The Armored Dinosaurs. Indiana University Press Cedarpelta is known from remains recovered at the CEM and Price River II quarries (PR-2) in eastern Utah; these sites were originally thought to be within the Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, but are now assigned to the base of the overlying Mussentuchit Member, dating to between 116 and 109 million years old (approximately the Aptian-Albian boundary). = Holotype = Carpenter et alii (2001) designated CEUM 12360 as the holotype specimen of Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum (CEUM is the acronym of the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum in Price, Utah). CEUM 12360 consists of an articulated, incomplete skull lacking the snout and mandibles. Carpenter et al. (2001) also designated a long list of paratype material, mostly isolated bones that could be referred to Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum. In 2008, Carpenter e.a. referred additional material found in Emery County. This includes previously unknown hindlimb elements.  Description  Cedarpelta was a large ankylosaurian. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul indicated a body length of 7 metres and a weight of 5 tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 231 Kenneth Carpenter estimated it smaller at 5 metres. Thomas Holtz gave a higher estimation at 9 meters suggesting that it was rivaling Ankylosaurus. Carpenter et al. (2001) established several distinguishing traits of Cedarpelta. The body of the praemaxilla, the front snout bone, is short in front of its nasal branch. The outer sides of the two praemaxillae run more parallel compared to the snouts of later forms which are strongly diverging to behind. The cutting edge of the bone core of the upper beak is limited to the front of the praemaxilla. Each praemaxilla has six (conical) teeth. The quadrate, and with it the entire back of the skull, is inclined to the front. The head of the quadrate is not fused with the paroccipital process, contrary to the situation in Shamosaurus. The neck of the occipital condyle is long and sticking out to behind, like with nodosaurids, not obliquely to below as in typical ankylosaurids. The tubera basilaria, appending processes of the rear lower braincase, form a large wedge directed to below. The pterygoid is elongated from the front to the rear and has a saddle-shaped process on its outer edge oriented to behind and sideways. The coronoid process of the rear lower jaw has an oval process at the inside. The straight ischium has a knob-shaped boss at the inside near the pubic pedicle. Cedarpelta shows a mix of basal (\\"primitive\\") and derived traits. The presence of premaxillary teeth is a plesiomorphic character because it is inherited from earlier Ornithischia. In contrast, closure of the opening on the side of the skull behind the orbit, the lateral temporal fenestra, is an advanced, derived (apomorphic) character only known in ankylosaurid ankylosaurians. Two skulls are known, and the skull length for Cedarpelta is estimated to have been roughly . One of the Cedarpelta skulls was found disarticulated, a first for an ankylosaur skull, allowing paleontologists a unique opportunity to examine the individual bones instead of being limited to an ossified unit. The skull is relatively elongated and does not show a strongly appending beak. Of the conical premaxillary teeth, the first is the largest. The maxilla bears eighteen teeth. The eye socket is surrounded by the lacrimal, a single supraorbital and a large postorbital, excluding the prefrontal and the jugal from the orbital rim. The postcranial skeleton was in 2001 not described in any detail. The skulls, though of large and thus not juvenile individuals, do not show a distinctive pattern of fused caputegulae, head tiles. This inspired Carpenter to propose an alternative hypothesis of ankylosaur skull osteoderm formation. Formerly, it had been assumed that such armour plates were either formed by direct skin ossification into distinct scutes which later fused to the skull (the more popular theory), or by a reaction of the skull bones to the pattern of overlying scales. The lack of a clear pattern in Cedarpelta suggested to Carpenter that the ossification took place in an intermediate layer between the scales and the skull roof itself, which he surmised to have been the periosteum. Phylogenetics Carpenter et al. (2001) placed the taxon within the family Ankylosauridae. They offered two interpretations of the position of Cedarpelta bilbeyhallorum in the evolutionary tree. The first was that it could be the basalmost known ankylosaurid, i.e. the first discovered branch to split off from the ankylosaurid stem line. This would be in line with its plesiomorphic traits and the fact that the in 2001 supposed Barremian age made it one of the oldest known ankylosaurids. The second was that it formed an early ankylosaurid branch, or clade, Shamosaurinae together with Gobisaurus domoculus of north- central China and the eponymous Shamosaurus scutatus of Mongolia. Vickaryous et al. (2004), however, interpreted the genus as the basalmost member of the family Nodosauridae, positioned even below the nodosaurids Pawpawsaurus campbelli, Silvisaurus condrayi, and Sauropelta edwardsorum.Vickaryous M.K., Marya≈Ñska T., Weishampel D.B., 2004, \\"Ankylosauria\\". Chapter 17 in: Weishampel D.B., Dodson P., Osm√≥lska H., editors. The Dinosauria. 2nd ed. Berkeley (CA): University of California Press. p. 363‚Äì392 However, new material of the skeleton confirms the original identification of Carpenter et al. of Cedarpelta being one of the most basal ankylosaurids. This was also a result of an analysis by Victoria Megan Arbour recovering Cedarpelta just above Gastonia, the most basal ankylosaurid in her study. No tail club of Cedarpelta is known, but Arbour stressed that early ankylosaurids might well have lacked a true club.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014.

Green was born at Llanengan, Caernarfonshire, in Wales. A fair-haired right- handed batsman often used as an opener and a medium-pace bowler, he went to Brasenose College, Oxford, from Manchester Grammar School and was a regular and successful player for three years from 1959 to 1961, turning out for Lancashire in his holidays. He scored 1,000 runs in his first season, but failed to do so in his other two university seasons, and again in 1962, when he played fairly often for Lancashire. After a year away playing in league cricket in 1963, he came back to Lancashire in 1964 and was a regular in the first team for three seasons. In 1965, with the benefit of playing in 35 first-class matches, he set a record that is unlikely ever to be beaten by scoring more than 2,000 runs without a single century: his highest for the season was 85. The previous highest number of runs in a season without a century was 1,709 by C.B. Harris in 1935, whilst not since 1970 has anyone scored 1,500 runs with no centuries in one season.Wisden 2017, pp. 202‚Äì4. After a more moderate season in 1966, he was injured and drifted out of the side in 1967, and was allowed to leave Lancashire at the end of the season to join Gloucestershire. Green's aggressive batting in 1968 for his new county had him belatedly touted as a possible England opener: he scored 2,137 runs at an average of more than 40 runs per innings. In the event, the only honour he received was to be selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1969. After two more modest seasons in 1969 and 1970, he gave up first-class cricket for a career in business and journalism, writing on cricket and rugby for The Daily Telegraph from 1982 to 2009.

The station's transmitter is located in Clarksville, New York. The station is owned by Wireless Access, LLC, a group of rural telephone companies in Upstate New York and Vermont. WVBG is licensed to operate in analog, but has a construction permit to flash cut to digital from a transmitter on the Helderberg Escarpment. History What is now WVBG-LP has its origins in a translator station on channel 4 serving Gilboa, Prattsville, and Roxbury, operated by the Board of Cooperative Educational Services of the Third Supervisory District of Delaware, Greene, and Schoharie counties and carrying programming from WMHT in Schenectady, WCNY-TV in Syracuse, and WNDT in New York City. The station, which was granted its construction permit in 1966, went on the air two years later as W04AS. On February 8, 1991, the Otsego-Northern Catskills BOCES transferred the station to the WSKG Public Telecommunications Council; by this point, W04AS was a translator for WSKG-TV in Binghamton. On May 17, 1996, WSKG filed an application to move W04AS to channel 25 in Albany, Schenectady, and Troy, New York, with a transmitter located on the Helderberg Escarpment. That July, Vision 3 Broadcasting announced that it would purchase W04AS and operate the station as the flagship of a group of three low-power television stations in the Capital District, along with W83AL (channel 83) in Andes (which would have also been acquired from WSKG and be converted into W21BU channel 21 in Hudson, Catskill, Hudson, and Chatham) and W02CJ (channel 2) in Manchester, Vermont (which was acquired from Ronald and Jan Morlino, two of Vision 3's principals, and converted to W39CE channel 39 in Glens Falls, Saratoga Springs, Easton, and Hudson Falls). The channel 21 signal was dropped from the network by 1997 after it was determined that its coverage area could be served with the channel 25 signal; by then, the group (which, despite each station operating on different channels, was branded simply \\"TV 25\\") also included W49BU (channel 49) in Manchester, Vermont. The move to channel 25 was granted a construction permit on October 2, 1997 and issued the call sign W25CF; on November 5, Vision 3's parent company Sharp Vision completed its purchase of the station from WSKG. The call letters were changed to WVBG-LP on December 12, 1997. Because of the delay in receiving the construction permit, channel 25 was the last of the three stations to go on the air; W39CE (later renamed WVBX-LP; now WEPT-CD channel 15 in Newburgh) signed on in December 1997, and W49BU (later renamed WVBK-LP; now WYCX-CD channel 2) went on in March 1998, with WVBG itself debuting on August 27, 1998. Initially an independent station, WVBG and its satellites became a UPN affiliate on October 5, 1998; it already carried the UPN Kids block, but the network's primetime programming had previously been seen in the Capital District through secondary affiliations with Fox affiliate WXXA-TV (channel 23) and Pax station WYPX (channel 55), as well as cable carriage of WSBK-TV from Boston. However, from its inception, the station could not get carriage on Time Warner Cable, which chose to continue its carriage of WSBK; this was despite acquiring several sports packages, including Big East football and basketball, the Boston Red Sox (the telecasts of which were dropped following a territorial complaint by the New York Yankees), and the Boston Celtics. WVBG-LP changed its city of license to Greenwich, New York on April 22, 1999 (Greenwich had earlier been added as a fourth city of license after Albany, Schenectady, and Troy); this helped Vision 3 win must-carry rights in Washington County on December 3, 1999. However, the UPN affiliation ended at the start of 2000 when cable-only \\"WEDG-TV\\" (known later as \\"UPN 4\\") signed on as a joint operation between Time Warner Cable and WXXA. WVBG would then revert to being an independent station, heavily emphasizing its status as a primarily over-the-air station; that June, Vision 3 put WVBG and WVBX up for sale, and by 2001 much of the station's schedule was taken up by Resort Sports Network programming. On June 28, 2001, WVBG-LP was sold to Wireless Access, a group of telephone companies in the region, as part of plans to introduce wireless Internet service. However, the plan was never implemented, and by early 2003 channel 25 had gone off the air; it returned a year later airing color bars. On September 2, 2005, WVBG was granted a construction permit to move to channel 41. The station lost its transmitter site lease on November 30, 2006, forcing the station off-the-air until getting special temporary authority to operate from a new location in Clarksville (the proposed site for the channel 41 operation) a year later. Broadcasting on channel 25 ended on August 10, 2008; on September 3, the station filed for a license to cover construction of the channel 41 facility. On September 15, 2009, WVBG was granted a construction permit to flash cut to digital operation; this facility will change the station's city of license back to Albany and return the transmitter to the Helderberg Escarpment. WVBG lost access to its tower in Clarksville on April 8, 2010 due to an ownership dispute involving the tower, forcing the station to suspend broadcasting; it returned to the air on April 6, 2011 from another nearby tower under special temporary authority.

It lived about 69 to 66 million years ago, in the Maastrichtian division of the Late Cretaceous. It weighed roughly 700 kg (1540 lb). The fossil evidence from Jabalpur, India, includes the now-lostS. Chatterjee, 1978, \\"Indosuchus and Indosaurus, Cretaceous carnosaurs from India\\", Journal of Paleontology 52(3): 570-580 holotype GSI K27/565, a partial skull of unusual thickness found by Charles Alfred Matley in the Lameta Formation; other parts of the skeleton have later been referred to it. The cranium suggests that Indosaurus may have had horns above its eyes, although all the fossil evidence has since been lost. Indosaurus may have been related to the unusual South American dinosaur, Carnotaurus. If this is the case, then India had not been a separate continent for the previous 100 million years, as many paleontologists had thought. Instead, the two land masses possibly were connected intermittently by land bridges, allowing dinosaurs from both areas to migrate. The type species, Indosaurus matleyi, was named by Huene and Matley in 1933.F. von Huene and C. A. Matley, 1933, \\"The Cretaceous Saurischia and Ornithischia of the Central Provinces of India\\", Palaeontologica Indica (New Series), Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India 21(1): 1-74 The generic name refers to India. The specific name honours Matley. This species now also includes Megalosaurus matleyi; confusingly, the dubious tooth taxon Orthogoniosaurus shares the same specific name (but is based on different material). Some paleontologists have speculated that Indosuchus and Compsosuchus should also be included within Indosaurus.

Although the station is called \\"Sandbach railway station\\", the actual location of the station is on the A533 road from Sandbach to Middlewich and Northwich in the local residential suburb of Elworth. History Sandbach was a double junction on the LNWR and later London Midland and Scottish Railway line from Crewe to Manchester. For many years, Sandbach was a junction for the single line branch to Middlewich and Northwich railway station; opening on 1 July 1868,Herapath's Railway Journal, Punl. Aug 15, 1868, page 829. it closed for passenger service in January 1960, but it still carries freight on a daily basis. Even earlier, the North Staffordshire Railway branch from Kidsgrove to Sandbach via Lawton Junction ceased passenger service in July 1930 and closed to freight traffic in 1964. Services On Monday to Saturday during the daytime there are two trains per hour to Crewe southbound, one per hour to Manchester Piccadilly and one per hour to Liverpool Lime Street northbound. The Piccadilly service goes via Stockport (calls at all stations en route) and the Liverpool service via Styal and St Helens Junction (calling at all stations en route). There is an hourly service during the evening in each direction via Stockport. On Sundays there is a two-hourly service in each direction, northbound via Stockport. Sandbach has three platforms :- *Platform 1 is the Main Platform for trains to Crewe *Platform 2 is the Main Platform for services to Manchester Piccadilly. *Platform 3 is a bidirectional platform, which used on weekday mornings. Facilities The station has a ticket office on platform 1; this is manned part-time on Mondays to Saturdays only (Monday - Friday 06:30 - 13:00 Saturday 07:20 - 13:50). Outside these times, tickets must be purchased prior to travel or on board the train. A waiting room on platforms 2 and 3 is open at the times the station is staffed, whilst there are shelters on both sides. Train running details are offered via timetable posters, digital CIS displays and by telephone. No step-free access is available, as the footbridge to platforms 2 and 3 does not have ramps and the Crewe platform has steps from the car park.

Biography Fuller was born on January 20, 1876, in Prophetstown, Whiteside County, Illinois to Wilmont P. and Maria (Ocobock) Fuller. In 1885 he moved to Arkansas with his parents, who settled on a farm near Eureka Springs. He attended the public schools. He worked as a boot black and as a janitor at the school where he enrolled. He dropped out of high school, took a better job in Chicago for a while and saved his money. Desiring to be a lawyer, he finished high school in Eureka Springs in 1896 at the age of twenty; went back to Chicago to attend the Kent School of Law; and returned to Eureka Springs to study law at the office of C. G. White. He then took the bar examination in open court, and on February 5, 1898, he was admitted to the bar and became a practicing lawyer. He married May Obenshain on December 25, 1899, and they had three children, one of whom died in infancy. Career Becoming city clerk of Eureka Springs from 1898 to 1902, Fuller was then elected member of the State house of representatives from 1903 to 1905. He was mayor of Eureka Springs from 1906 to 1910 and from 1920 to 1928. He served as prosecuting attorney of the fourth Arkansas judicial district from 1910 to 1914, and as president of the Eureka Springs School Board from 1916 to 1928.

Historically, biographers have been limited to those who specialized in literary works on important personalities or those officially commissioned by a living person or if deceased, by the estate to provide a biography of that person. In recent years, the term \\"celebrity biographer\\" has come into existence. ForeWord Magazine notes that \\"There is the literary biographer and the celebrity biographer.\\" Designed to be entertainment, books by celebrity biographers are often referred to as \\"quickie\\" biographies due to the limited amount of research done vis-√†-vis that of a literary biographer. Books about celebrities have existed for many years but the advent of the personal computer (PC) reduced writing and editing costs substantially. Combined with the Internet, that provided massive sources and easy contact, the PC created an explosion of celebrity books beginning in the early 1990s. Because of these technological tools, early writers on celebrities such as Fred Lawrence Guiles who wrote \\"Norma Jean; the life of Marilyn Monroe\\" in 1969 were able to substantially increase their book output while some newer celebrity biographers produce a book almost on an annual basis. Celebrity biographies are published by small specialty publishers as well as major publishing houses, sometimes through an imprint. It can be a very profitable sideline and for some small publishing houses it is an important supplemental source of revenue that keeps them afloat in the highly competitive book market. This is the case for small presses such as ECW Press who advertise that they publish \\"biographies of today's best-known rock stars, writers, artists, and television personalities.\\" Legal actions By the mid-1990s, fierce competition in the celebrity biography field developed that brought even more sensationalist claims. Statutes in the United States and other countries prohibit libel lawsuits for anything written or said about a deceased person and some celebrity biographers have taken advantage of this to make questionable assertions. In certain egregious cases, respected book reviewers such as Publishers Weekly have gone out of their way to caution readers by noting that the subjects are \\"conveniently for legal purposes, are deceased.\\" a number of which led to lawsuits. However, for living people, the courts can and have become involved when the subject of a book believes their character has been deliberately harmed. Such was the case with the unauthorized biography \\"Clint: The Life and Legend\\" by Patrick McGilligan. First published in the UK and then in the United States in 2002 by St. Martin's Press. Eastwood filed a $10 million libel action in U.S. District Court in San Jose, California against the author and publisher, claiming the book was riddled with fabrications and insulting statements and that at least one of the author's primary sources was dubious at best. In response, McGilligan, who had written unauthorized biographies on film personalities James Cagney, Jack Nicholson, and Fritz Lang, told the Associated Press that \\"He (Eastwood) has sued people religiously\\" and \\"He's made a career of suppressing dissidence.\\" However, McGilligan and St. Martin's Press settled Eastwood's libel claim out of court and agreed to make changes to the book prescribed by Eastwood and agreed to remove certain claims in all future printings. Saturday, 14 January 2017 In other cases such as that of celebrity biographer Cliff Goodwin, his book titled \\"Catherine Zeta-Jones: The Biography\\" was canceled by Virgin Books just a few weeks before its December 2003 scheduled release. Goodwin had previously made unsubstantiated claims about Catherine Zeta-Jones and her legal counsel notified the author and publisher that legal action would be instituted if the book was published. = Some celebrity biographers = *Ellis Amburn *Christopher Andersen *David Bret *Roberto Chiesi *Suzanne Finstad *Albert Goldman *Cliff Goodwin *Boze Hadleigh *Laura Jackson *Kitty Kelley *Jeff Lenburg *Patrick McGilligan *James Robert Parish *Lawrence J.

Biography Kerry Max Cook was born in Stuttgart, West Germany, and moved to Texas with his family in 1972. He served over 20 years in a Texas prison on Death Row. Since his release, he has become an activist against the death penalty, speaking across the United States and in Europe. Cook wrote Chasing Justice, which was published by HarperCollins in 2008, that details his conviction, the widespread prosecutorial abuses which led to it, and the battle to prove his innocence. Chasing Justice was nominated for the Edgar Award by Mystery Writers of America. He was awarded a Soros Justice Fellowship to write the book. In an advance blurb for the memoir, former FBI Director and Federal Judge William S. Sessions noted, \\"Kerry Max Cook has written a brutal but compelling account of his 22 years on Texas‚Äôs death row for a murder he did not commit. The book depicts his struggles against all odds to free himself from an inept justice system that would not let go, despite mounting and eventually overwhelming evidence of his innocence. What is perhaps most amazing is the grace with which he now lives his life as a free man, determined to prevent others from suffering the horrors he endured.\\" Cook is one of six people whose stories were dramatized in the play The Exonerated by Eric Jensen and Jessica Blank. This details how each individual was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, in addition to their exoneration after varying years of imprisonment. Cook often personally participates in the play. The Exonerated has been made into a film, which first aired on the CourtTV cable television station on January 27, 2005. Kerry Cook is portrayed by Aidan Quinn in the film. At the end the film fades from the actor to Cook himself who talks about his experience, his family and his book writing. Although he is out of prison, Cook still lives in a perpetually liminal state. Although he has never admitted guilt, he is still considered a convicted murderer in the eyes of Texas law, which adversely affects his daily life. Cook and his lawyer Marc McPeak have embarked on a new legal endeavor to clear his name: a motion to perform DNA tests on physical evidence found at the murder scene. McPeak also filed a motion to recuse Judge Jack Skeen, the former district attorney who prosecuted Cook's first two trials, as Skeen would be the one to hear the DNA-testing motion. On April 9, 2012, Administrative Judge John Ovard of Dallas granted Cook's request for DNA testing but denied his plea to move the case out of Smith County, where prosecutors who originally tried his case were found by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to have committed \\"egregious prosecutorial misconduct.\\" Cook's battle to clear his name has been taken up by the online petition site Change.org. On June 6, 2016, prosecutors agreed to drop the charges against Kerry Max Cook; this was motivated in part by James Mayfield's admission that he had lied about not having sex with the victim for weeks.

Increasing demand for services such as mobile telephones and many others has required changes in the philosophy of spectrum management. Demand for wireless broadband has soared due to technological innovation, such as 3G and 4G mobile services, and the rapid expansion of wireless internet services.Reed, Jeffrey, Marius Vassiliou, and Syed Shah (2016). ‚ÄúThe Role of New Technologies in Solving the Spectrum Shortage.‚Äù Proceedings of the IEEE, Vol. 104 No. 6, 1163-1168. Since the 1930s, spectrum was assigned through administrative licensing. Limited by technology, signal interference was once considered as a major problem of spectrum use. Therefore, exclusive licensing was established to protect licensees' signals. This former practice of discrete bands licensed to groups of similar services is giving way, in many countries, to a \\"spectrum auction\\" model that is intended to speed technological innovation and improve the efficiency of spectrum use. During the experimental process of spectrum assignment, other approaches have also been carried out, namely, lotteries, unlicensed access, and privatization of spectrum. Most recently, America has been moving toward a shared spectrum policy, whereas Europe has been pursuing an authorized shared access (ASA) licensing model. President Obama made shared spectrum the policy of the United States on 14 June 2013,Obama, Barack, ‚ÄúPresidential Memorandum -- Expanding America's Leadership in Wireless Innovation,‚Äù Washington, D. C.: White House Office of the Press Secretary, June 14, 2013. https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press- office/2013/06/14/presidential-memorandum-expanding-americas-leadership- wireless-innovatio following recommendations from the President's Council of Advisors for Science and Technology (PCAST) which advocated the sharing of (uncleared) federal radio spectrum when unused at a place and time provided it does not pose undue risks. In line with this guidance, as of Dec 2014 the FCC was extending the limited success of television band spectrum sharing (TV white space) into other bands, significantly into the 3550‚Äì3700 MHz US Navy radar band via a three tier licensing model (incumbent, priority, and general access). Governments and spectrum management Most countries consider RF spectrum as an exclusive property of the state. The RF spectrum is a national resource, much like water, land, gas and minerals. Unlike these, however, RF is reusable.Radio Spectrum as Natural Resource The purpose of spectrum management is to mitigate radio spectrum pollution, and maximize the benefit of usable radio spectrum.Application of the Public-Trust Doctrine and Principles of Natural Resource Management to Electromagnetic Spectrum The first sentence of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) constitution fully recognises \\"the sovereign right of each State to regulate its telecommunication\\". Effective spectrum management requires regulation at national, regional, and global levels. Goals of spectrum management include: rationalize and optimize the use of the RF spectrum; avoid and solve interference; design short and long range frequency allocations; advance the introduction of new wireless technologies; coordinate wireless communications with neighbours and other administrations. Radio spectrum items which need to be nationally regulated: frequency allocation for various radio services, assignment of license and RF to transmitting stations, type approval of equipment (for countries out of the European Union), fee collection, notifying ITU for the Master International Frequency Register (MIFR), coordination with neighbour countries (as there are no borders to the radio waves), external relations toward regional commissions (such as CEPT in Europe, CITEL in America) and toward ITU. Spectrum use Spectrum management is a growing problem due to the growing number of spectrum uses.K. Kotobi, P. B. Mainwaring, and S. G. Bilen, \\"Puzzle-based auction mechanism for spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks\\", Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob), 2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on, October 2016. Uses include: over-the-air broadcasting, (which started in 1920); government and research uses (which include defense, public safety‚Äîmaritime, air, police‚Äîresource management, transport, and radio astronomy); commercial services to the public (including voice, data, home networking); and industrial, scientific and medical services (which include Telemedicine, and remote control). In the 1980s, the only concern was about radio and television broadcasting; but today mobile phones and wireless computer networks are more and more important as fewer than 15% of US households rely on over-the-air broadcasting to receive their TV signals.Annual Assessment of the Status of Competition in the Market for the Delivery of Video Programming; FCC tenth annual report ; (2004); accessed June 2018 The US spectrum is managed either by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for non-governmental applications or by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for governmental applications. For shared application, both entities should agree. The spectrum is divided into different frequency bands, each having a specific application. For instance, the frequency band that covers 300 kHz to 535 kHz is reserved for aeronautical and maritime communications and the spectrum from 535 kHz and 1605 kHz for AM radio. This process is called \\"allocation\\". The next step is to assign frequencies to specific users or classes of users. Each frequency band has a specific assignment that depends on the nature of the application and the numbers of users. Indeed, some applications require a wider band than others (AM radio uses blocks of 10 kHz where FM radio uses blocks of 200 kHz). In addition, \\"guard bands\\" are needed to keep the interference between applications to a minimum.Digital Crossroads - American Telecommunications Policy in the Internet Age - J. Nuechterlein & P. Weiser  Status quo: the command and control approach  The Command and Control management approach is the one currently employed by most regulators around the globe. This approach advocates that the regulators be the centralized authorities for spectrum allocation and usage decisions. In the US example, the regulator (FCC) determines the use cases for specified spectrum portions, as well as the parties who will have access to them. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also regulates the physical layer technologies to be employed.S. Galicia, M. Sirbu, and J. Peha, \\"A narrowband approach to efficient pcs spectrum sharing through decentralized DCA access policies,\\" IEEE Personal Communications Magazine, pp. 24-34, February 1997. The allocation decisions are often static in temporal and spatial dimensions, meaning that they are valid for extended periods of time (usually decades) and for large geographical regions (country wide). The usage is often set to be exclusive; each band is dedicated to a single provider, thus maintaining interference free communication. The command and control management model dates back to initial days of wireless communications, when the technologies employed required interference-free mediums for achieving acceptable quality. Thus, it is often argued that the exclusive nature of the command and control approach is an artifact of outdated technologies. The apparent advantages of this model is that services related to public interest could be sustained. In terms of profitability, public interest programs, for example, over-the-air television, may not be as attractive as commercial ones in the provider perspective, but they are nevertheless beneficial for the society. Therefore, these services are often implicitly enforced by the regulator through the license agreements. Another advantage is the standardization that results from such a centralized approach. Such standardization is critical in networked industries, for which the telecommunication industry is a text-book example.J. Peha, \\"Spectrum management policy options,\\" 1998. One scholar has published a paper that shows how the development of new technologies promises to bring considerably more spectrum to the public, but would require that society embrace a new paradigm of spectrum use.[SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=732483 Wireless Communications and Computing at a Crossroads: New Paradigms and Their Impact on Theories Governing the Public's Right to Spectrum Access], Patrick S. Ryan, Journal on Telecommunications & High Technology Law, Vol. 3, No. 2, p. 239, 2005. = GAO Report on Spectrum Management (2004) = Excerpt: Alternative spectrum governance regimes and the spectrum debate With the digital transition, spectrum management entered a new age. Full conversion to digital TV by 17 February 2009 (Digital Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005) allows broadcasters to use spectrum more efficiently and save space for the possibility of sharing spectrum. Spectrum sharing is the subject of heated discussion. Exponential growth of commercial wireless calls for additional spectrum to accommodate more traffic. As a regulator, the FCC responded to these needs by making more spectrum available. A secondary market has been allowed to emerge and licensees are encouraged to lease use of the spectrum to third parties temporarily. Making licenses transferable is an important attempt by the FCC to create incentives for broadcasters to share unused spectrum. Another proposed solution to the spectrum scarcity problem is to enable communications systems to occupy spectrum that was previously allocated for radar use and to cooperatively share spectrum. This approach has received increased attention recently with several research programs, including DARPA projects, investigating several methods of cooperative radar-communications spectrum sharing. More alternatives are underway such as spectrum sharing in cellular networks.F. Foukalas and T. Khattab, \\"Multi-User Diversity with Optimal Power Allocation in Spectrum Sharing under Average Interference Power Constraint.\\" I 2014 IEEE 79th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Spring), May 2014) Spectrum scarcity has emerged as a primary problem encountered when trying to launch new wireless services. The effects of this scarcity are most noticeable in spectrum auctions where the operators often need to invest billions of dollars to secure access to specified bands in the available spectrum. In spite of this scarcity, recent spectrum utilization measurements have shown that the available spectrum opportunities are severely underutilized, i.e. left unused. This artificial \\"access limitation\\"-based scarcity is often considered to result from the static and rigid nature of the command and control governance regime. Interested parties have started to consider possible improvements in the governance regime by relaxing the constraints on spectrum access. Two prevailing models are the \\"spectrum commons\\" and the \\"spectrum property rights\\" approaches. =Spectrum commons theory= Under US law, the spectrum is not considered to be the property of the private sector nor of the government except insofar as the term \\"government\\" is used to be synonymous with \\"the people\\". The original use of the term \\"the commons\\" was the practice by which the public at large had limited rights to use the commons; each person then had an interest in their own usage rights, but the commons themselves were not property, nor were the rights \\"property\\" since they could not be traded. The term \\"tragedy of the commons\\" was popularized by Garrett Hardin in a 1968 article which appeared in Science. The tragedy of the commons illustrates the philosophy that destructive use of public reservations (\\"the commons\\") by private interests can result when the best strategy for individuals conflicts with the \\"common good\\". In such a scenario, it asserts that even though the contribution of each \\"bad actor\\" may be minute, when the results of these actions are combined the resource could be degraded to the point of uselessness. This concern has led to the regulation of the spectrum. = Spectrum property rights model = The spectrum property rights model advocates that the spectrum resources should be treated like land, i.e. private ownership of spectrum portions should be permitted. The allocation of these portions should be implemented by means of market forces. The spectrum owners should be able to trade these portions in secondary markets. Alternatively, the spectrum owners would be able to use their bands in any way they want through any technology they prefer (service and technology neutrality). Although the spectrum property rights model advocates exclusive allocation of transmission rights, it is not the same as a licensed regime. The main difference is the service and technology neutrality advocated in the spectrum property rights approach, as opposed to strict requirements on services and communications technologies inherent in licensed governance regimes. The basic idea of spectrum property rights was first proposed by Leo Herzel in 1951,L. Herzel, \\"'Public interest' and the market in color television regulation\\", University of Chicago Law Review who was a law student at the time, preparing a critique of the US FCC policies in spectrum management. Ronald Coase, a Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist, championed the idea of auctioning off spectrum rights as a superior alternative to the status quo in 1959.R. H. Coase, \\"The Federal Communications Commission\\", Journal of Law and Economics, vol. 2., pp. 1-40, Oct. 1959 Coase argued that, though initial distributions may affect matters, property rights in a frequency will lead to the most efficient usage thereof. When he first presented his vision to the FCC, he was asked whether he was making a joke. The supporters of the spectrum property rights model argue that such a management scheme would potentially promote innovation and more efficient use of spectrum resources, as the spectrum owners would potentially want to economize on their resources.G. R. Faulhaber and D. Farber, \\"Spectrum management: Property rights, markets, and the commons,\\" in Telecommunications Policy Research Conference Proceedings, 2003.J. Peha, \\"Spectrum management policy options\\", 1998 The spectrum property rights model is often critiqued for potentially leading to artificial scarcity and the hold-up problem. The hold-up problem refers to the difficulty in aggregation of the spectrum resources (which would be required for high bandwidth applications), as the individual spectrum owners could ask for very high compensation in return of their contribution.G. R. Faulhaber, \\"The question of spectrum: Technology, management and regime change,\\" in The Conference on the Economics, Technology and Policy of Unlicensed Spectrum, East Lansing, MI, 2005. Since spectrum is a scarce finite good, there is a perverse incentive to not use it at all. Participants and existing spectrum owners in the spectrum market can preemptively buy spectrum, then warehouse it to prevent existing or newcomer competitors from utilizing it. The existing spectrum owner's official plans for this warehoused spectrum would be save it for an unknown future use, and therefore not utilize it at all for the foreseeable future. In a partial or incomplete \\"spectrum as property\\" regulatory regime, incumbent and grandfathered owners who obtained spectrum under the old cause and merit policy, can obtain windfalls in selling the spectrum they obtained for no cost under the earlier regulatory regime. When a regulatory regime changes to the property model, the original merit and cause guidelines for incumbent and grandfathered users are often removed. No regulatory review mechanism exists to check if the merit guidelines are still being followed, and if not, to then revoke the spectrum license from the incumbent spectrum owner and reissue the spectrum to a new user under old merit guidelines, or sell the spectrum inline with the new \\"spectrum as property\\" policy. U.S. regulatory agencies The Communications Act of 1934 grants authority for spectrum management to the President for all federal use (47 USC 305). The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) manages the spectrum for the Federal Government. Its rules are found in the NTIA Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management\\". The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) manages and regulates all domestic non-federal spectrum use (47 USC 301).Rules & Regulations; FCC website; accessed June 2018 Background: * Radio Act of 1927 * Communications Act of 1934 * Administrative Procedures Act of 1947 * Communications Satellite Act of 1962 * National Telecommunications and Information Administration * Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 * Cable TV Consumer Protection & Competition Act of 1992 * Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 * Telecommunications Act of 1996 International spectrum management The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is the part of the United Nations (UN) that manages the use of both the RF Spectrum and space satellites among nation states. The Plenipotentiary Conference is the top policy-making body of the ITU, meeting every four years in order to set the Union's general policies. The ITU is divided into three Sectors: the Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) determines the technical characteristics and operational procedures for wireless services, and plays a vital role in the Spectrum Management of the radio- frequency; ITU-R Study Group 1 is the Spectrum Management study group; the Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) develops internationally agreed technical and operating standards; and the Telecommunication Development Sector (ITU-D) fosters the expansion of telecommunications infrastructure in developing nations throughout the world, that make up two- thirds of the ITU's 191 Member States. The ITU Radio Regulations set a binding international treaty governing the use of the radio spectrum by some 40 different services. Frequency Administration In telecommunication, frequency assignment authority is the power granted for the administration, designation or delegation to an agency or administrator via treaty or law, to specify frequencies, frequency channels or frequency bands, in the electromagnetic spectrum for use in radiocommunication services, radio stations or ISM applications. Frequency administration is ‚Äì according to Article 1.2 of the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR)ITU Radio Regulations, Chapter I, Section I, General terms ‚Äì article 1.2, definition: administration / frequency administration ‚Äì defined as ¬´Any governmental department or service responsible for discharging the obligations undertaken in the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union, in the Convention of the International Telecommunication Union and in the Administrative Regulations (CS 1002).¬ª Definitions identical to those contained in the Annex to the Constitution or the Annex to the Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (Geneva, 1992) are marked \\"(CS)\\" or \\"(CV)\\" respectively. International frequency assignment authority is vested in the Radiocommunication Bureau of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). =Europe= * In Europe each country has regulatory input into the progress of European and international policy, standards, and legislation governing these sectors through their respective frequency administration. * European frequency administrations might receive military advice by the appropriate National Radio Frequency Agency (NRFA). Pertaining to NATO-Europe, this expertise is within the Spectrum Consultation Command and Control & Infrastructure Branch (SC3IB). However, the decision making body, pertaining to military access to the radio frequency spectrum, is the NATO Civ/Mil Spectrum Capability Panel 3 (CaP3), on behalf of the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Board (C3B), with participation of competent, authorised and mandated representatives of national frequency administrations. * Civil frequency management for Europe is driven by a number of organisations. These include the: ** European Union (EU) ** Independent Regulator's Group (IRG) ** European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) http://www.cept.org CEPT Website ** European Radiocommunications Office (ERO) http://www.ero.dk ERO Website In July 2002, the European Commission also established the European Regulators Group for Electronic Communications Networks and Services; creating, for the first time, a formal structure for interaction and coordination between the European Commission and regulators in all EU Member States to ensure consistent application of European legislation. =United States= In the United States, primary frequency assignment authority is exercised by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) for the Federal Government and by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for non- Federal Government organizations.

During World War II, the two facilities were combined as the Ravenna Arsenal. The Ravenna Arsenal had an immediate effect upon the communities of Portage County. Over 14,000 people were employed at the Arsenal during World War II, and the village of Windham was chosen as the site to house many of these workers. Windham experienced a population boom as a result; its growth of over 1200% was the largest of any U.S. municipality in the 1950 Census, as was reported in the June 1951 edition of National Geographic Magazine.Windham Exempted Village School District (1998).

In November 1945, control of the facility was transferred from Atlas Powder to the U.S. Army. The facility continued to be in operation on a limited basis. During the Korean War, the Ravenna Arsenal resumed full operations. In 1951, Firestone won several defense contracts, among which was operation of the facility under a subsidiary, Ravenna Arsenal, Inc. The facility once again was placed on standby in 1957. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the forerunner to NASA, then commenced aeronautical experiments at the facility. Among these experiments was aircraft crash testing, which led to the development of an inerting system to prevent jet fuel fires.National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Glenn Research Center. Aircraft Crash Testing. Retrieved October 24, 2007. The Ravenna Arsenal was used for the last time for the production of ammunition during the Vietnam War. In 1971, the facility was again placed on standby. Ammunition at the facility was then demilitarized, a process which continued until 1984. It also was part of ammunition refurbishment and minor research and development projects until 1992. After years of inactivity, the facility became a Superfund site and plans to burn some of the buildings at the site were being discussed. However, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) work group recommended that the Army not burn the buildings due to the high levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the paint.Downing, Bob. \\"Burning Ravenna Arsenal Unlikely: EPA Group Against Use of Fire Because of PCBs in Old Paint\\". The Akron Beacon Journal, September 1, 2006. Cleanup of the site is expected to continue through 2018. Meanwhile, transfer of the facility was ultimately made to the Ohio National Guard, although there were several intermediate caretakers. In 1983, Firestone sold its contract to Physics International Company. Ten years later, Mason & Hangar-Silas Mason Company, Inc. assumed caretaker status. The Ravenna Training and Logistics Site of the Ohio National Guard began as a tenant unit of the Army facility, which at that time was officially designated the Ravenna Army Ammunition Plant (RVAAP). of the facility were included in the RTLS tenancy by May 16, 1999. On January 16, 2002, transfer of this land was made to the RTLS, and the RVAAP became a tenant site of the RTLS - essentially switching the roles of the two facilities.

Garfield lived in Portage County for many years prior to his election as president, and as a state senator in the 1860s, helped appropriate funds to create the Ohio volunteer forces, the precursor to the Ohio National Guard. In popular culture The essayist Scott Russell Sanders spent part of his childhood living on the grounds of the Ravenna Arsenal. The Arsenal figures prominently in his memoirs The Paradise of Bombs (1987) and A Private History of Awe (2006). The Hole in the Horn Buck is officially listed as the second largest non-typical white-tailed deer of all time by the Boone and Crockett Club. The buck‚Äôs antlers score 328 2/8 non- typical points. The name of the buck derives from the mysterious hole in the buck‚Äôs right antler. It was later claimed by eyewitness, George Winters, to be caused from a piece of chain-link fence that pierced the antler shortly before it died. The world record white-tailed deer was stuck under the fence to the Ravenna Arsenal in 1940. The site can be seen in Marvel's 2014 film Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

The holotype and only known specimen (Museo Paleontol√≥gico Egidio Feruglio MPEF-PV 1716) was collected from an erosional exposure of fluvial sandstone within the Ca√±ad√≥n Calc√°reo Formation on a hill approximately north-northeast of Cerro C√≥ndor, Chubut Province, in west-central Argentina, South America. Though very incomplete, the skeletal elements recovered were found in articulation and include eight cervical, twelve dorsal, and three sacral vertebrae, as well as proximal portions of the posterior cervical ribs and all the dorsal ribs, the distal end of the left femur, the proximal end of the left tibia, and the right ilium. Much of the specimen was probably lost to erosion many years before its discovery. The type species is Brachytrachelopan mesai. The specific name honours Daniel Mesa, a local shepherd who discovered the specimen while searching for lost sheep. The genus name translates as \\"short-necked Pan\\", Pan being the god of the shepherds.  Description  Life restoration of Brachytrachelopan mesai This taxon's very short neck (approximately 40% shorter than other dicraeosaurids and the shortest of any known sauropod) is evidence that this lineage specialized to fill an ecological niche not exploited by other members of this infraorder. Small for a sauropod, Brachytrachelopan measured less than in length. Rauhut et al. (2005, 670) note that the high degree of fusion present between the preserved neural arches and their respective centra, as well as fusion between the sacral centra, sacral neural arches, and sacral neural spines is evidence that the holotype does not represent a juvenile animal. Hence, the small body size is not a relic of ontogeny. = Distinguishing characteristics = Rauhut et al. (2005, 670) diagnose Brachytrachelopan as differing from all other sauropods in the following respects: \\"...individual cervical vertebrae being as long as, or shorter in anteroposterior length than, high posteriorly. Further apomorphies...include a pronounced, pillar-like centropostzygapophyseal lamina in the cervical vertebrae, a pronounced anterior inclination in the mid-cervical neural spines, with the tip of the spine extending beyond the anterior end of the centrum, and anterior dorsal neural spines one to six with vertical bases and anteriorly flexed tips.\\"  Classification  Brachytrachelopan belongs to Sauropoda and Neosauropoda from the group of Diplodocoidea and family Dicraeosauridae. Following a cladistic analysis of 27 sauropod taxa and 154 anatomical characters, Rauhut et al. (2005, 671-672; Fig. 2) assigned Brachytrachelopan to the Dicraeosauridae, proposing that, within this clade, it should be considered to have a sister group relationship to the Late Jurassic African taxon Dicraeosaurus, instead of to Amargasaurus from the Lower Cretaceous of South America. Rauhut et al. (2005, 671) conclude this is indicative of a rapid evolutionary radiation and dispersal of the Dicraeosauridae following the separation of the continents of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres during the latest Middle Jurassic. The following cladogram by Tschopp and colleagues (2015) shows the presumed relationships between members of the Dicraeosauridae: Size comparison of Brachytrachelopan, Amargasaurus, Dicraeosaurus and a human  Paleoecology  Restoration of a pair Rauhut and colleagues in 2005 noted that the tendency towards shorter- necks seen in dicraeosaurids, and most evident in Brachytrachelopan, runs counter to the lengthening of the neck seen in most sauropod lineages (brachiosaurids, titanosaurs, diplodocids, etc.) and indicates that this group of sauropods was \\"progressively adapting for low browsing and might have been specialized on specific food sources, as has been suggested for Amargasaurus and Dicraeosaurus.\\" Moreover, the morphology of the cervical neural arches in Brachytrachelopan would have significantly restricted dorsal flexion of neck and most likely indicates that this sauropod was specialized to a diet of plants \\"growing at heights of between about 1 and 2 m.\\" Rauhut and colleagues also suggested that diet may have been a limiting factor in body size among dicraeosaurids, and that this may have placed them in the same ecological niche as \\"large low-browsing iguanodontian ornithopods.\\" Such large iguanodontians are absent from the Late Jurassic Gondwanan sediments that have produced all known fossils of dicraeosaurids, while they are abundant in similar ecosystems of the same age in North America, where dicraeosaurids are absent. This may indicate that large iguanodontians and dicraeosaurids (especially Brachytrachelopan) were ecological analogs, resulting from parallel evolution in two distantly related dinosaurian lineages.
