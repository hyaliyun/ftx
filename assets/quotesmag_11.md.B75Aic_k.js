It has been part off the tourism discourse since the 1970s, with attention growing in recent years due to debates on overtourism. Impacts are not easily categorized, having direct and indirect components. Tourism is also often seasonal, and impacts only become apparent over time, with varying effects, and at different stages of development.Pearce, D. G., & Butler, R. W. (1993). Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge. Tourism impacts fall into three main categories. Environmental impacts affect the carrying capacity of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the water table, wildlife, and natural phenomena. Sociocultural impacts are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods. The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. Economic impacts are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \\"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\\". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M. Needham (ed.), Parks and Protected Areas in Canada: Planning and Management (4th ed) (p. 391-425) Toronto: Oxford University Press. Yet these impacts can also contribute to high living costs within the community, pushing out local businesses, and raising costs for local residents. Environmental impacts Ecotourism, nature tourism, wildlife tourism, and adventure tourism take place in environments such as rain forests, high alpine, wilderness, lakes and rivers, coastlines and marine environments, as well as rural villages and coastline resorts. Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased awareness of environmental stewardship.Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \\"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\\". Tourism Management, 57, 362‚Äì372. The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long- term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect. = Facility impacts = Facility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \\"exploration\\" to \\"involvement\\" and then into the \\"development\\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.Butler, R. W. (1980). \\"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\\". The Canadian Geographer/Le G√©ographe canadien, 24(1), 5‚Äì12. During latter phase, there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of superstructure such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructures such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, waste disposal, and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. Noise pollution has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and light pollution can disrupt the feeding and reproductive behavior of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General waste and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates waste plastic and non-biodegradable products. = Tourist activities = Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s. Practically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as hiking the local ecology. There are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and camping that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of trails through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.Marion, J.L. (1998). \\"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\\". Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference, 18‚Äì21 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188‚Äì196. Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of non-native species.Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \\"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\\". Journal of Park and Recreation Administration, 19(3), 17‚Äì37. Indirect impacts on trails include changes in soil porosity, changes to microflora composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management. John Wiley & Sons. As many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random campsites. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding campfires. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems. In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay. As with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment. Tourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become an available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed. Examples of invasive species spread by tourism: * Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the ‚Äúworld's 100 worst‚Äù invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. * Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don‚Äôt allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. * Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations. There are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats. Another activity that can have severe direct and indirect impacts on the environment is wildlife viewing. This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as Kenya, Botswana, and Tanzania have been popular for many years. Their focus are the big five game megafauna: the African lion, African elephant, African leopard, cape buffalo, and rhinoceros. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and stress hormones of even the largest animal. Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, baboons and hyenas have learnt to track tourist safari vehicles to lead them to cheetah kills, which they then steal.Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \\"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\\", (No. 10). Iied. This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the food webs and keystone species. There is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to trophy hunt lions, rhino, leopards, and even giraffes. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by trophy hunting. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \\"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\\". Trends in Ecology and Evolution. Another tourism destination activity is scuba diving. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by recreational diving. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \\"na√Øve\\" divers who engage in underwater photography are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B. (2007). \\"Managing scuba divers to meet ecological goals for coral reef conservation\\". AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment, 36(4), 316‚Äì322.As the cost of underwater photography equipment has declined and its availability increased, it is inevitable that there will be an increase of direct damage to reefs by divers. Other direct impacts include over-fishing for \\"marine curios\\", sedimentation, and in-fill.Hawkins, J. P., & Roberts, C. M. (1994). \\"The growth of coastal tourism in the Red Sea: present and future effects on coral reefs\\". Ambio, 23(8), 503‚Äì508. There is also direct environmental impact due to disturbed and altered species behaviour from fish feeding, as well as import of invasive species and pollution caused by dive-boats. There are also indirect impacts such as shoreline construction of superstructure and infrastructure. = Transit effects = Since 2009 there has been a steady yearly increase in the number of tourist arrivals worldwide of approximately 4.4 percent. In 2015 there were 1.186 billion tourist arrivals worldwide, of which 54 percent arrived by air (640 million), 39 percent (462 million) by motor vehicle, 5 percent by water (59 million), and 2 percent by rail (23.7 million).World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Tourism Highlights , 2016 Edition [internet]. Retrieved 28 November 2016 A seven-hour flight on a Boeing 747 produces 220 tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of driving an average size family saloon car for a year, or the energy requirement of an average family home for nearly 17 years.You Sustain [internet] available from www.yousustain.com 2016. Retrieved 26 November 2016 With the ever-increasing number of tourist arrivals, there is an ever-increasing quantity of global greenhouse gasses (GHG) being produced by the tourism industry. In 2015 it is estimated that 5 percent of global GHG emissions was attributable to air travel alone.  Sociocultural impacts of tourism  An inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of authenticity, the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.(Fernandes)(Fagence, http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf) Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of social interactions that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture. =Commodification of culture= Commodification of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable. There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. Rural tourism is seen as a \\"cure\\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area. For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices. However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource. Researchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures. In addition, the \\"development cure\\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \\"drug addiction, crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a Consumer Culture. =Demonstration effect= The demonstration effect was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists. There are a number of social, economic and behavioral reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their social status. Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.  Criticisms of the demonstration effect  There are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in advertisements, magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture. In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \\"weak\\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \\"all cultures are in a continual process of change\\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive. = Community participation = Community participation refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits. Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members. By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process. =Acculturation= Acculturation is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed. Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \\"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\\". This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction. = Positive socio-cultural impacts= There are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use public services, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall aesthetics of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and recreational facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other. Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, local heritage sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and oral histories. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.Ryan, C. (2003). Recreational tourism: Demand and impacts (Vol. 11). Channel View Publications. = Negative sociocultural impacts = Cultural interactions can have negative effects.Long, V. H. (1999). \\"Techniques for socially sustainable tourism development: lessons from Mexico\\". Department of Geography Publication Series, University of Waterloo, 52, 193‚Äì212. In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income. In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal drug use, and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution may increase due to tourists looking for a \\"good time\\". Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents. Culture shock may impact both tourists and their hosts.  Economic impacts  Global tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5 trillion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.Turner, R. (2015). Travel and Tourism: Economic Impact 2015 World (pp. 1‚Äì20). London: WTO. The GDP increase comes from the over one billion international tourists worldwide, a number that has been growing by 5 percent annually since 2012.Muchapondwa, E., & Stage, J. (2013). \\"The economic impacts of tourism in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa: Is poverty subsiding?\\", Natural Resources Forum, 37(2), 80‚Äì89.Norjanah, Mohd B., Jaafar Mastura, and Mohamad Diana. (2014) \\"Perceptions of Local Communities on the Economic Impacts of Tourism Development in Langkawi, Malaysia\\". SHS Web of Conferences, vol. 12, 2014, p. 01100 Visits and boosts to GDP are expected to continue to rise in the near future as falling oil prices contribute to reduced living costs and increased available income for households, as well as reduced costs for air travel. Tourism can be divided into subcategories into which impacts fall: spending from visitors on tourism experiences like beach holidays and theme parks (domestic and international), spending on leisure items like bicycles, business spending, and capital investment.Zhang, J., Madsen, B., & Jensen- Butler, C. (2007). \\"Regional economic impacts of tourism: The case of Denmark\\". Regional Studies, 41(6), 839‚Äì854. The economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities. Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.Goeldner, C. R., & Ritchie, J. B. (2007). Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies. John Wiley & Sons. The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \\"residents and non- residents for business and leisure purposes\\". In contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local stakeholders all the same. Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres. Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014. Induced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D. (2016). \\"Tourism, ecotourism and protected areas\\". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M. Needham (eds.), Parks and protected areas in Canada: Planning and management (4th ed) (pp. 391 ‚Äì 425). Toronto: Oxford University Press For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination. That individual goes on to spend that dollar on lunch from a local vendor, and that vendor goes on to spend it locally.Wagner, J. E. (1997). \\"Estimating the economic impacts of tourism\\". Annals of Tourism Research, 24(3), 592‚Äì608. = Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism = There are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities. A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03 A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 26 September 2020 The tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, national parks, or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists. Whereas, heritage tourism focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.Pigram, J. J. (1993). \\"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\\". Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156‚Äì174. Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on. In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to. Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying. Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home. Negative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, resources become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.J.G Nelson, R. Butler, G. Wall. (1999). \\"Tourism and Sustainable Development; A Civic Approach\\". Heritage Resource Centre Joint Publication, Number 2. University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series, Number 52. University of Waterloo Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and regulations. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC). Additionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region. Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.Tyrrell, T. J., & Johnston, R. J. (2006). \\"The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue\\". Journal of Travel Research, 45(1), 3‚Äì7. Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending. = Employment = Employment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism. Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors. Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional superstructure and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.) =Tourism satellite account= The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like forestry or oil and gas Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer. Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad. The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons. Before TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools. Routledge. This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment. In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it: * provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment * is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism * is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission * is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development * provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments * provides information on tourism human resource characteristics Through collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap. Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \\"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\\". = Projections for 2020 = Predictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the world's economic system appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6 billion by the year 2020. Of those tourists, 1.18 billion are expected to be intra- regional, and 377 million to be long-haul. Of these travelers, arrivals in developing countries are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier Direct contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors. Employment is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015). Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).

It is a small shrub with its branches and leaves densely covered with hairs. The leaves are stalkless, egg-shaped and covered with yellowish hairs while the flowers are small, tube-shaped and white. Description Dasymalla terminalis is a rigid shrub which grows to a height of with its branches densely covered with short, ash-coloured hairs. The younger branches and leaves are covered with a more yellowish layer of hairs. The leaves are egg-shaped, long, wide, with those near the ends of the branches crowded together. The flowers are white and arranged in upper leaf axils in groups of up to three on a stalk long and covered with short hairs. The flowers are surrounded by leafy bracts and bracteoles which are covered with glandular hairs, especially on their edges. The five sepals are long, linear in shape with hairy margins and joined to form a short tube near the base. The five petals are joined to form a tube long and mostly glabrous except for a dense hairy ring inside the tube, below the stamens. There are five lobes on the end of the petal tube, the lower one elliptic to almost round in shape and slightly larger than the other four lobes. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir who gave it the name Pityrodia chorisepala and published the description in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. In 2011, Barry Conn, Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber resurrected the genus Dasymalla and transferred this species to it as Dasymalla chorisepala. The specific epithet (chorisepala) is derived from the derived from Greek words meaning \\"separate\\" and \\"sepalled\\". Distribution Dasymalla chorisepala occurs in isolated populations in Western Australia and in the Northern Territory near its border with Western Australia. In Western Australia it grows in red sand on dunes and spinifex plains in the Great Sandy Desert biogeographic region and in the Northern Territory south of Mongrel Downs and west of Sandy Blight Junction in the Tanami Desert biogeographic region. Conservation Dasymalla chorisepala is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

The Eastmoreland Historic District is a proposed historic district for National Register of Historic Places listing within Portland, Oregon's Eastmoreland neighborhood, in the United States. Description The historic district encompasses approximately 475 acres within southeast Portland's Eastmoreland neighborhood, and is generally bounded by Woodstock Boulevard on the north, Cesar Chavez Boulevard and 36th Avenue on the east, Berkeley Park and Crystal Springs Boulevard on the south, and 27th and 28th Avenues on the west. History The proposed historic district was nominated by the Eastmoreland Neighborhood Association in an attempt to reduce the number of home demolitions and renovations. The bid has been contentious, with opponents arguing that historic designation would prevent owners from being able to expand or update houses. In February 2017, the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission endorsed the association's nomination for historic status. One week later, the nine-person State Advisory Committee on Historic Preservation unanimously endorsed the proposal, putting the district on \\"clear path toward the register\\". Historic status may be blocked if dissenting residents submit enough notarized objections by July 1. As of February 17, 675 of the more than 1,000 required objections have been received. The National Park Service is scheduled to decide the district's fate on July 6. In April 2018, four separate home owners split their property ownership among hundreds of trusts; these \\"owners\\" filed more than 5,000 formal objections to the historic district proposal, possibly blocking the nomination using a technical tactic. 952 additional objections were submitted by owners not associated with the hundreds of trusts. According to The Oregonian, \\"Without the trusts, the number of objections appears to have fallen short of a majority\\". The neighborhood association's president described the maneuver as \\"undemocratic\\" and said, \\"If this was an election, it would be called voter fraud.\\" The Oregon State Historic Preservation Office said, \\"According to federal rules, if more than 50% of the owners in a district submit objections, the property cannot be listed.\\" File:Eastmoreland HD signage (2017) - 1.jpg File:Eastmoreland HD signage (2017) - 2.jpg File:Eastmoreland HD signage (2017) - 3.jpg File:Eastmoreland HD signage (2017) - 4.jpg File:Eastmoreland HD signage (2017) - 5.jpg References External links * Keep Eastmoreland Free Eastmoreland, Portland, Oregon Historic districts in Oregon ","title":"Eastmoreland Historic District"},{"id":"52466377","text":"Marnix Vincent (1936‚Äì2016) was a Belgian literary translator, primarily translating Dutch into French.

After Gray was eliminated during convention presidential balloting, Sharpe withdrew from the race. Political positions Sharpe supports reducing regulations such as occupational licensing as well as legalizing marijuana and decriminalizing other drugs. Sharpe has advocated for raising revenue for New York by selling naming rights to bridges and highways. =Abortion= Sharpe considers himself \\"pro-choice\\" as well as \\"anti-abortion\\". While running for Governor, he vowed to reduce the number of abortions in New York state by increasing availability of other options instead of establishing regulations on abortion. =Criminal justice= Sharpe favors marijuana legalization, calling for hemp and marijuana to be \\"regulated like onions\\". Sharpe has said he would pardon those convicted of victimless crimes or otherwise non-violent offenses. =Economy= Sharpe has supported deregulation to stimulate economic growth, ending the funding of enforcement of unnecessary regulations. In particular, Sharpe has cited occupational licensing as a hurdle to small business, describing mandatory licensing for jobs such as barbers and dog walkers as \\"barriers to entry and a tax on the poor.\\" Additionally, to reduce the state deficit, Sharpe has called for eliminating unfunded mandates. He has vowed to follow this reduction in state spending with a reduction in property taxes and the ultimate repeal of the New York state income tax. =Education= Sharpe has called for the decentralization of education in New York State and has proposed a \\"K-10\\" model, reducing the span of high school to ready students for the workforce and/or college. Sharpe has also rejected standardized testing until high school. He stated, \\"everyone should be able to opt out of testing at any time....it puts kids who have special needs at a huge disadvantage. Kids who do not test well are labeled as dumb.\\" Additionally, Sharpe stated he would refuse federal grants for education. He would also abolish the Board of Regents. =Gun laws= Sharpe vowed, if elected, to repeal the NY SAFE Act by 2020 and pardon those convicted under its provisions. Sharpe supports allowing school teachers and staff to carry firearms on school grounds, on a voluntary basis.

Most often, this term is used to describe the characterization of technical lignins by means of chemical or thermo-chemical analysis. Technical lignins are lignins isolated from various biomasses during various kinds of technical processes such as wood pulping. The most common technical lignins include lignosulphonates (isolated from sulfite pulping), kraft lignins (isolated from kraft pulping black liquor), organosolv lignins (isolated from organosolv pulping), soda lignins (isolated from soda pulping) and lignin residue after enzymatic treatment of biomass.  Important characteristics  Lignins can be characterized by determination of their purity, molecular structure and thermal properties. For certain applications, other properties such as electrical properties or color may be relevant to determine. =Purity =  Dry matter content  The dry matter content of lignins is the residue after drying at specified conditions. Any matter that is volatile at the drying conditions is not included in the dry matter content. The moisture content can be approximated by 100% minus the dry matter content. To determine the dry matter content, The sample is dried at a temperature of 105 ¬∞C ¬± 2 ¬∞C. The mass before and after the drying is determined gravimetrically. The dry matter content of sample is calculated as the ratio of mass after to the mass before the drying.  Lignin content  The lignin content can be defined as the sum of the amount of acid-insoluble matter and acid-soluble matter, absorbing at 205 nm, after sulphuric acid hydrolysis during specified conditions, as determined by gravimetry and spectrophotometry, in milligrams per gram. In the determination, the samples are hydrolyzed with sulphuric acid using a two-step technique. The amount of lignin is determined using gravimetry and spectrophotometry.  Carbohydrate content  The carbohydrate content can be defined as the sum of the amounts of the five principal, neutral wood monosaccharides; arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose and xylose in anhydrous form, in a sample, in milligrams per gram. In the determination, the samples are hydrolyzed with sulphuric acid using a two- step technique. The amounts of the different monosaccharides are determined using ion chromatography (IC).  Ash content  The ash content can be defined as the gravimetrically determined residue after ignition at a defined temperature, in a sample, in percent (weight / weight dry matter of sample). In the determination, a sample is weighed in a heat-resistant crucible, dried at 105¬±2 ¬∞C, and ignited in a muffle furnace at 525¬±25 ¬∞C. The ash content is then determined, on a moisture-free basis, from the weight of residue after ignition and the moisture content of the sample.  Metal/elements content  The metal elements content (including sulphur) may be determined as the sum of the elements Al, Ba, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P, Si, S and Zn after oxidation and acid digestion. The metal elements can be determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) after wet digestion. In such a determination, the samples are oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and subsequently acid digested in a closed vessel using a microwave acid digestion apparatus. After cooling, the samples are diluted and the concentration of each element determined by the ICP-OES.  Extractives content  The extractives content can be defined as the sum of matter that can be extracted by petroleum ether, and that does not evaporate during drying. This material consists mainly of fatty acids, resin acids, fatty alcohols, sterols, glycerides and steryl esters. In the determination, the samples are extracted with petroleum ether in a for instance a Soxtec apparatus. After extraction, the solvents are evaporated and the residue is dried Note that petroleum ether extracts may also contain elemental sulphur, S8, if present in the lignin sample. If the dried extracts contain a yellowish precipitate, this indicates that sulphur is present. =Molecular structure =  Hydroxyl groups  The main hydroxyl groups in lignin are aliphatic (R‚ÄìOH), phenolic (Ph‚ÄìOH) and carboxylic acid (R‚ÄìCOOH) hydroxyl groups. Phenolic hydroxyl groups are syringyl (S), guaiacyl (G) and p-hydroxyphenyl (H) structures and C5-substituted (i.e. having Œ≤-5, 4-O-5 and 5-5 inter-unit linkages) structures. The hydroxyl groups may be determined by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In such a determination, the lignin sample is dissolved using a mixture of DMF and pyridine (in excess for a quantitative reaction), in the presence of an internal standard (IS) and a relaxation reagent (RR), and then phosphitylated using a mixture of a derivatisation regent (DR) and deuterated chloroform. The phosphitylated sample is then scanned using liquide state 31P-NMR spectroscopy and the hydroxyl groups are quantified by integration of the corresponding signals from obtained 31P-NMR spectra.  Structural elements  Structural elements in lignins are the building blocks in the macromolecule corresponding to the monomers and the intra-molecular bonds. For lignins, the structural elements are often determined by pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (py-GC-MS or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).  Molar mass distribution  The molar mass distribution of lignin describe the relationship between the number of moles of each lignin molecule species and the molar mass of that species. Different average values can be defined, depending on the statistical method applied. For lignins, weight-average molar mass (Mw) and number-average molar mass (Mn) are often determined. In addition, the peak molar mass (Mp) is often determined. For kraft lignins, the molar mass distribution can be determined by aqueous phase or organic phase size-exclusion chromatography. = Thermal properties =  Glass transition temperature  The glass transition temperature (Tg) can be defined by the temperature at which an amorphous polymeric material undergoes a reversible transition from a hard, solid state to a more rubbery state, as determined as inflection point of the heat capacity-temperature curve recorded by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In the determination, the samples are often dried at 105 ¬∞C and subsequently analyzed by DSC in a hermetic aluminum pan by increasing the temperature above the Tg, and recording the heat capacity-temperature curve. = Electric properties = Carbonized lignin can be used in electrical applications such as batteries and supercapacitors. The electrical properties of carbonized lignin can be assessed with techniques such as two-and four- point method, impedance spectroscopy, galvanostatic charge-discharge and cyclic voltammetry.

Biography  His father was a clerk for the city government. He received his first drawing lessons from .Brief biography @ Landschaftsverband Rheinland. By the time of Zick's death, Saal was proficient enough to work on the reconstruction project at the ruins of Stolzenfels Castle. From 1842 to 1846, he attended the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf, where he studied landscape painting with Johann Wilhelm Schirmer and architecture with Rudolf Wiegmann. Family of Bears in a Mountain Landscape This was followed by travels to the Eifel mountains, the Lahn River and the Black Forest. His friend from the Akademie, Hans Gude, aroused his interest in Norway, so he spent several months there travelling with August Leu and August Becker. When he returned, the paintings he had created impressed Wilhelm von Schadow, who took him into his Master Class. In 1848, he moved to Heidelberg. He returned to Norway in 1850, visited Switzerland in 1852 and, in 1853, Bavaria. Although he created works that were described as scenes of Greenland, it seems unlikely that he actually went there. Following his marriage in 1853, he relocated to Baden-Baden, where he had been named court painter to Grand Duke Louis II. He remained there for the rest of his life, although he also maintained a residence in Paris after 1857 and became involved with the Barbizon school. In 1864, he made an extended trip to Savoy and England. In 1869, he suffered a stroke, but recovered. The following year, at the beginning of the Siege of Paris, he rushed home and died of a second stroke shortly after arriving.

Isolated from acidic hydrothermal vent environments, A. boonei is the first cultured representative of a biogeochemically significant clade of thermoacidophilic archaea known as the ‚ÄúDeep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Euryarchaeota 2 (DHVE2)‚Äù. Cell morphology and physiology A. boonei is an obligate thermoacidophile capable of growing at pH 3.3-5.8, with its optimum zone being 4.2-4.8. Cultures have been shown to grow between 55-77 ¬∞C with best growth occurring at 70 ¬∞C with a 2.5-3.5% (w/v) NaCl optimum.Reysenbach AL, Liu Y, Banta A, Beveridge T, Kirshtein J, Schouten S, Tivey M, Von Damm K, Voytek M 2006. A ubiquitous thermoacidophilic archaeon from deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Nature. 442:444-447 Morphologically, the archaeon has been described as a pleiomorphic cocci with a diameter of 0.6-1.0Œºm, that is motile via a singular, proximally sheathed flagellum. A. boonei cells are enveloped by a plasma membrane and a single S-layer, which is structurally comparable to that of Picrophilus oshimae. Despite the common belief that S-layers are quasi-crystalline, the S-layer of ‚Äò‚ÄôA. boonei‚Äô‚Äô demonstrates visible plasticity and is capable of bending into small, highly curved structures resembling vesicles.Reysenbach AL, Flores G. 2008. Electron microscopy encounters with unusual thermoacidophiles helps direct genomic analysis of Aciduliprofundum boonei. Geobiol. ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äô6‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô:331-336 Budding from the cell, these spherical components can segregate small quantities of cytoplasm and travel extracellularly until they combine with neighboring cells. Other visual observations, through transmission electron microscopy, of A. boonei have depicted these vesicles as budding off the cell in chains. In other bacteria and archaea vesicles such as these are produced to remove misfolded proteins or toxins during periods of stress, to shuttle mRNA, cell-cell communication, and to deliver virulence factors. The biogeochemical significance of the energy demanding process of budding has yet to be identified in this species. Further chemical analyses have shown its membrane lipids are primarily composed of glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers with 0-4 cyclopentane rings. This biochemical structure is likely a hallmark trait of acidophilic Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota, and have been detected in Ferroplasma and Thermoplasma, which are the closest cultured relatives of A. boonei. Environment and ecology Identification of the thermoacidophilic archaeon has been restricted to deep-sea hydrothermal vents that populate benthic environments. More specifically, A. boonei is found in samples collected from the horizontal flanges of chimneys that protrude from the ocean floor. It is believed that conductive cooling and diffusion of end member fluids creates the perfect microniche for optimum survival of the organism in such a harsh environment. These environments are extremely limiting as far as life is concerned, and demands unique metabolisms and behavior. Hydrothermal vents are characteristically hot, oxygen limited, toxic, and reduced, therefore limiting colonization to organisms that are capable of surviving under such harsh conditions. Consequently, organisms found in this environment are typically extremophiles such as thermophiles, acidophiles, halophiles, and barophiles/piezophiles. The unique hydrothermal environment is rich in sulfur- and iron-based metabolites that are used by a variety of lithotrophic organisms as electron donors and acceptors. As a result, the local environment allows for a broad spectrum of metabolic processes that are dependent on thermal and chemical gradients. Metabolism As an obligate anaerobe, A. boonei requires restrictive anoxic reduced niches to survive. It benefits from a continuous supply of inorganic electron acceptors such as elemental sulfur, sulfate, and ferric iron. Conditions such as these are naturally formed in the vent system by geophysical and geochemical processes that occur beneath the crust and within the benthic fluids that flood the vents. The archaeon is shown to be an obligate heterotroph that primarily ferments peptides to harness energy. Genomic studies have revealed the presence of multiple proteolytic and peptidolytic enzymes that participate in peptide metabolism. Additionally, genome reconstruction revealed a complete but modified Embden-Meyerof-Parnas pathway that operates in the gluconeogenic direction. As a strict chemoheterotroph, A. boonei requires a continuous supply of peptides to carry out its cellular processes. Culture-based studies have shown the archaeon to only grow on trypticase peptone, casein, and yeast extract. Growth on these complex organics has revealed the production of small organic acids such as formate and acetate. To obtain the necessary exogenous peptides, A. boonei has been shown to have a membrane embedded with peptidases and an arsenal of permeases which help degrade the extracellular components and subsequently transport them into the cell for utilization. Additionally, the cytoplasm is flooded with peptidases that continue the peptide metabolism. Genome analysis shows that the archaeon is auxotrophic for many amino acids, which is evidenced by incomplete biosynthetic pathways in its reconstructed genome. Therefore, some peptides and amino acids would be entering the cell to be used for energy, while others will be incorporated into cellular machinery. Based on ecological studies of deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems, it is believed that the anoxic reduced environments in which A. boonei thrives, are shaped, in part, by the synergistic associations the organism has with other members of its hydrothermal vent community. Genomic studies have revealed that the members of the DHVE2 clade, which includes A. boonei, co-occur (spatially) with other thermoacidophilic archaea that utilize different carbon and/or energy sources.Flores G, Wagner I, Liu Y, Reysenbach AL. 2012. Distribution, abundance, and diversity patterns of the thermoacidophilc \\"deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeota 2\\" Fron Microbiol. 3:1-17 Genome Difficulties physically culturing A. boonei led to a plethora of genomic investigations to understand the organism and other members of its clade. Quantitative PCR was used to detect archaeal sequences in deep-sea vent samples globally.Takai K, Horikosh K. 1999. Genetic Diversity of Archaea in Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Environments. Genetics. 152:1285-1297 Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene allowed for phylogenetic reconstruction of the DHVE2 and other deep branching thermophilic archaea often found in the hydrothermal environment. Phylogenetic trees were constructed to visually demonstrate the novelty of the DHVE2 group as well as A. boonei. A draft genome of A. boonei strain T469 resulted in 31 scaffolds averaging approximately 47kbp (kilo- basepairs) in size, with a G+C% content of 39%. The reconstruction pieced together a map of genes involved in flagella formation, and show that the organism's novel organization resembles both prevailing architectures of flagellar genes in archaea; fla1 and fla2. The novel third pattern of flagellar organization is somewhat of a hybrid of fla1 and fla2 but without a few crucial components. This suggests that both reductive evolution and horizontal gene transfer may have played a role in the acquisition of the flagella genes. Discovery and isolation The archaeon was first isolated in sulfide samples collected on diving expeditions at the Eastern Lau Spreading Center, as part of a research project directed by Anna-Louis Reysenbach in 2006. Despite prior difficulty isolating members from the DHVE2 class of archaea from these hydrothermal vent environments, it was ultimately isolated on ocean media under anaerobic and acidic conditions that prevented the growth of Thermoplasma volcanium which often outcompetes A. boonei. The organism was later isolated in samples from the East Pacific Rise and Mid-Atlantic Ridge. =Etymology= Aciduliprofundum is derived from the acidulous (Latin), a little sour; and profundum (Latin), deep, for its acidophilic nature and benthic localization respectively. Boonei (Latin), of Boone, is in reference to David Boone who made significant contributions to the study of archaeal diversity.

She originally worked in the field of Information Technology (IT) and progressed to the position of National Director of IT for Ernst & Young Australia based in Sydney. Zimbabwe-focused work Pincott worked alone, on a full-time voluntary basis, for 13 years (2001-2014) with the clan of wild, free-roaming, elephants known as the Presidential Elephants of Zimbabwe on land bordering the Main Camp entrance to Hwange National Park. She acquired a reputation for being able to \\"talk to the elephants\\".

Sharon Pincott in Hwange (2009) From December 2017 Pincott was active in voicing widespread opposition to scores more young elephants being captured, forcibly taken from their mothers and families inside Hwange National Park and transported to Chinese zoos, appealing to Zimbabwe's new President Emmerson Mnangagwa for an immediate review of policy and ultimately delivering a petition that attracted 287,509 signatures.

On International Women's Day 2017 Pincott was acknowledged by associates of the Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland, Australia, as \\"blazing a trail for elephants as well as women working in conservation\\". In late March 2017, almost 3 years after leaving her Hwange elephant work, Pincott was still being acknowledged by the Zimbabwe press for her \\"profound dedication to the Presidential Elephants\\", in a country increasingly known for hostility towards conservationists who speak out against wildlife-related corruption. In May 2017, after a male big-game hunter was crushed to death in Hwange when an adult female elephant, felled by gunfire, landed on him, Pincott reasoned in an interview that it was \\"likely\\" to be a known Presidential Elephant female that was shot in this hunting party incident, and highlighted the ongoing ineffectuality of Mugabe's Presidential Decree.

Biography =Early life and career= Orlando Lorenzini was born in Guardistallo, Pisa province, son of Giuseppe Lorenzini and Maria Giuntini. He entered the S. Quirico Salesian Boarding School in Collesalvetti in 1895, and later attended the Volterra Seminary High School and the Galileo Galilei High School in Pisa, where he graduated. He began his military career on 20 May 1910, when he was drafted as a private in the 84th Infantry Regiment; he fought in the Italo-Turkish War and became an officer on 4 February 1912. During World War I, Lorenzini fought with the rank of Captain on the Italian front, where he commanded the 2099th Machine-gun Company of the \\"Udine\\" Brigade in the Montello sector. He received a Silver Medal of Military Valor for an action on 18 June 1918, on Montello, during the Second Battle of the Piave River; he also received a War Merit Cross in 1919. In the 1920s, Lorenzini fought for several years in Cyrenaica and Fezzan during the campaign for the pacification of Libya. He was mentioned in despatches in July 1924 for inflicting a defeat on the Senussi rebels in the Jebel Auaghir area, in command of a squadron of armed vehicles; in 1925 he was made a Knight of the Colonial Order of the Star of Italy, and in 1926 he received another War Merit Cross and was promoted to Major following a 20-month campaign in the Central Jebel. In the summer of 1927, Lorenzini commanded an armoured car squadron during a successful campaign in the Cyrenaic Jebel, where he pursued and destroyed a group of Libyan rebels in August 1927; in March 1928, he was made a Knight of the Military Order of Savoy for this action and was again mentioned in despatches by the Governor of Cyrenaica. Between January and February 1928, his armoured car squadron fought the rebels between Gifa and Jalo, which led a second Silver Medal of Military Valor being awarded to him in May 1929. =East Africa= In December 1931 Lorenzini was made an Officer of the Colonial Order of the Star of Italy, and in June 1933 he was made Commander of the same order. In September 1933 he received another War Merit Cross. In 1935 Lorenzini, by then commander of the 14th Eritrean Battalion, was sent on a secret mission to contact the Danakil people with the aim of making an alliance with them in the imminent Second Italo-Ethiopian War. He then fought in the war as commander of the 14th and 22nd Eritrean Battalion; on 15 October 1936 he was awarded a Bronze Medal of Military Valor for a successful action against Ethiopian troops. After the Italian victory and the annexation of Ethiopia to Italian East Africa, Lorenzini remained in East Africa, commanding the 11th Colonial Brigade and the 2nd Colonial Brigade, fighting against Ethiopian guerrillas. In June 1937 he led a colonial brigade in a successful three-day battle against the guerrillas in Shewa, which earned him another Silver Medal of Military Valor. In the same year he was made Knight of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus and in the following year also Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy, in addition to receiving a further War Merit Cross. Between April and July 1938, Lorenzini led his colonial brigade in fierce fighting against the Arbegnoch fighters in the Goggiam region, obtaining a victory and his fourth Silver Medal of Military Valor. In 1939 Lorenzini was promoted to colonel for merit of war, following long campaigns in East Africa, and was awarded another War Merit Cross. Between August 1938 and May 1940, Lorenzini overall fought in six campaign of counterguerrilla operations in Shewa. For the successes in these campaigns, he would receive a fifth Silver Medal of Military Valor in February 1941. =World War II= Tomb in Keren cemetery When World War II broke out, Lorenzini was in command of the 2nd Colonial Brigade in Italian East Africa. In August 1940 he took part in the Italian conquest of British Somaliland, after which he was promoted for war merit to the rank of Brigadier-General. When the British Commonwealth launched its counteroffensive from Sudan, in early 1941, Lorenzini and his brigade were transferred to Keren, Eritrea, to defend Italian Eritrea. The Duke of Aosta, Viceroy of Italian East Africa, appointed Lorenzini commander of the 4th Colonial Division, and tasked him with halting the British advance against Agordat. Lorenzini tried to strengthen the defences of Agordat; the battle began on 26 January 1941, and on 31 January, after suffering heavy losses, Lorenzini's men were forced to abandon the town; they slowed down the British advance by blowing up bridges and laying mines behind them, but they were forced to abandon all vehicles, tanks and guns when the normal road turned into a mule track. Lorenzini took command again of the 2nd Colonial Brigade and retreated to Keren, where the final battle for Eritrea would take place. The Battle of Keren lasted from 5 February to 1 April 1941, and was the longest and the bloodiest of the East African Campaign. General Lorenzini was killed during the battle at 15:00 on 17 March 1941, by a grenade splinter. He was buried in the Asmara War Cemetery two days later, and posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.Lorenzini Orlando His abilities won the posthumous respect of his enemies; in the official Indian military history of the campaign in East Africa, Compton Mackenzie referred to Lorenzini as gallant and praised his leadership of colonial troops in the first days of the battle of Keren.Compton Mackenzie, Eastern Epic: September 1939 - March 1943 Defence, p. 64 Chatto & Windus, 1951 Notes  Sources  * Gian Carlo Stella, Paola Lorenzini Doveri Trent'anni d'Affrica.

Monem Mahjoub A. Monem Mahjoub (born May 4, 1963) is a Libyan linguist, philosopher, poet, historian, and political critic. Sometimes described as \\"the last Sumerian\\",Walid Zribi, ed. (2016) Back to Sumer, Arabesques Books, Tunisia. p.25. his major works are in the fields of linguistics, philology, historiography, religion and humanistic thought, civilization development and politics. As a prolific author he has written more than twenty-five books. Mahjoub was born in the Libyan town of Sorman, located east of the archaeological site of the city of Sabratha.Walid Zribi (2009). The Last Sumerian. TCP, Tunisia. p. 10. As a youngster he was attracted by the residual remnants of the Roman and Phoenician civilizations. During this period he documented those monuments in a large photo collection. Having completed his primary education, he moved to study Industrial Management at George Brown College in Toronto, Canada where he studied for two years. He received a Master of Philosophy degree at Hassan University in Morocco. His Ph.D thesis, \\"Culture and Communication Arts Theory\\", was completed in 1999. Theory of Sumerian roots Mahjoub argues that he continues to amend an academic perception in the fields of linguistics that has lasted since the late nineteenth-century, related to the Sumerian language, which originated on the shores of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in southern Mesopotamia in the 4th millennium B.C. Mahjoub dismisses the idea that Sumerian was an isolated language and that its influence did not extend to the formulation of the world, especially Afroasiatic languages. He published his work Pre-language, Sumerian roots of Arabic and AfroAsiatic languages, presenting Afroasiology as a new coded term in the field of historical linguistics, claiming that Sumerian is the embryonic stage of the Afroasiatic languages, including Arabic. Afroasiatic progression Mahjoub has endeavoured, through books published later, to support the theoretical hypothesis demonstrated in his Pre-language. He tracked and memorized phonetic changes that overlapped the Afroasiatic languages, by comparing Sumerian, Akkadian, Arabic and ancient Egyptian. He concluded that the Sumerian and Akkadian superposition is more than borrowed vocabulary, popularized as a result of the representation of the two languages in the same cuneiform writing, but that the Sumerian syllables are an embedded substratum in Akkadian and Arabic. He has also concluded that there are Afroasiatic arrays descended from the Sumerian, and that the Sumerian single and dual syllables are inherent in Akkadian, Arabic, Egyptian and other Afroasiatic languages and spoken dialects. Related to this hypothesis, Mahjoub updated the primeval Arabic language's beginnings from the fourth millennium BC, i.e. since the cuneiform writing appeared to codify the Sumerian language. Further to that, the historical origins of the Arabs themselves must start from 12 thousand years, since the emergence of the vanguard of the Sumerians in Mesopotamia following the last ice age regression. These results reflected his writings on philosophical propositions by stating that the Sumerian epics produced Chaldean wisdom that produced the concept of the logos. This would later be structurized in Greece and turned into an abstract mind out of history mobility with western philosophers.A. Monem Mahjoub (2004). The Heirs of Logos, World Center for Studies and Research, Tripoli, Libya. Mahjoub's position on Islam Mahjoub believes that the current Islam is a new phase of a religion that has been changing since the third century AH (ninth century AD), and it has been remade in the twentieth century out of a confused mixture of clerical ideas by contemporary clergy, and that the multilayered understanding of Islam is reshaped to comply with ancient tribal traditions which are still powerful in the modern era, due to the control of the Muslim clerics who aspire to establish a theological authority in the Arab countries under the name of Islam. Thinking of faith as an individual matter, he considers freedom of belief to be the most necessary need in Islamic societies. The cover of Mahjoub's manifesto against the Islamic priesthood He published his Manifesto Against the Islamic Priesthood in Tunis, calling to liberate faith from the control of Islamic clergy and to rescue civil life from religious intervention. He wrote ironically to clerics, \\"Unchain faith, thus it can leave the muddy body and rise to sky\\", but in direct words, \\"Lock up Islam in mosques, Christianity in churches, and Judaism in Synagogues. Religion is an indoor activity. It's of temples not of streets.\\"A. M. Mahjoub (2016). Manifesto against the Islamic Priesthood. Tanit Books, p.58. Activities Mahjoub's career and cultural participation began in the 1980s, with intellectual and literary contributions to events held by Libyan and Arab world institutions and scientific centers, such as the Academy of Jamahiry Thought in Tripoli, Alfateh University, the Institute of Graduate Studies and the Union of Writers. * Founder of Al-Jadeed (The new) newspaper, Tripoli, 1986/1988. * Founder of the monthly Fadaat (spaces) for thought, culture and criticism, sponsored by the World Center for Studies and Researches.

Biography Erwin Reifler was born on June 16, 1903 in Vienna, Austria to a Jewish family. He studied political science, Chinese (with Arthur von Rosthorn), and European classical languages at the University of Vienna. There he was a librarian in the Chinese Library in the Imperial Palace in Vienna from 1924 to 1927. He was awarded a PhD in political science in 1931. His thesis was entitled State and Administration in Ancient China. At Vienna he also developed a friendship with the American actress Anna May Wong who encouraged him to go to China. He went to China in 1932 as an assistant and interpreter for the Austrian consulate to Shanghai and got the position to teach German at Shanghai Jiaotong University. He had the professorship in German language for five years and mainly taught German to Chinese but also Chinese to international foreigners in Shanghai. His wife Henrietta Brown was a student of his at that time. During his early pedagogical career, he developed a set of mnemonic schemes for learning Chinese characters. This study led him to further develop an interest in comparative semantics and semasiology. He taught shortly from 1937 and 1940 in Hongkong before he went back to Shanghai and taught philology (German and Latin) in the National Medical College and in the School of Pharmacy of the Sino-French University. He settled later into the position of Professor of Sinology at l'Universit√© l'Aurore (ÈúáÊó¶Â§ßÂ≠¶). In 1947, he met Karl August Wittfogel in US and the latter recommended Reifler to George Taylor who was then starting the Far Eastern Department at the University of Washington. Reifler join the faculty in the fall of 1947 and taught there until his death in 1965. Involvement in Machine Translation In 1948, Erwin Reifler presented a paper entitled \\"the Chinese Language in the Light of Comparative Semantics\\" at the American Philosophical Society annual conference. The abstract of the paper was published by Science in the same year. Warren Weaver, the Director of Natural Sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation, at that time saw the paper, and cited an example Reifler gave in order to illustrate the potential connections across languages in Weaver own memorandum on the possibility Machine Translation in 1949.

Currently, many sanctions are concerned with North Korea's nuclear weapons program and were imposed after its first nuclear test in 2006. The United States imposed sanctions in the 1950s and tightened them further after international bombings against South Korea by North Korean agents during the 1980s, including the Rangoon bombing and the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858. In 1988, the United States added North Korea to its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Sanctions against North Korea started to ease during the 1990s when South Korea's then-liberal government pushed for engagement policies with the North. The Clinton administration signed the Agreed Framework with North Korea in 1994. However, the relaxing of economic sanctions was short-lived. North Korea continued its nuclear program and officially withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003, causing countries to reinstate various sanctions. UN Security Council Resolutions were passed after North Korea conducted nuclear tests in 2006, 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2017. Initially, sanctions were focused on trade bans on weapons-related materials and goods but expanded to luxury goods to target the elites. Further sanctions expanded to cover financial assets, banking transactions, and general travel and trade. Supranational bodies =European Union= The European Union has imposed a series of sanctions against North Korea since 2006. These include: * embargoing arms and related materials. * banning the export of aviation and rocket fuel to North Korea. * banning the trade of gold, precious metals, and diamonds with the North Korean government. * banning the import of minerals from North Korea, with some exemptions for coal and iron ore. * banning the export of luxury goods. * restricting financial support for trade with North Korea. * restricting investment and financial activities. * inspecting and monitoring cargoes imported to and exported from North Korea. * prohibiting certain North Korean individuals from entering the EU. On 21 September 2017, EU banned oil exports and investments in North Korea. =United Nations Security Council= A North Korea cargo ship at the dock in Nampo The UN Security Council has passed a number of resolutions since North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. * Resolution 1718, passed in 2006, demanded that North Korea cease nuclear testing and prohibited the export of some military supplies and luxury goods to North Korea. The UN Security Council Sanctions Committee on North Korea was established, supported by the Panel of Experts. * Resolution 1874, passed after the second nuclear test in 2009, broadened the arms embargo. Member states were encouraged to inspect ships and destroy any cargo suspected of being related to the nuclear weapons program. * Resolution 2087, passed in January 2013 after a satellite launch, strengthened previous sanctions by clarifying a state's right to seize and destroy cargo suspected of heading to or from North Korea for purposes of military research and development. * Resolution 2094, passed in March 2013 after the third nuclear test, imposed sanctions on money transfers and aimed to shut North Korea out of the international financial system. * Resolution 2270, passed in March 2016 after the fourth nuclear test, further strengthened existing sanctions. It banned the export of gold, vanadium, titanium, and rare earth metals. The export of coal and iron were also banned, with an exemption for transactions that were purely for \\"livelihood purposes.\\" * Resolution 2321, passed in November 2016, capped North Korea's coal exports and banned exports of copper, nickel, zinc, and silver. In February 2017, a UN panel said that 116 of 193 member states had not yet submitted a report on their implementation of these sanctions, though China had. * Resolution 2371, passed in August 2017, banned all exports of coal, iron, lead, and seafood. The resolution also imposed new restrictions on North Korea's Foreign Trade Bank and prohibited any increase in the number of North Koreans working in foreign countries. * Resolution 2375, passed on 11 September 2017, limited North Korean crude oil and refined petroleum product imports; banned joint ventures, textile exports, natural gas condensate and liquid imports; and banned North Korean nationals from working abroad in other countries. * Resolution 2397, passed on 22 December 2017 after the launch of a Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, limited North Korean crude oil and refined petroleum product imports to 500,000 barrels per year, banned the export of food, machinery and electrical equipment, called for the repatriation of all North Korean nationals earning income abroad within 24 months. The resolution also authorized member states to seize and inspect any vessel in their territorial waters found to be illicitly providing oil or other prohibited products to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. United Nations agencies are restricted in the aid they can give to North Korea because of the sanctions, but they can help with nutrition, health, water, and sanitation. Nations =Australia= Australia has imposed a series of sanctions against North Korea since August 2017. =China= In February 2017, China banned all imports of coal from North Korea for the rest of the year. China also banned exports of some petroleum products and imports of textiles from North Korea in line with United Nations resolutions. =Japan= In 2016, Japan imposed sanctions against North Korea including: *banning remittances, except those made for humanitarian purposes less than in value. *prohibiting North Korean citizens from entering Japan. *renewing the ban on North Korean ships entering Japanese ports and extending it to include other ships that have visited North Korea. *banning nuclear and missile technicians who have been to North Korea from entering Japan. =Russia= On 30 March 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree implementing intensified United Nations Security Council sanctions against Pyongyang's nuclear programs. The presidential decree banned the purchase of weapons and relevant materials from the DPRK by government offices, enterprises, banks, organizations and individuals currently under Russia's jurisdiction. It also prohibited the transit of weapons and relevant materials via Russian territory or their export to the DPRK. Any financial aid and educational training that might facilitate North Korea's nuclear program and proliferation activities were also forbidden.Asia Times, Russia and the North Korean Knot. In December 2013 Russia joined the sanctions against North Korea, introduced in March by the UN Security Council (Resolution 2087). The corresponding decree signed by President Putin specified that Russian companies were prohibited to provide North Korea any technical assistance and advice in the development and production of ballistic missiles. In addition, North Korean naval vessels to call at Russian ports would be required to undergo inspection. Also, the authorities ordered to be vigilant when dealing with North Korean diplomats. In October 2017 Russian President Vladimir Putin signed Presidential decree (ukaz) No. 484 \\"On measures to implement UN Security Council resolution 2321 of November 30, 2016\\" imposing sanctions on North Korea in connection with the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2321 of November 30, 2016. The decree supplements a number of applications, including a list of individuals and legal entities associated with the North Korean nuclear program or its ballistic missile program, which are subject to restrictions. The measures provided for by Security Council resolution 2321 introduce additional bans on trade, economic, banking, financial, scientific and technical cooperation with the North Korea. In the trade and economic field, the purchase of copper, nickel, silver and zinc from the North Korea is prohibited. At the same time, the exception provided for by UN Security Council resolution 2270 of March 2, 2016 is retained for the project for the transit of Russian coal through Russian Railways through the North Korean port of Rajin for subsequent export to third countries. In addition, scientific and technical cooperation with the participation of persons or groups representing North Korea should be suspended, with the exception of exchanges in the field of medicine. In addition, targeted restrictions are expanding on a number of North Korean individuals and legal entities, as well as lists of products, including \\"luxury goods\\", the import and export of which is prohibited to and from North Korea. In addition, expanding the list of dual-use goods and other items whose import into the DPRK is prohibited due to their potential use for nuclear missile program of the country and other actions that violate the North Korean sanctions regime. The document also provides for a complete ban on the import of textile products from North Korea. Additional restrictions on cooperation in the transport sector were introduced in the decree: the delivery of new helicopters and ships to North Korea became prohibited; all seagoing ships owned or controlled by the North Korea should be removed from state registration; North Korean aircraft and ship inspection measures were tightened on the territory of UN member states. =South Korea = In 2010, South Korea imposed sanctions against North Korea in response to the sinking of the South Korean naval ship, the ROKS Cheonan, known as the May 24 measures. These sanctions included: *banning North Korean ships from South Korean territorial waters. *suspending inter-Korean trade except at the Kaesong Industrial Zone. *banning most cultural exchanges. In 2016, President Park Geun-hye ordered the Kaesong Industrial Region to close in retaliation for the nuclear test in January and the rocket launch in February. In 2019, U.N. panel accused South Korea of violating sanctions by not notifying the Security Council about its deliveries of petroleum products for use at inter- Korean joint liaison office. Also in the Annex of the Updated Guidance on Addressing North Korea‚Äôs Illicit Shipping Practices, issued from United States Department of the Treasury, a ship of South Korea was listed as that believed to have engaged in ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean tankers. =Taiwan= In 2017 Taiwan also banned trade with North Korea to comply with the United Nations resolutions, despite not being a member of the UN. North Korea is Taiwan's 174th largest trading partner and imported US$1.2 million and exported US$36,575 in goods from January to July 2017. A year later, former High Court judge Chiang Kuo-hua and his son, Chiang Heng had allegedly evaded North Korean sanctions by chartering a ship to transport four anthracite coals from Vietnam that summer. Both of them and two other PRC nationals were accused of assisting terrorists and forging documents. =United States= From 1950 to 2008, trade between the United States and North Korea was restricted under the US Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. After 2008, some restrictions related to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act stayed in effect. In February 2016, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 () was passed which: *requires the President to sanction entities found to have contributed to North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, arms trade, human rights abuses, or other illegal activities. *imposes mandatory sanctions on entities involved in North Korea's mineral or metal trade, which comprises a large part of North Korea's foreign exports. *requires the US Treasury Department to determine whether North Korea should be listed as a \\"primary money laundering concern,\\" which would trigger tough new financial restrictions. *imposes new sanctions authorities related to North Korean human rights and cybersecurity abuse. In July 2017, after the death of tourist Otto Warmbier, the United States government banned US citizens from visiting North Korea without special validation starting 1 September 2017. In August 2017, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act was passed. On 21 September 2017, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 13810 allowing the United States to cut from its financial system or freeze assets of any companies, businesses, organizations, and individuals trading in goods, services, or technology with North Korea. Also any aircraft or ship upon entering North Korea is banned for 180 days from entering the United States. The same restriction applies to ships which conduct ship-to-ship transfers with North Korean ships. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin stated that \\"Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or North Korea, but not both.\\" A statement from the White House said \\"Foreign financial institutions must choose between doing business with the United States or facilitating trade with North Korea or its designated supporters.\\" On 25 September 2017, the US Treasury barred the entry of North Korean nationals to the United States. Following the abduction of a South Korean fishing vessel, additional sanctions were ordered by the US Treasury on 26 October 2017, following a culmination of \\"flagrant\\" rights abuses including executions, torture, and forced labour. Seven individuals and three North Korean entities were affected by the sanctions. On 11 July 2018, during a summit in Brussels, NATO leaders called for continued pressure and ongoing sanctions enforcement on North Korea. The group of 29 countries, including the United States, signed a declaration which called on members to maintain pressure on North Korea though also welcomed recent diplomatic progress in the region.https://www.nknews.org/2018/07/nato-calls-for-continued-sanctions- pressure-on-north-korea/ On 13 November 2018, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Prime Minister Shinz≈ç Abe reaffirmed the need to keep sanctions on North Korea to achieve its denuclearization.https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/pence-abe-agree-on-n- korea-sanction-indo-pacific-projects-1.556428 On 20 December 2018, it was reported that the United States plans to review its ban on US travel to North Korea.US to reconsider travel ban to North Korea U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed sanctions against North Korea imposed by China and Russia.  Evasion of sanctions  According to the United Nations Panel of Experts in April 2019, North Korea had developed a number of techniques and a complex web of organizations to enable it to evade the sanctions. The techniques included falsification of documents and covert ship-to-ship transfers of cargo at sea. In May 2019, the United States announced it had seized a North Korean cargo vessel for carrying a coal shipment in defiance of sanctions. The Justice Department said the 17,061-tonne Wise Honest is one of the North's largest cargo ships and she was first detained by Indonesia in April 2018 but she was now in the possession of the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump accused China and Russia of violating sanctions against North Korea. Assessment A report by the United Nations Panel of Experts stated that North Korea was covertly trading in arms and minerals despite sanctions against this. The academic John Delury has described the sanctions as futile and counterproductive. He has argued that they are unenforceable and unlikely to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons program. On the other hand, Sung-Yoon Lee, Professor in Korean Studies at the Fletcher School, and Joshua Stanton advocate continued tightening of sanctions and targeting Pyongyang's systemic vulnerabilities, such as blocking the regime's \\"offshore hard currency reserves and income with financial sanctions, including secondary sanctions against its foreign enablers. This would significantly diminish, if not altogether deny, Kim the means to pay his military, security forces and elites that repress the North Korean public.\\" It is estimated by Kim B. Park of WHO panel that sanctions in 2018 resulted around 4000 preventable deaths due to delays in exemptions for programs by NGO's and the UN agencies that have humanitarian programs in North Korea The agricultural impact is highlighted in a report jointly made by the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization. The report outlines the negative effects on irrigation and yield in food production due to restrictions in machinery, spare parts, fuels and fertilizers.http://www.fao.org/3/ca4447en/ca4447en.pdfhttps://www.justsecurity.org/67473/sanctions- on-north-korea-are-counterproductive/ References Further reading External links *United Nations Documents for DPRK (North Korea) *UN Security Council Committee Established Pursuant to Resolution 1718 (2006) (Reports issued by the UN Panel of Experts, established to support of the Sanctions Committee in carrying out its mandate as specified in paragraph 12 of resolution 1718) Foreign relations of North Korea North Korea Economy of North Korea ","title":"Sanctions against North Korea"},{"id":"52467285","text":"Te√≥filo Duarte (6 October 1898 ‚Äì 16 May 1958) was a Portuguese colonial administrator, a military officer and a politician.

He is a former economics and politics student at Manchester Metropolitan University and a former organiser for the British National Party (BNP) youth wing, BNP Youth. On 12 June 2018, Renshaw pleaded guilty to preparing an act of terrorism with the intention of killing the Labour MP Rosie Cooper and to making a threat to kill a police officer. Early life Renshaw was born in Ormskirk and raised in Skelmersdale. As a child, Renshaw moved to Blackpool and later became involved with the English Defence League (EDL), aged 15. Through the EDL, he became \\"involved with the 'Justice for Charlene Downes' cause\\", and met British National Party (BNP) members and their leader Nick Griffin at one of the memorials. Renshaw had previously been disillusioned with the EDL after he found Israeli and gay pride flags on prominent display during their marches, and lamented that EDL leader Tommy Robinson was supporting \\"dark faces\\" being within the crowd.Herr Nordstorm (24 August 2015). \\"Kyle Hunt interview Jack Andrew Renshaw from UK\\". Renegade Broadcasting. Renshaw joined the BNP at age 15 against his parents' wishes. While an economic and politics student at the Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) in September 2013, Renshaw became the face of BNP Youth. In an interview with student newspaper The Tab, he claimed to have \\"had ethnic minority flatmates and some homosexuals\\" during his stay at university. Four years after joining BNP Youth, Renshaw decided to dedicate himself entirely to party campaigning, saying \\"I a lot of days canvassing when I should have been studying\\". He was eventually forced to leave MMU in September 2015 following a university investigation regarding his incitement to racial hatred. Renshaw wishes to bring back National Service and has previously said that he wished to join the British Army when he left university. He has an uncompromising attitude towards the War on Drugs, saying that \\"drug dealers should be hung from the nearest lamppost ... [lethal injection execution] would cost too much money for the taxpayer\\". Renshaw's application for the BNP to gain Student Union recognition was rejected by the union; Renshaw and the BNP Youth organised in protest at this decision. He views the British Royal Family as \\"Jewish vermin\\", \\"in the pockets of the Rothschilds\\" and believes that \\"the lot of them should hang\\". BNP Youth Organiser As an organiser in BNP Youth, the youth wing of the British National Party, Renshaw appeared in a much-derided 2014 video titled \\"BNP Youth Fight Back\\" which railed against \\"cultural Marxism\\", \\"militant homosexuals\\", \\"heartless Zionists\\", \\"political correctness\\", Islam, immigration, multiculturalism, Doreen Lawrence and other perceived societal ills and a perceived eradication of British identity. Writing for the Left Foot Forward, Mark Gardner noted, \\"At times the language and targets, 'Zionists', 'neo-Cons', 'capitalists', 'globalisation', resemble the modern extremes of far-Left, Islamist and (especially) New Age ideology. There is, however, nothing modern about BNP antisemitism, not even when they swap the word 'Zionist' for the word 'Jew' ... It is a very serious antisemitism that blames Jews for nothing less than the destruction of European nations. This is not neo-Nazism, it is old original Nazism, echoing Mein Kampf and Der Steurmer. In public broadcasts the party still targets Muslims for ugly racism, but within its own circles the deeper antisemitic ideology is resurrected.\\" Renshaw himself claims that Nick Griffin encouraged \\"radicalism\\" within the BNP while not wanting to be directly associated with it, saying that the BNP Youth video was more anti-Semitic at first, and that it was the BNP's media editor who removed references to Jews outright. Griffin disliked this decision, saying that \\"the parts about the Jews should have been kept in the video\\", according to Renshaw. In another BNP TV video Spreading Truth to Youth, Jack Renshaw spoke out against \\"banksters\\" such as the Rothschild family and claimed that allegations of the BNP's racism and fascism are \\"Talmudic\\". In another such video, Nationalism not Globalism, Renshaw claims that the European Union is part of a preliminary \\"global New World Order\\" in order for the Rothschilds to allegedly bind the globe via trillions of pounds of debt. He also blames \\"capitalists\\", \\"financial institutions\\" and \\"cultural Marxists\\" for \\"trying to mongrelise the races of the planet\\". A few months later, opposed to his dog's perceived homosexuality, Renshaw wrote on Facebook telling his pet Labrador Derek to not \\"challenge my principles\\" by \\"licking the penises of other male dogs\\". \\\\- \\\\- He has since stated that \\"the status about my dog was a joke. I have learnt my lesson, that's all I can say\\". Renshaw stood as a candidate for the BNP in the Waterloo by-election on 9 October 2014 that was triggered by the death of the Conservative councillor Tony Lee, gaining 17 votes. Spokesperson for National Action During a Yorkshire Forum event in 2015, Renshaw called for Jews to be \\"eradicated\\". As the spokesman for National Action, a far-right organisation within the United Kingdom, Renshaw said that he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler: Renshaw faced a criminal investigation by the West Yorkshire Police over the \\"potential antisemitic comments\\". In March 2016, the Liverpool Echo reported that Renshaw was thought to have been part of a group of neo-Nazi North West Infidels and National Action protestors in a rally in Liverpool. Using the Twitter name Jack Albion, he posted \\"[Shit], bricks, glass bottles etcetera - still we come back. We don't fight for ourselves but for an idea. #WR #Liverpool #NationalAction\\". Additionally, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was considering whether to charge Renshaw with inciting racial hatred over comments made at a public demonstration in Blackpool in March 2016, organised by the North West Infidels. In front of police officers and surrounded by a group of masked men, Renshaw described Jews as \\"parasites\\", claimed that white people were \\"a superior race\\" and stated that the UK took the \\"wrong side\\" in the Second World War by fighting the Nazis \\"who were there to remove Jewry from Europe once and for all\\". \\"When the time comes,\\" he said, antifascists will \\"be in the chambers ... and we'll execute them\\". Dave Rich, of the Community Security Trust, which represents the Jewish community on matters of antisemitism, said, \\"Anybody who is inciting hatred and violence of that kind needs to be dealt with fully by the law. Actions don't come from nowhere.\\" Nick Lowles of Hope Not Hate criticised perceived double standards in the justice system, saying that were such words to be uttered by an Islamist extremist, they would have been arrested. The CPS at that point had taken no action over Renshaw's comments. National Action was proscribed as a terrorist organisation following its conduct after the murder of Jo Cox and its support for her murderer Thomas Mair. In November 2016, Renshaw was facing criminal charges over incitement to racial hatred. In July 2017, he was charged by the CPS, under pressure from the Campaign Against Antisemitism. \\\\- In early 2018 Renshaw was convicted of two counts of stirring up racial hatred. Other activities (2014‚Äì2017) =\\"Hang Jews\\" post= The Jewish Telegraph revealed in 2014 that Renshaw had labelled Jews a \\"disease\\" on his blog, saying, Renshaw had also previously supported executing members of the \\"Jewish elite\\" for treason, saying on his blog, =National Strike Force= In 2014, Renshaw was photographed outside Manchester University's John Rylands Library on behalf of a new far-right group, the National Strike Force. The National Strike Force distributed 60 Greggs hot drinks vouchers to 12 \\"white British males\\" who were homeless. The Strike Force does not issue food to non- whites, and Renshaw himself has refused to give food to a \\"Romanian gypsy\\". =Golders Green march= In May 2015, the far-right blogger Joshua Bonehill- Paine planned a protest against the \\"Jewification of Britain [... and the] occupation force of approximately 50,000 Jews\\" in Golders Green, the heartland of London's Jewish community. Renshaw pulled out from speaking because he was supposed to be at work, one of the other booked speakers was Jewish, and because he disapproved of organiser Eddie Stampton. Plan to murder Rosie Cooper On 12 June 2018, the trial began of Renshaw and five others for alleged membership of the proscribed National Action. All denied this; however, Renshaw pleaded guilty to preparing an act of terrorism, namely the purchase of a machete, with a plan to kill Member of Parliament Rosie Cooper and threatening to kill a police officer who had been investigating him concerning child sex offences. \\\\- Co-accused, Christopher Lythgoe and Matthew Hankinson, were convicted of remaining members of the proscribed National Action but jurors were unable to decide either whether Renshaw had remained a member after the group was banned. During the trial it was alleged that Renshaw had rejected the suggestion from Lythgoe that he should instead kill the then home secretary Amber Rudd, arguing that she would be too protected. It was also claimed that Renshaw had dismissed Lythgoe's idea that he \\"do it in the name of National Action\\", saying that he would commit the act \\"in the name of white jihad\\". Renshaw was convicted at the Old Bailey on charges of engaging in conduct in preparation of a terrorist act (contrary to section 5, Terrorism Act 2006) and making a threat to kill (contrary to section 16, Offences Against the Person Act 1861). On 17 May 2019, the judge sentenced Renshaw to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 20 years, for the plan to kill Cooper and the police officer who was investigating him for child sex offences. Mrs Justice McGowan said that Renshaw's \\"perverted view of history and current politics\\" led him to \\"an attempt to damage our entire system of democracy\\". She said, \\"You praised the murder of Jo Cox in tweets and posts in June 2017. In some bizarre way you saw this as a commendable act and set out to replicate that criminal behaviour.\\" She added that Renshaw had made \\"detailed arrangements\\" to assassinate the MP.Regina v Jack Renshaw. Sentencing Remarks of Mrs Justice McGowan 17 May 2019. Retrieved 29 May 2019. These included buying a 19in (48 cm) Gladius knife, studying Cooper's itinerary and telling members of National Action about his plan during a meeting in a Warrington pub in July 2017. The plot was foiled by a whistleblower and former National Action member Robbie Mullen, who was secretly passing information to the anti-racism charity Hope not Hate, which informed police. Child sexual offences On 2 April 2019, at his trial for membership of National Action when the jury were unable to reach a verdict, it emerged that Renshaw had been convicted of child sexual offences in 2018 and sentenced to 16 months in prison. Renshaw had set up two fake Facebook profiles and contacted the boys, aged 13 and 14, between February 2016 and January 2017. Communicating via Facebook Messenger, he boasted that he was rich, could give them jobs and offered one of them ¬£300 to spend the night with him. He also requested intimate photographs of the pair, before one of them reported the messages and the police were contacted.Chris York, \\"Self- Confessed Neo-Nazi Jack Renshaw Is A Convicted Paedophile, It Is Revealed\\", Huffpost, 2 April 2019. Retrieved 2 April 2019. Renshaw admitted to the police that he had searched for gay pornography on the Internet, although he was often openly homophobic and told police he thought homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\". In his unsuccessful defence, Renshaw claimed, without providing any evidence, that all four of his phones were hacked by the anti-fascist charity Hope Not Hate; technical experts for the prosecution agreed that the alleged hacking was impossible. He was found guilty of four counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.

She participated in the capture of a French privateer and then sailed to the East Indies. She was laid up in 1819 and sold in 1824. War service On 25 May 1813, Captain Frederick Edward Venables Vernon was appointed to Challenger and commissioned her.Marshall (1829), Supplement, Part 3, pp.370‚Äì1. In July‚ÄìAugust, Challenger was part of a squadron of some 17 vessels that participated in the siege of San Sebasti√°n. Because of the shallowness of the water, only the smaller vessels could approach closely enough to bring their guns to bear on the town's defenses. Challenger suffered one casualty in this service: a seaman wounded on the island of Santa Clara. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the clasp \\"St. Sebastian\\" to the Naval General Service Medal to all surviving naval participants at the siege. Destruction of the Flibustier Octr 13th 1813. From a sketch by Captn Scriven, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich On 13 October 1813 caused the destruction of the French 16-gun brig Flibustier (1810) in the mouth of the Adour. Flibustier had been in St Jean de Luz sheltering where shore batteries could protect her when she sought to escape because of the approach of Wellington's army. She started out during a \\"dark and stormy night\\", but Telegraph immediately pursued her.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 30, p.428. After an action lasting three-quarters of an hour, the French saw Challenger and coming up to join the engagement. Flibustiers crew set her on fire and escaped ashore; she blew up before the British could capture her. She had been under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Jean-Jacques-L√©onore Daniel and armed with sixteen French 24-pounder carronades, two 9-pounder guns, a brass howitzer and four brass 3-pounder guns. There had been 160 men on board and Scriven reported that from what he saw, the French losses must have been considerable; Telegraph had no casualties. Scriven believed that Flibustier was bound for Santona to relieve the garrison there as her cargo consisted of treasure, arms, ammunition, and salt provisions. He also thought that some of the men who had been aboard her were officers and soldiers for the garrison. Both armies witnessed the British victory, with the allied army giving three cheers.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 30, pp.410‚Äì1. The Marquis of Wellington requested a naval demonstration on 10 November at Socoa in the rear of the French lines of communication. Admiral Keith dispatched four vessels to Saint-Jean-de-Luz: , Challenger, , and . However, the swell was so heavy that the naval vessels could do little beyond exchanging fire with the shore batteries there. On 18 December Challenger brought into Plymouth. Eliza Packet, from Malta, had found Blenden Hall at sea with no one aboard. At Plymouth Blenden Hall was reunited with her crew, which had arrived that same day on . The had put the crews of the five vessels she had captured (including Blenden Hall, which she abandoned), into Lusitania and released them. On 21 March 1814, Rear-admiral Penrose, in the 74-gun , anchored in the Gironde with a squadron that included Challenger. On 2 April the boats of captured one gun-brig, six gun-boats, one armed schooner, three chasse-mar√©es, and an imperial barge. They burned one gun-brig, two gun-boats, and one chasse-mar√©e.James (1837), Vol. 6, pp.258‚Äì9. The squadron shared the subsequent prize money. Two days later, the 74-gun joined Egmont to prepare for to attack the French 74-gun R√©gulus, three brig-corvettes, other vessels lying near her, and the batteries that protected them. Before the British could launch their attack, the French burnt R√©gulus and the other vessels. On 1 December 1814 Commander Henry Forbes replaced Vernon. Challenger was paid off in September 1815, and then underwent fitting for Channel service in September‚ÄìOctober. Post-war Forbes sailed Challenger to the East Indies in 1816. Between 8 and 11 April, he served on the court martial of Captain Robert O'Brien of for several acts of indiscipline vis-√†-vis Captain George Sayer, his senior officer. The court martial board found O'Brien guilty and ordered him dismissed the service.Marshall (1825), Vol. 2, Part 2, pp.881‚Äì4. However, O'Brien protested, with one of the grounds being that all the officers on the court martial board were junior to O'Brien. O'Brien was reinstated in March 1817. However, Forbes and Challenger had brought with them 600,000 dollars consigned to the government of Bengal, as well as other sums for Calcutta merchants. Because Challenger was at Madras for the court martial, Lieutenant John M'Arthur Low, commander (acting) of volunteered to carry the whole to Calcutta, without charging the normal freight service.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.10. On 1 May 1816 Forbes was appointed to . However, Philip Henry Bridges was acting commander of Zebra from December 1815 ‚Äì November 1816, when he was promoted into Challenger, replacing Forbes. Shortly after 18 November 1816 Challenger and the British East India Company's cruisers , , and Vestal sailed from Bushire on a punitive expedition against Ras-al-Khaimah. The squadron attacked on 1 December but could not approach the town closely enough for its fire to effect much damage. The squadron did burn some dhows before it withdrew. On 7 July 1818 the East Indiaman Cabalva wrecked on the rocky uninhabited island of Cargados, Cargados Carajos shoals. A party of 10 survivors sailed her cutter to Mauritius, where and Challenger happened to be at Port Louis. They set out immediately, arriving at the wreck site on 20 July. Magicienne remained on site to salvage what she could from the wreck site while Challenger removed the survivors and landed them at Mauritius. Later that year, Bridges transferred to , together with his crew from Challenger, to help man her. Then, as captain (acting), he sailed her to Portsmouth.Marshall (1832), Vol. 3, Part 2, p.17. Fate The Admiralty on 26 February 1818 ordered Challenger sold because of her \\"very defective state\\". She was hulked at Trincomallee and in May 1819 fitted to store rice. The next year she became a mooring tender. She was finally sold at Trincomallee for 3000 rupees in March 1824. Post script In January 1819, the London Gazette reported that Parliament had voted a grant to all those who had served under the command of Lord Viscount Keith in 1812, between 1812 and 1814, and in the Gironde. Challenger was listed among the vessels that had served under Keith in 1813 and 1814. She had also served under Kieth in the Gironde.

Body coloration often predominantly straw-yellowish to orange-reddish, in some species darker brown to black. Eye coloration of live animals often includes iridescent green. Legs comparatively long with prominent bristles, the length of the hind legs often roughly equals the length of the entire body. Forelegs about two-thirds as long as hind legs, with a short but distinctive curved spine at the anterior edge of each tibia. The claws of the hind legs are less than twice as long as the pulvilli. As is typical for Dasypogoninae, the harder cuticle of the prosternum is separated from the neck by an area of flexible cuticle that presumably allows for greater freedom of movement of the forelegs. This feature also occurs in some members of other asilid subfamilies.https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/65788 Artigas, J.N. & Papavero, N.

As with most asilids, known pupae of Diogmites species have prominent tooth- or hook-like anterior protrusions of the cuticle, which are technically referred to as antennal processes. In this genus there is one undivided pair of anterior antennal processes without any basal bristles, plus three posterior antennal processeshttp://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01868p098.pdf Dennis, D.S. 2008.

Ventral view of the prothorax in Diogmites angustipennis showing the reduced prosternum typical of the subfamily Dasypogoninae Front view of Diogmites angustipennis with claw-like spine at end of first tibia, a character typical for the genus. Another useful identifying character is the narrow face that is clearly less wide than each eye. Hanging Thief - Diogmites properans from Okeefenokee Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, showing the tibial spine and narrow face typical for the genus  Biology  Adults of Diogmites species hunt as ambush predators, taking off from a resting position on the ground or on branches to intercept other flying insects, or to pounce on perching/crawling prey. After prey capture, these flies will feed in a characteristic posture that has earned this genus the common name of Hanging Thieves: they will hang from plant stems or leaves suspended by one or both front legs, with the other legs holding and manipulating the prey while feeding. Presumably the relatively long legs and reduced prosternum of the genus are part of adaptations to facilitate feeding during this suspended posture. Hanging thieves should not to be confused with predatory scorpionflies of the family Bittacidae which are commonly called Hangingflies and which actually capture flying prey in a suspended posture. Many observations of the suspended feeding posture of Diogmites were caught on camera, for example Herschel Raney's webpage for Dasypogoninae includes images of D. angustipennis, D. platypterus and D. missouriensis feeding on a variety of insects.http://www.hr-rna.com/RNA/Main%20pages/Diogmites%20frame%20page.htm Chris Thawley has an interesting video of a feeding adult manipulating a large prey wasp while in hanging posture.https://thelizardlog.wordpress.com/2013/09/04/hanging-thieves/ Observations of the moment of prey capture are unfortunately not recorded yet in any literature or web resources. Some species can assume an unusual flight posture, with the first and last leg pairs raised high while the middle legs are extended downwards (personal observation of low-flying D. angustipennis males and females in central New Mexico). This might represent a peculiar type of hunting-related behavior more commonly referred to as orientation flights, or perhaps might serve purposes unrelated to hunting, such as a defensive posture to reduce odds of capture by dragonflies or other robberflies, or behavior intended to facilitate latching onto plant stems and leaves for landing. Robert Lavigne's Predator-Prey Database for the family Asilidaehttp://www.geller-grimm.de/catalog/lavigne.htm Predator-Prey Database for the family Asilidae has 443 records of observations for at least 20 species of Diogmites feeding on a wide range of prey, including other asilids as well as dragonflies. Particular species can be selective in prey choice however, for example D. crudelis was observed to feed on Diptera or Hymenoptera in 89 of 93 cases.http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=0&sid;=d9fe38ec-8014-4e1d-895e-0096a62eeb94%40sessionmgr4008 Dennis, D.S. 2015. Ethology of Diogmites crudelis Bromley, 1936 (Diptera: Asilidae) in Northeastern Florida, U.S.A. J. Entomol. Res. Soc. 17: 23-44. Very little is known about larval biology, but D. misellus and D. neoternatus larvae were respectively observed and surmised to feed on scarabaeid grubs. Larvae appear to live and pupate in soil, adults emerge after the pupae break through the soil surface to expose the anterior body. Whitney Cranshaw has captured emergence of an adult D. angustipennis in a series of remarkable photographs available at Zipcodezoo.http://zipcodezoo.com/index.php/Diogmites_angustipennis#mediadiv Norman Lavers' Illustrated Field Guide to The Robber Flies of Crowley's Ridge, Arkansas details egg-laying behavior of D. platypterus and includes a more detailed photo of a protruding pupal cuticle.http://normanlavers.net/dasypogoninae.php Diogmites properans (?) demonstrating the suspended feeding posture of a typical Hanging Thief Compare and contrast: this looks like Diogmites but is actually an extra large Caenarolia species from central Argentina.

Brown is a past Director of the Institute of Industrial Relations (IRLE) at UC Berkeley. Brown has published research on many aspects of how economies function, including high-tech industries, development engineering, the standard of living, wage determination, poverty, and unemployment. Clair Brown at the Brisbane Writers Festival, Sept'17  Early life  Brown was born in 1946 in Tampa, Florida. Her father, Norman Brown, was an attorney, and her mother, Mary Shackleford, graduated in economics from Florida State University. Brown was close to her African-American nanny, and realized at an early age that the discrimination against African-Americans and Cubanos was unjust and cruel. She graduated from Wellesley College with a math major in 1968. In 1973, Brown received her PhD in economics at the University of Maryland, where she studied under Barbara Bergmann and Charles Schultz. She was a doctoral fellow at the Brookings Institution, and then joined the UC Berkeley economics faculty in 1973. Clair is married to Richard Katz, and has two sons (Daniel and Jason) and two grandsons (Max and Timothy).  Career  Brown uses an institutional approach to economic analysis, where social rules and customs or norms structure firm and individual behavior that plays out in the marketplace, following in the long line from Veblen to Commons to Williamson. Her early research demonstrated that time and income were not substitutes in many household activities, and this observation has a major impact on women‚Äôs use of time, on the constraints faced by one-parent households, and on the constraints faced by unemployed people, as well as important implications for social policies. Then concerned about the standard of living, especially of the poor and working class, Brown began her study of U.S. household budgets. Using an institutional approach that assumes families based their own sense of well-being on how well they are doing compared to others, Brown used a relative income approach, which had been developed by Duesenberry. Following Marshall, Brown assumed that family expenditures could be divided into basics (necessaries), variety (comforts), and status (luxuries or positional goods). As the United States became agitated over the rapid rise of Japanese industry in the 1980s and 1990s, Brown studied the relationship between human resource systems and firm performance in the automobile and communication industries. This required fieldwork observation and data collection, from firms and workers in both the United States and Japan. Fieldwork data provided a way of verifying interpretations of large data sets and of the consistency of the data with observed behavior. In her work with Julia Lane using the Census LEHD data set, they demonstrated how rich field data combined with large survey data yield strong evidence for studying specific economic activities. Joining U.C. Berkeley‚Äôs Competitive Semiconductor Manufacturing Program headed by Dean Dave Hodges and Professor Rob Leachman in engineering, Brown headed the human resources group, with the goal of studying how the HR system structured worker input into problem solving and process improvements and how workers acquired new knowledge and skills. With her new focus on mostly well-educated men, Brown asked, ‚ÄúDoes education and then a good job allow people to achieve a middle-class life style and leave labor market problems behind?‚Äù The answer was a complicated ‚Äúno‚Äù. High-tech labor markets were undergoing a critical restructuring, and lifelong employment systems at leading multinational companies ended as companies adopted more market-oriented HR systems. Engineers faced problems as they were forced to change jobs. Many faced lower earnings and even unemployment as they aged. Once again, institutions mattered ‚Äì workers could no longer depend on an illustrious career at one company, and being put out to pasture seemed to be the norm. Rapid technological change was also a fact of life in the semiconductor industry, and the industry faced one crisis after another. Brown wrote a book with Dr. Greg Linden analyzing eight crises that the semiconductor industry dealt with successfully. As concern about globalization and US jobs grew, Brown teamed up with Tim Sturgeon and Julia Lane to develop a firm-based survey of global activities and employment in 2010. Brown expanded her research to include sustainability as global warming joined inequality as a challenge to economic policy, and this led to her development of Buddhist Economics as a field of study at UC Berkeley in 2011. Buddhist economics integrates global sustainability and shared prosperity to provide a holistic model of economic behavior and well-being. Her book Buddhist Economics: An enlightened approach to the dismal science will be published by Bloomsbury Press in February 2017. In 2013 at UC Berkeley, Brown helped create a new program called Development Engineering, for graduate students in engineering and economics to develop their multidisciplinary skills for designing, building, and evaluating new technologies to help developing regions. Using the Buddhist economics framework, Brown's team is developing a measure of economic performance based on the quality of life, and estimating it for state of California. This index integrates measurements of inequality and environmental degradation as well as value of non-market activities and consumption to provide an inclusive measurement of sustainable economic performance to evaluate our economic performance and to guide policy. Brown‚Äôs contributions to the field of Labor Economics were recognized by the Labor and Employment Relations Association, who awarded her their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010. Brown's economic approach and life as an economist is published in Eminent Economists II ‚Äì Their Life and Work Philosophies (Cambridge University Press, 2013).

Cannabis is widely produced in the country, being the nation's most significant cash-crop. In the 2000s it was estimated that 70% of the cannabis in South Africa originated in Lesotho. In 2017 Lesotho became the first African nation to grant a license for the cultivation of medical cannabis. Cannabis is known as \\"matekoane\\" in Sesotho language. History Cannabis use dates back to at least the 16th century in Lesotho, when the Koena people traded cannabis to the local San tribes in exchange for land around 1550. By the 19th century, cannabis was a staple crop in the kingdom. Cultivation Cannabis is cultivated almost everywhere in Lesotho, including the capital, but the primary cultivation is in the central mountain zones and western foothills. =Medical cannabis= In 2017, the Lesotho Ministry of Health licensed a South African firm to grow cannabis in Lesotho for medical and scientific purposes, the first such authorized establishment in Africa.Lesotho Just Granted Africa's First Legal Marijuana License - OkayAfrica In late 2017/early 2018, the Lesotho government licensed 5 companies to produce medical marijuana.

Cultivation is for the most part tolerated, however, due to the high rate of poverty in the nation and the economic benefits that the cannabis trade provides.

History  The idea behind WebTorrent is to make BitTorrent work on the web in a browser. Any web browser should be able to connect to a peer-to-peer swarm, fetch content, verify that it is correct, and display it to the user ‚Äì all as much as possible without centralized servers relying on a network entirely of people's browsers. @4:35+ Before WebTorrent the developers first tried PeerCDN (content delivery network) as a start up that sold to Yahoo in 2013. A goal of WebTorrent is to maintain compatibility with BitTorrent as much as possible. WebTorrent uses the same protocol as BitTorrent but uses a different transport. WebTorrent primarily relies on WebRTC connections, while BitTorrent uses TCP connections and UDP datagrams directly.  WebTorrent Desktop  The WebTorrent Desktop bridges the two networks of WebRTC-based WebTorrent and TCP/UDP-based BitTorrent simultaneously. The BitTorrent client Vuze (formerly Azureus) less gracefully but adequately functionally incorporated WebTorrent adding simultaneous network bridging to their software. The developers used Electron that makes desktop apps using JavaScript with access to all the APIs from Chrome and Node.  Functionality  Online video is the core focus as that is where WebTorrent is most useful. It is less suited for smaller files or data sets but is ideal for larger files. File availability, as with BitTorrents, is dependent on torrent seeding. If few users are sharing a file a HTTP server providing webseeding would be the fall back. There is no sharing without webseeding. However, this could have some positive implications. Rather than using a middleman upload site to share a large private file with another person, with WebTorrent you may directly connect without leaving traces somewhere or potentially being archived on some upload site. You simply drag and drop your file to create a magnet link you may share with your friend. Connections are already encrypted but you may add extra layers of encryption with keys to send another way. RAM limits may be managed with IndexDB.  Adoption  = BitChute = BitChute is a video hosting service that uses WebTorrent P2P technology in order to diffuse, redistribute, and ease bandwidth and issues of centralized streaming and to make it much more difficult for governments and corporations to censor, disrupt, and/or block access to videos after they are uploaded and sharing. = Brave = Brave web browser and PopChest are \\"open source supporters\\" of WebTorrent, as displayed on WebTorrent's homepage. = Safari = The Safari web browser is incorporating WebRTC and data channel support, as it is going to be in iOS 11, however, it will be requesting permissions from users for access to webcams according to rumours.

The house, garden and parkland are Grade I-listed with English Heritage, and 18 additional structures on the property are also listed. Shotover House, its gardens, parkland and the wider estate (known as Shotover Estate) are privately owned by the Shotover Trust. Shotover Park which lies on the north and east slopes of Shotover hill should not be confused with the more recently named Shotover Country Park, which is a public park and nature reserve on the southwest slopes of Shotover hill managed by Oxford City Council.Shotover Country Park, Oxford City Council Toponymy The source of the name Shotover is uncertain. One suggestion is that it comes from Ch√¢teau Vert (\\"Green Castle\\"), a French Norman Royal hunting lodge on the site. Novelist Robert Graves was a proponent of this theory, mentioning it in his classic book A Wife for Mr Milton. Another alternative is the Old English Scoet Ofer (\\"upper spur\\"). Shotover Hill is located to the east of Oxford, which rises to above sea level. In the Domesday Book of 1068, the location was identified as Scotorne. Up through the 13th century, patent rolls of King John and Henry III refer to Shotover variously as Scotore, Shotore, Shothore, and Shottovere. History =Shotover Lodge= The land encompassing Shotover Park was part of the Wychwood royal forest as far back as the Domesday Book. There was an \\"ancient\\" house on the site, celebrated as the location that Queen Elizabeth I selected for her reception to close her visit to Oxford in 1566. Oxford orator Roger Marbeck delivered a speech about Oxford University and the queen's valuable support for the university. The queen is recorded as saying upon her departure from Shotover, \\"Farewell the learned University of Oxford, farewell my good subjects there, farewell my dear scholars; and pray God prosper your studies.\\" John Locke was a frequent visitor to Shotover in the late 1670s to the early 1680s, and he stored papers and books there for safekeeping when he was forced to flee to Holland in 1683. Shotover came into the possession of the Tyrrell family after a freak hunting accident early in the 17th century. The story is that Timothy Tyrrell, Master of the Royal Buckhounds, was holding a dead stag for the teenaged Henry, Prince of Wales, eldest son of King James I. According to a chronicle of the unfortunate accident: \\"By his employment, [Tyrrell] held the Buck's head for the Prince to cut it off, in doing which His Highness cut the Master of the Buckhounds across the hand, which disabled him of the use of it forever.\\" In compensation, the prince granted the rangership of the Forests of Shotover and Stow Wood to Tyrrell. In 1613, following Prince Henry's death in 1612, King James confirmed the rangership by letters patent for the duration of the lives of Timothy Tyrrell and his two sons, Timothy (Master of the Buckhounds to King Charles I) and William. On 29 August 1624, King James knighted the elder Timothy Tyrrell at Shotover while attending a sporting hunt. He died in 1632. Originally from Oakley, Buckinghamshire, the Tyrrell family grew extremely powerful in the 17th century. The royal forest in Oxfordshire extended over Headington, Marston, and parts of 10 other parishes. However, ongoing fighting among the local population, as well as trees felled by the Royalists during the English Civil War, caused the forest to fall into such disarray that in 1660 the woodland was disafforested ‚Äì no longer subject to royal forest laws. The Tyrrells lived in a house known as Shotover Lodge or Shotover House, although it is unknown if it was the same house visited by Queen Elizabeth or a different building. Historian and political theorist James Tyrrell, grandson of Sir Timothy the elder, grew up at Shotover before moving to Oakley in 1670 after his marriage. Tyrrell divided his time between Oakley and Shotover. Tyrrell was a close friend of John Locke, whom he met at Oxford in 1658. Locke was a frequent guest at Shotover in the late 1670s and early 1680s, and he stored papers and books there for safekeeping when he was forced to flee to Holland in 1683. Tyrrell eventually sold Oakley and moved back to Shotover after James II forced him out of local governance in Buckinghamshire for refusing to sign the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687. =Shotover Park= Shotover engraving by George Bickham the Younger, 1750, showing the house prior to the additional wings added in the 1850s expansion Sir Timothy the younger died in 1701. The construction of the current Shotover Park began circa 1714‚Äì15 under his son James, and was located approximately east of the site of the house visited by Queen Elizabeth. In 1717‚Äì18, he built a Gothic temple at Shotover. The temple, with corner turrets, arcaded loggia, and battlemented gable, is possibly the first intimation of the Gothic Revival architecture in England. James died the following year and the construction of the building was continued under his son, Lieutenant-General James Tyrrell, an Army officer and MP. The architect of the new house commissioned by Sir Timothy is uncertain, but Shotover Park is believed to have been designed by William Townsend (or Townesend; 1676‚Äì1739), an Oxford architect and mason who worked on many buildings at Oxford University, and who was the son of Mayor of Oxford John Townesend. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner wrote in the Oxfordshire edition of his Buildings of England series that Shotover Park has strong similarities with The Queen's College, Oxford, linking it to Townsend. Construction was likely completed by 1720; the date 1718 does appear on rainwater heads. The design of the elder James Tyrrell's Gothic temple has been attributed to Townsend or to James Gibbs. Shotover Park was constructed of colour-washed limestone ashlar with a roof made of Westmorland and Welsh slate with stone stacks. The house is built to a double-depth plan, consisting of two storeys, plus a basement and attics. The initial house featured a seven-window front. In 1855, it was extended to 15-windows with two wings added on either side in a renovation by Joshua Sims. The Ionic pedimented porch, the arched front doorway and flanking arched windows are likely from the mid-19th century additions. The windows on the ground and first floors feature floating cornices, moulded architraves and sills supported on consoles. Octagon temple designed by William Kent, circa 1735 Early outbuildings and features at Shotover Park included three stables, a coach house, a granary, a barn, dairy, work house, a brewhouse, gardener's cottage, several gardens and nurseries with young trees, and six small fishponds. The formal garden on the site dates to 1718, which includes a Grade I-listed walled kitchen garden. Map of Shotover from the Ordnance Survey Great Britain County Series, 1898 In addition to the Gothic temple built for Sir Timothy, the garden includes a large obelisk and another temple designed by William Kent circa 1735. The obelisk was built to honour the visit of Queen Elizabeth and stands on the site of the ancient house she visited. The Kent temple was badly damaged in the 1980s by falling trees, but it was restored in 1988 with assistance from the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission. James Tyrrell died in 1742 and left the estate to the family of his friend, the Baron Augustus Sch√ºtz, a Hanoverian favourite of King George I, who became Master of the Robes to King George II. It passed to his son, George Frederick Schutz, who was Groom of the Bedchamber to King George III, and in turn to his son, Thomas James Schutz. When Thomas died, Shotover Park passed into the hands of the Drury family through his youngest sister Mary, who married Sir George Vandeput, 2nd Baronet. They left only one heir, a daughter Frances, who married Richard Vere Drury. Shotover passed to their son, George Vandeput Drury, who died without an heir in November 1849. In 1850, George Gammie (later Gammie-Maitland) bought Shotover, reportedly with the proceeds of the sale of property he owned in Australia. (His business partner, William Gilbert Rees, named Shotover River in New Zealand for Gammie.) Gammie-Maitland went bankrupt in 1871, when the estate was sold to Colonel James Miller. It stayed in the Miller family until 2006, owned by Alfred Douglas Miller and his son Sir John Miller, Crown Equerry and friend of Queen Elizabeth II. The royal family were frequent visitors to the estate; Princess Anne suffered a broken nose falling off a horse while riding at Shotover at age 15. Today Shotover Park has been held in a trust since 1964. More recent residents of the house include Major Alexander Alfred Miller (known as Alastair) and later his youngest brother Sir John Miller. Their nephew, Sir Beville Stanier, 3rd Baronet, is one of the trustees and his son, Alexander James Sinnott Stanier, now lives in the house. The park and estate cover .

It is a cenotaph dedicated to the Greek soldiers killed during war. It was sculpted between 1930 and 1932 by sculptor Fokion Rok. The tomb is guarded by the Evzones of the Presidential Guard. Construction The decision to build a monument was taken by army general and ‚Äúconstitutional dictator‚Äù Theodoros Pangalos. In his capacity as Army Minister, an advertisement was placed in the Espera newspaper, requesting a \\"submission for a study of the construction of a tomb of the Unknown Soldier, in front of the Old Royal Palace, suitable for this purpose\\". On 9 October 1926, the Army Ministry approved and granted by majority the study made by architect Emmanuel Lazaridis. The location of the monument at the Old Palace was suggested both by the architect himself and by Pangalos, who wish for the Army Ministry to be housed in the building. However in 1929, after fervent reaction and continuous meetings, Eleftherios Venizelos, setting aside his disagreements with Pangalos, decided that the best location would be the original one in Syntagma Square, reasoning that the Monument ought to be in the city centre, much like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Inauguration, 1932, with a presence of a Turkish delegation The construction committee had given all responsibility for the construction to Lazaridis. Initially, he had worked with sculptor Thomas Thomopoulos who had proposed as a central sculpture a representation of the Gigantomachy with an angel (representing Greece) lovingly receiving the dead soldier. Despite Lazaridis initially agreeing to this design, Thomopoulos's sculpture was never built due to lack of funds. In 1930, Lazaridis instead assigned Fokion Rok as sculptor with a unanimous decision of the construction committee. The committee then approved a new proposal for the sculpture, a gunner lying on the ground. This design was deemed appropriate owing to its calmness and simplicity. For the construction, a large-scale excavation and levelling of terrain took place. The Tomb was unveiled on 25 March 1932 by then Prime Minister Andreas Michalakopoulos, with the participation of many foreign delegations, followed by a parade of the monument guard. At the same time, a torch was brought from the monastery of Agia Lavra to light the eternal flame in the centre of the cenotaph. Style and inscriptions General view The Tomb is in the French urban and classical tradition, combined with the modern spirit of Art Deco and with symbolic references to Ancient Greece. The main issue was the integration of the Tomb with Syntagma Square and with the neoclassical Palace and the contribution to the redevelopment of the square. The Tomb is a large-scale Œ†-shaped retaining wall of limestone. The sculpture is at the centre of the wall. To the left and to the right there are two side staircases while in the centre there is a rectangular raised grave. The stairs of the monuments are purely decorative, as the steps are for observation during ceremonies. The sculpture represents the naked male figure of a dead warrior lying on the ground. He holds a circular shield in his left hand and wears an Ancient Greek-style helmet. The representation of the body gives the impression that the Unknown Soldier is ready to arise at any moment. To the left and right of the sculpture are phrases from the works of Thucydides. To the left, \\"\\" (\\"There's one empty bier made up for the unidentified [fallen] ones\\"); to the right, \\"\\" (\\"The whole earth is the sepulchre of famous men\\").

Members of this clade are widespread in deep-sea hydrothermal environments are believed to be crucial components of microbial communities and hydrothermal ecosystems.

Distribution, abundance, and diversity patterns of thermoacidophilic \\"deep-sea hydrothermal vent euryarchaeotha 2. 3:1-17 Organisms belonging to the DHVE2 have been shown to be thermoacidophilic, capable of surviving high temperatures in additional to acidic (low pH) conditions. The acidic habitats that allow these archaea to flourish are generated, in part, by geothermal, geophysical, and geochemical processes that occur at the ocean floor near the opening of the deep-sea ridges. Cultivation of these organisms is difficult and only 12 axenic strains have been isolated from 6 vent fields. Similarly, replicating the environmental conditions of the hydrothermal vent systems is difficult to do in laboratory settings and often results in more fastidious deep-sea organisms outcompeting the DHVE2. To date the only cultured representative of the DHVE2 group is Aciduliprofundum boonei which is described as an obligate thermoacidophilic heterotroph capable of fermenting peptides for energy and carbon. A. boonei has a unique S-layer which is more flexible and allows it to generate vesicles that bud off the cells. Further, this particular archaeon reveals unique genomic arrangement of its flagellar genes suggesting horizontal gene transfer or reductive evolution of its flagella production pathway.Reysenbach AL, Liu Y, Banta A, Beveridge T, Kirshtein J, Schouten S, Tivey M, Von Damm K, Voytek M 2006.

The band's lineup consisted of Tim Landers (ex-Transit) on guitar and vocals and Brad Wiseman (ex-This Time Next Year) performing vocals. Since their formation in 2010, the band has released three EPs and one full-length album. The band has toured with bands such as Transit, Diamond Youth, The Wonder Years, Hostage Calm, and Fireworks.  History  Misser started as the solo project of Landers while he was still playing in Transit. Landers wrote six songs and tracked them with Dan Rose (of Daybreaker). Jay Maas was set to mix and master the tracks, but the project files were instead deleted from his computer. A few months later Landers released those songs online in their original state. Landers was later approached by Justin Collier of Lost Tape Collective and he agreed to release three of the original six songs on cassette along with a cover of Archers of Loaf's ‚ÄúWeb in Front.‚Äù While at a mutual friend's house, Landers and Wiseman discussed the possibility of playing in a band together. Landers would go on to tell Wiseman about the songs that he had previously written. The next time Landers visited California the two re-recorded two of the original six tracks and wrote an additional one, creating the Problems. Problems. Problems. EP. The EP was officially released on Bandcamp in December 2011. On January 10, 2012, the band announced via Facebook that they had signed to Rise Records and were planning release a full-length album. It was also announced via Alternative Press that Gary Cioffi had signed on to produce the band's debut full length. The album, Every Day I Tell Myself I'm Going To Be A Better Person, was released on May 15, 2012. In December 2012 it was announced that Misser would tour supporting The Wonder Years, along with Fireworks and Hostage Calm in the Spring of 2013. On March 6, 2013 the song ‚ÄúGoddamn, Salad Days‚Äù premiered on Revolvermag.com. On May 23, 2013 the bands streamed new EP, Distancing, via PropertyOfZack. The EP was officially released on May 28 through Rise Records. In December 2013 the band played a series of holiday shows with Long Lost and Transit. Misser went through a period of inactivity, with Landers working on a different musical endeavor called Cold Collective. On August 5, 2016 Misser were announced as direct support for Set Your Goals on a series of shows celebrating the 10 year anniversary of the band's debut album, Mutiny!.

It was described in 2011 and is known from only two specimens. Taxonomy The Vietnam ferret-badger is a member of the genus Melogale, which contains another four species. Two of these, the Burmese ferret-badger and the Chinese ferret-badger, occur together with it in the same region. The Vietnam ferret-badger was assigned to a separate species by comparing the holotype to a limited number of specimens of these two species. As this does not take into account many other Melogale specimens held worldwide, it is as of 2016 unclear whether the name given to the species is valid with regard to earlier synonyms. Pending verification, the name M. cucphuongensis has been provisionally accepted by the IUCN in its assessment. Discovery In March 2005, a living ferret-badger that looked different from all known ferret-badger species was confiscated by rangers from C√∫c Ph∆∞∆°ng National Park in Vietnam. Unfortunately, this animal died and the carcass was disposed of. A year later, in January 2006, a freshly dead individual of the same phenotype was found at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center (EPRC) in C√∫c Ph∆∞∆°ng National Park. Due to several markedly different characteristics (namely its dark brown head and body, its black and white stripe running from its neck to its shoulders, and the shape of its skull), these specimens were assigned to a new species.  Distribution and habitat  The only two specimens known come from a site that consists of a compound of buildings in a degraded lowland evergreen forest fringe (second specimen) and from a location near it (first specimen), in the C√∫c Ph∆∞∆°ng National Park in Northern Vietnam, in the Ninh B√¨nh Province. It is not known whether this site is representative of the species' habitat. The site is situated on limestone, which has given rise to the speculation that the species might depend on a karst habitat, as do other animals in the region. Conservation The Vietnam ferret-badger is currently classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN, and no specific threat estimate is deemed possible. The species is probably under hunting pressure, as the site is heavily hunted and one of the specimens had apparently escaped from a snare (although the presence of the ferret-badgers indicates that they may not be heavily impacted by this). Habitat loss due to deforestation is a general threat to ecosystems in the region, which likely applies to this species as well.

Giber √Ö and surroundings is a protected Natura 2000 site. The protection is mainly located in the Marselisborg Forests approximately 4 miles south of the city of Aarhus.  Course  Giber √Ö springs from the bog of Testrup Mose, south of the suburb Tranbjerg, and runs through the town of M√•rslet, past Vilhelmsborg Manor, before winding through Vilhelmsborg Forest and Moesg√•rd Forest, to finally empty in Aarhus Bay by Moesg√•rd Beach. The smaller streams of Balleb√¶k, Morseb√¶k, Hovedgr√∏ften and Kapelb√¶k merges with Giber √Ö along its way, and the stream is also fed by the water treatment plants of the area. Since medieval times, Giber √Ö has marked the border between Beder and M√•rslet Parishes, and today the stream outlines the northern border of the local municipal administrative area \\"Beder-Malling-Ajstrup\\". Giber √Ö is unregulated, although it has through time been used by water treatment plants at Vilhelmsborg, Fulden Mill and Moesg√•rd Forest Mill. North of the mouth of the stream is a flat valley which stretches to the stone dykes at Moesg√•rd Forest. The area is open and managed as a recreational area with scattered trees and solitary conifers (Juniperus communis).  Ecology  In 2004, Moesg√•rd Beach, by the outlet of Giber √Ö, was one of 18 Danish beaches hit by a bathing moratorium due to high levels of E. coli bacteria, stemming from the municipal water treatment plants that use the stream as a recipient. Regardless, sea trout travel through Giber √Ö and can be found in the streams that feed it. Trout has been found as far upstream as Hovedgr√∏ften and Kapelb√¶k, a stream originating in H√∏rret Forest. Aarhus Municipality works with locals to establish fish ladders to improve conditions for fish in the stream. The white-throated dipper winters in Denmark and can be found at Giber √Ö and associated streams. Giber √Ö has in periods had a very low water level due to water being redirected to agriculture and household use. The former √Örhus County decided the stream could be supplemented with water from a rain water basin in Tranbjerg and if necessary groundwater.

It is the 22nd film in the Pretty Cure franchise, originally created by Toei Company under the Izumi Todo pseudonym. It was directed by Hiroshi Miyamoto and written by Tsubota Fumi. It debuted in Japanese theaters on March 18, 2017. The film marks as the first film in the Stars series, which replaced the Pretty Cure All Stars crossover film serials. The motif of the film is based on Japanese mythology, with wa as the main theme of the film. Plot After school, Ichika meets up with her friends and they talk about her dream, where Sakura and Shizuku run from Akainu and Kiinu through a cherry blossom forest, and Ichika and Pekorin go towards a hill and sets up a picnic next to a tree stump. She spots the girl from her dream, Sakura, who tries to take Ichika's cupcake, noticing there is a pastry on one of the three cards Shizuku gave her. Ichika is confused and they are argue, before Akainu appears and attacks them. Ichika transforms into Cure Whip to fight Akainu, which makes Sakura realize that the cards' purpose is to search for the Pretty Cure represented by the item on the card. After an overpowered Cure Whip hides, Sakura wishes she was able to aid Cure Whip. The miracle light glows and glows a door Sakura goes through, where she briefly instructs the audience on the Miracle Lights. The others arrive and revert Akainu back into the origami form. After an explanation, the girls consider that what happens to Sakuragahara affects the cherry blossoms in their world, and they discuss on how to find the Cures of the Keys and of the Jewels. Ichika, Himari and Aoi go to the Magical World where they inspect Mofurun due to her jewel with the symbol of the cards on it. When they land in the heart of the shopping district, a Yokubaru starts attacking. The Mahou Girls transform and are having trouble. They are thrown away by the Yokubaru. Sakura helps take Ichika, Himari, and Aoi to Ichigozaka. Yukari and Akira go to Noble Academy where the latter intimidates Yur Nanase trying to get keys off of her. The Princess Pretty Cures show up to confront Akira, before they transform and throw a Zetsuborg into the air and Sakura teleports them to the landing area, where the combined Cure teams are able to beat the monsters. Later, a mysterious girl named Samidare pins down the transformation devices and tries to hit Sakura, but she can't bring herself to so she retreats. At the KiraKira Patisserie to eat dinner and dessert, Sakura is saddened by watching the Cures interact and remembers Shizuku, and Ichika follows after her after seeing her leave. Sakura tells Ichika her story with Shizuku and their promise to see the cherry blossoms bloom. Ichika then says that tears and sadness causes happy moments to be sweeter. The Miracle Light glows and forms a door at the tree stump, which Sakura opens for the Cures to enter Sakuragahara. When they arrive, they are met by Akainu and Kiinu, who both merge into Ooinu, and Karasu Tengu greets Sakura and says that they wanted to own her ability to open portals so they can travel to different worlds. The Cures try to pin down Ooinu, but this is proven difficult. The Cures, except Cure Flora because she was stuck in a tree, grab onto the floating stones around Ooinu's head. Ooinu spins the stones in hopes of shaking them off. This ends up sending the Cures and Ooinu flying through the air. Ooinu crashes while the Cures land safely. Samidare appears and turns most of the Cures into origami except Whip and Sakura who try to escape, but Samidare jumps to the top of the torii path, leaving them with no choice but to fight back. Whip uses her hearing to trace Samidare's attack, and upon hearing her positioning her right foot to throw her crane, Whip leaps up and kick Samidare, shattering half of her mask. The injured Samidare opens her eye, which Sakura recognizes as Shizuku's, and she is shocked over the fact that Shizuku is now evil. Karasu Tengu arrives to mock them and attempts to control Samidare again, but Whip attacks Karasu Tengu before they could do anything. Their spell causes the weather to change to rain. As it pours, Whip is still determined to save Shizuku and tries to get Sakura to join her, but she still feels depressed over how she doesn't remember her anymore. However, Whip encourages her, but before anything is done, Karasu Tengu attacks Whip and sends her crashing into the mud. Karasu Tengu then proceeds to taunt her, but a determined Whip stands up and vows to help her family and friends. Her declaration causes the Miracle Sakulight to glow and return Sakuragahara to normal. Sakura takes this opportunity to pounce on top of Samidare and try to get her to remember her true form as Shizuku. When she gets through to her, the second half of the mask shatters and Shizuku returns. In addition to that, the other Pretty Cure have been turned back to normal, and Karasu Tengu turns into their powered-up form. As the Cures get ready to fight Karasu Tengu, Sakura and Shizuku meet up with them, and the latter tells the group that she has a plan, leading Whip to call a one-minute timeout. During that time, they discuss the plan and once they were done, Whip and Sakura tell the audience to support them using the Miracle Lights. After that, they begin their attack, with the Cures charging at Karasu Tengu, and Sakura and Shizuku running down the torii path. The Princess and Mahou Tsukai Cures attack first, followed by the KiraKira Cures, who use the Goldfish Daifuku Animal Sweet to produce a giant fist of Kirakiraru to strike Karasu Tengu. When that is not enough, the other Cures arrive to lend their support. As Sakura and Shizuku run down the torii path, Sakura recalls taking it with Shizuku back when she was scared, but now that she has encountered the Cures, she has become braver. After Sakura took a moment to catch her breath, she makes it to the door and uses the Miracle Saku Light to open it. Meanwhile, all of the Cures are now guiding a giant form of Whip made of Kirakiraru. Whip is afraid at first because the form's arms were too short, but when Karasu Tengu attacks, her massive hair blocks the hit instead. Just then, Sakura and Shizuku appear through a portal above them and they attack Karasu Tengu themselves. Karasu Tengu tries to fend the two off, but Shizuku is able to bite a weak spot, the nose, and it causes Karasu Tengu to revert to their normal form. This gives the Cures the opportunity to attack and they collide with Karasu Tengu in an explosion of fireworks, defeating the mountain spirit once and for all. After the battle, the Cures, along with Sakura and Shizuku, have their flower viewing, with them all interacting with each other. During the viewing, Whip thinks about trying to become stronger and braver by herself, and it didn't turn out well, but when she tried it with her friends, it started to work. Whip then tells Sakura that she helped make her dream of viewing the flowers with all of her friends come true and thanked her for it.

Production The film was announced after the screening of Witchy Pretty Cure! The Movie: Wonderous! Cure Mofurun!, with the official website opened at October 29, 2016. The film is hinted as a film that is \\"not an All Stars\\" film and will start a fresh new storyline away from the previous crossover series. Similar to All Stars, the film is a non-canonical crossover between series, specifically Go! Princess PreCure, Witchy PreCure and Kirakira PreCure a la Mode alongside two new characters made for the film. In addition, producer Takashi Washio stated that only three current Pretty Cure teams will be used due to the film's focus on the most current generation teams rather than relying on using the previous generation, a problem encountered while producing the All Stars movies. In addition of the film being animated in traditional animation, the film also featured 3D Cel-Shaded backgrounds and animation, similar to what was shown in Go! Princess PreCure the Movie: Splendid! Triple Feature! The 3D scenes in the film were modeled closely to Japanese shrines and locations to give a more distinct feel than the previous films. While discussing the film's theme, Washio said Japanese mythology and the term were chosen, which he stated was a very difficult theme to work with due to concerns that \\"it may distance the film away from children\\". However, its theme can also reveal the beauty and depth of Japanese culture, and hopefully it will be received well with children, alongside other themes from previous films. The movie also shares similarities with Kado: the Right Answer. Another Toei CGI Anime with same animation style from Dream Stars!. Music The film's score was composed by Yuki Hayashi. The film's opening theme is titled by Rie Kitagawa while the ending song is titled by Yoshino Kimura.

The flowers are white or cream- coloured and arranged singly in upper leaf axils on a stalk long and sticky. The flowers are surrounded by leafy bracts long. The five sepals are long and sticky with lance-shaped lobes and joined to form a short tube for about half their length. The five petals are joined to form a tube long and mostly glabrous except for a densely hairy ring inside the tube. There are five lobes on the end of the petal tube, the lower one broad egg-shaped to almost round and slightly larger than the other four lobes. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1979 by Ahmad Abid Munir who gave it the name Pityrodia glutinosa and published the description in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. In 2011, Barry Conn Murray Henwood and Nicola Streiber resurrected the genus Dasymalla and transferred this species to it as Dasymalla glutinosa. The specific epithet (glutinosa) is a Latin word meaning \\"viscous\\" or \\"sticky\\". Distribution Dasymalla glutinosa occurs between the Murchison River and Shark Bay in the Carnarvon, Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions growing in sand on sandplains and dunes and in woodland. Conservation Dasymalla glutinosa is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

Early life and education Evens was born in Copenhagen, the son of brazier Thomas Mandix Evens (1791-1870) and his wife Ane Margrethe Frederiksen (1790-1853). He was articled to his father and later J. Dalhoff. In 1843, he was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts and became an assistant in Herman Wilhelm Bissen's studio when he was in his twenties. He won the Academy's small silver medal in 1846, its large silver medal in 1849 and the small gold medal in 1851 for Thetis b√∏nfalder Vulkan om Vaaben til Achilles. In 1857, after several unsuccessful attempts, he won the Neuhausen Prize for the group sculpture Maternal Love (Moderk√¶rlighed). He spent a couple of months in Paris in 1856 and was in Italy in 1858-61 on a stipend from the Academy. In 1865, he returned to Italy on a grant from the Ancher Foundation (Det Ancherske Legat). Career Evens belonged to the group of sculptors who, with Bissen and H. E. Freund, continued the Beoclassical tradition from Bertel Thorvaldsen but gradually represented the transition to Naturalism. Evens remained a minor figure in Danish sculpture. His works include a memorial to Ewald and Wessel at Trinitatis Church in Copenhagen (1879). He also contributed to the decoration of the Marble Church with the statue of Hieronymus and created the group sculpture Faun and en Satyr for the complex at Gammeltorv in Aalborg (1850) and A Neapolitan Fisherman Teaches His Son to Play the Flute for Store Strandstr√¶de in Copenhagen and on Rustenborgvej in Lyngby-Taarb√¶k (1861).

Overview The company has its own GPS-enable booking system, and allows any nearby taxi service to pick up a fare regardless of which taxi service they work for. The company was the first transportation service company in Australia to provide riders with fixed fares, which included all tolls and charges, and no surge pricing or extra fees due to traffic jams. Ingogo's system allows users to book a taxi up to two days in advance. The company has focused on gaining corporate clients such as Qantas. History In 2011, entrepreneur Hamish Petrie convinced Moshtix, a company Petrie founded in 2003 and later sold to News Digital Media in 2007, that his idea was workable. In May 2014, the company closed its internet-based tax receipt service when it was discovered that a security flaw enabled people to access information about clients, the last four digits of credit card numbers and taxi number plates. In 2015, Ingogo raised $12 million in a funding round that valued the company at $100 million. It claims to have raised more than $16 million in total from Australian investors. More than $4 million came from crowdfunding alone, which was a record on the Australian equity-crowdfunding platform VentureCrowd. The Australian Federal Government has also given the company a grant. Another investor was MYOB co-founder Brad Shofer. In December 2016, the company postponed plans for a float on the Australian Securities Exchange. It was reportedly considering preference shares or a rights issue in the short term.

Early migrations (before 1800s) Many of Tamil emigrants who left shores of Tamil Nadu before 18th Century and mixed with countless other ethnicities. In medieval period Tamilians emigrated as soldiers, traders and labourers settled in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and intermixed well with local population, while few communities still maintain their language and culture. Many groups still claim descent from this era Tamil emigrants such as Kaikadis of Maharashtra, Thigalas, Hebbars of Karnataka, Velamas of Northern Andhra, Chittys of Malaysia, and some section of Sri Lankan Tamils such as Sri Lankan Chetties, Bharatha people, Batticalao Mukkuvars, Negombo Tamils, Jaffna Saiva Vellalars. Medieval Migration (1800 - 1950)  During this period British, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Danish colony administrators recruited a lot of local Tamilians and took them to their overseas colonies to work as labourers, petty administration officers, clerical and military duties. In the 19th century, Madras Presidency (of which the Tamil Nadu region was a core part of) faced brutal famines. Great Famine of 1876‚Äì78. Tamil Nadu was both politically and economically weak. Britishers thus made use of Tamil workers for their plantations to all over the world - significantly in Malaysia, Mauritius, South Africa, Sri Lanka (distinct from the Sri Lankan Tamils) and also as far as Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad. Some of the Tamil groups (especially Chettiyars, Pillais, Muslims) emigrated as commercial migrants. These groups then dominated the trade and finance in primarily in Myanmar, Singapore, and other places. The first Indian to own a merchant ship during the British times comes from this group. There also a group of people from French Tamil colonies of Pondicherry and Karaikal emigrated and settled in other parts of the world, significantly in France, R√©union, Seychelles and the French Caribbean islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. These Tamilians well integrated, assimilated with their adopted countries, and became part and parcel of local populations in Mauritius, South Africa, Guyana, and Fiji. Where as Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka, and Tamil Malaysians of Malaysia were evolved into distinct ethnic nationalities of their own but retaining their ancestral language and religion in their new homelands.  Modern Migration (1950 - present)  In the second half of the 20th century, around 3.5 million Tamils emigrated from Tamil Nadu as skilled professionals, workers to various parts of India like Bangalore, Mumbai, Andaman Islands and also countries like UAE, USA, Singapore and so on. Some of them got citizenship of respective countries but still having strong family and cultural ties with Tamil Nadu, than those who migrated before 1950, who lost touch with their ancestral links in Tamil Nadu. Bangalore city have a large Tamil population. It was built in 1537, and became split between its Kannadiga and Tamil residents in the 19th century. In 1991, 28% of Bangalore population of 4 million (i.e. 1.1 million) spoke Tamil. but dropped to 14% (1.5 million) in the 2011 census. Portion of them trace their ancestry to the large number of Tamil speaking soldiers, suppliers and workers who were brought into the Bangalore Civil and Military Station, by the British Army, after the fall of Tippu Sultan.

Soroeta's governorship is notable only in that it was in name only; he never ruled nor was accepted as governor within colonial Paraguay. Biography Soroeta was born in √âibar in Basque Country to noble parents. He left for Spain's overseas empire at some point, and became a corregidor in Cuzco. The Viceroy of Peru, the Marquis of Castelfuerte, appointed him as the new governor of Paraguay to take over for interim governor Mart√≠n de Bar√∫a. Unfortunately for Soroeta, rumors spread in Paraguay that Soroeta was an ally of the hated Jesuits and disliked former governor Diego de los Reyes Balmaseda, while the popular Bar√∫a had been an opponent of the Jesuits during his term as governor. Despite the entreaties of former governor Bar√∫a and Bishop Palos during December 1730, the citizenry wished to deny entry to their new governor; Bar√∫a resigned in frustration, and elections to the cabildo put a new slate of members hostile to Soroeta and the Jesuits. When Soroeta arrived at the outskirts of Asunci√≥n, Paraguay in January 1731, he was refused entry by the citizenry. He was allowed to briefly tour the city for 4 days, but after being convinced that he would be unable to actually take up the governorship, he left on January 28, leaving the governorship vacant. Soroeta returned to Lima, the viceregal capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. His report of the troubles in Paraguay led to the execution of disgraced former governor Jos√© de Antequera y Castro and his advisor Juan de Mena; the Viceroy was convinced that Antequera had sympathizers or allies who were behind the rejection of Soroeta. Soroeta's rejection is considered the beginning of the second phase of the Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay.

This index is minimized by the largest remainder (LR) method with the Hare quota. Any apportionment method that minimizes it will always apportion identically to LR-Hare. Other methods, including the widely used divisor methods such as the Webster/Sainte-Lagu√´ method or the D'Hondt method minimize other disproportionality indexes instead. The index is named after John Loosemore and Victor J. Hanby, who first published the formula in 1971 in a paper entitled \\"The Theoretical Limits of Maximum Distortion: Some Analytic Expressions for Electoral Systems\\". Along with Douglas W. Rae's, the formula is one of the two most cited disproportionality indices. Whereas the Rae index measures the average deviation, the Loosemore‚ÄìHanby index measures the total deviation. Michael Gallagher used least squares to develop the Gallagher index, which takes a middle ground between the Rae and Loosemore‚ÄìHanby indices. The LH index is related to the Schutz index of inequality, which is defined as :S = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i - a_i, where e_i is the expected share of individual i and a_i her allocated share.

It is directed by Rusty Mills and features the voices of Rob Paulsen and Maurice LaMarche. It is about the eponymous genetically modified mice, who are bent on world domination, attempting to deceive Santa Claus into delivering hypnotic devices as presents during Christmas. Although released on DVD with season 1 of the series, A Pinky and the Brain Christmas was originally aired December 13, 1995 on The WB as a prime time special. It won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. Plot While Pinky is writing his Christmas list to Santa Claus, whom he believes in with great faith, Brain is developing a new hypnotic doll called Noodle Noggin. Brain calculates that by manufacturing and distributing one billion Noodle Noggins, the world's population can be hypnotized into accepting Brain as ruler. When Brain spots on an advertisement for jobs as Santa's workshop, he realizes the elves would be ideal to make the dolls, and Santa can deliver them. The mice set off by plane, hiding in a dummy while a female pilot unwittingly flies them to the North Pole. Pinky and the Brain disguise themselves as elves and are assigned to the mail room by the surly head elf, Schotzie. The Brain subversively adds a Noodle Noggin to each Christmas list, causing the elves to scramble through their archives looking for the schematics. Eventually, Schotzie realizes Pinky and the Brain are not real elves, and the mice are captured by the workshop staff. The elves discover the Noodle Noggin schematics in the possession of the mice, with Schotzie demanding to know if the mice are spies for the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, or Herschel, the Hanukkah Goblin. The Brain and Pinky then escape and disguise themselves as two reindeer to get a ride back to their home at Acme Labs. The two see Santa approaching his sleigh, but Brain restrains Pinky from giving Santa his Christmas list. While in flight, the two mice fall from the sleigh into the labs, unintentionally damaging Brain's hypnotic control equipment. As they rush to repair it, Pinky discovers his list was never delivered and breaks down into tears. As Pinky sobs uncontrollably, Brain angrily reads the letter and is surprised to see Pinky asked for nothing for himself, requesting that all of his gifts be delivered to the Brain instead. Brain is deeply moved, and when Pinky informs him the Noodle Noggins are working, Brain is too emotional to demand world domination. He orders everyone to have a Merry Christmas instead, and smashes the equipment in a fit of rage. On Christmas Day, Pinky and the Brain exchange gifts, an Earth-shaped keychain for the Brain and a spell checker for Pinky. Production The special was produced by Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television, based on a teleplay by Peter Hastings and directed by Rusty Mills.William D. Crump, The Christmas Encyclopedia, Third ed., McFarland & Company Publishers, 2013, p. 336. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg was credited as the special's executive producer, although author Frank Sanello expressed skepticism Spielberg personally worked on the special each day.Frank Sanello, Spielberg: The Man, the Movies, the Mythology, Taylor Trade Publishing, 2002, p. 257. In one scene in the workshop, Pinky reads they are invited to a party at the home of Donner the reindeer, which Brain dismisses with reference to the historical Donner Party. While the cannibalism joke would likely not be understood by younger viewers, voice actor Maurice LaMarche explained that producer Tom Ruegger had once told him, \\"I want this to be a show, and Steven wants this to be a show, that adults and kids can enjoy together and doesn't talk down to one group or pander to the other.\\" Broadcast and release After Pinky and the Brain was spun off Animaniacs, the series was aired on The WB on Sunday evenings. A Pinky and the Brain Christmas marked the prime time debut, airing on The WB on the night of Wednesday, December 13, 1995 as a special. A Pinky and the Brain Christmas was later included in the DVD Pinky and the Brain Vol. 1, released by Warner Home Video. The episode was also streamed on Amazon.com in 2016.

History The building occupied by the Puzzle Mansion started as a rest house for the family of puzzle collector, Georgina Gil- Lacuna and also as a private display site for Gil-Lacuna's finished puzzles. The concept for the museum was first made in 2011 by puzzle collector Georgina Gil-Lacuna and her son Gino Orda who were concerned on where to store the puzzle collection of Gil-Lacuna. They learned through the internet that the biggest recognized collector of puzzles was a woman from Brazil who has over 230 puzzles. Gil-Lacuna at that time had 800 puzzles. In November 19, 2012 she was proclaimed by Guinness to be the new holder of the feat, with 1,030 puzzles finished at the time of the proclamation. The museum opened to the public in 2012. Aside from a museum the place was also made into a bed-and- breakfast place. In October 2014, it was reported that the museum hosts about 1,500 puzzles. Facilities The museum building is situated within a 1 hectare lot. Collection The collection of the museum dates back in the 1980s when its founder and puzzle collector Georgina Gil-Lacuna bought a 5,000-pieces Mickey Mouse jigsaw puzzle from Hong Kong for her then 2-year-old son Gino thinking it had only 500 pieces. She will then finish around a thousand puzzles in the next 30 years which will form part of the museum's collection. Puzzles of various materials form the collection such as wood, cardboard and plastic puzzles. In terms of form the museum hosts flat, spherical, 3D and \\"4D\\" puzzles. The puzzles in the collection also features various genres and subjects such as people, nature, historical event, religious figures, fictional characters, cartoons, corporate ads, as well as reproduction of paintings by artists such as Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Vincent Van Gogh, Michelangelo, Leonardo Da Vinci, Salvador Dali, Claude Monet, Sandro Botticelli, Francisco Goya, Antoni Gaud√≠, Pablo Picasso, and Edgar Degas. Among the most difficult to accomplish puzzles for Gil-Lacuna was the 10,000 piece puzzle which featured Diego Vel√°zquez‚Äôs Las Hilanderas which took 300 hours over 7 months to finish due to most of the puzzle's pieces being solid black.

Barakat died on Monday, 19 Sha'ban 859 AH (4 August 1455), and it so happened that the Sultan's reply‚Äîdated 16 Rajab 859 AH ()‚Äîarrived from Egypt the following day, accompanied by a robe of investiture (khil'ah) for Sharif Muhammad. On 4 Shawwal () Muhammad received condolences from the Sultan and his formal decree of appointment (tawqi). In the year 878 AH (1473/1474) Sultan Qaitbay appointed Muhammad's son Barakat as co-regent. Sharif Muhammad died on 11 Muharram 903 AH () at Wadi Marr al-Zahran (present-day Wadi Fatimah). He was buried in the Cemetery of al-Ma'lah in Mecca, and a tomb was built over his grave. Issue He had sixteen sons, besides daughters.

It was divided into four wards: Marne (two councillors), Forster (one councillor), Sedan (three councillors) and Swan Reach (two councillors). In 1986, it covered an area district of 2300 square kilometres, described as \\"bounded by Keyneton, Swan Reach, Bowhill and Sanderston\\". The major service centres were Cambrai, Sedan and Swan Reach, with smaller townships at Black Hill, Bowhill, Keyneton, Nildottie and Purnong. It had a population of 1,740 in 1985, which had marginally declined since the 1960s. The main primary industries in the largely agricultural district were wheat and barley growing and sheep grazing, with irrigated crops along the Murray River, and tourism along the river being of increasing importance.

In November 2016 two regional councillors, former senator Antonio Fosson and Claudio Restano, left the Valdostan Union (UV) in disagreement with Augusto Rollandin, President of Aosta Valley, and launched the party. PNV was immediately admitted into the coalition supporting the regional government composed also of the Progressive Valdostan Union (UVP), Edelweiss (SA) and the Democratic Party (PD), while forming a strong partnership with the UVP and SA. In March 2017 PNV stopped supporting the government and, along with the UVP, SA and Autonomy Liberty Participation Ecology (ALPE), formed a new government without the UV, under President Pierluigi Marquis (SA), with Restano minister of Tourism, Sports, Commerce and Transports. In June 2017 the group of the PNV was enlarged to Carlo Norbiato, another dissident from the UV, and consequently changed name to Civic Area ‚Äì For Our Valley. In September a joint group with SA was formed: Civic Area ‚Äì Edelweiss ‚Äì For Our Valley. In October Marquis resigned and was replaced by Laurent Vi√©rin (UVP) at the head of a coalition composed of the UV, the UVP, the EPAV and the PD.

Investors in the company include HBO, Facebook co-founder Andrew McCollum, and Mark Cuban. The company and its service is named in honor for one of the pioneering engineers of television, Philo T. Farnsworth. , their OTT streaming television service has approximately 750,000 subscribers.  History  The company was originally founded in 2009 as Tivli by then Harvard seniors Nicholas Krasney and Tuan Ho. It began as an experiment using aluminium foil as a makeshift satellite dish in order to \\"pick up TV signals and deliver them wirelessly to their laptops via a jerry-rigged server\\". At its launch, the project was intended to be a way to circumvent the fact that Harvard did not provide cable TV service for its students. When the service was made available to others in 2011, half of the Harvard resident population registered for it within the first few weeks of the offer. In 2009, Tivli first incubated in Cambridge, Massachusetts, at the Harvard Innovation Lab (iLab) before moving to Harvard Square in 2013. After securing their Series B round, Philo moved again in 2015 to San Francisco, California. In July 2013, the venture raised a $6.3 million round led by Patrick Chung at venture capital firm New Enterprise Associates. Among the Series A investors, were Mark Cuban from Radical Investments LP, HBO, and Rho Ventures. The same year the company was rebranded as Philo, from its former name, Tivli. In June 2015, Philo raised $10 million in a Series B round led by New Enterprise Associates, with joint investment from HBO, Rho Ventures, Xfund, CBC New Media Group, as well as Andrew McCollum. McCollum, a founding member of Facebook, became CEO of the company in 2014. As of September 2015, the service was available in 42 universities. On November 14, 2017, Philo launched a new OTT streaming television service in the United States. The service is available via TVs, computers, tablets, and phones. The service includes channels from A&E; Networks, AMC Networks, Discovery and the legacy Viacom channels now owned by ViacomCBS. Those companies also became joint owners of the service with a combined $25 million investment before this launch. The service has no local or sports channels. While Philo does not have any of the major news channels, the service offers BBC World News, which is distributed by AMC, and financial news channel, Cheddar. In October 2018, Philo added Hallmark Channel and its sister channels Hallmark Movies & Mysteries and Hallmark Drama.Philo Adds Hallmark, Hallmark Drama, & Hallmark Movies & Mysteries ‚Äì The Stremable, 25 October 2018 In February 2020, Google Fiber announced it would only offer new customer options to sign up for streaming services.

The Broads is designated as a protected landscape with ‚Äòstatus equivalent to a national park‚Äô. The area is underlain by a suite of generally flat-lying sedimentary rock types of which the most recent are those of Neogene age. Almost entirely covered by more recent superficial deposits, they are exposed at the surface to a very limited extent or else are known from boreholes or quarry workings. Overlying these across much the larger part of the 'national park' are silts and clays of Flandrian age, which together with peat deposits form the broad flats of the Waveney, Yare, Bure and Thurne valleys. Extraction of the peat in historic times, and subsequent flooding of the workings, has resulted in the pattern of broads for which the area is widely known. Older subsurface rocks Borehole, seismic and other geophysical survey evidence suggest that the entire region is underlain at depth by rocks of Silurian age though these do not occur at or near the surface.Lee, J.R. et al. (eds) 2015 British Regional Geology: East Anglia 5th Edn. Keyworth, Nottingham BGS pp8-9 Much of this region of England is believed to have been emergent i.e. above sea level, during most of the succeeding Devonian period and through the Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic periods. Rocks of this age are therefore absent or restricted in occurrence in the region and are unknown beneath the Broads. Rocks of Jurassic age are known from other parts of East Anglia but again are not known to underlie the Broads.Lee, J.R. et al. (eds) 2015 British Regional Geology: East Anglia 5th Edn. Keyworth, Nottingham BGS pp28-32 Cretaceous In common with most of the rest of East Anglia, the ‚Äònational park‚Äô is underlain by Cretaceous age rocks of the Chalk Group, though these are in turn overlain by younger rocks across the larger part of the area. Only west of Wroxham and Hoveton in the Bure valley and west of Brundall in the Yare valley is chalk present immediately beneath superficial deposits. There are some very restricted outcrops of the Upper Chalk in the valley sides between Wroxham and Coltishall, some of which like those around Coltishall Hall have been worked.British Geological Survey 1999 ‚Äò‚ÄôMundesley and North Walsham‚Äô‚Äô England and Wales map sheet 132 & 148 Solid & Drift geology 1:50,000 Keyworth, Nottingham BGS The Upper Chalk also outcrops northwest of Bramerton and west from Postwick into Norwich on either side of the Yare valley.British Geological Survey 1991 ‚Äò‚ÄôGreat Yarmouth‚Äô‚Äô England and Wales map sheet 162 Quaternary & Pre-quaternary geology 1:50,000 Keyworth, Nottingham BGSInstitute of Geological Sciences 1975 ‚Äò‚ÄôNorwich‚Äô‚Äô England and Wales map sheet 161 Solid and Drift edition 1:50,000 Keyworth, Nottingham IGS Palaeogene A small outlier of the London Clay is known to exist beneath Langley and Hardley Marshes where a buried valley lies at depth beneath the shallow modern day valley of the Yare. This geological formation dates from the Lower Eocene epoch of the Palaeogene period. Neogene The youngest ‚Äòsolid‚Äô rocks of the area are those of the Crag Group which are of Neogene to early Quaternary age. They comprise marine and estuarine sands and other sediments. These and more recent superficial deposits (described below) are all recognised formally as parts of the Great Britain Superficial Deposits Supergroup. Quaternary During the early and middle Pleistocene, a major river now referred to as the Bytham River flowed from west to east through the area on the approximate line of the modern Waveney. It left a series of river terrace deposits, evident west of Geldeston for example, whose colours betray the origin of their materials in the English Midlands. Some of these sands and gravels have been worked in the past at places such as Kirby Cane, just outside the 'national park'.Lee, J.R. et al. (eds) 2015 British Regional Geology: East Anglia 5th Edn. Keyworth, Nottingham BGS pp133-137 Sediments associated with the Anglian glaciation are collectively termed the Albion Glacigenic Group, having formerly gone under other names. Amongst these the Lowestoft Formation (formerly known by various names: Lowestoft Boulder Clay, Cromer Till (in part), Lowestoft Till Group, Lowestoft Till Formation) comprises deposits of glacial origin along with the Aldeby sands and gravels. Likewise the Happisburgh Glacigenic Formation is a modern name for an assemblage of sediments including the former ‚ÄòCorton Formation‚Äô and a part of the Cromer Till. The tract of country around Lowestoft, Belton and Blundeston is formed by sands, along with sandy clays and gravels, formerly assigned to the Corton Formation. This is overlain in many places by the Corton Woods sands and gravels which are of glaciofluvial origin. The national park boundaries encompass the margins of this tract and hence of these sediments. The silts and clays of Flandrian age together with peat deposits forming the broad flats of the various river valleys are collectively assigned the name of the Breydon Formation.

The \\"socialism\\" in postsocialism is not based on a Marxist conception of socialism but rather, especially in the Eastern European context, on the idea of \\"actually existing socialism\\". Scholars of postsocialist states maintain that, even if the political and economic systems in place did not adhere to orthodox Marxist ideas of \\"socialism\\", these systems were real and had real effects on cultures, society, and individuals' subjectivities. Scholars of postsocialism often draw from other theoretical frameworks like postcolonialism and focus especially on the evolution of labor relations, gender roles, and ethnic and religious political affiliations. The idea of postsocialism has also been criticized, however, for placing so much emphasis on the impact of socialism while the term socialism remains difficult to define, especially if extended beyond Eastern Europe.See, e.g., Martin M√ºller, ‚ÄúGoodbye, Postsocialism!,‚Äù Europe-Asia Studies 71, no. 4 (April 21, 2019): 533‚Äì50, https://doi.org/10.1080/09668136.2019.1578337.  Overview  Postsocialism focuses on the lasting cultural and social effects of actually existing socialism, and how the legacies of socialism interact with the free-market or neoliberal policies of the 1990s. As an analytical framework, postsocialism emphasizes the importance of the socialist state and provides a critical perspective on the ‚ÄúWestern economic and political forms‚Äù that arose in its place. Although the terms postsocialist and postcommunist are mostly interchangeable, postcommunism focuses more on the institutional and formal changes, whereas postsocialism is generally more concerned with culture, subjectivities, and everyday life.M√ºller, \\"Goodbye Postsocialism!,\\" 338. Postsocialist scholars, like postcolonial theorists, are concerned with the tensions between Western scholarship, including their own, on the regions they study and the local scholarship. Postsocialist scholars have framed some of their studies in response to structural models projecting a ‚Äútransition‚Äù between a socialist state and a democratic market economy. Postsocialist scholars criticize these studies, known as ‚Äútransitology,‚Äù for being teleological, based excessively in Western ideas, and simplistic. Instead of \\"transition,\\" postsocialist scholars prefer to describe ‚Äútransformations‚Äù resulting from the end of socialism, avoiding the implicit endpoint contained in ‚Äútransition‚Äù and allowing for many different changes to happen simultaneously and in complementary or contradictory ways.M√ºller, 537; Verdery, What Was Socialism, 15, 227-228; Michael Burawoy and Katherine Verdery, ‚ÄúIntroduction,‚Äù in Uncertain Transition: Ethnographies of Change in the Postsocialist World, ed. Katherine Verdery and Michael Burawoy (Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 1999), 1‚Äì3. Some postsocialist scholars, like Katherine Verdery, posit that the turning point of 1989 should be considered a turning point not just for formerly socialist states but for the world more broadly, because the existence of these ‚Äúsocialist‚Äù states was central to geopolitics, global economics, and to the self-definition of non- socialist states as well.Verdery, What Was Socialism, 230.  Postsocialism and academic fields  = Postcolonialism = Like postsocialism, postcolonial theory provides a critical perspective on the cultural and social legacies of a hegemonic system, focuses on continuities through periods of structural political change, and critiques mainstream Western scholarship. Scholars of postsocialism such as Katherine Verdery, Sharad Chari, and Jill Owczarak, have all explored the potential overlaps between postsocialism and postcolonialism and the ways that these theories can inform one another. There are some key differences between postsocialism and postcolonialism. First, although influential thinkers like Frantz Fanon and Aim√© C√©saire wrote texts during the height of decolonization, postcolonial studies emerged as a field largely in the 1980s, while postsocialism emerged in the mid-1990s, only a few years after the fall of most communist states.Sharad Chari and Katherine Verdery, ‚ÄúThinking between the Posts: Postcolonialism, Postsocialism, and Ethnography after the Cold War,‚Äù Comparative Studies in Society and History 51, no. 1 (2009): 11. Owczarzak claims that postcolonialism has a clearer theoretical grounding while most studies of postsocialism are geographically unified because they focus on Eastern European states.Jill Owczarzak, ‚ÄúIntroduction: Postcolonial Studies and Postsocialism in Eastern Europe,‚Äù Focaal 2009, no. 53 (April 1, 2009): 2, https://doi.org/10.3167/fcl.2009.530101. Notably, Arif Dirlik had developed the concept of postsocialism in the context of Chinese studies prior to the fall of socialism in Eastern Europe, but did so based on a significantly different definition of postsocialism.Arif Dirlik, ‚ÄúPostsocialism? Reflections on ‚ÄòSocialism with Chinese Characteristics,‚Äô‚Äù Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars 21, no. 1 (March 1989): 33-44, https://doi.org/10.1080/14672715.1989.10413190. Verdery and Chari present three main ways of combining postsocialism and postcolonialism, or thinking ‚Äúbetween the posts.‚Äù First, postsocialism and postcolonialism can be used to explore the relationship between ‚Äúempire and capital,‚Äù especially by drawing from studies of the ‚Äútechnologies of imperial power,\\" studies of the relationship between empire and ethnic or nationalistic sentiment, and studies of neocolonialism and neoliberalism that explore ‚Äúnew kinds political and economic interventions into the affairs of formally sovereign states.\\"Chari and Verdery, \\"Thinking between the Posts,\\" 15, 13, 17. Second, postsocialism and postcolonialism can be combined to undo the Cold War-era tendencies for studies of the ‚ÄúThree Worlds‚Äù to treat each \\"world\\" in isolation and rely on different fields for analyzing each one. And third, postsocialism can draw upon postcolonial theories of race to analyze the promotion of ‚Äúinternal enemies‚Äù under socialism and the development of ethnonationalism in Eastern Europe. Verdery and Chari propose a unified perspective, ‚Äúpost-Cold War studies,‚Äù that takes into account the impact of the Cold War on both the decolonization process and the progression and fall of socialism in Eastern Europe.Chari and Verdery, \\"Thinking between the Posts,\\" 18-26. Owczarak focuses on two themes of postcolonialism that scholars use in analyzing postsocialism. First, scholars can draw on Edward Said‚Äôs concept of Orientalism, as Eastern Europe has long ‚Äúserved as Western Europe‚Äôs intermediary ‚ÄòOther‚Äô‚Äù and has been perceived as relatively backward and in need of civilizing or educating.Owczarzak, ‚ÄúIntroduction,\\" 4-5. Second, postsocialist scholars can use the postcolonial concept of ‚Äúhybridity,‚Äù or ‚Äúbelonging to multiple worlds‚Äù to explore the ways in which Eastern European states are both ‚ÄúEastern‚Äù and ‚ÄúWestern.‚ÄùOwczarzak, ‚ÄúIntroduction,\\" 10-11. These analytical tools can help scholars take into account how analyses of and identities in Eastern Europe are formed with reference to both Western European and local concerns.Owczarzak, ‚ÄúIntroduction,\\" 12-13. = Postsocialism and gender = Issues relating to gender, especially that of abortion, have become major political flashpoints in postsocialist states and gender is a major focus of postsocialist studies. Many postsocialist states have powerful conservative, natalist, anti-feminist political movements. Postsocialist scholars explain these developments as being to some extent a backlash against what many perceived as the ‚Äúfeminizing,‚Äù or ‚Äúmothering‚Äù nature of the socialist state, which provided a great deal of services for the family and became associated with the term ‚Äúfeminism‚Äù itself.Verdery, What Was Socialism, 80-81; Owczarzak, ‚ÄúIntroduction,\\" 8-9. The developments under postsocialism, then, involve ‚Äúcompelling women back into the nurturing and care-giving roles ‚Äònatural‚Äô to their sex and restoring to men their ‚Äònatural‚Äô family authority.‚ÄùVerdery, What Was Socialism, 80. The retreat of the state from the public domain‚Äîin terms of reproductive rights, guaranteed employment, and social care‚Äîalso led to a loss of work and engagement in civil society for women, in what Frances Pine similarly calls a ‚Äúretreat to the domestic.‚ÄùFrances Pine, ‚ÄúRetreat to the Household? Gendered Domains in Postsocialist Poland,‚Äù in Postsocialism: Ideals, Ideologies and Practices in Eurasia, ed. C. M. Hann (London: Routledge, 2001), 101. Scholars of postsocialism have also analyzed the interaction between different visions of feminism. Analysis from Western feminists and aid from Western feminist NGOs has met with some resistance from Eastern European feminists who embrace ideas of femininity and gender difference and criticized Western observers for not understanding local gender dynamics.Owczarzak, \\"Introduction,\\" 8-9; Manduhai Buyandelgeriyn, ‚ÄúPost-Post-Transition Theories: Walking on Multiple Paths,‚Äù Annual Review of Anthropology 37, no. 1 (2008): 241, https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085214. At the same time, some younger Eastern European feminists have turned to Western institutions and ideas for inspiration, support, or legitimation, adding a generational tension to gender issues in the region.Owczarzak, \\"Introduction,\\" 9. = Postsocialism and China = Although the nominally socialist Chinese Communist Party is still in power, the Reform and Opening policies and concomitant changes to China's economy and society have led some scholars to use the label postsocialist to describe China as well. Arif Dirlik first used this term in 1989 in an attempt to theorize the ‚Äúcondition of ideological contradiction and uncertainty‚Äù present in a state that continued to call itself socialist (with the term ‚Äúsocialism with Chinese characteristics‚Äù) while undertaking capitalist economic reforms.Arif Dirlik, ‚ÄúPostsocialism?,\\" 34. Dirlik argues that reform in China created a tension between the Communist Party‚Äôs continued self-definition as socialist and its use of ‚Äúsocialist revolution‚Äù in fostering nationalism, and the internal and external pressures from integration with the capitalist world economy. For Dirlik, postsocialism is a way of describing the ‚Äúdiscursive struggle between present-day capitalism and ‚Äòactually existing socialism‚Äô to appropriate the future.‚ÄùDirlik, \\"Postsocialism?\\" 43. Dirlik‚Äôs conception of postsocialism also rejects the idea of a linear transition from socialism to capitalist market economics, but, unlike the later Eastern Europe-focused scholarship of postsocialism, Dirlik‚Äôs theory is focused on political and economic visions rather than culture and everyday life. Thus Dirlik‚Äôs theory is not meant to shift studies on China in a particular direction permanently, but rather to step away from definitive labels and ‚Äúrethink socialism‚Äù and its tensions with and ties to capitalism.Dirlik, \\"Postsocialism?\\" 44. In 1994, Paul Pickowicz proposed a different understanding of postsocialism in China based on film and culture, looking from the ‚Äúbottom up‚Äù rather than top down.Paul G. Pickowicz, ‚ÄúHuang Jianxin and the Notion of Postsocialism,‚Äù in New Chinese Cinemas: Forms, Identities, Politics, ed. Nick Browne et al. (Cambridge University Press, 1994), https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139174121.005, 275. Analyzing the 1980s films of director Huang Jianxin, Pickowicz argues for a postsocialist ‚Äúidentity‚Äù and ‚Äúcultural condition‚Äù that is shared across China and formerly socialist states in Eastern Europe, consisting mainly of a ‚Äúnegative, dystopian‚Äù view of society and a sense of ‚Äúprofound disillusionment,‚Äù ‚Äúhopelessness,‚Äù ‚Äúalienation,‚Äù and a lack of a positive vision or hope for change.Pickowicz, \\"Huang Jianxin and the Notion of Postsocialism,\\" 275-6, 278. Like scholars of Eastern European postsocialism, Pickowicz focuses on the experience of socialism as reflected through culture, but Pickowicz‚Äôs postsocialism has an added dimension: because the Chinese Communist Party is still in charge, postsocialist artworks ‚Äú‚Äòsubvert‚Äô ‚Ä¶ the oppressive traditional socialist system by deconstructing the mythology of Chinese socialism.‚ÄùPickowicz, \\"Huang Jianxin and the Notion of Postsocialism,\\" 295. Since the emergence of postsocialist studies relating to Eastern Europe, some scholars of China have adapted these studies to China. Kevin Latham, following scholars such as Verdery, argues for describing China during the Reform Era as ‚Äúpostsocialist‚Äù rather than a ‚Äúhybrid version of socialism‚Äù because postsocialist studies highlight both the ‚Äúradical breaks and the continuities that exist alongside each other and mutually inform one another.‚ÄùKevin Latham, ‚ÄúRethinking Chinese Consumption: Social Palliatives and the Rhetorics of Transition in Postsocialist China,‚Äù in Postsocialism: Ideals, Ideologies and Practices in Eurasia, ed. C. M. Hann (London: Routledge, 2001), 218‚Äì219. Latham also follows Dirlik, however, in defining postsocialism as not signifying a ‚Äústraightforward ‚Äòafter‚Äô in either logical or chronological terms,‚Äù meaning that postsocialist China is not just defined by transformations from the earlier era but also by institutions and sensibilities that remained the same.Latham, \\"Rethinking Chinese Consumption,\\" 219. Latham also argues that although ‚Äútransitology‚Äù or a focus on China‚Äôs ‚Äútransition‚Äù to capitalism is an inappropriate frame of analysis, it is also important that ‚Äúthe notion of transition in the local rhetoric plays an important role in maintaining Party legitimacy.‚ÄùLatham, \\"Rethinking Chinese Consumption,\\" 230. In the 1990s, according to Latham, the Communist Party used deliberately vague ideas of ‚Äútransition‚Äù to elicit support for continued reform. The people could persevere through the various problems created by Reform if something better was at the other end.Latham, \\"Rethinking Chinese Consumption,\\" 231.  Criticism  A basic criticism of postsocialism, generally acknowledged by its proponents, is that as the ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù from postsocialism gets further away, postsocialist analysis risks ignoring or misunderstanding newer developments. As anthropologist Caroline Humphrey notes, postsocialism is also open to the criticism that it removes agency from local actors by ‚Äú[implying] constraints on the freedom of people in these countries to determine their own futures.‚ÄùCaroline Humphrey, ‚ÄúDoes the Category ‚ÄòPostsocialist‚Äô Still Make Sense?,‚Äù in Postsocialism: Ideals, Ideologies and Practices in Eurasia, ed. C. M. Hann (London: Routledge, 2001), 13. Nevertheless, Humphrey supports continued use of the term because ‚Äúactually existing socialism‚Äù was ‚Äúdeeply pervasive‚Äù and ‚Äúhad a certain foundational unity‚Äù and its influence persists and remains inadequately understood.Humphrey, ‚ÄúDoes the Category ‚ÄòPostsocialist‚Äô Still Make Sense?,‚Äù 13. Political scientist Jordan Gans-Morse has criticized postsocialist scholars (he uses the term ‚Äúpostcommunist,‚Äù but refers to both) for exaggerating the prevalence of teleological narratives of Eastern European political and economic development, and for conflating ‚Äútransitology‚Äù and ‚Äúmodernization theory‚Äù when the two were distinct.Jordan Gans-Morse, ‚ÄúSearching for Transitologists: Contemporary Theories of Post-Communist Transitions and the Myth of a Dominant Paradigm,‚Äù Post-Soviet Affairs 20, no. 4 (January 2004): 321-323, https://doi.org/10.2747/1060-586X.20.4.320. Gans- Morse acknowledges some of the criticisms from postsocialist scholars but argues that theories of ‚Äúideal-type sequences of transition‚Äù do not actually predict or prescribe a certain endpoint but allow scholars to analyze how and why a state has deviated from the model, a form of analysis that might be preferable to open-ended ‚Äútransformations.‚ÄùGans-Morse, \\"Searching for Transitologists,\\" 339. Gans-Morse also argues that alternative theories of change in these states can be used as points of comparison, such as ‚Äúrevolution, institutional collapse followed by state (re)building, or decolonization.‚ÄùGans-Morse, \\"Searching for Transitologists,\\" 341. Gans-Morse‚Äôs criticism, notably, is aimed at building a better understanding of these states for the field of ‚Äúcomparative politics,‚Äù a field more inclined toward the kind of ideal-type modeling he defends than anthropology, the field of many postsocialist scholars.Gans-Morse, \\"Searching for Transitologists,\\" 343. Political scientist David Ost, while not criticizing the notion of postsocialism itself (he uses the term ‚Äúpostcommunism‚Äù throughout his text), has argued based on his study of unions that ‚Äúpostcommunism is over‚Äù and the ‚Äúglobal economy is here.‚ÄùDavid Ost, ‚ÄúThe Consequences of Postcommunism: Trade Unions in Eastern Europe‚Äôs Future,‚Äù East European Politics and Societies: And Cultures 23, no. 1 (February 2009): 13, https://doi.org/10.1177/0888325408326791. Ost argues that unions under postsocialism were ‚Äú‚Äòproducerists‚Äô par excellence,‚Äù interested in protecting the interests of skilled workers, trimming the workforce of unskilled or underused (often female) labor, and believing that the market would value and reward their skilled work.Ost, \\"The Consequences of Postcommunism,\\" 30. The sign that postsocialism ended, to Ost, is that unions returned to being class- based, with many of the postsocialist transformations complete and a new generation of union leaders came of age in the era of ‚Äúactually existing capitalism‚Äù and its exploitation of labor.Ost, ‚ÄúThe Consequences of Postcommunism,‚Äù 20-23. Ost projects the emergence of a ‚Äúdivided labor movement‚Äù in the shadow now of postsocialism, with skilled labor unions more successful at defending their class interests and other unions struggling.Ost, ‚ÄúThe Consequences of Postcommunism,‚Äù 30. Thus, for Ost, the region of Eastern Europe still requires its own frame of analysis, but this frame of analysis should focus on the legacy of postsocialism, not socialism, because the structural transformation from state socialism to a capitalist market economy was complete and the effects of that transformation were now shaping the labor movement. Martin M√ºller has more recently mounted a theoretical critique of postsocialism, arguing that postsocialism is not only marginal in social and cultural theory but it has ‚Äúlost its object,‚Äù in that socialism is not as important to contemporary developments, and it has ‚Äúproblematic conceptual and political implications.‚ÄùM√ºller, \\"Goodbye Postsocialism!,\\" 534, 539. M√ºller critiques postsocialism specifically on five points. First, postsocialism refers to a ‚Äúdisappearing object,‚Äù and is decreasingly useful at analyzing new developments. Second, postsocialism ‚Äúprivileges rupture,‚Äù centering itself on the fall of socialism and thus emphasizing breakage over continuity and creating a unity among ‚Äúsocialisms‚Äù that did not necessarily exist.M√ºller, \\"Goodbye Postsocialism!,\\" 534, 540-541. Third, postsocialism is overly attached to Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and it is limited by not taking into account ‚Äúa relational, deterritorialized view of space‚Äù appropriate to a globalizing world.M√ºller, \\"Goodbye Postsocialism!,\\" 541-542. Fourth, postsocialism is ‚ÄúOrientalizing,‚Äù in that it ‚Äúreflects specifically Western discourses, approaches, and knowledge claims‚Äù and fails to live up to its injunction to listen to ‚Äúnative‚Äù scholars and theories.M√ºller, \\"Goodbye Postsocialism!,\\" 542-544. Fifth, postsocialism ‚Äúrisks becoming politically disempowering‚Äù by suggesting that socialism is ‚Äúover and done with‚Äù and foreclosing the possibility of a new, non-Marxist- Leninist variant.M√ºller, \\"Goodbye Postsocialism!,\\" 544-545.

Wesseler KG, stopped the tractor production and specialised in selling and repairing Fiatagri tractors until they registered as insolvent in 1988.  History  = Beginning ‚Äì Monetary reform = In 1879, Bernhard Wesseler from Darup purchased a building with surrounding land in the heath of K√ºmper near Altenberge. He became a farmer and opened a smithy. It was expanded for the first time in 1909. Wesselers son Heinrich joined the company in 1911 or 1912This remains unclear. Some sources claim 1911, (Landwirtschaftliches Wochenblatt Westfalen/Lippe No. 33. 16 August 1990. Page 33), (Franz Sundorf: Wesseler-Chronik. 2016. Page 60), while others claim 1912. (1936 Schlepperbau begonnen ‚Äì in Westf√§lische Nachrichten, 1966; page 1), (100 Jahre Wesseler Landtechnik, 1979; page 86) and started repairing and selling agricultural machines.1936 Schlepperbau begonnen ‚Äì in Westf√§lische Nachrichten, 1966 Until 1936, the company Schmitz was the most important competitor. In the same year, Wesseler bought all the agricultural machine parts from Schmitz; Schmitz focused on manufacturing trailers since then. 12 employees worked for Wesseler in 1936, the first tractor prototype was built in the same year. It had a ladder frame and a hopper-cooled engine. This prototype was improved and Wesseler showed it to the public in 1938. No more than 20 tractors of this type were produced until 1940.Wesseler: Schlepper aus Altenberge ‚Äì in Landwirtschaftliches Wochenblatt Westfalen/Lippe No. 33. 16 August 1990. Page 33 Today, no pre-war Wesseler tractors exist anymore. Before the Second World War, Wesseler was still a company specialised in smithy tasks rather than a tractor manufacturer, so that a new forge was built in 1939. During the Second World War, some Wesseler employees were conscripted, the tractor production was halted. Wesseler also used forced labour, two polish workers had to work in the plant. In the early war years, the company mainly repaired bicycles. Caused by the war, neither fuel nor production material was available, so that old military trucks and wood gas motors had to be used to produce new tractors in the first post war years. The regular tractor production using the frameless block construction method began after the monetary reform in West Germany in 1948. At this time, Wesseler had 10 employees. = Economical upswing during the tractor demand period = The economical upswing of Wesseler began with the monetary reform. Wesseler gained profit from the huge tractor demand in Germany in the 1950s. The sons of Heinrich Wesseler, Ludger and Paul already worked for the company back then. At first it was planned to turn Wesseler into a Fahr dealer, due to Fahr supply problems, Wesseler also sold tractors of other brands such as Normag and Schl√ºter. Wesseler also sold their own tractors. Later, Wesseler became an important Claas dealer and focused on producing their own tractors. In 1952, a tractor workshop was built, it was increased in size in 1959. However, Wesseler still manufactured other goods suchs as tableware. A BP petrol station was a part of the Wesseler plant. An important occurrence was the DLG- show 1949 in Frankfurt, where the first MWM diesel engine was bought. Before the tractors were fitted with MWM engines, Wesseler used Deutz engines, which had a bad durability due to bad lubrication oil quality. MWM engines could also use the bad lubrication oil, they became the standard diesel engines of Wesseler tractors; starting in 1953, Wesseler offered every tractor type with a water-cooled and an air-cooled MWM engine of the same power output. Prometheus gearboxes were used first, later, Wesseler switched to ZF gearboxes. Those used to be progressive in the 1950s as well as the direct injection MWM diesel engines. Soon, Wesseler became an exhibitor at several fairs in Germany. A Wesseler dealer network was established, the main distribution areas were the regions around M√ºnster in Westfalen and Oldenburg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. For the Dutch market, Wesseler tractors got an orange painting and the brand name Feldmeister. Primarily, 20 PS tractors were sold in the Netherlands. 800 Feldmeister were sold until 1967. The Belgian market demanded more powerful tractors. In the viniculture regions Eifel and Mosel some one-cylinder narrow gauge models with up to 15 PS were sold, some tractors even made it to Hesse and France. = Zenith and fall = In 1958, Wesseler had 60 employees which worked in a two-shift-system. This number soon reached 80 and in 1960, Wesseler had 120 employees. Most employees were from Altenberge and the surrounding areas, some also came from the Netherlands and Belgium. In the early 1950s, some employees built houses next to the Wesseler plant, Wesseler themselves also built houses there for their employees in 1962. When Wesseler was at the economical zenith in the second half of the 1950s, one tractor left the plant per day. At first, Wesseler kept up with trends such as the equipment carrier tractor but they did not invest in new production machines for the plant. This led to an expensive production which could not compete with the inexpensive production of other tractor manufacturers. Wessler had to register as insolvent, the production was stopped in 1966 when Wesseler had 70 employees. The last tractor, a WL 222 was sold in June 1967. During three decades, 3600 tractors had been produced which makes Wesseler the fourth-largest tractor manufacturer of NRW. Before the registration of insolvency, Wesseler already tried to change the concept of the company in late 1965. Paul Wesseler wanted to stop the tractor production and form Wesseler into a Fiat dealer. This happened in 1967 when Wesseler became the H. Wesseler KG.2000 Fiatagri Traktoren verkauft ‚Äì in Eilbote, 22/1987. 28 May 1987. The company soon became important for the region again as a Fiat dealer, a new tractor workshop was built in 1973 and expanded in 1982. Wesseler was the second-largest Fiat dealer in Germany. At the end of the 1980s, Wesseler had to face major problems: A huge and expensive spares store and too many employees. In February 1988 Wesseler had to register als insolvent again. So far, 2000 Fiat tractors had been sold. After the suspension of the insolvency proceedings, a newly founded agricultural machine company rented the Wesseler plant in 1995.Agrartechnik Altenberge ‚Äì Unternehmensentwicklung It moved to a new building in 2003. Since 2004, the tractor museum of Altenberge rents the Wesseler plant, which is an LWL memorial since 2010.  Distribution  = Brand names = In Germany, Wesseler tractors were sold as Wessler and Wesseler Ackermeister. In the Netherlands and Belgium, mainly the brand name Feldmeister was used, about 800 Feldmeister were sold. In Belgium the brand names Ackermeister and Wesseler- Benz were used as well. In the Netherlands, the brand names Vewema and Westfalia were also used. The name depended on the local Wesseler importer. = Wesseler dealers = In Germany, Wesseler tractors were sold for DM 5.000 up to DM 10.000, depending on the model and power of the tractor. Wesseler had a branch office in Saerbeck since 1966. Some of the external Wesseler traders were these: *Hausberger in Trier / GermanySundorf, p. 77 *Wirtz in Gangelt / GermanySundorf, p. 78 *Weitz in Linnich / Germany *Goudland Tractorploegenfabriek in Echt / NetherlandsSundorf, p. 79 *Roefs‚Äô Machinenhandel in Venlo / Netherlands, brand name WestfaliaSundorf, p. 81 *Vewema N.V. in Gorinchem / Netherlands, brand name Vewema *Etienne Decaupere Landbouwmachienenfabrik in Lichtervelde / Belgium, brand name Feldmeister and Wesseler, until 1954Sundorf, p. 83 *Vanderpere in Lichtervelde / Belgium, brand name Wesseler-Benz, since 1954Sundorf, p. 80 *Gebr.

This system was kept until the mid-1950s. Wesseler bought engines and gearboxes from other companies, while the rest of the tractor parts such as axles, bearings, hydraulics, hoods, wings and fuel tanks were produced in the Wesseler plant. The customers had to order the tractors first before they were produced, later, customers could purchase already produced tractors. Wesseler tractors had many standard fittings such as starter motors and lead-acid batteries, the customers could also order a lot of extra accessories like front loaders, three-point linkages, roofs and foldable headlights. The Dutch Wessler dealer C. C. V. Landbouwbelang G.A on the other hand ordered tractors without lead-acid batteries. Tractors with rated power outputs of up to were produced. Wesseler never used mass production, also neither plans nor mechanical drawings were used to build the tractors. No applies for patents were made. Today, around 300 Wesseler are registered as street-legal vehicles in Germany.Akademische Abschlussarbeit ‚Äì m√∂gliches Thema  Tractor types  Wesseler, production year 1964 WL 24, 1955 Wesseler WL 12 The type namings were made depending on the PS-numberIn Germany, PS was used as the unit for power in until the 1970s. It is an abbreviation for Pferdest√§rke, which means horsepower. However, 1 PS does not equal 1 hp as the definitions are different. as described above first. Starting in 1953, a W was put into the type name for Wesseler wassergek√ºhlt (water-cooled). Air-cooled models were given the letters WL for Wesseler luftgek√ºhlt (air-cooled). Equipment carrier tractors got the type code WLG for Wesseler luftgek√ºhlt Ger√§tetr√§gerA Ger√§tetr√§ger, literal translation: Equipment carrier, is a special kind of tractor that has a frame. This makes it possible to attach devices underneath or on top of the tractor. (air-cooled equipment carrier), narrow gauge models have the name WLS Wesseler luftgek√ºhlt schmalspur (air-cooled narrow gauge). The PS-number followed the letters. Some extra letters were used to mark extras: H was used for Hochradschlepper;A Hochradschlepper, literal translation: High wheel tractor, is a special kind of tractor that has wheels with a large diameter. This gives the tractor a good ground clearance. this means that the diameter of the wheels is larger than the diameter of standard wheels. L marks long wheelbase models, E stands for Extra version. Some models have a three-digit PS-number. In this case, the first digit reflects the cylinder amount of the engine while the last two digits resemble the power output of the engine. This three-digit system was used for later models with newer engines. ;Example of the Wesseler tractors types *W 12 (water-cooled, 12 PS) *W 12 E (water-cooled, 12 PS, extra version) *W 12 H (water-cooled, 12 PS, large wheel diameter version) *WL 12 (air-cooled, 12 PS) *WLG 12 (air-cooled equipment carrier tractor, 12 PS) *WLS 12 (air-cooled narrow gauge tractor, 12 PS)  Paintwork  Paintwork of a Wesseler Until 1953, Wesseler tractors sold under the Wesseler brand had a blue-grey painting with red rims and decorative stripes. Starting in 1954, a leaf-green painting was used, the red rim and decorative stripes colour was kept. Vewema tractors were painted in gentian blue, Feldmeister had an orange painting.Wesseler-Schlepper-Farben Wesseler used nitrocellulose lacquers.Holthaus: ‚Ä≥(...) und wenn man nach Hause kam, musste man sich erstmal duschen, wenns noch ging nat√ºrlich, wir hatten wohl ne M√ºtze auf, aber die Farbe war ja nicht so wie heute, heute ist das alles wasserverd√ºnnte Farbe, ne?

Early life and education Ou was born in Taiwan before moving to Canada at a young age; growing up in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia and the United States. He studied International Politics and Hebrew in Jerusalem as well as Arabic later on. While studying as a teenager, Ou began covering major news stories as a freelance photographer for the Associated Press and Reuters news-wires in Israel including the 2006 Israel‚ÄìHezbollah War and the fall of the Islamic Courts in Mogadishu, Somalia. He subsequently interned for the New York Times as a student. Although not formally educated as a photojournalist, Ou favored journalism as he believed there was a disconnect between academic study of the history of politics and conflict in the Middle East, and capturing on-the- ground personal stories resulting from the political decisions being made in the region at the time. Career In 2014, he was awarded an Emergency Fund Grant from the Magnum Foundation for his photograph \\"North\\". On October 1, 2016, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers detained and questioned Ou for more six hours in the Vancouver International Airport on his way to cover the Dakota Access Pipeline protests for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) as part of a project on Native American healthcare in North America. Ou's intended destination was Bismarck, North Dakota but, after passing through the initial security line at the airport, he was flagged by custom agents for secondary screening and pulled aside. They questioned his purpose for traveling to the United States and when he last visited Iraq, a routine experience for him as a journalist reporting in dangerous regions. He explained that he was on assignment as a photographer to cover the pipeline protests at Standing Rock for the CBC and that he had not been to Iraq in more than a year. He was then detained in a room where he was asked to provide details of his trips to every country he had visited in the last five years and all extremist groups he had come in contact with. Officials then requested that he unlock his three encrypted cell phones to search for images of him \\"posing with a dead body\\". After he refused to comply to protect his sources, they denied him entry into the United States, confiscated his phones and other materials, searched his checked baggage, and made photocopies of his reporter's notebook and personal diaries against his wishes. When his phones were returned to him, there was evidence of tampering with the SIM cards suggesting that copies of them may have been made. A border official later stated that his name matched a \\"person of interest\\" on an unspecified U.S. federal law enforcement watch list, however, no official reason was provided for his detention aside from it being \\"classified\\". Ou's travel rights into the United States have been revoked.

Some of the towns most impacted were Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, both near Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The fires claimed at least 14 lives, injured 190, and is one of the largest natural disasters in the history of Tennessee. By December 12, the fires had burned more than 10,000 acres (15 square miles) inside the national park, and 6,000 acres in other parts of the area. At least 14,000 area residents and tourists were forced to evacuate, while over 2,000 buildings were damaged and/or destroyed. One of the largest wildfires was the Chimney Tops 2 Fire, which burned more than 10,000 acres, and closed the Chimney Tops Trail. The Great Smoky Mountains wildfires were the deadliest wildfires in the eastern U.S. since the Great Fires of 1947, which killed 16 people in Maine. In addition, the fires were also the most deadly and destructive of the 2016 Southeastern United States wildfires. American country singer and notable figure of the area Dolly Parton was among many notable figures to pitch in to help the cause.  Progression United States Drought Monitor image from November 22, 2016 showing exceptional drought across the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee and southwest North Carolina. Chimney Tops, seen about 6 months after the fires with visible burn scars. The Chimney Tops 2 Fire was originally reported on November 23, 2016. No suppression activities were initiated and on November 24, 2016 park fire officials delineated containment boundary made of natural features which were hoped to contain the fire. On November 27, while the fire was still inside the containment boundary, three Chinook helicopters dumped water on the fire in an effort to mitigate its spread. Humidity values for this day dropped to as low as 17 percent during a period of \\"Exceptional\\" drought. A National Weather Service report issued on Sunday predicted wind gusts up to 40 mph the following day. On November 28, park employees observed that the fire had spread to the Chimneys Picnic Area north of and outside the containment boundary. Shortly thereafter fire was reported some distance further to the North in the park behind a residential area known as Mynatt Park. Throughout the afternoon and evening of November 28, numerous fires developed in the Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge areas as a result of wind-driven sparks or downed power lines. Strong southerly winds (with wind gusts up to 87 mph) created by mountain waves blew sparks into the Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge areas and knocked down trees (which in turn started fires when they hit power lines). A separate named fire destroyed much of the Cobbly Nob subdivision east of Gatlinburg. Because of power outages to some pumping stations on November 28 and because other pumping stations burned, hydrants quickly went dry on November 28, and Gatlinburg Fire Chief Greg Miller first asked for help from all of Sevier County and later from the entire state. Damage from the fires also prevented firefighters from communicating with each other through cell phones as the radio system became overloaded. Gatlinburg's emergency operations center phone system went down when it lost power. Even the 911 system could not handle all the calls it received, and calls intended for Sevier County went to Putnam County instead.  Investigation and arrests  Two unnamed juveniles were initially charged with aggravated arson in connection to the fires; however, charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence as well as language in an agreement between the State of Tennessee and the Department of the Interior which excluded state jurisdiction from prosecuting criminal activities that occurred entirely within the park. Throughout the course of the investigation which revealed that many of the area fires were likely caused by downed power lines, local officials declined to release any information about the fires or response, citing an erroneous interpretation of a gag order. Reactions Then President-elect Donald Trump tweeted: \\"My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires. Stay safe!\\" Governor Bill Haslam viewed the fires from above, and said it was \\"a little numbing\\" to see the extent of the damage. Noting that the region is a \\"special place\\" in Tennessee, he said \\"millions of families have come here and will continue to come here.\\" Commenting on the devastation, country music star Dolly Parton (originally from Sevierville) said she was \\"heartbroken\\". Her theme park, Dollywood (in Pigeon Forge), was largely spared from damage. Telethons A telethon, benefiting fire victims, was held December 9, in Nashville. The event featured country music artists such as Kenny Chesney, Brad Paisley, John Rich, John Oates, and Kristian Bush, and Dolly Parton. $9 million were raised. Parton hosted another telethon Tuesday, December 13, also in Nashville. All of the proceeds raised went to help those who lost their homes in the wildfires.  Aftermath  Soon after the fires were contained, Gatlinburg Mayor Mike Warner implored vacationers \\"If you really want to do something for Gatlinburg, come back and visit us.\\" Stefanie Benjamin, Associate Professor of Hospitality and Tourism at the University of Tennessee noted that despite negative press from the fire, the region \\"was able to recuperate fairly quickly.\\" On May 24, 2018, a federal lawsuit was filed against the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on behalf of victims seeking damages for the failure to stop the Chimney Tops 2 fire before it left the park. U.S. District Judge Ronnie Greer ruled September 8, 2020 that the National Park Service failed in its efforts to warn people in the area about the fires, meaning the park service can be held financially responsible and making a jury trial possible.

Critical Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics alike. G. Ragesh of Manorama Online gave it a rating of 3/5. \\"While both Manju and Amala go for matured performances as expected from them, it is Shane who steals the show. The film has an interesting plot but the sequences hinder its flow at times. It offers funny moments but comic scenes are not as promising as they were meant to be.\\"http://english.manoramaonline.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/saira-banu- movie-review-manju-warrier-amala-shane-nigam.html Deepa Soman of Times of India also gave it a rating of 3/5.\\"Amala Akkineni impresses by mouthing some lengthy Malayalam dialogues, that too in the scenes of court room proceedings. Manju Warrier, who was often termed in her first innings as one of the few actresses in Malayalam who can handle humour with ease, hasn't succeeded in regaining her comedy skills yet after the comeback. Most of her attempts at humour fizzle out, but she pulls off the emotional scenes of the film with aplomb. Shane Nigam is the right fit to play Joshua, but one wonders why his expressions are quite limited and uniform ‚Äì whether angry, sad or indifferent. The film's music by Mejjo Joseph accentuates the scenes quite a bit and is impressive.\\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movie- reviews/c/o-sairabanu/movie-review/57687567.cms Manok Kumar.R of Indian Express gave a rating of 2.5 out of 5. \\"Director Antony Sony's debut film packs some neat performances and enough surprises to keep the audience hooked to the story. Manju walks away with the film with her charming performance. Shane is convincing as an innocent teenager but it seems like he has one fixed look on his face for all the situations. Amala, who has made her comeback in Malayalam after a gap of more than 20 years, has also delivered a convincing performance as a formidable lawyer with ethical issues. Biju Sopanam deserves a special mention for his performance as an underconfident lawyer with a good heart. \\"http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/co-saira-banu-movie- review-you-wont-regret-watching-this-manju-warrier-film-4574374/ Accolades ;Asiavision Awards 2017 *Best Actress - Manju Warrier (shared with Udaharanam Sujatha) ;Yuva Awards 2017 *Outstanding Personality - Manju Warrier ;Asianet Comedy Awards *Best Actress - Manju Warrier (shared with Udaharanam Sujatha) - Nominated References External links * 2017 films Indian films 2010s Malayalam-language films Indian legal films Indian drama films 2010s legal drama films 2017 drama films ","title":"C/O Saira Banu"},{"id":"52469804","text":"Trachystola scabripennis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It is highly noted for the long circular tunnel that carries water from Erattayar dam near Kattappana to Idukki reservoir.  Etymology  The name Anchuruli literally means 'five vessels'. It is associated with the five small hills which are in the shape of inverted vessels and are visible when the water level in Idukki reservoir reduces.  Location  Idukki reservoir as seen from Anchuruli tunnel The elevation of Anchuruli ranges from above mean sea level. It lies in the Kanchiyar grama panchayath in the newly formed Idukki constituency. The place can be accessed from Kanchiyar (3 km) which is on the Kattappana - Kuttikkanam state highway (SH-59).  Proposals for tourism development  View of Idukki reservoir during summer from Anchuruli Anchuruli at present is on the eve of a major tourism development which would be fulfilled soon. The panchayath is planning several strategies for the upliftment of Anchuruli into a major tourist destination in the district by combining the nearby Ayyappancoil village, which holds an ancient Sastha shrine and a hanging (suspension) bridge. Several proposals are also made regarding the boat service to Cheruthoni through the Idukki reservoir. If the proposals became fruitful, the journey to Cheruthoni will take only 20 minutes and it would be a great relief to the locals who have to travel about 30 km distance by road.  Feature films  The climax scene of 2014 Malayalam movie Iyobinte Pusthakam was shot in Anchuruli tunnel. Sequences of movies like Lord Livingstone 7000 Kandi, Maramkothi and Raksha were shot here.

The wall behind the statue is inscribed with Orwell's words \\"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear\\", from an unused preface to Animal Farm. The head of BBC history, Robert Seatter, said of Orwell and the statue that \\"He reputedly based his notorious Room 101 from Nineteen Eighty-Four on a room he had worked in whilst at the BBC, but here he will stand in the fresh air reminding people of the value of journalism in holding authority to account\\". Creation The statue was funded by a trust established by the Labour MP Ben Whitaker, with all funds coming from private donors. Notable donors to the trust included Ian McEwan, Andrew Marr, Ken Follett, Rowan Atkinson, Neil and Glenys Kinnock, Tom Stoppard, David Hare and Michael Frayn. In 2012 the BBC had rejected the offer of the statue, reportedly due to the opposition of the then Director-General, Mark Thompson. The project was revived under the current director-general, Tony Hall. Whitaker died in 2014 and the project was continued by his wife, Janet Whitaker, Baroness Whitaker. Jennings was chosen as the sculptor because Whitaker admired his sculptures of John Betjeman at St Pancras station and Philip Larkin in Hull. Jennings said that Orwell was \\"...an ideal subject for a sculptor: loomingly tall, skinny as a rake, forever [with] fag in hand, body leaning in to make a point. He wore the kind of clothes that might have spent their off-duty hours hanging from a nail in the potting shed\\". Reception The architectural critic Gavin Stamp (under the pseudonym \\"Piloti\\"), in Private Eye, awarded the statue the \\"Sir Hugh Casson Award for 2017's ugliest new building\\" ‚Äì \\"if sculpture is eligible\\". Orwell \\"surely deserves better\\", he wrote. \\"The great man is depicted holding a fag, dressed in a crumpled suit and standing like a music hall artist about to crack a joke. The plinth is pathetic. ... No hint here of Orwell's ambivalent relationship with the BBC.\\" Jennings pointed out that \\"smoking was so much a part of [Orwell's] identity that it would have been unthinkable not to represent him with a roll-up between his fingers.\\" Professor Richard Keeble, then Chair of The Orwell Society, responded in Private Eye's letters page that \\"the plinth on which the statue stands seems to fit in perfectly with the building\\". On BBC Radio 4's Front Row, the critic Sarah Gaventa also questioned the use of a plinth for this \\"man of the people\\". Gaventa was approving of the sculpture itself. \\"You can see he wants to get into the conversation and give you his very honest and forthright opinions. It's Orwell. Who else could it be? When you look at the canon of Martin Jennings's work‚Ä¶ it's about brave people who speak out. I‚Äôm sure it will become a much-loved addition to the BBC\\". On BBC News Jennings explained his decision to elevate the statue: \\"Of course you make aesthetic decisions as well. He‚Äôs up against a great big cliff of a stone wall and you need to frame it within that space. It couldn‚Äôt have been at ground level\\". In 2018 the statue won Jennings the Public Monuments and Sculpture Association's Marsh Award for Excellence in Public Sculpture. This was the first time the prize had been awarded to the same sculptor for two years in succession, Jennings having won in 2017 with Women of Steel, a sculptural group in Sheffield.

In United States constitutional law, fundamental rights have special significance under the U.S. Constitution. Those rights enumerated in the U.S. Constitution are recognized as \\"fundamental\\" by the U.S. Supreme Court. State courts within the United States may define fundamental error rules independently of the federal courts. State fundamental error rules may include errors which violate rights in additional to those rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, but these rules may not infringe upon federal fundamental rights. Any law restricting such a right must both serve a compelling state purpose and be narrowly tailored to that compelling purpose. Judicial errors A fundamental error is a type of legal or judicial error. A judicial error is a mistake by a judge or court. If a majority of a reviewing court, such as an appellate court, finds an error or errors which impacts the result, the higher court may reverse the lower court's error in whole or in part (the entire judgment or a part of it), and remand (send it back) with instructions to the lower court. There are various types of errors which fall under two groups: harmless errors and plain errors. Errors which have no prejudicial impact on the rights of a party are deemed harmless errors. Higher courts will not reverse or remand the lower court's decision for harmless errors. A plain error is an error that is obvious and affects \\"the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\\". Plain errors are typically reversible errors. Higher courts will always reverse or remand the lower court's decision for reversible errors. Fundamental errors are both plain errors and reversible errors. Fundamental errors are similar to substantial errors; however, the definition of a \\"substantial error\\" may differ slightly among the courts. A fundamental error is consistent among all US Courts as these errors violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by the US Constitution. In other words, all substantial errors are not necessarily fundamental errors, but all fundamental errors are substantial errors. Errors affecting fundamental rights Courts often review questions of whether a fundamental error occurred in post-conviction proceedings, such as a direct appeal, the writ of habeas corpus or the writ of coram nobis. Fundamental error, as a rule, is an extremely difficult claim to succeed in an appeal. Congress and state legislatures may enact regulations on these proceeding, such as time limits for the filing post-conviction motions, in efforts to reduce judicial caseloads. In Murray v. Carrier, the Supreme Court ruled that the concept of fundamental error applies to those cases in which the defendant was probably ... actually innocent.\\" The Court then specified that \\"in an extraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent, a federal habeas court may grant the writ even in the absence of a showing of cause for the procedural default.\\" A petitioner may lose their chance to claim a violation of his or her Fundamental rights if there is a procedural default on the claim. Some procedural defaults include intentionally waiving their right to make the claim, or not filing the claim in a timely manner. If state courts provide adequate means of challenging federal fundamental errors, then a procedural default may not be appealed to a federal court. However, if state courts do not provide adequate means of challenging the errors, then a federal court has jurisdiction to hear the claim. The Supreme Court held in Coleman v. Thompson that a petitioner who failed to comply with a timeliness requirement in a state court could nevertheless plead their claims on the merits in federal court if he or she could show that \\"failure to consider the claims [would] result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\\" Application in United States Federal Case Law A fundamental error occurs whenever a defendant was probably actually innocent. In Murray v. Carrier, the Supreme Court ruled that the concept of \\"fundamental miscarriage of justice\\" applies to those cases in which the defendant was probably actually innocent.\\" That concern is reflected, for example, in the \\"fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free.\\" A fundamental error occurs whenever there is a failure to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the charged offense. In United States v. McClelland, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that \\"the failure to properly instruct the jury on [the required] element of a crime constitutes fundamental error\\". A fundamental error occurs whenever a defendant stands convicted of conduct that is not criminal. In United States v. Stoneman, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found a fundamental error occurs where a defendant stands convicted of conduct that is not criminal. If a defendant is convicted and punished for act that law does not make criminal, it \\"inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice\\" and presents \\"exceptional circumstances\\" which justify collateral relief.

(meaning Read! in German) is to provide a Quran translation to every household in Germany. According to the founder, around 3.5 million copies were distributed by mid-2016. The organization was successfully banned in November 2016 by the German government following its proven recruitment of jihadists to fight in Syria and Iraq for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, also known as ISIS. http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2016-11/die-wahre- religion-islam-salafisten-faq Retrieved 2017-04-30 Ibrahim Abou-Nagie Die wahre Religion's founder is Gaza-born Palestinian Ibrahim Abou-Nagie (in Arabic ÿ•ÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸáŸäŸÖ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿà ŸÜÿßÿ¨Ÿä), an immigrant Salafist preacher. He arrived in Germany in 1982 as an 18-year-old and claims to have run successful businesses, although those claims have not been substantiated. He became a German citizen in 1984. He describes a religious awakening in 2003 after which he became a preacher. Abou-Nagie promoted the idea of distributing Qurans to German passers-by. Abou-Nagie has been known to German security officials since 2005, the year he created a website described by officials as spreading extremist propaganda. Abou-Nagie was alleged to have openly preached against democracy and other Western values, in a video proclaiming \\"Democracy is against Islam. And it is the opposite of Islam.\\" He also opined that \\"If someone is married and commits adultery, he must be stoned.\\" Abou Nagie has also said that homosexuals must be executed in order to \\"protect Muslims,\\" and proclaimed that \\"disbelievers\\" will burn in hell. An attempt to prosecute Abou-Nagie on charges of incitement of religious hatred failed in 2012.

The campaign is known in German as Lies! (German for Read!) and is active in several countries including the United Kingdom, France, Bahrain and Brazil under the general Arabic language name Iqraa!

It has pinnate leaves and white to pink flowers that are arranged singly or in groups of up to seven, in the leaf axils or on the ends of the branches.habit in a subalpine sclerophyll woodland Description Boronia citriodora is a woody shrub that is sometimes prostrate, otherwise erect and growing to a height of . It has pinnate leaves that are long and wide in outline with between three and nine leaflets, on a petiole long. The end leaflet is narrow elliptic to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide. The side leaflets are similar but longer. The flowers are white to pink and are arranged singly or in groups of up to seven in leaf axils or on the ends of branches on a stalk long. The four sepals are triangular, long and wide. The four petals are long and the eight stamens have a few short hairs. Flowering occurs from November to February and the mature fruit are smooth, long and wide. Taxonomy and naming Boronia citriodora was first formally described in 1855 by Joseph Dalton Hooker from an unpublished description by Ronald Campbell Gunn and the description was published in The botany of the Antarctic voyage of H.M. Discovery ships Erebus and Terror. The name is derived from the characteristic lemon scent of the foliage. Hooker noted that the plant has a \\"strong and delicious smell of lemons\\" and that the species was called the 'lemon-plant' by early Tasmanian colonists. In 2003, Marco Duretto described three subspecies: * Boronia citriodora subsp. citriodora that has smooth sepals and leaves less than long; * Boronia citriodora subsp. orientalis that has hairy sepals; * Boronia citriodora subsp. paulwilsonii that has smooth sepals and at least some leaves more than long.

Registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List, it is nowadays the location of a junior high school. Copernicanum, 1910 In 1923, to celebrate the 450th anniversary of the birth of Nicolaus Copernicus, the newly created junior high school adopted his name, Copernicanum. History In the beginning of the 20th century, Prussian authorities of Bromberg decided to have a realschule built on the outskirts of then city downtown. The commissioned architects, Carl Zaar and Rudolf Vahl, had just completed together in 1901 the S≈Çupsk Town Hall in the nearby Prussian Province of Pomerania within the German Empire. Carl Zaar (K√∂ln, 1849-Berlin 1924), was a pupil of architect Julius Carl Raschdorff, one of the leading German architects of the second half of the 19th century. He was a supporter of German historicism and designed the Berlin Cathedral. Rudolf Vahl had a construction engineer background and came from Berlin. In the late 1910s, the wing onto Paderewskiego street has been rebuilt. The building housed the city realschule from its inception till October 15, 1921, when it housed the Polish Municipal High School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (), then at Paderewskiego street. In the 1930s, it became a High school for boys, . During Nazi occupation, the building served, among others, as a military hospital. After the war, the edifice housed vocational schools: * The Technical school of the Posts and Telegraphs Ministry; * The Technical railway school - School Group N¬∞13 , which was disbanded in August 2007. Since 2005, the Copernicanum building has been the property of Bydgoszcz University, or UKW . Between 2005 and 2007, heavy restoration works, including upgrades to current standards, were performed over the facility, allowing UKW to house the Institute of Mechanics and Applied Informatics, . Architecture =Exteriors= The edifice has an L-shaped footprint boasting Art Nouveau style, registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List.

The left one, bearing a large sundial, houses long and tall windows of the main hall. It is adorned on the top with owl shapes -symbol of knowledge- flanking a decorative stucco ribbon, crowned by the date of completion of the edifice (1906). The left avant-corps, although less majestic, is topped by a large round observation tower overhanging the mansard roofs. The massive portal, flanked by pilasters, displays a curved transom ornamented with stucco ribbon motifs. On top of the transom light are visible Bydgoszcz and Poland coats of arm. Facade on Paderewskiego Street This frontage, albeit less decorated, offers more uniformity as far as architectural details are concerned. Facade shows high openings at each floor, topped by dormers with various shape: kernel, semi- circular with pediment or even grand ogee model. One can also make out some decorative rosettes. Backyard In the backyard of the building grow two large silver maples (330 and 430 cm diameter), identified as Natural landmarks of Bydgoszcz. =Interiors= In addition of all the renovated class and experiment/technical rooms, a refurbished concert hall has been unveiled in 2010.

This purchase price caused dissent among Tartars crew as Portsmouth's merchants had made a counter-offer of more than ¬£5,000, the acceptance of which would have increased the prize money. Perhaps with an eye to their future careers, Tartars officers accepted the Admiralty's lower offer but requested indemnification against any legal action brought by the crew for loss of earnings.McLeod 2010, p.116 The newly purchased vessel was immediately commissioned for Royal Navy service as a sixth-rate under the name Tartar's Prize. Commander Thomas Baillie of Tartar was promoted to post-captain and transferred to take command.Winfield 2007, p. 227, 265 A survey of the vessel quickly revealed difficulties with her armament. One of the six-pounder cannons had burst during the March engagement with Tartar, and an examination of the others revealed that most were very poorly made. They were also too large; the gun barrels were long in a gundeck measuring only on each side, leaving insufficient room for the crew to reload when the guns had recoiled after firing.McLeod 2010, pp.118‚Äì119 Baillie wrote to the Board of Ordnance protesting the uselessness of these oversized cannon, and was eventually rewarded with replacement six-pounders of a more standard length. He was less successful with a further problem aboard the vessel; the gun ports had no lids, leaving the gundeck constantly awash in heavy swell. Despite requests these were not installed, leaving the crew to rig canvas awnings over the open ports in order to reduce the flow of seawater into the hull. Provisioned and manned by July, the vessel was returned to the English Channel to assist in safe convoy for a fleet of West Indiamen, and then in company with Tartar to hunt privateers. She had her first and only victory within weeks of leaving port, capturing the French vessel La Marquise de Chateaunois on 17 July. Despite this victory Tartars Prize was experiencing considerable difficulty with her long, sleek design, which increased her speed but made her unwieldy and liable to roll in heavy weather. In August Baillie was forced to make port in Spanish Corunna so that he could restow the cargo and take on ballast to stabilise the ship. He returned Tartars Prize to sea in September, where she promptly sprang a leak and started taking on 18 inches of water each hour. Forced back into port for repairs, Baillie wrote to Admiralty requesting stronger decking and timbers so that the hull would not keep opening up at the seams. A different issue had arisen in the galley, which had been built to provision the small crew of a French privateer and could not cater for the Royal Navy's larger complement of 160 men. The ship's cook, Bartholomew Barry, complained that the galley's two fireplaces were in constant operation but they had no external vents, leading to a \\"smokiness which in truth is so great that no man living can stand it.\\"Correspondence, Captain Thomas Baillie to Admiralty Board, 1757. Cited in McLeod 2010, p. 118 There were no stoves, and all cooking had to be done in kettles suspended from cables over the fires. Barry reported that these kettles regularly burned through their supports and fell onto the deck, scalding the crew. There is no record of Admiralty's responses to these concerns. In October Baillie received orders assigning Tartars Prize to the Navy's Mediterranean squadron, with which she was present at the Battle of Lagos in 1759. On 2 March 1760 one of the vessel's hull timbers entirely gave way and she foundered off the Sardinian coast. Baillie and his crew successfully abandoned ship, were rescued by a passing Dutch merchantman and returned to England. The Admiralty apportioned no blame to any person for the loss of the vessel, but Captain Baillie was not assigned another seagoing command. Through personal connections he was awarded a shore- based position at London's Greenwich Hospital and later at the Board of Ordnance; never promoted beyond post-captain, he died in 1802.

It stars Aarti Patel, Raj Vazir, Satyam Sharma, Aashna Mehta & Saumya Shah in lead roles. This is the second film by Ashish Kakkad, after Better Half. Mission Mummy is produced under the banner of Virtual Entertainment. It is also co-produced by Ashish Kakkad. The story of the film is based on a book by Dhiruben Patel. The screenplay and dialogues are written by Dipak Soliya and Ashish Kakkad. The film celebrates the idea of \\"being Gujarati\\" and hence poet and lyricist Tushar Shukla was approached for a song portraying the love for the mother tongue. Plot Aparna (Aarti Patel), a working woman, quits her job to become a full-time mother. She raises her three kids Vyom (Satyam Sharma), Saloni (Aashna Mehta) and Vismay (Saumya Shah), with much love and care, and now that the kids are grownups, she is wondering if she should resume her career. Over the years, she has devoted her time and sacrificed her career for her children. But the kids now find her \\"old fashioned\\" and start to visualize a new image of her on their own. They demand their mother to be a modern and trendy lady. When Aparna wants to resume her career, the kids gradually intensify their demand to make mummy a modern woman. Their definition of modern is simple: everything has to be \\"western\\" and not \\"Gujarati\\". Aparna tries to pacify them but peer pressure makes the kids more resolute in their demand for a modern mummy. They call it \\"mission mummy\\". The mission is then implemented and everything changes in that family, forever. The film beautifully touches on the important issue that in \\"happy families\\" of Gujarati community, there is a \\"set trend\\" of growing gap between mother and kids. It is not just a schism between the generations, it is a gap between the culture within the house and the culture outside. The strength of this film is that it presents a serious issue in a light-hearted and vibrant manner.

The Yaroslavsky suburban railway line connects Moscow with the stations in the northeast, in particular, with the towns of Mytishchi, Korolyov, Ivanteyevka, Fryazino, Shchyolkovo, Pushkino, Krasnoarmeysk, Sergiyev Posad, Strunino, and Alexandrov. The stations the line serves are located in Moscow, as well as in the towns of Mytishchi, Kaliningrad, Shchyolkovo, Ivanteyevka, Fryazino, Noginsk, Pushkino, Krasnoarmeysk, and Sergiyev-Posad in Moscow Oblast, as well as Alexandrovsky District of Vladimir Oblast. The suburban trains have their southwestern terminus at Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station in Moscow. In the northeastern direction, the suburban trains terminate at Bolshevo, Fryazino Passazhirskaya, Monino, Shchyolkovo, Fryazevo, Pushkino, Sofrino, Krasnoarmeysk, Sergiyev Posad, Alexandrov, and Balakirevo. The line is served by the Moscow Railway. The suburban railway line follows the railway which connects Moscow with Yaroslavl and continues to Arkhangelsk in the north and Vladivostok in the south. It is electrified (dc current) between Moscow and Balakirevo (and further to Danilov). Between Moscow and Balakirevo, there are at least two tracks. The distance between Yaroslavsky railway station and Balakirevo is . In Fryazevo, the railway connects to the Gorkovsky suburban railway line. The section between 81 km and Alexandrov coincides with the Greater Ring of the Moscow Railway. History The construction of the railway between Moscow and Sergiyev Posad was completed in 1862. In 1869, it was extended to Yaroslavl. The railway line between Mytishchi and Fryazevo was open in several installments: In 1895, to Shchyolkovo, in 1929 to Monino, in 1930 to Ivanteyevka, in 1935 to Fryazino, and in 1970 to Fryazevo. In the 1920s, Yaroslavsky suburban railway line became the first suburban railway line in the Soviet Union to be electrified. In 1929, the electrification was completed between Moscow and Mytishchi. In 1930, the electrification was extended to Pushkino and Shchyolkovo, in 1931 to Sofrino, and in 1932 to Zagorsk (currently Sergiyev Posad). In the 1930s, some suburban trains run to Mytishchi and then were separated, with one part running to Pushkino, and another one to Shchyolkovo. The far distance passenger trains were still moved by steam locomotives. In 1937, the electrification was extended to Alexandrov. However, the section between Moscow and Zagorsk used dc current with 1500 Volts, and the one between Zagorsk and Alexandrov used dc current with 3000 Volts, therefore it was not suitable for suburban trains. In 1949, first suburban trains able to work with both voltages appeared, subsequently the railway platforms between Zagorsk and Alexandrov were raised to serve these trains, and in 1949 direct suburban trains from Moscow started to serve Alexandrov. During World War II, the wires were removed, and suburban trains were moved by steam locomotives, however, in 1943 the suburban railway line was re-electrified. In 1934, the section between Mytishchi and Chkalovakaya was electrified. In 1936, the electrification was extended to Monino, in 1948 to Fryazino. The section between Monino and Fryazevo was constructed electrified. In 1994, the electrification was extended to Krasnoarmeysk, and direct trains from Moscow started running. In 1900, a railway line connecting Beskudnikovo and Losinoostrovskaya was constructed. This was done in order to facilitate the railway traffic between Moscow and Kimry (Savyolovo), since Moscow Savyolovsky railway station was not open yet. After a tram line from central line to Medvedkovo was built, in 1966 a direct connection to Losinoostrovskaya was discontinued, and the whole railway line was demolished in 1987. In 1930, a railway line between Mytishchi and Pirogovo was built. It was closed down in 1997 and subsequently demolished.

MK-0773 is a 4-azasteroid and a potent and selective agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). It binds to the AR with an IC50 of 6.6 nM and is a partial agonist in transactivation modulation of the AR with an IP of 25 nM and Emax of 78% and has a TRAF2 Emax of 29% and a virilization (N/C interaction) counterscreen assay Emax of 2%. That is, it produces promoter activation but induces the N/C interaction almost negligibly. MK-0773 is reportedly four times as potent as testosterone as an agonist of the AR. The drug is selective and does not bind to other steroid hormone receptors such as the progesterone receptor or glucocorticoid receptor and shows no significant inhibition of 5Œ±-reductase (IC50 > 10 ŒºM). In addition, it is non-aromatizable and hence has no potential for estrogenic effects or side effects, like gynecomastia. MK-0773 had similar effects on lipid metabolism relative to DHT, including a decrease in total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of a similar magnitude. MK-0773 shows tissue-selective androgenic effects in vivo in animals. It increases lean body mass with maximal anabolic effects that are approximately 80% of those of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, it had less than 5% of the effect of DHT on uterine weight, about 30 to 50% of the increase of sebaceous gland area induced by DHT, and increased the weight of the seminal vesicles by 12% of that of DHT at the highest dosage assessed. It had similarly reduced effects on the prostate gland. No significant increase in gene expression of six candidate genes of virilization was observed. As such, MK-0773 shows a profile of an anabolic SARM with limited effects on sebaceous glands and reproductive tissues in animals and a minimal propensity for virilization. In human clinical studies, MK-0773 produced anabolism in women and men while producing no or very low effects on sebaceous glands, the endometrium, or the prostate gland after 12 weeks of treatment. A decrease in total cholesterol and HDL was also observed in the clinical studies. MK-0773 produced a significant increase in lean body mass in elderly (‚â•65 years of age) women with sarcopenia and moderate physical dysfunction. It also increased muscle strength relative to placebo but this failed to reach statistical significance. MK-0773 has been associated with elevated liver enzymes in clinical studies.

In 1970 he was a founding member of the doo-wop band, Daddy Cool, providing bass guitar and backing vocals. They were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2006. During his career he had also been a member of the Rondells, Sons of the Vegetal Mother, Gary Young's Hot Dog, Jane Clifton and the Go Go Boys, the Black Sorrows, and the Hornets. In late November 2016 Duncan had a stroke and died a week later, he was survived by his domestic partner, Anne, and by two children. According to Australian music journalist, Ian McFarlane, \\"Duncan was never a sedate bassist. One only has to listen to some of the latter-day DC material... to hear how inventive his playing could be.\\"  Early years to the Rondells  Wayne Ian Duncan was born on 31 May 1944 and grew up in Preston, a Melbourne suburb, as one of six children. Duncan left Northcote High School, aged 15, to work as a copy boy for a newspaper. He learned to play bass guitar and, from 1959, periodically performed in instrumental groups including the Ramrods and then the Lincolns. Duncan and Gary Young (drums, vocals) were the rhythm section of numerous Melbourne-based bands from 1963. They first worked together when Duncan joined Young in the Lincolns, replacing Ian Allen on bass guitar, alongside Gil Matthews on guitar, Ed Nantes on guitar and Roger Treble on lead guitar. Duncan had been taught bass guitar by Allen. The Lincolns added a singer, Bob Johnson, when beat music broke through in 1964. The Lincolns changed their name to the Rondells whenever they backed Bobby & Laurie, a popular singing duo of Bobby Bright and Laurie Allen. The touring version of the Rondells in 1965 were Duncan, Treble and Young joined by John Sullivan on rhythm guitar who was later replaced by Barry Rodgers. Bobby & Laurie, backed by the Rondells, had a No. 1 hit, with their cover version of Roger Miller's \\"Hitch Hiker\\", in May 1966. The Rondells also backed other artists: Bobby Knight, Lynne Randell, Buddy England, Billy Adams and Bobby Shore. In February 1967, following the split of Bobby & Laurie, Allen formed a soul music group, Dice, later renamed the Laurie Allen Revue. The line-up included Duncan and Young, with Barry Rogers, Phil Manning on guitar and backing singers, sisters Glenys and Colleen Hewett. The Revue released three singles on Festival Records ‚Äì \\"Beautiful Brown Eyes\\" (August 1967), \\"Any Little Bit\\" (April 1968) and \\"As Long As I Got You\\" (June 1968).  Sons of the Vegetal Mother to Daddy Cool  Duncan and Young formed a progressive rock group, Sons of the Vegetal Mother in late 1969 with Ross Hannaford on lead vocals and lead guitar, and Ross Wilson on lead vocals, harmonica and rhythm guitar. It had an experimental sound and a floating line-up of auxiliary members. They included: Mike Rudd (later in Spectrum) (bass guitar), Trevor Griffin (piano), Jeremy Kellock (Jeremy Noone) (tenor sax), Tim Partridge (bass guitar), Ian Wallace (alto sax), Simon Wettenhall (trumpet) and Bruce Woodcock (tenor sax). As a side project of the Sons of the Vegetal Mother, Duncan, Hannaford, Wilson and Young formed Daddy Cool in 1970. In May 1971 Rosemary Fairbarn of The Canberra Times caught their performance and observed, \\"With a sound so together and free of mind-blasting, complicated pieces, its rhythm arousing the dancers and its non-association with rockie back-jazz... their harmony is the zinging powerful force behind their simple rock and roll beat.\\" According to Australian music journalist, Ian McFarlane, \\"Duncan and Young comprised the tightest rhythm section of the day, with Duncan's melodic, yet always 'in the pocket', bass lines as the solid pulse for the whole... Duncan was never a sedate bassist. One only has to listen to some of the latter-day DC material, such as 'Hi Honey Ho', 'Daddy Rocks Off', 'Teenage Blues', 'Teen Love/Drive-In Movie/Love in a F.J.' or 'Make Your Stash', to hear how inventive his playing could be.\\" The group were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 2006. During his career Duncan had also been a member of Gary Young's Hot Dog, Jane Clifton and the Go Go Boys, the Black Sorrows, and the Hornets. Daddy Cool, with Duncan, Hannaford, Wilson and Young, reformed in 2005, released a single in February of that year and play at a benefit concert for victims of the 2004 tsunami at the Myer Music Bowl, Melbourne. A new Daddy Cool recording, \\"The Christmas Bug\\", was released for charity. A new Daddy Cool album, The New Cool was released in 2007 on Liberation Records.

The San Francisco Temple was erected by the Franciscan Order, who evangelized in the place, having originally built a small chapel of smaller proportions, as well as the convent attached. The first stone of this temple was erected on February 2 of the year 1683. The Cathedral of Celaya is not the Temple of San Francisco. The Cathedral is located to the side of the aforementioned Franciscan temple and has been administered for many years by the diocesan clergy. The advances in the work were slow; By 1715 the vaults had been closed, and by the year 1725 the tower was completed.

The species was described by Geoff Mansell, owner of Exotica Plants. It has so far been recorded with certainty from only two mountains, where it grows in submontane mossy forest at an altitude of up to 1800 m above sea level. It has been found in close proximity to N. copelandii, N. truncata, and a taxon matching the description of N. cornuta.  Discovery  In September 2011 participants on a trip to a remote mountain on south- eastern Mindanao, Stewart McPherson sighted epiphytically growing black Nepenthes truncata-like plants and photos were taken from a distance; it was stated by some of the participants on this same trip that this was evidence of the then newly described N. robcantleyi in habitat. However, due to the distance and foggy surroundings, no real distinguishing features could be observed in the photo except for superficial similarities to both N. truncata. On seeing the photo and noticing differences between these plants and N. robcantleyi, Exotica Plants organized several trips to the mountain in 2012 in hope of obtaining more details of the plants. These were undertaken by Philippine botanist and Nepenthes/orchid taxonomist Wally Suarez. The mountain was very foggy, leeches as well as spiny rattans were abundant, which made the ascent difficult. After three attempts the expedition successfully located a colony of the plants and a set of photographs were obtained which clearly distinguished these plants as different from both N. robcantleyi and N. truncata.  Relationship to Nepenthes Robcantleyi  Nepenthes nebularum shows close affinities to N. robcantleyi and N. truncata, and the describing authors suggested that N. robcantleyi might represent a natural hybrid between N. nebularum and N. truncata. Nepenthes nebularum is distinguished from N. robcantleyi by its smaller stature, predominantly epiphytic (rarely lithophytic) habit, a complete absence of bracts on the inflorescence, and the presence of a dense woolly indumentum on the petiole wings, tendrils, and pitchers.  Distribution and habitat  The specific epithet nebularum refers to the foggy habitat in which it was discovered.

He joined the Royal Navy during WWII, serving as a Navy radio mechanic posted in the United States and Australia; in both of these postings he volunteered as a Scout leader. where he remained active in Scouting. Upon returning to England at the end of World War II, he used the radio skills learned during the war to apply for an amateur transmitting licence. In 1961, he married Eileen Phillippa Hawkins, the daughter of a Welsh-born doctor; their only child, daughter Rosemary, was born in 1967.Marriage certificate; birth certificate (Rosemary Ann Mitchell) Mitchell's Scouting work was voluntary; after the War, he had joined the civil service, and he worked for many years at government science research facilities at Winfrith in Dorset and Datchet in Berkshire, managing transport arrangements. Birth of JOTA Mitchell tried for several years after the war to interest Scouts in amateur radio, without success until the 9th World Scout Jamboree at Sutton Park in 1957, when the first amateur radio station was established in the Jamboree area, under the call sign GB3SP. The Jamboree radio station was run by local radio amateurs, but Scouts and leaders attending the camp were only permitted to observe. Mitchell was surprised at the number of Scout radio operators from around the world that he met there and they had several meetings near the radio station during the event. At the end of the Jamboree, they all agreed to contact each other on a specific day, which Mitchell agreed to arrange. Subsequently, Mitchell decided to expand that meeting day to a weekend, and invite other radio operators with an interest in Scouting to open their stations to local Scouts so that they could participate. As an experiment in October 1957, Mitchell set up a 40 Watt AM transmitter in a tent outside his Scout Group's hall in Reading; the Scouts were able to make contacts all over the world, proving that the idea was viable. Having gained the necessary permission from the radio licensing authority and The Scout Association and having drawn up a set of simple rules which are still in use today, the first Jamboree-on-the-Air followed in May 1958, and thereafter annually in October. Mitchell quickly gained the support of the World Scout Bureau for the event. Mitchell and the development of JOTA As JOTA grew year-on-year, Mitchell was gratified by the increasing number of qualified operators within the Scout Movement. In 1975, Mitchell gave the opening address at the first Radio Scouting Conference in Lillehammer, Norway, during the 14th World Scout Jamboree. In 1978, Mitchell was awarded the 132nd Bronze Wolf Award, the only distinction given by the World Organization of the Scout Movement, awarded for an individual's exceptional services to world Scouting over many years.List of recipients of the Bronze Wolf Award The 40th JOTA in 1997 celebrated its anniversary by operating the World Scout Organization call-sign from the 79th Reading Scout HQ in Reading where the first JOTA was held, with Mitchell on transmitting along with other veterans of the first JOTA. In later life, Mitchell became a keen family historian and a popular speaker at local and family history societies. He continued to participate in JOTA, either in person at a station or on the air, until within a few years of his death.private family information Mitchell died shortly before JOTA 2014 and during the event at 12:00 UTC on 18 October, a one minute silence was observed by the participants of both JOTA and Jamboree on the Internet (JOTI) which runs in tandem with JOTA; the participation in both events in 2014 was officially stated to be 1,332,265 Scouts and Guides from 157 countries. Mitchell's funeral was held at St Peter's Parish Church, Rawdon near Leeds on 20 October; amongst the Scouters present was Richard Middelkoop, the advisor on Radio Scouting to the World Organization of the Scout Movement, who had flown in from Geneva.

The eastern terminus of the cycleway is in the Sydney Olympic Park, while the western terminus is in South Wentworthville. Route =Sydney Olympic Park to Auburn= With an extensive network of on-road and shared paths located within Sydney Olympic Park, the cycleways eastern terminus is on Australia Avenue and continues west via the Holker Busway where the shared busway and on-road cycleway cross the Haslams Creek and meet with Hill Road. From this junction in , several options are available to meet the north-south shared pedestrian and cycle path, the Louise Sauvage Pathway, shared with the cycleway, as it heads south and follows the western bank of Haslams Creek which can be hazardous at points of high tide. The path goes under the M4 and enters , initially as a segregated path and then joins Adderley Street East before joining a major intersection with Silverwater Road (A6), with traffic exiting the M4 from the east and entering the M4, heading west and limited cyclist and pedestrian protection on the traffic island. The path continues along Adderley Street West, from into , climbing to a roundabout at Stubbs Street, subject to heavy flows during peak traffic times. As the path continues further west it passes the former Roads & Maritime Services' toll plaza. The main path crosses the Duck River and continues further west. A spur path leads south, to the Great Western Highway (A44). =Auburn to Parramatta= The relatively scenic route on the northern shore of the Duck River carries the cycleway further west. Signs along the path explain the history of the industrial heartland of the area including a now-defunct Duck River ferry service that allowed passengers and freight to alight. In this ear, the path crosses former freight tracks. The end of this part of the pathway is the quiet, back streets of , parallel to Parramatta Road. From Rosehill to the path continues west towards Parramatta. The start of this path adjoins an L-plate motorcycle school and a small corkscrew climb to reach the bridge that runs overhead of James Ruse Drive and on the northern side of the M4. The bridge is a remarkable piece of industrial art and allows cyclists to be protected from the traffic. The path is secure at this stage and it winds down underneath the M4, above the Duck Creek and the A'Becketts Creek. The path runs through the middle of the M4 cement columns which forms a scenic reminder, albeit suburban, of the functionality of the path. The path continues to follow the cement colonnade of the M4. On either side of the path are access points from Harris Park. Near the junction of Parramatta Road, Church Street, and Woodville Road, where the M$ passes over the junction, the cycleway provides various spur options: the north to Parramatta central business district via High, Wigram, or Railway Streets; and to the south to and via Woodville Road and adjacent side-streets. =Parramatta to Wentworthville= Between Fox Street, Holroyd and Ledger Road, Merrylands the cycleway becomes a off road shared bicycle and pedestrian path. Constructed between 2010 and 2011, the path was built along the southern embankment of the M4 motorway about above the road level and is completely fenced off and protected from motorway traffic. Continuing west and after crossing Burnett Street, the cycleway joins Rita Street where it provides a spur option to the north via an underpass to access Rees and Pitt Streets and then north to Parramatta Park. Yje cycleway crosses Coleman Street, Merrylands and continues west before reaching a junction with Allen Street and the Finlayson Creek. Here, a spur line to the north passes under the M4 and provides access to a road crossing of the Great Western Highway and the shopping centre. Another spur line follows Finlayson Creek to the south, with local access to Merrylands. Continuing further west, the cycleway terminates at a junction near the Prospect Highway on the boundary between Merryland, and , where the cycleway seamlessly joins the Liverpool‚ÄìParramatta T-way.

From being more culture-focused in the Imperial Russian and Soviet periods, it went through several phases, evolving into radical ethnocentric in the late 1980s and early in the post-Soviet independence years, and to a more inclusive and civic-oriented form in the mid-2000s. However, vestiges of ethnic nationalism remain among many Georgians.  Emergence  Modern Georgian nationalism emerged in the middle of the 19th century as a reaction to the Russian annexation of fragmented Georgian polities, which terminated their precarious independence, but brought to the Georgians unity under a single authority, relative peace and stability. The first to inspire national revival were aristocratic poets, whose romanticist writings were imbued with patriotic laments. After a series of ill-fated attempts at revolt, especially, after the failed coup plot of 1832, the Georgian elites reconciled with the Russian rule, while their calls for national awakening were rechanneled through cultural efforts. In the 1860s, the new generation of Georgian intellectuals, educated at Russian universities and exposed to European ideas, promoted national culture against assimilation by the Imperial center. Led by the literati such as Ilia Chavchavadze, their program attained more nationalistic colors as the nobility declined and capitalism progressed, further stimulated by the rule of the Russian bureaucracy and economic and demographic dominance of the Armenian middle class in the capital city of Tbilisi. Chavchavadze and his associates called for the unity of all Georgians and put national interests above class and provincial divisions. Their vision did not envisage an outright revolt for independence, but demanded autonomy within the reformed Russian Empire, with greater cultural freedom, promotion of the Georgian language, and support for Georgian educational institutions and the national church, whose independence had been suppressed by the Russian government. Despite their advocacy of ethnic culture and demographic grievances over Russian and Armenian dominance in Georgia's urban centers, a program of the early Georgian nationalists was inclusive and preferred non-confrontational approach to inter-ethnic issues. Some of them, such as Niko Nikoladze, envisaged the creation of a free, decentralized, and self-governing federation of the Caucasian peoples based on the principle of ethnically proportional representation. The idea of Caucasian federation within the reformed Russian state was also voiced by the ideologues of Georgian social democracy, who came to dominate Georgian political landscape by the closing years of the 19th century. Initially, the Georgian Social Democrats were opposed to nationalism and viewed it as a rival ideology, but they remained proponents of self- determination. In the words of the historian Stephen F. Jones, \\"it was socialism in Georgian colors with priority given to the defense of national culture.\\" The Georgian social-democrats were very active in all-Russian socialist movement and after its split in 1905 sided with the Menshevik faction adhering to relatively liberal ideas of their Western European colleagues.  First Georgian republic  The Bolshevik revolution of 1917 was perceived by the Georgian Mensheviks, led by Noe Zhordania, as a breach of links between Russia and Europe. When they declared Georgia an independent democratic republic on 26 May 1918, they viewed the move as a tragic inevitability against the background of unfolding geopolitical realities. As the new state faced a series of domestic and international challenges, the internationalist Social-Democratic leadership became more focused on narrower national problems. With this reorientation to a form of nationalism, the Georgian republic became a \\"nationalist/socialist hybrid.\\" The government's efforts to make education and administration more Georgian drew protests from ethnic minorities, further exacerbated by economic hardship and exploited for their political ends by the Bolsheviks who promoted the export of revolution. The government's response to dissent, including among the ethnic minorities, such as the Abkhaz and Ossetians, was frequently violent and excessive. The decision to resort to military solutions was driven by security concerns rather than readiness to settle ethnic scores. Overall, the Georgian Mensheviks did not turn to authoritarianism and terror. However, the events of that time played an important role in reinforcing stereotypes on all involved sides in the latter-day ethnic conflicts in Georgia.  Soviet Georgia  After the sovietization of Georgia in 1921, followed by suppression of an armed rebellion against the new regime in 1924, many leading nationalist intellectuals went in exile in Europe. In the Soviet Union, Georgian nationalism went underground or was rechanneled into cultural pursuits, becoming focused on the issues of language, promotion of education, protection of old monuments, literature, film, and sports. Any open manifestation of local nationalism was repressed by the Soviet state, but it did provide cultural frameworks and, as part of its policy of korenizatsiya, helped institutionalize the Georgians as a \\"titular nationality\\" in the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. Thus, by maintaining the focus of Georgian nationalism on cultural issues, the Soviet regime was able to prevent it from becoming a political movement until the 1980s perestroika period. The late 1970s saw a re-emergence of Georgian nationalism that clashed with Soviet power. Plans to revise the status of Georgian as the official language of Soviet Georgia were drawn up in the Kremlin in early 1978, but after stiff and unprecedented public resistance the Soviet central government abandoned the plans. At the same time, it also abandoned similar revision plans for the official languages in the Armenian and Azerbaijani SSRs. Georgian nationalism was eventually more tolerated during the waning years of the USSR due to Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost policy. The Soviet government attempted to counter the Georgian independence movement in the early 1990s with promises of greater decentralisation from Moscow.

He is a technologist, entrepreneur and developer with a career dedicated to building the Internet of Things both in the cloud and on embedded Things. He is particularly known for his early contributions to the Web of Things alongside with other researchers such as Vlad Trifa, Erik Wilde and Friedemann Mattern. Guinard is a published researcher, a book author and a recognized expert in Internet of Things technologies Career Guinard studied Computer Science at Universit√© de Fribourg and graduated with a master's degree in computer science with a minor in business administration. During his studies he also worked at and co- founded several startups (Spoker, Dartfish, GMIPSoft), taught computer science and software developed at several private and public schools. Guinard began working on the Internet of Things in 2005 with Sun Microsystems working on RFID applications. He continued studying the field with his a master's thesis at Lancaster University on Ubiquitous Computing. After graduating from university, he went on to get his PhD in Computer Science at ETH Zurich. During his time as a PhD he also worked as a Research Associate for SAP where he met Vlad Trifa. Both focused on the Internet of Things applications at SAP especially looking at the integration of real-world devices such as wireless sensor networks to business processes and enterprise software (e.g., ERPs). The complexity of these integrations at the time lead them to look for simpler integration mechanisms. In 2007 they defined an application layer for the Internet of Things that uses Web standards called the Web of Things and founded the Webofthings.org community to promote the use of Web standards in the IoT. Guinard wrote his Ph.D thesis on the Web of Things, particularly looking at the physical mashups of Things on the Web. His thesis* was granted an ETH Medal in 2012 . Towards the end of his Ph.D worked applying the Web of Things concepts to Smart Supply chains and IoT applications in manufacturing environments at the MIT Auto-ID Lab with Professor Sanjay Sarma. In 2011, Guinard co-founded EVRYTHNG together with Vlad Trifa, Niall Murphy and Andy Hobsbawm. The founding idea of EVRYTHNG was to create digital identities and Web APIs for all kinds of objects: from consumer goods to consumer electronics. As such, EVRYTHNG was the first commercial Web of Things platform. Dominique has been the CTO of EVRYTHNG since then, overseeing all the technical aspects of the platform. In 2015, Guinard co-authored the Web Thing Model which was accepted as an official W3C member submission. The Web Thing model is a first attempt at creating a simple Web based standard for the application layer of the Internet of Things. Publications Guinard published a number of scientific articles in journals and conferences covering many aspects of the Internet of Things and the Web of Things. One of his most cited publications is \\"Towards the Web of Things: Web Mashups for Embedded Devices\\" which lays the foundations for integrating everyday devices and sensors to the Web. Guinard co-authored a number of books related IoT and in particular \\"Building the Web of Things\\". This book was the first to provide an applicable step-by-step guide about how to implement Web-based smart products and applications using Node.js and the Raspberry Pi.

It was established in 2012 by Russian scientists Sergey Zimov and Nikita Zimov as a companion to Pleistocene Park in Siberia. Unlike Pleistocene Park, Wild Field‚Äôs primary purpose is not scientific research but public outreach, i.e. it will provide a model of what an unregulated steppe ecosystem looked like before the advent of humans. It is situated near a federal road and a railway station and is accessible to the general public. The reserve Wild Field comprises 300 ha (740 ac) of which at first 150 ha were fenced off and stocked with animals. In 2017 the fenced area was increased to 280 hectares. The area of the reserve will be increased to 500 ha in 2018‚Äì2019. For the future, plans call for a continuous increase of the area in relation to the increasing population of animals in the reserve. Animals Introduced between 2012 and 2015 were * Bashkir horses (a strain of Equus ferus caballus), from a feral herd in the southern part of the Ural Mountains, * Altai maral/Altai wapiti (Cervus canadensis sibiricus), * Edilbaevskaya sheep (a strain of Ovis orientalis aries), * Roe deer (Capreolus spec.), * Kalmykian cattle (a strain of Bos primigenius taurus), * Domestic yaks (Bos mutus grunniens), both polled and unpolled. The total number of large herbivores in Wild Field Park numbered around 150 in April 2015. In 2016, several wild boars (Sus scrofa) and a female elk[BE]/moose[AE] (Alces alces) entered the reserve through special one-way entrances built into the fences. Several young wild boar/domestic pig hybrids (Sus scrofa √ó domesticus) have also been purchased to be released into the park upon maturing. In 2017, four reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and 73 domestic Pridonskaya goats (a strain of Capra aegagrus hircus) were added. A herd of 20 plains bison (Bison bison bison) which was to be delivered in March 2014 by the True Nature Foundation, a European organization for ecological restoration and rewilding, could not be imported due to a blanket import ban on cattle from countries affected by the Schmallenberg virus. The introduction of a test group of camels (Camelus spec.) is under consideration. Further plans call for the introduction of bison, saiga antelopes, vultures, bobak marmots and speckled ground squirrels.

The bell tower, inspired by that of San Marco in Venice was added later, in 1929, it is home to a concert of six bells. The interior has a Latin cross with three naves, with vaulted ceilings and stained glass windows. The interior decoration dates back to the Second World War (1946-1954) and was created by Mario Prayer: the apse is depicted the triumph of the Virgin with Saints and Martyrs; many characters depicted in the decoration of the transept and the nave are taken from photographs of men and women who fell in the bombings of 19 July 1943.

He was a specialist stayer best known for his upset victory in the 1990 Ascot Gold Cup. After finishing unplaced on his only start as a two-year-old he spent the following year competing in minor races at Redcar Racecourse, winning three times. In 1990 he began his campaign by finishing second to Sadeem at Salisbury Racecourse and then won the Group Three Oleander-Rennen in Germany. At Ascot, he coped with the wet conditions better than his opponents and won the Gold Cup by four lengths. He was beaten in his three remaining races although he did finish third in the Jockey Club Cup on his final appearance. He has been described as one of the worst horses to win the Gold Cup. Background Ashal was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by Derrinstown Stud Ltd one of the breeding companies of his owner Hamdan Al Maktoum. He was sent into training with Harry Thomson Jones at Newmarket, Suffolk. Like many of the trainer's horses, he raced in a white \\"sheepskin\\" noseband. Ashal was from the third crop of foals sired by Touching Wood an American-bred stallion who was trained by Thomson Jones to win the St Leger for Hamdan Al Maktoum's older brother Maktoum Al Maktoum in 1982. Most of his offspring produced their best form over extended distance and included Great Marquess (Doncaster Cup) and Lucky Moon (Goodwood Cup). Ashal's dam Johara won one minor race in England as a two-year-old in 1981. She was a descendant of the American broodmare Grey Flight (foaled in 1945) who was the female-line ancestor of several major winners including Bold Lad, Quick As Lightning and Priolo Racing career =1988: two-year-old season= On his first and only appearance as a two-year-old Ashal started a 16/1 outsider for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Yarmouth Racecourse. Ridden as in all but one of his races by Richard Hills he was always towards the rear of the field and finished eleventh of the thirteen runners behind Warrshan (later to win the Predominate Stakes and the Gordon Stakes) beaten twelve and a half lengths by the winner. =1989: three-year-old season= Ashal's three-year-old season consisted of four races at Redcar Racecourse in Yorkshire. In 4 July he was beaten a short head by Groom Porter in a maiden over fourteen furlongs and then started 6/5 favourite for a similar event over a distance of two miles three weeks later. After taking the lead three furlongs out he went clear of the field before being eased down in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths from Kosciosko. Ashal was then off the course until October when he contested a minor race over two miles in which only one horse, a gelding named Shrraar appeared to oppose him. Starting at the unusual odds of 1/25 he took the lead half way through the \\"contest\\" and won by thirty lengths. On 10 November the colt was matched against older horses for the first time and started at odds of 5/1 in a thirteen-runner handicap race over fourteen furlongs. Carrying a weight of 122 pounds he went to the front a quarter of a mile from the finish and \\"stayed on strongly\\" to win by six lengths from the Barry Hills-trained five-year-old Sudden Victory. =1990: four-year-old season= Ashal began his third campaign at Salisbury Racecourse on 3 May in the Douglas Stakes, a minor race which nevertheless represented a major step up in class as he was matched against Sadeem, a seven-year-old who had won the last two runnings of the Ascot Gold Cup. Ridden by Nicky Carlisle he stayed on in the closing stages of the fourteen-furlong event and finished second by a neck to his older rival from whom he was receiving ten pounds in weight. Hills was back in the saddle sixteen days later when the colt was sent to Baden- Baden in Germany for the Group Three Oleander-Rennen over 3200 metres. He recorded his first major success as he won by three and a half lengths from Dance Spectrum with Glacial Storm (winner of the Prix de Barbeville, runner-up in the 1988 Epsom Derby) another three and a half lengths back in third. The 1990 edition of the Gold Cup, run over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot on 21 June attracted a field of eleven runners and took place in driving rain on ground officially described as good to soft. Teamster (Sagaro Stakes, Henry II Stakes) was made favourite ahead of Sadeem and Weld (Doncaster Cup, Jockey Club Cup) with Ashal a 14/1 outsider. The international challenge consisted of Turgeon from France and Tyrone Bridge from Ireland, whilst the other British- trained runners included the Yorkshire Cup winner Mountain Kingdom. Coping well with the difficult conditions, Ashal chased the outsider Noble Savage in the early stages before going to the front before half way. He entered the final straight with a clear advantage and never looked in serious danger of defeat, being driven out by Hills to win by four lengths from Tyrone Bridge with the outsider Thethingaboutitis taking third place. Ashal's win gave Hills his first Group One success. Much firmer ground prevailed for the rest of the season and Ashal failed to reproduce his Gold Cup form in his three subsequent races although he did carry top weight on each occasion. In the Goodwood Cup on 2 August he started second favourite but weakened in the straight and finished tailed-off behind the three-year-old Lucky Moon. He produced a better effort in the Doncaster Cup in September when he led the field until the last quarter mile but was then outpaced and finished fifth of the ten runners behind Al Maheb. In the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 October he briefly took the lead approaching the last half mile before finishing third behind Great Marquess and Dance Spectrum. Ashal did not race again and there is no record of him standing as a breeding stallion. Assessment and awards In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Ashal as the worst Gold Cup winner of the 20th century. The Independent's Sue Montgomery described Ashal's Gold Cup as a \\"terrible nadir\\" for the stayers' division.

K√∂ln: Rheinland-Verlag, 1987, p. 58. . Life and work =The early years= Weiland was born on October 14, 1944, into a pettybourgeois family in north-western Germany.See the information provided about the poet by Pavel Branko in the Slovakian literary journal Romboid: \\"Narodil sa roku 1944 v Herforde v rodine akt√≠vnych socialistov...\\". Pavel Branko, introduction to Weiland's poems, in: Romboid': literatur√°, te√≥ria, kritika; liter√°rnokritick√Ω mesacnik [literary monthly], Bratislava: Slovensk√Ω spisovatelÃï, Vol. XLIII, No. 8, 2008, S. 67.

The journal is held by the British Library, the University College London, Oxford University, and Glasgow University; it is also listed in the catalogue of the Austrian Landes-libraries (√ñsterreichische Landesbibliotheken), see: and it is also listed in the UniCat (Union Catalogue of Belgian Libraries), see: He studied American literature in Bochum, Germany.Massimo Bacigalupo wrote that Weiland graduated from Bochum University: \\"Andreas Weiland si √© laureato a Bochum con una tesi di narrativa postmoderna americana\\"; see Massimo Bacigalupo and Anna Lucia Giavotto (eds.), Critica del Novecento / Criticizing the Twentieth Century, Genova: Tilgher, 2001, p. 429. In 1967 he founded the poetry magazine Touch with Steven R. Diamant. The journal is available in the Yale University Library. .Massimo Bacigalupo called it una rivista d'avanguardia (a journal of the avant-garde).See Massimo Bacigalupo and Anna Lucia Giavotto (eds.), Critica del Novecento / Criticizing the Twentieth Century, Genova: Tilgher, 2001, p. 429. Since 1966, Weiland has translated poetry from Italian,See for instance the poem Esercizio di respirazione, that was written by the filmmaker and poet Guido Lombardi and that was published in Italian and English in the literary journal Touch # 3/4, spring 1969; the journal is available in the Bodleian Library, Oxford University. modern GreekSee his translations of poems by Embirikos, Seferis, and others that were published in the 1960s in diverse issues of the journal hellenika, Zeitschrift f√ºr deutsch-griechische kulturelle und wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit, edited by Isidora Rosenthal-Karaminea. and PortugueseSee the poems by Dante Milano and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, in Touch # 1 /1967. into English and German. He also translated and published the works of a number of \\"Angry Young Men\\", including Pete Brown, Libby Houston, Adrian Mitchell and Frances Horovitz.Prof. Fang mentions Weiland's \\" √úbersetzungen von Adrian Mitchell, Pete Brown, Francis Horovitz (...)\\"; see Weigui Fang (ed.), Den Kranich fragen, p. 346. Weilandf had a poetry reading with the British Beat poet Michael Horovitz in Bochum in the late 1960s.The short biographical note in his poetry book, The Kranenburg Poems (2003) says that \\"Weiland ‚Ä¶ had his first poetry reading with Mike Horovitz in the '60s.\\" (Andreas Weiland, The Kranenburg Poems, Rotterdam: Symposium Press 2003, p. 83). In the 1970s, he wrote a poetic text inspired by the video film Herman Dances Alone. In 1975, his poem inspired by Straub-Huillet's film \\"Moses und Aron\\" was published in the journal Cahiers du Cin√©ma. This poem was translated from German to French by Jean-Marie Straub, and appeared in the Cahiers in both languages, accompanied by the commentary \\"Il comble √† peu tous mes espoirs quant au film\\" (\\"It encompasses nearly all my hopes with regard to the film\\")See: Cahiers du Cin√©ma, n. 258-259 (juillet-ao√ªt 1975), p. 24. See ; - = Years in Taiwan = During the second half of the 1970s, Weiland worked for several years as a lecturer at the departments of German and English of a university in Taiwan.SeeJ√ºrgen Theobaldy (ed.), Und ich bewege mich doch. Gedichte vor und nach 1968. M√ºnchen: Verlag C.H. Beck, 2nd edn 1978, p. 230; and see also Massimo Bacigalupo and Anna Lucia Giavotto (eds.), Critica del Novecento / Criticizing the Twentieth Century, Genova: Tilgher, 2001, p. 429: \\"ha insegnato a Taiwan...\\". In Taiwan, he founded a journal called Ë°óÈ†≠ / Street.The price per copy was 25 N.T. (New Taiwan dollars). Twenty N.T. were worth one German Mark at the time. See the cover and back cover of the journal, reproduced in the journal Art in Society, issue 15: . This journal republished an article or articles originally published in Ë°óÈ†≠ / Street. During this period, there were many street protests against the Kuomintang (KMT) dictatorship. When Weiland published the work of two writers who had previously been imprisoned by the KMT, the government closed down the journal.The journal Art in Society, issue 15, includes this note: \\"In the summer of 1977, the bilingual (English-Chinese) journal Street / Jietou, edited by the Culture Study Group at Tamkang College in Tamshui under the direction of Wei Lan-de (=AW) published an article by the director, playwright and scholar Mei-shu HUANG on HUANG's staging of Yao Yi-wei's play \\"A Suitcase\\" ( ‰∏ÄÂè£ÁÆ±Â≠ê , Yikou xiangzi), accompanied by a review of the performance written by Andr√© Jadis. Because the journal was suppressed by the Guomindang regime subsequent to the publication of the issue focused on Yao Yi-wei, P'ai Ch'iu, Yang Kwei and others, and because hardly any libraries can be assumed to possess copies, both articles are now made accessible again in Art in Society, issue 15.\\" Source: N.N., \\"A Suitcase (‰∏ÄÂè£ÁÆ±Â≠ê ) - A Play by the Taiwan-based Chinese Playwright Yao Yi-wei ( Âßö‰∏ÄËë¶) \\", in Art in Society, issue 15, . Wei Lan-de was apparently the Chinese name of Andreas Weiland who signs some articles in Street Voice / Voces de la Calle simply with AW or aw. It is possible that Andr√© Jadis is also a pseudonym of Weiland. After all, the antiquated German word \\"weiland\\" (English: once (upon a time), Latin: olim) can be translated as \\"jadis\\" in French. According to Weiland's \\"List of Publications,\\" he published articles in Chinese magazines, including Yinxiang and Artist Magazine.See his article about the Taiwanese film I'm A Seagull\\" [ÊàëÊòØ‰∏ÄÊ≤ôÈ∑ó W«í sh√¨ yƒ´ shƒÅ'≈çu, starring ÊûóÈùíÈúû L√≠n Qƒ´ngxi√° (Brigitte Lin), Áß¶Á••Êûó Q√≠n Xi√°ngl√≠n (Chin Hsiang-lin or Charlie Chin), ÂäâÂ∞öË¨ô Liu Shangqian, , ÂäâÂ§¢Ááï Liu Mengyan, etc. ; Taiwan 1976.

Two articles published in Artist Magazine were later on republished in a small book, Day for Night in Taipei, Notes of A Cin√©aste.See: . Also: RWTH Aachen University, OPAC catalogue An article by him that was published in Yinxiang about a film by the Indonesian film director Wim Umboh has been republished in Art in Society.See: Art in Society, issue 6 (). The journal mentions that Weiland interviewed Wim Umboh in Taipei when Umboh's film Plastic Flowers, which was scheduled to be screened during the Taipei International Film Festival of 1978, was outlawed by the KMT regime. Weiland attended a private screening of the forbidden film. Weiland wrote and published articles about art and the cinema in Taiwan; his \\"List of Publications\\" also mentions a number of articles he wrote in those years about performances of the Cloud Gate Dance Theater. =The 1980s and '90s= Starting in the early 1980s, Weiland worked as a planning historian at the Department of Planning Theory of Aachen Technical University.See the PT Lehrstuhl f√ºr Planungstheorie website of RWTH Aachen University: that mentions him nowadays as a former member of the academic staff; see also an Atelierhaus Essen webpage that says: \\"lehrte und/oder forschte...an...der RWTH Aachen und der FH Aachen...\\"(i.e., taught and/or worked as a researcher at the RWTH and the FH Aachen.\\" The RWTH is the Technical University in Aachen and the FH is the university of applied sciences. As a planning historian, Weiland published a number of articles. For instance, \\"The Beginning of Modern Town Planning\\", in: Planning History Bulletin, Vol. 5, No. 3, 1983. And: \\"The 1987 Bad Homburg Symposium ‚Äì Urban Renewal Before World War I\\", in: Planning History Bulletin, Vol. 9, No. 1, 1987.

He also published a number of book reviews in the journal Planning Perspectives (ISSN 0266-5433). An interdisciplinary article that crossed the boundary between urbanistics and discourse theory appeared in J√ºrgen Link's journal kultuRRevolution.See Andreas Weiland, \\"R√ºckeroberung der Peripherie durch das Zentrum: √ñkonomische Tendenzen, diskursive Praktiken\\", in: Polarit√§ten im Flu√ü, Sonderheft der Zeitschrift kultuRRevolution; edited by J√ºrgen Link et al. (Bochum), No. 30, 1994. This journal also published a number of his poems.See his List of publications.\\" He continued to write poetry and to corresponded with poets, among them J√ºrgen Theobaldy,see the correspondence between J√ºrgen Theobaldy and Andreas Weiland that is archived in Switzerland: ; the dates given online are: (correspondence with:) Weiland, Andreas, (location of Weiland:) Bochum; Aachen; (period of correspondence:) 1974-01-20/200712; 4 boxes; and see: . Erich FriedErich Fried had written to Weiland in 1981; \\"For a long time, I have not seen poems that I considered to be so good and important\\", referring to Weiland's poems. In German: \\"Ich habe schon seit langer Zeit nicht mehr Gedichte gesehen (unveroeffentlichte oder neuerdings veroeffentlichte), die ich fuer so gut und so wichtig halte. Ich meine wichtig, weil sie unsere nicht nur literarische Landschaft bereichern. Dichten ist nicht so sehr eine literarische wie eine menschliche Betaetigung.\\" Mentioned in Weiland's homepage.

Included is a photo of Corman with the handwriting of, probably, his wife Shizumi Corman that says, \\"This picture (is the) last (one taken of) Cid / 2003 December 10th.\\" When Weiland read his poetry, it was often in the context of art exhibitions, for example at the Villa Ichon cultural center in Bremen in 1986 in conjunction with Wilfried (\\"Willi\\") Seeba's exhibition.See: . In Aachen, he read his poems in the Karm√°n Auditory during an event organized for him by Peter Klein of the renowned Buchhandlung Backhaus that also invited such poets as Volker Braun.Those who attended (like I did), will remember that the hall was packed by an amazing number of poetry lovers, and that the response was very positive, even though two Aachen-based poets made critical remarks. And he read his poems in this university town when he was invited to so during the exhibitions of artists such as Lui Rummlerhttp://www.art-in- society.de/AS1/images/LUI-RUMMLER.pdf and Peter Lacroix. Weiland also participated in the art projects and exhibition of the Canadian painter and printmaker Angelo Evelyn during the 1980s. In addition to reading his poems during single exhibitions of Evelyn, he wrote the text for Evelyn's catalogue \\"Burning Cloud and Other Themes\\" when the artist had a big exhibition in the RhoK (Flemish art academy) in Brussels in 1987.See the catalogue Angelo Evelyn: Burning Cloud and other themes, n.p.

Freiheit, Gleichheit, Br√ºderlichkeit heute, Museum Bochum, 1989, p. 121. . With Fang Weigui, Weiland translated 155 poems that were written by the ancient Chinese poet Bai Juyi.Weigui Fang (eds), Den Kranich fragen. 155 Gedichte von Bai Juyi. Aus dem Chinesischen √ºbersetzt von Weigui Fang und Andreas Weiland. G√∂ttingen: Cuivillier Verlag 1999. . The book, which was published in G√∂ttingen in 1999, was positively reviewed by Karl-Heinz Pohl (sinologue, Trier University) and by Wolfgang Kubin (poet and sinologue, Bonn and Beijing).Wolfgang Kubin, \\"Weigui Fang (ed.), Den Kranich fragen. 155 Gedichte von Bai Juyi.

The new poems read during the event were inspired by works of Evelyn. They appeared in print in 2003.See: Andreas Weiland, The Kranenburg Poems with 28 reproductions of art works by Evelyn. Aachen and Rotterdam: Symposium Press, 2nd edition 2004, . The book was reviewed positively in the South German daily newspaper Donaukurier. See klf, \\"Dichtung, die dem Maler auf die Spur kommt\\", Donaukurier, July 30, 2004. Weiland also read recently written poetry in the context of a series of events curated by the artist Li Portenl√§nger.See for example \\"An einem ganz besonderen Ort\\", an article in the daily newspaper Donaukurier, June 29, 2010, . And In one case, the result was a small poetry book with an original lithographic art work by Portenl√§nger.This artist book, with an original lithographic art work by Li Portenl√§nger, was entitled h√∂hle haus pfad / himmel berg flu√ü wald; it was printed in 2010 by Siegfried H√∂llriegl in Meran. The long title had been predetermined by Portenl√§nger's Eichst√§tt art project that was situated in many locations of the public space of this town. The book contains seven poems with, in part, a Peruvian theme (the sendero or \\"path\\"), and in part, a Mexican sujet. Volker Braun commented that he \\"like(d) the subjet matter, Oaxaca, and the man\\" who chose to write about it (\\"mir gef√§llt das Thema, und der Mann\\"). The writer Michael Kleinherne, author of a collection of short stories, called the poems mythical during a public debate in Eichst√§tt. The book was presented to the public in Eichst√§tt. The South German dailyDonaukurier reported that an audience listened to Weiland's poems during a poetry reading that took place in the Southern tower of the Eichst√§tt Cathedral. See: \\"An einem ganz besonderen Ort,\\" in: Donaukurier, June 29, 2016. Weiland participated in collective art and literature projects such as the project \\"Erfahren/Erinnern\\" (Figurenfeld Project, Eichst√§tt, Germany), together with Li Portenl√§nger, Luc Piron, and Angelo Evelyn,See Donaukurier, November 4, 2005, and November 16, 2005; the Figurenfeld Project resulted in a large exhibition in the Catholic University of Eichst√§tt, poetry readings, an artist book of the four participants, and a film by the Gent-based filmmaker Karin Mels that shows Weiland reading his long poem written on the occasion of the project and published in the artist book. A third article on the Figurenfeld Project appeared in the Donaukurier on January 12, 2006. The artist book was not only presented to the public in Eichst√§tt but also archived by the lithography collection of the university.

Weiland's cooperation with Piron resulted in a number of artist books with Piron's art works and Weiland's poems.See the poet's \\"List of publications\\" Weiland wrote also poetic commentaries on the paintings of modern Arab artists like Maurice Haddad from IraqSee Art in Society, No. 1, ISSN 1618-2154. and, while apparently using a pseudonym, about the Egyptian painter Saad el Girgawi. In 2009, Weiland participated in a conference about the Contemporary Arab Contribution to World Culture at the UNESCO in Paris that was organized by the president of the IAIS.

Plot Gloria (Sofia Vergara), Phil (Ty Burrell), and Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) reveal that being married to a Pritchett is not always easy which is the reason why they formed an alliance against their judgmental spouses. Gloria helps Cameron to get rid of two Russian guests who are refusing to leave the rented upstairs unit and Cameron and Phil conspire to hide the evidence of the electric shock collar which Gloria has bought for Stella against Jay's wishes. This scheme backfires when Phil triggers the electric shock collar he has hidden on his person, and Manny (Rico Rodriguez) discovers that orange juice Gloria was supposed to buy (and which also the code for the alliance) is missing from the fridge, arousing Mitchell's suspicions. A widow at the country club becomes infatuated with Luke (Nolan Gould) and Jay tries to take advantage of the situation by getting her to sign a petition to allow cigar smoking inside the club.

Formed in 1962, the organization is a founding member of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters. This organization addresses the issue of racial discrimination faced by African- American firefighters in the United States. The Valiants is descended from the Vulcan Society of the Fire Department of New York, a fraternal order of black firefighters organized in 1940 to promote diversity and aid minority recruitment to the ranks of civil servants. History Philadelphia Fire Lieutenant Samuel Singleton organized the Valiants in March 1962, as a counterpart to other \\"fraternals\\" recognized by the Philadelphia Fire Department, such as the Sons of Italy, \\"The Lambskins\\" (Masons), \\"The League of Sacred Heart\\", and \\"The Shomrim\\" Society. These were typically organized around religious or ethnic affinities, and did not welcome blacks. The Philadelphia Fire Department had had African-American firefighters since 1886, but fire companies were segregated (though with white officers in the black companies) until 1952. Before 1952, there were only two black fire companies. After 1952, African-Americans began entering the Philadelphia Fire Department in greater numbers, but integration often resulted in racial animosity and tension. The Valiants originally formed to hold dinners and bring their families together. Al Means and Howard Rhone were the first co-presidents. Realizing they had more to do, the Valiants began reaching out to the younger recruits, performing fire prevention outreach to the minority community and volunteering at charity functions. Formation of International Association of Black Professional Firefighters Along with the Vulcan Society of New York City, the Phoenix Society of Hartford, the Vulcans of Hudson County, New Jersey, and the Vulcans of New Jersey, the Valiants participated in a 1969 conference in New York City, which led to the formation of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters in 1970. This group aimed to combat the racism which was endemic within American fire services, and increase minority recruitment efforts and hiring. Charles Hendricks, the Valiants' first treasurer, became the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters' treasurer. Valiant William Brogden was selected first recording secretary, and Valiant Ron Lewis served as regional head for of the Northeast. As of 2017, the Valiants are the largest group in the 8,000-strong International Association of Black Professional Firefighters. Consent decree In 1973 a brief study of hiring and promotional practices performed by the City of Philadelphia revealed a pattern of discrimination. The Valiants filed lawsuits to change the hiring practices of the Philadelphia Fire Department, which led to a consent decree in 1975, under which the department operated until the decree was stayed by a court in 2011, a total of 36 years. Under the decree, the department undertook to promote more black firemen to the upper ranks, and to increase recruitment and hiring of minorities. By 2011, when the consent decree was stayed, Derrick Sawyer, an African-American, was leading the 2,100-strong department as Fire Commissioner. The Valiants continue to monitor hiring of firefighters and EMS personnel. In 2011, the group brought a discrimination lawsuit against the firefighters' union International Association of Fire Fighters or IAFF, and the City of Philadelphia, alleging persistent discrimination and fostering of a \\"hostile work environment\\". The lawsuit was settled, with black firefighters gaining greater participation in IAFF Local 22 activities, and the ability to run for office in the union. Promotions Members of the Valiants have risen through the ranks and have attained promotions to the upper echelons of the Fire Department. The first African-American Fire Commissioner of the City of Philadelphia was Harold B. Hairston, a member of the Valiants and the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters. Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers served as President and also Director of the Northeast Region of the International Association of Black Professional Firefighters. In 1984, Deputy Commissioner Donald Patton was the first African-American to achieve that distinction. He also served as President of the Valiants. A scholarship in his name is awarded each year by the organization to a student as a memorial to the Deputy Commissioner, who was passionate about education. Among other Valiants who excelled were Deputy Chief Al Nelson; Battalion Chiefs Earnest Hargett, Jr. and Norman Ray; Captain Clarence Brogden; Lieutenants Lisa Forrest, Berry Hutchins, Eric Johnson, Larry Clark, and Eric Stukes; and the Valiants' founding member, Charles Hendricks.  City Council proclamation  In 2013, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Valiants, the City Council of the City of Philadelphia adopted a resolution honoring them for 50 years of work for racial justice.

He was grandson of Servius Cornelius Maluginensis, consul in 485 BC.Fasti Capitolini According to Livy,Livy, Ab urbe condita III. 40 and Dionysius of Halicarnassus,Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, XI. 16 he was the brother of Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis Uritus Cossus (consul in 459 BC) but his name would be the same as his father if we refer to the filiation given by the Fasti Capitolini. Biography Marcus Cornelius Maluginensis was one of the ten members of the Second Decemvirate, presided over by Appius Claudius Crassus and elected for the purpose of drafting the Law of the Twelve Tables, first written law of the Roman Republic. At the instigation of Appius Claudius, the decemvirs illegally held onto power the following year, refusing to proceed with the election of consuls.Cicero, De Republica, II. 61 That year, a war escalated with the Sabines who were based in Eretum and the Aequi camped under Mount Algidus. The Roman troops were divided into two armies so that they could fight on two fronts. Marcus Cornelius received the command of the army that fought the Aequi, with three other decemvirs; Lucius Minucius, Titus Antonius, and Lucius Sergius. Meanwhile, Appius Claudius and Spurius Oppius Cornicen remained in Rome to ensure the defence of the city, and the four other decemvirs fought against the Sabines.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 38-42Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, XI. 2 The two Roman armies were kept in check on each front. The army commanded by Marcus Cornelius had withdrawn to Tusculum then moved in response to the call from Lucius Verginius, whose daughter had been enslaved by Appius Claudius. As a result of Appius Claudius' conduct during the ensuing trial, Lucius Verginius had decided to kill his own daughter. His story provoked a mutiny of the soldiers who elected twelve military tribunes. Under their command, they returned to Rome and set up camp on the Aventine and were then joined by the other Roman army that was led by Appius Claudius and Spurius Oppius Cornicen. Appius Claudius and Spurius Oppius Cornicen were imprisoned in Rome, but committed suicide during their prosecution.

Description and history The F.W. Wheeler House stands on the south side of Intervale Street, a residential side street in the village of Richford. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a symmetrical appearance that is still characterized by details typical of the Queen Anne period, better known for its asymmetrical designs. The main roof ridge runs parallel to the street, with lower gable sections projecting to the front and sides at each end. A porch extends between the front-facing projections, supported by turned posts, and there are similar porches on the sides. The interiors of the two units are organized as mirror images of each other, and retain original woodwork, wrought iron heating grates, and other features. with The house was built in 1904 for F.W. Wheeler, a native of Bristol, Vermont who had established a photography business in the bustling border town. It is unclear if Wheeler had it built as a rental property or if he occupied one of its units. The house is unusual because most of Richford's housing stock of the period was modestly scaled single-family units. The house's design matches in some details a pattern for a single-family residence published by the Radford Architectural Company in 1898.

There are also traces of Jesuits and cattle drovers from the colonial era. History The Guartel√° State Park was created by decree 1,229 of 27 March 1992 to protect an area of rich natural and archaeological heritage in the region of the Iap√≥ River canyon. The park was created by Governor Roberto Requi√£o. The governor who succeeded him reduced its size by 90%. It was implemented in 1997. It is managed by the Government of the State of Paran√° with the objective of preserving the ecosystems typical of the region, the area's natural environment, including canyons, springs, waterfalls and native flora and fauna, caves and archaeological and prehistoric sites, including rock paintings, and of regulating tourism in the areas. It is administered by the Environmental Institute of Paran√° (IAP). As of 2015 the park was receiving about 1,700 visitors per month, more than twice as many as ten years earlier. Environment The Guartel√° Canyon is considered the 6th largest canyon in the world, and the only one with native vegetation. The French naturalist Augustin Saint-Hilaire (1779‚Äì1853) calledit the \\"terrestrial paradise of Brazil\\".

However, he started his professional football career by Racing Besan√ßon in the 1977‚Äì78 French Division 2.

In the 1981 Coppa delle Alpi final against Sochaux, which ended 2‚Äì2 and Basel won in the penalty shootout, Gaisser scored one goal and successfully converted his penalty. In the 1979 Uhrencup final (4-1 win against Grenchen) Gaisser also scored a goal. He stayed in Basel for four seasons. Gaisser transferred to Mulhouse before the start of the 1983‚Äì84 French Division 2 season. He played three seasons for Mulhouse before he transferred to Concordia Basel to end his football career.

They were each listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994, in listings that included street numbers current to that period. 439 Pearl Street 439 Pearl Street 439 Pearl Street (formerly 74 Pearl Street) is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its styling is relatively modest, with plain cornerboards, and porches supported by Tuscan columns mounted above shingled half-walls. The most elaborate element is a cross gable on the main portion of the building, which has a Queen Anne-style lattice screen at the peak of the gable, and a recessed window below. The interior retains original woodwork and other features, although it is not particularly elaborate. with 447 Pearl Street 447 Pearl Street (formerly 76 Pearl Street) is, like its neighbor, a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a gabled roof. Its exterior is distinguished from the other by its projecting polygonal bays, which are topped by turreted roofs, and the turned posts and spindled friezes of its porches. The interior retains many original features, and has a particularly elaborate main staircase. with History The lots for these two houses were subdivided in 1892 from a parcel that housed the local jail. They were purchased in 1893 by Virginia Benoit, widow of a local barber. Maps of the period show that #439 was completed by 1894, and that construction of #447 was underway in 1900. In a 1904-05 directory of the town, Virginia Benoit was listed as being resident at #447, along with other family members. In 1912, they were sold to Edgar Roy, a blacksmith. Both houses remained in common ownership, and were eventually acquired by the local housing authority, which rehabilitated them in the 1990s.

According to Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian, Viriatus came from Lusitania, that is, from ancient Portugal. He became the leader of an army and remained invincible for a long time. The Romans could not defeat him in any battle, so they decided to assassinate him. He was stabbed to death during his sleep. Only then did Iberia become a Roman province.

Origins The stadium was constructed on the west side of Nicholas Lane and was surrounded entirely by three railway lines. The Highgate colliery was nearby to the east. History The area contained a strong mining community and attracted patronage from nearby Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley. In the 1970s racing was held on Tuesday evenings and Saturday afternoons over 340 and 450 yards. It was an all-grass track and was described as a good galloping track with wide easy bends and an 'Inside Sumner' hare system. By the late 1980s the circumference was 440 metres with race distances of 260, 304, 414, 590 and 740 metres. The track was sand with racing on Monday, Thursday and Saturday evenings. In 2008 the track was featured in a BBC documentary called 'The flapping track'. The official programme preview was listed as \\"The story of South Yorkshire's Highgate Greyhound Stadium, which each week attracts a motley crowd of characters to the world of flapping - independent, unregulated greyhound racing\\". Until March 2019 racing took place every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday. Facilities include a stadium cafe, a fully licensed bar and fast food area. It is one of only five independent (unaffiliated to a governing body) tracks remaining today. On 26 March 2019 the management of the stadium announced via their official Facebook page that greyhound racing at the stadium had been suspended forn the foreseeable future due to a lack of entries from trainers aside from those who were long-term affiliated with the stadium.

He also served for four years as Governor of the Greek island of Zante Biography Moore was born in Dublin (or possibly at Tinraheen) to Lorenzo Moore, the son of John Moore and Maryann, daughter of Lorenzo Moore (born c. 1722 at Tinraheen). Moore entered the Army as ensign in the 61st Regiment of Foot, and from thence until he ceased doing regimental duty ‚Äî a period of 42 years ‚Äî he never sought leave of absence from his corps, except when compelled by severe ill-health. Moore embarked no less than twelve different times on foreign service in various quarters of the globe ‚Äî in the East Indies, Egypt, the Cape of Good Hope, the Mediterranean, and in the West Indies twice. In the year 1798 Moore was severely wounded at the Capture of St. Lucia: and his constitution was so shaken at that early period of his life, by the combined effects of his wound and the West Indian climate, that he seldom ceased to feel the effects of them. Yet he never suffered himself to yield to the lassitude usually attendant on such occasions, but manfully struggling against it, and sustained by a strong sense of the soldier's duty, his military spirit carried him through all fatigues, and enabled him to acquire a character so high as to recommend him for quick promotion, and secure to him the approbation and confidence of three of England's most highly thought of Generals of the day, namely. Sir John Moore, on whose personal staff he served in Ireland in the year 1798; he was subsequently appointed to the staff of Sir Charles, afterwards Earl Grey; and lastly to that of Sir Hildebrand Oakes. In the Mediterranean Moore commanded the only British regiment (the 35th) employed in the capture of the Ionian Islands; and so distinguished was his conduct in the progress of military operations there, that during the siege of the strong fortress of Saint Maure, he was thrice thanked in Public Orders‚Äîthe last of these called forth by a brilliant achievement, deemed nearly impracticable at the time, whereby with a force scarcely one-third of that opposed to him, he carried by assault their last position in front, and within point-blank range of their fortress, and so strengthened it during the night, as to enable him effectually to resist the full fire of the batteries from daylight to midday, when the enemy were compelled to surrender. Moore was subsequently appointed head of the provisional government and Commandant in the island of Zante, which he held for four years, and by his judicious and conciliating conduct so gained the esteem and regard of the inhabitants, as to call forth a flattering testimony of their feelings in requesting permission for the island to become sponsor to one of his children, born during his government there. In the year 1834 Moore was honoured by William IV with the investiture of the Guelphic Order, as a Knight Commander, having previously been made a Companion of the Bath (CB). Family Sir Lorenzo Moore married Eliza Sophia (c. 1779‚Äì1849), the eldest daughter of the Morley Wharrey, of Selby, Yorkshire, on 13 July 1808 at Barfreston.

The expedition set out in February 1595 to explore the Orinoco River on the northeast tip of South America in an attempt to find the fabled city of El Dorado.Sellin, pp. 228‚Äì231. Raleigh first captured the Spanish settlement of San Jos√© de Oru√±a on the colony of Trinidad, along with the Governor Antonio de Berr√≠o, who was also looking for the city. After questioning De Berr√≠o, Raleigh and the English held the place and used it as a base for their exploration.Aronson, pp. 127‚Äì128. Despite the presence of a Spanish force shadowing him, Raleigh successfully navigated the river and inlets, penetrating some into the Guiana highlands.Nicholl, pp. 156‚Äì158. No gold or lost city was ever found, however Raleigh returned to England and subsequently exaggerated his account.Marley, p. 132. Still, the expedition resulted in an important alliance with the natives of the region, which would have a lasting impact on future colonization of the area. Background Sir Walter Raleigh With England at war with Spain in 1585, English privateers had set out to raid Spanish and Portuguese possessions and shipping, and conduct illicit trading. Sir Walter Raleigh had enjoyed several years of high esteem from Queen Elizabeth I, which stemmed in part from his previous exploits at sea which included the famous Capture of the Madre de Deus. Soon after, however, Raleigh suffered a short imprisonment for secretly marrying one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting, Elizabeth Throckmorton, and bearing her a child.Black, Joseph. \\"Sir Walter Ralegh.\\" The Broadview Anthology of British Literature. 2nd ed. Vol. 1. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2009. 334. Print. In a bid to restore his influence with the Queen, Raleigh, having promised stuff \\"gold-rich empire more lucrative than Peru\\", had set up an expedition under John Whiddon to find the fabled city of gold known as El Dorado, following one of the many old maps which indicated the putative existence of the city. Raleigh aimed to reach Lake Parime in the highlands of Guyana (the supposed location of the city at the time).Ishmael, pp. 39‚Äì41. Raleigh's fascination began when he captured Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, the Spanish governor of Patagonia, in a raid in 1586, who, despite Spain's official policy of keeping all navigational information secret, shared his maps with English cartographers.Quanchi (2005). Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands, p. 221. The biggest discovery was Gamboa's account of Juan Martinez de Albujar, who had taken part in Pedro de Silva's expedition to the area in 1570, only to fall into the hands of the Caribs of the Lower Orinoco.Elliott, p. 227. Martinez claimed that he was taken to the golden city blindfolded and was entertained by the natives, then left the city but could not remember how to return, only remembering a large lake which was nearby.Eliane Dotson, \\"Lake Parime and the Golden City.\\" Raleigh wanted to find the mythical city, which he suspected was an actual native Indian city named Manoa near a large lake called Parime. In addition, he hoped to establish an English presence in the Southern Hemisphere that could compete with that of the Spanish and to try to reduce commerce between the natives and Spaniards by forming alliances. Whiddon sailed to the island of Trinidad in 1594 and was greeted by Antonio de Berr√≠o, the Spanish governor of the island (which had only been established in 1592), and Mar√≠a de Oru√±a (niece of Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada). When questions were raised about El Dorado, De Berr√≠o got angry and ordered the execution of the small English party, but Whiddon was allowed to leave to tell the tale to Raleigh. Raleigh immediately organised an expedition in late 1594, of which the first goal was to try and capture de Berr√≠o, who was using the island for the purpose of the exploration of the Orinoco River. The expedition consisted of four ships: the Lion's Whelp under Captain George Giffard, a small Spanish prize named Gallego captained by Lawrence Kemys, Raleigh's own flagship under Captain Jacob Whiddon and Master John Douglas, and a small bark under Captain Cross. On board were 150 officers, soldiers as well as gentleman volunteers.Wallace, pp. 111‚Äì112. Another two expeditions were hoping to join in. The first expedition, under Robert Dudley and George Popham, had left earlier and the second, led by George Somers and Amyas Preston, left a month later.Bradley, p. 113. Expedition Raleigh left Plymouth on 6 February 1595, and sailed towards the Azores to take on fresh supplies before the crossing of the Atlantic. Having successfully done so Raleigh was sailing near the Canary Islands where off Tenerife a Spanish ship was captured; the cargo was emptied of which a large amount of firearms was taken. A day later a Flemish ship was captured its cargo too being emptied ‚Äì 20 hogsheads of Spanish wine.Stebbing, pp. 112‚Äì114. Raleigh arrived in the Caribbean in late March but had lost contact with two other consorts during the transatlantic crossing and failed to rendezvous with either. The first expedition under Dudley and Popham, who had waited and only departed from the area around 9 February. Between them they had captured many Spanish ships giving them an excuse to head back to England with their prizes. At the same time the Preston Somers Expedition headed further West in a way to distract the Spanish from Raleigh's expedition. They too were supposed to meet up but had also missed the rendezvous. Instead they continued with their expedition and headed towards La Guaira and Coro where they successfully raided. Their greatest prize was when they took Caracas in a daring assault having crossed a pass through the mountains. =Capture of Trinidad= Sir Walter Raleigh's raid on the island of Trinidad in 1595. The captured Spanish Governor, Antonio de Berr√≠o, is being escorted. Engraving by Theodore de Bry. Raleigh had planned to descend on the Spanish colony of Trinidad ‚Äì in particular the principal settlement of San Jos√© de Oru√±a, founded by Berrio in 1592. First of all he landed and explored the south of the island Raleigh found that the Indians were cultivating good quality tobacco and sugar cane. While sailing across the Gulf of Paria he reputedly smelled tar, and put into shore at Terra de Brea. The Caribs led Raleigh to a pitch lake (the largest of the world's three natural asphalt lakes) and he realized that the substance was ideal for caulking his ships. He took several barrels with him, and has since been credited with \\"discovering\\" the lake.Sellin, p. 222. Raleigh's principal objective was to capture the Spanish governor who was also looking for the same fabled city, question him and gain as much information before he continued his expedition. On 4 April Raleigh disembarked a hundred soldiers and seized the small stockade at Puerto de Espa√±a overwhelming the small Spanish garrison before pushing inland with the intent to capture San Jos√© de Oru√±a. After arriving just before the town surprise was well on the English side. A night time assault was launched that lasted no more than an hour and the garrison of almost fifty men were put to the sword. The Spanish general Mayor Alvaro Jorge, was captured and taken prisoner but the real prize was the Governor de Berrio. He soon begged the place to be spared and Raleigh agreed and kept the town to use it as a temporary base for an exploration of the Orinoco river.Sellin, p. 19. Raleigh also released five native Indian chiefs whom Berrio had bound with one long chain, tortured, and left to starve.Jacob Adrien Van Heuvel, El Dorado: Being a Narrative of the Circumstances which Gave Rise to Reports, in the Sixteenth Century, of the Existence of a Rich and Splendid City in South America, to which that Name was Given, and which Led to Many Enterprises in Search of it; Including a Defence of Sir Walter Raleigh, in Regard to the Relations Made by Him Respecting It, and a Nation of Female Warriors, in the Vicinity of the Amazon, in the Narrative of His Expedition to the Oronoke in 1595, J. Winchester, 1844. A fort was built in case of any Spanish counterattack while his quest to find the supposed city of El Dorado was to begin. Raleigh interrogated de Berrio and was told what he knew about Manoa and El Dorado, but then tried to discourage the Englishman from continuing on his quest, but his warnings were in vain. =Orinoco River basin= On April 15, Raleigh set out from his base in the Gallego, which was cut down for river travel, with a hundred men along with two wherries. They had provisions for nearly a month but they had to set out as quickly as possible ‚Äì they had heard rumors of a massive Spanish expedition to the area. This rumor turned out to be true; a Spanish force led by a Captain Felipe de Santiago, one of Berrio's trusted officers, with a number of canoes set out from his base at Margarita Island and attempted to shadow Raleigh's expedition.Sellin, pp. 94‚Äì97. The English entered the Orinoco river basin but the waters were sometimes too shallow and thus the Gallego was modified even more to compensate; and in addition a few rafts were built to reduce weight. As they went further through the river, a myriad of waterways opened up but Raleigh and his men made their way upriver first travelling down the Manamo river.Aronson, pp. 131‚Äì133. As the expedition headed further and further Raleigh and his men soon began to suffer from the heat and tropical rains. As the jungle got denser the crew had to hack their way through but a few men became bewildered, including an Indian guide by the name of Ferdinando who vanished, either having escaped or being captured by local natives. Raleigh however soon came across an Indian village where they procured not only a guide but also fish, bread, and fowl. He set off again and the jungle became less dense. Within a few days the savanna country of the Orinoco valley was revealed. Morale was boosted among the crew ‚Äì one of them, a negro, decided to swim but was devoured by a crocodile in full view of the men.Wallace, pp. 113‚Äì114. Raleigh noted in horror of this event which shook the crew and then realized the river here was teeming with the reptiles and ordered his crew not to take any chances. Panorama of the Orinoco in the savanna region =Spanish surprise attack= On April 27, the Spanish under Santiago, who were still shadowing Raleigh's expedition, decided to surprise the English when their rear echelon became separated after getting fresh water. Having sent the four canoes they crept up on the English but surprise was lost when they became trapped in a narrow channel in a bend in the river. The English, although surprised, quickly took advantage and Gifford with his boats launched an attack on the Spanish, who overpowered them. The Spanish had a number of casualties compared to the English, who were without loss, and the remainder fled into the woods. Gifford then took the boats as prizes. Raleigh and the rest of the boats having heard shots and shouts came up and forced the remaining two Spanish canoes to disappear from sight. Raleigh sent a small force of men to chase the Spanish who also fled into the woods. The English troops caught up with three Indians whom they captured and they begged for their lives, one of whom agreed to be their guide. Santiago after this defeat decided to give up, and returned to his base at Margarita Island. The captured Spanish canoes had much needed food and supplies which were put to good use, but also found were tools for finding various types of ores. =Caroni river to Mount Roraima= Map showing the long Caroni river A day later Raleigh's expedition soon came across a large confluence of the river. This was the Caroni River. Here Raleigh encountered the indigenous Amerindians; first the Warao people and the Pemons. After showing their victory over the Spaniards by presenting a captured Spanish canoe, the English successfully established peaceful relations with them.Nicholls & Williams, p. 104. A large village was found, possibly near present-day Ciudad Guayana, ruled by an aged chieftain named Topiawari ‚Äì Raleigh made friends by announcing that he was an enemy of the Spanish, who were widely detested by the natives.Sellin, pp. 162‚Äì166. Topiawari told Raleigh of a rich culture living in the mountains who easily convinced himself that the culture was an offshoot of the rich Inca culture of Peru and that it must be the fabled city of Manoa.Aronson, pp. 137‚Äì139. Raleigh left two of his men to become hostages and Raleigh took Topiawari's son in return.Wallace, pp. 115‚Äì116. With this friendship an alliance was forged with them against the Spaniards. Some of the ships stayed at the village to replenish for the voyage home while Raleigh and Kemys continued on with Topiawari's son as a guide. They went up the Caron√≠ River, sending out scouts to look for gold and mines, all the while making alliances with any natives they encountered. His scouts brought back rocks, hoping that further analysis would reveal gold ore. As they pushed further Raleigh noted a change on the landscape and described a tepuy (table top mountain). He saw and recorded the largest, Mount Roraima, its summit area bounded on all sides by cliffs rising . In addition, Raleigh observed around twelve waterfalls but noted the largest \\"higher than any church spire\\" he had seen‚Äîthey disembarked and walked on foot to get a closer view and described the surrounding area as the most beautiful he had seen. There could be a claim that Raleigh may have been the first European to view Angel Falls, although these claims are considered farfetched. By this time the expedition had traveled nearly inland and the rainy season had begun. Raleigh decided he had done enough, and gave the order to turn back. They returned to Topiawari's village, whose son agreed to come back to England with Raleigh, who christened him Gualtero.Aronson, pp. 140‚Äì142. Having joined the other crew left there, Raleigh set off back to Trinidad but on his way learnt from a cacique of a gold mine near Mount Iconuri and sent Lawrence Keymis with a small detachment to investigate. Keymis neared the place, which was actually a few miles from Santo Tomas; he observed a large waterfall (today Llovizna Falls) and though he did not see the mine, by the quality of quartz rock he saw and kept, he warranted that the place was of value.Wallace, p. 118. Mount Roraima in the Guiana highlands =Return to Trinidad= Raleigh returned to San Jose and remarkably, apart from the crocodile attack, he had lost no men to disease; in fact his crew was fairly healthy, partly because of the native Indian diet. As he arrived at the fort the decision was made to return to England but before doing so everything of value was taken from the place and it was burnt to the ground despite de Berr√≠o's protests. Raleigh landed on Margarita Island and successfully plundered for supplies and then landed at the port of Cuman√°, where he left de Berr√≠o ashore after he was unable to get a ransom. He finally descended upon Riohacha, which he also sacked and plundered.Stebbing, pp. 119‚Äì120. On July 13, Raleigh finally met up with Preston and Somers and was told of their remarkable exploits in capturing Caracas, La Guaira, and Coro. Contrary winds forced them to abandon the idea of seeking the colony of Roanoke and all arrived in England by the end of August 1595.Nichols & Williams, pp. 108‚Äì109. Aftermath and consequences Raleigh arrived in England but he was received with lackluster praise. Cecil was disappointed with the lack of booty and gold considering he had invested so much in the expedition. A London Alderman had the rocks examined and considered them worthless even though they contained reliable assays of gold. He was accused by others that he had hidden the gold in remote regions in Devon and Cornwall. With these claims Raleigh was infuriated and decided to then write and publish an overblown account of the expedition under the title of The Discovery of rich and beautiful empire of Guiana, a work that somewhat exaggerated the whole region. Despite this, the book became popular not just in England but France and the Netherlands. Raleigh sent Kemys back to Guyana the following year to check up on the hostages and to renew the alliance with the native Indians. He also needed to map the Orinoco, record the Amerindian tribes, and prepare geographical, geological, and botanical reports of the country. Kemys this time went much further inland along the banks of the Essequibo River and reached what he wrongly believed to be Lake Parime. He wrote about the coast of Guiana in detail in his Relation of the Second Voyage to Guiana after his return.John Knox Laughton, \\"Kemys, Lawrence\\" Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 30. De Berr√≠o the same year also set out with a Spanish expedition of his own with 470 men under command of Domingo de Vera Ibargoyen to search for El Dorado. As they advanced further inland however the Amerindians, now allied to England, attacked and destroyed Vera and Berrio's entire force losing 350 men. The rest tried to retreat but soon after disease and famine reduced the survivors to only a handful of men. After being released from prison by order of King James I in 1617, Raleigh returned to continue his quest for El Dorado on a second expedition but was to avoid any conflict with the Spanish. Along with Kemys and his son, Watt Raleigh, they were to have another search for the supposed gold mine at Mount Iconuri. However, Raleigh by now ill stayed behind in a camp on the island of Trinidad. Kemys remounted the Orinoco river and Watt was killed in a battle with the Spaniards as they destroyed and sacked the Spanish settlement at Santo Tome de Guayana. No gold was found and Kemys, disheartened by this and feeling responsible for the death of Walter's son, subsequently committed suicide.John Hemming, The Search For El Dorado, Phoenix Press; 2nd ed. December 31, 2001; Ch. 10. In fact, Kemys had already informed Raleigh by letter of the unfolding disaster and the death of his son. He went to Raleigh's cabin to beg forgiveness, but found Raleigh unable to grant him this. In Raleigh's words \\"I told him that he had undone me by his obstinacy, and that I would not favour... in any sort his former follie\\". Kemys reportedly replied \\"I know then, Sir, what course to take,\\" before returning to his own cabin. Kemys then committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest with a pistol, then when that did not prove immediately fatal, stabbing himself in the heart with a knife. Upon Raleigh's return to England, King James ordered him to be beheaded for disobeying orders to avoid conflict with the Spanish.Drye, Willie. National Geographic. El Dorado Legend Snared Sir Walter Raleigh. He was executed in 1618. In 1713, Spain and Great Britain signed the Treaty of Utrecht, whereby the latter pledged to respect the Spanish territories occupied in America. With the aggression of the Indians towards Spain, the Spanish never returned in force particularly and this allowed other European countries (France and Holland as well as England) to colonize the area over the next two centuries with the creations of Dutch Guyana, French Guiana, and eventually British Guyana after 1796 when the Essequibo (part of the Dutch Guyana) was taken by the English, who had initiated the massive introduction of settlers and slaves for their plantations. By the early 19th century, as more explorers came to the region, Lake Parime's existence was definitively disproved and there was a theory that the seasonal flooding of the Rupununi savannah may have been misidentified as such.

The gold mine at El Callao (Venezuela), started in 1871 a few miles south of Orinoco River, was for a time one of the richest in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving an appearance of almost creating an English colony on Venezuelan territory.

It is open to the public from 4:30 am to 10 pm 7 days a week. History The temple was erected at the Anping Ferry in 1668, on the site that is now occupied by Anping District's Shih-Men Primary School.. Erected soon after Koxinga's successful invasion of Dutch Taiwan in the name of the Southern Ming resistance to the Qing Empire, it is thought to be the oldest extant Mazu temple on Taiwan Island. It housed statues of the Deities brought by Koxinga from Meizhou off the Fujian coast, the site of Mazuism's chief temple. The chief idol of Mazu is soft-bodied, with jointed feet, hands, and fingers and bound feet. It holds a fan in its right hand and a handkerchief in its left. It has tablets from the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing () and from presidents Li Denghui and Chen Shuibian of the Republic of China. It was demolished by the Japanese and has been rebuilt several times, most recently in 1976. and 1994. Legends The primary idol is said to be more than a thousand years old. It is sometimes said to have been one of three personally brought to Taiwan by Koxinga, although the temple itself claims that a \\"Cheng Cheng-kung\\" brought it to Taiwan years earlier in 1661. Mazu is credited with various miracles around the temple, including appearing to lead Anping's initial settlers, protecting it from bombing during World War II, producing miraculous sweat, and protecting her idol during the temple's 1990 fire.

The site is located on the original El Camino Real de los Tejas trail. The site has no above ground remains of the mission but the mission's location is confirmed through archeological excavations. It is located half a mile south of San Augustine in the Piney Woods region of east Texas. Operated by the Texas Historical Commission, the site includes a campground, museum, gift shop and hiking trails. Description The mission was founded in 1717 by Father Antonio Margil as part of the Ramon Expedition. The Spanish sought to solidify their claims on Spanish Texas by establishing missions and presidios throughout the border area with French Louisiana. Mission Dolores was one of 6 missions founded in East Texas. Located on Ayish Bayou, the small contingent of priests and soldiers worked to convert the native Ais Indians to Roman Catholicism. In 1719, the East Texas missions were abandoned following conflicts between the French and Spanish at Los Adaes. Margil and other missionaries retreated to San Antonio de Bexar. In San Antonio, Margil established Mission San Jos√© (Texas). In 1721, the Spanish returned to East Texas and Mission Dolores was reestablished a short distance from its original location. This second location is preserved at Mission Dolores State Historic Site. The mission operated from 1721 until 1773 when the East Texas missions were once again closed. Despite operating for 52 years, the mission was not highly successful. The Ais did not live at the mission and were hesitant to accept this new religion. The missionaries baptized approximately 30 natives in 52 years. Most of the baptisms also happened at the point of death, leading many Ais to fear the baptismal waters believing the water brought death. Only a handful of Europeans lived at Mission Dolores over the 52 years of occupation. Normally one or two priests lived at the mission with two soldiers and their families. Due to the extreme distance from the Spanish government in Mexico City, the missionaries often traded illegally with the closer French traders in Natchitoches, Louisiana. The mission was abandoned in 1773. Anglo-American settlement began in the early nineteenth century and led to the establishment of San Augustine, Texas. The town grew up about half a mile from the mission location. According to contemporary newspapers, the American settlers were aware there was a mission south of town on \\"Mission Hill\\" but there were no longer any remains. The property remained in private hands and numerous homesteads were constructed on it throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Archeological Excavations Professional excavations began in the 1970s to determine the exact location of Mission Dolores. Dr. Kathleen Gilmore led the first investigation but her excavations were inconclusive. Dr. James Corbin of Stephen F. Austin State University led several field schools in the area and finally scientifically confirmed the location of Mission Dolores. Unfortunately the construction of Highway 147 destroyed approximately half of the site. However, Corbin was able to locate middens, wells, post holes and other features associated with the mission and recovered numerous 18th century artifacts. Archeological investigations have continued since then. New evidence suggests the mission compound may be larger than originally thought. Recent technology has also been able to confirm the existence of an intact segment of El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail on the property, which would have run directly through the mission compound. Preservation The site of Mission Dolores had been preserved by landowners and community members throughout the latter half of the twentieth century. In the late nineties, the City of San Augustine received a grant to construct a museum, campground and archeology laboratory on the site. In 2016, the City of San Augustine requested that the Texas Historical Commission assume ownership and operation of the site. The request was accepted and Mission Dolores became the 21st State Historic Site and first Spanish Colonial site operated by the Texas Historical Commission. Future plans for the site include renovating and updating the museum exhibits, installing interpretive signage on the trails, and potentially constructing a historically accurate mission building. Educational programs at the site provide further insight into the history of the mission and other cultural resources of East Texas.

It was proclaimed on 15 August 1876, comprising an area of 508 square kilometres, including the Hundred of Anna, the southern portion of the Hundred of Dutton and the northern portion of the Hundred of Jellicoe. There had been two previous proposals to introduce local government in the Truro area, in 1860 and 1868, but these were rejected after local opposition. The council was divided into three wards (Truro, Dutton and Anna), each electing two councillors, on 16 June 1885. In the same year, it built council chambers in Truro township at a cost of ¬£104. The council gained the Hundred of Skurray on 7 September 1933 from the abolished District Council of Swan Reach, which added the town of Blanchetown. An additional ward, Skurray Ward, was established, electing one councillor. In 1936, the council covered a total area of 190,382 acres, with a population of 892 residing in 450 houses. The council area had a ratable capital value of ¬£292,360, resulting in an annual income for the council of ¬£791/16/2. In that year, it was responsible for 30 miles of main roads and 434 miles of district roads. In 1966, the council chambers moved to a building adjoining their original chambers. The chambers moved again in 1983, when the council purchased and refurbished a separate building. In 1976, their centenary year, the council published The District Council of Truro: One Hundred Years of Local Government by Reg Munchenburg. A second history by Munchenburg, Truro, the travellers rest, wheels, wheat, wool, 1838-1989 : a history of Truro, Dutton, St. Kitts, Sandleton and Steinfeld was published by the council in 1989. In 1986, the council district had an area of 792.5 square kilometres, \\"bounded on the west by the watershed of the Mount Lofty Ranges...and on the east by the Murray River\\", with a population estimated at 600. The main towns were Truro and Blanchetown. The primary industries of the district were wheat, barley, oats and grazing, with tourism being the main secondary industry. It was acknowledged by the 1980s that the Truro council would \\"experience constant pressure for amalgamation or dismemberment\\" in the coming years. This occurred on 1 October 1991, when the council amalgamated with the District Council of Ridley to form the District Council of Ridley-Truro. Chairmen of the District Council of Truro * J. F. A.

The collection consists of tens of thousands of Sudanese and Southern Sudanese government documents running from the early 1900s, through the independence of Sudan in 1956 and Sudan's First (1955‚Äì1972) and Second (1983‚Äì2005) civil wars, to the late 1990s. The archives are run by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports in Juba, South Sudan. History The National Archives of South Sudan grew out of the work of Enoch Mading de Garang who in 1976, when he was the Regional Minister of Information, Culture, Youth and Sports, conceived of the idea for an archive of Southern Sudanese political movements. Enoch Mading expanded the archive to include Southern Sudan's administrative records on the advice of the historian Robert O. Collins.Robert Oakley Collins (1933-2008) was a prolific historian of Sudan. R.O. Collins traveled with his wife to southern Sudan in 1976, after being invited by Enoch Mading de Garang to compile a report on ways to collect and preserve materials related to Southern Sudan's recent history as part of the Southern Sudan Historical Retrieval Project. Among other things, R.O. Collins consulted officials and scholars and made an inventory of district files and filing systems. See The archives department was created in 1977 as part of the Ministry of Information and Culture. Government records suffered serious damage in Southern Sudan during Sudan's first and second civil wars. Many documents were destroyed by heat, termites, floods, humidity, fire, and neglect. Many of these records were gathered together in the Southern Records Office in Juba in the 1970s and early 1980s by Douglas H. Johnson after the First Sudanese Civil War (1955‚Äì1972).Douglas H. Johnson was then working for the Southern Records Office in Juba, a predecessor to the National Archives of South Sudan. See Johnson, Douglas (2004). \\"Talking their Language: A Rare Language Exam from the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan\\". Sudan Studies. 32. Douglas Johnson has described recent work on restoring the archive in \\"The Revival of the Southern Sudan's Archives,\\" Sudan Studies, 43, pp.28-36, 2011. During the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), these documents were scattered, neglected, and sometimes destroyed. South Sudan archive storage tent in Juba, 2010 Authority over the archives was transferred from the Central Equatoria State to the Government of South Sudan after the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. Emergency work on the restoration of the Archive began in 2005, during the period of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, with support from the US Ambassadors‚Äô Cultural Fund. This involved the erection of a tent near the administrative headquarters of Central Equatoria state in Juba, where documents from the Archive were collected \\"in a disordered state\\" from the various locations where they had been stored in Juba during the war. In 2010, the British Institute in Eastern Africa (BIEA) and the Rift Valley Institute (RVI) began a second phase of emergency conservation and digitization, which involved the provision of archive boxes and digitization equipment and training in digitisation techniques and archiving practice for South Sudanese. A third phase, funded by Michigan University and implemented by RVI, followed in 2013 and continued the work of emergency conservation and digitisation. At South Sudan's independence ceremony in Juba in 2011, Pa'gan Amum Okiech, then Secretary General of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), announced that the old Sudanese flag lowered after independence would be kept at the National Archive in memory of the neighboring country's \\"shared history.\\" The project has received support from the Government of Norway for the construction of a permanent South Sudan National Archive Building. The Norwegian Government and the Prince Claus Foundation also provided funding for the renovation of a temporary building in Munuki, Juba, to provide temporary accommodation for the Archive. The construction of the new archives building was scheduled to begin in July 2014 and finish in July 2015. The planned construction of a permanent archive was disrupted by instability in South Sudan. Collections The contents of the archive range from the early 1900s to the 1980-1990s and are often the only detailed records of previous local South Sudanese administrations in existence. The archive's holdings include monthly diaries and yearly reports, inspection reports, district and provincial reports, handing over notes, and general correspondences and reports. Tarikh Tana (Our History) In November, 2017, documents preserved in the National Archives of South Sudan were featured on Tarikh Tana (Our History), a five-part radio series broadcast by Eye Radio (98.6 FM) in Juba. The program was supported by the South Sudan Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, the Rift Valley Institute, and UNESCO, with funding from Norway. The first episode was hosted by Rosemary Ochinyi and focused on documents related to the sentencing of the Torit Mutineers, the second an extract of the Gospel of St Mark from a 1952 Bible; and the third episode focused on an Instructional Pamphlet on Malaria in Bor Dinka, from 1948. The fourth episode focused on the archive document An Appeal by the Peace Delegation to the Anyanya from 1967. The final episode focused on a document titled The functions of the leopard-skin chief, a selection from a draft manual of Nuer customary law commissioned by the colonial authorities in 1944.

Early life and career Parona was born in Novara, Piedmont, on April 23, 1889, son of Emilio Parona and Elena Tarella. He entered the Naval Academy in Livorno in 1906 and graduated in 1910 with the rank of Ensign.Dizionario Biografico Uomini della Marina Militare. He participated in the Italo-Turkish war on board the armored cruiser Varese; when Italy entered World War I, Parona, by then a lieutenant, was assigned to the ironclad battleship . During World War I, Parona initially took part in ground fighting on the Isonzo front with the Naval Brigade; he was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valor for an action near Monfalcone in May 1916. Later in the war, he was given command of the submarine F 17, distinguishing himself and receiving a Bronze Medal of Military Valor for an action against a convoy in the Adriatic Sea in July 1918. He remained in the submarine branch even after World War I; he was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in 1922 and to Commander in 1927. After attending the Naval Warfare Institute, he was assigned for three years to the office of the Chief of Staff of the Navy. In 1932 Parona, together with Captain Vladimiro Pini, translated in Italian Hermann Bauer‚Äôs Das Unterseeboot: Seine and Bedeutg als Teil. fleets; Seine Stellg im V√∂lkerrecht; Seine Kriegsverwendg; Seine Zukunft, a treatise on the design and the tactical use of the U-Boot. Promoted to captain in 1937, for the next two years Parona held the office of naval attach√© at the Embassy of Italy in Paris. Between August 1936 and August 1937 Parona was the commanding officer of the heavy cruiser Trieste, and then he became Chief of Staff of the 3rd Naval Division. In 1938, after promotion to rear admiral, he became deputy inspector of the construction and testing of the new ships built for the Navy, and then Head of Cabinet of the Ministry of the Navy in Rome. World War II and aftermath Parona and his German counterpart Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, 1941 When Italy entered World War II, on June 10, 1940, Parona held the post deputy commander of Italy's submarine fleet. During a military conference in Friedrichshafen on June 20, 1939, the Regia Marina and the Kriegsmarine had agreed that Italy would participate in the submarine warfare in the Atlantic, and that an Italian Atlantic submarine base would be created in German-held territory.Giorgio Giorgerini, ‚ÄúUomini sul fondo. Storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini ad oggi‚Äù, pages 439 to 503. On 25 July 1940, after the fall of France, the Ministry of the Navy sanctioned the establishment of the Italian Atlantic Command and appointed Parona commander of the 21st Submarine Group, that would operate in the Atlantic. In August 1940 Parona, together with German Admiral Eberhard Weichold (the Kriegsmarine liaison officer in Italy), visited a number of ports on the Atlantic coast and chose Bordeaux as the basis for the Italian submarines. Supermarina, the high command of the Italian Navy, validated the choice and decided that from September 1, 1940 the command of the Atlantic Submarine Group would be created; its official denomination would be High command of the Italian Submarine Forces in the Atlantic, better known BETASOM. Parona arrived in Bordeaux at the end of August 1940 and quickly organized the new base. Admiral Karl D√∂nitz and the Seekriegsleitung judged Parona favourably, for his cleverness, determination and readiness to cooperate with the German commands, while some Italian admirals considered him excessively \\"pro-German\\" and thought that he overestimated the capacity of the Italian submarines and their inexperienced crews, completely unprepared for the Atlantic conditions, to operate in the Northern Atlantic. Italian submarines started to operate in the Atlantic in the summer of 1940, but achieved little success; Parona, disappointed by the initial results of his submarines, reprimanded harshly several of his submarine commanders, whom he expected should be able to obtain a performance comparable to that of the U-Boats, disregarding their lack of experience, inadequate rules, and technical defects of the boats. Parona's excessive sternness caused frictions both between him and some of his commanders, and between him and Supermarina, the latter recommending that he should tone down his criticism and be less influenced by the Germans. At the end of 1940, Parona ordered several measures that aimed to improve the performance of his submarines: taking cue from the Kriegsmarine, older Italian submarine commanders (some were 40 years old) were replaced with younger officers, who possessed more aggressiveness and stamina; a \\"submarine school\\" was created in Gotenhafen, where commanders, officers and bridge crews of the Betasom submarines were trained according to the German model (the submarine Reginaldo Giuliani was assigned to this task, in cooperation with German naval units). Italian submarines also underwent improvement work, such as the reshaping of their excessively large turrets. These measures significantly improved the performance of the Italian submarines; from mid-1941, Italian submarine started to achieve more success (the average tonnage sunk by Betasom submarines would rise from 3,844 GRT in 1940 to 27,335 GRT in 1942). Parona, however, was still unsatisfied, and this led to new frictions between him and Supermarina for his severe treatment of some commanders. In April 1941, meanwhile, he had been promoted to vice admiral. In Autumn 1941, about half of the Betasom submarines were sent back to Italy, as they were highly needed for operations in the Mediterranean, and this made Parona's rank excessive for the size of his command; in September 1941, therefore, he was replaced by Captain Romolo Polacchini as the commander of Betasom. Back in Italy, in November 1941 Parona was given command of the 3rd Cruiser Division, after its commander, Bruno Brivonesi, had been removed from command after the Battle of the Duisburg Convoy. His flagship was the heavy cruiser Gorizia. As the commander of the 3rd Cruiser Division, between December 1941 and August 1942 Parona participated in the First and Second Battle of Sirte, where his division inconclusively clashed with the escorting forces of British convoys to Malta, Operation Vigorous (known in Italy as the Battle of Mid June) and Operation Pedestal (known in Italy as the Battle of Mid August), where his force did not make contact with enemy ships. In December 1942 the 3rd Cruiser Division (by then down to the heavy cruisers Trieste and Gorizia), in the face of increasing Allied bombings against Italian naval base in Southern Italy, was transferred to La Maddalena, Sardinia. On April 10, 1943, 84 USAAF bombers attacked La Maddalena and the 3rd Division; Trieste was sunk and Gorizia was disabled, thus effectively annihilating Parona's command. He was then transferred to the Navy Ministry in Rome, where he became the director of military personnel and services. He was in Rome when the armistice of Cassibile was announced. According to one source, after the war the High Commissioner for the Epuration of the Public Administration accused him of not opposing the Germans while in Rome in the days of the armistice; of having left all the documentation of his office to Captain Carmine D'Arienzo, whom was known to have adhered to the Italian Social Republic; and of having written a list of all the officers of the Italian Navy in Rome on September 8, which then ended up in German hands.Romano Giacosa, Storia delle epurazioni in Italia ‚Äì Le sanzioni contro il fascismo 1943-1948, Baldini & Castoldi, Milan, 1999. According to the official history of the Italian Navy, published in 1971, Parona instead had the list destroyed and, during the German occupation of Rome, co-operated with the Clandestine Military Front, a Resistance organization that included several high-ranking officers of the Italian armed forces.Giuseppe Fioravanzo, La Marina dall‚Äô8 settembre 1943 alla fine del conflitto, USMM, Roma, 1971, pp. 442-443. After the liberation of Rome, Parona resumed active service and was appointed Commander of the Naval Department of the Ionian Sea (with headquarters in Taranto), a role that he held from 1944 to 1946. In 1945 he was promoted to admiral. From 1948 to 1951 he was responsible for the permanent lighting of coasts and headlights. He was placed in the reserve in 1951. Parona died in Rome on 14 May 1977.

Stanley was an American painter, educator, art activist, and publisher, whose primary study, teaching and body of work was figurative art and portrait painting. He was a pioneer in the Mail Art movement, and is noted for opening the first independent art gallery in the East Village, Manhattan. In 1987, Pittore founded \\"The Academy of Carlo Pittore\\" in Bowdoinham, Maine. He died of cancer in 2005. Early life Pittore (n√©e Charles Stanley) was born to Stanford and Estelle Stanley in Queens, New York. He grew up on Long Island, in Port Washington, New York with his sister Marion and brother Elliott. Early education Pittore graduated from Port Washington High School (1961), where he was active in the political and debating scenes. He then went on to graduate from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts (1966), and post graduate from the Brooklyn Museum Art School (1978). Pittore changed his name in the 1970s while studying abroad in Rome, Italy. The children nicknamed him \\"Carlo Pittore\\", (‚ÄùCharles the Painter\\"). From there he went on to study at the Chelsea College of Arts in London. In 1978, Pittore received the Max Beckmann Scholarship in Advanced Painting. It allowed him to begin studying with American feminist painter Joan Semmel at the Brooklyn Museum Art School. He also studied with visual portrait artist Alice Neel. After which, he taught art at the New York Cultural Foundation. Career In the 1970s, Pittore and his close friend Bern Porter published mail art under the stamp series ‚ÄúPost Me‚Äù, which he published through \\"Pittore Euforico, New York\\". Pittore also published such works as \\"Maine Moments in New York\\" (1979), \\"Colleagues\\" (1979), The Adventures of Carlo Pittore\\" (1979) and \\"Salva la Campagna Romana\\" (1982). Pittore illustrated the book ‚Äò‚ÄôBern! Porter! Interview!‚Äô‚Äô with original rubber and mail stamps. Pittore opened ‚ÄúThe Galleria dell ' Occhio‚Äù in 1980. It was the first independent art gallery in the East Village, New York City. Well known as a street level window art space open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, it was during this time that Pittore met and became acquainted with artists such as Chuck Welch (a.k.a. the Cracker Jack Kid), Ray Johnson, and Keith Haring. Pittore painted Haring from life, a fact which Haring, a student at the School of Visual Arts at the time, mentions in his journals. Pittore‚Äôs works have been shown in such places as Italy, Belgium, Tokyo, Chicago, New York (Museum Modern Art, Getty Institute for Art History & The Humanites, New York City Public Library), Los Angeles, Spain, Norway; and now hang in private collections throughout the world. Due to the devastation caused by the outbreak of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s, Pittore left the lower East Side of Manhattan and moved to Maine permanently. In 1987 he founded \\"The Academy of Carlo Pittore\\" in Bowdoinham, Maine. Here he invited artists from all over to come and share their knowledge and talents in an academic forum; whilst he himself hosted drawing classes, painted and drew the artists (and models) and also cooked for them. Pittore founded the ‚ÄúUnion of Maine Visual Artists‚Äù in 1975. The UMVA passed into state law the ‚ÄúMaine Percent for Art Program‚Äù and the ‚ÄúArtist‚Äôs Estate Tax Law‚Äù. From 1978 to 1980, he was a council member for the \\"Comprehensive Employment Training Act Artists Project\\" in New York City. Just before his death in 2005, the Maine College of Art awarded Pittore an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts. The \\"Carlo Pittore Foundation for the Figurative Arts\\" was founded in 2006. Style Pittore painted in the figurative and portraiture style; focusing mainly on the nude form of study. On account of this, critics and objectors occasionally viewed his work as \\"erotic\\" rather than objective art. Throughout his life, Pittore was extremely vocal toward such critics and what he perceived to be \\"ignorance\\" toward his art or art in general. He did not shy away from either voicing his opinion in letters to the editor or removing his exhibits from art galleries or public showings. The colors red and green (symbols of the Italian flag) were two essential components in Pittore's work that defined his belief and understanding in complementary palette application. The contrast of these two color schemes arise time and again throughout his works; as can be seen in \\"Portrait of Blair Tily\\" (1987), \\"Opera - Self Portrait\\" (1981), \\"La Buffonera\\" (1983), and \\"Portrait of a Skeptic\\" (1996). Pittore's \\"Lincoln Portrait Series\\" was the only oil-on-canvas medium in which he worked without color. For this he painted entirely in black and white due to the fact that the portraits were modeled after 19th century photographs of Abraham Lincoln.

The site includes the former town of Rudefeha and is near Encampment, Wyoming. The smelter was constructed in 1902 by Grand Encampment promoter Willis George Emerson, connected to the main Ferris-Haggerty Mine location by a aerial tram over the Continental Divide. The smelter initially produced matte, an intermediate product in copper refining. In 1903 it was upgraded to produce blister copper. Power for the blowers needed for the blister refining process came from a water turbine at the end of a diameter wood-stave pipe from the South Fork of the Encampment River, away. The smelter could process 300 to 400 tons of ore a day. with A decline in the price of copper, poor yield from the mines, bad weather and financial difficulties plagued the mining venture, particularly after it had been sold to outside investors for $10,000,000 in 1904. A fire in March 1906 destroyed most of the smelter, and another in May set back reconstruction efforts. The smelter was rebuilt, but was under-insured. By 1910 the Penn- Wyoming Copper Company was bankrupt and the smelter was shut down and salvaged in 1913. All smelter buildings have been removed and the site is used as a trash dump. The foundations remain. The smelter site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1973.

It protects a rugged, forested area that is home to several rare or endangered species of mammals. Location The Nova Baden State Park is in the municipality of Lambari in the southern part of the state of Minas Gerais. It has an area of . It is in the Serra da Mantiqueira, in the Ribeir√£o do Melo sub-basin of the Rio Grande basin. The terrain is steep and mountainous, with altitudes from . The climate has well-defined seasons, with average temperatures from and occasional frost. Temperatures and rainfall are lower in winter, which lasts from April to September. Rain falls in more than 180 days each year. There are several springs in the forest. The main stream creates the Sete Quedas waterfall. History The area was protected in 1974 when the Nova Baden Biological Reserve was created. This was changed to the Nova Baden State Park by decree 36.069 of 27 September 1994. Environment The park holds Atlantic Forest flora and fauna. Tree species include jequitib√°, cedro, peroba, palmito, jacarand√°, pinheiro brasileiro and cedro. The highest trees are from high. The climate is moist, creating an ecosystem rich in mosses, lichens, bromeliads and orchids. There are diverse lichens growing on the trees. These are sensitive to air pollution and drastic changes to the environment, so their presence indicates that air quality is good. There is a marshy area in the park with an exotic ornamental called marsh lily, and many species of herbaceous shrubs and trees of different families. The park is an important refuge for several species of amphibians, mammals and birds. There are 22 species of mammals. Primates include howler monkeys, titis, micos and robust capuchin monkeys. There are ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), coatis, armadillos and southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla). There are also Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans), tapeti (Sylvilagus brasiliensis), oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Puma concolor) and buffy-tufted marmoset (Callithrix aurita). 78 species of birds have been identified from 30 families and 14 orders. Birds include drab- breasted bamboo tyrant (Hemitriccus diops), variable antshrike (Thamnophilus caerulescens), olivaceous woodcreeper (Sittasomus griseicapillus), blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana), blue manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata), robust woodpecker (Campephilus robustus), red-ruffed fruitcrow (Pyroderus scutatus), shrike-like laniisoma (Laniisoma elegans), saffron finch (Sicalis flaveola), wedge-tailed grass finch (Emberizoides herbicola) and yellow-faced siskin (Spinus yarrellii). The insect pachymeroceroides novabadensis, which prefers a very humid environment, was first discovered in the park. Facilities The park has a visitor center in a 19th-century mansion that was once home of the engineer, writer and politician Am√©rico Werneck, whose family came from Baden- Baden, Germany, and whose land became the park. It includes an auditorium for 90 people, meeting rooms and an environmental police post. The headquarters has gardens, lawns and a small playground for children. There are three trails, each taking less than an hour. One leads to the Sete Quedas waterfall and passes a jequitib√° tree more than 300 years old. The others lead through interesting forest areas and over watercourses. There is no camping area or visitor accommodations. As of 2016 the park was open from 08:00 to 17:00 on Tuesdays to Sundays and holidays.

Biography He was born in Cetona in the province of Siena, Tuscany, to a mason of modest means. But his skills gained him admission first to the Institute of Fine Arts of Rome, then of Naples. In Naples, Balestrieri was forced to support himself as a decorative painter for rooms in private residences, but continued studying under Gioacchino Toma. Then briefly re- enrolled in the Institute of Fine Arts of Naples, then under the leadership Filippo Palizzi and Domenico Morelli. However, lured by the bohemian artistic circles of Paris, at the age of 20 years he moved there, working as an assistant to the Florentine engraver Osvaldo Tofani. Balestrieri contributed engravings for an edition of Dante's Divina Commedia published by Vittorio Alinari in 1900.Dante's Divina Commedia, Vittorio Alinari publisher, 1903. He became friend and apartment-mate, with a violinist, Giuseppe Vannicola, whom he depicting in a canvas Waiting for the glory, exhibited at the 1897 Paris Salon. Beethoven, 1900 Music continued to inspire his art for decades. In 1898, he painted the Death of Mim√¨ (illustrated below) (Museum of the City, New York), for which Balestrieri painted himself as Rodolfo. In 1899, he painted a canvas depicting Beethoven (Kreutzer Sonata),https://books.google.com/books?id=L1E0BOMAGJ0C L'Illustrazione italiana, Part 2; page 28. This painting, which was awarded a prize at the 1900 Universal Exposition in Paris and in 1901 in Venice, brought him fame. The painting depicts a dimly lit garret-like apartment with a strand of listeners along the left wall, each in their own mood, while a violinist plays between them and a furnace. The face of the musician is hidden, and the wall has the empty gaze of a plaster mask of Beethoven.The Changing Image of Beethoven: A Study in Mythmaking, by Alessandra Comini, page 398. Numerous reproductions were made and sold of the painting. By the 20th century he had come to know prominent composers such as Puccini, Giordano and Cilea. In 1902, when his mentor Morelli was dying, he travelled to Naples; from this encounter came another prominent work: The last days of Domenico Morelli, first exhibited in Monaco (1902), then in Venice (1903),L'arte a Venezia, review of Death of Morelli painting (1903). and now on display at the Galleria Civica of Udine. Balestrieri continued to paint Romantic subjects, tinged with emotion, specially referring to music. His style often changed with exposure to other currents such as Impressionism, the Macchiaioli style, but also styles compelled by a social realism. However, in 1914, he left Paris and settled in Naples, where he was recruited to direct the Institute of Fine Arts. In Naples, he often favored landscapes, but also painted many genre scenes and portraits. He was briefly linked to a group of artists calling themselves the Gruppo degli Ostinati (Group of Obstinates); including Alberto Chiancone, Franco Girosi (1896-1987), Giovanni Brancaccio, Eugenio Viti, Manfredi Franco and Francesco Galante; meeting at the Caff√® Tripoli at Piazza del Plebiscito; and urging the introduction of Modernist styles into the Neapolitan art circles.Galleria Cinquentisei , Bologna, short biography. By the 1920s under the influence of Futurism, he painted works such as \\"Musical Sensations (1923), and also painted works celebrating Fascist power and Mussolini, such as Victorious March. In the 1950s, he experimented with modernist, cubist canvases. Late in life, he decided to return to Cetona, still painting landscapes when he died.Fondazione Balestrieri, biography of artist. In his hometown of Cetona, a foundation named after the painter was established with the aim of fostering cultural events. It has organized, with the help of the comune, a number of restrospectives of the painter and his circle, including one in 2015 at the Palazzo Minutelli Ciolo (city hall).Toscana900, announcement of Balestrieri exhibition.

It was made in Nottingham in 1813. The name of the machine was the Leavers machine (the 'a' was added to aid pronunciation in France). The original machine made net but it was discovered that the Jacquard apparatus could be adapted to it. From 1841 lace complete with pattern, net and outline could be made on the Leavers machine. History Most lace machines stem from the weft-knitting Stocking frame. The Leavers machine is a derivative of Heathcoat's 1809 Old Loughborough. The Leavers machine was invented by John Levers,(sic) a framesmith and setter-up of Sutton-in-Ashfield. Sources give the date as either 1813 or 1814, and the location as Derby Road, Nottingham. Patent applications up until 1930, spelled the name without an 'a', but about 1906, foreign sources had started to insert an 'a'. The Lace working party of 1946 standardised the name with an 'a' and the trade association henceforth adopted that spelling. Until 1823 they were used solely to make plain net, working on a 60 inch beam at 80 motions per minute In 1828 an improvement was made to drive the bobbin carriage at intervals, thus leaving time for 'shogging' the guide bars between each movement. In 1841 use of a knob Jacquard allowed the insertion of thick thread (liner). The knobs allowed a greater distance and allowed the automatic gimping around flowered patterns. The number of Leavers in use was dependent on the market and during periods of depression or cotton shortage many frames were broken up for their iron content. The use of Raschel machines, noted for being better for artificial fibres increased in the 1970s and, with fine polyesters, the two products have converged. =United States context= Before 1909 there were only 100 Leavers machines in the United States. Importing them was prohibitively expensive due to a 45% import tariff. The US lost many soldiers to malaria in a skirmish in Spanish America, and need for mosquito netting was seen. The US Tariff Act of 1909 provided free entry for Leavers machines, during a 19 month window from 6 August 1909 to 31 December 1910. Thus by 1947 there were 730 machines in 54 mills employing 5000 people. The 'twist-hands' were mainly emigrants from the lace making areas of France and England, as operating the machine is a complex process to learn. The Amalgamated Lace Operators of America, Leavers Section considered a three year apprenticeship to be the minimum and longer to be fully effective. Description =The lace machine= The brass bobbin in the carriage which move in a cradle between the warp threads The Leavers machine is probably the most versatile of all machines for making patterned lace. A machine will weigh 17 tons and have 40,000 moving parts and carry between 12,000 and 50,000 threads. Working widths are always multiples of since the web is calculated in quarter yards. It has two warp beams, though it can be run using just one or none. An S-twist thread is out on the front warp (right warp) and a Z- twist on the back warp (left warp, reverse warp). All the warp ends pass through a sley with individual perforations- to keep the threads from tangling. On a machine with 3000 front warp ends, that will mean 6000 perforations, all front warp ends will be of the same count, and all back warp ends will be of the same count, though the two warps can carry different counts. The warp threads interact with the brass bobbin threads to form the net or openwork ground. The reverse warp threads (introduced in 1830) lock the front warp threads against the bobbin threads. The warp threads are tensioned by a spring. The heavy connector to the Jacquard unit, with the individual guide bars (Photo. Nottingham Industrial Museum) Beams are the vertical threads from a beam roller that contributes to the pattern. Lace is made up of motif that is repeated vertically and horizontally. If a design has 48 horizontal repeats, there will be 48 threads on each beam roller. Every beam roller has its own guidebar, made of thin watch-spring steel. Each front warp ends has its own guidebar. The back warp ends share 4 stump bars between them. The guide bars are controlled by the Jacquards so can be reposition for each motion, indeed they are also known as Jacquard bars; they are held in a bar box above the sley but below the carriages. =The process= There are up to 32 processes involved in designing and producing a run of Leavers lace, To start with, there are 5 five processes in transferring the initial art work to the machine. There are nine processes needed to prepare the 4 types of yarn. The single process of running the machine and up to 14 finishing processes, thus there is a lot of ancillary equipment. The Jacquard in place The art work is designed six times life size and reduced using a pantograph. The design is converted to the Jacquard code and punched onto the Jacquard cards. The cards are stitched and mounted on the Jacquard. The thread arrives either on cones or in skeins. It has to be slip wound onto spools. There are four types of yarn used in Leavers machine * The heavy warp thread that needs to be warped from a creel of spools or cones onto a warp beam. There will be one thread for each end. There are two set of warp thread, right twist and left twist,- one used for stability and the other used for twisting. Bobbin winding unit- taking 140 bobbins * The brass bobbin yarns are wound on special brass bobbin winding units, with the spools held on jack stands. and then these brass bobbins are compressed by 25% at a pressure of 20 tons per square inch. They are then steamed and cooled. These have to be manually placed in the carrier and held by a spring. The thread needs to be laced to the previous one On depletion of the first bobbin, the whole set is removed and goes through a stripper. * The skein yarns which gimp the warps are spooled on to a beam and then beamed onto the machine. * The liner threads are spooled onto a beam The finishing processes are clipping, scalloping, drawing, cutting, hand cutting, cloth looking and mending and the familiar textile processes such as bleaching, dyeing, stretching to width, drying, folding and packing.

Historical references can be traced back to 1428 when Copster Hill formed part of the lands of John de Assheton and the Roman road from Manchester to York passed through the area.

The Bent family occupied Gate Field House, owned by John Bent prior to his death in 1778, while the Kershaw family lived at Copster Hill. John Kershaw, the owner of the house in 1778, rebuilt Cospter Hill renaming it Copster House. Sometime before 1791 John Kershaw built a cotton mill. on land between what is now Copster Place and Copster House. (Copster House was recently demolished to make way for Cop Thorn estate.) The mill was small compared to later mills and probably used horses to power the machinery. However, by 1829 steam power had been introduced.

It is situated to the west of Peterlee, near Thornley and Wingate. It is currently closed following a serious fire but usually races on Friday evenings at 7.15pm, Facilities included a club, bar, and tote which were destroyed in the fire. Origins The track was constructed for the mining community and is known to have been active in 1947. It is known to have hosted whippet racing as early as 1936 and likely to have raced some greyhound racing as well. The stadium is situated on the north side Black Lane that runs off the Avenue. History Norman Fannon bought the track in 1965 and spent a large sum of money improving the facilities. A custom made hare called the McFannon (made from hundreds of ex-Army bedsteads) was Fannon's favourite. The track was very tight, almost circular at the time. During the 1970s, racing was held on Wednesday and Saturday evenings at 7.30pm over race distances of 270, 450, and 600 yards. There was an 'Inside Sumner' hare system and the track was all-grass. Facilities included a licensed club. Fannon remained the owner and, by the late 1980s, the track had become sand and had a McGee hare system.

Developed along South Union Street between Main and Howard Streets, South Union grew between about 1835 and 1938 as a popular area for well-to-do yet middle class Burlingtonians, affording views of Lake Champlain to the west. The architecturally diverse district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Burlington's South Union Street was first laid out early in the city's history, as one of its primary routes to the south. It was at first agrarian, with widely spaced brick houses, a number of which survive. The city's economy developed after the railroad arrived in the 1840s, and the road, set roughly midway between the lowlands along Lake Champlain, and the hill to the east where the University of Vermont campus is located, developed as an area where the newly well-to-do could build good quality homes with views of the lake. Houses are typically oriented toward the west, and set as far east (up the hill) as possible. Those on the east side of South Union, especially those built in the Second Empire and Queen Anne styles, also feature towers to improve the view. with The historic district is essentially linear, extending along South Union between Main and Howard Street. It extends to the sides to include properties on four side streets: Kingsland Terrace, Cliff Street, Bayview Street, and Spruce Street. The district covers , and has 178 historically significant buildings, all residential. They are in a diversity of styles, but are typically two to two-and-one-half stories in height, and share similarities in size and setting.
