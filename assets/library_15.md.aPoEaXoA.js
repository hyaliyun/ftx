The son of a doctor from Enniskillen, Beatty was first employed in 1842 at the age of 22 by Peto and Betts on building the Norwich and Lowestoft line. In 1853 he was in Nova Scotia surveying the European and North American Railway and despite adverse weather conditions, the line was staked out in good time.Cooke, p.25. Towards the end of 1854 he was appointed by Peto, Brassey and Betts as Chief Engineer of the Grand Crimean Central Railway, built to convey supplies to the Allied forces in the Crimean War.Cooke, p.26. He arrived in Balaklava in January 1855 to join Donald Campbell and his team who had already started to survey the line.Cooke, pp.32-33. Beatty's energy and enthusiasm ensured that the line, which included a stretch at a gradient of 1 in 14, was laid in a very short time.Cooke, pp.46-47, 64. In April, Beatty was involved in an accident on the line when a train went out of control. He sustained an injury which appeared originally not to be serious but he never fully recovered from it.Cooke, pp.75-76. With the railway substantially complete in November he was still far from well and he left for England.Cooke, pp.118-119.

Crooks was well known in his era as an extremely patient hitter, often fouling off many pitches until he got one that he could hit.Management By Baseball This approach led him to draw many walks (also, \\"bases on balls\\", or BB), in fact, he held the record for walks by rookie second basemen as well, when he walked 96 times for the Columbus Solons of the American Association in 1890. He held this record until Jim Gilliam of the Brooklyn Dodgers walked 100 times in 1953. Despite hitting just .213 in 1892, he walked a league-leading 136 times put his on-base percentage (OBP) at .400, good for fifth in National League. He also became the Major League single-season record holder in that category, a title he held until Jimmy Sheckard walked 147 times in 1911. That total remained the St Louis Browns/Cardinals single-season franchise record until 1998, when Mark McGwire walked 162 times. The next season, while batting just .237, Crooks' league-leading 121 BB put his OBP at .408. In addition to playing for Columbus, Crooks also had stints with the Washington Senators, Louisville Colonels, and the St. Louis Browns on two occasions. During his first tenure, he was named as their player-manager, in 1892 on an interim basis twice that season.

It is part of the Chicago Park District (CPD). Located on the south bank of the Chicago River, the park is divided into three sections by a Santa Fe rail track and 18th Street. It was designed by Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group and features a pagoda-style pavilion, bamboo gardens, and a playground. The park is named in honor of prominent Chinatown businessman and civic leader Ping Tom; a bronze bust of Tom is installed near the park's pavilion. Phase I was completed in 1999, and Phase II was completed in 2011. The fieldhouse was completed in 2013. Overview In 1962, the construction preparations for the Dan Ryan Expressway demolished the only two parks in the Chinatown area (Hardin Square and Stanford Park). Sun Yat-sen Playlot Park, a small, park, was created in the mid-1970s; however, the community wanted a larger open park space. The Chinese American Development Corporation, a private real estate firm formed by Ping Tom then purchased a former rail yard in 1989. After construction of Chinatown Square began on this property, the CPD purchased approximately of unused land along the Chicago River in 1991, along with an additional that extended along the river north of 18th Street. The southern-half of the area then underwent significant renovation, as the retaining wall along the river was repaired and an at-grade rail crossing was installed at the park's western boundary. Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5 million. The park was officially opened on October 2, 1999. In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired an additional immediately east of the park's then-undeveloped northern half. The second stage of development, covering north of 18th Street was completed in 2011, and included the area's shoreline and access points. In September 2009, a $10 million budget was approved to start development on the area along the Chicago River. The boathouse was opened on June 9, 2013, while the field house was opened later that year on October 14, 2013. The park is served by a water taxi operated by Wendella Boats (Chicago Water Taxi). It is the southernmost stop, with other stops at Madison Avenue (Ogilvie Station), the Chicago Riverwalk, Michigan Avenue, Goose Island, and River North. History Civic leader Ping Tom (April 15, 1935 ‚Äì July 7, 1995) played an important part in the park's creation, and it was named is his honor. In 1962, construction preparations for the Dan Ryan Expressway necessitated the demolition of Hardin Square and Stanford Parks, the only two public parks that serviced the Chinatown community. In the mid-1970s, a small, park was developed on a strip of land between 26th Street and the Stevenson Expressway; the Chicago Park District purchased the park in 1977 and named it Sun Yat-sen Playlot Park.Zhang et al., 1998, pp. 341-342. However, in a 1992 study, 75 percent of Chinatown's community leaders and 49 percent of business leaders felt that \\"the lack of open space in the Chinatown area is one of the most serious problems faclng the community\\", and both groups ranked it first among 15 community issues, including crime, education, housing, and employment. Community efforts to construct a larger park were impeded both a lack of funds and the absence of any suitable site. After fighting for decades for the construction of a new park in Chinatown, civic leader Ping Tom formed the Chinese American Development Corporation (CADC), a private real estate firm, in 1984. Five years later, the firm purchased a former Santa Fe rail yard and began construction on Chinatown Square, a $100 million residential and commercial development project. However, the area along the Chicago River was left untouched. The Chinatown community then formed the Chinatown Riverside Park Advisory Council to work with the Chicago Park District to assess the possibility of developing the remaining area into a public park. With the support of Park District Commissioner Raymond Lee, the Park District approved the proposal to purchase the land, along with an additional that extended along the river northward to 16th Street in 1991. Tom died of pancreatic cancer in July 1995‚Äîthree years before construction of the park began. During a Chinatown Chamber of Commerce meeting held in March 1998, the Riverside Park Advisory Council suggested renaming the park in honor of Ping Tom, the driving force behind its creation. The request was approved on August 3, 1998, and the park was renamed Ping Tom Memorial Park. The park was dedicated and officially opened by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley during a ceremony on October 2, 1999. In 2005, the CADC and friends of the Tom family commissioned sculptor Liao Huilana to create a bronze bust of Ping Tom. The bust was dedicated and installed at the park on October 22, 2005. Design and construction A pagoda-style pavilion is located near the park's eastern boundary--the Chicago River Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group designed the park. Having designed landscape along Chinatown's Cermak Avenue, Wong was familiar with the community and invited the public to voice their opinions and ideas for the future park. The park's original design called for walled plazas inspired by traditional Chinese gardens in Suzhou, China. This design was scrapped, however, because of security and vandalism concerns. Instead, a system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards. In Phase One of the park, a pagoda-style pavilion based on a structure that Wong had seen in Suzhou is located near the park's western boundary--the Chicago River. Site Design Group designed the pavilion's ornamentation and railings and obtained its traditional Chinese roof tiles from a source in Japan. The park's entrance is marked by the \\"Four Dragon Gateway,\\" four -tall columns, each etched with Chinese dragons and is modeled after a traditional Chinese courtyard. The park contains Chinese-influenced gardens that include ginkgo trees and bamboo. Granite boulders are scattered throughout. A children's playground is located at the north end of the park. Businesses in Chinatown attempted to raise $200,000 to build an 11-story bell tower pagoda at the south end of the park. The tower was planned to be constructed of brick and stone with a hollow interior. While visitors would not have been able to climb the structure, they would have been able to walk through an entrance at its base. Chicago Sun-Times writer Lee Bey believed the bell tower to be the park's most important feature. Despite the Taiwanese government making an early commitment to help finance the tower, it was never constructed. Before construction of then-named Chinatown Riverside Park could begin on the strip of land south of 18th Street, the area required significant renovation. The entire western boundary of the park is a functioning BNSF rail track. After determining that underground or elevated access was not feasible, an at-grade rail crossing was constructed. The US Army Corps of Engineers then restored the badly deteriorated shoreline of the Chicago River, the park's eastern boundary. At a cost of $2 million, the project improved approximately of the retaining wall and lowered the shoreline considerably from its previous position above the river. The land was also tested for any harmful contaminants from prolonged use as a rail yard. Once renovations were complete, construction began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5 million. =Expansion= The park's undeveloped northern shoreline In 2002, the Chicago Park District acquired an additional immediately east of the park's undeveloped northern half. With the acquisition of this land, the CPD planned a second development-stage--dubbed \\"Phase II\\"--of the park's nearly undeveloped. The plan called for the development of the area's shoreline and access points, as well as the construction of a cultural arts and recreational facility and a boathouse. The estimated cost was $38 million. In September 2009, the Chicago Park District‚Äôs Board of Commissioners entered into an agreement with the City of Chicago that approved the transfer of $10 million in tax increment financing (TIF) funds for the development of the park's area between the Chicago River and the BNSF rail track north of 18th Street (Phase Two). These funds were used to build a retaining wall, fish habitats and sections of natural shoreline along the area's of shoreline along the Chicago River. Open lawn and landscaped areas were developed along with a fishing station and various pathways. In 2008, the Chicago Department of Transportation hired Knight E/A to redevelop the 18th street bridge underpass and create two plazas to extend the park north. Approved also was an ordinance that finances the construction of an athletic field house in Ping Tom Memorial Park. Funds for the $10 million proposal were be allocated from the River South TIF district. On September 19, 2011, Mayor Rahm Emanuel held a press conference in the newly opened expansion of the park to announce a plan to build a series of boat houses along the Chicago River. At about this time, the phase two five-acre riverfront expansion located to the north of the existing park expanded the park to the north of the 18th street bridge. It was also designed by Site Design Group, and features a 300 linear foot boardwalk with iconic red Chinese ornamental railings that extends over the water, as well as unique decorative limestone rocks called scholar's stones or Gongshi from Lake Tai in China. These stones came from a park in Orlando, Florida called \\"Florida Splendid China,\\" owned by the Chinese government, that had gone bankrupt. Native plantings and oak savanna restoration provide a sustainable planting palette, welcoming native wildlife to the park. The project cost was $4.9 million. On June 9, 2013, Mayor Emanuel officially opened the boathouse. =Fieldhouse= On October 14, 2013, Mayor Emanuel officially opened the Ping Tom Memorial Park Fieldhouse, a 30,000 square-foot facility with a gymnasium, natatorium, fitness center, and meeting rooms. During the ceremony it was also announced that a Yellow Crane statue would be placed in the lobby of the fieldhouse. A 2012 gift from Mayor Tang of Wuhan, China to the City of Chicago, the statue symbolizes the historic Yellow Crane Tower in Wuhan, considered to be among the Four Great Towers of China. At the entrance to the fieldhouse stands a stainless steel sculpture called \\"Stone Talk,\\" donated by the city of Shanghai on June 3, 2015 to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Sister City relationship between Chicago and Shanghai. On October 10, 2015, the fieldhouse was renamed the Leonard M. Louie Fieldhouse. Louie founded the Ping Tom Park Advisory Council in 1999, and was a two-term president of the Chinese American Civic Council of Chicago and a 23-year board member of the Chinese American Service League. =Murals= On July 28, 2018, the \\"All As One\\" mural was dedicated. Located in the east plaza of the 18th Street bridge underpass, it is modeled after the blue and white designs of Ming dynasty porcelain. The artists are Andy Bellamo, Chester Chow, and Anna Murphy. On September 7, 2019, during a celebration of the 20th anniversary of the park, the \\"Between the Mountains and the Water\\" mural was dedicated in the west plaza of the 18th Street bridge underpass. This mural is patterned after Han dynasty silk landscape paintings. The artist is Anna Murphy. Also on that date, \\"Welcome to Ping Tom Memorial Park\\" and \\"Be Like Water\\" (‰∏ä ÂñÑ Ëã•Ê∞¥) murals were dedicated on the westernmost support. The park with seasonal planting Timeline for the development of Ping Tom Memorial Park (1999-2019) Events The Chicago Dragon Boat Race for Literacy, started in 1999, is a philanthropic event held annually at Ping Tom Memorial Park. Every summer, teams participate in a dragon boat race tournament organized by the Chicago Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, along the Chicago River while music, food and entertainment is provided for spectators. The race begins at the Canal Street railroad bridge, the only vertical-lift bridge on the Chicago River, and ends at the pavilion. The proceeds raised from the event are used to support and promote local literacy, cultural, and diversity programs. The park also acts as the finish line to the Chicago River Flatwater Classic, an annual canoe and kayak race. In 2004, the Chinatown Chamber of Commerce used hosted a free series of movies and concerts during their \\"Summer Fun in Chinatown\\" campaign. In late September, the Chicago-based Redmoon Theater performed Sink. Sank. Sunk..., an outdoor play at the park. The performance was the first in an annual series of site-specific plays created to introduce audiences to undiscovered, often- overlooked Chicago locations. The performance included floating props in the Chicago River and also incorporated the park's active, surrounding trains into the act. The Season 6 finale of CBS's reality show The Amazing Race ended in Ping Tom Memorial Park. Contestants were instructed to make their way to the Finish Line in the park from a Gino's East pizzeria; however, after contestants hailed taxis, most of the drivers did not know where the park was located.

Biography Plans of Charleville in 1625 Born in Paris, he was the son of Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers and Princess Henriette of Cleves.

In 1606, he decided the foundation of Charleville. and the Principality of Arches ( fr ) He became 1st Prince of Arche and Charleville In 1612, Charles, a descendant of the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus II Palaeologus through his grandmother Margaret, who was of the line of Theodore I, Marquess of Montferrat, Andronicus' son, claimed the throne of Constantinople, at the time the capital of the Ottoman Empire. He began plotting with Greek rebels, including the Maniots of Greece, who addressed him as \\"King Constantine Palaeologus\\". When the Ottoman authorities heard about this, they sent an army of 20,000 men and 70 ships to invade Mani. They succeeded in ravaging Mani and imposing taxes on the Maniots. This caused Charles to move more actively for his crusade. He sent envoys to the courts of Europe looking for support. In 1619, he recruited six ships and some five thousand men, but he was forced to abort the mission because of the beginning of the Thirty Years' War.Greenhalgh and Eliopoulos, Deep into Mani: Journey into the Southern Tip of Greece\\", 26 At the death of the last legitimate male heir of the Gonzaga line in the Duchy of Mantua, Vincenzo II (1627), Charles inherited the title through an agreement. His son was married with Maria Gonzaga, daughter of former Duke Francesco IV. However, his succession spurred the enmity of Charles Emmanuel I of Savoy, who aimed at the Gonzaga lands of Montferrat, and, above all, of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, which did not like a philo-French ruler in Mantua. This led to the War of the Mantuan Succession. In 1629 emperor Ferdinand II sent a Landsknecht army to besiege Mantua, Charles left without the promised support from Louis XIII of France. The siege lasted until July 1630, when the city, already struck by a plague, was brutally sacked. Mantua never recovered from this disaster. The subsequent diplomatic maneuvers allowed Charles, who had fled to the Papal States, to return to the duchy in 1631, although not without concessions to the House of Savoy and to the Gonzaga of Guastalla. The situation of the Mantuan lands was dramatic, but he was able to trigger some economic recovery in the following years. Charles died in 1637. His successor was his grandson Charles II, initially under the regency of Maria Gonzaga, Charles I's daughter-in-law.

Junkers F 24 was the designation for single-engine versions of the same aircraft. Design and development The increased German air traffic in the 1920s led to a requirement for a larger passenger transport aircraft. The G 24 was an enlarged development of the F 13. It was originally designed by Ernst Zindel as a single-engine aircraft. Under the restrictions imposed on aircraft in Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, only low powered engines were allowed. So the Junkers company designed their large G24 airliner to be single-engined, but built it as a tri-motor. With three low powered engines the G24 could fly, but was not a viable airliner. The plan was to sell the tri-motors to airlines outside of Germany, who would then install a single, high-powered engine (e.g. 450 hp Napier Lion) on the nose, and simply remove the wing center-section plugs that carried the other two engines. However the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control declared the G24 design to be a military type aircraft, and outlawed it. Junkers G.23 (CH-133) operated by Ad Astra AeroJunkers then resubmitted what was essentially the same design, but under a new designation: Junkers G23. The Allied Commission ultimately allowed Junkers to build the G23, even in the single engined version, because it was clearly an airline type. The plane was always marketed under the G24 designation. (This paragraph based on 'Wagner' pages 230‚Äì234) Junkers continued to build the G24/G23 as a tri-motor, because the ruse to circumvent the Allied restrictions also had the benefit that the plane could fly, and even climb, with one engine out. In 1925 most airliners were single-engined, since one big engine will usually be more efficient than several small ones. Twin-engine types could not maintain altitude with an engine out, unless they were so overpowered that the airlines could not afford to operate them. A tri-motor did not have to be so grossly overpowered, to be able to fly with one engine out. On May 1, 1926 newly formed German airline Deutsche Luft Hansa started flying passengers on the route Berlin ‚Äì K√∂nigsberg at night using G24 aircraft ('Wagner' page 232 'Seifert' page 376Karl-Dieter Seifert \\"Der deutsche Luftverkehr 1926 ‚Äì 1945 ‚Äì auf dem Weg zum Weltverkehr\\" Bernhard und Graefe Verlag, Bonn 1999 (in German)). This was the first time any airline, anywhere in the world, flew passengers at night. Previously airlines had flown only mail and freight after dark. If an engine failed, the pilot bailed out by parachute, since a forced landing in the dark is too dangerous. The Junkers G24 could carry passengers, since there would not be any forced landings. The G24s of Luft Hansa also had blind flying instruments and radio navigation (with the radio operator sitting in the passenger cabin, as there was no room in the open two seat cockpitGuenther Stauch (editor), \\"Das Gro√üe Buch der Lufthansa\\", Geramond Verlag, Munich 2003 (in German)). The aircraft was manufactured in three main batches, with different engine alternatives. Between 1925 and 1929, at least 72 aircraft were manufactured, 26 of which went to Luft Hansa. The G 24 managed to set a number of aviation records involving pay loads. Fritz Horn flew 2,020 km (1,256 mi) with a payload of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) on 14 h 23 min, having an average speed of 140 km/h (90 mph), setting a new world record. On 24 July 1926, two G 24s became famous after having flown the 20,000 km (12,400 mi) route between Berlin and Peking in just 10 stops. This flight ended on 8 September. It was initially meant that they would fly all the way to Shanghai, but they were prevented by military conflicts. On 26 September 1926, the two aircraft landed again in Berlin. Later during the year, a trans-Euro-Asiatic line was created. Luft Hansa, which operated the largest G 24 fleet in the world, decided to modify their G 24s to a single engine standard. The first modifications were done in March 1928. The wing was shortened and the center engine was replaced with a BMW VIU engine. Junkers called this aircraft F 24ko. A total of 11 G 24s were modified to F 24 standard between 1928 and 1930. By July 1933, most of these BMW-equipped F 24s were again modified with the new Jumo 4 and designated as F 24kay. Most of these F 24s remained in service at the beginning of World War II in 1939. Most of them were used by Luft Hansa as freighter aircraft. The Soviet-German aircraft cooperation in the 1920s led to a Soviet request for a new bomber aircraft. Junkers then designed the Junkers Ju 25 as a twin-engine bomber. But the development of this aircraft was too expensive for Junkers, especially since there were some difficulties with his Russian partners. Junkers then advised his lead designers ‚Äì Ernst Zindel and Hermann Pohlmann ‚Äì to design a military derivate of the G 24. By November 1924, the new aircraft was ready, and given the designation G3S1 24 and it was a direct modification of the G 24ba. The aircraft was said to be an air ambulance. Junkers followed up this design with several reconnaissance designs e.g. the G1Sa 24 which was a modified G 24 with only a single engine. The next design, the G2sB 24 was also a bomber, directly derived from the G 24he. This aircraft had a new center wing section and a new nose section, to allow an open shooting area to the forward areas. Junkers decided to produce this design as the general military version of the G 24 and gave it the designation K 30 in 1926. In 1926, the Finnish airline Aero O/Y acquired a Junkers G 24, which went into service on the Stockholm route. The aircraft was equipped with floats, but not skis, and so could be used in summer only. It remained in service until 1935. A Swedish G 24 also participated in the rescue of the unfortunate Italian Umberto Nobile expedition to the North pole. This was the first time an aircraft had flown over the Arctic Sea without stops. =Military versions= Junkers R 42 photo from L'A√©ronautique October,1926 Junkers offered the K 30 design to the Soviet forces, which ordered a total of 23 K 30s in 1925 and 1926. A production line for the military version K 30 was set up at A.B. Flygindustri at Limhamn in Sweden as the German aviation industry was prevented from building military aircraft in 1926. The parts for the K 30 aircraft were built at Dessau and then shipped to Limhamn, where A.B. Flygindustri built the K 30 under the designation R 42. Some of the R 42s were equipped with machine gun towers and bomb mountings. But several of the R 42s were also shipped without military equipment to Russia. These were later fitted with military equipment at Junkers' factory in Fili, Moscow. The R 42/K 30 was designated JuG-1 in the Soviet Union. They received five 7.62 mm (.30 in) machine guns and could carry a bomb load of 500 kg (1,100 lb). This version was used to rescue the expedition of downed balloonist General Umberto Nobile in 1928. Six more R 42s were delivered to Chile during 1926 plus three K 30s to Spain and two K 30s to Yugoslavia until 1931. The Spanish and Yugoslavian aircraft were produced at Dessau. The K 30 was equipped with either wheels, skis or floats. With the successful conversion of the G 24 into the single-engine aircraft F 24, Junkers was also thinking about a single-engine K 30 in 1931. Like the F 24, this K30do was to be equipped with the Jumo 4 engine and was similar to the initial G1Sa 24. However, no single-engine K 30s were built.

The aircraft was manufactured in 1925 as a three-engined G 24 and was converted to an F 24kay in December 1931 as a test bed for the Junkers Jumo 4 engine. In 1936 the aircraft was re-engined with a Daimler-Benz DB 600 V12 for test flights, and a DB 601 V12 in 1938 for 200 hours of test flying, and it was during one of these test flights that the engine caught fire, leading to the crash.

Airmanship covers a broad range of desirable behaviors and abilities in an aviator. It is not simply a measure of skill or technique, but also a measure of a pilot‚Äôs awareness of the aircraft, the environment in which it operates, and of his\\\\her own capabilities. :Airmanship is defined by the US FAA as: :*A sound acquaintance with the principles of flight, :*The ability to operate an airplane with competence and precision both on the ground and in the air, and :*The exercise of sound judgment that results in optimal operational safety and efficiency. A review paper presented at a NATO research and training symposium on military aviation human factors defined airmanship as \\"a personal state that enables aircrew to exercise sound judgment, display uncompromising flight discipline and demonstrate skillful control of an aircraft and a situation. It is maintained by continuous self-improvement and a desire to perform optimally at all times.\\" Combining modern academic and industry definitions, it's accepted now that airmanship is a multi-dimensional concept involving skilful control of an aircraft, making good decisions about the flight, and is tightly linked to flight discipline. The three fundamental principles of expert airmanship are skill, proficiency, and the discipline to apply them in a safe and efficient manner. Discipline is the foundation of airmanship. The complexity of the aviation environment demands a foundation of solid airmanship, and a healthy, positive approach to combating pilot error. The actions of Captain Alfred C. Haynes and the crew of United Airlines Flight 232 are often cited as an exemplar of good airmanship. They were able to maintain control of their crippled McDonnell Douglas DC-10, bringing it to a survivable \\"controlled crash\\" in Sioux City, Iowa, after a complete loss of all flight controls following an engine failure in July 1989. They did this by improvising a control scheme on the spot using differential engine thrust on the two working engines. Captain Haynes credited his Crew Resource Management training as one of the key factors that saved his own life, and many others.Haynes' Eyewitness account The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board occasionally cites poor airmanship as a contributing factor in its determination of probable cause in aviation accidents, although it is implicit in many of the pilot error causes it often uses. For example, in its report on the December 1, 1993, fatal crash of Northwest Airlink Flight 5719, the NTSB determined the \\"failure of the company management to adequately address the previously identified deficiencies in airmanship\\" was a contributing factor. More recently, in the February 2, 2005 business jet accident at Teterboro Airport, NTSB investigator Steve Demko, speaking about the probable cause, said determining an aircraft's weight and balance before takeoff is \\"basic airmanship,\\" a \\"Flying 101 type of thing.\\" And in the 2006 New York City plane crash that killed New York Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle, the NTSB cited \\"inadequate judgement, planning and airmanship\\" in its probable cause determination. A \\"failure of airmanship\\" was also cited by Maurice Baril, investigating the Tarnak Farm incident in Afghanistan, where the pilot of a U.S. F-16 Fighting Falcon mistakenly targeted a laser-guided bomb on training Canadian troops in April 2003, killing four of them. Airmanship covers operation of the aircraft and all its systems, so in military usage, this includes the weapons systems of combat aircraft.

He founded the New York City pro-am basketball tournament, that still bears his name and is the namesake of a world-famous basketball court in Harlem. Rucker, who grew up in Manhattan, started the tournament in 1950 at a playground on 7th Avenue between 128th and 129th streets. He insisted that education be a fundamental part of the Rucker League, in keeping with its motto ‚Äî \\"Each one, teach one.\\" Through his efforts, over 700 individuals were able to obtain basketball scholarships to help finance their education. The tournament grew into the stuff of legend in the 1960s, when many NBA stars such as Wilt Chamberlain participated. Rucker attended City College of New York and graduated in 1962 with a degree in Education. He went on to teach English at J.H.S. 139 before he died of cancer in 1965 at age 38. In 1974 the city renamed P.S. 156 Playground, located at 155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, as Holcombe Rucker Playground in dedication to his community efforts. Rucker's basketball tournament had moved there in 1965, and Holcombe Rucker Basketball Court ‚Äî now arguably the most famous street court in the world ‚Äî remains a proving ground for the region's most talented players.

If the person is strapped into a harness or tied to an upright object they will eventually suffer the central ischaemic response (commonly known as fainting). Fainting while remaining vertical increases the risk of death from cerebral hypoxia.Seddon P.: Harness suspension: review and evaluation of existing information. In: Health and Safety Executive - CONTRACT RESEARCH REPORT 451/2002, page 3, hier online Since there is no evidence that these effects are specifically due to trauma, or caused by the harness itself, climbing medicine authorities have argued against the terminology of suspension trauma or harness hang syndrome and instead termed this simply \\"suspension syndrome\\". Hawkins SC, Simon RB, Beissinger JP, Simon D. Vertical Aid: Essential Wilderness Medicine for Climbers, Trekkers, and Mountaineers. New York: The Countryman Press, 2017. People at risk of suspension trauma include people using industrial harnesses (fall arrest systems, abseiling systems, confined space systems), people using harnesses for sporting purposes (caving, climbing, parachuting, etc.), stunt performers, circus performers, and occupations that require the use of harnesses and suspension systems in general. Suspension shock can also occur in medical environments, for similar reasons. In the UK the term \\"suspension trauma\\" has been replaced by \\"syncope\\" or \\"pre-syncope\\" as \\"trauma\\" suggests that there has been a physical injury that has resulted in the fallen person becoming unconscious. In the circumstances where a person has fallen into suspension on a rope/lanyard and has become unconscious, it is thought that the unconscious state \\"syncope\\" is due to a combination of orthostasis or motionless vertical suspension, with \\"pre-syncope\\" being the state before the person becomes unconscious where the fallen person may experience symptoms such as light-headedness; nausea; sensations of flushing; tingling or numbness of the arms or legs; anxiety; visual disturbance; or faintness. HSE Research Report RR708 2009 1 Introduction page 5 paragraphs 1 and 3 refers. Cause The most common cause is accidents in which the person remains motionless suspended in a harness for longer periods of time. Motionlessness may have several causes including fatigue, hypoglycemia, hypothermia or traumatic brain injury. Symptoms Onset of symptoms may be after just a few minutes, but usually occurs after at least 20 minutes of free hanging. Typical symptoms are pallor, sweating, shortness of breath, blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, hypotension and numbness of the legs. Eventually it leads to fainting, which may result in death due to oxygen deprivation of the brain. Treatment If someone is stranded in a harness, but is not unconscious or injured, and has something to kick against or stand on (such as a rock ledge or caving leg- loops) it is helpful for them to use their leg muscles by pushing against it every so often, to keep the blood pumping back to the torso. If the person is stranded in mid-air or is exhausted, then keeping the legs moving can be both beneficial and rather dangerous. On the one hand, exercising the leg muscles will keep the blood returning to the torso, but on the other hand, as the movements become weaker the leg muscles will continue to demand blood yet they will become much less effective at returning it to the body, and the moment the victim ceases moving their legs, the blood will immediately start to pool. \\"Pedaling an imaginary bicycle\\" should only be used as a last-ditch effort to prolong consciousness, because as soon as the \\"pedaling\\" stops, fainting will shortly follow. If it is impossible to rescue someone immediately, then it is necessary to raise their legs to a sitting position, which can be done with a loop of rigging tape behind the knees or specialized equipment from a rescue kit. When workers are suspended in their safety harnesses for long periods, they may suffer from blood pooling in the lower body. This can lead to suspension trauma. Once a worker is back on the ground after a fall has been arrested on a fall protection system, a worker should be placed in the ‚ÄúW‚Äù position. The ‚ÄúW‚Äù position is where a worker sits upright on the ground with their back/chest straight and their legs bent so that their knees are in line with the bottom of their chin. For added stability, make sure that the worker‚Äôs feet stay flat on the ground. In this position, a KED board can still be used if there are any potential spinal injuries and a worker needs stabilization before transport. Once the worker is in this position, they will need to stay in that position for at least 30 minutes. Try to leave the worker in this position until their symptoms begin to subside. The time in the ‚ÄúW‚Äù position will allow the pooled blood from the legs to be slowly re-introduced back into the body. By slowing the rate at which the pooled blood reaches different organs, you are giving the body more of an opportunity to filter the pooled blood and maintain internal homeostasis. http://www.rigidlifelines.com/blog/entry/suspension-traumasymptoms-and- treatment Prevention Prevention of suspension trauma is preferable to dealing with its consequences. Specific recommendations for individuals doing technical ropework are to avoid exhausting themselves so much that they end up without the energy to keep moving, and making sure everyone in a group is trained in single rope rescue techniques, especially the \\"single rope pickoff\\", a rather difficult technical maneuver that must be practiced frequently for smooth performance.

Structure  No full structure for SLP-76 has been solved. The PDB file 1H3H depicts the SH3 domain of GRAP2 in complex with an RSTK-containing peptide representing residues 226‚Äì235 of SLP-76.  Function  SLP-76 was originally identified as a substrate of the ZAP-70 protein tyrosine kinase following T cell receptor (TCR) ligation in the leukemic T cell line Jurkat. The SLP-76 locus has been localized to human chromosome 5q33 and the gene structure has been partially characterized in mice. The human and murine cDNAs both encode 533 amino acid proteins that are 72% identical and composed of three modular domains. The NH2-terminus contains an acidic region that includes a PEST domain and several tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated following TCR ligation. SLP-76 also contains a central proline-rich domain and a COOH-terminal SH2 domain. A number of additional proteins have been identified that associate with SLP-76 both constitutively and inducibly following receptor ligation, supporting the notion that SLP-76 functions as an adaptor or scaffold protein. Studies using SLP-76-deficient T cell lines or mice have provided strong evidence that SLP-76 plays a positive role in promoting T cell development and activation as well as mast cell and platelet function. SLP-76 might serve as an integration point for signals by activating NK cell receptors. In NK cells, SLP-76 can be phosphorylated by SYK or ZAP70 following ligation of activating receptors.

The revue contained satirical sketches and witty or poignant musical numbers, several of which became standards, including \\"Heat Wave\\", \\"Easter Parade\\" and \\"Harlem on my Mind\\". The sketches were loosely based on the news and the lives and affairs of the rich and famous, and other people of the day, such as Joan Crawford, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., No√´l Coward, Josephine Baker, and Aimee Semple McPherson. History The revue was a successor to the creators' Face the Music and was Marilyn Miller's last stage appearance before her death. It was also the first Broadway show to give an African-American star, Ethel Waters, equal billing with whites. Moss Hart said that he and Irving Berlin did not want to write the typical revue with \\"blackout sketches\\" and musical numbers, and they had the idea of doing a topical revue \\"right off the front pages of the newspapers.\\" Berlin deferred his own fees as composer, lyricist, and theater owner, keeping the cost of the show to a \\"restrained\\" $96,000.Bergreen, p. 313. Synopsis Each of the 21 scenes was preceded by a related newspaper headline, and the sketches poked fun a wide variety of subjects, including the marital woes of Barbara Hutton, Gandhi, and British royalty. The weather report was turned into a song (\\"Heat Wave\\").Bergreen, pp. 189 and 314. Other notable scenes include President and Mrs. Hoover leaving the White House, with the President giving his cabinet a Bronx cheer; \\"Supper Time\\", an African- American woman's lament for her lynched husband; John D. Rockefeller refusing to accept Radio City Music Hall as a birthday gift; commercials interrupting the singing during a Metropolitan Opera broadcast (P.D.Q. Bach later did this); a hotel staff falling under the influence of No√´l Coward; and a fictional Supreme Court decision that says musicals cannot end with reprises, resulting in a new number, \\"Not For All The Rice In China\\" (satirizing Barbara Hutton's relationship with Alexis Mdivani), as a finale.Boardman, Gerald.

It was staged by Hassard Short with choreography by Charles Weidman. The musical starred Helen Broderick, Marilyn Miller, Clifton Webb and Ethel Waters, and featured Jos√© Lim√≥n as the lead dancer. The London-based version of the show, retitled Stop Press, opened on February 21, 1935 at the Adelphi Theatre. In 1934, Dorothy Stone took over the roles played by Miller. The Drama Department presented the revue at the off- Broadway Greenwich House Theater from June 2, 1998 through June 14, 1998.

The buildings (The Towers on Capitol Mall I & II) were planned to have 804 condominia, a 200 room InterContinental Hotel, and ground floor retail. Rumoured retailers include Gucci, Prada, Kenneth Cole and Tiffany & Co. The Towers are notable due to the massive scope and scale of the building, and it would have easily surpassed the city's current tallest building, the 423 foot (129 m) Wells Fargo Center. The project had been on hold since January 7, 2007 due to liens being filed against developer John Saca, totaling $7.3 million. Calpers and Deustche Bank have been the primary financial support for the project, however stipulating conditions have led to the collapse of the project. CalPERS is now teaming up with Los Angeles-based CIM to develop the downtown Sacramento block into a similar but smaller high-rise construction project consisting of a hotel, condominia and office space. The project would incorporate the original foundation piles that were driven into the bedrock in 2006 to support the weight of the 615-foot (187 m) skyscrapers. Location The Towers would have been located at the address 301 Capitol Mall, a prominent location near the Tower Bridge and within a few blocks from the California State Capitol which at one time was home to the Sacramento Union newspaper.

He repaired his first guitar in 1952 and built his first instrument ‚Äìa classical nylon-string guitar in 1955.Tony Z and the Cult of the Zemaitis Guitar by Adrian Ingram on Vintage Guitar magazine, August 1997 Zemaitis started to build guitars for his friends, selling them the instruments at lower prices. After doing the military service, Zemaitis improved his methods to manufacture guitars. His instruments became popular in blues and folk music musicians of London, gaining good reputation among them. During the 1960s, Zemaitis made 12-string guitars for notable musicians including Ralph McTell, Spencer Davis, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix.A.C. Zemaitis guitars history on Zemaitis.de After starting to build acoustic guitars, Zemaitis began to manufacture electric models, with some prototypes used by George Harrison. Other musicians that asked Zemaitis for guitars were Mark Bolan, Ron Wood and Ronnie Lane. Pearl front guitar Zemaitis' characteristic metal front guitar was designed to reduce the humming of the electric guitars. His first metal-front was made for Tony McPhee, of The Groundhogs in the late 1960s. Inspiration for metal-fronts came for his observation of Fender guitars, upon which he considered they have design faults relating the position of the pickups in relationship to the strings. Zemaitis took the model from a radio magazine, where he noted that every unit had a metal chassis with the components mounted on it. Applying that principle to his guitar, he produced the first metal-front guitar. Metal front guitars also included an engraved designs made by his friend and customer Danny O'Brien, who had started engraving plates for guitars headstock until Zemaitis himself suggested O'Brian to engrave the fronts, as well. Zemaitis' guitars became popular among rock artist and consolidated as a landmark of Zemaitis guitars.Legacy on Zemaitis Japan website (translated from Japanese), 28 Oct 2019 In the mid-1970s, Zemaitis made his first \\"mother of pearl\\" fronts for Ronnie Wood and James Honeyman Scott. Although Tony Zemaitis died in 2002, the demand for his guitars continued increasing, as well as their prices. The \\"Zemaitis\\" licensed guitars started to be manufactured in Japan, while many guitar makers worldwide copying Tony Zemaitis' designs to their own products.  Notable players  Zemaitis has had many notable players use their guitars throughout the years such as Ronnie Wood, James Hetfield, Ronnie Lane, Keith Richards, Rich Robinson, Keith Nelson and Gilby Clark.

These structures and relationships function as a result of dynamic self-management, involving the continuity of participation and exchange between individuals to achieve the larger desired outcomes of the collective whole. Origin As a specific term, horizontalidad is attributed to the radical movements that sprouted in December 2001, in Argentina, after the economic crisis. According to Marina Sitrin, it is a new social creation. Different from many social movements of the past, it rejected political programs, opting instead to create directly democratic spaces and new social relationship.Ruptures in imagination: Horizontalism, autogestion and affective politics in Argentina . By Marina Sitrin. Centre for Global Education The related term \\"horizontals\\" arose during the anti-globalisation European Social Forum in London in 2004 to describe people organising in a style where they \\"aspire to an open relationship between participants, whose deliberative encounters (rather than representative status) form the basis of any decisions,\\" in contrast to \\"verticals\\" who \\"assume the existence and legitimacy of representative structures, in which bargaining power is accrued on the basis of an electoral mandate (or any other means of selection to which the members of an organisation assent)\\". Horizontalidad is related to the theories of communist anarchism, social ecology and libertarian municipalism, autonomist Marxism and participatory economics.Sitrin, Marina (ed.). \\"Horizontalidad.\\" Horizontalism: Voices of Popular Power in Argentina. AK Press, 2006, p. 37‚Äì66. . According to these schools of thought, horizontality seems to be a necessary factor for real freedom because it allows personal autonomy within a framework of social equality. These approaches advocate a kind of socialist direct democracy and workers' councils (autogestion) or community/neighborhood councils. According to Paul Mason, \\"the power of the horizontalist movements is, first, their replicability by people who know nothing about theory, and secondly, their success in breaking down the hierarchies that seek to contain them. They are exposed to a montage of ideas, in a way that the structured, difficult-to- conquer knowledge of the 1970s and 1980s did not allow (...) The big question for horizontalist movements is that as long as you don‚Äôt articulate against power, you‚Äôre basically doing what somebody has called \\"reform by riot\\":From an anonymous manifesto that circulated by e-mail among Occupy London protesters, in October, 2011: \\"(...) reform by riot ‚Äì a division of labour by which a kid in a hoodie goes to prison for two years and a man in a suit gains sudden acceptance of his liberal reform plans ‚Äì is as long as the history of capitalism.\\" a guy in a hoodie goes to jail for a year so that a guy in a suit can get his law through parliament\\".Tweetin' 'bout a revolution: Paul Mason talks about Why It‚Äôs Kicking Off Everywhere: the new global revolutions and horizontalist movements.

He was born in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and learned to tap dance on the street corners of Philadelphia. When Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson died in 1949, LeRoy Myers and some close friends were inspired to form the Copasetics, named after Bill Robinsons' favorite expression, \\"Everything is Copasetic.\\" The Copasetics was a fraternity of black entertainers that were influential in the revival of tap dancing in the late 1970s through the 1980s. LeRoy Myers was elected as the club's first president. The original membership included Billy Strayhorn, James \\"Chuckles\\" Walker, Charles \\"Cookie\\" Cook, Luther \\"Slim\\" Preston, Henry \\"Phace\\" Roberts, Johnny Rocket, Pete Nugent, Honi Coles, Cholly Atkins, Peg Leg Bates, Ernest Brown, Milton Larkin, Francis Goldberg, Frank Goldberg, Emory Evans, Elmer Waters, Roy Branker, Paul Black, Eddie West, and Chink Collins. LeRoy Myers moved to New York City in the 1930s and was the producer of the weekly tap jam sessions at the Showmans Jazz Club in Harlem. He was the recipient of the 2004 Honi Coles Reward and was going to be honored during Tap Extravaganza 2004 on May 30. He died a month before the Tap Extravaganza from cancer at the age of 84. To commemorate his accomplishments, on March 11, 2006 the LeRoy Myers Corner street sign, on the northeast corner of 122nd Street and Manhattan Avenue in New York City, was unveiled by LeRoy's only surviving brother, Walter Myers. The ceremony was attended by about 20 relatives that had traveled from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as well as Harold \\"Stumpy\\" Cromer of the tap team Stump and Stumpy, dancer Norma Miller, and many others. LeRoy Myers was an honorary board member of the Tap Legacy Foundation (TLF). On May 25, 2006, a commemorative plaque honoring the memory of LeRoy Myers was presented at Showmans by TLF.

Titanium dioxide is a heterogeneous photocatalyst that uses sunlight to absorb and render oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO2) harmless by converting them to nitrate ions (NO3‚àí), which are then either washed away by rain or soaked into the concrete to form stable compounds. Mechanism When titanium dioxide is exposed to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, it absorbs the radiation and electron excitation occurs. The following reactions then occur on the surface of the titanium dioxide crystals: Photolysis of water: : H2O ‚Üí H+ \\\\+ OH (hydroxyl radical) + e‚àí : O2 \\\\+ e‚àí ‚Üí O2‚àí (a superoxide ion) The overall reaction is therefore: : H2O + O2 ‚Üí H+ \\\\+ O2‚àí \\\\+ OH The hydroxyl radical is a powerful oxidizing agent and can oxidize nitrogen dioxide to nitrate ions: : NO2 \\\\+ OH ‚Üí H+ \\\\+ NO3‚àí The superoxide ion is also able to form nitrate ions from nitrogen monoxide: : NO + O2‚àí ‚Üí NO3‚àí The oxidation of NOx to nitrate ions occurs very slowly under normal atmospheric conditions because of the low concentrations of the reactions. The photochemical oxidation with the aid of titanium dioxide is much faster because of the energy absorbed by the coating on the block and also because the reactants are held together on the surface of the block. The reaction using titanium dioxide shows a greater oxidizing power than most other metal-based catalysts. Noxer blocks have replaced ordinary paving in around 30 towns in Japan, originally having been tested in Osaka in 1997 and can also be found underfoot in the City of Westminster (London). The noxer blocks aim to reduce these pollution levels and therefore lower the amount of photochemical smog.

He began his instrument making training at age 13, and studied making and restoration under Peter Prier, Carl Becker and Ren√© Morel. Since 1985 he has been based in Brooklyn, New York. His early work demonstrates expert skill as a copyist of classic instruments. Later work includes personal models informed by intensive advanced research. Findings from this research have been published in numerous print and digital media. Zygmuntowicz is an active fiddler, playing with several folk music groups. His playing can be heard on the recordings Grand Picnic, and Jump When the Trumpets Blow. Zygmuntowicz was born in Philadelphia to Jewish Holocaust survivors from Poland. He is a graduate of the Violin Making School of America in Salt Lake City (1976‚Äì80) during which time he also worked for Carl Becker. In 1980, a Becker-style Stradivari violin copy made by Zygmuntowicz won two gold medals - for violin workmanship and tone - at the Violin Society of America Competition. The same year, Zygmuntowicz began five years of additional training in the restoration workshop of Jacques Fran√ßais Rare Violins, Inc. and Ren√© A. Morel. Isaac Stern owned two Zygmuntowicz violins. After Stern died in 2001, both violins were sold at a Tarisio auction in 2003, each violin surpassing the previous record for the highest price paid for a string instrument by a living maker at auction, until the record was broken in October 2013. His clients include Leila Josefowicz, Yo-Yo Ma, David Finckel, Cho-Liang Lin, Maxim Vengerov, Joshua Bell, and the Emerson String Quartet. In their 2008 recording of Bach fugues, the Emerson String Quartet all played Zygmuntowicz instruments. The Violinmaker, a book written by John Marchese, chronicles the making of a violin for Emerson String Quartet violinist Eugene Drucker. Zygmuntowicz has published several analyses of great classic instruments, including the 'Duport' cello, 'Titian', and 'Huberman' violins of Stradivari, the 'Plowden' Guarneri 'del Gesu' violin, and a 1796 Mantegazza viola. Strad3D Since 2006, Zygmuntowicz has been the creative director of the Strad3D project, which The Strad Library called \\"One of the most groundbreaking and comprehensive studies of the violin form ever conceived.\\" It involved the first 3D laser vibration scanning of Stradivari and Guarneri violins, (the 'Titian' and 'Willemotte' Stradivaris, and the 'Plowden' Guarneri 'del Gesu') and included acoustic testing and CT scanning. Zygmuntowicz turned the endeavor into a broad collaborative project, bringing together makers, musicians, filmmakers, acoustical engineers, and other researchers - among them physicist and co-developer George Bissinger, who had pioneered the use of vibration scanning using lasers. According to Zygmuntowicz, \\"The instruments were gently activated by tapping the bridge, and then three scanning lasers detected the resulting patterns of vibration, which were revealed on screen as a rippling landscape of colour and motion, rather like a motion-capture animated film.\\" The result was the first three-dimensional motion capture of violins in use. The practical value of these scientific investigations continues to emerge. Initial findings were published in an article appearing in the January 2009 issue of The Strad.  Teaching, Public Speaking, and Outreach  Zygmuntowicz is an active speaker at museums, conferences, and chamber music festivals, and intensive workshops, on topics ranging from historical and contemporary violin-making techniques to modern violin acoustics and cutting-edge research. Recent engagements include, The National Museum of Mathematics (MoMath) in 2016, Lake Champlain Chamber Music Festival of 2015-16, Music@Menlo Festival of 2017, The 2018 La Jolla SummerFest, Banff String Quartet Competition of 2013, The 2012 EG Conference, and yearly appearances at the Oberlin Acoustics Workshop, and at the Juilliard School in NY. These presentations have been adapted to the various interests of the general public, active string players, scientific researchers, and experienced luthiers.

It is also known as blue-throated parakeet, and red-eared conure in English and cotorra tiriba and perico grande in Spanish. It is listed as Vulnerable (VU) on the IUCN Red List. Description This colourful parakeet is a predominantly green bird with conspicuous red patches on its belly, rump, and shoulder and before, below and behind the eye. The crown is dark brown to blackish, becoming mottled on the nape of the neck, and there is a broad, bright blue bib on the chest, extending thinly around the back of the neck to form a faint collar. The outer primaries are blue, and the tail is olive-green above, and brownish red below. Habitat It inhabits the canopy of lowland humid forest and edge, occasionally up to 960 meters. It has also been recorded in small clearings and selectively logged forest, and persists (or at least persisted) in agricultural areas where many forest trees are retained (such as shade cocoa plantations). It feeds on seeds and fruit of secondary growth trees such as Trema micrantha and Cecropia. Feeding on agricultural crops has not been observed in the wild. Breeding apparently occurs in the austral spring, when 2‚Äì4 eggs are laid in a tree-cavity. Distribution Pyrrhura cruentata was formerly common throughout much of south-east Bahia, Esp√≠rito Santo, east Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Its current distribution is highly fragmented and now mostly restricted to isolated reserves. The stronghold is the Sooretama Biological Reserve and adjacent Linhares Forest Reserve, Esp√≠rito Santo. It remains common in Esta√ß√£o Vera Cruz (formerly the Porto Seguro Reserve), Bahia. Elsewhere it can be relatively common, but numbers in the large Chapada da Diamantina and Monte Pascoal National Parks, Bahia, appear low. Population The population is estimated at 4.8 to 41 individuals per square kilometer times 1030 square kilometers for a total between 4944 and 42,230 individuals. It is best placed within the band 2500‚Äì9999 individuals.(Marsden et al. [2000]). Threats Extensive and continuing forest clearance is responsible for its current fragmented distribution. Its apparent tolerance of shade cacao plantations provides little hope because shading techniques since the 1980s have involved the use of banana and Erythryna trees, rather than standing forest, and unstable prices have resulted in conversion to pasture. Many remaining populations are now affected by site-specific threats such as conflicts between habitat conservation and the rights of local communities in Monte Pascoal National Park. Trapping for the cage-bird trade is a relatively new phenomenon, but the species is rare in national and international markets. Conservation efforts The bird is listed on CITES Appendix I and II and is protected by Brazilian law. It occurs in the Chapada Diamantina and Monte Pascoal National Parks, Barrol√¢ndia Experimental Station, Linhares Forest Reserve, Caratinga Biological Station, Rio Doce and probably Desengano State Parks, and the C√≥rrego Grande, C√≥rrego do Veado and Sooretama Biological Reserves.

The village is first mentioned in a charter of the Monastery of S. Savino in year 780. The village is surrounded by olive groves. There are three churches in Montemagno. The oldest one is S. Martino, not any longer within the village proper (see below). In 1021 walls were erected around the village, but S. Martino was a few hundred meters away and left out. Within the walls a new church was erected in 1076 (the belltower was founded in 1786 and finished in 1811). The new church is named Santa Maria della Neve. The village continued to develop around the new church, and the old one was abandoned. The third church is a chapel and is named Chiesino di S. Rocco. It was erected in 1632 by the 90 grateful surviving inhabitants after the plague in 1630 took 272 lives in the village. In 1880, the comune of Montemagno was integrated into the comune of Calci.

He is best known for his frescoes, which decorate many of the churches and monasteries along the Upper Swabian Baroque Route. The frescoes in the Zwiefalten Abbey are considered his masterpiece.Germany: A Phaidon Cultural Guide. Oxford: Phaidon, 1985. pp. 775-776\\\\. . Spiegler was born the Free Imperial City of Wangen im Allg√§u, the son of a district court attorney. After the death of his father in 1692, his mother married the painter Adam Joseph Dollmann, a member of an old patrician family in Wangen. This was Spiegler's introduction to the arts. Around 1710 Spiegler began training as a painter in Munich under the tutelage of his great-uncle, the Bavarian court painter Johann Kaspar Sing. During the course of his studies, Spiegler also became acquainted with the historical painting in vogue with the Dutch painters of the time. From 1723 to 1725 Spiegler painted frescoes in the Ottobeuren Abbey that show the strong influence of the Italian painter Jacopo Amigoni (1682-1752).

This Colony has mainly two sub-colonies - a government colony and a private colony. The government colony has Type-I and Type-II flats and few type 3 flats above i block market under General Pool Residential Accommodation of Central Government maintained by CPWD, and residents here are employees of various Central and attached government offices and their family members. History The private colony was initially developed as J.J.Colony Sriniwaspuri. The original residents of this JJ Colony had been residing at Bela Road Jhuggi Basti near Rajghat and were Rajasthani and Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Janghi. Being poor, they had been working in and around the Purani Delhi area, the Yamuna area, etc. Most of them were labourers, masons, etc. In 1961, due to a fire accident this Juggi Basti had burnt. Pt. Jawahar Lal Nehru, then the Prime Minister of India, allotted 80 Sq. Yds Plots with a loan of Rs.1000 to every family to build homes. First, 94 Plots in J Block were allotted to Rajasthani families, and Blocks K, L, M, N and O were allotted to the remaining people. Punjabi/Multani/Sindhi/Jhangi people were largest at that time too. Therefore, it is clear that most of the original residents of Sriniwaspuri residing in Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O have been residing in Sriniwaspuri since 1961, and they may have been residing in Delhi since 1951 or earlier. Thereafter, local people and other people came in this Colony and encroached upon the land, resulting in the more recent P, Q, R, S, and T blocks. The difference may be seen easily that on one hand J.J. Colony having Blocks J, K, L, M, N, and O has well planned roads and buildings, whereas Blocks P, Q, R, S, and T are congested. This part is also known as the private colony extension. The private colony extension of Sriniwaspuri grapples with basic issues such as water supply, electricity, and encroachment. This part of Sriniwaspuri has many unregulated businesses such as provisional stores, dairies, and confectionery shops. Over the years, the place has commercialised so much that many residents have started leaving the place. Sriniwaspuri has its own Public Library in Grih Kalyan Kendra (opp. Cambridge school where very good level of badminton is also played at indoor by players like nishant, yash, prateek, lakshya, tarik, yogeshwar, manav, aseem and many other players), Post Office and Police Chowki under Amar Colony police state earlier it had own Police Station, and it also has the famous Bharat Sevasharam Mandir (Hathi Wala Mandir). There is also a CGHS Dispensary, MCD Allopathic Dispensary, MCD Maternity Centre, MCD Homoeopatic Dispensary, MCD Unani Dispensary. The town has several parks (Parks in Government Colony type-II flats are is only well maintained other of them are not seems to be maintained ) for children to play. Most weekends, the play grounds are a sight to watch as you get to see multiple cricket teams playing on the same ground at same time. The town has government run primary and secondary schools separately for boys and girls. Government Boys School is called as G.B.Pant Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya. Girls schools have good discipline and reputation. It seems that there is no discipline in G.B. Pant Boys School because the students may be seen wandering everywhere in school timing frequently in groups wasting their time. School Administration has not seems to be worried about the future of its students (It has happen all after a great Principle of school 'Prem sigh' has leaved the school). There is one private school called Cambridge School it is one of the best school in South Delhi. There is also one Arya Samaj Vidyalaya maintained by Arya Samaj Mandir. There are 3 famous parks here, an ideal for cricketers. these are TOURNAMENT 1, TOURNAMENT 2 and TOURNAMENT 3. TOURNAMENT 1 is also used to arrange marriages. Now the condition of sriniwaspuri is improving. It is also under the plan of redevelopment with 6 other places of Delhi. Under this plan even the private citizens may soon be able to buy homes and offices in these colonies.

The book is written in the first person from the point of view of unreliable narrator Maxim Arturovitch Pyatnitski, whose posthumous notes Moorcock claims to have transcribed. Pyat, as he is also known, describes in the novel his adventures in Tsarist then Revolutionary Russia. Born on 1 January 1900 in Kiev, Pyat dreams from early on of becoming a great inventor and engineer. His widowed mother, lacking any means to support his higher education, sends him at age 16 to a relative in Odessa, where Pyat is introduced to bohemian life, cocaine and sexual adventures. Making a good impression on his relative, he secures a position at a technical university in St. Petersburg. After having failed to obtain a degree, he returns to Kiev, where he manages to profit from his knowledge of machinery and runs a successful repair enterprise. The revolutionary and post revolutionary civil war bring him again to Odessa; on the way, he aligns with whatever group is in power. Finally, he manages to escape by ship to western Europe. Throughout all his wanderings, Pyat will not pass over any opportunity for self-aggrandisement, despite being a genuinely despicable character. The character appears to have been addicted to cocaine and sex. He is also obsessively antisemitic despite multiple hints that his father was Jewish.

The parking and access area for Wahclella Falls is slightly down the hill and to the right (for eastbound traffic) of the entrance to the dam. Wahclella is at the midpoint of the well maintained trail number 436 loop that forms a roundtrip. The falls are divided into upper and lower segments with a combined height of , the upper section is not completely visible while the fully visible lower segment stands in height as it thunders out of a narrow gorge carved through dark gray basalt. The plunge pool has a picturesque quality due to the surrounding natural walls that form a semi- circular rotunda extending from the falls to the main vantage point. As with most waterfalls, Wahclella does exhibit some seasonality of water flow. However, because Tanner Creek is sourced primarily by an underground spring, the flow is never dramatically affected by adverse weather. Wahclella Falls was named after a nearby village of Native Americans by the Mazama mountaineering club in 1915. Although Wahclella Falls is its officially recognized name, the United States Geological Survey still records the waterfall as Tanner Creek Falls. The United States Forest Service charges a fee or requires a pass for parking at the trail head.

It was a development of the Saro-Percival Mailplane for passenger use. Design and development The Saro-Percival Mailplane was a three-engined monoplane mail plane designed by Edgar Percival, and built by Saunders-Roe Limited (Saro) at Cowes in 1931, the aircraft first flying early in 1932. It was a low-winged monoplane, with a wooden wingCruiser wing under construction and plywood fuselage, and was powered by three 120 hp de Havilland Gipsy III engines.Flight 10 July 1931 When Saro was financially re-organised, Percival sold his interest in the aircraft to Saro, who re- designated it as the Saro A.24 Mailplane. Due to the close ties between Saro and Spartan Aircraft, the development of the aircraft was transferred to Spartan, and the aircraft was re-designated again as the Spartan Mailplane.Jackson (1988), pp.188-191. The aircraft was modified to accommodate two passenger seats. Starting on 15 June 1932, the Mailplane (G-ABLI) flew from Stanley Park Aerodrome (Blackpool) to Karachi, India taking a total of 5 days 23 hours 50 minutes.Lowe (1994), pp.52-53. The Mailplane had seen no commercial interest, so the design was re-worked as a passenger carrier. This re-designed aircraft was designated the Spartan Cruiser, and the prototype (G-ABTY) first flew in May 1932, piloted by Louis Strange. The original three- engined low-wing format had been retained, but the plywood fuselage was replaced with an all-metal fuselage to carry six passengers and two crew. Just one example was built of the basic Cruiser (G-ABTY, later known as the Cruiser I). Both the new Cruiser and the Mailplane were displayed at the first Society of British Aircraft Constructors (SBAC) Show at Hendon Aerodrome on 27 June 1932. It was then used for demonstrations, including a 3,593-mile European sales tour. The Yugoslavia airline Aeroput ordered two aircraft and a licence to build further examples in Yugoslavia at the Zmaj aircraft factory.Yugoslavia - The Aviation Industry at aeroflight.co.uk, Retrieved 4 December 2013 The Cruiser was re-designed as the Spartan Cruiser II, featuring a modified fuselage and cockpit. The first Cruiser II (G-ACBM) flew in February 1933, powered by Cirrus Hermes IV engines, and G-ACKG/VT-AERVT- is the prefix for Indian registered aircraft - in this case the aircraft was owned by His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala also used that engine type. Most Spartan-built Cruiser IIs were powered by three Gipsy Major engines, but G-ACOU/OK-ATM was powered by Walter Major engines. In 1933 and 1934, twelve Cruiser IIs were built by Spartan, five of which were exported. Just one licence-built Cruiser II (YU-SAP)Image of YU-SAP was built in Zemun, Yugoslavia, by Zmaj aircraft company, in 1935.Zmaj AircraftZmaj aircraft company One further development was the Spartan Cruiser III, with an aerodynamically-refined fuselage accommodating eight passengers, a modified windscreen and a trousered main undercarriage. Only three Cruiser IIIs were built (G-ACYK, G-ADEL and G-ADEM), for Spartan Air Lines. Operational history Spartan Air Lines Ltd was formed to operate Cruisers between London and Cowes, Isle of Wight. In April 1933, Spartan Air Lines initially operated the one Cruiser I (G-ABTY) and two Cruiser IIs (G-ACDW and G-ACDX) from Heston Aerodrome.

It started in 1854 with the first telegraph line in Egypt. In 1998, it replaced the former Arab Republic of Egypt National Telecommunication Organization (ARENTO). The company has a fixed-line subscriber base in excess of 6 million subscribers. Telecom Egypt acquired TE Data (formerly GegaNet) in late 2001 to act as its data communications and ISP arm. The company has another IT arm, Xceedcc - Xceed contact center - located in Egypt's Smart Village. Telecom Egypt also owns 44.95% of Vodafone Egypt. Telecom Egypt has adopted the contemporary quality integration trends and established the quality sector in 2001, which is now preparing the whole company to take the ISO 9001-2000 certificate. Its main operational offices are in Cairo, Al Mansurah, Ismailia, Alexandria, Suez and Tanta. On August 31, 2016, Telecom Egypt (TE) became a fully-fledged mobile operator after agreeing to pay E¬£7.08 billion (‚Ç¨713.14 million) for a 4G licence. On September 18, 2017, Telecom Egypt launched its mobile service, branded as WE. In Feb 2019, Telecom Egypt signed Memorandum of Understanding with its strategic partner Nokia for the development of 5G use cases in Egypt.http://ir.te.eg/en/CorporateNews/PressRelease/99/Telecom-Egypt-and- Nokia-sign-MoU-to-introduce-5G-network-and-test-use-cases= History =Origins= The government initiative that later became Telecom Egypt started as a telegraph line between the Governorate of Cairo and the Governorate of Alexandria in 1854 built by the British Eastern Telegraph Company. Egypt's first telephone line was installed between Cairo and Alexandria in 1881. In 1881, the Egyptian government purchased the Eastern Telephone Company and created the Telephone and Telegraph Authority. Under Law No. 107 of 1957, all assets of the Eastern Company and other telecommunications providers were transferred to the Ministry of Telecommunications. In the same year, Presidential Decree No. 709 placed all wire and wireless communications under the jurisdiction of the Wire and Wireless Communications Authority which reported to the Ministry of Transport. The Arab Republic of Egypt National Telecommunications Organization (ARENTO) was established in 1980 as an autonomous public utility reporting to the Ministry of Transport. Via Law No. 19 of 1998, ARENTO was renamed Telecom Egypt and turned into a joint stock company over which the government maintained full ownership. =Telecom liberalization and Telecom Egypt= Telecom Egypt replaced ARENTO in 1998 and the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology was founded in order to develop Egypt's information and communications technology infrastructure. In 2001, Telecom Egypt established TE Data, a data and communications subsidiary. In the same year, Telecom Egypt was awarded a license to begin mobile operations in Egypt but declined. Instead, TE purchased an 8.6% share in Vodafone Egypt in 2003. Telecom Egypt gradually increased their holdings in Vodafone Egypt until the end of 2008, when their share was 44.95%. Today, Vodafone Egypt represents a significant source of revenue for Telecom Egypt. In November 2005, the Egyptian government launched an IPO of 20% of Telecom Egypt's existing share capital. In 2006, the National Telecom Regulatory Authority (NTRA) deregulated Telecom Egypt's monopoly over domestic and international telephone service, and announced the potential for another fixed-line operator. This initiative was put on hold due to economic pressure, and Telecom Egypt is still Egypt's only fixed line operator. Due to the government's 80% share in the company, Telecom Egypt is beholden to the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) for all major decisions concerning finances, tariffs and employment. The MCIT is seen by some to exert control over the National Telecom Regulatory Authority, leading to potential conflicts of interest. In an interview published in May‚ÄìJune 2014, Telecom Egypt's CEO said that the company was awarded a unified telecoms licence in April 2014, but he said that this would lead to a change in the relationship with Vodafone Egypt, in which Telecom Egypt has a stake of just under 45%. Telecom Egypt will be able to offer mobile services under the terms of the new licence, he said, and will be using new 4G spectrum from 2015, and that would lead to a break-up of the relationship with Vodafone, by Telecom Egypt either buying the rest of the Vodafone Egypt stake or selling its stake to the Vodafone group. Products and services Telecom Egypt is Egypt's only fixed-line operator, and one of the largest in the MENA region with over 9 million subscribers as of 2009. The company offers services in two categories, retail and wholesale. On the retail side, Telecom Egypt offers access and voice services for home and enterprises and data services through TE Data. TE Data had a 61% market share in Egypt in 2009 and also operates in Jordan. TE Data offers additional services through a collaboration with the Microsoft Live platform. Telecom Egypt is Egypt's only supplier of wholesale services. The company leases broadband capacity as well as national and international interconnection services in both data and voice. Telecom Egypt also provides infrastructure and transport services, voice and data services, and hosting. Whole services accounted for 42% of revenues in 2009. Telecom Egypt also offers mobile services through its stake in Vodafone Egypt. Overall, Telecom Egypt has a public monopoly over fixed landlines, provides 70% of internet service in Egypt, is the only provider of international phone service, and provides connectivity to all mobile operators. Though Telecom Egypt has recently applied to be a virtual network operator of mobile services in Egypt, perceived market domination might prevent a direct entry into the mobile phone market. =Retail services= Telecom Egypt offers fixed-line voice services and mobile through their partnership with Vodafone Egypt. They offer broadband internet and IPTV services as well as \\"enterprise-managed internet access, managed network services, and outsourcing of information and communication technologies services\\". =Wholesale= Telecom Egypt offers wholesale services to domestic and international customers. Internationally, Telecom Egypt is becoming a telecommunications and data hub between Asia, Africa, and Western Europe. The TE North cable, built in collaboration with Alcatel-Lucent, is a 40G undersea cable that connects Abu Talat, Egypt, to Marseille, France, with branches to Jordan, Cyprus and branching units to be used for further expansion. It began operation in mid-2011.

Telecom Egypt, as one of the five major network providers in Egypt, and the owner of \\"virtually all the country's fiber-optic cables\\" was instrumental in the government's shutdown. The government also used its hold over Telecom Egypt's infrastructure to leverage providers like Vodafone Egypt into shutting down their services. If these companies did not shut down independently, the reversal of the government's method of blocking their services would've taken more time to reverse. In April 2011, a lawsuit was brought to the High Administrative Court seeking damages from three telecommunications companies (including Telecom Egypt) as well as current and former officials. The verdict eventually reached, which held accountable officials but not companies, stated that the internet shutdown had been practiced as early as April 2008, during the Mahalla Al Kobra protests in conjunction with telecom companies and ISPs in Egypt, and again in October 2010. In addition to the shutdown, mobile operators' networks, including Vodafone Egypt's, were hijacked by the Egyptian government in order to send text messages directly to customers. =2011 sit In= On October 12, 2011, five Telecom Egypt employees were detained by police and charged with attempted murder of the company's CEO Mohamed Abdel Rahim. According to protestors, the CEO visited the offices and employees gathered at his office to present demands associated with working conditions at Telecom Egypt. After he refused to hear their demands, they staged a sit-in in front of his office, which eventually ended when military police cut into his office from an adjacent room. Protestors organized a protest and strike calling for the release of their co-workers. Telephone directory services and the Telecom Egypt service hotline were shut down in protest as well. The protestors claimed that Abdel Rahim and the board of directors were responsible for corruption and called for their resignation as well as the revision of high officials' salaries. On October 23, 2011, the head of the independent workers union of Telecom Egypt, Mohamed Abu Karish, said that the prisoners would be released and disputed claims that workers threatened to shut down internet and communication services as an attempt to undermine the protest. Abdel Rahim withdrew his murder accusation and the detainees were set free on October 25.

The drug gangs sponsored DJs and baile funks in the favelas they controlled to spread respect and love for their gang as well as hate to the other gangs. The music that resulted is proibid√£o.

Other gangs also have renowned songs. For example, the gang Amigos dos Amigos (Portuguese for ‚Äò‚ÄôFriends of Friends‚Äô‚Äô) is known for \\"A.D.A do Chuck\\", featuring MC Cruel.

Proibid√£o has some very important implications for the acquisition of social space in Rio. For the gangs and drug lords, it represents a form of musical expression that corresponds to territorial dominance. In effect, when these gangs host their particular bailes, they assert their authority over rival gangs and state law enforcement. Since Proibid√£o elicits the criminal lifestyle and habitual drug use which characterize its performers, police naturally attempt to stop the bailes and the correlative spread of Proibid√£o.Cumming, Andy. \\"Who Let the Yobs Out?\\" Stylus Magazine, 21 November 2005.

In addition to just hosting these bailes, the gangs recruit urban youth and advertise their daily struggle, which makes the favela bailes a crucial social space in which gangs can conduct business.

He wrote by the name H.A. de Lacy. de Lacy was the chief football writer for The Sporting Globe newspaper in Melbourne. He was noted for the controversial and bold nature of his writings. He was often banned by clubs for periods of time. His opinionated and unabashed style made him one of the most widely read sports journalists of his time. He campaigned in the 1940s for better payments to players, arguing that 3 pounds per week was inadequate for the time spent training, travelling and injuries. He was an ardent supporter of the Victorian Football Association's throw-pass rules, which were in effect in that league during the 1940s. deLacy also wrote about tennis and cricket. de Lacy was inducted to the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, with his citation reading: :Chief football writer on The Sporting Globe. Forthright and controversial, his style sometimes resulted in him being banned by clubs, but that did not deter him and he became one of the most widely read journalists from the 1940s.

Tchaikovsky dedicated the work to the St. Petersburg Chamber Music Society in response to his becoming an Honorary Member. The work, in the traditional four-movement form, was titled \\"Souvenir de Florence\\" because the composer sketched one of the work's principal themes while visiting Florence, Italy, where he composed The Queen of Spades. The work was revised between December 1891 and January 1892, before being premiered in 1892.  Structure  *I. Allegro con spirito (D minor, approx. 10:00) *II. Adagio cantabile e con moto (D major, approx. 11:00) *III. Allegretto moderato (A minor, approx. 6:00) *IV. Allegro con brio e vivace (D minor - D major, approx. 7:00)  Analysis  The first movement is in sonata form and, without introduction, presents a rather violent yet melodic first theme in D minor. The second theme, in the dominant major key of A major, is much calmer; it flows from the first theme almost effortlessly and then proceeds into the development and recapitulation, which concludes with a quick coda. The slow movement, in D major, has a very innocent, romantic theme initially stated by the first violin with pizzicato accompaniment before being taken up by the cello. Following interruption by an interlude for all of the instruments, the theme returns for a repeat of the first section. The last two movements, with their distinctly Russian and folk-like melodies and rhythms, greatly contrast with the previous ones. Arrangements This work has also been arranged for string orchestra. Excerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet Anna Karenina, choreographed by Boris Eifman.

Graham was named for William Alexander Graham, a 19th-century governor of North Carolina and a U.S. Secretary of the Navy. Constructed in eight weeks, the 441-foot steamship was operated by J.H.

The ship had a second close encounter with the enemy in June 1944, when German bombers attacked the harbor at Anzio where William A. Graham lay at anchor with six other merchantmen. A record of William A. Grahams maiden voyage is preserved in the diary of the ship‚Äôs first assistant engineer, Everett S. Ransom. Copies of the diary have been donated to nearly 30 libraries and museums around the United States, including the Lower Cape Fear Historical Society, the North Carolina Collection at UNC-Chapel Hill, and the Nimitz Library of the United States Naval Academy.

History The alley is named after Staffan Sasse, a man originating from Westphalia in Germany, who bought a house bel√¶get paa k√∏pmana gatwne (\\"situated on K√∂pmangatan\\" (Merchant's Street)) in 1524, and the alley was associated with his name from 1569. He served, first under Sten Sture the Younger (1493‚Äì1520), and then under King Gustav Vasa (1496‚Äì1560) during the ousting of the Danish forces. Staffan Sasse was raised to peerage in 1524 and appointed court bailiff in 1531. The alley was called 'gamble (\\"old\\") Staffan Saxsses gr√§ndh' in 1615, but is referred to as the alley of Blasius Dundie in 1609. Dundie was a merchant from Scotland who is said to have owned a garden in the alley, at the time facing his building on the opposite side of K√∂pmangatan. His presence in Stockholm is first documented in 1576, and his business was apparently successful, since he owned a great number of properties in and around the city and is one of the renowned Blasius potentially having given his name to Blasieholmen, today a peninsula in central Stockholm but at the time an islet east of the city. By the end of the 17th century, the alley was referred to as Jgnatij grendh after the printer Ignatius Meurer (1589‚Äì1672), a German who settled in Stockholm in 1610, arguably because his famous printing workshop was located in the alley (see also Ignatiigr√§nd).

Prior to 1970, portions of CR 33 were designated as the old route of New York State Route 304\\\\. Today, CR 33 serves as an alternative route for NY 304 from Pearl River to New City where NY 304 ends at US 9W. North of New City, CR 33 serves as an alternative route for the US 9W/US 202 multiplex in northern Rockland County. CR 33 is the longest county route in Rockland, and in fact is longer than all NY state routes within the county except for NY 59 (only shorter by three-quarters of a mile). CR 33 intersects several major west‚Äìeast roads within the county. It even intersects the Palisades Interstate Parkway at exit 10 in New City. CR 33 has one present child-route in CR 33A in Nanuet, and until recently had three with CR 33B located in New City and CR 33C located in Stony Point. Route description CR 33 begins here at NY 304, and proceeds east through Pearl River before turning north on Middletown Road. CR 33 begins at NY 304 in Pearl River, and ends at CR 106 (Old NY 210) in Stony Point. CR 33 runs through Pearl River, Nanuet, New City, Garnerville, and Stony Point. CR 33 is an alternate route for NY 304 from Pearl River to New City, and an alternate route for US 9W/US 202 from Garnerville to Stony Point. Between New City and Garnerville, CR 33 goes up Hi-Tor Mountain through Hi-Tor State Park. Unlike most the county routes in Rockland, CR 33 runs through many business areas. It cuts through downtown Garnerville, Nanuet, and Pearl River. In fact, CR 33 is a primary access road for The Shops at Nanuet. Only in New City does CR 33 serve really as a residential road. CR 33 begins here at CR 106 in Stony Point. CR 33 begins at NY 304 in Pearl River just a half a mile north of the New Jersey border. For the first , CR 33 runs in a west‚Äìeast direction through downtown Pearl River (Central Avenue) When CR 33 reaches Middletown Road, it turns north through the northern portions of Pearl River. CR 33 serves as the primary road throughout business areas of Pearl River. CR 33 then intersects NY 304 for the second time in Pearl River and heads north into Nanuet. Like in Pearl River, CR 33 splits downtown Nanuet with intersections with CR 42, CR 46, and its child-route, CR 33A. Here CR 33 is still named Middletown Road, but it is also considered Main Street within the business district of Nanuet. As CR 33 leaves downtown Nanuet, it has a rather busy intersection with NY 59. This is because The Shops at Nanuet and the Rockland Plaza strip mall are located at this intersection. After this intersection, CR 33 proceeds north into residential areas of Nanuet running parallel to NY 304\\\\. Here it meets CR 60 at Smith Road. CR 33 here in New City as it proceeds north toward Hi-Tor Mountain. As CR 33 enters New City it has its intersection with the Palisades Interstate Parkway at exit 10\\\\. This intersection is rather large as it also includes Germonds Road and West Clarkstown Road, which are major roads in New City. As CR 33 crosses the PIP, it changes from Middletown Road into Little Tor Road. It then proceeds north into residential New City with intersections with CR 76 and CR 80. Its intersection with CR 80 marks the intersection with the two longest county routes in Rockland. CR 33 continues north through New City for another before beginning its trek through Hi-Tor State Park. CR 33 spends two miles (3 km) climbing and descending Hi-Tor Mountain. At its summit, drivers going southbound can see into New York City on a clear day. As CR 33 leaves Hi-Tor Park it enters the village of Garnerville. Here, CR 33 intersects and joins US 202 for a third of a mile before turning north. It crosses CR 94 in downtown Garnerville. In fact, this used to be the former eastern terminus of CR 94, until it was extended beyond US 9W/US 202 in West Haverstraw. CR 33 then proceeds into the town of Stony Point for the final mile and a half of its run. It intersects CR 98 and CR 100 before coming to an end at CR 106. It really would be impossible to extend CR 33 further north as Bear Mountain State Park lies close to its northern terminus. History Prior to 1970, portions of CR 33 were designated as the old route of NY 304. Also, the section between CR 94 and CR 106, known locally as Central Highway, was once the rail bed of the New Jersey & New York Railroad Line spur ending at Stony Point Station.

The film has Arjun and Sonali Bendre in the lead roles, while Suchindra, Ruchita, Manivannan, Crazy Mohan, Anu Mohan, Kovai Sarala and Nizhalgal Ravi portray supporting roles. Music was composed by Deva. The film was released in August 1999. The film was dubbed in Telugu as Prema Gharshana. The film's name is based on a song from Jeans (1998). Plot Seetharam (Arjun) is a well-respected businessman who lives with his PA Muthuswamy (Anu Mohan) in Chennai. Although being a short-tempered and tense person, Seetharam is good at heart and helps people in need. He soon meets and falls in love with Kalyani (Sonali Bendre). After a couple of meetings she sees his good nature and falls in love with him. But, Seetharam faces problems in the form of another loving couple, Akash (Suchindra) and Akhila (Ruchita) due to an argument between Akhila and Akash and Akhila acts as Seetharam's fianc√© so that she can get rid of Akash just before he proposes to Kalyani. Kalyani, being an innocent, believes her words and goes away from Seetharam. Hence, Seetharam becomes the main antagonist of the film to make the lives of Akash and Akhila miserable. An enraged and betrayed Seetharam therefore seeks revenge against Akash and Akhila by separating them. But, he fails in all of his attempts. He also attempts to stop the love marriage between Akash and Akhila, which is arranged by Madana Gopal (Manivannan), Akash's father. But, when Akash and Akhila meet and ask apologies to him, but Seetharam does not forgive them and sends goons to kill them. To his horror and sad shock, Seetharam meets Kalyani with her blind brother (Nizhalgal Ravi). She tells him that Akash and Akhila met her and apologized for their behaviour, but she learnt the good heart of Seetharam after her marriage. Seetharam also informs this matter to Akash and Akhila, and saves them from the henchmen who have not seen Seetharam and don't know that he was the one who hired them to murder. Seetharam bids goodbye to both of them. Hence, the movie ends with the moral that \\"Too much of anything is good for nothing.\\" =Alternate Climax= After sending goons to kill both Akash and Akhila, Seetharam had a change in mind and decides to forgive and save them from the henchmen. A fight ensures when Seetharam asked the henchmen to leave both them for which they refuse, since they didn't know that he was the one who hired them to murder Akash and Akhila. After the fight with the henchmen Seetharam explains them what made him to change his mind. When Seetharam was on his way to the place where Akash and Akhila were taken by the henchmen, unexpectedly as a sweet surprise he meets Kalyani at the airport with her blind brother (Nizhalgal Ravi). She tells him that Akash and Akhila met her and apologized for their behaviour and she learnt the good heart of Seetharam. Kalyani's brother requests Seetharam to accept his sister to which Seetharam happily accepts. Finally the movie ends with Seetharam and Kalyani uniting.

Prabhu Solomon chose to feature Raghuvaran and Bhanupriya in the leading roles, though the producers Anabalaya Films were reluctant to cast a character artiste in the lead role. Prabhu revealed he met Arjun in Thenkasi during the making of Mudhalvan (1999), at the insistence of his producer and actively tried to make a poor impression. Arjun, nonetheless, was keen and worked on the film.

It was located at U.S. Route 40 and Interstate 695, and was at its peak when it opened in 1974. The grand opening, a resplendent affair, was set amid the fine artwork and spacious courtyards at the mall. The grand opening was created by George Reavis \\"Buck\\" Sappenfield III, a native of Sherman, Texas, who brought the \\"bigger than Texas\\" celebration to East Baltimore. The mall included a center court filled with palm trees and fountains, as well as sculptures by Rita Blitt and Bogdan Grom. Sappenfield had created programs of similar largesse at Mounds Mall in Anderson, Indiana and Irving Mall in Irving, Texas. It would later face competition from White Marsh Mall, and Eastpoint Mall. It has now been revitalized, and is known as The Centre at Golden Ring. History The mall had three anchors: Hecht's (known as The Hecht Company at the time), Montgomery Ward, and Stewart's (a local Baltimore area department store). When Stewart's closed its doors in the early 1980s, Caldor took over the lease space. Golden Ring's demise began in the late 1980s, and was all but closed in 1990 when Hutzler's at White Marsh Mall closed. Hecht's opened a new location in White Marsh's former Hutzler's space in 1992. The Hecht's and Montgomery Ward stayed open until the mall closed. Caldor closed in the late 1990s, and Simon closed the mall in early 2001. In early 2002, Simon Properties sold the failing mall to Petrie Ventures, Inc. and Heritage Development Co. of Chagrin Falls, Ohio for $14 million. The Movies at Golden Ring Another major tenant at Golden Ring was a multiplex cinema operated by United Artists Theatres. At first, there were five screens: three on the upper level near Montgomery Ward (opening in 1976), and two on the upper level near Hecht's (1977). In late 1985, four additional screens opened on the lower level next to Hecht's. In 1992-94, the theatre received a major technical and aesthetic upgrade, and three new screens were opened below the original three, for a total of twelve. There also was a \\"Starport\\" interactive arcade. Finally, the theatre was well-known for its presentation of the cult film \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" (1981-82; 1985-92). Once one of UA's most profitable complexes, its fortunes declined along with those of the mall, especially after the 1997 opening of a 16-screen stadium-seating complex at White Marsh (originally operated by Sony Theatres, now run by AMC Theatres). The Centre at Golden Ring The new owners brought about the successful revitalization of the mall, which has daily traffic estimated at 150,000 cars. In 2002, the two-level Golden Ring mall was demolished and the space reconfigured. The site is now occupied by an open-air shopping center called \\"The Centre at Golden Ring\\".Southeast Snapshot, Baltimore Retail Market, Thomas Fidler Jr., Southeast Real Estate Business, December 2004 Retail space has been downsized from to .

Controversy arose in the CIA over whether he was a bona fide defector and he was held in detention for over three years before he was finally accepted as a legitimate defector by the CIA. After his release, he became an American citizen, working as a consultant for the CIA. Biography Nosenko was born in Nikolaev, Ukrainian SSR (now Mykolaiv, Ukraine). His father, Ivan Nosenko, was USSR Minister of Shipbuilding from 1939 until his death in 1956. During WWII, Nosenko attended naval preparatory school, intending on a career in shipbuilding, like his father. After the war, he attended the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO), graduating in 1950. On graduation he served in Naval Intelligence until he transferred to the KGB in 1953. In the KGB, he worked primarily in the Second Chief Directorate, which was responsible for internal security. Defection Nosenko contacted the CIA in Geneva, when he accompanied a diplomatic mission to that city in 1962. Nosenko offered his services for a small amount of money, claiming that a prostitute had robbed him of $900 worth of Swiss francs. He claimed to be deputy chief of the Seventh Department of the KGB, and provided some information that would only be known by someone connected to the KGB. He was given the money he requested and told $25,000 a year would be deposited in an account in his name in the West. Then, at a meeting set up in 1964 he unexpectedly claimed that he had been discovered by the KGB and needed to defect immediately. Nosenko claimed that the Geneva KGB residency had received a cable recalling him to Moscow and he was fearful that he had been found out. NSA was later, but not at the time, able to determine that no such cable had been sent, and Nosenko subsequently admitted making this up to persuade the CIA to accept his defection, which the CIA did. Assertions about the Kennedy assassination Nosenko claimed that he could provide important negative information about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, affirming that he had personally handled a review of the case of Lee Harvey Oswald, who had lived in the Soviet Union in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Nosenko said that, while the KGB had conducted surveillance of Oswald, it had never tried to recruit him. This issue was critical because KGB involvement with Oswald might suggest Soviet involvement in the Kennedy assassination ‚Äì a prospect that could have propelled the Cold War into a nuclear war. Nosenko insisted that after interviewing Oswald it was decided that Oswald was not intelligent enough and also \\"too mentally unstable,\\" a \\"nut\\" and therefore unsuitable for intelligence work. Nosenko also stated that the KGB had never questioned Oswald about information he might have gained as a U.S. Marine, including work as an aviation electronics operator at Naval Air Facility Atsugi in Japan. Concerns that Nosenko was a double agent The CIA's Soviet Union division suspected that Nosenko was a KGB plant. One reason was that although he finally admitted that he was only a captain instead of a lieutenant colonel (claiming he had exaggerated his rank to make himself attractive to the CIA), the official KGB documents he had initially provided were examined by the CIA and proved that Nosenko was indeed a lieutenant colonel. A second reason was that an earlier KGB defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn, had predicted that the KGB would send someone after him to try to discredit him. Many inside the CIA thought Nosenko fit this picture, partly because one of Golytsin's main claims was that the KGB had a mole deep in the CIA and Nosenko claimed there was not. Nosenko was seized by CIA officers in Washington and from 1964 to 1967 was subjected to increasingly harsh and hostile interrogation methods, including being held in solitary confinement in a CIA safe house in Clinton, Maryland, in an operation approved by CIA Director John A. McCone.https://www.cia.gov/open/Family%20Jewels.pdf The situation was made more complex by another alleged defector controlled by the FBI, codenamed Fedora, a KGB agent who posed as a Soviet diplomat to infiltrate the United Nations and provide false information to the Americans. Fedora was later revealed to be a KGB colonel named Victor Mechislavich Lesovski. Fedora confirmed Nosenko's story about Oswald and that he was indeed a KGB colonel and genuine mole. At that point, the Nosenko issue evolved into an interservice confrontation. To the CIA, Nosenko was not a genuine KGB mole because he was found to have lied about his grade and his recall orders to the USSR. But the FBI accepted him as genuine, as agreeing that Nosenko was a KGB plant would consequently compromise the credibility of Fedora, the only Soviet source corroborating Nosenko's story. Two lie detector tests conducted by the CIA suggested that Nosenko was lying. Nosenko claimed that the results of the first polygraph were prearranged in a way to break him, while prior to the second polygraph, he was examined by a doctor who \\"inserted a gloved finger inside Nosenko's rectum and, over his protests, wriggled it around for some ten minutes. The doctor suggested he liked the \\"degradation.\\" Nosenko said that this was done to anger him and stimulate his blood pressure, a key factor in affecting polygraph readings.\\" Moreover, Nosenko confessed that he had lied to the CIA about his military rank. However, Nosenko passed a third polygraph test given in August 1968, which also included questions about Oswald. Part of the evidence against Nosenko was from the work of defected KGB Major and CIA agent Peter Deriabin. Deriabin had worked in the same parts of the Soviet KGB where Nosenko had claimed to have worked, but found the details of Nosenko's stories (which changed over time) to be unconvincing. Years after the incident, Deriabin still believed Nosenko was a KGB plant. Peter Deriabin noticed inconsistencies and factual errors in Nosenko's accounts: *Nosenko \\"could not describe in detail how such a [KGB file] check is done...\\" *Nosenko, having ostensibly served as a security officer for delegations, \\"could not even explain how Soviet citizens are checked... before going abroad.\\" *Nosenko \\"knew so little about day-to-day procedures... that one can only conclude that he had never been a KGB officer, at least not in Moscow...\\" When the interrogations led to no substantial results the interrogators were changed, and after a new team was brought on, Nosenko was cleared of all suspicions and released with pay. The question of whether Nosenko was a KGB plant is controversial, and those who handled him initially still believe that his unsolicited walk-in was designed by the KGB to protect a Soviet mole threatened by Golitsyn's knowledge, and his defection by a Soviet desire to discredit the idea of a connection between the Soviet Union and the actions of Lee Harvey Oswald. Others have argued Nosenko was ultimately regarded as an authentic defector through misinformation from another KGB-agent that was thought to be a genuine defector, code-named Fedora. Fedora corroborated Nosenko's authenticity and allegations, specifically that he was indeed a Lt. Colonel of the KGB and that he indeed received recalling orders just before fleeing to the USA.Ashley, C., 2004,CIA spymaster, Gretna, LA: Pelican, p. 279 Nosenko confessed later after failing to pass successive poly examinations that he was in reality a KGB captain, while, after NSA revealed that no recall orders ever reached Geneva Soviet embassy, he confessed that he also lied about that.Ashley, C., 2004,CIA spymaster, Gretna, LA: Pelican, p. 282 Since Fedora was surely a Soviet agent and he tried to corroborate Nosenko's counterfeited story, it became obvious that Nosenko was a double agent. In the same way, from the time when Nosenko confessed that he lied about his grade and the recall orders, it became obvious that Fedora was also a double agent working for the Soviets. Despite these and other indications, both CIA and FBI administrations choose for a number of reasons to ignore the obvious in either cases. Nosenko has later claimed to have been tortured and even at one point, he said during interrogation, he was given LSD, and it almost killed him. The guards revived him by dragging him into the shower and alternating the water between hot and cold. These claims have been denied by Richard Helms who was Director of Central Intelligence during the most intense part of Nosenko's interrogation. Golitsyn's defection led the KGB to notify fifty-four Rezidentura to temporarily suspend all meetings with important agents.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin (1999). The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB. Basic Books. . The KGB also made significant efforts to discredit Golitsyn by promoting disinformation that he was involved in illegal smuggling operations. After five years, in 1967, KGB assassination and sabotage section under Viktor Vladimirov finally discovered Golitsyn's CIA hideout in Canada and attempted unsuccessfully to assassinate him. Nosenko's case officer was Tennent H. \\"Pete\\" Bagley, both when they first met in Geneva in 1962 and subsequently when he defected in 1964. Bagley, subsequently chief of counterintelligence for the Soviet Russia (\\"SR\\") Division and Division Deputy Director, wrote a book that was substantially about the Nosenko case. In response to Bagley's book, other members of the intelligence community have re-examined the Nosenko case and repeated Bagley's concerns. CIA operations officer George Kisevalter, well regarded for his prior handling of Major Pyotr Popov, the first Soviet GRU officer run by the CIA, and a native Russian speaker, was detailed to assist Bagley. In 2013 Bagley wrote another book, revealing new details he acquired by comparing notes with Soviet KGB Chief Sergey Kondrashev.Spymaster, Tennent H. Bagley, Skyhorse Publishing, New York, Delaware, 2013 Bagley says he had always suspected that Nosenko might be a plant and was glad to have this confirmed by Kondrashev. Both Bagley and Kondrashev expressed surprise that CIA had accepted Nosenko as genuine for as long as they had, despite more than 30 warning signs. Aftermath On March 1, 1969, Nosenko was formally acknowledged to be a genuine defector, and released, with $80,000 worth of financial compensation from the CIA. He was also provided with a new identity to live out his life in the South of the US. The harsh treatment he received as part of the early US interrogation was one of the \\"abuses\\" documented in the Central Intelligence Agency \\"Family Jewels\\" documents in 1973. In an internal note at the CIA in 1978, then DCI Stansfield Turner, referring to Nosenko's solitary confinement, stated: The case has been examined in several books, and the 1986 movie Yuri Nosenko: Double Agent starring Tommy Lee Jones. The movie depicted the intense debate over whether Nosenko was an actual defector. He exposed John Vassall, a British civil servant already revealed as a KGB agent by Golitsyn and eventually charged for spying in 1962, and Robert Lee Johnson, a U.S. Marine in Berlin arrested in 1964. Nosenko lived in the US under an assumed name until his death.Express (Washington Post), August 28, 2008, p.6 17 audio files of interviews of Nosenko during the investigation of the Kennedy assassination were made public by the National Archives on July 24, 2017.

It is also a civil parish and an ecclesiastical parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe. The area was officially classified as part of the West Clare Gaeltacht; an Irish-speaking community; until 1956. St MIchael's Shrine and Holy Well in Main Street, Kilmihil, Co Clare History It is believed that St. Michael‚Äôs Church was founded by St. Senan around 530AD. He dedicated this church to St. Michael. For centuries it became a place of pilgrimage to St. Michael, especially in September, as his feast day is on September 29. In 1937, the Curate of the parish, Fr. Patrick O‚ÄôReilly, organised the improvement of the well, and the surrounding area. The well is now enclosed, and over this building is the Statue of St. Michael, enclosed in glass. Tradition credits the founding of a church here to St. Senan, in honour of Michael the Archangel. During the reign of Pope Gelasius I, (AD 492-496), an apparition of the Archangel was reported to have taken place on the summit of Mt. Garganus, in Apulia, in Italy. This apparition report, and the founding of the church in Kilmihil, both took place during St. Senan‚Äôs lifetime (488 ‚Äì 554 AD). After visiting Rome about 530 AD, he returned to Ireland, wishing to foster devotion to Michael. While travelling from Scattery Island to Doolough, he stopped in Kilmihil, where he founded the church. Amenities The village has two grocery stores, a pharmacy, four pubs, a post office, and butcher's shop. Other amenities are the credit union, library, garage, creche, retirement village, church, and a community centre. There is a primary school and a secondary school (St. Michaels Community College) in the village and a further primary school in the townland of Cahermurphy. Sport Kilmihil GAA club won the Clare Senior Football Championship in 1980, its sole victory in the championship's history. Kilmihil's soccer club is named St. Pat's.

Education An American citizen born in Vigo, Spain, Perez studied electronic engineering, marketing, and business in Spain and France, graduating from the Technical University of Madrid (Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid). He subsequently earned an MBA at INSEAD. In 2009, he received an honorary doctorate degree from the University of Rochester. Pre-Kodak years Prior to joining Eastman Kodak, Antonio P√©rez spent 25 years working at Hewlett Packard; at the end of this time he was corporate vice president and a member of the company's executive council. In his career, Perez has held a variety of positions in research and development, sales, manufacturing, marketing and management both in Europe and the United States. Immediately prior to joining Kodak, Perez served as an independent consultant for large investment firms, providing counsel on the effect of technology shifts on financial markets. From June 2000 to December 2001, Perez was president and chief executive officer of Gemplus International. Perez served as a director of Schering-Plough Corporation from 2007 through November 2009 and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. from 2004 to 2007. Stint at Eastman Kodak P√©rez was named president of Kodak on April 2, 2003. On May 19, 2005 P√©rez was named CEO of Kodak after the retirement of Daniel Carp. On January 1, 2006, he became chairman of the company's board of directors. Under Perez, who joined Kodak from Hewlett-Packard in 2003 and became chief executive in 2005, the company has tried to reinvent itself by focusing on printers, packaging and work force software, however, under P√©rez's leadership the price of Kodak shares has decreased from around 25 dollars (in 2005) to less than 1 dollar by September 30, 2011 and the number of Kodak employees has been reduced to about 7000 in the Rochester, NY area where Kodak is headquartered.Democrat and Chronicle, July 1, 2010 P√©rez was named one of the worst CEOs of 2011 by several online financial news source and online publications including CNBC and the Motley Fool. Perez financed those efforts with billions in licensing fees from Kodak's intellectual property, but analysts warned that Kodak was burning through cash too quickly and could eventually run out. Kodak bankruptcy On January 19, 2012 Kodak officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, under which the company had until February, 2013 to provide an acceptable restructuring plan. In a video message, Antonio P√©rez was quoted as saying, ‚ÄúWhat everyone should expect from Kodak is business as usual.‚Äù Many business critics point out that \\"business as usual\\" is the problem with the Kodak Business model. They questioned how Kodak would emerge from bankruptcy as a viable company since it has not yet proved that its turnaround strategy, focusing on consumer and commercial printers, can turn a profit. Shannon Cross, an analyst who has had a sell rating on Kodak since 2001, said the problem for Kodak was that its core businesses had not been making money and the company had been living off licensing fees for intellectual property.‚ÄúTo me it‚Äôs not clear that the pieces that will be left at the end make sense as a stand-alone company,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad that it happened. It‚Äôs not a surprise, the way it‚Äôs been managed.‚Äù In explaining the bankruptcy, Perez said his turnaround efforts were hurt by the recession, which slowed new business growth and expedited the decline of the film business. He said the objectives of the reorganization included obtaining new financing to shore up confidence in Kodak, selling some of the company's patents and adjusting ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù costs ‚Äì like health care benefits for retirees ‚Äì to the company's now smaller size. ‚ÄúKodak is taking a significant step toward enabling our enterprise to complete its transformation,‚Äù he said in prepared remarks. Under the leadership of P√©rez, Eastman Kodak Co. announced on February 9, 2012 that it will stop making digital cameras, pocket video cameras and digital picture frames in a move that will mark the end of an era for the 132-year-old company. Awards, recognitions, and controversy P√©rez received the 2008 Corporate Distinguished Achievement Award from the B‚Äônai B‚Äôrith International for his humanitarian works and services. In 2009, P√©rez received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Rochester during the presidency of Joel Seligman. Also, in 2009, Antonio P√©rez was named one of the Top 10 CEO's \\"To Go\\", according to 247wallst.com. Criticized for being one of the worst CEO's in the nation, citing the decline of Eastman Kodak during his stint as CEO. In February 2011, Perez was appointed to President Obama's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. He is also a founding board member of Change the Equation, a CEO-led initiative to move the U.S. to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade.

Other terms are used for smaller areas of activity, such as volcanic fields. Volcanic belts are found above zones of unusually high temperature (700-1400 ¬∞C) where magma is created by partial melting of solid material in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. These areas usually form along tectonic plate boundaries at depths of 10‚Äì50 km. For example, volcanoes in Mexico and western North America are mostly in volcanic belts, such as the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern Mexico and the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province in western Canada. The deeply deformed and eroded remnants of ancient volcanic belts are found in volcanically inactive regions such as the Canadian Shield. It contains over 150 volcanic belts (now deformed and eroded down to nearly flat plains) that range from 600 to 1200 million years old. These are zones of variably metamorphosed mafic to ultramafic volcanic sequences with associated sedimentary rocks that form what are known as greenstone belts. They are thought to have formed at ancient oceanic spreading centers and island arc terranes. The Abitibi greenstone belt in Ontario and Quebec, Canada is one of the world's largest greenstone belts. Volcanic belts are similar to a mountain range, but the mountains within the mountain range are volcanoes, not mountains that are formed by faulting and folding by the collision of tectonic plates.Volcano World - What is a volcano belt?

They may be formed by subduction zones, which is an area on Earth where two tectonic plates meet and move towards one another, with one sliding underneath the other and moving down into the mantle, at rates typically measured in centimeters per year. An oceanic plate ordinarily slides underneath a continental plate; this often creates an orogenic zone with many volcanoes and earthquakes. In a sense, subduction zones are the opposite of divergent boundaries, areas where material rises up from the mantle and plates are moving apart. An example of a subduction-zone related volcanic belt is the Okhotsk-Chukotka Volcanic Belt in northeastern Eurasia, which is one of the largest subduction-zone related volcanic provinces in the world, stretching some 3200 km and comprising about 2 million km3 of volcanic and plutonic material. The Anahim Volcanic Belt in British Columbia, Canada Volcanic belts may also be formed by hotspots, which is a location on the Earth's surface that has experienced active volcanism for a long period of time. These volcanic belts are called volcanic chains. Canadian geologist John Tuzo Wilson came up with the idea in 1963 that volcanic chains like the Hawaiian Islands result from the slow movement of a tectonic plate across a \\"fixed\\" hot spot deep beneath the surface of the planet, thought to be caused by a narrow stream of hot mantle convecting up from the mantle-core boundary called a mantle plume. But more recently some geologists, such as Gillian Foulger view upper-mantle convection as a cause. This in turn has re-raised the antipodal pair impact hypothesis, the idea that pairs of opposite hot spots may result from the impact of a large meteor. Geologists have identified some 40-50 such hotspots around the globe, with Hawaii, R√©union, Yellowstone, Gal√°pagos, and Iceland overlying the most currently active. An example of a hotspot volcanic belt is the Anahim Volcanic Belt in British Columbia, Canada, which was formed as a result of the North American Plate sliding westward over the Anahim hotspot.Volcanoes of Canada - Map of Canadian volcanoes Retrieved on 2007-07-08 Most hotspot volcanoes are basaltic because they erupt through oceanic lithosphere (e.g., Hawaii, Tahiti). As a result, they are less explosive than subduction zone volcanoes, which have high water contents. Where hotspots occur under continental crust, basaltic magma is trapped in the less dense continental crust, which is heated and melts to form rhyolites. These rhyolites can be quite hot and form violent eruptions, despite their low water content. For example, the Yellowstone Caldera was formed by some of the most powerful volcanic explosions in geologic history.

Early career  Portrait of Catharina van Braam Houckgeest by unknown artist In 1757, van Braam joined the Dutch Navy as a midshipman, but soon left the navy for China in order to work for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). In 1758, van Braam arrived in China, and for the remaining eight years he was engage in trade in Guangzhou and Macau. During his sojourn in China, he left for Europe twice and married Catharina Cornelia Geertruida van Reede van Oudthoorn on his last visit. In 1773, van Braam left China and the following year, he settled in a county-seat near Zutphen in the province of Gelderland. Inspired by the American Revolution, he decided to immigrate to the United States and settled in Charleston to work as a merchant and rice planter in 1783. He became a US citizen the following year. As a consequence of a family tragedy, van Braam decided to leave the US and take up a position as chief of the Dutch factory in Guangzhou. After a long journey, with stops in the Netherlands, Malacca and Batavia, he arrived in Guangzhou in 1790.  Embassy to China  Having learned about the British Macartney Embassy to the Qing court in 1793, he requested that the commissioners-general in Batavia send a VOC embassy to the court of the Qianlong Emperor for the celebration of his sixtieth year on the throne. Batavia accepted the suggestion, but appointed the chief of the Dutch trading mission in Dejima, Isaac Titsingh (1745‚Äì1812) as head of the Dutch embassy instead of van Braam.van Braam Houckgeest, Andreas Everardus.

Van Braam's account of the Titsingh mission was initially written in French and published in Philadelphia. This is the title page from the second printing in 1798. In Beijing, the embassy was received together with representatives of other tributary countries and the members of the embassy performed the kowtow in front of the emperor according to Chinese custom.

Later life  Upon the embassy's return to Guangzhou in March 1795, van Braam was unable to find a ship bound for the Netherlands and chose to board a ship to Philadelphia, where he arrived in 1796. Van Braam's arrival in the city attracted a lot of attention and he published an account of his journey, which he dedicated to George Washington. Van Braam decided to stay in the area and settled in Bristol outside the city. In 1798, he decided to leave the United States for unknown reasons, and after short stays in Germany and England, he bought a small property in Amsterdam, where he died in July 1801.

Its applications are mostly found in network-oriented industries (like telecommunication, mail and energy) and often concerns the last mile. Unbundled access is similar to Bitstream access, where the incumbent provider gives competitive access not to the actual copper wire of the local loop, but to a high-speed ADSL data connection. Both setups ensure competition for the backhaul but leave \\"last mile\\" infrastructure the responsibility of the incumbent carrier. Telecommunications =United States= In the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 added a number of provisions designed to increase competition. Incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC), under this law, are required to interconnect with competing telecommunications carriers, allowing access to individual elements of the ILEC's own network on an unbundled basis. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provided three ways for companies to enter the new competitive telecommunications market: facilities systems, unbundled access, and resale networks. Unbundled access is defined as \\"The duty to provide, to any requesting telecommunications carrier for the provision of a telecommunications service, nondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis at any technically feasible point on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252. An incumbent local exchange carrier shall provide such unbundled network elements in a manner that allows requesting carriers to combine such elements in order to provide such telecommunications service. In 2005, after much litigation concerning its original unbundling rules, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made the decision to limit the number and types of unbundled elements that telecommunications carriers were required to offer competitors under the common carrier laws outlined in 47 U.S.C ¬ß¬ß 251.United States Telecom Ass‚Äôn. v. FCC, 299 F.3d 415.422 (D.C. Cir. 2002), cert. Denied, 123 S. Ct. 1571 (2003) In particular the FCC removed the requirement for ILECs to unbundle Fiber-to-the‚ÄìHome, and abolished line sharing as an unbundled element. Additionally, the FCC prohibited access to UNEs for the exclusive service to mobile wireless services and long distance services, and removed unbundled switching from the list of UNEs. Pricing for unbundled access is regulated by powers granted to a State commission. A just and reasonable rate is determined on a nondiscriminatory basis and is based on cost of providing the interconnection or unbundled network element. Provisions in the legislation also allow for these pricing structures to include a reasonable profit for the provider. The failure to determine a just and reasonable rate would mean that the incumbent LEC would be unable to recover and receive a reasonable return on its costs, effectively making the incumbent LEC's shareholders subsidize entering competitors.See J. Gregory Sidak & Daniel F. Spulber, The Tragedy of the Telecommons: Government Pricing of Unbundled Network Elements Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 97 COLUM. L. REV. 1081, 1084 (1997), https://ssrn.com/abstract=964703. This option allows companies, such as cable television, wireless providers, and electric/gas utilities, who already have customers, installation and maintenance crews, and billing systems, to lease the network elements they are missing, such as voice switches or electronic ordering systems, to complete their local telephone system. The 1996 Act, thus mandates that the traditional vertical hierarchy of the telephone industry be divided into parts, known as Unbundled Network Elements (UNE), so that competitive new entrants can choose what they need to provide competitive local telecommunications service. Mail In the United Kingdom, Downstream access (DSA) was first introduced in 2003. Mail which has been collected, sorted and distributed by a competitor (challenger), but is handed over to Royal Mail for delivery (the last mile). The ability to utilise the Royal Mail network in this way ended a 350-year monopoly.

He was often referred to as W. A. Spinks, and occasionally Billy Spinks. In addition to being amateur Pacific Coast Billiards Champion several times, a world-champion contender in more than one cue sports discipline, and an exhibition player in Europe, he became the co-inventor (with William Hoskins) of modern billiard cue chalk in 1897. He was originally (and again in retirement from the billiards circuit) a Californian, but spent much of his professional career in Chicago, Illinois. At his peak, his was a household name in American billiards; The New York Times ranked Spinks as one of \\"the most brilliant players among the veterans of the game\\", and he still holds the world record for points scored in a row (1,010) using a particular shot type. Aside from his billiards-playing career, he founded a lucrative sporting goods manufacturing business. He was both an oil company investor and director, and a flower- and fruit-farm operator and horticulturist, originator of the eponymous Spinks cultivar of avocado.  As an inventor (1892‚Äì97)  While Spinks was a world-class player, his lasting contributions to cue sports were the innovations he brought to the game and the industry resulting from his fascination with the abrasives used by players on the leather of their cue sticks. (used since at least 1807) helps the tip better grip the on a and prevents , as well as permitting the player to impart a great deal more to the ball, vital for and for spin-intensive shots, such as . In the 1800s, true chalk (generally calcium carbonate lumps, suspended from strings), and even plaster was often used, but players experimented with other powdery, abrasive substances, since true chalk had a deleterious effect on the game equipment, not only discoloring the billiard cloth but also allegedly damaging the fabric. In 1892, Spinks was particularly impressed by a piece of natural chalk-like substance obtained in France, and presented it to chemist and electrical engineer William Hoskins (1862‚Äì1934) of Chicago for analysis. Hoskins determined it was porous volcanic rock (pumice) originally probably from Mount Etna, Sicily. Using the rock as a starting place, the two experimented together with different formulations of various materials to achieve the cue ball \\"\\" that Spinks sought. The top of a box of a dozen cubes of Spinks billiard chalk, c. 1900‚Äì1910}}; the box bears an endorsement by world champion Jacob Schaefer Sr., often Spinks's opponent as a touring pro. They eventually narrowed their search to a mixture of Illinois-sourced silica and the abrasive substance corundum or aloxite (a form of aluminum oxide, Al2O3), founding William A. Spinks & Company with a factory in Chicago after securing a patent on March 9, 1897. Spinks later left the company as an active party, but it retained his name and was subsequently run by Hoskins, and later by Hoskins's cousin Edmund F. , after Hoskins moved on to other projects. While regular calcium carbonate chalk had been packaged and marketed on a local scale by various parties (English player Jack Carr's \\"twisting powder\\" of the 1820s being the earliest recorded example, although considered dubious by some billiards researchers), the Spinks Company product (which is still emulated by modern manufacturers with differing, proprietary compounds) effectively revolutionized billiards. The modern product provided a cue tip friction enhancer that allowed the tip to better grip the cue ball briefly and impart a previously unattainable amount of spin on the ball, which consequently allowed more precise and extreme , made miscueing less likely, made and shots more plausible, and ultimately spawned the new cue sport of artistic billiards. Even the basic and shots of pool games (such as eight-ball and nine-ball) depend heavily on the effects and properties of modern billiard chalk. Spinks made a fortune from his co-invention and the company that sold it to the world.  As a player  Spinks was a formidable specialist and professional competitor in straight rail billiards, and later balkline billiards. = 1890s: Rise as a professional contender = He moved from California to the East Coast, as it was the center of high-quality American playing in the era.

He also played a 14.2 balkline match against World Champion Jacob Schaefer Sr.; Schaefer won, 250‚Äì162, with a high and average of 88 and 20 (respectively) to Spinks's 33 and 13. In 1894, he was living in Cincinnati, Ohio, and in January of that year offered a convoluted challenge to veteran Edward McLaughlin of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to play him either a single 14.2 match to 600 for US$500 each (a substantial amount of money in that period for someone to put up personally on a bet ‚Äì approximately $ in modern dollars) in New York City, or one in New York and one in Philadelphia, one in Cincinnati and one in Philadelphia, whatever McLaughlin preferred, and even offered to pay travel expenses to Cincinnati. Spinks issued an even more curious challenge in November 1894, to play 14.2 balkline against (almost) any challenger to 600 points for a $1,000 pot again, and while including French champion Edward Fournil, the bet specifically the top-three names in that era of the sport, namely Shaefer, Ives and George Franklin Slosson. The challenge was accepted by well-known Chicago pro Thomas Gallagher (in a match that future champion Ora Morningstar traveled all the way to Chicago to see). Spinks was apparently not a fan of upstart cueist Ives in particular. Days after issuing his caveat-laden challenge, Spinks was described by an onlooking journalist as \\"very uneasy until the seventeenth inning\\" as a spectator at the 14.2 balkline World Champion challenge between Ives and incumbent Schaefer; the latter's point total had been trailing, sometimes badly, in all sixteen previous until he rallied in the final inning of the . Spinks, along with Gallagher, even helped Schaefer train in 14.2 for another match against Ives, in October of that year; though Spinks lost this practice match 600‚Äì369 (averages 23 vs. 14), he had a high of 109, to Schaefer's 102 (and Gallagher's 157 ). Spinks was reported in the press in 1895 to be specifically desired as a competitor in an upcoming seven-man invitational tournament for \\"second class\\" professional players (i.e., not the top 3), organized by Daly, and with as much as $1,200 (approx. $ in modern dollars) . Spinks had moved to Chicago by 1896, and was perfecting his billiard chalk with Hoskins. That year he was noted for besting McLaughlin at 14.2 by a comfortable 2500‚Äì2300 margin (with averages of 11 vs. 10) in a five-evening 14.2 match for $250 (approx. $, in modern dollars), December 8‚Äì12, in Slosson's New York City billiard hall. At one point he had trailed rather badly, 1500‚Äì1880, after McLaughlin pulled off a stunning run of 140 (Spinks's highest recorded run of the match was 69). By 1897, the year of the launch of Spinks & Company, he had evidently overcome his seeming reluctance to face World Champions again (perhaps from having several years' experience with his own product prototypes). Spinks competed in (but did not win) a December 3 open tournament. The next month in Chicago, on January 15‚Äì21, 1898, there was a double-elimination, five-man invitational 18.2 balkline tournament. It was a handicapped event, featuring the five top players from the previous event ‚Äì Schaefer and Ives, as world champions, had to reach 600 points to Spinks's, William Catton's and George Butler Sutton's 260. Without having to rely on the handicap, Spinks beat Schaefer flat-out, 260‚Äì139 (with a high of 48 vs. Schaefer's 38) in his January 18 second game. Spinks (with a high run of \\"only\\" 44) was defeated in a very close 249‚Äì260 third game a day later by Catton (high run 56) ‚Äì by way of comparison, the same night Ives trounced Sutton by a whopping 400‚Äì160. By January 20, Spinks seemed to be running out of steam, as Sutton took him 260‚Äì118, (high runs 73 vs. 30), and he lost again 154‚Äì400 (with another high run of 44) to Ives a day later. (In Spinks's defense, he not only did better against Ives than Catton had, but Ives also had a very impressive high run of 136, making it virtually impossible to catch up.) This loss put Spinks out of the tournament at 4th place. = 1900s: World-class competitor = Spinks was still considered a newsworthy contender over a decade later, for the World 18.2 Balkline Championship of 1909, being enumerated in \\"a fine list of entries\\" anticipated for the March event. On January 11, Spinks (with a high run of 51) beat former amateur champion and then-pro Calvin Demarest, 250‚Äì199, in only 15 innings ‚Äì despite scoring 0 points in 4 innings and only 1-point in another ‚Äì by building several solid runs in the innings in which things went his way. For all intents and purposes it was a 10-inning win. Demarest took his revenge only days later, defeating Spinks in a close 250‚Äì225, 23-inning game on January 13, despite Spinks's high run of 78 (his highest 18.2 run on record in publicly available sources, and considerably higher than Demarest's 52 that night). Spinks lost to him again the very next day, 175‚Äì250, in an exhibition game, though Spinks had a solid high run of 69. In January 1909, just prior to an 18.1 balkline championship at Madison Square Garden (in which Spinks was not competing), he and Maurice Daly were observed playing practice games with Sutton for the latter's pre-event training, in Daly's billiard hall in New York City, on multiple occasions over a several-day stretch. While Spinks lost all but one of the recorded matches of this series, one loss was by a single point, at 400‚Äì399, and another was a close 400‚Äì370. His victory was 300‚Äì194 ‚Äì surprising given that 18.1 was not his preferred game. Many articles of the era stress that Spinks was a Californian; during this period, American billiards was completely dominated by East-Coasters and a few Midwesterners. = 1910s‚Äì1920s: Setting a record and helping level the field = Spinks was noted in 1912 for a still-unbroken world record at 18.2 balkline, a of 1,010 continuous points, using the \\"\\" (a form of ); he could have made more, but stopped. Later, rules were instituted especially to curtail the effectiveness of the chuck nurse. The use of such repetitive, predictable shots by Spinks, Schaefer Sr., and their contemporaries led to the development of the more advanced and restrictive 14.1 balkline rules (invented in 1907, but not played professionally until 1914), which thwarted the ease of reliance on nurse shots even further than the older balkline games already did. In August 1915, Spinks was tapped to join a consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, organized by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, at that time the organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged ‚Äì his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected to level the playing field in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks. Well into the 1920s, Spinks was still a well-respected figure in the billiards industry, and wrote articles for publications such as Billiards Magazine, in which he sometimes focused on rather esoteric topics, as in his January 1923 piece on \\"Ventilation of Billiard Rooms\\" in an era when tobacco smoking was prevalent.  As an oilman and farm operator  Spinks in 1924 (passport photo from U.S. Department of State microfilm) He invested money from his billiard equipment corporation in the petroleum industry in California. Spinks described himself as a director of an oil company at the 1900 census. While Spinks was not known to have been operating a farm in 1900, the W. A. Spinks Ranch was a large enough operation by 1909 to employ a staff of farmhands, and included land in Bradbury Canyon, near Duarte, California, where Spinks resided at the time. He described himself as a flower farmer (among other such specialists in the area) in 1910, and later as an \\"avocado rancher\\". As a pomology horticulturist, he developed the Spinks avocado cultivar. Spinks was active in the growers' community, and in 1922 hosted a large regional farm bureau meeting of avocado farmers at his ranch-land \\"mountain estate\\". Although active as a floriculturist, Spinks made no known lasting contributions to that field. = Spinks avocado = Spinks's variety of avocado, Persea americana 'Spinks', was developed by him at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a University of California at Berkeley and California Avocado Association comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be more resistant to freezing than other avocados. It also proved to be the second- longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested. Considered \\"famous\\" by 1918, the Duarte-based Spinks avocado orchards were contracted to supply seedlings in 1919 for the palace of Xu Shichang, President of China (before communism), and other prestigious gardens in Asia. The Spinks varietal was eventually supplanted in popularity by the Hass avocado, the dominant commercial strain today.  Private life  William A. Spinks Jr., the youngest of five children, was born July 11, 1865, in the then-small township of San Jose, California, to struggling farmer William Sr. and wife Cynthia J. (Prather) Spinks. He had blue eyes, dark hair and a ruddy complexion, and was tall by adulthood. His education is obscure. William and Clara Spinks in 1922 (passport photo from U.S. Department of State microfilm) On September 1, 1891, Spinks married Clara Alexandria Karlson (b. December 12, 1871, Gothenburg, Sweden, immigrated 1872; d. October 4, 1949, Los Angeles); they were to remain together for over 40 years. They returned to California from Chicago before the turn of the century. After a period in a San Francisco apartment (c. 1900), they lived in the then-rural Los Angeles suburbs of Duarte (c. 1910) where their farm was, and Monrovia (later, by 1920) where they maintained a modest house. After William's business success, the couple became extensive world travelers. William Spinks died January 15, 1933, aged 67, in Monrovia, California. In Los Angeles County's San Gabriel Valley, Spinks Canyon, its stream Spinks Canyon Creek, and the local major residential thoroughfare Spinks Canyon Road (running through Duarte's northernmost residential area, Duarte Mesa), are named after him.

The Fleet Model 7B and Model 7C, known respectively as Fawn I and Fawn II were purchased by the RCAF as primary trainers. After years of reliable service, many were available for use in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during the Second World War while others remained as station \\"hacks.\\" Design and development As a subsidiary of Consolidated Aircraft set up in 1928, Fleet Aircraft had factories at Buffalo, NY, and across the border at Fort Erie, Ontario. The Canadian company produced a series of single-engined, two-seat training aircraft, based on US designs but including variants adapted specifically to Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) needs. The Fleet Model 7 began as an American design, the Model 2, originally designed by Consolidated. Besides two prototypes imported from the US, a total of seven Fleet Model 2 trainers were built in Canada for civilian operators. Derived from earlier Fleet Model 2, the Model 7 featured an aircraft structure consisting of a fabric-covered, welded-steel fuselage with metal panels forward of the wooden cockpits. It had steel-tube faring formers and wooden stringers. The wings were single bay of equal spans and wire braced. The upper wing was made in one piece and constructed with two solid Spruce spars. Ailerons were found only on the bottom wings. Stamped aluminium alloy ribs were used to construct the wings and steel-tube compression struts were at the interplane and centre section of the wings. Interlaced between the wings were streamlined landing and flying wires. Except for a broader chord tail-fin introduced after the first production series, while retaining the original rudder of the Model 2, the Model 7 was superficially identical to its earlier predecessor. A variety of equipment could be fitted to the Canadian variant including optional wheel brakes, a tail skid or tail wheel arrangement, a fuselage belly tank and a fixed cockpit enclosure or \\"coupe top\\" with hinged sides. During the late 1930s, a sliding cockpit enclosure became standard equipment of all RCAF Fawns. The aircraft could also be configured to use skis, floats or wheels. The main landing gear's radius rods (the members joining the inner ends of the wheel axles to each opposing corner of the fuselage) on the Models 2 and 7 were notable for having the one coming from the left wheel \\"looped\\", with an open oval piece near its middle, so the one from the right mainwheel could pass right through it. Engine choices further dictated the different variants of the Fawn design: the Mk I (Fleet Model 7B) with a Kinner B-5 engine was superseded by the Mk II (Fleet Model 7C) powered by a Armstrong Siddeley Civet seven-cylinder radial engine. Although the RCAF ordered the bulk of the production runs, 12 civil-registered Model 7Bs were completed for the Department of National Defence to be issued to flying clubs. Operational history The Fleet Model 7 first saw service with the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1931 when 20 Mk Is were delivered. As a two-seater primary trainer they were felt to have excellent flying characteristics together with a rugged strength which inspired confidence in novice pilots. The RCAF was very impressed with the Fleet Fawn and claimed that the aircraft was one of the factors which improved its flying standards during the 1930s. A total of 31 Model 7Cs were built between 1931 and 1938 at the Fleet Aircraft of Canada's plant at Fort Erie, Ontario, with the first deliveries made in 1936. Due to the smoother, quieter and more powerful engine, the Model 7C was considered the definitive variant. Forty three Fleet Model 7B and C trainers were operational with the Royal Canadian Air Force when war was declared in 1939. In service during the Second World War, the RCAF adopted the name \\"Fawn\\" for both variants. Along with the more modern follow-up design, the Fleet Finch, Fleet Fawns helped train thousands of pilots under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during the war. The Fawn remained in service with the RCAF until 1947. Variants ;Model 7A: One example completed with a Kinner K-5 radial engine ;Fleet Model 7B (Fawn Mk I): 32 examples with a Kinner B-5 engine five-cylinder, radial engine (earliest series also had a five cylinder Armstrong Siddeley Genet radial engine and a \\"left-hand\\" prop) ;Fleet Model 7C (Fawn Mk II): 31 examples with a Armstrong Siddeley Civet seven-cylinder, radial engine ;Model 7G: A \\"one-off\\" conversion of a Model B with a de Havilland Gipsy III, four-cylinder, inline engine (converted back to Model 7B standard) ;CATA (Fleet) 150: A conversion of Fleet 7 biplanes in Argentina, powered by Lycoming O-320 engines.

Bronson was born on July 8, 1894, in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. He attended the University of Washington where he majored in forestry and, from 1912 to 1916, played on the Washington Huskies football team. The University of Washington has erected a monument http://www.wastweetstudio.com/csUWMedalofHonor.html to commemorate eight alumni who have received the Medal Of Honor. No other non-service University has as many. Bronson joined the Army from Seattle, Washington, and by September 26, 1918, was serving in France as a first lieutenant with Company H of the 364th Infantry Regiment, 91st Division. On the first day of the Meuse- Argonne Offensive, near the village of Eclisfontaine, he was wounded by a grenade but continued to fight and helped capture an enemy dugout. Shot in the arm later that day, he refused medical evacuation and remained with his unit through the night. The next morning, after joining a company which was on the front line of an attack, he assisted in the capture of Eclisfontaine and an enemy machine gun position. As the company withdrew, he was wounded a third time by an artillery shell, but again refused to be evacuated and remained with his men all night. Bronson recovered from his injuries and was awarded the Medal of Honor in the office of President Herbert Hoover on November 19, 1929. After the war, Bronson became an executive with a paint company in Ohio and New Jersey, and later worked in the family lumber business in Oregon. He died May 29, 1957, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. His grave can be found in Section 30, Lot 500.

One student senator, Ashley Miller, said that the UW already had many monuments to \\"rich, white men\\" (Boyington claimed partial Sioux ancestry and was not rich); another, Jill Edwards, questioned whether the UW should memorialize a person who killed others, summarized in the minutes as saying \\"she didn't believe a member of the Marine Corps was an example of the sort of person UW wanted to produce.\\"UW Senate minutes After its defeat, a new version of the original resolution was submitted that called for a memorial to all eight UW alumni who received the Medal of Honor after attending the UW.\\"A Resolution Calling a Memorial for UW Alumni awarded the Medal of Honor\\" , Resolution R-12-16, Associated Students of the University of Washington Student Senate, submitted 02/17/2006.

Barcelos is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a Crafts and Folk Art City. History Originally a Roman settlement, it expanded and became the seat of the First Duke of Bragan√ßa in the 15th century. The palace of the Dukes of Bragan√ßa was destroyed by an earthquake in 1755 and is now an open-air museum. Galo de Barcelos, often used as a symbol of Portugal The town's famous symbol is a rooster, in Portuguese called o galo de Barcelos (\\"the Rooster of Barcelos\\"). One of the many versions of this legend goes that a rich man threw a big party. When the party was over, the rich man noticed that his sterling cutlery was stolen by a guest. He accused a pilgrim and let him go to court. He protested his innocence, but the judge didn't believe him. The judge was about to eat a roasted rooster when the pilgrim said: \\"If I am innocent, this rooster will crow three times.\\" When the pilgrim was about to be lynched, the rooster crowed. The judge released the pilgrim. The story ends a few years later when the pilgrim returned and made a statue over the event. The town remains on the Portuguese Way path of the Camino de Santiago.

After passing through Lake San Cristobal, one of the larger natural lakes of Colorado, it is joined at Lake City by Henson Creek, and from there flows north. About 22 miles (35 km) north of Lake City, it enters the Lake Fork Canyon, and at the north end of the canyon, joins the Gunnison River just before it enters the Gunnison River canyon. For the purposes of this discussion, we will consider the lower Lake Fork Valley to be that part of the river between Lake City and the canyon. The area is not unlike many other areas in the west. Early on, it was Ute Indian land and when white men began moving into the area, using places and resources of the Utes, there were conflicts. The discovery of gold in Colorado brought numbers of prospectors into the mountains. To deal with these problems, a treaty was signed in 1868, giving much of western Colorado to the Utes. However, gold continued to attract prospectors to the area and troubles continued. To deal with it, a group of Ute leaders were taken to Washington, D.C. in 1873, and under protest, they signed the Brunot treaty which opened a large portion of the San Juan Mountains to prospectors and mining. Otto Mears, a man responsible for many of the railroads and roads in Colorado, hired Enos Hotchkiss to build a road into the Lake City area, from which it was to continue on to the west. Hotchkiss found gold near present Lake City in 1875, and the town was started. Thus began the era when minerals and mining defined much of the character of the Lake Fork area. Even at these early times, though, there were people who saw the beauty of the mountains and realized that the area had great resources for raising cattle, and so ranches, although secondary to mining, began. With more and more people in the area, there was need for mail and other services and the stagecoach became important. One of these stagecoach routes began at Sapinero, the small town at the intersection of the Lake Fork and the Gunnison Rivers. The route went up over Sapinero MesaSapinero Mountain Retrieved August 16, 2012.Mapcarta Retrieved August 16, 2012 on the east side of the Lake Fork Canyon. A small stream called Johnson Gulch (after an early squatter who built a cabin there) runs from the east to the Lake Fork river, just above the canyon. The stage road dropped into Johnson Gulch and then down into the valley of the Lake Fork. From there it went 2 miles (3 km) to the south where a stage station and large barn were built at what was later called Barnum Station. From there, it continued up the Lake Fork valley to Lake City. Only small amounts of minerals were able to be taken from the Lake City area in wagons and so pressure for a railroad developed. In 1881, the Denver and Rio Grande (D&RG;) built a rail line into Gunnison and then continued to the west to Sapinero. Although a branch had been planned for Lake City, the lack of money delayed it. Finally, in 1879, it was completed. This was the end of the stagecoach in this area. The rail line came up the Lake Fork Canyon and at Johnson Gulch, a water tank was built to provide water for the steam engines. This was called Madera Siding. The rail line continued to the area below Barnum Station where holding corrals were built, and this was an important loading place for cattle which were then shipped to Sapinero and from there on east across Marshall Pass. The major use of the rail line, however, was to carry increasing mineral wealth from the Lake City area. Ranchers along the valley were also dependent on the train to bring mail and needed supplies. As with so many other mining areas, the mines of Lake City began producing less and less. Finally in 1933, the rail line was making little money and was abandoned by the D&RG.; The line was purchased and called the San Cristobal Railroad, and a galloping goose was built to run on the tracks and to take mail and other things to and from Lake City. The galloping goose was a combination between a car and a railway car, built on a Pierce-Arrow body. It used a gasoline engine and could be driven up the railroad tracks and carry mail and limited amounts of freight. This was never very successful, though, and the rail line was completely abandoned in 1939. By this time, there were automobile roads into the area, and mail was brought into the valley from Gunnison in this way.

It targets TRAIL-R1, also known as DR4, which is expressed on the surface of many tumor cell types.  Development history  This drug was discovered by Cambridge Antibody Technology, now AstraZeneca, and Human Genome Sciences, now GlaxoSmithKline, as a result of the collaboration between the two companies in 1999 in exploitation of CAT's phage display technology. Early work by the two companies indicated that mapatumumab induced cell death in multiple tumor types both in vitro and in vivo.  Clinical trials  A phase 1 clinical trial in 2004 demonstrated the safety and tolerability of mapatumumab in cancer patients with advanced solid tumors or non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma, and supported further evaluation in phase 2 clinical trials, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. In a phase 2 clinical trial, mapatumumab was well tolerated and could be administered safely in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and advanced colorectal cancer. Stable disease was observed in a number of NSCLC patients. In two phase 1b clinical trials mapatumumab in combination with chemotherapy was well tolerated by patients with advanced solid tumors. Partial response was observed in a number of patients in each of the studies. The results of a phase 2 clinical trial demonstrated that mapatumumab was well tolerated and capable of producing clinical responses when administered as monotherapy in patients with advanced non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma, according to HGS. =Multiple myeloma= In 2008 HGS reported initial results of a randomised phase 2 trial of mapatumumab in combination with bortezomib in advanced multiple myeloma. However, in 2010, mapatumumab failed in a midstage study. There was no difference in disease response or progression-free survival rates between patients receiving the drug for multiple myeloma and the control group. =Non-small-cell lung cancer= \\"In August 2008, ... initial dosing of patients in a randomized Phase 2 trial of HGS-ETR1 (10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); initial data from the study are anticipated in 2009.\\" =Liver cancer= \\"In July 2008, HGS initiated dosing in ... a randomized Phase 2 trial of HGS-ETR1 in combination with Nexavar (sorafenib) in patients with advanced hepatocellular cancer, which accounts for 80-90% of all liver cancers.\\"  See also Lexatumumab  References  Monoclonal antibodies for tumors Experimental cancer drugs GlaxoSmithKline brands ","title":"Mapatumumab"},{"id":"9700674","text":"Ofatumumab, sold under the brand name Arzerra among others, is a fully human monoclonal antibody to CD20, which appears to inhibit early-stage B lymphocyte activation.

Likewise it is also advised that doctors watch cautiously for small bowel obstruction, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infusion reactions or an increased risk for infection. =Interactions= No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted with ofatumumab. Although it is advised that patients are not administered live virus vaccines (e.g. the oral polio vaccine) while undergoing treatment with ofatumumab due to the compromised ability to fight the attenuated viruses seen in patients being treated with ofatumumab. Mechanism Ofatumumab is a humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody whose epitope is distinct from that of rituximab. The CD20 antigen is expressed on solely B cell lymphocytes. Compared with rituximab, ofatumumab binds more tightly to CD20 with a slower off-rate. It causes cytotoxicity in the cells that express CD20 by means of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). History Ofatumumab (Arzerra) was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2009. Ofatumumab (Arzerra) was approved for medical use in the European Union in June 2010, and for use in Canada in August 2012. It was approved for use in the UK in April 2010.

It was first described by Tadeusz Reichstein in 1938 as Substance S, thus has also been referred to as Reichstein's Substance S or Compound S. Function Steroidogenesis, showing 11-deoxycortisol in the pathway from cholesterol to cortisol.11-Deoxycortisol acts as a glucocorticoid, though is less potent than cortisol. 11-Deoxycortisol is synthesized from 17Œ±-hydroxyprogesterone by 21-hydroxylase and is converted to cortisol by 11Œ≤-hydroxylase. 11-Deoxycortisol in mammals has limited biological activity and mainly acts as an intermediate product within the glucocorticoid pathway, leading to cortisol. In sea lamprey, a member of the agnathans that evolved more than 500 million years ago, 11-deoxycortisol is the major and final glucocorticoid, with mineralocorticoid activity. Sea lamprey do not have 11Œ≤-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP11B1) that converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone in mammals. This indicates that a complex and highly specific corticosteroid signaling pathway evolved at least 500 million years ago with the arrival of the earliest vertebrate. The absence of cortisol and corticosterone in sea lampreys suggests that the 11Œ≤-hydroxylase enzyme may not have been present early in vertebrate evolution. Clinical significance 11-Deoxycortisol in mammals has limited glucocorticoid activity, but it is the direct precursor of the major mammalian glucocorticoid, cortisol. As a result, the level of 11-deoxycortisol is measured to diagnose impaired cortisol synthesis, to find out the enzyme deficiency that causes impairment along the pathway to cortisol, and to differentiate adrenal disorders. In 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone levels increase, and excess of 11-deoxycorticosterone leads to mineralocorticoid- based hypertension (as opposed to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, in which patients have low blood pressure from a lack of mineralocorticoids). In 11Œ≤-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycortisol can also be converted to androstenedione in a pathway that could explain the increase in androstenedione levels this condition. In 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11-deoxycortisol levels are low.  History  In 1934, biochemist Tadeus Reichstein, working in Switzerland, began research on extracts from animal adrenal glands in order to isolate physiologically active compounds. He was publishing results of his findings along the way. By 1944, he already isolated and elucidated the chemical structure of 29 pure substances. He was assigning names that consisted of the word \\"Substance\\" and a letter from the Latin alphabet to the newly found substances. In 1938, he has published an article about \\"Substance R\\" and \\"Substance S\\" describing their chemical structures and properties. The Substance S since about 1955 became known as 11-Deoxycortisol. In the 1930s and 1940s clinicians were discovering many uses for the newly discovered hormones, however, only minute quantities could be extracted from animal organs. Chemists were looking for production of these hormones on a larger industrial scale. In 1949, American research chemist Percy Lavon Julian, in looking for ways to produce cortisone, announced the synthesis of the Compound S, from the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol stigmasterol). On April 5, 1952, biochemist Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn, published the first report of a breakthrough fermentation process for the microbial 11Œ±-oxygenation of steroids (e.g. progesterone) in a single step by common molds of the order Mucorales. 11Œ±-oxygenation of Compound S produces 11Œ±-hydrocortisone, which can be chemically oxidized to cortisone, or converted by further chemical steps to 11Œ≤-hydrocortisone (cortisol).

The two cases were Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis. The U.S. federal government had issued paper money known as United States Notes during the American Civil War, pursuant to the terms of the Legal Tender Act of 1861. In the 1869 case of Hepburn v. Griswold, the Court had held that the Legal Tender Act violated the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase did not hold that Congress lacked the power to issue paper money, but rather ruled that the notes could not be used as legal tender for pre-existing debts. The Supreme Court overruled Hepburn v. Griswold in the Legal Tender Cases, holding that United States Notes could be used to re-pay pre-existing debts. Legal Tender Act of 1862 Obverse of the first $1 bill, issued in 1862 as a legal tender note featuring Treasury Secretary Chase, who later held as Chief Justice that such bills are unconstitutional, before being overturned The Legal Tender Cases primarily involved the constitutionality of the Legal Tender Act of 1862, , enacted during the American Civil War.Act of Congress, Statutes at Large, Volume 12, 37th Congress, Session II, Chapter 33, pp. 345‚Äì348 (1862-02-25). This Act authorized issuance of $150,000,000 in United States Notes, commonly referred to as greenbacks, plus $500,000,000 in interest-bearing bonds. The Act authorized issuance of paper money, United States Notes, to finance the war without raising taxes.Newcomer, Philip. The Illegality of Legal Tender, The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty, December 1986, Vol. 36 No. 12. The paper money depreciated in terms of gold and became the subject of controversy, particularly because debts contracted earlier could be paid in this cheaper currency.Legal Tender cases, The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001‚Äì05.

On the same day that Hepburn was decided, President Ulysses Grant nominated two new justices to the Court, Joseph Bradley and William Strong, although Grant later denied that he had known about the decision in Hepburn when the nominations were made.Pusey, Merlo. Matter of Delicacy: The Court Copes With Disability , Supreme Court Historical Society 1979 Yearbook. Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis Justices Bradley and Strong subsequently voted to reverse the Hepburn decision, in Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis, by votes of 5‚Äì4.. Juilliard v. Greenman The constitutionality of the Act was more broadly upheld thirteen years later in Juilliard v. Greenman.. Background about constitutionality of paper money Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution explicitly forbids the states from issuing \\"bills of credit\\" (promissory notes) or making anything but gold and silver coin legal \\"tender\\". There are no corresponding explicit prohibitions limiting the power of the federal government, nor are there any explicit authorizations. The Tenth Amendment refers to reserved powers that only the states can exercise, as well as powers not delegated that continue to reside in the people. \\"Concurrent powers\\" also exist, which may be exercised by either the states or the federal government, such as the power to repel invasions, and arguably including power to make legal tender (e.g. in federal territories or elsewhere). Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution specifically gives Congress power to \\"borrow money\\" and also power to \\"coin money and regulate the value\\" of both U.S. and foreign coins, and regulate interstate commerce, but does not explicitly and unambiguously grant Congress the power to print paper money or make it legal tender. The federal government first issued paper money in 1861 to fund the Civil War.Friedberg, Arthur and Friedberg, Ira. Paper Money of the United States: A Complete Illustrated Guide With Valuations: \\"From the first year of Federal paper money, 1861, to the present. ... \\" Before that, all U.S. paper money was bank-issued money. For example, paper notes were issued by the First Bank of the United States, which was a private corporation chartered by the federal government.Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Fun Facts About Money. Retrieved 2007-02-24. Congress had also authorized paper money (e.g. Continentals) even before the Constitution was adopted. The Continental was issued by both the individual states and the Continental Congress under the Articles of Confederation. Those Articles specifically allowed the issuance of legal tender paper money, at the time called \\"bills of credit.\\"The Articles of Confederation stated: \\"The United States in Congress assembled shall have authority ... to borrow money, or emit bills on the credit of the United States\\" In Hepburn, Chief Justice Chase noted, \\"No one questions the general constitutionality, and not very many, perhaps, the general expediency of the legislation by which a note currency has been authorized in recent years. The doubt is as to the power to declare a particular class of these notes to be a legal tender in payment of pre-existing debts.\\"Hepburn, 75 U.S. at 619. =Original intent and original meaning= Originalists like Robert Bork have objected to enforcing the intentions of those framers who may have believed that paper money should be prohibited: \\"Scholarship suggests that the Framers intended to prohibit paper money. Any judge who thought today he would go back to the original intent really ought to be accompanied by a guardian rather than be sitting on a bench.\\"Hearings Before Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 100th Congress, 1st Session, Nomination of Robert H. Bork to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (1987). According to law professor Michael Stokes Paulson, \\"Among the most common canards in critiques of originalism is that, under the original meaning of the Constitution, the issuance of paper money as legal tender would be unconstitutional, sending our economy into disarray.\\"Paulsen, Michael Stokes. \\"How to Interpret the Constitution (and How Not To) ,\\" 115 Yale Law Journal 2037, 2061 n. 46 (2006). Regarding paper money, Nathaniel Gorham explained at the Constitutional Convention that he \\"was for striking out\\" an explicit power of Congress to issue paper money, but Gorham was also against \\"inserting any prohibition.\\"The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 , ed. Madison, James (1787-08-16). Retrieved 2007-02-24. One delegate at the Constitutional Convention went so far as to say that an express power to emit paper money would be \\"as alarming as the mark of the Beast in Revelation\\". That is what ultimately happened at the Convention: language explicitly giving the federal government power to issue legal tender paper money was removed on a vote of 9‚Äì2, but an option allowing the issuance together with a prohibition against making it legal tender was not acted upon. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress power to \\"borrow money on the credit of the United States,\\" and therefore Gorham envisioned that \\"The power [e.g. to emit promissory paper], as far as it will be necessary or safe, is involved in that of borrowing.\\"Siegan, Bernard.. The Supreme Court's Constitution, (1987), page 36: \\"The central government would be able to emit promissory paper 'as it will be necessary or safe' pursuant to the borrowing power.\\" The power to emit paper money (e.g. bank notes) has been justified by invoking the Necessary and Proper Clause in combination with the other enumerated powers which include the power to borrow money.Siegan, Bernard. The Supreme Court's Constitution, (1987), page 27: \\"Because the power was not banned, Congress could print paper money and designate it legal tender under its necessary and proper power (article I, section 8, clause 18) once the required relationship to an enumerated power had been established.\\" The power to \\"issue bills of credit\\" is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as a prohibition on the States, and could therefore be interpreted as a power so momentous that it would have to be conferred explicitly on the federal government rather than inferred from the Necessary and Proper Clause, although it is not entirely clear whether or not the framers intended such an interpretation, nor did the Supreme Court adopt such an interpretation in the Legal Tender Cases or subsequently. James Madison's notes, from the Constitutional Convention in 1787, include a footnote where he says that the Constitution would not allow the federal government to use paper as currency or legal tender, though there is no indication whether or not the contents of his footnote were uttered aloud at the Convention.The Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 , ed. Madison, James (1787-08-16). Retrieved 2007-02-24. The full text of Madison's footnote is as follows: \\"This vote in the affirmative by Virga. was occasioned by the acquiescence of Mr. Madison who became satisfied that striking out the words would not disable the Govt. from the use of public notes as far as they could be safe & proper; & would only cut off the pretext for a paper currency, and particularly for making the bills a tender either for public or private debts.\\" Thereafter, during the ratification debates, the Federalist Papers No. 44 (assumed to be authored by Madison) said that prohibiting states from emitting \\"bills of credit must give pleasure to every citizen, in proportion to his love of justice and his knowledge of the true springs of public prosperity.\\" He further stated that the issuance of paper money by the states had resulted in \\"an accumulation of guilt, which can be expiated no otherwise than by a voluntary sacrifice of the power which has been the instrument of it.\\"Madison, James.

She has published twelve books. Singh's art reflects and expands on the ways in which people relate to photographic images. Her recent works, drawn from her extensive photographic oeuvre, are a series of mobile museums that allow her images to be endlessly edited, sequenced, archived and displayed. Stemming from her interest in the archive, the museums present her photographs as interconnected bodies of work that are full of both poetic and narrative possibilities. Publishing is also a significant part of Singh's practice. She has created multiple \\"book-objects\\" ‚Äì works that are concurrently books, art objects, exhibitions, and catalogues ‚Äì often with the publisher Steidl. Museum Bhavan has been shown at the Hayward Gallery, London (2013), the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt (2014), the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago (2014) and the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi (2016). Singh was awarded the Prince Claus Award in 2008. In 2013, she became the first Indian to have a solo show at London's Hayward Gallery. Early life and background Singh was born in Delhi in 1961. She was the oldest of four sisters. Singh studied Visual Communication at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad and later Documentary Photography at the International Center of Photography in New York City. She started her career in photojournalism and retired in the late 1990s. Career Singh's first foray into photography and bookmaking came through a chance encounter with tabla player Zakir Hussain, when he invited her to photograph him in rehearsal after she was shoved by an aggressive official while attempting to shoot him in concert. For six winters following this, Singh documented several Hussain tours and, in 1986, finally published the images in her first book, Zakir Hussain. Referring to him as her first \\"true guru\\", Singh believes that Hussain taught her the most important of all skills: focus. Singh's second book, Myself Mona Ahmed was published in 2001, after more than a decade spent on assignment as a photojournalist. A mix of photobook, biography, autobiography and fiction, this 'visual novel' emerged as a result of her refusal to be the subject of what could have been a routine but problematic photojournalistic project as well as her discomfort with the West's tendency to view India through simplistic, exotic lenses. Dayanita Singh in the National Museum, New Delhi, 2014. In the years following this, publishing has been a significant part of Singh's practice. She has created multiple \\"book-objects\\" ‚Äì works that are concurrently books, art objects, exhibitions, and catalogues‚Äîoften in collaboration with the publisher Gerhard Steidl in G√∂ttingen, Germany. These include Privacy, Chairs, the direction-changing Go Away Closer, the seven-volume Sent a Letter, Blue Book, Dream Villa, Fileroom and Museum of Chance. Sent a Letter was included in the 2011 Phaidon Press book Defining Contemporary Art: 25 years in 200 Pivotal Artworks. Steidl said in a 2013 interview on Deutsche Welle television, \\"She is the genius of book making\\". Dream Villa was produced during her Robert Gardner Fellowship in Photography given annually by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University; Singh was its second recipient in 2008. The \\"book-object\\" medium has allowed Singh to explore her interest in the poetic and narrative possibility of sequence and re-sequence, allowing her to create photographic patterns while simultaneously disrupting them. Her books rarely include text; instead she lets the photographs communicate and speak for themselves. These ideas are furthered through her experimentation with alternate ways of producing and viewing photographs to explore how people relate to photographic images. Singh has created and displayed a series of mobile museums, giving her the space to constantly sequence, edit, and archive her images. These mobile museums stemmed in large part from Singh's interest in archives and the archival process. Her mobile museums are displayed in large wooden architectural structures that can be rearranged and opened or closed in various ways. Each holds 70 to 140 photographs that Singh rearranges for each show so that only a portion of the photos or parts of each images are visible at any given time, capitalizing on the interconnected and fluid capacity of her work while allowing ample opportunity for evolving narratives and interpretations. Museum Bhavan has been shown at the Hayward Gallery, London (2013), the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt (2014), the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago (2014) and the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art, New Delhi (2016). Singh's works have also been presented at the German pavilion in the Venice Biennale. In 2009, the Fundaci√≥n MAPFRE in Madrid organised a retrospective of her work, which subsequently travelled to Amsterdam, Bogota and Umea. Her pictures of \\"File Rooms\\" were first presented in the exhibition, Illuminazione, at the 2011 Venice Biennale. In 2014, at the National Museum, New Delhi, Singh built the Book Museum using her publications File Room and Privacy as well as her mother's book, Nony Singh: The Archivist. And she also displayed a part of Kitchen Museum which are accordion-fold books with silver gelatin prints in 8 teak vitrines that she makes as letters to fellow travellers or conservationists since 2000. Seven of these were published by Steidl as \\"Sent a Letter\\". Singh also presented the Museum of Chance as a book-object for the first time in India in November 2014 at a show in the Goethe-Institut in Mumbai and in January 2015 at a show in the Goethe-Institut / Max Mueller Bhavan in New Delhi. The book-object is a work that is a book, an art object, an exhibition and a catalogue, all at once. In order to move away from showing editioned prints framed on the wall, Singh made the book itself the art object: a work to be valued, looked at and read as such, rather than being regarded as a gathering of photographic reproductions. In 2018 Singh released Museum Bhavan as a book. It is an \\"exhibition\\" in the form of a book, with \\"galleries\\" held in a small box containing nine thin accordion books that expand to a 7.5-foot-long gallery of black and white photos drawn from Singh's archive. In 2017 Museum Bhavan won PhotoBook of the Year in the Paris Photo‚ÄìAperture Foundation PhotoBook Awards and in 2018 was awarded the Infinity Award of the International Center of Photography.

It tells the story of the Omegans, who are at war with the Vandals. In the game, the player controls an Omegan pilot who is being ambushed by Vandal pilots, motorcyclists, and truck drivers. The format of the game has two different modes. The first is a very large scale view in which the player navigates a plane to target the next battle. Tiny icons represent the enemy planes, motorcycles, and trucks, as well as the Omegan plane, airfield (representing the remaining planes), some factories, and a blimp used for reloading ammunition. The second mode is a split-screen view including a side view and a top down view, with different controls to maneuver the plane on each view. It is in this mode that the actual battle takes place, where the player must shoot down enemy planes without being shot down, or shoot motorcycles or truck tires without hitting the ground. A wise player would protect his factories and airfield from the motorbikes and trucks, which destroy those structures upon contact. Once these ground vehicles are gone, a heat-seeking rocket is launched, targeting the player mercilessly. Destroying the rocket ends the wave. At the end of each wave, the player is given extra planes based on any remaining factories. The waves are designated by letters of the Greek alphabet. Once all the player's planes are destroyed, the game is over, and a rank is assigned corresponding to the highest wave reached: Alpha Turkey, Beta Beginer [sic], Gamma Greenhorne , etc. See also *List of MS-DOS games DOS games DOS-only games 1984 video games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Flightmare"},{"id":"9700915","text":"Leigh Redhead, born 18 November 1971, in Adelaide, South Australia is an Australian mystery writer.

Ahl al- ra æy They were one of three main groups debating sources of Islamic law in the second century of Islam, the other two being ahl al-kalam (speculative theologians) and ashab al-hadith (the partisans of hadith who eventually prevailed). Its proponents, which included many early jurists of the Hanafi and Maliki schools, used the term ra'y to refer to \\"sound\\" or \\"considered\\" reasoning, such as qiyas (analogical deduction). Their opponents from the ahl al-hadith movement held that the Quran and authentic hadith were the only admissible sources of Islamic law, and objected to any use of ra'y in jurisprudence, whether in the form of qiyas, istislah (consideration of public interest), or hiyal (legal subterfuges). According to Daniel W. Brown, Ahl al- ra æy thought ahadith should \\"sometimes be subject to other overriding principles\\" such as the \\"continuous practice\\" of the Ummah (Muslim community) and \\"general principles of equity\\" which better represented \\"the spirit\\" of the Prophet of Islam. Over time, Hanafi and Maliki jurists gradually came to accept the primacy of the Quran and hadith advocated by the ahl al-hadith movement, restricting the use of other forms of legal reasoning to interpretation of these scriptures. In turn, Hanbali jurists, who had led the ahl al-hadith movement, gradually came to accept the use of qiyas as long as its application was strictly founded on scriptural sources.

The capital is Zebilla. It's part of the traditional kingdom of Kussaug. Kussasi is the main ethnic group and Kussal is the main language spoken in the area. History The Bawku West District was created in 1988 under the local government system by Legislative Instrument (LI) 1442. As the Kussasi kingdom of Kussaug, it is much older. Geography It is bordered to the north by the Republic of Burkina Faso, to the east by Binduri district, to the west by Talensi district and Nabdam district and to the south by East Mamprusi district. The district covers an area of approximately 1,070 square kilometres, which constitutes about 12% of the total land area of the Upper East Region. It is the fourth biggest district in the region in terms of land area. Demographics According to the 2010 population and housing census, the total population is 94,034 representing 9.0 percent of the region‚Äôs total population. Males constitute 48 percent and females represent 52 percent of the district‚Äôs population. Of the population 11 years and above, 39.0 percent are literate and 61.0 percent are non-literate. The proportion of literate males is higher (48.0%) than that of females (31.0%). that time. Kusaal is the dominant language in Zebilla. The majority of the inhabitants of the district are Kussasi, but there are also numerous Basari and Mossi from the adjacent kingdoms. Zebilla, like many other places in Northern part of Ghana has very shallow soil which is less rich in organic fertilizer. The weather conditions are harsh with little rainfall. Major crops that thrive well in the area are maize, sorghum, 'Nara', rice, soya beans, bambara beans and groundnut. Joy News reported that, a man called Apamsaiblik Azurago, 'defied the odds' and cultivated the first ever cocoa in the area. Economics Goods and commodity trading occur every three days in an open market in Zebilla. The same occurs in smaller townships like Sapeliga on the Burkina Faso border. The Zebilla market is at the district capital and it is the largest market in the district. There are other smaller markets like the Binaba market which is at Binaba zone, Tanga market which is at the Tanga zone, Sapeliga Market, at the Sapeliga Market. The smaller markets come a day after or every other day after Zebilla market day. Zebilla is noted for animal production. Guinea fowls, sheep, goat and dogs are mostly sold every market day. Dog meat is a delicacy among the traditional Kusasi people. Dogs are sold in open place every in all the small markets and people from the regional capital, Bolga come to all these places to buy them and process as a delicacy.

It is a product developed by Genmab in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Specifically, zalutumumab is designed for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), a type of cancer.  Mechanism of action  Zalutumumab works through inhibition of the EGFR signal. The EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Its structure includes an extracellular binding domain, a transmembrane lipophilic segment, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. = Mechanism of EGFR = EGFR is over-expressed by many tumor cells. Upon binding by a ligand, such as the epidermal growth factor or TGF alpha, dimerization occurs, leading to autophosphorylation on the intracellular tyrosine residues. Following phosphorylation, the Grb2-SOS signaling complex is stimulated. This causes the activation of the G protein RAS through the exchange of guanosine diphosphate (GDP) for guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The exchange of GDP for GTP induces a conformational change of RAS to allow it to bind to Raf-1. Raf-1 is then activated through another multistep mechanism in which dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), as well as the phosphorylation of activating sites by p21 activated kinase (PAK) occurs. After this, Raf-1 activates MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), which then goes on to activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK). ERK is then able to enter the cell nucleus and control gene expression by phosphorylating various transcription factors, such as Elk-1. It is from there that the specific gene transcription occurs to initiate the cell cycle. Through this mechanisam, apoptosis is inhibited, angiogenesis, migration, adhesion, and invasion occur. Each of these is a functional element to the progression and development of cancer, which is defined as an abnormal growth of cells with a tendency to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize.What is Cancer, MedicineNet.com = Mechanism of zalutumumab = In order to combat SCCHN, zalutumumab was designed to inhibit the EGFR signaling. Specifically, it binds to the EGFR Domain III on the cell surface. This locks the receptor in an inactive conformation, making the drug an inverse agonist. In doing this it is also acting as a competitive antagonist for the EGF ligand. In the inactive conformation, the distance between the intracellular tyrosine kinase residues is larger, which inhibits dimerization. Phosphorylation is consequently inhibited, so that no signal is released. Without a signal, cell cycle characteristics to enhance tumor growth are inhibited and the cancer progression is suppressed. This is not the only way in which zalutumumab works. It also is responsible for some antitumor affects through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The Fab, or fragment antigen binding region of the antibody, binds to the antigen on the EGFr expressing tumor cells. Through an immunological response, the body‚Äôs natural killer (NK) cells, which are a type of lymphocyte, recognize and bind to the Fc portion on the antibody through an Fc receptor, CD16. The NK cell is then activated through the cross linking of the Fc receptors which sends a signal to induce apoptosis and cell death. The target tumor cell is then destroyed.  Developmental status  2009: Zalutumumab treatment was approved for Fast Track status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for patients suffering from SCCHN who have failed standard therapies and have no other options. The drug has undergone pre-clinical and Phase I and II studies and is also in Phases I and II for SCCHN front-line with chemo-radiation and SCCHN with radiation. Additionally, a Phase II is under way for SCCHN and Phase III studies are also being performed for SCCHN and SCCHN front-line with radio therapy. 2010:A phase III study (of zalutumumab as an addition to 'best supportive care' in patients after failed standard platinum-based chemotherapy) reported a non-significant improvement in overall survival, and a significant 61% improvement in Progression-free survivalhttp://www.genengnews.com/news/bnitem.aspx?name=77261239 March 2010 2014:A study of zalutumumab as addition to chemoradiation for SCCHN showed no benefit, and 94% developed a skin rash (11% severe enough to discontinue). 2015:Genmab not proceeding with zalutumumab.

The capital is Tongo.  Background  Talensi-Nabdam, one of the newly created districts, was carved from the Bolgatanga District with Tongo as its capital. It has a population of about 94650. It is bordered to the north by the Bolgatanga District, to the south by the West and East Mamprusi Districts, to the west by the Kassena-Nanakana District and the east by the Bawku West District. The district lies between latitude 10.15¬∞ and 10.60¬∞ north of the Equator and longitude 0.31¬∞ and 10.50.  Physical and natural environment  = Topography and drainage = The district has gentle slopes ranging from 1% to 5% gradient with some isolated rocks while some upland slopes range around 10% at the Tongo and Nangodi areas. The district is drained mainly by the Red and White Volta and their tributaries. = Geology and soil = The rocks fall within the Birimian, Tarkwaian and Voltaria types of Ghana. There is evidence of presence of minerals, especially gold. = Climate = The climate is tropical with two distinct seasons, the wet (rainy) and dry (no rain). The rainy season is erratic, and runs from May to October each year with an annual mean of 950mm. The dry season is long and stretches from October to April. Temperatures can be with a maximum of 450 C in March and April with a minimum of 120C in December. = Vegetation = The vegetation is guinea savannah woodland consisting of short widely spread deciduous trees and a ground flora of grass, which get burnt by fire or sun scorch during the long dry season. The most common economic trees are the shea nuts, dawadawa, baobab and acacia. The district has three gazetted forest reserves covering a total area of 455.21 sq km; Nyokoko (established in 1954), Tankwiddi East and the Red Volta were respectively established in 1956. = Environmental situation = The natural environment is fairly degraded as it faces threat of severe drought with high temperatures and perennial outbreak of bush fires. It is evident that high population densities (especially in towns) with high demand for land for constructional activities, extensive cultivation, over-grazing, erratic rainfall and the extent of devastation do affect the natural environment thereby exposing it to desertification. Illegal surface mining is a major threat to the environment by degrading land and pollution of water bodies. = Water supply = Access to potable water is indeed a problem and the District Assembly and other development partners are working to collectively find a solution. Small Town Water System (STWS) have provided boreholes and hand-dug wells for many communities in the district with support from NGOs (ADRA, Rural Aid and WorldVision Ghana).  Labour force  The labour force in the district comprises agricultural labour, non- agricultural labour and casual labour. Under agricultural labour, family labour claims over 60% usually comprising men, women and children of age 15 years at least. The remaining 40% goes to non-agricultural labour and casual labour. The demand for labour is at its peak in the rainy season, when more farming activities are being carried out.  Agriculture (husbandry)  The District Agricultural Development Unit is geared towards ensuring food security all year round in collaboration with other development partners. Agriculture plays important roles in the socio-economic development of the Talensi-Nabdam District, aside food security; it provides employment and incomes for over 90% the population. The district has arable land area of 56% (49,200 ha) and 9,000 farm households with an average land holding of 1.2ha per household which falls below the National Average of 4ha. About 90% of its population is peasant farmers who grow mostly food crops. = Crops = The main crops cultivated by farmers during the rainy season are: * Cereals: millet, sorghum, rice, maize * Legumes: groundnuts, cowpea, soybean, bambara beans * Vegetables: tomato, pepper, okro, garden eggs, * Tubers: Sweet Potato, frafra potato. = Livestock = Apart from crop production, livestock and poultry rearing is the second most important feature in agricultural development. Almost all farmers are engaged in the rearing of at least one type of livestock and poultry. Livestock serves as a good source of income for farmers especially when there is crop failure. Production is largely at the subsistence level. The livestock reared include poultry (guinea fowls, fowls, ducks, and turkeys), cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and donkeys.

The company provides building and infrastructure construction in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal and Switzerland. Company history Ernest Go√ºin founded Ernest Go√ºin & Cie. in 1846. It later became Soci√©t√© de Construction des Batignolles (SCB). Meanwhile, the Soci√©t√© Parisienne pour l‚ÄôIndustrie des Chemins de Fer et des Tramways Electriques was founded and became, in 1900 under the directorship of baron √âdouard Empain, Soci√©t√© Parisienne pour l‚ÄôIndustrie Electrique (SPIE). As early as 1954, SPIE acquired part of SCB's capital and in 1968 the two companies merged to form Spie Batignolles. During the 1970s and 1980s, Spie Batignolles acquired several other companies: Compagnie Industrielle de Travaux (CITRA) in 1972, Canalisations P√©trolif√®res, Aquif√®res et Gazi√®res (CAPAG) in 1977, and Travaux Industriels pour l‚ÄôElectricit√© (TRINDEL) in 1982. In 1989 the rail construction company Drouard was acquired, forming the foundation of the group's rail construction engineering company Spie Rail. The 1990s brought several waves of restructuring. In 1990, Spie Batignolles created Spie Construction, the building and civil engineering branch of the company. In 1992, Spie Construction merged with CITRA to become SPIE CITRA. In 1997 the company was bought from the Schneider group with the help of a management buyout supported by AMEC. A year later, Spie Batignolles changed its name to SPIE with its three daughter companies becoming Spie Trindel, Spie Enertrans, and Spie Batignolles; operating the energy, transportation and construction fields respectively. On 1 July 2003, Spie as a whole was purchased by AMEC; the acquired company was split in three: the engineering branch of Spie in Europe was renamed AMEC SPIE, a rail construction business AMEC Spie Rail was created, and the remaining construction business was grouped under the name Spie Batignolles. AMEC announced that it would seek to sell the construction arm of the business 'Spie Batignolles', and entered negotiations to secure a management buyout of that division; the management buyout of the construction division by 78 senior managers was completed in September 2003 with the aid of Barclays Private Equity Finance. In 2004, Financi√®re Spie Batignolles purchased the remaining Spie Batignolles shares owned by Amec Spie. The two other former divisions became separate companies: in 2005 AMEC announced it was to sell its Spie acquisition of 2003. the engineering company AMEC SPIE was sold to PAI Partners for ‚Ç¨1040 million in 2006, The European rail business joint venture Amec Spie Rail systems was sold for an estimated ¬£200million in 2007, to Colas Group.

It was founded in 1968,Timothy Miller, \\"The Historical Communal Roots of Ultraconservative Groups\\", in with the watchword \\"free land for free people\\". It has been considered by some participants and commentators to be one of the more radical examples of communal living/intentional communities that grew out of the counterculture of the 1960s. Before being converted into a commune, it was a ghost town that had been a gold mining settlement in the 1860s. The commune's legal ownership was held by one resident, Richard Marley,Black Bear Ranch website, Black Bear Family Trust Document until in 1987 it was transferred to the Black Bear Family Trust, which limits development of the property and established trustees to oversee various specified duties. Black Bear Ranch was the subject of the 2005 documentary Commune by Johnathan Berman. The commune still exists today and continues to follow the basic ideals which motivated its founding. At the Summer Solstice Gathering in 2013, there were over 40 residents, the highest population in decades. It is located in a steep pocket valley in the Siskiyou Mountains.  Early life  According to the historian Timothy Miller, the community bought the property for $22,500 using money from a variety of sources including from supporters in the entertainment industry, as well as \\"one large unexpected angelic gift\\" and the \\"proceeds from a major LSD deal\\". The money from the entertainment industry was obtained through what Stephen Holden in The New York Times describes as \\"emotional blackmail\\", quoting Michael Tierra: Although they struggled at first due to a lack of planning,Malcolm Terence, Return to Black Bear, The Journal, Humboldt County California. the community at Black Bear Ranch learned to live self- sufficiently, as the ranch was often snowed in for extended periods during the winter months, and was many hours' drive from the nearest city. The residents managed to gather large quantities of food and medical supplies to see them through the winter and were able to treat a variety of illnesses and medical problems onsite, delivering babies and performing veterinary care. The community homeschooled their children, and maintained tools like chainsaws and cars without a need for mechanics. To raise money to pay for food and supplies, they found work fighting fires in the nearby forests. Members of the commune were key organizers of Ent Forestry, a co-operative which took tree planting and forest rehabilitation contracts with the US Forest Service and Redwoods National Park, and provided income to the commune for several years. Despite their remoteness, the community managed to keep in contact with a variety of radical groups including the Hells Angels and Black Power groups. There was a tension between those with a radical‚Äîeven paramilitary‚Äîpersuasion who wanted to pursue weapons training and possibly harbor radical political fugitives and the many pacifists. One of the founders of the commune, interviewed by the University of Kansas' 60s Commune Project and quoted in Miller: Miller also records how \\"a strong sense of community\\" including ritual peyote use led to a variety of social experiments being conducted including the abolishing of private property and also the institution of a rule to prevent \\"coupling,\\" which banned anyone from sleeping with the same partner for more than two consecutive nights, although this had disastrous consequences after a venereal disease spread amongst the community. Despite the ban on coupling (considered \\"bourgoise decadence\\"), traditional feelings of resentment came back when they tried to work out who had slept with whom in order to treat the disease: At one point, a group called the ShivalilaCommunal ‚Äì After 1960 - Encyclopedia.com \\"Shivalila was founded in Bakersfield, California, in the 1970s by Gridley Lorimer Wright IV (1934-1979).\\" became part of the commune until they were asked to leave by the other members. The New York Sun describes them as a \\"nomadic cult of acid-taking, baby-worshiping hippies looking for the perfect place to bring up children\\" and they were led by a man called Gridley Wright.James Bowman, Trying To Remember the Family Band, New York Sun. Very few rules were ever adopted by the community as Malcolm Terence notes: \\"Anarchists are good at lots of things but making rules isn‚Äôt one of them.\\" After a hepatitis epidemic, they banned sitting on the kitchen counter, and they also banned turning the handle on the cream separator \\"because it used to drive people crazy when people would sit in the kitchen and play with the handle on the cream separator\\".  Life today  Life at the ranch continues on, with similar struggles about what communality means as took place during the early days. The rules have grown into a set of \\"Traditional Guidelines\\" which try to ensure \\"the continued existence of Black Bear Ranch and its tradition of communal living in a way that cares for and nourishes each other and the environment\\".Black Bear Ranch website, Traditional Guidelines Decision making by the group is managed through weekly 'Circles'. In April 2017, the ranch made news when 15-year-old Tennessee student Elizabeth Thomas and her alleged kidnapper and former teacher Tad Cummins were found in a cabin in Cecilville, CA near the ranch after a month- long interstate manhunt. They had stayed for two weeks at Black Bear Ranch but were asked to leave, after which they moved into the cabin.

The film was adapted for the screen by Wendell Mayes and was directed by Otto Preminger. The ensemble cast features Henry Fonda, Charles Laughton, Don Murray, Walter Pidgeon, Peter Lawford, Gene Tierney, Franchot Tone, Lew Ayres, Burgess Meredith, Eddie Hodges, Paul Ford, George Grizzard, Inga Swenson, Betty White and others. The title derives from the United States Constitution's Article II, Sec. 2, cl. 2, which provides that the President of the United States \\"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States\\". The film, set in Washington, D.C., follows the consequences of the nomination of a man with a hidden past for Secretary of State who commits perjury in the course of confirmation proceedings. Plot The President of the United States nominates Robert A. Leffingwell as Secretary of State. The second-term President, who is ill, has chosen him in part because he does not believe that Vice President Harley Hudson, whom both he and others usually ignore, will successfully continue the administration's foreign policy, should he die. Leffingwell's nomination is controversial within the US Senate, which must use its advice and consent powers and approve or reject the appointment. The parties of both the President and the minority are divided. Senate Majority Leader Bob Munson, the senior senator from Michigan, loyally supports the nominee despite his doubts, as do the hard-working Majority Whip Stanley Danta of Connecticut and womanizer Lafe Smith of Rhode Island. Demagogic peace advocate Fred Van Ackerman of Wyoming is especially supportive, but Munson repeatedly advises him not to aggravate the situation. Although also of the majority party, President pro tempore and \\"curmudgeon\\" Seabright \\"Seab\\" Cooley of South Carolina dislikes Leffingwell for both personal and professional reasons and leads the opposition. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee appoints a subcommittee, chaired by majority member Brigham Anderson of Utah, to evaluate the nominee. The young and devoted family man is undecided on Leffingwell. Cooley dramatically introduces a surprise witness, Herbert Gelman, during the subcommittee's hearing. The minor Treasury clerk testifies that he was briefly in a communist cell with Leffingwell and two others at the University of Chicago. Leffingwell denies the charge and effectively questions Gelman's credibility but later tells the President that he had committed perjury and that Gelman was essentially correct. He asks the President to withdraw his nomination, but he refuses. Cooley identifies another member of the cell, senior Treasury official Hardiman Fletcher. He forces Fletcher to confess to Anderson, who tells Munson. Despite personal lobbying by the President, the subcommittee chairman insists for the White House to withdraw the nomination because of Leffingwell's perjury or he will subpoena Fletcher to testify. The President angrily refuses, but the majority leader admits that the White House will soon have to nominate another candidate. Anderson delays his committee's report on Leffingwell, but the President sends Fletcher out of the country, angering the senator. Anderson and his wife receive anonymous phone calls from Van Ackerman's men warning that unless the subcommittee reports favorably on Leffingwell, information about what happened with \\"Ray\\" in Hawaii will appear. A worried Anderson visits a fellow army veteran, Ray Shaff, in New York. Shaff admits that he sold evidence of a past homosexual relationship between the two. Hudson and Anderson's friend, Smith, join others in attempting to counsel the troubled chairman, but unable to reconcile his duty and his secret, Anderson takes his own life. The President denies knowing about the blackmail to Munson and Hudson. He tells the majority leader that he is dying and that Leffingwell's confirmation is vital. Munson criticizes Cooley for opposing the nominee but not exposing Fletcher and thus forcing Anderson to bear the pressure alone. Anderson's death nonetheless permits the subcommittee and the Foreign Relations Committee to proceed with the nomination. Both report favorably to the full Senate. Sen. Seabright Cooley (Charles Laughton) speaking against the Leffingwell nomination on the Senate floor In the Senate Chamber, Cooley apologizes for his \\"vindictiveness.\\" While he will vote against Leffingwell and his \\"alien voice,\\" the senator will not ask others to follow. Munson, moved by Cooley's action, cites the \\"tragic circumstances\\" surrounding the confirmation. The majority leader will vote for Leffingwell but will permit a conscience vote from others. Hudson's quorum call and the majority leader's refusal to yield the floor prevent Van Ackerman from speaking until Munson asks for the \\"yeas and nays,\\" ending debate. The majority leader tells Van Ackerman that but for the Andersons' privacy, the Senate would have censured and expelled him. Van Ackerman leaves the chamber before the vote. Munson's side is slightly ahead until Smith unexpectedly votes against Leffingwell, and the majority leader prepares for the Vice President to break the tie in the nominee's favor. Secret Service agents enter the chamber, and Hudson receives a message from the Senate Chaplain. He announces that he will not break the tie, thus causing the nomination to fail, and that the President has died during the vote. As he leaves with the Secret Service, Hudson tells Munson that he wants to choose his own Secretary of State. The film ends as Munson makes a motion to adjourn because of the former president's death. Cast * Henry Fonda as Robert A.

Production Preminger offered Martin Luther King Jr. a cameo role as a U.S. Senator from Georgia, although there were no serving African-American senators at the time. King reportedly gave the offer serious consideration but eventually turned it down, feeling that it might cause hostility and hurt the civil rights movement. Former Vice President Richard Nixon was offered the role of the Vice President, but refused and pointed out some \\"glaring and obvious\\" errors in the script, presumably including the critical fact that under Article II of the U.S. Constitution, the Vice President automatically assumes the office of the president upon the president's death, and would not have been able to cast a tie-breaking vote as Vice President even if he had wished to.Alan Schroeder, Celebrity-in-Chief, p. 293 Advise & Consent was one of a sequence of Preminger films that challenged both the Motion Picture Association of America's Production Code and the Hollywood blacklist. It pushed censorship boundaries with its depiction of a married senator who is being blackmailed over a wartime homosexual affair, and was the first mainstream American movie after World War II to show a gay bar. Preminger confronted the blacklist by casting known left-wing actors Geer and Meredith. Fonda's character Leffingwell was seen as drawing particularly on real-life State Department official (and Soviet spy) Alger Hiss. The film marked a screen comeback for Gene Tierney, whose breakthrough to major stardom came in Preminger's 1944 film Laura. Tierney had withdrawn from acting for several years because of her ongoing struggle with bipolar disorder. Advise & Consent was the last of four films she made for Preminger and one of her last major film roles. Advise & Consent was Laughton's last film; he was suffering from cancer during filming, and died six months after the film's release. Lawford was John F. Kennedy's brother-in-law when the story was filmed. He plays Lafe Smith, identified as a senator from Rhode Island (and modeled on Kennedy), although in Drury's book the character represents Iowa. White made her film debut in Advise & Consent, appearing in one scene as a young senator from Kansas. Many scenes were filmed at real locations in Washington D.C., including the Capitol, the canteen of the Treasury Building, the Washington Monument and the Crystal Room of the Sheraton Carlton Hotel. Critical reception The staff of Variety liked the acting but believed the screenplay was problematic. They wrote, \\"As interpreted by producer-director Otto Preminger and scripter Wendell Mayes, Advise and Consent is intermittently well dialogued and too talky, and, strangely, arrested in its development and illogical... Preminger has endowed his production with wholly capable performers... The characterizations come through with fine clarity.\\" The film critic for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther, did not like the storyline of the script, writing, \\"Without even giving the appearance of trying to be accurate and fair about the existence of a reasonable balance of good men and rogues in government, Mr. Preminger and Wendell Mayes, his writer, taking their cue from Mr. Drury's book, have loaded their drama with rascals to show the types in Washington.\\" Crowther also was bothered by the use of the homosexual affair. He wrote, \\"It is in this latter complication that the nature of the drama is finally exposed for the deliberately scandalous, sensational and caustic thing it is. Mr. Preminger has his character go through a lurid and seamy encounter with his old friend before cutting his throat, an act that seems unrealistic, except as a splashy high point for the film.\\" The Academy Film Archive preserved Advise & Consent in 2007.

Family Law was Argentina official submission for the 2004 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film Plot The film tells the story of Ariel Perelman (Daniel Hendler). While he has an easygoing lifestyle, he's trying to find his way in life in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He works at a university as a law professor. The film begins with a long narration of the way things stand in his life. He describes his father, Bernardo Perelman (Arturo Goetz), in detail. Perelman, as he's known, is a popular public defender who meets his clients where they work or in restaurants so he can determine what they are \\"all about.\\" Most of his clients are generally poor. He's very close to his secretary (Adriana Aizemberg) since his wife died fifteen years ago. Work fills Perelman's days, and Ariel is astonished by his energy. After lusting after Sandra (Julieta D√≠az), an attractive woman who takes his class, Ariel decides to chase her and takes the Pilates class she teaches. Not much happens until Sandra is sued for teaching Pilates without the approval of the company who hold the rights to teach Pilates in Argentina. Ariel (known as Perelman to Sandra) reaches out to his father for help and wins the law suit. In the process, Sandra falls in love with the younger Perelman and they marry. She begins to decorate their home for a few years and they have a child they name Gast√≥n (Eloy Burman), who is a quite charming young boy. Ariel's university building is shut down for a month because it had collapsed, and he is given some time off. However, he doesn't share this news with his wife. During this time his father starts spending some quality time with Ariel, which makes him think something must be wrong. Ariel is asked by the Swiss kindergarten school Gast√≥n attends to participate in a play and swim classes with the other fathers. Ariel first rebels but gives in. The film ends with his father's death and burial and a long introspective look at Ariel Perelman's life in his 30s.

You get the sense from her radiance that the secretary has always had a thing for her boss. His wife's death allowed her to finally express it physically, and she's overjoyed by their intimacy...Ultimately this is a movie about a son's discovery of the man he knows mostly as a father.

We have cellular telephones and pagers, yet we spend very little time in deep conversation with those in our immediate family.

The two major influencing shows within the Artists' Studio's early years were in stark contrast to each other.

It also offers a wide variety of classes in dancing, acting and singing. It also hosts other unique services, such as hosting themed children's birthday parties. The extra services are likely more a reflection on the fact that, unlike most community theatres in Indiana, The Artists' Studio is a for-profit organization. This has kept the Encore Association, which provides an award ceremony for community theatres in Indiana, from recognizing any of The Artists' Studios productions, as one of the stipulations is that no one be paid in a nominated production; it must be produced by a not-for-profit theatre group.Who is missing from the [Encore Award] nominations...

McGinnis. Carter Brown was the literary pseudonym of Alan Geoffrey Yates (1 August 19235 May 1985), an English-born Australian writer of detective fiction. Career Born in England, Alan Yates married and settled in Australia in 1948. He began his working life as a film technician, a salesman and in public relations for Qantas before taking up writing full- time. Yates soon became a literary phenomenon. He wrote westerns under the pseudonym Todd Conway, and science fiction under Paul Valdez. He even found the time to write books under various versions of his own name as well as other pseudonyms, Dennis Sinclair and Sinclair MacKellar. But it was his pseudonym Peter Carter Brown then later, Carter Brown ('Peter' was dropped for the US market) who was to become the international best-selling pulp fiction author. The extraordinary early success of Carter Brown in the 1950s meant that Yates was contracted to produce one short novel and two long novels each month. In reality, Yates was truly prolific with 322 published Carter Brown novels, including multiple series variously featuring protagonists Mike Farrell, Andy Kane, Mavis Seidlitz, Lt. Al Wheeler, Rick Holman, Danny Boyd, Larry Baker, Zelda Roxanne, et al. Yet despite the enormity of his output, a 1963 profile in Pix magazine revealed he approached deadlines 'with the reluctance of a long-distance swimmer shivering on the brink of a cold, grey English Channel. In the manic depressive moments of the third night without sleep ‚Äì when the deadline is long past and the mental block has set solid as concrete, the writer inevitably descends into self-analysis. He knows, of course, that it will be no more help than the last Dexedrine tablet but still clings to the na√Øve hope that, somehow, sometime, he will find a way of avoiding the recurrence of his present hopeless situation.‚Äô His books, originally published by Horwitz and Signet, were set in the United States and published throughout the anglophone world. In its obituary for Yates in 1985, The New York Times noted that he had written \\"some 30 detective novels with American backgrounds before ever having visited the United States ... He said he chose American settings because Australians preferred them.\\" A rumour spread at the height of his popularity that Yates was one of John F. Kennedy's favourite authors ‚Äì a rumour which helped propel his sales even further in the North American market. The novels were also popular in Europe where they were translated into French, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Russian, Finnish, German, Portuguese, Romanian, Dutch. In Asia, some of the novels were translated into Thai and Japanese. Carter Brown's huge international success saw reportedly 120 million books in print, second only to The Bible in terms of the number of languages into which they were translated. The success of the books also spawned a comic book series, the 'Carter Brown Murder Mystery Hour' on radio, three French films, a Japanese TV series, and a French literary award for 'The most whiskies drunk in a single novel'. In the early 1980s, Yates and Richard O'Brien of The Rocky Horror Show fame wrote a musical of The Stripper, described in classic Carter Brown terminology as 'the girl who says it all from the neck down'. Yates died of a heart attack in 1985 in Sydney. In 1997, he was posthumously awarded a Ned Kelly, Australia's leading literary award for crime writing, for his lifelong contribution to the art. C. J. McKenzie C. J. McKenzie, an editor for Horwitz, was commissioned to write ten of the Carter Brown novels while Yates was overseas in 1958.

The genus was first described in 1895 by Samuel Hubbard Scudder, based on observations of the species Timema californicum. Compared to other stick insects (order Phasmatodea), the genus Timema is considered basal; that is, the earliest \\"branch\\" to diverge from the phylogenetic tree that includes all Phasmatodea. To emphasize this outgroup status, all stick insects not included in Timema are sometimes described as \\"Euphasmatodea.\\" Five of the twenty-one species of Timema are parthenogenetic, including two species that have not engaged in sexual reproduction for one million years, the longest known asexual period for any insect. Description Timema poppense camouflaged on its host, Sequoia sempervirens (Redwood) Timema spp. differ from other Phasmatodea in that their tarsi have three segments rather than five. For stick insects, they have relatively small, stout bodies, so that they look somewhat like earwigs (order Dermaptera). =Cryptic coloration and camouflage= Timema walking sticks are night-feeders who spend daytime resting on the leaves or bark of the plants they feed on. Timema colors (primarily green, gray, or brown) and patterns (which may be stripes, scales, or dots) match their typical background, a form of crypsis. In 2008, researchers studying the presence or absence of a dorsal stripe suggested that it has independently evolved several times in Timema species and is an adaptation for crypsis on needle-like leaves. All of the eight Timema species with a dorsal stripe have at least one host plant with needle-like foliage. Of the thirteen unstriped species, seven feed only on broadleaf plants. Four (T. ritense, T. podura, T. genevievae, and T. coffmani) rest during the day on the host plant's trunk rather than its leaves and have bodies that are brown, gray, or tan. Only two species (T. nakipa and T. boharti) have green unstriped morphs that feed on needle-like foliage; both are generalist feeders that also feed on broadleaf hosts. The species Timema cristinae exhibits both striped and unstriped populations depending on the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation to blend in with the needle-like leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs. These characteristics are genetically inherited and has been interpreted as the early stages of the speciation process. The two ecotypes will eventually become separate species once reproductive isolation is achieved. At the moment, both ecotypes are still capable of interbreeding and producing viable offspring, as such they are still considered a single species. =Life cycle and reproduction= Timema eggs are soft, ellipsoidal, and about two mm long, with a lid-like structure at one end (the operculum) through which the nymph will emerge. Timema females use particles of dirt, which they have previously ingested, to coat their eggs. The eggs of many stick insects, including Timema, are attractive to ants, who carry them away to their burrows to feed on the egg's capitulum, while leaving the rest of the egg intact to hatch. The emerging nymph passes through six or seven instars before reaching adulthood. Timema males, in sexual species of Timema, show a consistent pattern of courting behavior. The male climbs onto the back of the female and, after a short display of vibrating and waving, they proceed to mate. (Rejection by the female is possible but uncommon.) The male then rides on the female's back for up to five days, a behavior often referred to as \\"guarding\\" the female. Several species of Timema are parthenogenetic: that is, females can reproduce asexually, producing viable eggs without male participation. According to Tanja Schwander, \\"Timema are indeed the oldest insects for which there is good evidence that they have been asexual for long periods of time.\\" She heads a team of researchers who found that five Timema species (T. douglasi, T. monikense, T. shepardi, T. tahoe and T. genevievae) have used only asexual reproduction for more than 500,000 years, with T. tahoe and T. genevievae reproducing asexually for over one million years. Habitat Santa Lucia Mountains of California. The geographic range of Timema is limited to mountainous regions of western North America between 30¬∞ and 42¬∞ N. They are found primarily in California, as well as in a few other neighboring states (Oregon, Nevada, Arizona) and in northern Mexico. All are herbivores, primarily feeding on host plants found in chaparral. Host plants of the different Timema species include Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas fir), Sequoia sempervirens (Californian redwood), Arctostaphylos spp. (manzanita), Ceanothus spp., Adenostoma fasciculatum (chamise), Abies concolor (white fir), Quercus spp. (oak), Heteromeles arbutifolia (toyon), Cercocarpus spp. (mountain- mahogany), Eriogonum sp. (buckwheat), and Juniperus spp. (juniper). Phylogeny General phylogenetic relationships within Timema (Law & Crespi, 2002). Species marked with ‚ôÄ are parthenogenetic (female only). Classification Timema is the only member of the family Timematidae and the suborder Timematodea. Their clade is considered basal to the order Phasmatodea; that is, many scientists believe that Timema-type stick insects represent the earliest \\"branch\\" to diverge from the phylogenetic tree that gave rise to all the stick insects of Phasmatodea. This primal distinction is referenced by the name \\"Euphasmatodea\\", which is given to all the clades of Phasmatodea other than the suborder Timematodea. Twenty-one species have been described; in addition there are at least two undescribed species known to exist: * Timema bartmani * Timema boharti * Timema californicum * Timema chumash * Timema coffmani * Timema cristinae * Timema dorotheae * Timema douglasi * Timema genevievae * Timema knulli * Timema landelsense * Timema monikense * Timema morongense * Timema nakipa * Timema nevadense * Timema petita * Timema podura * Timema poppense * Timema ritense * Timema shepardi * Timema tahoe * Timema sp. nov. on limber pine * Timema sp. nov. on Sargent cypress See also *Thelytoky *Sexual dimorphism *Evolutionary arms race *Sexual conflict References External links *List of species of Timema *Timema Discovery Project *Adineta ricciae Phasmatodea genera Taxa named by Samuel Hubbard Scudder ","title":"Timema"},{"id":"9701502","text":"The Alaskan Hotel and Bar, also known as the Northlander Hotel and The Alaskan, is a historic establishment and the oldest operating hotel in Juneau, Alaska.

History Standing at the confluence of the River Irwell and River Croal the site was used around 1850-70 as a tip for toxic alkaline waste from the production of sodium carbonate (soda ash) by the Leblanc process. The waste, known as 'galligu', was a blue sludge (from reduced iron compounds) dominated by calcium sulphide and smelling of bad eggs. The surface of the waste has since weathered down to calcium carbonate, and calcicolous vegetation has colonised the site. As natural limestone grassland does not occur in Greater Manchester, many of the species found are rare in the county. The 8.8 hectare (21.7 acres)site became a SSSI in 1988, and a Local Nature Reserve in 2000. In 1936 a major breach in the now defunct Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal occurred east of the Nob End locks; it has never been repaired.Pennine Waterways Habitats There are a number of different habitats on the site, the creation of which were dependent upon: the type of waste deposited, the pattern of deposition and the nature of the underlying substrate: * Open, species rich, calcicolous grassland. * Fescue grassland with salix scrub. * Wet areas with rushes, marsh plants and salix scrub * neutral grasslands. * Acid grasslands.

Pharmacology  Raxibacumab injection is a monoclonal antibody targeting the protective antigen (PA) component of the lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis.  Development history  Raxibacumab was developed by Human Genome Sciences (HGS) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under contract number HHS010020050006C. At the 2 November 2012 meeting of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) members \\"voted 16 to 1 in support of the clinical benefit of raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax, with one abstention. In addition, the committee voted 18 ‚Äì 0 in favour of the risk-benefit profile of raxibacumab\\". In 2009, support from the FDA was denied after it \\"expressed doubt on the agent's added benefit over the antibiotic levofloxacin (Levaquin) alone\\". On Dec. 14, 2012, FDA approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax, a form of the infectious disease caused by breathing in the spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Raxibacumab also is approved to prevent inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate.

It runs for from an interchange with U.S. Route 12 (US 12) and through the city of Selah to a junction with SR 821\\\\. A portion of the highway runs in the median of Interstate 82 (I-82), its parent route, as it crosses the Naches River. SR 823 was established by the state government in 1984, running from I-82 to downtown Selah. It replaced earlier city and county roads built in the late 19th century and rebuilt several times in the early 20th century alongside an interurban railway. The north half of the route was built by the county in the 1970s and added to SR 823 in 1991. The section through downtown Selah was later rerouted onto a truck bypass built by the state in 2011, eliminating an extra turn in the route. Route description Looking northbound on SR 823 in Selah SR 823 begins as a continuation of North 1st Street at an interchange with US 12 north of downtown Yakima. The two-lane highway runs northwest in the freeway median of I-82 and US 97 through the Selah Gap, crossing the Naches River and the Yakima River near the confluence of the rivers. On the north side of an interchange with Resthaven Road, which provides connections between the freeway and SR 823, the highway crosses over the eastbound lanes of I-82. The highway crosses again over the Yakima River on a four-lane bridge that also includes a multi-use bicycle and pedestrian path on the west side. SR 823 intersects a road serving the River Ridge Golf Course and crosses over a section of the BNSF Railway's Yakima River Subdivision railroad before entering Selah as 1st Street. The street follows a section of the Yakima Valley Transportation Company's heritage streetcar route and passes through a commercial district with several warehouses. At Valleyview Avenue, SR 823 turns east and becomes Jim Clements Way, which turns north onto Wenas Avenue. After intersecting Naches Avenue, Wenas Avenue turns northeast and heads through a commercial and suburban area on the east edge of Carlon Park before leaving the city. SR 823 leaves Wenas Road near a group of warehouses and travels northeast along Harrison Road to a railroad overpass and another bridge across the Yakima River. To the east end of the bridge, the highway reaches its terminus at a junction with SR 821, which continues north into the Yakima River Canyon and southeast to an interchange with I-82 near the Yakima Training Center. SR 823 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on the state's highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. The highway's 2016 traffic volumes ranged from a minimum of 4,500 vehicles at its northern terminus with SR 821 to a maximum of 31,000 vehicles between Yakima and Selah. SR 823 also has a high volume of freight traffic, carrying fruit from the greater Yakima Valley to processing plants in Selah, and is designated as a Strategic Freight Corridor by the state government. A section of SR 823 between US 12 in Yakima and Naches Avenue in downtown Selah is listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. History Looking westbound on I-82 at its interchange with SR 823 in southern Selah The road connecting the Selah Valley to Yakima was built along the west side of the Yakima River by the end of the 19th century, following a section of the Northern Pacific Railway. An interurban railway operated by the Yakima Valley Transportation Company was constructed along the side of the road in 1913. It was shut down in 1935, but was later revived as a seasonal heritage service. The original road was replaced in 1912 by a route on the east side of the river, which was later paved and signed as part of the Inland Empire Highway and Yellowstone Trail. Both named highways were moved to the newly built Canyon Road in 1924. I-82 was constructed to the east of Selah in 1970, replacing the old highway through the Selah Gap and including two interchanges at Selah Road and Firing Center Road. Selah Road had been rebuilt in 1947 with wider bridges over the Yakima River and railroad, while the north end lacked a direct connection to Selah until the construction of Harrison Road in the early 1970s. The southernmost section of the road, running between I-82 and Fasset Avenue in Selah, was added to the state highway system in 1984 and were designated as part of SR 823. The state legislature also included a clause to withhold improvements to the highway unless a mix of state, county, and city funds were obtained. In 1991, SR 823 was extended north by the legislature through Selah and to a junction with SR 821 near the Firing Center Road interchange. In June 1997, WSDOT began construction on a $24 million project (equivalent to $ in dollars) to rebuild the I-82 interchange and connect SR 823 to US 12 and North 1st Street in northern Yakima. The new interchange and bridges across the Yakima and Naches rivers were completed in December 1998, extending SR 823 by . The state legislature allocated $9.3 million from its new gas tax in 2005 to build a truck bypass of downtown Selah that would be incorporated into SR 823. The bypass was constructed as an extension of South Wenas Avenue and eliminated a pair of sharp turns to and from a one-block section of Naches Avenue. Construction was delayed from spring 2010 to the following year and was completed on August 1, 2011, during a dedication ceremony that named the bypass for legislator Jim Clements, who lobbied for its inclusion in the 2005 budget. The bypass took a third of the 30,000 vehicles that passed through downtown Selah on a daily basis; SR 823 remains the only means of accessing Selah, but plans to build a third interchange on I-82 were considered by the city government in the late 2010s.

Strahov Monastery () is a Premonstratensian abbey founded in 1143 by Jind≈ôich Zd√≠k, Bishop John of Prague, and Vladislaus II, Duke of Bohemia. It is located in Strahov, Prague, Czech Republic. History =The founding of a monastery= Library of Strahov Monastery After his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1138, the bishop of Olomouc, Jind≈ôich Zd√≠k, took hold of the idea of founding a monastery of regular canons in Prague. He had the support of the bishops of Prague and Sobƒõslav I, Duke of Bohemia and‚Äîafter his death‚ÄîVladislav II. After Zd√≠k's first unsuccessful attempt to found a Czech variant of the canons' order at the place called Strahov in 1140, an invitation was issued to the Premonstratensians, whose first representatives arrived from Steinfeld in the Rhine valley (now Germany). The monks began to build their monastery first of wood, with a Romanesque basilica as the center of all spiritual events in Strahov. The building was gradually completed and the construction of the monastery stone buildings continued, in order to replace the provisional wooden living quarters with permanent stone. In 1258, the monastery was heavily damaged by fire and later renewed. =During the Hussite Wars= The monastery continued functioning until the period of the Hussites, when it was attacked and plundered by the citizens of Prague in 1420. Books, articles of worship, and the furnishings of both church and convent were burned. Although the building did not sustain great damage from an architectural viewpoint, the monastery took a long time to recover. During the Hussite Wars, the years of the reign of George of Podƒõbrady, and the time up to the end of the 16th century, Strahov was relatively moribund. Attempts were made by various officials to renew the original monastery and its religious life, but they were unsuccessful. It was not until the arrival of the abbot Jan Lohelius that a turn came about. This cleric, originally of Tepl√° Abbey, became the abbot of Strahov in 1586 and all his abilities were devoted to the renewal of Strahov. He tried to raise the spiritual life of the monastery and, as a visitator circarie of the Premonstratensian order as a whole in Bohemia, he also devoted attention to the material aspect of things. He reconstructed the church, renewed the abbey buildings, established workshops, built a new dormitory and refectory, and had the monastery gardens newly laid out. He regained many of the monastery estates in order to build up the material base of the monastery, providing funds for the institution's maintenance and further development. Thanks to his untiring activity, by 1594‚Äîonly eight years after Lohelius's appointment‚Äîa twelve-member community of monks could live in the monastery once more. =During the Thirty Years' War= Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady is the main cloister church In 1612 Jan Lohelius became the archbishop of Prague, his work at Strahov then being continued by the new abbot, Ka≈°par Questenberg. He continued in the expensive work started by Lohelius, completed the lower cloisters and prelature, and even erected a new building in the form of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, as well as adding out- buildings and a brewery. Furthermore, he founded the Norbertine seminary in the New Town, which was intended for the theological studies of members of the order. All this was achieved during the Thirty Years' War, when Ka≈°par Questenberg himself was forced by the violence to flee from Prague. The financial account of the costs incurred by his building activities amounted to about 100,000 tolars, which at that time was a very respectable sum for any building work. In this respect, Ka≈°par Questenberg's expenditures were comparable with such builders as his contemporary Albrecht von Wallenstein. One of the biggest events in the history of the Premonstratensian order was the transfer of the remains of Norbert of Xanten, the founder of the order, from Magdeburg. The reinterring took place under Questenberg's abbacy. This came about in 1627, and since then the remains of the saintly founder have laid at rest in the abbey church. During Questenberg's time, the Church of Saint Roch was also completed. Originally it was a votive church whose construction was started by Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1602 as an expression of thanks for the end of the plague in 1599. After numerous changes of fortune the church was completed, including its interior, by 1630. When Ka≈°par Questenberg died in 1640 his successor was Kry≈°pin Fuk, who continued in his work. Moreover, he gained renown for himself through his participation in the making of the Vltava navigable in the sector called St John's Rapids (Svatoj√°nsk√© proudy). During this period the abbey was plundered by troops of the Swedish Empire towards the end of the Thirty Years' War. The church and the library were looted. After the departure of the Swedes, Kry≈°pin Fuk had the damaged abbey repaired again, his work being continued by the Abbots Ameluxen, Sutor, and Franck. The last-mentioned had the prelature reconstructed and a new St. Elizabeth's Hospital built, because the original one built by Ka≈°par Questenberg was demolished during the construction of Baroque fortifications in Prague. =The Theological Hall= The Theological Hall with stucco decoration and paintings from 1720s In 1670 Jeron√Ωm Hirnheim, a philosopher and theologian, became the abbot of Strahov. His greatest work, which has survived to the present day, was the building of a new library in the so-called Theological Hall (Teologick√Ω s√°l), completed in 1679. During the 17th and early 18th centuries, other abbots continued in the reconstruction of the monastery. They also cared for the church, which was repaired and decorated several times during the given period. The monastery experienced other significant building activity, namely after the assaults of French and Bavarian troops in 1742, when Prague was bombarded and seriously damaged. The abbot then organized building efforts anew, in the course of which the church was rebuilt along with the monastery area. After 1950, the library was incorporated into the Memorial of National Literature. Following events of 1989 the library was, along with the monastery, returned to the Premonstratensians.Humphreys, R., The Rough Guide to Prague (London: Rough Guides, 2002), p. 58. Within the library, a reading room is also open. The Strahov Library contains over 200,000 volumes, including over 3,000 manuscripts and 1,500 first prints stored in a special depository. =The Philosophical Hall= The Philosophical Hall, built for the books coming from the southern Moravian Louka Convent (abolished in 1784) In 1779 V√°clav Mayer occupied the abbot's throne and was the last to carry out great building activities. His most outstanding work was the building of the new library,Mary-Ann Gallagher, Matthew Gardner, Sadakat Kadri, Vienna Prague Budapest, 2nd, pg. 156, Cadogan Guides (2007), now in Classical style. Today it is called the Philosophical Hall (Filosofick√Ω s√°l). This work brought the extensive building activity at Strahov Monastery to an end and the following generations of abbots devoted their attention merely to minor architectural repairs, all under the influence of contemporary fashion, and to maintenance of the area as a whole. The monastery survived in this way until 1950, when it was taken over by the communist regime, the religious being interned and placed in civil employment, very few of them being able to work in the clerical administration as priests of the diocese. The monastery was subjected to thorough archeological research and transformed into the Memorial of National Literature. In the course of the said archeological research the long since forgotten Romanesque form of the monastery was revealed and reconstructed in a sensitive way. =After the Velvet Revolution= After the fall of the communist regime in 1989, the monastery was returned to the Premonstratensian Order, which began to realize a costly reconstruction of the building. By 1994 the church had been restored, a new technical network constructed, the Strahov picture gallery newly built, and the Strahov library renewed. Other architectural restorations were also carried out.

It was independently developed by the botanists Thorvald S√∏rensen and Lee Raymond Dice, who published in 1948 and 1945 respectively. Name The index is known by several other names, especially S√∏rensen‚ÄìDice index, S√∏rensen index and Dice's coefficient. Other variations include the \\"similarity coefficient\\" or \\"index\\", such as Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Common alternate spellings for S√∏rensen are Sorenson, Soerenson and S√∂renson, and all three can also be seen with the ‚Äìsen ending. Other names include: * F1 score * Czekanowski's binary (non- quantitative) index * Measure of genetic similarity * Zijdenbos similarity index, referring to a 1994 paper of Zijdenbos et al. Formula S√∏rensen's original formula was intended to be applied to discrete data. Given two sets, X and Y, it is defined as : DSC = \\\\frac{2 X \\\\cap Y}{X + Y} where X and Y are the cardinalities of the two sets (i.e. the number of elements in each set). The S√∏rensen index equals twice the number of elements common to both sets divided by the sum of the number of elements in each set. When applied to Boolean data, using the definition of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN), it can be written as : DSC = \\\\frac{2 TP}{2 TP + FP + FN}. It is different from the Jaccard index which only counts true positives once in both the numerator and denominator. DSC is the quotient of similarity and ranges between 0 and 1.http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anbf40/anbf40-415.pdf It can be viewed as a similarity measure over sets. Similarly to the Jaccard index, the set operations can be expressed in terms of vector operations over binary vectors a and b: :s_v = \\\\frac{2  \\\\bf{a} \\\\cdot \\\\bf{b} }{ \\\\bf{a} ^2 +  \\\\bf{b} ^2} which gives the same outcome over binary vectors and also gives a more general similarity metric over vectors in general terms. For sets X and Y of keywords used in information retrieval, the coefficient may be defined as twice the shared information (intersection) over the sum of cardinalities : When taken as a string similarity measure, the coefficient may be calculated for two strings, x and y using bigrams as follows: :s = \\\\frac{2 n_t}{n_x + n_y} where nt is the number of character bigrams found in both strings, nx is the number of bigrams in string x and ny is the number of bigrams in string y. For example, to calculate the similarity between: :\`night\` :\`nacht\` We would find the set of bigrams in each word: :{\`ni\`,\`ig\`,\`gh\`,\`ht\`} :{\`na\`,\`ac\`,\`ch\`,\`ht\`} Each set has four elements, and the intersection of these two sets has only one element: \`ht\`. Inserting these numbers into the formula, we calculate, s = (2 ¬∑ 1) / (4 + 4) = 0.25. Difference from Jaccard  This coefficient is not very different in form from the Jaccard index. In fact, both are equivalent in the sense that given a value for the S√∏rensen‚ÄìDice coefficient S, one can calculate the respective Jaccard index value J and vice versa, using the equations J=S/(2-S) and S=2J/(1+J). Since the S√∏rensen‚ÄìDice coefficient does not satisfy the triangle inequality, it can be considered a semimetric version of the Jaccard index. The function ranges between zero and one, like Jaccard. Unlike Jaccard, the corresponding difference function :d = 1 - \\\\frac{2  X \\\\cap Y }{ X  +  Y } is not a proper distance metric as it does not satisfy the triangle inequality.Gallagher, E.D., 1999. COMPAH Documentation, University of Massachusetts, Boston The simplest counterexample of this is given by the three sets {a}, {b}, and {a,b}, the distance between the first two being 1, and the difference between the third and each of the others being one-third. To satisfy the triangle inequality, the sum of any two of these three sides must be greater than or equal to the remaining side. However, the distance between {a} and {a,b} plus the distance between {b} and {a,b} equals 2/3 and is therefore less than the distance between {a} and {b} which is 1. Applications The S√∏rensen‚ÄìDice coefficient is useful for ecological community data (e.g. Looman & Campbell, 1960). Justification for its use is primarily empirical rather than theoretical (although it can be justified theoretically as the intersection of two fuzzy sets). As compared to Euclidean distance, the S√∏rensen distance retains sensitivity in more heterogeneous data sets and gives less weight to outliers.McCune, Bruce & Grace, James (2002) Analysis of Ecological Communities. Mjm Software Design; . Recently the Dice score (and its variations, e.g. logDice taking a logarithm of it) has become popular in computer lexicography for measuring the lexical association score of two given words.Rychl√Ω, P.

They had a sound similar to 16 Volt and Chemlab, integrating synthesizers and vocal samples with more traditional rock instruments. The band's full-length debut Diatribe was released by Cargo Music and Re-Constriction Records on November 3, 1996. History Diatribe was formed in San Jose, California, by vocalist/keyboardist Marc Jameson, bassist Kevin Marburg and guitarists Vince Montalbano and Pat Toves. They recorded \\"Cockeyed Motherfucker\\" in 1990 and released the song on two various artists compilations, A Reason for Living by Santa Cruz Skateboards and From the Machine by Index Productions. The band debuted with the EP Therapy for Eight One Nine Productions. The EP's title track was later used in the 1995 film Strange Days but did not appear on the official soundtrack album. The music came to the attention of Christian Petke, vocalist and founding member of Deathline International, who decided to reissue Diatribe's debut and utilize them with Battery as premier band's for his label COP International. Diatribe came to attention of Re-Constriction Records owner Chase, who adopted the band onto his roster and released Nothing in 1992. The EP contained the songs \\"Kingpin\\" and \\"Nothing\\", which became staples for the band. Guitarist Montalbano parted ways with the band after the Nothing's release and his position was filled by Phil Biagini. In 1994 the band fell under the management of Lawrence Christopher and participated with KMFDM and Sister Machine Gun at Angst Fest, where they premiered the song \\"Sick the Dogs\\". The band began incorporating electronic music into their guitar oriented sound. The band finished recording a demo in 1995, which included the songs \\"Another Time\\", \\"Freaks\\", \\"New Breed\\", \\"The Son\\", \\"Web\\" and \\"World on Fire\\". The following year they released Diatribe for Re-Constriction Records. The band released the single Ultracide with \\"Junkyard\\" as a B-side. With Marc Jameson having his interests diverted to breakbeat, drum and bass, downtempo and trip hop, the Diatribe's artistic direction splintered and they decided to disband.

The museum was owned by famous showman P. T. Barnum, who purchased Scudder's American Museum in 1841. The museum offered both strange and educational attractions and performances. History In 1841 Barnum acquired the building and natural history collection of Scudder's American Museum for less than half of its appraised value with the financial support of Francis Olmsted, by quickly purchasing it the day after the soon to be buyers, the Peale Museum Company, failed to make their payment. He converted the five- story exterior into an advertisement lit with limelight. The museum opened on January 1, 1842. Its attractions made it a combination zoo, museum, lecture hall, wax museum, theater and freak show, in what was, at the same time, a central site in the development of American popular culture. Barnum filled the American Museum with dioramas, panoramas, \\"cosmoramas\\", scientific instruments, modern appliances, a flea circus, a loom powered by a dog, the trunk of a tree under which Jesus‚Äô disciples sat, an oyster bar, a rifle range, waxworks, glass blowers, taxidermists, phrenologists, pretty baby contests, Ned the learned seal, the Feejee Mermaid (a mummified monkey's torso with a fish's tail), midgets, Chang and Eng the Siamese twins, a menagerie of exotic animals that included beluga whales in an aquarium, giants, Native Americans who performed traditional songs and dances, Grizzly Adams's trained bears and performances ranging from magicians, ventriloquists and blackface minstrels to adaptations of biblical tales and Uncle Tom's Cabin. At its peak, the museum was open fifteen hours a day and had as many as 15,000 visitors a day. Some 38 million customers paid the 25 cents admission to visit the museum between 1841 and 1865. The total population of the United States in 1860 was under 32 million. In November 1864 the Confederate Army of Manhattan attempted and failed to burn down the museum, but on July 13, 1865 the American Museum burned to the ground in one of the most spectacular fires New York has ever seen. Animals at the museum were seen jumping from the burning building, only to be shot by police. Many of the animals unable to escape the blaze burned to death in their enclosures, including the two beluga whales who boiled to death in their tanks. It was allegedly during this fire that a fireman by the name of Johnny Denham killed an escaped tiger with his ax before rushing into the burning building and carrying out a 400-pound woman on his shoulders. Barnum's New Museum opened September 6, 1865, at 539-41 Broadway, between Spring and Prince Streets, but that also burned down, on March 3, 1868. It was after this that Barnum moved on to politics and the circus industry. Barnum's American Museum was one of the most popular attractions of its time. The site at Ann Street was then used for a new building for the New York Herald newspaper. In July 2000 a virtual museum version opened on the Internet, supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  Advertisement  One of the biggest attractions and advantages to the success of the American Museum was Barnum's advertising strategy. Barnum's self-professed goal was \\"to make the Museum the town wonder and talk of the town.\\" To do this he was \\"not above exploiting his patrons' ignorance and credulity from time to time,\\" as seen in some of his most well-known schemes: the Fejee mermaid, the Little Woolly horse, and the 'to the egress' signs. Not only did Barnum capitalize on the draw of some of his most famous attractions, he would often publish articles in newspapers claiming that his exhibits were fake, which in turn caused audiences to return to see them for themselves. He also printed off countless massive colored posters displaying the many exhibits within the museum. These posters often exaggerated the attractions they advertised, but this did not stop visitors from returning after finding out they had been misled. The poster for the Fejee mermaid was so massive, that it covered a majority of the front of the museum. Attractions The Lecture Room of Barnum's American Museum, 1853. The museum's collection included items collected throughout the world over a period of 25 years. The museum offered many attractions which grew to great fame. One of the most famous was General Tom Thumb a 25-inch tall dwarf who eventually garnered so much fame and success that Queen Victoria saw his performances twice and Abraham Lincoln personally congratulated Thumb on his wedding. Thumb wasn't the only physical oddity there; there was also the Fiji Mermaid and Josephine Boisdechene, who had a large beard, which had grown to the length of two inches when she was only eight years old. As if to supplement Tom Thumb, another famous attraction of the museum was William Henry Johnson, who was one of Barnum's longest- running attractions. Another one of the famous attractions at the museum were Chang and Eng, Siamese twins who were extremely argumentative, both with each other and Barnum himself. The museum also boasted an elegant theatre, called the \\"Lecture Room,\\" and characterized in the popular Gleason's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion of 1853, \\"one of the most elegant and recherche halls of its class to be found anywhere,\\" which would offer \\"every species of entertainment ... 'from grave to gay, from lively to severe,' ... [and] judiciously purged of every semblance of immorality.\\" Impressively, these shows \\"[rivaled] or even [excelled] those of the neighboring theaters.\\" It was possible for these shows to do this because: 1) these performances occurred in a space labeled a lecture hall, helping to distinguish them for those who would never have been near a theatre, and 2) \\"[Barnum] made the theatre into something it had rarely been before: a place of family entertainment, where men and women, adults and children, could intermingle safe in the knowledge that no indecencies would assault their senses either on stage or off.\\" Additionally, Barnum implemented several morality plays to be shown in his auditorium, many of which taught against the dangers of drinking. Werner points out the accessibility of these performances saying, \\"many persons who would not be seen in a theatre visited regularly the Museum Lecture Room - Barnum would never consent to calling it a theatre - where the moral dramas of 'Joseph and His Brethren,' 'Moses,' and 'The Drunkard' were performed.\\" These were especially popular with women, as alcoholism was becoming rampant among working-class men. These plays were often seen as the height of family- friendly entertainment, because they taught good lessons that were appropriate for all ages. At one point, Barnum noticed that people were lingering too long at his exhibits. He posted signs indicating \\"This Way to the Egress\\". Not knowing that \\"Egress\\" was another word for \\"Exit\\", people followed the signs to what they assumed was a fascinating exhibit ‚Äî and ended up outside. The five-story building also served great educational value. Aside from the different attractions, the Museum also promoted educational ends, including natural history in its menageries, aquarium (which featured a large white whale), and taxidermy exhibits; history in its paintings, wax figures, and memorabilia; and temperance reform and Shakespearean dramas in the above described \\"Lecture Room\\" or theater. It was also the first museum to put human oddities on display as an organized freak show. It was the American Museum that began the modern-day trend of exploiting the human body for the sake of mass entertainment. The museum itself housed a mix of exhibits; some were extremely reputable and historically or scientifically valuable, while others were less so. One of Barnum's most successful attractions was his large selection of living animals, which were a highlight for the visitors who had never seen exotic creatures. Sadly, the animals in Barnum's \\"happy family\\" were poorly treated at best and neglected at worst.\\" Their standard of living is exemplified in the beluga whales he kept in a tank in the basement. The whales lived in a small 576 square foot tank, and when they frequently died Barnum \\"promptly set about procuring additional specimens.\\" See also * Barnum Museum ‚Äì completed in 1893 in Bridgeport, Connecticut * Sideshow * Dime museum * St. Paul Building, later built on the museum's site References External links * The Lost Museum ‚Äì Online version of the museum, published in 2000. * Barnum Museum Homepage - Homepage of the Barnum Museum Website * Gothamist.com - Details Barnum's most famous attractions * Priceonomics.com - The American Museum's ties to the modern freak show 1841 establishments in New York (state) 1865 disestablishments Broadway (Manhattan) Defunct museums in New York City Demolished buildings and structures in Manhattan Financial District, Manhattan John M.

He served two terms as mayor, first one having taken place from 1998 to 2001 and the second from 2004 to 2007.  Career  Chalifoux's first attempt at winning elected office was in the 1968 federal election, when he ran for the Liberal Party of Canada in the riding of Pembina. He finished a distant second to Progressive Conservative Jack Bigg. Before serving as mayor, Chalifoux was a city alderman and the assistant principal of St. Albert Catholic High School.http://www.stalbertgazette.com/news/2004/1020/top1.htm In 1998, he defeated three-term incumbent Anita Ratchinsky in an election whose major issue was the alignment of the proposed West Regional Road. Ratchinsky favoured a road that would bypass the developed portion of the city to the west by crossing the Sturgeon River close to the mouth of Big Lake, while Chalifoux supported an alignment that would cross the river further upstream. During Chalifoux's time as mayor, the road remained St. Albert's most contentious political issue. City Council approved Chalifoux's preferred alignment, by this time named Ray Gibbon Drive. In the 2001 election, Chalifoux was defeated by former mayor Dr. Richard Plain, who favoured the same alignment as Ratchinsky and proposed a plebiscite on the subject. Chalifoux challenged Plain again in 2004, campaigning this time on issues other than the road, saying that \\"it [was] time to move on\\". He won narrowly. On May 22, 2007, Chalifoux announced that he would not seek re-election (and, in so doing, provoke a third consecutive electoral battle against Plain) and would instead seek the nomination for the Progressive Conservatives in the next provincial election. Some perceived this as ironic given his past candidacy for the federal Liberals and given that he had inadvertently implicated the City of St. Albert in a minor scandal when he attended a fundraiser for the Alberta Liberal Party at the city's expense, which violated provincial law. Chalifoux acknowledges that he has been a member of the Liberal Party at both the provincial and federal levels at various points in his life, but claims that it has been more than a decade since his last provincial membership expired.

Founded as Bob's Surplus in Middletown, Connecticut, by Robert \\"Bob\\" Lapidus in 1954, the chain expanded gradually until it was acquired by TJX in 2003 and has been reacquired twice more since then. The chain targets moderate-income customers with a selection of footwear, workwear, teamwear, and activewear. History = Early years = In 1954, Bob Lapidus opened Bob's Surplus on Main Street in Middletown, Connecticut. His original business strategy was to \\"Treat all customers with respect and dignity and they will return again and again\\". As Bob's Surplus increased in popularity, its location was hindering its growth; in 1962, Lapidus moved the store to a larger building across the street. In 1967, the store was forced to move again after a fire destroyed the building. = 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s = In 1975, the second Bob's Surplus was opened in Enfield, Connecticut; the third store was opened in Hamden, Connecticut, in 1981. The chain renamed itself \\"Bob's Stores\\" in 1985, and began changing its marketing strategy by emphasizing quality and adding casual activewear to its list of products. In 1990, the chain had expanded to five stores; that year, it was acquired by the Melville Corporation (now CVS Corporation). Bob's expanded rapidly under the corporation; by March 1, 1996 the chain had grown to 34 stores across the northeastern United States. During this period, Melville considered Bob's Stores a key company, stating that they were spending time to \\"lay a solid base for rapid expansion for Bob's Stores in the years ahead\\". Bob's Stores remained most popular in its origin state of Connecticut. = Bob's Surplus logo t-shirts = In the 1970s and early 1980s the Bob's Surplus circular logo was featured on a line of very popular t-shirts that were sold inexpensively or given away for free at their stores. Both the t-shirts themselves and the Bob's Surplus logo that was printed on them were available in a large variety of color combinations. When the name of the chain was changed to Bob's Stores in 1985, the word \\"Surplus\\" on the logo was switched to \\"Stores\\"; however, sometime in the late 1980s a new rectangular Bob's Stores logo was introduced that the company still uses as of October 2018 (see the logo in the top right corner of this webpage). T-shirts with the new rectangular Bob's Stores logo--again in various color combinations--were also sold or given as freebies at their locations in the late 1980s and early 1990s.http://www.courant.com/business/dan-haar/hc-bobs- surplus-middletown-legacy-20170411-story.html = Late 1990s = Shopper's World in Framingham, Massachusetts, pictured in 2011 In 1997, Melville sold all of its chains except CVS Pharmacy; Bob's Stores was sold to the chain's management and Citicorp Venture Capital. In 1999, the upper executive level of the chain experienced numerous changes in personnel. Many others in the company became concerned with competition from stores like Kohl's, which began entering Bob's market area in late 1999 by acquiring many former Caldor locations following that chain's liquidation (as well as other stores). However, Bob's focus on sports team-related apparel was considered a strength during this period; one Bob's executive stated that the lack of a consistent national sports champion in the late 1990s hurt larger chains more than they hurt Bob's Stores, because consumers were more interested in regional teams (which the chain supplies). In 2000, Bob's Stores created its first website. = 2003 bankruptcy and TJX acquisition = In 2003, Bob's Stores went bankrupt. In late 2003, Dick's Sporting Goods outbid companies such as TJX Companies and tried to buy the chain for over $113 million. Dick's had intended to close most of the Bob's Stores locations. TJX felt that this was unfair to the employees and TJX brought it to court in Maine. The courts sided with TJX to save the thousands of jobs that would have been lost and TJX was allowed to purchase the chain for $113 million. TJX Companies expressed interest in Bob's Stores because it shared similar characteristics to other TJX chains, including large stores and similar brands. Although there were also numerous differences between Bob's Stores and TJX's other chains, one expert felt that this would help diversify TJX's lineup. = Sale and bankruptcy = On August 19, 2008, TJX announced they would sell Bob's to private equity firms Versa Capital Management and Crystal Capital. Bob's Stores launched an online store June 1, 2012. In April 2016, Vestis Retail Group, the Versa Capital-owned unit which owns the Sport Chalet and Eastern Mountain Sports sporting goods chains as well as Bob's, announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection and reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Vestis said it would reorganize and focus on the operations of Eastern Mountain and Bob's, while all Sports Chalet stores would close.Dawn McCarty & Steven Church, \\"Eastern Mountain in Bankruptcy as Shopping Habits Change\\", Bloomberg News, April 17, 2016. = Sports Direct acquisition = On April 19th 2017, after expanding to nearly 50 stores at its peak, Sports Direct International plc (Sports Direct) received permission to acquire Bob's Stores and Eastern Mountain Sports following Eastern Outfitters LLC's Chapter 11 filing. 9 out of 13 stores in Connecticut alone were scheduled for closure.http://www.courant.com/business/dan-haar/hc-bobs- surplus-middletown-legacy-20170411-story.html References External links Demographics breakdown for the company website American companies established in 1954 Retail companies established in 1954 1954 establishments in Connecticut Companies based in New Haven County, Connecticut Meriden, Connecticut Sports Direct ","title":"Bob's Stores"},{"id":"9701876","text":"Christopher Paul Persaud-Jagdhar (CJ) (born 27 December 1967) is a British musician of Guyanese and Seychellois descent.

The band released one album Prozaic in 1996 which charted at number 34 in the UK. Honeycrack toured with the likes of Alanis Morissette, Weezer, and Skunk Anansie throughout 1995 and 1996 as well as appearances at the Phoenix Festival and T in The Park. The band broke away from Epic in late 1996 and eventually disbanded. In 1998 CJ formed The Jellys with ex-Wildhearts drummer Stidi and former Wolfsbane bass player Jeff Hately. They released two studio albums and one live album between 1998 and 2001.  Solo career  CJ released his first solo album Thirteen in 2007 under the moniker CJ & The Satellites. The album was supported with live dates in the UK and China but were quickly put on hiatus due to the reformation of The Wildhearts in 2009. The album was reissued on CD and vinyl in 2014. Also in 2014, CJ released the album Mable, which was funded through the Pledgemusic platform and was named after his favourite chicken. Mable reached number 23 in the UK album chart; it also reached number 2 in the Official UK Rock Chart and number 2 in the Independent Album Breakers Chart, CJ's highest chart positions as a solo artist. Reviews were very positive across the board with The Sun newspaper commenting \\"CJ unleashes a scorching summer rock treat\\" and awarding it four out of five stars. Uber Rock commented \\"Not many albums will touch 'Mable' this year\\". The albums scored highly in end of year poll lists including number 2 the Pure Rawk album of the year list, number 6 in the Uber Rock album of the year list, and number 1 in the Rock 'n' Roll Geek Show album of the year list. On 6 March 2015 Mable received the Album of The Year award at the Pure Rawk Awards held in London. CJ released two more albums funded by pledge campaigns: Robot in 2015 and Blood in 2017. He has also launched his own brand of hot sauce called \\"Devilspit\\".  Return to The Wildhearts  The Jellys disbanded when CJ and Stidi both re-joined The Wildhearts in 2001 and recorded The Wildhearts Must Be Destroyed album. CJ would remain a permanent fixture in the band recording the eponymous album The Wildhearts in 2007 and Chutzpah! in 2009. The Wildhearts then went on hiatus before releasing their first new album in a decade, Renaissance Men, in 2019.

It was premiered in 1858. In 1859, Franz Liszt wrote an orchestral Festmarsch nach Motiven von E. H. z. S-C-G, S.116, based on themes from Diana von Solange (E. H. z. S-C-G was short for Ernst Herzog zu Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha).Grove's Dictionary of Music, 5th ed, 1954, Liszt: Works, p. 275 It received a brief appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1891. The opera was one of three novelties introduced for the 1890‚Äì91 season by the Metropolitan's general manager, Edmund C. Stanton; the others were Asrael by Alberto Franchetti, which opened the season on November 26, and Antonio Smareglia's Il vassallo di Szigeth. Both were poorly received. Diana von Solange, the last of the three, was first shown on January 9, 1891; the performance marked its American premiere. Pauline Sch√∂ller-Haag sang the title role to the Armand of Andreas Dippel. Marie Jahn, Conrad Behrens, Juan Luria, Edmund M√ºller, and Bruno Lurgenstein rounded out the cast, under the direction of Anton Seidl. The opera also contained a ballet, which was singled out for praise by the New York World. Reviews of the opera were almost all negative; one writer described the piece as \\"simply rubbish\\", while others derisively referred to it as \\"Diana von So-Langweilig\\" (so boring). Another critic predicted that the work would not last three performances in the house; in the event, it lasted two. When it was discovered that a third outing was intended on January 12, a petition, bearing three hundred signatures and demanding that the opera be removed from the repertory, was delivered to the management, who hastily replaced it with Fidelio. Diana von Solange marked the final blow against Stanton; two days after the cancelled third performance, on January 14, it was announced that he was to be replaced by Henry Eugene Abbey for the following season. Many critics wondered why, given its pedigree, its age, and its relative obscurity, Diana von Solange was even considered for performance by the Metropolitan. Although it was never proven, many critics suspected that Stanton and others in the company were motivated by the Duke's known \\"lavishness ... in the distribution of orders, especially among musicians\\".\\"...he has an unlimited supply of orders...All you have to do is to produce one of the Duke's operas and presto! you are decorated.\\" W. J. Henderson in The New York Times; quoted in Kolodin, p. 113 http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BibSpeed/fullcit.w?xCID=9400&limit;=2500&xBranch;=ALL&xsdate;=&xedate;=&theterm;=Diana%20von%20Solange%3A%20Celema%20 The general manager and other executives were believed to have in fact received such decorations, but were reportedly too ashamed of the whole debacle to be seen in public wearing them. However, Louis Auchincloss, Stanton's grand-nephew, suggests Stanton wanted to honor the Duke as a fellow admirer of Richard Wagner, to whom Ernest II had considered dedicating the opera.Auchincloss, p. 150 Despite the opera's poor reception, Andreas Dippel was singled out for praise by numerous critics; this, coupled with his other successes during the season, led to his being retained on the company's roster for the following year.

The modern \\"far right\\" or radical right grew out of two separate events of 1889: the splitting off in the Socialist International of those who chose the nation and the culmination of the \\"Boulanger Affair\\", which championed the demands of the former Minister of War General Georges Boulanger. The Dreyfus Affair provided one of the political division lines of France. Nationalism, which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right. A new right emerged, and nationalism was reappropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of ethnic nationalism, itself blended with anti-Semitism, xenophobia, anti- Protestantism and anti-Masonry. The Action fran√ßaise, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today. During the interwar period, the Action fran√ßaise (AF) and its youth militia, the Camelots du Roi, were very active. Far right leagues organized riots. The Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS) was created in Madrid by French military opposed to the independence of Algeria. Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the Front National (FN) party in 1972. At the 1986 legislative elections, the FN managed to obtain 35 seats, with 10% of the votes. Mark Frederiksen, a French Algeria activist, created in April 1966 a neo-Nazi group, the FANE (F√©d√©ration d'action nationaliste et europ√©enne, Nationalist and European Federation of Action). However, in 1978, neo-Nazi members of the GNR-FANE broke again with the FN. During the 1980s, the National Front managed to gather, under Jean-Marie Le Pen's leadership, most rival far-right tendencies of France, following a succession of splits and alliances with other, minor parties, during the 1970s.  Third Republic (1871‚Äì1914)  The Dreyfus Affair was a turning point in the political history of France and in the Third Republic (1871‚Äì1940), established after the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and the 1871 Paris Commune. The modern \\"far right\\" or radical right, grew out of two separate events of 1889. The Socialist International was formed at the Paris Conference, which imposed doctrinal orthodoxy on socialists and demanded their allegiance to the international working class rather than their nation. This forced patriotic socialists to choose either their nation or the international workers' movement. Many chose their nation and fell into violent conflict with their former socialist comrades. Those who chose the nation and retained the strategy of violence, then used most often against their former comrades, formed much of the base of the radical right. Many of those people also proved susceptible to the blandishments of anti-Semitism, which has long been a hallmark of the radical right. This would include (socialist) Maurice Barr√®s, (communardes) Henri Rochefort and Gustave Paul Cluseret, (Blanquists) Charles Bernard and Antoine Jourde, among others.Zeev Sternhell, La Droite R√©volutionaire, les origines fran√ßaises du fascisme, 1885-1914 (Paris: Ed. du Seuil, 1978)Robert Lynn Fuller, The Origins of the French Nationalist Movement, 1886-1914 (McFarland, 2012) Georges Ernest Boulanger (1837‚Äì1891) The second event of 1889 was the culmination of the \\"Boulanger Affair\\" which championed the vague demands of the former Minister of War General Georges Boulanger. Boulanger had attracted the support of many socialists by ordering lenient treatment of strikers when the army was called upon to suppress strikes. He also rattled his saber against Germany which pleased French patriots intent on taking revenge against the German Empire. But his saber- rattling scared the other ministers who dumped Boulanger from the government. When his champions mounted an electoral campaign to have him elected to the Chamber of Deputies, the government reacted by forcing him out of the Army. His backers then elected him to the Chamber again from Paris, where he gained the support of both conservatives, who loathed the Republic, and socialists with their own ideas about how the Republic should be remade. This joining of the left and right against the center formed the foundation upon which the radical right was built in subsequent years. Violent agitation in Paris on the election night in 1889 convinced the government to prosecute Boulanger in order to remove him from the political scene. Instead of facing trumped up charges, Boulanger fled to Belgium. His supporters, \\"Boulangists\\" afterward nursed an intense grievance against the Republic and reunited during the Dreyfus Affair to oppose the Republic and \\"back the army\\" once again.Fredric Seager, The Boulanger Affair, The Political Crossroads of France, 1886-1889 (Cornell University Press, 1969)William Irvine, The Boulanger Affair Reconsidered, Royalism, Boulagism, and the Origins of the Radical Right in France(Oxford University Press, 1989)Patrick Hutton The Cult of the Revolutionary Tradition: Blanquists in French Politics, 1864-1893 (U. of California Press, 1981) = Dreyfus Affair and foundation of the Action fran√ßaise = Degradation of Alfred Dreyfus, 1895 In 1894, a Jewish officer, Alfred Dreyfus, was arrested on accusations of treason and sharing intelligence with the German Empire. The Dreyfus Affair provided one of the political fault lines of France. Nationalism, which had been before the Dreyfus Affair a left-wing and Republican ideology, turned after that to be a main trait of the right-wing and, moreover, of the far right.Winock, Michel (dir.), Histoire de l'extr√™me droite en France (1993) √âmile Zola entered the political scene with his open letter \\"J'Accuse‚Ä¶!\\", followed by other writers, artists and scholars supporting him with a \\"Manifesto of the Intellectuals\\", helping to define the meaning of the term \\"intellectual\\", while the left and right were at loggerheads, mainly over the questions of militarism, nationalism, justice and human rights. Until then, nationalism was a Republican, left-wing ideology, related to the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars. It was a liberal nationalism, formulated by Ernest Renan's definition of the nation as a \\"daily plebiscite\\" and as formed by the subjective \\"will to live together.\\" Related to \\"revanchism\\", the belligerent will to take revenge against Germany and retake control of Alsace-Lorraine, nationalism could then be sometimes opposed to imperialism. In the 1880s, a debate thus opposed those who opposed the \\"colonial lobby\\", such as radical Georges Clemenceau, who declared that colonialism diverted France from the \\"blue line of the Vosges\\" (referring to Alsace-Lorraine), socialist Jean Jaur√®s and nationalist Maurice Barr√®s, against Moderate Republican Jules Ferry, republican L√©on Gambetta and Eug√®ne Etienne, the president of the parliamentary colonial group. However, in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair, a new right emerged, and nationalism was appropriated by the far right who turned it into a form of ethnic nationalism, itself blended with anti- Semitism, xenophobia, anti-Protestantism and anti-Masonry. Charles Maurras (1868‚Äì1952), founder of \\"integralism\\" (or \\"integral nationalism\\"), created the term \\"Anti-France\\" to stigmatize \\"internal foreigners\\", or the \\"four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners\\" (his actual word for the latter being the far less polite m√©t√®ques). A few years later, Maurras would join the monarchist Action fran√ßaise, created by Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois in 1898. Maurras, who was an agnostic, spearheaded a monarchist and Catholic revival. He pragmatically conceived of religion as an ideology useful to unify the nation. Most French Catholics were conservatives, a trait that continues today. On the other hand, most Protestants, Jews and atheists belonged to the left. Henceforth, the Republicans' conception was, to the contrary, that only state secularism could peacefully bind together diverse religious and philosophical tendencies, and avoid any return to the Wars of Religion. Furthermore, Catholic priests were seen as a major reactionary force by the Republicans, among whom anti-clericalism became common. The Ferry laws on public education had been a first step for the Republic in rooting out the clerics' influence: they would be completed by the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State. Action fran√ßaise, first founded as a review, was the matrix of a new type of counter-revolutionary right-wing, and continues to exist today. Action fran√ßaise was quite influential in the 1930s, in particular through its youth organization, the Camelots du Roi, founded in 1908, and which engaged in many street brawls, etc. The Camelots du Roi included such figures as Catholic writer Georges Bernanos and Jean de Barrau, member of the directing committee of the National Federation, and particular secretary of the duc d'Orl√©ans (1869‚Äì1926), the son of the Orleanist count of Paris (1838‚Äì1894) and hence Orleanist heir to the throne of France. Many members of the OAS terrorist group during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62) were part of the monarchist movement. Jean Ousset, Maurras' personal secretary, created the Catholic fundamentalist organization Cit√© catholique, which would include OAS members and founded a branch in Argentina in the 1960s. Apart from the Action fran√ßaise, several far-right leagues were created during the Dreyfus Affair. Mostly anti-Semitic, they also represented a new right-wing tendency, sharing common traits such as anti-parliamentarism, militarism, nationalism, and often engaged in street brawls. Thus, the nationalist poet Paul D√©roul√®de created in 1882 the anti-semitic Ligue des patriotes (League of Patriots), which at first focused on advocating 'revanche' (revenge) for the French defeat during the Franco-Prussian War. Along with Jules Gu√©rin, the journalist Edouard Drumont created the Antisemitic League of France in 1889. Also anti-masonic, the League became at the start of the 20th century the Grand Occident de France, a name chosen in reaction against the masonic lodge of the Grand Orient de France.  Between the wars  During the interwar period, the Action fran√ßaise (AF) and its youth militia, the Camelots du Roi, were very active in Paris.Eugen Weber, Action Fran√ßaise: Royalism and Reaction in Twentieth Century France (1962). Apart from the AF, various far-right leagues were formed and opposed both Cartel des gauches (Coalition of the left) governments. Pierre Taittinger thus formed the Jeunesses Patriotes in 1924, which imitated the style of the Fascists, although it remained a more traditional authoritarian movement. The following year, Georges Valois created Le Faisceau, heavily inspired by Benito Mussolini's Fascism. In 1933, the year Adolf Hitler gained power in Germany, perfumer Fran√ßois Coty founded Solidarit√© fran√ßaise and Marcel Bucard formed the Francisme, which was subsidised by Mussolini. Another important league was Fran√ßois de la Rocque's Croix de Feu, which formed the base for the Parti Social Fran√ßais (PSF), the first mass party of the French right-wing. Mussolini was much more popular in right-wing circles than Hitler due to the negative reaction many French conservatives had to Hitler's repression of dissident German conservatives and Catholics in 1933 and 1934.Robert J. Soucy, \\"French press reactions to Hitler's first two years in power.\\" Contemporary European History 7.1 (1998): 21-38. Apart from the leagues, a group of Neosocialists (Marcel D√©at, Pierre Renaudel, etc.) were excluded in November 1933 from the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO, the socialist party) because of their revisionist stances and admiration for fascism. D√©at would become one of the most ardent collaborationists during World War II. Another major player in France's right-wing world between the wars was Jacques Doriot. Doriot had been expelled by the French Communist Party after proposing a Popular Front with other leftist parties, which at that time was seen as heresy by his party's hierarchy. Personally hurt and embittered by his expulsion, Doriot would slowly change sides, eventually openly denouncing communism and going on to found the Parti Populaire Francais or PPF, the largest pre-war right wing party. Other important figures of the 1930s include Xavier Vallat, who would become General Commissioner for Jewish Affairs under Vichy, members of the Cagoule terrorist group (Eug√®ne Deloncle, Eug√®ne Schueller, the founder of L'Or√©al cosmetic firm, Jacques Corr√®ze, Joseph Darnand, who later founded the Service d'ordre l√©gionnaire militia during Vichy, etc.). To obtain arms from fascist Italy, the group assassinated two Italian antifascists, the Rosselli brothers,Stanislao G. Pugliese Death in Exile: The Assassination of Carlo Rosselli, Journal of Contemporary History, 32 (1997), pp. 305-319M. Agronsky, Foreign Affairs 17#391 (1938) on June 9, 1937, and sabotaged aeroplanes clandestinely supplied by the French government to the Second Spanish Republic. They also attempted a coup against the Popular Front government, elected in 1936, leading to arrests in 1937, ordered by Interior Minister Marx Dormoy, during which the police seized explosives and military weapons, including anti-tank guns.Time Magazine Terrible Gravity Monday, November 29, 1937 Far right leagues organised major riots on 6 February 1934.William D. Irvine, . French Conservatism in Crisis: The Republican Federation of France in the 1930s (1979) The groups did not coordinate their efforts and the riots were suppressed by the police and military. Elements on the left were convinced that uniots was essential to suppress fascism, and in 1936 they formed the Popular Front and dissolved the leagues. However the right-wing leagues promptly reorganized as political parties and continued vocal attacks on the left.  Vichy France   Fourth Republic and the Algerian War  The Organisation arm√©e secr√®te (OAS) was created in Madrid by French military officers opposed to the independence of Algeria. Many of its members would later join various anti-communist struggles around the world. Some, for example, joined the Cit√© catholique fundamentalist group and went to Argentina, where they were in contact with the Argentine Armed Forces. Jean Pierre Cherid, former OAS member, took part in the 1976 Montejurra massacre against left-wing Carlists.MONTEJURRA: LA OPERACI√ìN RECONQUISTA Y EL ACTA FUNDACIONAL DE LAS TRAMAS ANTITERRORISTAS. Fuente \\"INTERIOR\\" Por Santiago Belloch Rodolfo Almir√≥n, de la Triple A al Montejurra , PDF He was then part of the Spanish GAL death squad, and participated in the 1978 assassination of Argala, one of the ETA members who had killed Franco's Prime minister, Luis Carrero Blanco, in 1973. Jean-Louis Tixier- Vignancour was the far-right candidate at the 1965 presidential election. His campaign was organised by Jean-Marie Le Pen. Charles de Gaulle said of Tixier- Vignancourt: \\"Tixier-Vignancour, that is Vichy, the Collaboration proud of itself, the Milice, the OAS\\".  Fifth Republic  Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the Front National in 1972 and led them until 2011 Jean-Marie Le Pen founded the Front National (FN) party in 1972, along with former Occident member Jacques Bompard, former Collaborationist Roland Gaucher, Fran√ßois Duprat, who introduced the negationist thesis to France,Henry Rousso, \\"Les habits neufs du n√©gationniste,\\" in L'Histoire n¬∞318, March 2007, pp.26-28 and others nostalgics of Vichy France, Catholic fundamentalists, etc.Le Pen, son univers impitoyable, Radio France Internationale, September 1, 2006 Le Pen presented himself for the first time in the 1974 presidential election, obtaining 0.74%. The electoral rise of the FN did not start until Jean-Pierre Stirbois's victory, in 1983, in Dreux. The FN became stronger throughout the 1980s, managing to unite most far-right tendencies, passing electoral alliances with the right-wing Rally for the Republic (RPR), while some FN members quit the party to join the RPR or the Union for a French Democracy (UDF). At the 1986 legislative elections, the FN managed to obtain 35 seats, with 10% of the votes. Meanwhile, other far-right tendencies gathered in Alain de Benoist's Nouvelle Droite think-tank, heading a pro-European line. Some radical members of the \\"national revolutionary\\" tendency quit the FN to form other minor parties (Party of New Forces, PFN, and French and European Nationalist Party, PNFE). = French Third Position's relations with the National Front = Mark Frederiksen, a French Algeria activist, created in April 1966 a neo-Nazi group, the FANE (F√©d√©ration d'action nationaliste et europ√©enne, Nationalist and European Federation of Action). The FANE boasted at most a hundred activists, including members such as Luc Michel, now leader of the Parti communautaire national-europ√©en (National European Communautary Party), Jacques Bastide, Michel Faci, Michel Caignet and Henri-Robert Petit, a journalist and former Collaborationist who directed under the Vichy regime the newspaper Le Pilori. The FANE maintained international contacts with the British group the League of Saint George.R. Hill & A. Bell, The Other Face of Terror- Inside Europe‚Äôs Neo-Nazi Network, London: Collins, 1988, pp.186-189 The FANE rallied Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front in 1974, gathered around Fran√ßois Duprat and Alain Renault's Revolutionary Nationalist Groups (GNR), which represented the nationalist revolutionary tendency of the FN. But in 1978, neo-Nazi members of the GNR-FANE broke again with the FN, taking with them sections of the FN youth movement, the Front National de la Jeunesse.Annuaire de l'extr√™me droite en France On the other hand, GNR activists closer to the Third Position (Jacques Bastide and Patrick Gorre) joined Jean-Gilles Malliarakis to found, on February 11, 1979, the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (Mouvement nationaliste r√©volutionnaire), which became in 1985 Third Way (Troisi√®me Voie). After this brief passage at the National Front, Mark Fredriksen created the Faisceaux nationalistes europ√©ens (FANE) in July 1980. These would eventually merge with the Mouvement national et social ethniste in 1987, and then with the PNFE (French and European Nationalist Party) in January 1994, which also gathered former National Front members. Dissolved first in September 1980 by Raymond Barre's government, Fredriksen's group was recreated, and dissolved again in 1985 by Laurent Fabius' government. Finally, it was dissolved a third time in 1987 by Jacques Chirac's government, on charges of \\"violent demonstrations organised by this movement, which has as one of its expressed objective the establishment of a new Nazi regime,\\" the \\"paramilitary organisation of this association and its inciting of racial discrimination.\\" = Alain de Benoist's Nouvelle Droite and the Club de l'Horloge = In the 1980s, Alain de Benoist became chief theorist of the Nouvelle Droite movement, creating the think-tank GRECE in 1968, some of whose members were involved with the formation of the Club de l'Horloge in 1974. They advocated an ethno-nationalist stance focused on European culture, which advocated a return of paganism. Members of the GRECE quit the think tank in the 1980s, such as Pierre Vial who joined the FN, or Guillaume Faye who quit the organisation along with others members in 1986. Faye participated in 2006 in a conference in the US organised by American Renaissance, a white separatist magazine published by the New Century Foundation. Alain de Benoist occasionally contributed to the Mankind Quarterly review, which supports hereditarianism and is associated with the US think tank the Pioneer Fund, headed by J. Philippe Rushton, the author of Race, Evolution and Behavior (1995), which argues in favour of a biological conception of \\"race\\". GRECE and the Pioneer Fund are actively involved in the race and intelligence debate, postulating that there is an identifiable link between levels of intelligence and distinct ethnic groups. The Club de l'horloge itself had been founded by Henry de Lesquen, a former member of the conservative Rally for the Republic, which he quit in 1984. Others members of the Club de l'horloge, such as Bruno M√©gret, later joined the FN after a short time in the RPR. = Rise of the National Front in the 1980s and M√©gret's split = During the 1980s, the National Front managed to gather, under Jean- Marie Le Pen's leadership, most rival far-right tendencies of France, following a succession of splits and alliances with other, minor parties, during the 1970s.  Party of New Forces  One of those parties, the Party of New Forces (PFN, Parti des forces nouvelles), was an offshoot of the National Front, formed from a 1973 split headed by Alain Robert and Fran√ßois Brigneau who first organised the Comit√© faire front which subsequently merged into the PFN. The PFN was formed mainly by former members of New Order (Ordre nouveau, 1969‚Äì1973), who had refused to merge into the FN at its 1972 creation. New Order, dissolved by Interior Minister Raymond Marcellin in 1973, was itself a successor to Occident (1964‚Äì1968) and of the Union Defense Group (GUD, Groupe union d√©fense). Close to the Third Position and supporting a \\"national-revolutionary\\" thesis, this tendency maintained links with the FN, despite some tensions. The GUD, in particular, had published the satiric monthly Alternative with the Youth Front (Front de la jeunesse), the youth organisation of the FN. They also had attempted alliances with other far-right parties in Europe, with New Order organising the alliance \\"A Fatherland for Tomorrow\\" (Une patrie pour demain) with the Spanish Falange, the Italian Social Movement (MSI) and the German National Democratic Party. This European strategy was continued by the PFN, who launched the Euroright alliance, with the MSI, the Spanish New Force and the Belgian PFN, for the 1979 European elections. Headed by Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour, the PFN won 1.3% of the vote. This electoral failure prompted Roland Gaucher and Fran√ßois Brigneau to quit the party and join Le Pen's National Front.  1981 presidential election  The French far-right was divided in the 1981 presidential election, with both Pascal Gauchon (PFN) and Le Pen (FN) attempting, without success, to secure the 500 signatures from mayors necessary to stand as candidates. Fran√ßois Mitterrand (Socialist Party) won those elections, competing against Jacques Chirac (Rally for the Republic, RPR).  1983 elections and rise  These succeeding electoral defeats prompted the far- right to unify itself. In 1983, the FN managed to make its first electoral breakthrough, taking control of the town of Dreux: Jean-Pierre Stirbois obtained 17% of the votes in the first round, for the FN municipal list. In the second round, he merged his list with Chirac's RPR list (headed by Jean Hieaux), enabling the right to claim a victory against the left. Chirac supported the alliance with the far-right, claiming that the Socialist Party, allied with the Communist Party in government, had no lessons to give.Franz- Olivier Giesbert, La Trag√©die du Pr√©sident, 2006, p 37-38 This first electoral success was confirmed at the 1984 European elections, the FN obtaining 10% of the votes. Two years later, the FN gained 35 deputies (nearly 10% of the votes) at the 1986 legislative elections, running under the label of \\"Rassemblement national. Those elected included the monarchist Georges-Paul Wagner. Internal disputes continued however to divide the far-right. Following the 1986 elections, which brought Jacques Chirac to power as Prime Minister, some hardliners inside the FN broke away to create the French and European Nationalist Party (PNFE, Parti Nationaliste Fran√ßais et Europ√©en), along with members of Mark Frederiksen's Third Position FANE. Three former members of the PNFE were charged of having desecrated, in 1990, a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras.La profanation de Carpentras a √©t√© longuement pr√©m√©dit√©e, L'Humanit√©, 7 August 1996  M√©gret's split, Le Pen's 2002 score and subsequent electoral fall  The most important split, however, was headed by Bruno M√©gret in 1999. Taking many FN elected representatives and party officials with him, he then created the National Republican Movement (MNR). However, with an eye to the 2007 legislative elections, he supported Le Pen's candidacy for the presidential election. During these presidential elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen only took 10.4% of the vote, compared to his 16.9% first round result in 2002, qualifying him for the second round, where he achieved 17.79% against 82.21% for Jacques Chirac (Rally for the Republic, RPR). With only 1.85% in the second round of the 2002 legislative elections, the FN failed to gain any seats in the National Assembly. In the 2007 presidential election, Le Pen finished fourth, behind Nicolas Sarkozy, S√©gol√®ne Royal and Fran√ßois Bayrou. Philippe de Villiers, the Catholic traditionalist candidate of the Movement for France (especially strong in the conservative Vend√©e region), was sixth, obtaining 2.23% of the vote. This electoral slump for the FN was confirmed at the 2007 legislative elections, the FN obtaining only 0.08% of the votes in the second round, and therefore no seats.  Le Pen's succession  Marine Le Pen succeeded her father as Front National leader in 2011 These electoral defeats, which contrasted with the high score obtained at the 2002 presidential elections, caused financial problems for the FN, which was forced to sell its headquarters, the Paquebot, in Saint-Cloud. Le Pen then announced, in 2008, that he would not compete again in presidential elections, leaving the way for contest for the leadership of the FN between his daughter, Marine Le Pen, whom he favoured, and Bruno Gollnisch.Succession : Le Pen confie pr√©f√©rer sa fille √† Bruno Gollnisch, Nouvel Observateur, 16 September 2008 The latter had been condemned in January 2007 for Holocaust denial,Bruno Gollnisch condamn√© pour ses propos sur l'Holocauste , REUTERS cable published by L'Express on January 18, 2007 -- URL accessed on January 18, 2007 d√©lit de contestation de l'existence de crime contre l'humanit√© par paroles while Marine Le Pen attempted to follow a slicker strategy to give the FN a more \\"respectable\\" image. = FN 2010s surge = Since her election as the leader of the party in 2011, the popularity of the FN continued to grow apace as the party won several municipalities at the 2014 municipal elections; it topped the poll in France at the 2014 European elections with 25% of the vote; and again won more votes than any other party in the 2015 departmental elections. The party once again came in first place in the 2015 regional elections with a historic result of just under 28% of the vote. By 2015, the FN had established itself as one of the largest political forces in France, unusually being both most popular and most controversial political party. For the 2012 presidential election, Le Pen came third in the first round, scoring 17.9% ‚Äì the partys then best showing ever for the FN. For the 2017 presidential election, Le Pen came second in the first round, scoring 21.3% ‚Äì the best showing ever for the FN. in the second round she came second with 33.9% a best for NF.

The promontory is well described by Strabo vi. p. 257. as a projecting rocky headland, jutting out boldly into the sea, and united to the mainland by a narrow neck or isthmus, so as to form two small but well sheltered bays, one on each side. There can be no doubt that this rocky promontory was the one which became the subject of so many fables, and which was represented by Homer and other poets as the abode of the monster Scylla.Homer The Odyssey xii. 73, etc., 235, etc. But the dangers of the rock of Scylla were far more fabulous than those of its neighbor Charybdis, and it is difficult to understand how, even in the infancy of navigation, it could have offered any obstacle more formidable than a hundred other headlands whose names are unknown to fame.Seneca Ep. 79; William Henry Smyth, Sicily, p. 107. At a later period Anaxilas, the despot of Rhegium, being struck with the natural strength of the position, fortified the rock, and established a naval station there, for the purpose of checking the incursions of the Tyrrhenian pirates.Strabo vi. p. 257. In consequence of this a small town grew up on the spot; and hence Pliny speaks of an oppidum Scyllaeum; but it was probably always a small place, and other writers speak only of the promontory.Pliny iii. 5. s. 10; Pomponius Mela ii. 4. ¬ß 8; Ptolemy iii. 1. ¬ß 9.; Stephanus of Byzantium s. v.) At the present day the rock is still occupied by a fort, which is a post of considerable strength, while a small town (modern Scilla) stretches down the slopes towards the two bays. The distance from the castle to the opposite point of the Sicilian coast, marked by the Torre del Faro, is stated by William Henry Smyth at 6047 yards (c. 5.5 km), or rather less than 3.5 English miles, but the strait afterwards contracts considerably, so that its width between the Punta Pezzo ancient: Caenys Prom. and the nearest point of Sicily does not exceed 3971 yards (c. 3.6 km).Smyth, Sicily, p. 108.

Recordings are stored on an SD card (128 MB supplied), or via a USB cable to a computer running digital audio workstation software (Cubase LE supplied).  Applications and recording formats  The H4 can record in stereo or four-track mode. In stereo mode WAV or compressed (MP3) files may be made. A 2GB card will store 95 hours of speech-quality or 3 hours of CD-quality recording. With device firmware from version 2.0, SDHC cards up to 32GB in size are supported, storing 16 hours at the highest-quality setting (uncompressed PCM WAV, 24 bit, 96 kHz, stereo). Basic four-track recordings can be made in the field with the built-in microphones and two additional input ports which accept external signal sources via XLR or 1/4-inch connectors. Stereo mode In stereo mode, the user has a wide choice of sound quality, with lower quality requiring less storage space. Only 44.1 kHz 16-bit recordings can be imported into four-track mode. All stereo recordings share a single folder, and on playback are sequenced as one continuous output stream with no pause between files. Stereo recording can use the built-in microphones or external input via 1/4-inch or XLR plugs. 4-track mode Four-track recordings can be made of one or two tracks at a time. When recording in stereo, only tracks 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, can be chosen. Four- track recordings are limited to 16-bit/44.1 kHz WAV files. WAV recordings made in stereo mode can be imported into a project folder. When recording on one or two tracks, the other tracks may be played back simultaneously (see multi- track recording). Each track can be individually panned, to create a stereo image. Any or all tracks can be mixed down to a stereo bounce file. This can be the last step in mixing, or an intermediate step to free up other tracks.  Effects  The H4 incorporates a 32-bit DSP that provides various effects as well as modelling of different types of microphone and guitar amplifiers. Up to 60 effects patches can be stored. Internal clock issue It has been reported that all H4 recorders have a serious flaw: the internal clock is not precise, with a typical error of a few seconds per hour. As a result, recorded audio is out of sync with other devices (e.g., camcorders) and has to be stretched in order to achieve synchronization.

Webber was born in Newbury, Vermont. His father, Andrew Webber, moved his family to Steuben County, New York in 1828 and engaged in farming. George Webber attended the common schools there and the academy at Alfred, New York. He engaged in business as a lumber- dealer and general merchant. On July 18, 1850, he married Miss Antoinette C. Abbey of Ulster County, New York. in 1852, Webber moved to Manistee County where he engaged in farming, lumbering, manufacturing, and mercantile pursuits. In the election of 1856, Webber was instrumental in promoting the newly formed Republican Party and the candidacy of John C. Fremont for President, such that only three votes in the entire county went to the Democratic Party candidate. In 1858, Webber moved to Ionia County, and engaged in mercantile business with his brother, S. W. Webber, at Lyons. After five years, he sold his interest to his brother and moved to Ionia, where he engaged in business with H. J. Wilson, as Webber & Wilson for five years. During the same period, he also engaged in lumbering on the Little Muskegon River with Fred Hall under the name Hall & Webber. After three years, Hall's interest in the enterprise was purchased by A. J Webber, and the firm took the name Webber Brothers. The brothers also established a prosperous farm and founded the village of Mecosta on their land. In 1870, he began a private banking enterprise in Muir with his brother S. W. Webber, to whom he sold his interest after four years. He was one of the most prominent organizers of the Second National Bank of Ionia, where he served first as vice-president and then as president, a position he continued to hold until his death. Webber was one of the village trustees of Ionia at the time it incorporated as a city and he assisted in drafting the charter. He was twice elected mayor of Ionia, in 1874 and 1875. He was responsible for construction of the Webber Block in 1879 at a cost of $15,000 and the Webber brownstone block in 1880 at a cost of $30,000. Rooms in the latter block were fitted for the use of the Ladies Library Association and donated to their use for as long as Webber or his wife was alive. Webber was also the principal owner of the Second National Bank Block. During his term as mayor, a bridge was built over the Grand River. Webber was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 5th congressional district to the 47th United States Congress, serving from March 4, 1881 to March 3, 1883. He was not a candidate for re-nomination in 1882. George W. Webber resumed his former business activities and was a Michigan delegate to Republican National Convention in 1884. His first wife died on April 11, 1890. He married Miss E. Gertrude Brown of Boston on November 2, 1890. He died in Ionia and is interred there in Highland Park Cemetery.

He is widely regarded as having one of the strongest legs in high school, collegiate and NFL history. Early Life Richey began his football career at Carencro High School in Louisiana. While at Carencro, he converted 24-of-34 field goals, including a 52-yard field goal in 1992 and a 53-yard field goal in 1993. Richey also converted a career total of 46-of-49 extra points, while 90 percent of his kickoffs resulted in touchbacks. 37 of those kickoffs split the uprights. At the end of his senior year, Richey was ranked as the number-one kicker in the nation and was named to the USA Today All-American football team. At LSU Over 30 universities offered Richey a full athletic scholarship, making him one the most coveted kicking specialists in high school football history. Richey eventually stayed in-state, choosing LSU over Stanford and Notre Dame. Richey struggled at LSU, converting just 8-of-23 field goals. He was primarily a kickoff specialist at LSU during his freshman and sophomore years but seized the starting role in 1996 as a junior. During the 1996 season he set a LSU school record with a 54-yard field goal against Kentucky. In the 1997 season, he was responsible for most of the placekicking duties, splitting time with back-up placekicker Danny Boyd. Professional Career After his collegiate career, Richey went undrafted but signed with the Seattle Seahawks for the 1998 preseason. Richey's impressive preseason performance with the Seahawks prompted the San Francisco 49ers to claim him off waivers, making him the starter for their season opener. Richey played from 1998‚Äì2002 for the San Francisco 49ers and the San Diego Chargers. In the 2003 he played for the Baltimore Ravens as a kickoff specialist and converted a 56-yard field goal against the Cleveland Browns on Sept. 14, 2003.

Abstract. This theory was invented by economists Edward Lazear and Sherwin Rosen.Edward P. Lazear and Sherwin Rosen, 1981. \\"Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts,\\" Journal of Political Economy, 89(5), pp. 841-864. The theory has been applied to professional sports and to the practice of law. Tournament theory also was applied to writing - one writer may be fractionally better at writing than another (and therefore have a better book), but because people allocate small amounts of time to reading, the writer with the marginally better book will sell far more copies. Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labour Contracts Lazear and Rosen proposed tournament theory in their 1981 paper Rank-Order Tournaments as Optimum Labor Contracts, looking at performance related pay. Under conventional systems workers are paid a piece rate - an amount of money that relates to their output, rather than the time they input. Tournament theory suggests that workers can be rewarded by their rank in an organization, suggesting why large salaries are given to senior executives: to provide a 'prize' to those who put in enough effort to garner one of the top positions. The paper invites the reader to consider the lifetime output of a worker at a firm. This output is dictated by two things - chance and skill. The worker can control his lifetime output by investing in skills early on in life, like studying hard at school and getting good qualifications, but a part of that output will be determined by chance. Participants in the tournament commit their investment early on in life and are unlikely to know each other previously, within the firm they work in, and may not even know each other within the firm. This prevents collusion or cheating in the tournament. Looking at the tournament in its simplest form, a two player tournament, where there is a prize for the winner and a smaller consolation for the loser. The incentive to win increases as the difference between the losing and winning prize increases, and therefore the investment of the worker is increased as the difference between the winning and losing prizes is increased. It is in the interest of the firm to increase the spread of prizes. However there is a drawback for the firms. As the workers invest more their costs rise. Competing firms could offer a tournament with a lower spread and attract more workers because they would have to invest less. Therefore, there is an optimal prize spread that firms set, high enough to induce investment but low enough so that the investment is not too expensive for the worker. The prize may take the form of extra cash or a promotion - which means more money, as well as entering a higher level of tournament, where the stakes may be higher. The idea that the prize may be in the form of a promotion explains why presidents are paid significantly more than vice presidents. In one day a Vice-President may be promoted to President of a company and have his pay tripled. Considering piece rates this seems illogical - his output is unlikely to have tripled in one day. But looking at it using tournament theory it seems logical - he has won the tournament and received his prize - presidency. Tournament theory is an efficient way of labour compensation when quantifying output is difficult or expensive, but ranking workers is easy. It is also effective as it provides goals for workers and incentivises hard work so that they may one day attain one of the coveted positions at the top. An advantage to workers over a piece rate would be that in the event of a natural disaster they would preserve their wage as their output would go down in absolute terms but stay the same relative to their colleagues. This means that in times of disaster workers could maintain their wage. Benefits of tournament (+) Motivates workers (+) Offers stability during volatile market conditions (reduce shocks) (+) Selecting workers (observe) (+) Reduce variability in pay (commit & credible) (+) Encourage Long-run behaviour to stay Foundational Principles There are two foundational predictions of tournament theory. These predictions can be illustrated by examining a simple two-player contest with identical risk-neutral actors.Charles R. Knoeber and Walter N. Thurman, 'Testing the Theory of Tournaments: An Empirical Analysis of Broiler Production' (1994) 12(2) Journal of Labor Economics 155, 156-7; Brian L. Connelly et al, 'Tournament Theory: Thirty Years of Contests and Competitions' 40(1) Journal of Management 16, 19-20. Let performance (output) be measured by q: Here, u represents the effort or investment by a player, while e is a random component (e.g. luck or noise). Players are rewarded for performance with one of two prices, W_1 or W_2, where W_1>W_2. W_1 goes to the player with better performance, while W_2 goes to the player with worse performance. Each player's actions have a cost associated, denoted by C(u). The probability that player a wins W_1 is positively related to that player's action u_a and negatively related to the opponent player's action u_b, as well as the random component e. If P is the probability of winning, then the contestant can receive the following payoff: When player a chooses u_i to maximise his/her payoff, then: In a two-player tournament the Nash equilibrium occurs when both players maximise their payoff while assuming the other player's effort is fixed. At this equilibirum the marginal cost of effort C' is equal to the marginal value of effort V, such that: From this equation, two principles can be derived. The first is that an actor's level of effort increases with the spread between the winning and losing prize.Brian L. Connelly et al, 'Tournament Theory: Thirty Years of Contests and Competitions' 40(1) Journal of Management 16, 20. The second is that only the difference between the winning and the losing prize matters to the two contestants, not the absolute size of their winnings.Charles R. Knoeber and Walter N. Thurman, 'Testing the Theory of Tournaments: An Empirical Analysis of Broiler Production' (1994) 12(2) Journal of Labor Economics 155, 157. These two testable predictions of tournament theory have been supported by empirical research over the years, especially in the fields of labour economicsAndrew Schotter and Keither Weigelt, 'Asymmetric Tournaments, Equal Opportunity Laws, and Affirmative Action: Some Experimental Results' (1992) 107(2) The Quarterly Journal of Economics 511. and sports.Ronald G. Ehrenberg and Michael Bognanna, 'The Incentive Effects of Tournaments Revisited: Evidence from the European PGA Tour' (1990) 43(3) Industrial and Labor Relations Review 74S. Pros and Cons of Workplace Tournaments Incentivizing Performance Tournaments can be very powerful at incentivising performance. Empirical research in economics and managements have shown that tournament-like incentive structure increases the individual performance or workers and managers in the workplace.Roman M. Sheremeta, 'The pros and cons of workplace tournaments' (2016) 302 IZA World of Labor 1, 2. The distribution of effort for one tournament experiment found that almost 80% of participants exert higher than anticipated levels of efforts, thus suggesting that tournaments provides strong competition incentives.Roman M. Sheremeta., 'Impulsive Behavior in Competition: Testing Theories of Overbidding in Rent-seeking Contests' (Working Paper, 2016) [6] Tournaments also provide powerful non-monetary incentives. Studies show that participants in tournaments value winning itself and placing highly on relative rankings.Roman M. Sheremeta, 'The pros and cons of workplace tournaments' (2016) 302 IZA World of Labor 1, 3 One experiment found that more than 40% of individuals were willing to exert positive effort with a monetary incentive of $0.Roman M. Sheremeta, 'Experimental comparison of multi-stage and one-stage contests' (2010) 68 Games and Economic Behavior731‚àí747 Matching workers and jobs Tournaments play an important function in matching workers with jobs that are relevant/appropriate. The theoretical prediction in the literature is that higher-skilled individuals would be sorted into jobs that offer higher potential returns.Roman M. Sheremeta, 'The pros and cons of workplace tournaments' (2016) 302 IZA World of Labor 1, 5. This is well- supported by empirical data. For instance, in the field of competitive running more accomplished competitors with greater capabilities are more likely to choose tournaments with greater prize spreads.Roman M. Sheremeta, 'The pros and cons of workplace tournaments' (2016) 302 IZA World of Labor 1, 5. Inequalities in the workplace Tournaments have the potential to create large inequalities in payoffs. Incentive based tournaments are organised in such a way that some winners are created at the expense of many losers.Frank, R., and P. Cook. The Winner-Take-All Society. New York: The Free Press, 1996. Thus, by design there are likely to be high inequalities in payoffs in the workplace under a tournament structure. A further potential inequality is gender inequality in the workplace. Field studies have shown that women are less likely to enter tournaments than men and also do not perform as well.Niederle, M., and L. Vesterlund. ‚ÄúDo women shy away from competition? Do men compete too much?‚Äù Quarterly Journal of Economics 122 (2007): 1067‚àí1101. Thus, even in cases where women may be more capable or better skilled, tournament-like incentives may discourage women from participating. However, this is not absolute and there are some research that shows women may be more competitive than men and perform better in certain tournament settings.Dechenaux, E., D. Kovenock, and R. M. Sheremeta. ‚ÄúA survey of experimental research on contests, all-pay auctions and tournaments.‚Äù Experimental Economics 18 (2015): 609‚àí669. Selfish and Unethical Behaviour A major issue with tournaments is that individuals are incentivised to view others as competitors, thus encouraging selfish behaviour. This means that participants in a tournament structured workplace would be less likely to help each other and are discourage from knowledge sharing more so than in other incentive schemes.Drago, R., and G. T. Garvey. ‚ÄúIncentives for helping on the job: Theory and evidence.‚Äù Journal of Labor Economics 16 (1998): 1‚àí25. Further, tournaments may also encourage unethical behaviour in participants such as cheating or collusion in competitive sports or plagiarism in the academic field.Roman M. Sheremeta, 'The pros and cons of workplace tournaments' (2016) 302 IZA World of Labor 1, 6.

It is a comprehensive building complex consisting of three towers rising from an eight-storey base. Designed by John C. Portman, Jr., the Shanghai Centre was one of the first contemporary skyscrapers to be built in Shanghai. It occupies a prestige location, across West Nanjing Road from the Russian neo-classical style Shanghai Exhibition Centre complex, with whose central axis the Shanghai Centre's central axis is aligned. The whole complex hosts 472 apartment units, 30,000 sq. meters of high-end office area, a supermarket, three stories of luxury department stores, the Shanghai Centre Theatre, a Trading Exhibition Centre, and a 5-star hotel (The Portman Ritz Carlton Shanghai, named after the architect). The complex opened in April, 1990, and it consists of three towers and several accessory buildings. The eight-storey pedestal building fronts onto West Nanjing Road. The building's frontage is not aligned with the street: in order to align the central axis with that of the Shanghai Exhibition Centre on the other side of West Nanjing Road (the main frontage of which in turn faces, and therefore is aligned with, Yan'an Road), the Shanghai Centre was built at an angle to West Nanjing Road. The three towers are arranged symmetrically \\"rising\\" out of the pedestal: one at the centre and towards the back, and two symmetrically to the left and right, further to the front. The three towers have similar profiles, with a memorable feature being a slight widening of the long side of each tower towards the top, giving each tower a profile reminiscent of traditional Chinese monumental stelae or towers.

The malu covers the legs from just below the knee to the upper thighs just below the buttocks, and is typically finer and delicate in design compared to the Pe'a, the equivalent tattoo for males. The malu takes its name from a particular motif of the same name, usually tattooed in the popliteal fossa (sometimes referred to as the kneepit, or poplit) behind the knee. It is one of the key motifs not seen on men. According to Samoan scholar Albert Wendt and tattooist Su'a Suluape Paulo II, in tattooing the term ‚Äòmalu‚Äô refers to notions of sheltering and protection.Wendt, A. (1999). Afterword: Tatauing the post-colonial body. Inside out: Literature, cultural politics, and identity in the new Pacific, 399-412.Mallon, S. (2002). Samoan art and artists. University of Hawaii Press. Samoan women were also tattooed on the hands and sometimes the lower abdomen. These practices have undergone a resurgence since the late 1990s.Mallon, S. (2005). Samoan tatau as global practice. Tattoo: Bodies, Art, and Exchange in the Pacific and the West, 145-169.  Changing significance  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, only the district Paramount Chief's daughter was eligible to wear the malu and it was applied to these young women in the years following puberty. Women with the malu were expected to perform key ceremony tasks and represent their families and villages on ceremonial occasions. However, in 1930, anthropologist Te Rangi Hiroa observed that \\"...the tattooing of a girl is often used as an opportunity for a student to try his prentice hand. This is also rendered possible by the fact that there is no fusita (fine mat) passed or any of the ceremony that marks the tattooing of the male. It is often sufficient reward for the novice to have the opportunity of practice and to be well fed during the period occupied by the operation...For the daughter of a high chief, who is to become the village taupou, it can be readily understood that an expert artist would be requisitioned and his reward greater.\\" Ceremonial roles are still important in Samoan society and are restricted in similar ways to particular people with the correct qualifications and cultural knowledge, but the significance of the malu has shifted. From at least the 1990s, there has been less emphasis on chiefly qualifications, and women of a variety of backgrounds and ages have been tattooed with the malu. However, the malu is not important to all Samoans, or the only symbol of an individuals commitment or participation in Samoan cultural life. In the Samoan congregations of some churches, men and women have been discouraged from getting tattooed.' In New Zealand and Australia, the malu is increasingly important as a symbol of Samoan cultural identity rather than only a signifier of a persons ability to carry out specific Samoan ceremonial roles.Lisa Taouma (Director) Measina Samoa: Stories of the Malu 2003 The contemporary meanings and significance of malu are often vigorously contested and in recent years this has become especially noticeable in social media forums when tattooists and tattooed people share photographs of their tattoos. It is clear from these most public debates that the changes in meaning for all forms of Samoan tattooing are being made by the people who wear the images as much as the tattooists who create them.Mallon, S.

He was also Count of Bigorre and Viscount of Marsan through his marriage in 1196 to Petronilla, the daughter of Countess Stephanie-Beatrice of Bigorre. Coat of arms of the Viscounts of B√©arn from the 9th century, now in the mountains in southwest France Coat of arms of Bigorre, now in southwest France. The former lands of Foix, East of B√©arn and Bigorre, Southwest of France. Gaston was the son of ruling Viscountess Mary and William I of B√©arn. He was the elder of twins, his younger brother being the later viscount William Raymond. After their birth, in light of the conflict in B√©arn over the succession, Mary fled with them to the monastery of Santa Cruz de Volvestre. A Bearnese delegation reached the monastery in 1173 seeking one of the boys to be their viscount. Mary gave them Gaston, who was taken back to B√©arn to rule. During his minority, a council of regents from Aragon governed on his behalf. The council was led by Pelegrino de Castellarzuelo, lord of Barbastro. The period of the regency, however, is poorly documented. In 1187, when fourteen years old, Gaston was declared of age and paid homage to Alfonso II of Aragon at Huesca. Like most of the baronage of southern France, Gaston did not participate in the Third Crusade, because of the grand conflict between the crown of Aragon on the one hand and the county of Toulouse on the other. Gaston was firmly in the Aragonese camp. In 1194, a territorial dispute with the viscounty of Dax was resolved with the exchange of Mixe and Ostabarret, Ostabat, in return for the city of Orthez from Dax. In 1196, peace was also made with Soule. In that same year, he married Petronilla of Bigorre and thus made peace with all his neighbours. In 1208, Pope Innocent III ordered the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in southern France. Innocent ordered Gaston not to intervene against the crusaders, but Gaston took part in the relief of Toulouse from the besieging army of Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester in 1211. He also took part in the disastrous attack on Castelnaudary. However, neither of these acts were religiously based, as neither B√©arn nor Bigorre had many Cathars, but grounded rather in his loyalty to Peter II of Aragon, who was forced to come to the protection of his other vassals attacked by the crusaders. Gaston was attacked by the crusade nevertheless. Gaston lost Brulhois and was excommunicated by the Council of Vabres and his territories declared forfeit by the pope. On 15 January 1213, Gaston did homage to Peter II of Aragon along with Bernard IV of Comminges, (circa 1150 - Count 1175 - 22 February 1225), Raimond-Roger of Foix, and Raymond VI of Toulouse. Peter II thus intended to create a vast transpyrenean empire; however it was all undone at the Battle of Muret on 12 September. There Peter died in a losing cause because he had overconfidently neglected to summon his vassals with enough time for them all to arrive. Gaston was one of those who did not participate. Soon after the battle, however, Innocent III publicly pardoned the lords of B√©arn and Comminges. The only penance imposed upon Gaston was to give to the bishop two of the districts of the city of Oloron. In return, he also received back Brulhois. His loyalty to the king of Aragon, however, remained clearly expressed in the Llibre dels fets (chapt. 37). There he appears along with his brother at the side of the young king James I at the siege of Tamarite de Litera. Gaston died without issue in 1214 and was succeeded by his brother William Raymond. His widow retained Bigorre. Notes References  Further reading *Tucoo-Chala, Pierre. Quand l'Islam √©tait aux portes des Pyr√©n√©es.

Education and professional career Kleinfeld attended Wesleyan University (Bachelor of Arts, 1966) and Harvard Law School (Juris Doctor, 1969). After law school, he clerked for two years for Justice Jay Rabinowitz of the Supreme Court of Alaska. He served as Fairbanks's part- time magistrate for a short time, but was generally in private practice in Fairbanks until his elevation to the bench. =Personal= He is married to Professor Judith (Smilg) Kleinfeld. Federal judicial service After completing his clerkship, Kleinfeld served for three years as a part-time United States Magistrate of the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. He was nominated to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Alaska by President Ronald Reagan on March 26, 1986, confirmed by the United States Senate on May 14, 1986, and received his commission on May 15, 1986. His service terminated on October 7, 1991, due to elevation to the Ninth Circuit. On May 23, 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Kleinfeld to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, vacated by Judge Alfred T. Goodwin. He was confirmed by the Senate on September 12, 1991, and received his commission on September 16, 1991. He assumed senior status on June 12, 2010. Judicial philosophy Kleinfeld is generally considered a conservative judge, in contrast with the more liberal circuit he sits on. But his background in private practice as a civil and sometimes criminal defense lawyer gives him a more libertarian bent, as evidenced in his opinion in Calabretta v. Floyd and his dissent in U.S. v. Gourde =Involvement in Wal-Mart discrimination case= In 2007, a Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the class action certification in Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., a lawsuit initiated by female employees of Wal-Mart against the company for gender discrimination. Kleinfeld wrote a sharply worded dissent, saying \\"this case poses a considerable risk of enriching undeserving class members and counsel, but depriving thousands of women actually injured by sex discrimination of their just due.\\" =Free speech= Kleinfeld was the author of the unanimous panel decision of Morse v. Frederick, holding that a student who put up a banner supposedly supporting drug legalization was exercising his freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, and the school principal acted unconstitutionally in suspending him. The school board appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which heard the case on March 19, 2007. The Supreme Court, in a 2007 majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, reversed Kleinfeld's ruling and ruled that the First Amendment does not protect in-school student speech advocating illegal drug use. One key point of disagreement between Judge Kleinfeld's opinion and Chief Justice Roberts' was whether the speech was at or during school. As the banner was displayed across the street from the school (which had been let out for the day), Judge Kleinfeld's panel held that it was an \\"out of school\\" activity. Chief Justice Roberts' majority disagreed.

The Altavista petroglyph complex is located near the village and beach-town of Chacala, south of the Compostela Municipality, in Nayarit Mexico. The area is known as \\"La Pila del Rey\\", \\"Chacal√°n\\", \\"El Santuario\\", \\"The Petroglyphs‚Äù or \\"the Altavista petroglyphs\\", near the Jaltemba Bay, in the Pacific Ocean of Nayarit. This region was originally home to the largely unstudied Tecoxquin (Tequectequi) native culture dating from approximately 2000 BC to 2300 BCE. It contains 56 petroglyphs whose antiquity cannot be accurately determined. Aside from its cultural and archeological importance, the site remains an important religious center for the Huicholes who still leave offerings and perform ceremonies here. In prehispanic times, the Compostela municipality area was inhabited by the Mazat√°n peoples, tributary of Xalisco-Zacualpan Kingdom.COMPOSTELA Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M√©xico Nayarit (Spanish) Oct. 2010 Petroglyphs The Tecoxquines (Aztec Group) engraved images in volcanic stone over two thousand years ago near Las Piletas. These petroglyphs perhaps were symbolic elements of everyday life, as far as health, fertility, rains, and crops. The rock carvings might have been meant as prayers or offerings to the gods responsible for these things. There are fifteen signs (Spanish & English posted along entrance path, a brief summary is provided below: = Sign 1 - Altavista= Altavista petroglyphs archaeological site, located along the sides of a creek on the slopes the Copo volcano. Covers an area of approximately 80 hectares, with a large concentration of petroglyphs. (More than 2000 engravings identified) = Sign 2 - The Tecoxquin (Throat-Cutters) = Original Altavista inhabitants. This native group inhabited a vast region covering the South coast of Nayarit, neighbouring coasts, and mountainous regions of Jalisco, Mexico. They were mainly farmers, fishermen, salt producers and traders of cocoa and cotton. The Tecoxquines were organized in a number of villages under the control of Teuzacualpan Chila Valley (modern city of Zacualpan). Business links allowed them to develop an intensive trade, reached Sinaloa to the north and Colima and Michoac√°n to the South and East. =Sign 3 - Religious Life (Tecoxquines)= No doubt, many religious ceremonies at this site were based on nahualism. Nahualism or Shamanism as former religious practices whereby people communicated with their gods and spirits during altered states of consciousness. This tradition has deep roots in the region; the Nayarit word derives from the word \\"nahualli\\". The Tecoxquines used psychotropic plants and tobacco plants to achieve states of ecstasy and communicate with their gods. =Sign 4 - The Last of The Tecoxquines= Petroglyphs at Altavista Site, Compostela, Nayarit. After the Spanish conquest, the Tecoxquines completely annihilated by epidemics and forced labor. Today native cities of the region still talk about \\"white Indians,\\" ghosts appearing from the mountains to honor their ancient gods. =Sign 5 ‚Äì The Tecuales= The Tecoxquin ancient villages, as far as the Ixtapa salt producers, were populated by Tecuales, ancestors of the current Huichol. =Sign 6 - The Water Cycle = Nayarit State is characterized by heavy rainfall. Rainfall is concentrated between May and October. The Altavista mountains attract heavy rains leaving drier areas to the East (desert weather at the opposite side). Perhaps because of this abundance of water, Altavista was considered a special place. =Sign 7 - Tomoanchan (or Tamoanchan)= Tamoanchan is a mythical paradisiac location known to the Mesoamerican cultures of the central Mexican region in the Late Postclassical period, is a central part of the ancient Mesoamerican cosmology. Tamoanchan is the cosmic tree that connects life and supports the world. Its roots are underground in the water and fertility field. Its trunk is between human beings above ground and heavens. The Crown of the tree is in heaven, the kingdom of gods and rain. Tamoanchan was represented by the Ceiba tree. =Sign 8 - Warfare: Trophy Heads = The \\"Guerra Florida \\" (flower war) was one of the main religious practices associated with the Tecoxquines. The aim was not to conquer. Rather, get warriors prisoners for ritual sacrifice, and whose heads were cut and then offered to the gods. These wars were usually produced locally, but also conducted in places as far away as the Talpa and Mascota Valleys and Mochitiltic Canyon in Jalisco. =Sign 9 ‚Äì Tlalocan= water was thought to be underground in ancient Mesoamerica, hence the underworld was considered a fertile place. Tlalocan was the \\"water\\"paradise underground. It was inhabited by the ‚ÄúChanes‚Äù, or water spirits, as well as the spirits of people drowned or whose death was water related. Tlalocan also was the site of the legendary crocodile Cipactli,in Aztec mythology; Cipactli was a voracious, primitive and monstrous creature, half crocodile, half fish. It was always hungry, and in each joint of its 18 bodies had a mouth adorning it. Tezcatlipoca sacrificed a foot, using it as bait to attract it. It is also the first day of the sacred Aztec calendar, Tonalpohualli. a \\"earth monster\\", symbolizing fertility. =Sign 10 ‚Äì The Devoted Christ = The first historical references of the archaeological site of Altavista date from 1612. These describe many crosses, and above all, a devout Christ that local people venerates. This is possibly a reference to the \\"corn man\\", a figure that symbolizes fertility and growth. Local farmers leave offerings of candles and gourd bowls of salt to this figure in order to obtain fertility for their coffee and tobacco crops. =Sign 11 ‚Äì The Apostle Matthew = During the early 17TH century, Spaniards believed that the Apostle Matthew traveled to the new world in prehispanic times to evangelize natives. This is thought to explain the crosses engraved in the Altavista rocks. =Sign 12 ‚Äì The Cross = For Tecoxquines, as well as for most ancient Mesoamerican, the cross actually was a mental map of the cosmos. Symbolizes five sacred directions: the four cardinal points and the center. Each is associated with certain gods, colors, and sacred kingdoms, as well as each of the four trees that formed the tamoanchan kingdoms. The idea of the universe of four corners is still present among native Mexico today, symbolized by crosses, diamonds and other similar forms. =Sign 13 ‚Äì Communication With The Gods = The Altavista rocks were probably associated with the mythical Tamoanchan trees connecting the underworld, earth and heaven. The prayers of the people went up through the sap of the trunks into the realm of the gods. In turn, the gifts of the gods, rain, fertility and good health returned to land the same way. For the Tecoxquines the Altavista rocks would have served the same purpose, a means of communication between the people and their gods. =Sign 14 ‚Äì Tecoxquin Symbolism = Spirals, wavy lines, and other symbols carved in the Altavista rocks probably constitute a ritual prayer language for the gods. As an agricultural culture, the Tocoxquines would have been concerned with rain, fertility of the land and the continuity of the seasonal rhythms that they relied on. While the exact meaning of symbols will never be known, spirals have been interpreted as the Sun, storm, the wind, the spiral snake, or as a symbol of the natural cycle of station rainy and dry. =Sign 15 ‚ÄìHuichol Offerings= Huichol natives occasionally visit Altavista originally lived in the Nayar mountains, recently a group moved to the Las Varas area. They present offerings and perform ceremonies for Nakahue, \\"our fertility grandmother\\" and Tatevari, \\"our grandfather of fire\\". Some Huicholes also travel to the nearby Chacala Port, where ancient petroglyphs are present and leave offerings for Tatei Aramara ‚Äúour mother Ocean‚Äù.

The incidents  The Carlists, a counter-revolutionary monarchist movement that joined the alliance of Nationalists supporting Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), had split between its more traditional, counter-revolutionary, Ancien R√©gime, Catholic, anti-capitalistic, anti- socialistic, pro-legitimate monarchist adherents and the new confederal, socialist, autogestionary movement modeled after Titoist ideology. The new Titoist half of the movement was the target of a violent incident organized by Franco's supporters, informally known as the bunker, who still controlled the State apparatus. Ricardo Garc√≠a Pellejero and Aniano Jim√©nez Santo, two supporters of Carlist pretender Carlos-Hugo de Borb√≥n-Parma, were murdered by far-right gunmen.\\"Two slain at Carlist rally\\", Facts on File World News Digest, June 12, 1976 At the time of the events, the British magazine The Economist speculated about possible Government involvement in the events: > The region is so tightly policed that opposition parties find it difficult > to hold even small private meetings.

It is commonly accepted that high-rank Guardia Civil officials, as well as the SECED (CESID's predecessor), supported the conspiracy (code-named Operaci√≥n Reconquista).

It is driven by the fact that heated water diffuses more readily than salty water. A small parcel of warm, salty water sinking downwards into a colder, fresher region will lose its heat before losing its salt, making the parcel of water increasingly denser than the water around it and sinking further. Likewise, a small parcel of colder, fresher water will be displaced upwards and gain heat by diffusion from surrounding water, which will then make it lighter than the surrounding waters, and cause it to rise further. Paradoxically, the fact that salinity diffuses less readily than temperature means that salinity mixes more efficiently than temperature due to the turbulence caused by salt fingers. Salt fingering was first described mathematically by Professor Melvin Stern of Florida State University in 1960 and important field measurements of the process have been made by Raymond Schmitt of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Mike Gregg and Eric Kunze of the University of Washington, Seattle. A particularly interesting area for salt fingering is found in the Caribbean Sea, where it is responsible for producing a \\"staircase\\" of well- mixed layers a few metres in thickness that extend for hundreds of kilometres. Pre-dating the work of Stern, a paper by the American oceanographer Henry Stommel discussed the creation of a large-scale salt finger in which a column of water would be surrounded by a membrane that would allow diffusion of temperature but not salinity.

The piece was first performed on September 25, 1920 in Pittsfield, Massachusetts; it won the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Award. The piece takes its title from two early forms of Italian poetry; rispetti were love messages from men to ladies, while strambotti were roundelays. The piece is a single, coherent work meant to depict various aspects of the Renaissance, and is built up of numerous episodic melodic subjects. Among the most significant are those depicting the clergy and peasantry; the former is a sort of plainchant, while the latter is a robust theme with astringent harmonies.

Reverse side says \\"Presented to Charles B. King, Umpire by H. Mueller Mfg. Co. Decatur, Ill.\\" Motocycle was a word used in the United States in the later 19th century for a horseless carriage, the type of vehicle now known as a car or automobile. The word caught on initially as it was short and easier to understand than other possibilities, such as \\"automobile carriage\\", \\"motor carriage\\", \\"motor vehicle\\", or \\"auto carriage\\".Sturmey, p. 67 It is now archaic and rarely used. The term \\"motor vehicle\\" is currently used in legal, transportation planning and academic terminology.  First uses  One of the first publications of the word \\"motocycle\\" in the United States was when The Chicago Times-Herald reported on November 29, 1895, of America's first automobile race the day before It turns out that Herman H. Kohlsaat, owner of the Times-Herald, and Frederick Upham Adams, a local writer with a mechanical engineering interest, ran a public contest for someone to come up with a unique name to replace \\"horseless carriage\\" that represented the new motorized transport. The $500 prize for the new name went to the general manager of the New York Telephone Company for the name \\"motocycle\\" in 1895.The Chicago Times- Herald, July 25, 1895 He suggested the name \\"motocycle\\" as being as close to a correct definition as sounding good to defining exactly what it was. He is credited as the first to coin this name that would replace \\"horseless carriage.\\" It was used then for reports on The Times-Herald's first automobile race.King, p. 18 The name received little public enthusiasm and by the end of the nineteenth century went into discontinuance.  Later uses  Starting in the twentieth century the name \\"automobile\\" became popular instead of motocycle in the United States and in Great Britain the motocycle became \\"motorcar\\" or \\"autocar\\".May, p. 26World Book, p. 138McComb, p. 6 Charles Brady King intended to enter a \\"horseless carriage\\" in the 1895 Times-Herald race, but wrote to Adams that although he intended to enter a motocycle with four wheels and a 4-horsepower 100-pound engine, it wasn't quite ready and he would have to withdraw.May, George S., Encyclopedia..., pp. 286-293 His motocycle could carry four persons, but for the race there would have been only two in the vehicle to reduce the weight and gain speed. His lightweight motocycle came in at 675 pounds, could seat four people plus cargo, and would probably sell for about $600 in a large quantity production. His motocycle dream, however, did not flourish and was realized by Ford and Olds instead.May, p. 27 On September 11 (1895), King advised the Chicago Times-Herald that although he was \\"using all haste\\", it did not seem likely he could complete his motocycle by November 2. In 1898 \\"Modern machinery\\" magazine pointed out the merits of gasoline-, electric- and steam-propelled 4-wheeled motocycles (automobiles).Modern machinery, Volumes 3-4, pp. 589-591  Legal  The term \\"motor vehicle\\" is defined in legal terms as most self-powered vehicles (i.e. automobiles, motorcycles, trucks, recreational vehicles) on public highways, no matter how many wheels it has or how many passengers it can carry or how much freight it can transport.

The work has received praise from The New York Times Book Review, Spin, Wired, and acclaimed comics creator Chris Ware.\\"Jar of Fools\\" webpage at Drawn and Quarterly's website. Jar of Fools is the story of a tormented magician named Ernie Weiss (likely based on Harry Houdini, whose name was originally Ehrich Weiss\\"Fools of Wisdom\\" - An article on Metroactive Books about Jar of Fools.). His brother, Howard, has died and he has become estranged from his girlfriend, Esther O'Dea. The story of the comic retells Ernie's struggles to get himself back on track and find himself, in part through the guidance of Al Flosso (likely also based on a real magician of the same name\\"Al Flosso\\" at the Magic Directory.). The strip first ran weekly in The Stranger, a weekly Seattle alternative newspaper. Lutes self-published a collection of strips at first, but in 1994, Black Eye Productions released the series in a two-part collected anthology. The book was then published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2003, where Lutes also released his Berlin series. Jar of Fools was one of Lutes's first mainstream successes, earning him praise from many publications. Chris Ware, one of the most popular alternative comics writers, said of Jar of Fools: \\"Reading Jar of Fools is like getting a slow motion punch in the face. There‚Äôs plenty of time to get out of the way, but something compels you to wait and find out if it‚Äôs actually going to hurt as much when it hits.

His command was however short lived. The regimental officers regarded his orders as bizarre and a deputation of mid ranking officers approached him on behalf of all the officers with the request that, as they had no confidence in him, Tudor should resign his command. Tudor refused and the brigade commander, on being informed by the regimental padre of the toxic situation that existed in the regiment when a major battle was in the offing, dismissed Tudor who was replaced on 8th October 1941 by Lieutenant Colonel Sir Peter Farquhar.

He was nicknamed \\"the Benjamin Franklin of Medicine\\" by contemporaries for his leadership and writing on a wide range of medical and political topics. Dr. Harris' most celebrated accomplishments were his 1924 hypothesis of hyperinsulinism as a cause of spontaneous hypoglycemia. Life Harris received a medical degree from the University of Virginia in 1894 and established a medical practice in Union Springs, Alabama. After the completion of postgraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Harris accepted the position of Professor of Clinical Medicine at the Medical College of Alabama in Mobile. During World War I, Harris was commissioned as a major in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and served with distinction. Returning to private practice in Birmingham, Dr. Harris was instrumental in building the 50-bed Gorgas Hospital Hotel which later became Montclair Baptist Medical Center. A prolific author and contributor to medical literature, he advocated a national Department of Health, improved nutrition, and attention to diabetes mellitus. He was instrumental in establishing a camp near Mobile for children with diabetes. In tribute to his life and work, it was later designated Camp Seale Harris.Camp Seale Harris from Liteforlife He opened the Seale Harris Clinic in Birmingham in 1922. The clinic and name are perpetuated by his successors. Shortly after the discovery of insulin in 1922, Harris visited Canada to study diabetes cases with the scientists who discovered the hormone. These studies led to research on the effects in nondiabetic patients of an excessive secretion of insulin and his recognition that hyperinsulinism could cause hypoglycemia, a deficiency of sugar in the blood. His research on hyperinsulinism and its control brought international recognition to Harris, including the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest scientific award of the American Medical Association. While serving in the Army during World War I, he edited the journal War Medicine, published in Paris. For 12 years he was the owner and editor of the Southern Medical Journal. His writings include more than 100 contributions to the medical literature and books in such diverse fields as clinical practice, biography and politics. Widely respected among doctors, Harris served at as president of the Southern Medical Association, Medical Association of the State of Alabama, and the American Medical Editors Association. Harris' syndrome Harris' syndrome is a historical term for hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, such as that caused by insulin-producing tumors of the pancreas (insulinoma). The syndrome is characterized by the symptoms of low blood sugar: weakness, hunger, shakiness, increasing nervousness, mild mental confusion or even personality alterations with erratic behaviour, and the adrenergic responses of tachycardia, pallor, and sweating. The concept of the syndrome was postulated by Harris, in 1924, after he observed hypoglycemia produced during treatment of diabetic patients with the newly discovered insulin. The reception of Harris‚Äôs findings were recounted by William Dufty:William Dufty (1975) Sugar Blues, pages 81 to 90 :After the discovery of insulin in 1924, \\"doctors and patients experimenting with insulin in its early years took too little or too much. An overdose produced symtopms of what has come to be called insulin shock. Dr Seale Harris of the University of Alabama began to notice symptoms of insulin shock in many people who were neither diabetic nor taking any insulin. These people were diagnosed as having low levels of glucose in their blood; diabetics have high levels of glucose.\\" :The remedy was self-government of the body. The patient with low blood glucose must be prepared to give up refined sugar, candy, coffee and soft drinks ‚Äì these items had caused the troubles...Hyperinsulinism or low blood glucose therapy was a do-it-yourself proposition. Seale Harris was awarded the 1949 Distinguished Service Medal of the American Medical Association.AMA Awards, from American Medical Association Harris was posthumously elected in 1965 to the Alabama Hall of Fame. Dr. Stephen Gyland of Tampa, Florida, suffered from hyperinsulinism and happened on Harris's article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. He wrote a letter to the JournalStephen Gyland (1953) \\"Possibly Neurogenic Hypoglycemia\\", Journal of the American Medical Association 152: 1184, ¬ß \\"Queries and Minor Notes\\", July 18 praising Harris and describing his long search for a diagnosis and treatment before finding Harris's study. Military career With the advent of World War I, and with a commission of major in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army, Dr. Harris was assigned to the staff of general William Crawford Gorgas. While serving overseas he was decorated for meritorious service by general John J. Pershing. Seale Harris Award This award, named in honor of Seale Harris and established in 1958 at the Southern Medical Association meeting in New Orleans, is presented annually to a member of the Southern Medical Association in recognition of important research accomplishments in the broad field of metabolism, endocrinology, or nutrition, or for significant accomplishments contributing to a better understanding of the chemical changes occurring in disease.

It sits on several-blocks along the Olentangy River, and is the western part of the Near Northside Historic District. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The character of the neighborhood is similar to Victorian Village, which sits just to the east and is a little more well-known. History Harrison West was established in the late 1800s and early 1900s on farmland that was first plowed by veterans of the Revolutionary War. It features \\"brick streets, housing built by craftsmen for workers in nearby factories and fine examples of turn-of-the-century American town planning and architecture.\\" The Harrison West neighborhood area experienced urban decline throughout much of the late 20th century. Just south of Harrison West, the similar \\"Flytown\\" was destroyed during \\"slum clearance\\" in the 1960s and replaced by Interstate 670 and the \\"James Thurber Village\\" apartment and business area. Redevelopment and gentrification, spreading from Victorian Village closer to downtown, has transformed the area in the last two decades, accelerating with the demolition of industrial sites along the Olentangy River. =The Harrison West Society= In response to the decline of neighborhood in the 1970s, unscrupulous landlords, and mass demolition of housing, the residents of Harrison West organized the Harrison West Society ‚Äúto preserve and improve the neighborhood‚Äù and to ‚Äúbroaden the appreciation of ethnic and social heritage with friendly contact.‚Äù When a shopping mall was proposed to be developed in the neighborhood, the Society worked to turn the proposal back. This started a new era in Harrison West that promoted public and private investment and sense of community, which gave the neighborhood a chance to recover and thrive. The Harrison West Society continues today on as a nonprofit civic association, and in the last decade, it has made many improvements to the neighborhood. Some examples of work they have done are planting street trees, securing architectural improvements to the Third Avenue bridge, establishing four community parks (Wheeler Park, Harrison Park, Side- by-Side Park, and Harrison West Park), pushing for traffic calming measures to protect pedestrians, hosting potlucks and other social events, arranging improved alley and street lighting, organizing a public art project, sponsoring zoning changes, helping to shape a comprehensive plan, and working to reduce crime. Geography The area is bounded by Harrison Avenue on the east (which runs parallel to Neil Avenue), Goodale Street on the south, 5th Avenue on the north, and Olentangy River Road to the west (including \\"Gowdy Field\\"). In January 2008, the neighborhood expanded to include all of \\"Thurber Village\\" to the south east. Demographics Harrison West has a population of 1,347 whereas Columbus has a population of 837,038. That means 0.16% of Columbus's population resides in Harrison West. The median age in Columbus is 32.1 while in Harrison West it is 31.7. The population density in Harrison West is 6,716 per square mile, whereas in Columbus it is 3,829 per square mile. Harrison West skews more male, with a male to female ratio of 1.5:1, compared to the 1.0:1 ratio of Columbus as a whole. In Harrison West, 88.24% of the population is white, while in Columbus that percent is only 61.12%. African Americans form the next largest racial group in Harrison West at 7.39% of the population, although they make up 27.96% of Columbus's population. Transportation Harrison West is about two and a half miles from the city of Columbus. Even though the neighborhood is that close to the city itself, 81% of all traveling uses a car. Only 3% of all transportation uses some form of public transportation. The average one way travel time to work is 10‚Äì19 minutes driving. More than 80% of the population of West Harrison spend less than 29 minutes one way driving to work. Structures and Landmarks Some of the highlights of the neighborhood include public art and several parks. The Olentangy River runs through the neighborhood providing access to the Olentangy Recreation Trail, which stretches from downtown to north of I-270 in Worthington. The Third Avenue business district also boasts two caf√©s. =Parks= #Battelle Green Space- The Battelle Green Space is private property at the corner of West Third Avenue and Perry Street that Battelle generously allows the community to use. It includes a public walkway connecting Perry Street to the Olentangy Recreation Trail. #Harrison Park- This is the newest park in Harrison West, and is located on Harrison Park Place between West First and West Second avenues. It features a segment of the Olentangy Recreation Trail, park benches, refuse cans and attractive lighting, wrought iron picnic tables with benches, an handicap-accessible gazebo designed to host events, a playground including areas for older children and younger children, four public art pieces designed by Columbus College of Art and Design students, and open grass fields. #Harrison West Park- Harrison West Park is a pocket park located in the northern half of Harrison West on Oregon Street at Fourth Avenue. It is the oldest park in the neighborhood and is surrounded by homes. #Side by Side Park- Side by Side Park is nestled between residences on the south side of West Third Avenue and the Olentangy River, and is the gateway from Harrison West to the Olentangy Recreation Trail. #Wheeler Dog Park- Wheeler Park is in the southern half of Harrison West, one block west of Neil Avenue on Thurber Drive West. It is Columbus's first dog park and is entirely enclosed by fencing. Land Use and Zoning New homes in Harrison West The majority of Harrison West is residential, but more recently, efforts have been made to expand on and add variety to the neighborhood's land us and zoning. In September 2005, council adopted the Harrison West Plan. It originally served as a revision of the Harrison West Reach Section of the Columbus Riverfront Vision Plan, but ended up becoming the neighborhood's own, first ever official community plan. The Harrison West Plan recommended that the neighborhood continue the development patterns that gave Harrison West its unique character, and in addition, more residential development, retail development, office and light industrial development, and parkland were all been proposed. The Harrison West Plan was implemented to ensure that the neighborhood could retain its charm and character, but could also continue to be regarded as one of the Columbus's most vibrant and desirable neighborhoods. Entertainment While not directly in Harrison West, there are many entertainment spots within walking distance of the neighborhood. The Arena District is located 1.6 miles away and has many types of recreation. There are 14 restaurants and bars, an 11-screen movie theater, a skating rink and music pavilion. Goodale Park is considered to be Columbus' oldest park and it is located only 0.8 miles away. The park was donated by Dr. Lincoln Goodale; on July 14, 1851 Dr. Goodale donated 40 acres for strictly public use. Today it is surrounded by Victorian Village and is home to many events including ComFest, a very large and free music and arts festival. Huntington Park is home to the Columbus Clippers minor league baseball team and is only 1.4 miles away. There is also Nationwide Arena, home to the Columbus Blue Jackets hockey team, which is a mere 1.4 miles away. Finally Harrison West is only 0.9 miles away from the Short North Arts District. This strip going from The Ohio State University to downtown Columbus is one of the most popular destinations for local art and entertainment in the country. Education Harrison Wests' graduation rates are much higher than both the averages of Columbus and that of Ohio. 88.2% graduate high school, where the average in Ohio is 84.2%. In Harrison West, 57.5% complete a bachelor's degree, compared to Ohio where only 24.7% complete it. The difference is again double, as 18.2% of people complete a master's degree in Harrison West, but only 9.1% in Ohio as a whole.

History An 1850 view of the Largo de S√£o Gon√ßalo A view of the church and monastery of Amarante alongside the T√¢mega River in 1910 Amarante's origin dates to the primitive peoples that hunted and gathered in the Serra da Aboboreira, sometime during the Stone Age, and extended during the Bronze Age and later the Romanization of the Iberian peninsula. The first prominent building erected during the area of Amarante was likely the Albergaria do Covelo do T√¢mega sometime in the 12th century, by order of Queen D. Mafalda, wife of D. Afonso Henriques. These types of shelter were constructed in small settlements and were used by travellers, especially the poor who transited the territory. Permanent settles fixed themselves around the local churches, such as the Church of S√£o Ver√≠ssimo and Church of Lufrei, resulting in growth during the intervening years. The urban agglomeration of Amarante became important and gained visibility with the arrival of Gon√ßalo (1187-1259) a Dominican friar who was born in Tagilde (Guimar√£es), who settled in the area following a pilgrimage to Rome and Jerusal√©m. He was instrumental in the development of the region, with many local structures attributed to his efforts, including the construction of the stone bridge across the T√¢mega River. Following his death, Amarante became the destination of pilgrimages and grew substantially. In the 16th century, King D. John III expanded the local church and resulting in its conversion into a large Dominican monastery. The bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1763 and was rebuilt. In the second French invasion, during the Peninsular War, French forces commanded by Marshall Soult, found themselves at the bridge over the T√¢mega, and needed to secure their connection to Spain, while advancing from Porto to Marco de Canaveses through Amarante. Soult, realizing that Beresford's Portuguese and English forces were advancing on him, sent a column to the T√¢mega valley, in order to prepare the way for a new column. Under the column, commanded by Loison, through looting, skirmishes and unsuccessful attempts to cross the river, entered in Amarante on 18 April 1809, having looted and burned down the villages of Vila Me√£, Manhufe and Pidre. In the village they continue to loot and burn down buildings, except for larger family residences, which were left intact and destined to function as the French headquarters and field hospitals. There are still vestiges of these events, including those in the Estate of Magalh√£es, the facade of the Church of S√£o Gon√ßalo, the perforated tiles in the sacristy and the damaged pyramids on the bridge. The bridge was also significant to the resistance in the northern campaign. Loison did not count on the entrenched conflict between his forces and the Anglo-Portuguese forces, commanded by Brigadier Silveira. These forces, which included badly-equipped, inexperienced citizens and clergy, were able to resist for the next 14 days, impeding the passage of Napoleonic forces, later known as the heroic defense of the bridge of Amarante. The circlement of the bridge ended on 2 May, around 3:00, following a diversionary manoeuvre by French forces that diverted a small pocket of Portuguese stationed at Eira do Pa√ßo, who believed the French would attempt to across by Morleiros. Taking advantage of the fog, the French placed gunpowder near the Portuguese trenches along the bridge, then detonated the explosives. These created confusion and panic among the defenders and caused death and injury in their ranks. Loison then continued his journey, until he was forced to withdrew in the upper Douro by Brigadier Silveira's forces, who he had reorganized, during Napoleon's northern march to the city of Lisbon. For his efforts, Silveira was given a cavalry command, owing to his defense of the bridge, and attributed the title of Count of Amarante and elevated to the status of General. The town was also awarded the Order of the Tower and Sword, which it displays on its coats-of-arms. The municipality of Amarante, administratively, was part of the Minho Province, and abutted the municipalities of Celorico de Basto (to the north), Gesta√ßo (in the east), Gouveia (in the south) and Santa Cruz de Riba T√¢mega (in the west). With administrative reforms during the 19th century, the municipalities of Gouveia, Gesta√ßo and Santa Cruz de Ribat√¢mega were extinguished, and many of the local parishes were absorbed into the Amarante. Geography A view of the landscape of the town of Amarante in 1900 Amarante is situated in the agricultural lands of the Minho region, and belongs to the Porto district, region Norte and sub-region T√°mega. The T√¢mega River runs through the town and is crossed by a large arched bridge, the Ponte S√£o Gon√ßalo. It is reputed to have helped local forces fend off a French attack in the early 19th century. Nowadays the older centre of town is dominated by a multitude of caf√©s and restaurants dotted along the steep banks of the southern side of the T√¢mega River. Amarante is also associated with the tale of Saint Gonzalo/Gon√ßalo de Amarante. The overhang homes located in the central community of S√£o Gon√ßalo, Madalena, Cepelos e Gat√£o Covelo do Monte in the parish of Aboadela Administratively, the municipality is divided into 26 civil parishes: * Aboadela, Sanche e V√°rzea * Amarante (S√£o Gon√ßalo), Madalena, Cepelos e Gat√£o * Ansi√£es * Bustelo, Carneiro e Carvalho de Rei * Candemil * Figueir√≥ (Santiago e Santa Cristina) * Fregim * Freixo de Cima e de Baixo * Frid√£o * Gondar * Jazente * Lomba * Louredo * Lufrei * Mancelos * Olo e Canadelo * Padronelo * Real, Ata√≠de e Oliveira * Rebordelo * Salvador do Monte * S√£o Sim√£o de Gouveia * Tel√µes * Travanca * Vila Caiz * Vila Ch√£ do Mar√£o * Vila Garcia, Aboim e Chapa International Relations =Twin towns ‚Äî Sister cities= Horta is twinned with: * Wiesloch, Germany * Ch√¢teauneuf-sur-Loire, France * Ach√®res, France Economy On the abandoned T√¢mega railway line between Amarante and Chapa Stations, the Council of Amarante built the ÀùEcopistaÀù pathway for bicycles and pedestrians. The T√¢mega Line Ecotrack is long and wide, running very close to the T√°mega River. The Amarante Golf Course, designed by Portuguese architect Jorge Santana da Silva, lies in Quinta da Deveza and was founded in 1997. It is an 18-hole, par 68 course with a total length of 5.030 metres. It is located in the Fregim parish, around from the town of Amarante. Amarante lies around half a kilometre from the A4 Motorway. There is also a bus station, served principally by Rodonorte, to the south of the T√°mega river. Between 1909 and 2009 Amarante was served by a narrow gauge railway line, which connected with the main Douro Valley railway line at Livra√ßao. Amarante station and the entire T√¢mega line closed in 2009. Architecture The monastery and bridges attributed and dedicated to Gon√ßalo de Amarante The architecture of the Amarante region is mainly in the Romanesque style, with a number of Romanesque monuments (colonnades, arches, tympana and columns) throughout the region. They were built in deserted areas or on crossroads on the outskirts of inhabited areas, serving as meeting places, accommodation and defensive positions. Amarante became part of the Sousa Valley Romanesque Route (Rota do Rom√¢nico) project on the 12 March 2010.Amarante, Testimony of History, Romanesque Municipio de Amarante Important religious buildings can be found to the north of the T√¢mega, and include the Travanca monastery, the Mancelos church, the Tel√µes church, the Freixo de Baixo monastery and the Gat√£o church. On the southern side of the river, can be found the Jazente church, the Lufrei church and the Gondar monastery which are in a more modest style. * Church of Salvador () * Church of Santa Maria () * Church of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista () * Convent of S√£o Gon√ßalo de Amarante () * Monastery of Divino Salvador () * Monastery of Gondar () * Monastery of Lufrei () * Monastery of Mancelos () * Monastery of Tel√µes () * Monastery of S√£o Salvador de Travanca () Notable citizens St. Gon√ßalo cakes named, ironically, for the Gon√ßalo de Amarante * Gon√ßalo de Amarante (1187 - 10 January 1259), Roman Catholic priest and a professed member of the Order of Preachers.

Captured by the Germans during the 1940 invasion of Norway and renamed Togo, she was returned to the Norwegians in 1946. Otra remained in service until being sold for scrapping in 1963. Description Otra and her sister ship Rauma were two purpose-built minesweepers constructed at Nylands Verksted in Oslo. Both ships were completed and commissioned only a short time before the German invasion of Norway. The Otra class vessels used the Oropesa system of mine sweeping. As the threat of war in Europe became ever more clear the decision was made to improve the Royal Norwegian Navy's mine warfare capabilities. At first a number of 2. class gunboats were rebuilt into minelayers and mine sweepers, but with war looming it soon became clear that more capable vessels were required. The invasion =Prelude= Shortly before the German invasion the UK announced that the Royal Navy had laid a number of minefields along the coast of Norway to interfere with the German import of Swedish iron ore through the North Norwegian port of Narvik. The British government claimed to have mined three areas; off Stad, Hustadvika, and Landegode north of Bod√∏. In response to this report, the Norwegian government ordered the minesweepers Otra and Rauma to sail north from their base in Horten and sweep the minefields on 9 April 1940. Otra during tests at Nylands Verksted shipyard in December 1939 =Otra spots the invasion force= Before the order to go north could be carried out, however, the German invasion of Norway took place in the early hours of 9 April. As reports of intruding warships started coming in Otra was sent out to investigate, and at 0410hrs report that the intruders were Germans. The invasion flotilla blocked Otras return to Horten. =Capture= While her sister ship, HNoMS Rauma, was fighting the German naval forces in Horten Otra was cut off and isolated from the action. The next morning, 10 April, she was captured while at anchor in Filtvet. German service as Togo After capture Otra was renamed Togo and put in service as a Vorpostenboot and minelayer for the rest of the war. First NT 05 Togo served in as part of Hafenschutzflotille Troms√∏ guarding that northern city's harbour. Later she was transferred to Hafenschutzflottille Oslo. On 21 September 1941, Togo was in collision with the minesweeper off Hammerfest. Also in 1941, she became part of 59th Vorpostenflottille as V 5908 Togo, where she served until April 1944 when she transferred to 65th Vorpostenflottille as V 6512 Togo. After the German surrender she was part of the German Mine Sweeping Administration (GM-SA). Post-war service On 18 January 1946 Togo was returned to the Royal Norwegian Navy at Bogen and on 30 October 1946 was renamed HNoMS Otra. In April 1949 she was rebuilt as a minelayer training ship. 21 August 1959 saw her decommissioning and she was laid up at Horten until put out of service and sold in April 1963.

The most common example is in a vehicle's suspension, where it is used to describe the displacement and forces in the springs and shock absorbers. The force in the spring is (roughly) the vertical force at the contact patch divided by the motion ratio, and the spring rate is the wheel rate divided by the motion ratio squared. :IR = \\\\frac{Spring Displacement}{Wheel Displacement}.MR = \\\\frac{Wheel Displacement}{Spring Displacement}. :Wheel rate = {Spring rate}*{IR^2}.Wheel rate = {Spring rate}/{MR^2}. This is described as the Installation Ratio in the reference. Motion ratio is the more common term in the industry, but sometimes is used to mean the inverse of the above definition. Motion ratio in suspension of a vehicle describes the amount of shock travel for a given amount of wheel travel. Mathematically it is the ratio of shock travel and wheel travel. The amount of force transmitted to the vehicle chassis reduces with increase in motion ratio. A motion ratio close to one is desired in vehicle for better ride and comfort. One should know the desired wheel travel of the vehicle before calculating motion ratio which depends much on the type of track the vehicle will run upon. Selecting the appropriate ratio depends on multiple factors: #Bending moment: To reduce the bending moment the strut point should be close to the wheel. #Suspension stiffness: Suspensions tends to stiffen when the inclination of the shock absorber to horizontal tends to 90 deg. #Half-shafts: In rear suspensions, wheel travel is constrained by the universal joints of the half shafts. Design the motion ratio such that at maximum bounce and rebound shocks are the first components that bottom out by hitting bump stops.

It was founded in 1865 by William Carter. Carter's sells its products through its own Carter's and OshKosh B'gosh retail stores, its website, and in other retail outlets such as department stores. , it was reported that Carter's accounted for around one- quarter of all sales both for the children's sleepwear market, and for clothes for the newborn to two-year-old age group. History William Carter was the founder of William Carter Company in 1865 in Needham, Massachusetts. William Carter (1830‚Äì1918) was born in Alfreton, Derbyshire, England. He arrived in America on January 28, 1857. He married Martha Lee (1842-1873). They had four children: William Henry Carter (1864‚Äì1955), who served two terms in the U.S. House of Representatives (1915-1919) prior to being elected president of the William Carter Company in 1918; Mary Elizabeth Carter (1865-1961); John J. Carter (1867-1939); and Horace A. Carter (1869-1959). By the early 1960s, the William Carter Company manufactured at seven mills in Massachusetts and the South. The Carter family sold the business in 1990. In the early 2000s, Carter's reached an agreement with Target Corporation to create the \\"Just One You\\" spin-off clothing line, to be sold exclusively in Target stores. Carter's later created exclusive lines for retailers Walmart and Amazon. All of the brands sell similar articles of clothing, such as bodysuits, pajamas, and dresses, but each has its own design team and pricing policies specific to the retailer. Carter's acquired competitor OshKosh B'gosh for $312 million in 2005. In 2012, Carter's, Inc. announced that Braselton, Georgia would receive their 1-million-square-foot, $50 million distribution center that will support their e-commerce, retail, and wholesale businesses. The company hoped to create 1,000 jobs at the facility by 2015. In February 2017, Carter's, Inc. acquired Skip Hop Inc., an infant and child product company based in New York, for $140 million in cash and up to $10 million in future payments contingent on reaching certain financial goals in 2017.Fireman Capital Partners, a private equity firm, had previously acquired a majority equity stake in Skip Hop Inc. for $50 million in November 2013. In addition to selling its apparel through third-party retailers, Carter's operated 1,060 branded stores and outlets , with plans to open up to another 100 stores in \\"mid-tier\\" shopping malls in the following years. A market research firm found that \\"Ninety percent of millennial parents ‚Äî and 80 percent of baby boomer grandparents ‚Äî have shopped at Carter‚Äôs in the past year.\\"  Brands  Carter's, Inc. markets clothing and other children's products under several brand names. Other than its namesake Carter's brand, OshKosh B'gosh, and Skip Hop, these labels are exclusive to specific retailers and include, : * Exclusive to Target Corporation stores: ** Just One You ** Precious Firsts ** Genuine Kids * Exclusive to Walmart: ** Child of Mine * Exclusive to Amazon: ** Simple Joys The logo for each exclusive brand notes that it is \\"made by Carter's,\\" with the exception of Genuine Kids, which carries the label \\"from OshKosh.\\" Genuine Kids has been sold since 2003, before OshKosh was acquired by Carters, Inc.

Function  Annexin A1 belongs to the annexin family of Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins that have a molecular weight of approximately 35,000 to 40,000 Dalton and are preferentially located on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. Annexin A1 protein has an apparent relative molecular mass of 40 kDa with phospholipase A2 inhibitory activity.  Clinical significance  = Effect on innate and adaptive immunity= Glucocorticoids (such as budesonide, cortisol, and beclomethasone) are a class of endogenous or synthetic anti-inflammatory steroid hormones that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. They are used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system, including allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and sepsis. Because they suppress inflammatory pathways, long-term use of glucocorticoid drugs can lead to side-effects such as immunodeficiency and adrenal insufficiency. The main mechanism of glucocorticoids' anti- inflammatory effects is to increase the synthesis and function of annexin A1. Annexin A1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking eicosanoid production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis at the level of phospholipase A2 as well as at the level of cyclooxygenase/PGE isomerase (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, potentiating the anti-inflammatory effect. In resting conditions, human and mouse immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages contain high levels of annexin A1 in their cytoplasm. Following cell activation (for example, by neutrophil adhesion to endothelial-cell monolayers), annexin A1 is promptly mobilized to the cell surface and secreted. Annexin A1 promotes neutrophil detachment and apoptosis, and phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils by macrophages. On the other hand, it reduces the tendency of neutrophils to penetrate the endothelium of blood vessels. In vitro and in vivo analyses show that exogenous and endogenous annexin A1 counter-regulate the activities of innate immune cells, particularly extravasation and the generation of proinflammatory mediators, which ensures that a sufficient level of activation is reached but not exceeded. Annexin A1 has important opposing properties during innate and adaptive immune responses: it inhibits innate immune cells and promotes T-cell activation. The activation of T cells results in the release of annexin A1 and the expression of its receptor. This pathway seems to fine-tune the strength of TCR signalling. Higher expression of annexin A1 during pathological conditions could increase the strength of TCR signalling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway, thereby causing a state of hyperactivation of T cells. = Inflammation = Since phospholipase A2 is required for the biosynthesis of the potent mediators of inflammation, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, annexin A1 may have potential anti-inflammatory activity. Glucocorticoids stimulate production of lipocortin. In this way, synthesis of eicosanoids are inhibited. = Cancer = Annexin A1 has been of interest for use as a potential anticancer drug. Upon induction by modified NSAIDS and other potent anti-inflammatory drugs, annexin A1 inhibits the NF-Œ∫B signal transduction pathway, which is exploited by cancerous cells to proliferate and avoid apoptosis. ANXA1 inhibits the activation of NF-Œ∫B by binding to the p65 subunit.  Leukemia  The gene for annexin A1 (ANXA1) is upregulated in hairy cell leukemia. ANXA1 protein expression is specific to hairy cell leukemia. Detection of ANXA1 (by immunocytochemical means) reportedly provides a simple, highly sensitive, and specific assay for the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia.  Breast cancer  Altered annexin A1 expression levels through modulation of the immune system effects the initiation and spread of breast cancer, but the association is complex and conclusions of published studies often conflict. Exposure of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to high physiological levels (up to 100 nM) of estrogen lead to an up-regulation of annexin A1 expression partially through the activation of CREB, and dependent on activation of the estrogen receptor alpha. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with physiological levels of estrogen (1 nM) induced proliferation while high pregnancy levels of estrogen (100 nM) induced a growth arrest of MCF-7 cells. Silencing of ANXA1 with specific siRNA reverses the estrogen-dependent proliferation as well as growth arrest. ANXA1 is lost in clinical breast cancer, indicating that the anti-proliferative protective function of ANXA1 against high levels of estrogen may be lost in breast cancer. This data suggests that ANXA1 may act as a tumor suppressor gene and modulate the proliferative functions of estrogens. Annexin A1 protects against DNA damage induced by heat in breast cancer cells, adding to the evidence that it has tumor suppressive and protective activities. When ANXA1 is silenced or lost in cancer, cells are more prone to DNA damage, indicating its unidentified diverse role in genome maintenance or integrity. Annexin A1 has also been shown to be associated with treatment resistance. ARID1A loss activates annexin A1 expression, which is required for drug resistance (mTOR inhibitor or trastuzumab) through its activation of AKT.

Annexin 2 is involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell motility (especially that of the epithelial cells), linkage of membrane- associated protein complexes to the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, fibrinolysis, ion channel formation, and cell matrix interactions. It is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein whose function is to help organize exocytosis of intracellular proteins to the extracellular domain. Annexin II is a pleiotropic protein meaning that its function is dependent on place and time in the body.  Gene  The ANXA2 gene, located at 15q22.2, has three pseudogenes located on chromosomes 4, 9 and 10, respectively. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Function  This protein is a member of the annexin family. Members of this calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein family play a role in the regulation of cellular growth and in signal transduction pathways. This protein functions as an autocrine factor which heightens osteoclast formation and bone resorption. Epigenetic regulation of Annexin A2 has been identified as a key determinant of mesenchymal transformation in brain tumors. Annexin A2 has been proposed to function inside the cell in sorting of endosomes and outside the cell in anticoagulant reactions.  Interactions  Annexin A2 has been shown to interact with Prohibitin, CEACAM1, S100A10, PCNA, complement Factor H, and a number of viral factors including the HPV16 minor capsid protein L2.

In flow cytometry, annexin V is commonly used to detect apoptotic cells by its ability to bind to phosphatidylserine, a marker of apoptosis when it is on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. The function of the protein is unknown; however, annexin A5 has been proposed to play a role in the inhibition of blood coagulation by competing for phosphatidylserine binding sites with prothrombin and also to inhibit the activity of phospholipase A1. These properties have been found by in vitro experiments.  Pathology  Antibodies directed against annexin A5 are found in patients with a disease called the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), a thrombophilic disease associated with autoantibodies against phospholipid compounds. Annexin A5 forms a shield around negatively charged phospholipid molecules. The formation of an annexin A5 shield blocks the entry of phospholipids into coagulation (clotting) reactions. In the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, the formation of the shield is disrupted by antibodies. Without the shield, there is an increased quantity of phospholipid molecules on cell membranes, speeding up coagulation reactions and causing the blood-clotting characteristic of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Annexin A5 showed upregulation in papillary thyroid carcinoma.  Laboratory use  Annexin A5 is used as a non-quantitative probe to detect cells that have expressed phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface, an event found in apoptosis as well as other forms of cell death. Platelets also expose PS and PE on their surface when activated, which serves as binding site for various coagulation factors. The annexin A5 affinity assay typically uses a conjugate of annexin V and a fluorescent or enzymatic label, biotin or other tags, or a radioelement, in a suitable buffer (annexin V binding to aminophospholipids is Ca2+ dependent). The assay combines annexin V staining of PS and PE membrane events with the staining of DNA in the cell nucleus with propidium iodide (PI) or 7-Aminoactinomycin D (AAD-7), distinguishing viable cells from apoptotic cells and necrotic cells.Annexin-FP488 fluorescent staining protocol at Interchim Detection occurs by flow cytometry or a fluorescence microscope.

He rose to power under King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and after the king's death sided with Vladislav Jagiellon of Bohemia and later together with P√°l Kinizsi defeated Prince John Corvin in the Battle of Csonthegy (1493). As a result of his cruelty in Transylvania, especially against the Sz√©kelys, he was deposed by the King in 1493 and died shortly afterwards. Family history Matthias Corvinus as depicted in Chronica Hungarorum by Johannes de Thurocz The B√°thory family was a powerful and influential Hungarian noble family from the 14th to 17th century. The two branches of the family produced many voivodes, Transylvanian princes and a king, (Stefan Batory of Poland). B√°thory belonged to the powerful family of Gutkeled, of the Ecsed branch.

Career Stephen B√°thory on the Matthias Corvinus Monument In 1467, he took part in Matthias' bitter defeat against Moldavia at the Battle of Baia. In 1476, Corvinus decided to support Vlad III Dracula in reclaiming his Wallachian throne from Basarab LaiotƒÉ.Dracula: Prince of many faces - His life and his times p. 170 He therefore made B√°thory supreme commander over an army of 8,000 infantry and 13,000 cavalry, but since B√°thory was rather inexperienced in military leadership, \\"the actual leadership was shared by Dracula and the Serbian despot Vuk Brancovic. Before this, Dracula and B√°thory had waged war in Bosnia, where B√°thory was sent by Corvinus to free a certain Bosnian king whose name was also Matthias.Mehmed the Conqueror and his time p. 245 The new campaign would involve Hungarian, Moldavian, and Wallachian troops, with the assistance of a small Serbian contingent. Dracula wrote to his cousin, Prince Stephen III of Moldavia, to wait for him so that the two could merge their armies, but the merging failed due to delayment in movement of the Hungarian troops, which resulted in Stephen's defeat at the Battle of Valea AlbƒÉ on July 26, 1476.Dracula: Prince of many faces - His life and his times p. 171 On August 18, the two armies merged and helped Stephen get rid of the Turks in Moldavia. After a consultation that took place in the city of Bra≈üov, Dracula, B√°thory, and Brancovic invaded Wallachia from southern Transylvania with an army of 35,000, whereas Stephen would aid them by attacking eastern Wallachia with 15,000 men.Dracula: Prince of many faces - His life and his times p. 172 Dracula's offensive began in early November 1476 and defeated LaiotƒÉ's 18,000 strong army at RucƒÉr, at the Wallachian- Transylvanian border. Both armies lost around 10,000 men. On November 8, Dracula captured the capital of T√¢rgovi≈üte where he met with Stephen. The two swore eternal allegiance to one another and when at the presence of B√°thory, the two pledged as well to pursue a great crusade against the Turks. By November 11, B√°thory reported to the town officials of Sibiu that most of Wallachia was in Dracula's hands and added that \\"all the boyars aside from two are with us\\" and \\"even the latter will soon join us.\\" On November 16, Bucharest fell to B√°thory's army and on November 26, Dracula was reestablished as Prince of Wallachia for his third time. After Stephen and B√°thory retreated from Wallachia, LaiotƒÉ would return to Wallachia with an army to reclaim his throne. In December, Laiota and Dracula met each other in battle. Dracula possessed only a small army and was killed in battle. Battle of Bread Field In 1479, B√°thory was made governor of Transylvania and in late August 1479, an Ottoman expedition from Bosnia, commanded by twelve pashas, invaded Transylvania with a force of 43,000 men.Mehmed the Conqueror and his time p. 374 The Turks moved very quickly through the land while pillaging it, giving B√°thory little time to gather his militia at Sibiu. P√°l Kinizsi, the Ban of Timi»ôoara, promised to aid B√°thory. As B√°thory approached Sebe≈ü, Ali Bey, one of the Turkish pashas, had raised camp on a plain between Mure≈ü and Sebe≈ü, unaware that Kinizsi was also on his way against him. On the early morning of October 13, B√°thory appeared on the \\"heights beyond the brook.\\" Ali was forced to stand ground in order to secure an eventual withdrawal and evacuate his booty.\\"Mehmed the Conqueror and his time p. 374-75 B√°thory ordered his army to prepare for battle: his 3,000 Transylvanian Saxons, supported by a second line of Transylvanian Wallachians, comprised the right flank on the Mure≈ü River, while the Hungarians comprised the left flank; he and his heavy cavalry were placed in the middle.Mehmed the Conqueror and his time p. 375 The Ottoman leaders were in disagreement and had their preparations for the battle delayed; after \\"three hours of idle waiting, B√°thory, confident that P√°l Kinizsi would arrive any minute, gave the order to attack.\\" The Transylvanian Saxons opened the attack, but were routed; the Transylvanian Wallachians experienced the same fate, with many being wounded or killed; later, the Hungarian line would be pressured to retreat to the centre. B√°thory then charged with his heavy cavalry, but fell off his horse; this alarmed his companions, who interpreted it as a bad omen and advised him to either turn back or retreat to the mountains. He ignored their advice and, as head of his cavalry, charged the first Ottoman line with great force, routing them. Ali then charged with his cavalry and a fierce battle took place that lasted for three hours. B√°thory was seriously injured, bleeding from six wounds; \\"his horse had been killed under him.\\" Surrounded by a \\"wall of corpses\\" and barely holding onto his life, he was about to lose the battle when Kinizsi's army appeared on the hill, announcing their presence with drums and trumpets. Some 900 Serbs under a Demeter Jak≈°iƒá, assisted by \\"numerous courtiers of the king\\", charged against the Turks.

The Hungarian army was led by P√°l Kinizsi, Istv√°n B√°thory, Vuk Brankoviƒá, and Basarab LaiotƒÉ cel BƒÉtr√¢n. The result of the battle was an important victory for the Kingdom of Hungary and the Serbian Despotate. Background From his ascendence to the Hungarian throne in 1458, King Matthias fought with the Turks, and in 1463, he occupied the northern parts of Bosnia. However, this was not a full-scale war. Turkish marauders attacked Transylvania and Vojvodina several times between 1474 and 1475. The attacks led to the depopulation of some areas with a number of villages abandoned by their inhabitants. After the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War (1463‚Äì79) in the spring of 1479, a major Ottoman army convened under Szendr≈ë (today Smederevo, Serbia), above all, Akƒ±ncƒ±s. When King Matthias was alerted, in the Edict of Gragnica (July.11.), he ordered Stephen V B√°thory, the Voivode of Transylvania and his general P√°l Kinizsi to mobilize. The Ottoman army entered Transylvania on October 9, near Kelnek (C√¢lnic), led by Ali Koca Bey. The Akƒ±ncƒ±s attacked a few villages, homesteads, and market towns, taking a number of Hungarians, Vlachs, and Saxons captive. On October 13, Koca Bey set up his camp in the Breadfield (Keny√©rmez≈ë), near Zsib√≥t. Koca Bey was obliged into the campaign by the insistence of Basarab cel T√¢nƒÉr, a Wallachian prince, who himself brought 1,000‚Äì2,000 infantry to the cause. The Turks continued pillaging and taking prisoners, while B√°thory and Kinizsi made preparations to set forth against the Turks. The Hungarian and the Ottoman armies The numerical strength of the Ottoman army is under debate; one estimate judged them to be 60,000, while Hungarian sources placed them closer to 30,000. Jan D≈Çugosz, the famous Polish chronicler, estimated the Ottoman forces to have been 100,000 men-at-arms, but Matthias Corvinus estimated in his letters that there were 43-45,000 Ottoman and Wallachian soldiers. A more probable number for Ottoman forces was between 6-20 thousand soldiers, and 1,000-2,000 Wallachians. The Ottoman army was almost entirely made up of Akƒ±ncƒ±s, Rumelian Spakhs, and Azaps, with some Janissaries and possibly some cannon. The Ottoman enterprise was not a full-fledged war effort, but rather a very substantial raiding one - the largest expedition Transylvania encountered during a century's worth of Hungarian-Turkish conflicts. Kinizsi's army consisted of Hungarian, Szekler, Serbian, Transylvanian Saxon forces, and some Vlach volunteers. The latter were commanded by Basarab LaiotƒÉ \\"cel BƒÉtr√¢n\\", lit. \\"the Elder\\", quondam ruler of Wallachia and archrival to Basarab \\"cel T√¢nƒÉr\\", lit. \\"the Younger\\". Accordingly, the younger Basarab insisted on equality with the older, with only one being tenable to the Wallachian throne. The combined Christian forces totalled approximated 12,000 to 15,000 men. In the judgement of some, Poles, Moldavians, Russians, Lithuanians, Germans, and Bohemians were privy in part to the battle, but this is rather difficult to substantiate. The battle On October 9 the Turkish army entered Hungary and began raiding. B√°thory waited until the Turks got exhausted in marching and raiding, and once the Ottomans had collected too much loot to move fast enough, he attacked them on October 13. Both armies were composed of three columns. The right flank of the Hungarian army was led by Kinizsi, the left was the Serbian light cavalry under Vuk Grgureviƒá and Demetrius Jak≈°iƒá with the Saxons and B√°thory's forces in the center. On the Ottoman side, Koca Bey took the left flank, Isa Bey the center, and Malkoch Oglu the right flank. The Breadfield in 1870. The battle commenced in the afternoon. B√°thory fell from his horse and the Ottomans nearly captured him, but a nobleman called Antal Nagy whisked the voivode away. Having joined battle, the Ottomans were in ascendancy early on, but Kinizsi charged against the Turks with the Hungarian heavy cavalry and 900 Serbs under Jak≈°iƒá assisted by \\"numerous courtiers of the king\\". Ali Bey was forced to retreat. Kinizsi moved laterally to vigorously smash the Turkish center and before long Isa Bey also withdrew. The few Turks who survived the massacre fled into the mountains, where the majority were killed by the local men. The hero of the battle was P√°l Kinizsi, the legendary Hungarian general and a man of Herculean strength in the service of Matthias Corvinus' Black Army of Hungary. Aftermath Ottoman casualties were extremely high with several thousand men killed, among them Malko√ßoƒülu and Isa bey along with two beys and a thousand of their Wallachian allies. Hungarian forces lost approximately 3,000 men in the battle. A few prisoners were liberated and their ransom was immense. In 1480 Kinizsi raided Serbia and several times defeated Ali Koca Bey. The Breadfield battle was a great psychological victory for the Hungarians, and as a result the Ottoman Turks did not attack southern Hungary and Transylvania for many years thereafter.

The film stars Nelson, Alan Jay Factor, and Joanna Lee and includes a brief appearance by Leonard Nimoy (name misspelled in film credits as \\"Leonard Nemoy\\"). The Brain Eaters was distributed by American International Pictures in different film markets as a double feature with either Earth vs. the Spider or Terror from the Year 5000. Plot In Riverdale, Illinois, a man (Hampton Fancher, uncredited) carrying a lighted, basketball-sized glass container bumps into a pedestrian. The container is broken, a fight ensues, and a hissing sound is heard. Glenn Cameron (Factor) and his fianc√©e, Elaine Cameron (Jody Fair), are out driving when they are distracted by a bright light. They stop to investigate in nearby woods and find three dead animals, coming upon a large, cone-shaped, spiral metal structure resembling a rocket nose cone. Two days later in Washington, D.C., a flying saucer investigation committee reviews classified army footage of the object. Sen. Walter K. Powers (Cornelius Keefe) and his assistant Dan Walker (Robert Ball) arrive late. The metal object stands 50 feet high and has a base diameter of 50 feet. The nature and origin of the object is unknown. Dr. Paul Kettering (Ed Nelson) is the chief investigator. Also noted is the murder of several people in the nearby town. The senator and his assistant fly to Riverdale to investigate and are met by Glenn Cameron, who explains that his father, the mayor, is missing. The three drive to the object's location. Alice Summers (Lee), the mayor's secretary, assists Kettering by recording test results. The senator climbs scaffolding erected around the spiral cone to question Kettering and his assistant, Dr. Wyler (David Hughes). Kettering explains that it appears to be indestructible, then crawls inside to explore. Wyler prepares to go inside just as Kettering crawls out; the interior is made up of a maze of small, winding tunnels. A field phone call informs them that the mayor has returned to his office. Mayor Cameron (Orville Sherman) acts as if possessed. Taking a pistol from his desk drawer, he struggles to point it at his head. Kettering, the senator, Alice and Glenn arrive at town hall. The mayor is hostile and angry, even towards his son. Kettering notices an odd mound near the mayor's neck, under his suit coat. The mayor pulls the pistol on the group. Kettering asks him about the mound, and the mayor strikes his son while attempting to flee the room. As he does, Kettering hits the mayor, who discharges several gunshots. The mayor is shot and killed in the hallway by a deputy. An autopsy reveals something strange. The doctor (Doug Banks) and Kettering find a dead creature of unknown origin attached to the mayor's neck; it injected some kind of toxin into his nervous system. Even without being shot to death, he would have died within 24‚Äì48 hours. As the sheriff (Greigh Phillips) drives toward the metal object, he encounters a man lying on the road, and is attacked by the man as he gets out of his patrol car. Nearby, another man, holding a lighted glass container, watches the fight. The sheriff is knocked out, and the two men remove something from the container. The sheriff revives, and the three drive off in the patrol car. While working with Alice in the lab, Kettering experiments with a piece of the creature taken from the mayor's body. It attaches itself to his arm just like a parasite, but he is able to free himself by burning it with a Bunsen burner. Wyler calls Kettering at the lab, and they drive out to the metal cone. Along the way, they discover an abandoned electric company utility truck. A call to the sheriff from Sen. Powers goes unanswered, as the sheriff struggles with being possessed. Three groups are organized to search for other strange metal objects. Kettering and Alice find the dead body of the utility truck's driver with two puncture wounds on the back of his neck. While searching, Glenn and Elaine are locked inside an empty cabin. Someone tries to set the cabin on fire, but Glenn shoots at the arsonist, and he and his fianc√©e are able to escape. The three groups later reassemble at the mayor's office. There, they discover two glowing containers containing more parasites. The senator calls the telegraph office to send a warning to the governor. The telegrapher (Henry Randolph) takes down the message, but being possessed, does not send it. Three men drive to Alice's apartment building and plant a parasite in her room. She is possessed and joins the three men in their car. Paul and Glenn later discover she is missing. They drive back to the spiral cone and discover a dying man they recognize as Prof. Helsingman (Saul Bronson), who vanished five years earlier along with a scientific expedition team. They discover marks on his neck and take him to a hospital. Kettering questions the professor, but he only utters the word \\"Carboniferous\\", referring to a geologic time period millions of years ago. Sen. Powers tries to make several telephone calls, but is consistently told that the lines are busy. Glenn and Paul go to the telegraph office to find out if the warning was sent to the governor's office. They are attacked but manage to subdue their assailants and flee. Kettering climbs the metal object's scaffolding to check on his equipment. He realizes the two deputies on guard are now possessed, and both are shot and killed. Kettering and Glenn crawl inside the spiral metal cone and discover, behind a sliding tunnel wall, a room filled with a heavy mist. They are greeted by another member of the missing expedition, an old, bearded man (Nimoy). He tells Kettering he was once Prof. Cole and explains, \\"Now I hold a position of a much higher order\\". He provides details about the parasites' invasion, which is coming from inside the Earth, and says, \\"We shall force upon Man a life free from strife and turmoil. Ironic that Man should obtain his long sought utopia as a gift, rather than as something earned\\". After the possessed Cole disappears, Kettering shoots and kills the lurking sheriff. Parasites on the loose chase Kettering and Glenn outside. Kettering formulates a plan using the abandoned power company truck. He connects an electrical wire from one end of the ravine to the other using a harpoon gun. He prepares to shoot a connecting wire from the metal object to an overhead high voltage transmission line, completing a circuit. Before Kettering can finish, Alice exits the spiral cone and appears on the scaffolding. Kettering climbs up to rescue her, but being possessed, she refuses to come with him. She pulls a pistol and shoots him, and he falls to his death. Glenn fires the harpoon gun, making the connection to the overhead transmission lines, which engulfs the grounded metal cone in high-voltage sparks. Alice collapses as the parasites inside the object are electrocuted. Sen. Powers and Glenn crawl inside and verify that the menace has been eliminated. Later, as Glenn and Elaine walk away from the site, they embrace.

Heinlein sued for plagiarism, asking for damages of $150,000, claiming that The Brain Eaters was based on his 1951 novel The Puppet Masters. Corman insisted that he was unfamiliar with Heinlein's work, both while reading the script and during the film's production. He did, however, see the obvious comparisons once he read the novel, so he settled out of court for $5,000 and agreed to Heinlein's demand that he receive no screen credit, as he found the film \\"wanting\\".

History The original Marysville High School was constructed in the 1920s and taught grades 6 to 12. It was located at the corner of Huron Blvd. and Michigan Ave. in what was downtown Marysville. In the 1940s, the relatively small school could not accommodate the growing population of the city, caused in part by the opening of the Wills Sainte Claire automobile factory. A new school was necessary, but since this was during World War II, the school board had to petition the U.S. War Department to build the new school. Pictures of the entire student body crammed into a hallway of the old school were sent with the petition. In 1942, permission was granted to construct a new school.https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thetimesherald/access/1955637471.html?FMT=ABS&date;=Jan+24,+2010 Times Herald Archive The new Marysville High was built adjacent to the original building, which was later known as \\"the annex\\". During construction, the basement of the school was reinforced with steel and concrete support beams so it could double as an air raid shelter. The completed school included a gymnasium and auditorium. In later years, the Detroit Pistons held summer practices in Marysville High's gym. In the 1950s and 1960s, a swimming pool, commercial arts, and home economics wing were added. Over the years, Marysville High School underwent more upgrades and renovations, including an addition to the south side of the school in 1979. The property was the former home of the 575-square-foot \\"annex\\", which served as the public library until it burned down in 1975.http://www.sccl.lib.mi.us/BranchInfo.aspx?id=8 Marysville Library The addition contained 14 classrooms, a band room, and a choir room. In 2007, a bond proposal to demolish the existing school and build a new one passed by a slight majority, and work began to build the next Marysville High School. The New Marysville High, located on Huron Blvd. a block east of the existing school, opened for the 2010-11 school year.http://www.thetimesherald.com/print/article/20100316/NEWS01/3160308/School- s-progress-amazing School's Progress 'Amazing' The football team plays at Walt Braun Viking Stadium at the corner of Michigan and Collard.

History Established in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, in 1848 by Congregational and Presbyterian American missionaries, the NEC is the oldest and the largest of nine congregations situated outside Beirut in the towns of Abeih, Aramoun, Khaldeh, Kafarshima, Hadath, Dbayyeh, Jdeideh and Dhour el- Shweir. The National Evangelical Church of Beirut is the headquarters and administrative centre of these nine churches which operate under the name of the National Evangelical Union of Lebanon (NEUL). In 1870, the first Evangelical Church was built to house the Arabic and English speaking congregations. During the next hundred years, the church was the centre for all the activities and celebrations of both communities. Then during the Lebanese civil war (1975‚Äì1990) it was totally destroyed except for the bell tower and its congregation consequently scattered. Since its reconstruction in 1998, the National Evangelical Church of Beirut has been standing again in the heart of Beirut's Central District, re-gathering its people with its worship services presided by Rev.

Its former anchors were Lord & Taylor, Bloomingdale's, Dave & Buster's, AMC Theatres and Borders Books and Music, the last three which acted as junior anchors for the mall. Lord & Taylor, the mall's final anchor, operated until 2020, five years after the mall's initial closure and demolition. The store's closure left the entire property void of any businesses. History =Early years= The mall opened in 1977 and was initially anchored by Lord & Taylor, I. Magnin (the sole East Coast branch of the chain, which closed in June 1992), and the second Bloomingdale's location in the Washington, D.C., area (after Tysons Corner Center). Borders Books and Music took over the I. Magnin location in 1993; it closed in 2011. I. Magnin was only on levels 2 & 3 while Lord & Taylor was on levels 1 & 2\\\\. Raleigh Haberdasher also had a suburban branch at the center. Some shopping areas revolved around a motif; Georgetown on the third floor and Via Rialto on the ground floor, which were recreations of the urban districts in Washington and Venice. The latter was a block of shops and restaurants stretching from the center court to the main entrance facing Rockvile Pike where Bertucci's and Cheesecake Factory later stood. Both Georgetown and Restaurant Row, home to Intermission Nightclub and Dining Disco in the late 1970s, the first shopping mall disco in the country, were replaced by Dave & Buster's in 1996. Other restaurants and fast food vendors populated the mall including the food court The Eatery, which went from a darker earth tone color motif to bright neon in the 1980s as well as the third-floor loft overlooking the center court. =Later years= The mall found creative ways to promote itself over the years. White Flint was the first mall to issue its own credit card to frequent shoppers. To celebrate its 25th anniversary, the mall released its own Monopoly game entitled \\"White Flint-opoly\\". Three decorative water features were located on the first level of the center. The largest was a fountain underneath and around the mirrored escalators, loosely based on the Rialto Bridge and Grand Canal in Venice, in the Via Rialto mall within a mall. This fountain was low to the ground which made it prone to children falling in causing it to be removed when I. Magnin closed. Two identical fountains were in center court, one in front of each glass elevator, and removed during a 2004 mall facelift. One oddity about the closure of Borders on April 17, 2011, was the sign that remained in front of the escalator leading to its permanently shuttered entrance that read \\"Temporarily Out of Service\\". Over the years major celebrities have appeared at the mall like Donna Karan and Elizabeth Taylor, as well as minor and local stars like the cast of MTV's The Real World: D.C., Brigitte Burdine, Andrea Mitchell, Paula Marshall, Giuliana Rancic and Christine Blasey Ford. The mall's impact was felt throughout the metro area in places such as Prince George's County which lacked any regional shopping centers as upscale as White Flint. This led to some spots like Landover Mall and Iverson Mall receiving the nickname \\"Black Flint Mall\\", while alternately White Flint was dubbed the \\"White Iverson Mall\\". White Flint was a popular destination on Halloween, known for its annual \\"Howl-O-Ween\\" event with special trick-or-treating and hosting children's magic shows performed by area entertainers including The Great Zucchini and Dean Carnegie among others. The mall was served by the White Flint station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro since 1984. =Demolition and redevelopment= Shuttered storefronts at White Flint Mall in 2014 The back of White Flint (where the parking garage and Dave and Buster's once stood) completely opened up during demolition on October 24, 2015. alt= In November 2011, Lerner Enterprises announced plans to deconstruct the mall and its large parking deck and replace it with four office buildings, a 300-room hotel, of retail and restaurant space, and 12 apartment buildings consisting of a total of 2,500 residences. The developers expected construction to begin two years following approval and take approximately 25 years to be fully completed. On January 5, 2012, Macy's Inc. announced that the mall's Bloomingdale's store would close in March 2012. Bloomingdale's closed on March 14, 2012, and the building it occupied was demolished in 2013 prior to the mall's closure. Lerner Enterprises revived its plans for redevelopment in late 2013. By year's end, the mall had lost more than three-fourths of its stores. On December 24, 2013, WJLA-TV reported that White Flint Mall would be permanently closed after nearly 37 years. On August 13, 2014, Dave & Buster's was evicted. P. F. Chang's China Bistro closed January 4, 2015, along with the mall entrance, thus shuttering the mall for good, with the exception of Lord & Taylor, its only remaining anchor store. Lord & Taylor is remaining through the redevelopment process, however, they have been involved in litigation with the mall beginning in July 2013, and went to trial to seek damages on July 28, 2015. On August 14, 2015, the court ruled that White Flint owed Lord & Taylor $31,000,000. White Flint appealed the court's decision; the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the previous verdict in favor of Lord & Taylor, stating that the mall's owners' breached their 1975 contract with Lord & Taylor to maintain the property as a \\"first-class\\" mall until 2042. The appeals court ruled that mall's owners \\"could not establish to a 'reasonable certainty' whether and to what extent Lord & Taylor would benefit from the redevelopment\\". The opinion also noted the mall's owners failed to provide the jury with a clear picture of when the new town center would be built, how many buildings it would include and what types of businesses would be expected to lease space in it. The appeals court ruled that the $31,000,000 was a reasonable estimation of lost profits and future construction costs to reconfigure the store. However, this never came to pass as Lord & Taylor will close in late 2020. Contractors began the exterior demolition of the mall, beginning with the southeastern parking garage nearest to the former Bloomingdale's store site, on July 7, 2015. Demolition of the actual mall building and the remaining parking garages, except the one connected to Lord & Taylor, was finished in January 2016. The mall's original site was one of multiple locations in the Washington metropolitan area competing to be Amazon's second headquarters. Ultimately, the second headquarters was awarded to Crystal City, Virginia, allowing Lerner to continue its original redevelopment plans. On August 2, 2020, it was announced that White Flint's last remaining anchor store, Lord & Taylor, would close. Later in the same month, it was announced that all 38 stores would close.

Eastern Orthodox bishop holding a paschal trikirion with two deacons (backs to camera) holding paschal deacon's candles. The paschal trikirion is held by the serving priest (whether a bishop or a presbyter) in contrast to the bishop's trikirion which the bishop uses for blessing and is held or carried alongside the bishop. It is used from the commencement of the celebration of the Resurrection during the Paschal Vigil through the end of Bright Week, and also on the Apodosis of Pascha, \\"Archbishop Averky Liturgics -- The Leave-taking of Pascha\\", Retrieved 2011-12-24 when it is used at sundry times, in particular, while chanting the paschal verses at the beginning of Vespers, Matins and the Divine Liturgy, while censing, during the Little Entrance, and when giving the paschal greeting. Styles The paschal trikirion is fashioned in various styles in various regions. The Greek form of the paschal trikirion generally has a flat base allowing it to stand upright, and above this base is a vertical shaft terminating in three candleholders; sometimes this base has an icon of the Resurrection. The candleholders may be mounted at an angle so that the candles cross each other, as in a bishop's trikirion. Often the candles are tied together with ribbons at the point of intersection. Sometimes, among the Greeks, the priest simply holds a large single candle. Another form, more commonly seen in the Slavic churches, has the three candleholders attached to a large blessing crucifix with a vertical handle. This form cannot stand upright while the candles are lit. The candles may be white or each candle may be a different color and fresh flowers often decorate the candleholder. The trikirion holds three candles, representing the Resurrection of Christ on the third day, and also representing the three persons of the Holy Trinity, all three of whom, according to Orthodox theology, were actively involved in the salvation of man. Deacon's candle Russian Orthodox deacon holding a red paschal deacon's candle As specified in the liturgical books the Pentecostarion and the Typicon, deacons also carry a candle throughout the paschal services. The deacon's candle is a single large candle which he carries in his left hand while reciting ektenias (litanies), while censing, and at other times when his hands are not otherwise occupied. It is also often decorated with fresh flowers. In the Slavic tradition, this candle may be red.

Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating stereophonic sound (using telephone technology) was demonstrated by Cl√©ment Ader in Paris in 1881. The pallophotophone, invented by Charles A. Hoxie and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35 mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip. The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later mixdown or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track monophonic tape recording, the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British EMI engineer Alan Blumlein patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and surround sound on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of stereo tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks. The next major development in multitrack recording came in the mid-1950s, when the Ampex corporation devised the concept of 8-track recording, using its \\"Sel-Sync\\" (Selective Synchronous) recording system, and sold the first such machine to musician Les PaulARSC Journal, Sel-sync and the \\"Octopus\\": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs. However, for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive ‚Äì the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 ‚Äì roughly three times the US average yearly income in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 with the introduction of the TASCAM Portastudio, which used the inexpensive compact audio cassette as the recording medium, making good- quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. However, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as Pro Tools and Cubase were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like GarageBand were being included as a standard feature on home computers. AMPEX 440 (two track, four track) and 16-track MM1000 Overview Stereo sound recording on tape was perfected in 1943 by German audio engineers working for the AEG corporation. Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer John T. Mullin and the Ampex corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape ‚Äì being a linear recording medium ‚Äì could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity (\\"HiFi\\") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz recordings continued to be issued in mono sound until the late 1960s. Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician Les Paul, who lent his name to Gibson's first solid- body electric guitar. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer Mary Ford. But it was Patti Page who was the first vocalist to record her own voice, sound on sound, with a song called 'Confess', in 1947: Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice, due to his well-known use of technology. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to overdub her vocals on a song. This was months before Les Paul and Mary Ford had their first multi- voiced release. Paul was the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously ‚Äì that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them. In 1963, solo jazz pianist, Bill Evans, recorded Conversations with Myself, an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself, in effect creating a two-piano duet of jazz improvisations. Despite Ampex having created the first 8-track tape machines for Les Paul and Atlantic Records, multitrack recording was taken up in a more limited way in the industry via 3-track recorders. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings ‚Äì including many of Phil Spector's so-called \\"Wall of Sound\\" productions and early Motown hits ‚Äì were taped on 3-track recorders. The next evolution was 4-track recording, which was the studio standard through the mid 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by The Beatles and The Rolling Stones were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's Abbey Road Studios became particularly adept at the technique called \\"reduction mixes\\" in the UK and \\"bouncing down\\" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity. By the mid-1960s, the ready availability of the most up-to-date multitrack recorders ‚Äì which were by then standard equipment in the leading Los Angeles recording studios ‚Äì enabled Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys to become one of the first pop producers to exploit the huge potential of multitrack recording. During the group's most innovative period of music-making, from 1964 to 1967, Wilson developed elaborate techniques for assembling the band's songs, which combined elements captured on both 4-track and 8-track recorders, as well as making extensive use of tape editing. By 1964, Wilson's increasingly complex arrangements had far outstripped the group's limited musical abilities ‚Äì singer-guitarist Carl Wilson was the only group member who regularly contributed to these tracking sessions ‚Äì so Wilson began routinely recording all the instrumental backing tracks for his songs using the team of top-rank professional studio musicians who came to be known as \\"The Wrecking Crew\\". For the group's landmark Pet Sounds album in 1966, Wilson recorded all the album's elaborate backing tracks using The Wrecking Crew and other session musicians, while the Beach Boys were away touring; the session musicians typically performed these instrumental tracks as ensemble performances, which were recorded and mixed live, direct to a 4-track recorder. When the other Beach Boys returned from touring, they moved to Columbia's Hollywood studio, which was equipped with the latest 8-track technology; by this time, Wilson and his engineers had 'reduced' the pre-recorded 4-track backing tracks to a mono mix, which was then dubbed onto one track of the 8-track master tape; Wilson then recorded the vocal tracks, assigning one individual track to each of the six vocalists (including soon-to-be permanent member Bruce Johnston), leaving the eighth track available for final 'sweetening' elements, such as additional vocal or instrumental touches, and lastly, all these elements were mixed down to the mono master tape. Nearly all of the Beach Boys' 4-track and 8-track masters from this period are preserved in Capitol's archive, allowing the label to release several expansive boxed sets of this music; The Pet Sounds Sessions (1997), includes nearly all the separate backing and vocal tracks from the album, as well as new stereo mixes of all the songs, while the 9-CD The Smile Sessions (2011) features a wide cross-section of the huge amount of instrumental and vocal material (totalling around 50 hours of recordings) that was recorded for the group's never-completed 1967 magnum opus, Smile. All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums Revolver and Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing- down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum. 4-track tape also led to a related development, quadraphonic sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon and Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now sometimes considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the surround sound technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems. In a professional audio setting today, such as a recording studio, audio engineers may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, using one or more tracks for each instrument played. The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of magnetic tape as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33‚Öì rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on magnetic tape, then transferred to disc, with Bing Crosby leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.  Ampex's original eight-track recorder  The original Ampex eight-track recorder (not to be confused with eight-track tape endless-loop cartridge players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project. It was based on an Ampex 1\\" data recorder transport with modified Ampex model 350 electronics. It stood over tall and weighed . Eight tracks were chosen because that was the number of recording tracks with guard tracks that would fit on a recording tape, the widest tape available at the time. The first of the Ampex eight-track recorders was sold to Les Paul for $10,000 in 1957 and was installed in his home recording studio by David Sarser.Studio 3: A Place of Recording Studio History... It became known as the \\"Octopus\\". The second Ampex model 5258 eight-track was sold to Atlantic Records at Tom Dowd's insistence in late 1957. Atlantic was the first record company to use a multi-track (as opposed to stereo or three-track) recorder in their studio.  Multi-channel recorders  Multi-track recording differs from overdubbing and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks. Sound on sound, which Les Paul invented, adds a new performance to an existing recording by placing a second playback head in front of the erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track. Multi-track recorders also differ from early stereo and three-track recorders that were available at the time in that they can record individual tracks while preserving the other tracks. The original multi-channel recorders could only record all tracks at once. The earliest multitrack recorders were analog magnetic tape machines with two or three tracks. Elvis Presley was first recorded on multitrack during 1957, as RCA's engineers were testing their new machines. Buddy Holly's last studio session in 1958 employed three-track recording, resulting in his only stereo releases not to include overdubs. The new three-track system allowed the lead vocal to be recorded on a dedicated track, while the remaining two tracks could be used to record the backing tracks in full stereo.  Other early multi-track recorders  Frank Zappa experimented in the early 1960s with a custom built five-track recorder built by engineer Paul Buff in his Pal Recording Studio in Rancho Cucamonga, California. Buff later went on to work in larger Hollywood studios. However, recorders with four or more tracks were restricted mainly to major American recording studios until the mid-to-late 1960s, mainly because of import restrictions and the high cost of the technology. In England, pioneering independent producer Joe Meek produced all of his innovative early 1960s recordings using monophonic and two-track recorders. Like Meek, EMI house producer George Martin was considered an innovator for his use of two- track as a means to making better mono records, carefully balancing vocals and instruments; Abbey Road Studios installed Telefunken four-track machines in 1959 and 1960 (replaced in 1965 by smaller, more durable Studer machines), but The Beatles would not have access to them until late 1963, and all recordings prior to their first world hit single \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" (1964) were made on two-track machines. Impact on popular music The artistic potential of the multitrack recorder came to the attention of the public in the 1960s, when artists such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys began to multitrack extensively, and from then on virtually all popular music was recorded in this manner. The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two- track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity. The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP Pet Sounds relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. Brian Wilson pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then 'dubbed down' to one track of an eight-track tape. Six of the remaining seven tracks were then used to individually record the vocals of each member of The Beach Boys, and the eighth track was reserved for any final 'sweetening' overdubs of instruments or voices. 3M introduced the 1-inch eight-track version of their model M-23 recorder in 1966, probably the first mass-produced machine of this format. It remained in production until 1970 and was used by many top studios worldwide including Abbey Road Studios in London. Both Pete Townshend and John Lennon had 3M 8-track machines in their home project studios c. 1969‚Äì1970. Ampex began mass production of their competing 1-inch eight-track MM1000 in 1967. One of the first 8-track machines in Los Angeles was built by Scully Recording Instruments of Bridgeport, Connecticut and installed at American Recorders in late 1967. The debut album by Steppenwolf was recorded there and was released in January 1968. Because The Beatles did not gain access to eight-track recorders until 1968, their groundbreaking Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP (1967) was created using pairs of four-track machines; the group also used vari-speed (also called pitch shift) to achieve unique sounds, and they were the first group in the world to use an important offshoot of multitrack recording, the Automatic Double Tracking (ADT) system invented by Abbey Road staff engineer Ken Townsend in 1966. Other artists began experimenting with multitrack's possibilities also, with The Music Machine (of \\"Talk Talk\\" fame) recording on a custom-built ten-track setup, and Pink Floyd collaborating with former Beatles recording engineer Norman \\"Hurricane\\" Smith, who produced their first albums. The first eight-track machine in the UK was built by Scully and installed at London's Advision Studios in early 1968. Among the first eight- track recordings made there were the single Dogs by The Who and the album My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows by the band Tyrannosaurus Rex. Trident Studios obtained their first eight-track recorder soon afterwards. It was during The Beatles' recording of their White Album sessions of late 1968 that Abbey Road Studios finally had eight-track recorders installed, until then the group went to Trident to record with eight-tracks. The Beatles used eight-track to record portions of the White Album, the song \\"Hey Jude\\" and the later Abbey Road. Other western countries also lagged well behind the USA ‚Äì in Australia, the largest local recording label, Festival Records, did not install a four-track recorder until late 1966; the first eight-track recorders did not appear there until the late 1960s. Large format analog recorders In 1967, Ampex built its first prototype 16-track professional audio recorder at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City. This machine used reels of 2-inch tape on a modified tape transport system originally built for video recording. In 1968, it introduced the 16-track production model MM-1000, the first commercially available 16-track machine. Machines of this size are difficult to move and costly to maintain. Prices were very high, typically $10,000 to $30,000 U.S. dollars. One of the first 16-track recorders was installed at CBS Studios in New York City where it was used to record the second album by Blood, Sweat & Tears released in December 1968. The Grateful Dead released their first 16-track recordings Aoxomoxoa in June 1969 and Live/Dead in November 1969. TTG Studios in Los Angeles built its own 16-track machine in 1968. This was used on Frank Zappa's album Hot Rats released in October 1969. Volunteers by Jefferson Airplane was released in November 1969. The back of the Jefferson Airplane album cover includes a picture of the 16-track MM-1000. Advision and Trident were among the first studios in the UK to install 16-track machines. Trident installed its first 16-track machine in late 1969. \\"After The Flood\\", a song from the Van der Graaf Generator album The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other, was recorded at this studio on 16 tracks in December 1969. Production of 16-track machines boomed and the number of studios worldwide using these machines exploded during 1970 and 1971. By the end of 1971, there were at least 21 studios in London using 16-track recorders in conjunction with Dolby Laboratories noise reduction.\\"Spotlight on London\\" Billboard Magazine, 13 November 1971 ‚Äì advertisement, pg. L-26 Artists using Trident at this time also included Genesis and David Bowie as well as Queen who experimented with multitracking extensively most prominently on their albums Queen II and A Night at the Opera. Australia's first 16-track recorder was installed at Armstrong's Studios in Melbourne in 1971; Festival installed Australia's first 24-track recorder at its Sydney studio in 1974. During the 1970s, 16, 24, and 32 tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08 cm ‚Äì 7.62 cm) wide. The so- called \\"golden age\\" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using hard disk drives instead of tape. Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved. Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available. Prototype machines, by MCI in 1978, using 3\\" tape for 32 tracks never went into production, though Otari made a 32 track 2\\" MX-80. A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format. Maintaining these machines has become increasingly difficult as new parts are rarely available. New tape is still available but prices have risen significantly in recent years. Home systems TEAC 2340, a popular early (1973) home multitrack recorder, four tracks on ¬º inch tape. In 1972 TEAC marketed their consumer four-channel quadraphonic tape recorders for use as home multitrack recorders. The result were the popular TEAC 2340 and 3340 models. Both used ¬º inch tape. The 2340 ran at either 3¬æ or 7¬Ω inches per second and used 7-inch reels while the 3340 ran at 7¬Ω or 15 inches per second and used 10¬Ω inch reels. The 2340 was priced at under U.S. $1,000 making it very popular for home use. The advent of the compact audio cassette (developed in 1963) ultimately led to affordable, portable four-track machines such as the Tascam Portastudio which debuted in 1979. Cassette-based machines could not provide the same audio quality as reel-to-reel machines, but served as a useful tool for professional and semi-pro musicians in making song demos. The Portastudio had a revolutionary effect on the emerging punk rock genre, because it enabled young bands to make recordings without signing to a record label. In the early years of punk, many bands self-produced their own recordings and sold them at gigs and by putting advertisements in underground zines. Bruce Springsteen's 1982 album Nebraska was made this way, with Springsteen choosing the album's earlier demo versions over the later studio recordings. The familiar tape cassette was designed to accommodate four channels of audio ‚Äì in a commercially recorded cassette these four tracks would normally constitute the stereo channels (each consisting of two tracks) for both 'sides' of the cassette ‚Äì in a four-track cassette recorder all four tracks of a cassette are used together, often with the tape running at twice the normal speed (3¬æ instead of 1‚Öû inches per second) for increased fidelity. A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not use the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one. When recording is complete, the volume level of each track is optimized, electronic effects such as reverb are added to certain tracks where desired, each track is separately 'panned' to the desired point in the stereo field and the resulting stereo signal is mixed down to a separate stereo machine (such as a conventional cassette recorder). Digital multitracking The Alesis HD24 stand-alone multitrack hard disk recorder. By the early 1970s, Thomas Stockham of Sound Stream Digital, created the first practical use of pulse code modulation, also called PCM digital recording, for high fidelity purposes. The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, Enrico Caruso. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up the scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in \\"real time\\" as the early computers were not very powerful or fast, compared to 2010-era computers. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape and then played back, in real time. The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process. By the late 1970s, 3M introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It used 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing & mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital \\"word\\". The only converters of the day were 12 bit & 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit \\"word\\" for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50 kHz). It was known to be the best sounding of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50 kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1 kHz for CD's & 48 kHz for digital video. The accepted world standard was created by Sony along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and Mitsubishi Corporation created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2-inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the \\"DASH\\" format meaning, \\" Digital Audio Stationary Head\\". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the dynamic range and signal to noise ratios. Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, a company which made digital drum machines and inexpensive analog audio mixers introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was named the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function remote control was also available. The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8 mm video format tapes. Those recorded four duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a \\"read before write\\" function for overdubbing purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 & 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording. It changed the recording industry forever. Korg D888 eight-track digital recorder By the late 1990s, dedicated multitrack recorders faded with the introduction of the Macintosh operating system and Windows operating systems in personal computers. Some of the first companies jumping on board with this technology were New England Digital and Digidesign, from the US, and Fairlight, from Australia. Through the 1990s, multitrack recorders became digital, using a variety of technologies and media types. These including digital tape format (such as ADAT), or in some cases Minidiscs. Some of the leading providers of multitrackers were Tascam (hard drive or cassette based), Alesis (ADAT digital tape based), Roland/Boss (hard drive based), Fostex (hard drive based), Yamaha (hard drive based), and Korg. A highly competitive market and rapidly falling costs for this equipment has made it common to find multitrack recording technology outside a typical recording studio.  Computer-based recording  The first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called Deck, was released in 1990. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was programmed and designed by Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton from a small San Francisco based company.Wired article on Digidesign/OSC history They formed the platform upon which Pro Tools was built in 1991. The same technology lay behind the 1992 release of Cubase Audio, the first version to offer audio support in addition to MIDI sequencing capabilities. While hardware costs have fallen, the power of the personal computer has increased, so that in the 2010s a good quality home computer is sufficiently powerful to serve as a complete multitrack recorder, if a band or performer has a USB microphone or a regular microphone and a sound card adapter, using inexpensive hardware and software. Since 2012, the multitracking software GarageBand is offered as a free download for all of Apple's new computers or $4.99 for older models. GarageBand added to the many free or under $100 solutions available to the Windows platform that run on less expensive but often more powerful hardware. In a price range between $150 and usually under $1000, superior software mimicking complex recording studios that once could cost a hundred thousand dollars, or more, are also available However solutions this powerful are not needed for most applications. This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them. In early (circa) 2000 the availability of low cost CakeWalk for Windows provided opportunities for many to get a start in multi-track digital recording on Windows for around $50 to $100. After hardware became more powerful, more capabilities became available, including more digital channels and plug in effects. In the 2010s, the availability of inexpensive software coupled with low cost hardware solutions, have enabled many singer-songwriters to self-produce their first recordings without paying high fees for a professional recording studio or audio engineer. The most popular DAW today are: FL Studio, Pro Tools, Reaper, Live, Cubase, Logic and Digital Performer.

Reorganized 25 October 1932 in the Virginia National Guard as the 111th Field Artillery and assigned to the 29th Division; Headquarters federally recognized 26 May 1923 at Norfolk. (Location of headquarters changed 28 August 1939 to Hampton.) The regiment was inducted into Federal service 12 March 1942 and its elements reorganized and redesignated as follows: Headquarters disbanded at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland; 1st and 2d Battalions as the 111th and 227th Field Artillery Battalions, elements of the 29th Infantry Division; (remainder of regiment‚Äîhereafter separate lineages). The 111th FA Battalion, part of the 29th Infantry Division, was based in Norfolk, Virginia,Balkowski, p. 25 made up of the Virginia National Guard.Balkowski, p. 41 It took part in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944, but its members were not happy with their mission. The plan was for them to bring their 105mm howitzers ashore two hours after the initial landings, to support the 116th Infantry Regiment, which was intended to have secured the beach by then.Balkowski, p. 140 But the unit's leader, Lt Colonel Mullins, was concerned that the DUKW amphibious vehicles which were their intended transport were not able to bear heavy loads in rough seas. Each DUKW had to carry a howitzer, fourteen men, ammunition, sandbags and other equipment to the beach. Lieutenant Colonel Mullins was killed during the battle. The 111th Field Artillery Battalion inactivated 16 January 1946 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. It was reorganized and Federally recognized 1 November 1946 with headquarters at Norfolk. 227th Field Artillery Battalion inactivated 16 January 1946 at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. Redesignated 2 July 1946 as the 442d Field Artillery Battalion and relieved from assignment to the 29th Infantry Division. Reorganized and Federally recognized 20 December 1946 with headquarters at Richmond. The 111th and 442d Field Artillery Battalions were consolidated 1 June 1959 with Headquarters, 111th Field Artillery (reconstituted 25 August 1945 in the Virginia National Guard), the 615th Missile Battalion (organized and Federally recognized 13 September 1954 with headquarters at South Norfolk), the 710th Missile Battalion, and the 129th Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion (organized and Federally recognized 13 December 1956 with headquarters at Norfolk) to form the 111th Artillery, a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System, to consist of the 1st Howitzer Battalion, an element of the 29th Infantry Division, the 2d Howitzer Battalion, the 3d Automatic Weapons Battalion, and the 4th and 5th Missile Battalions.

Iraq War Operations Bravo Battery was mobilized on 11 October 2004 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom with MAJ Walter N. Patrick as the battery commander and First Sergeant Martin Steiner as the unit's first sergeant. The unit was reconfigured as a 182-man military police company, received other members of the 2d Battalion, 111th Field Artillery, and moved to Fort Dix for post mobilization training on 14 October 2004. Bravo Battery completed training 30 days ahead of schedule and arrived in Kuwait at Camp Virginia on 30 December 2004 and moved on to Camp Bucca in Iraq on 7 January 2005. Bravo sent two platoons, led by 1LT Michael Belforti, to Abu Ghraib. Two platoons and the battery headquarters remained at Camp Bucca. While at Camp Bucca, Bravo Battery operated Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4. The unit was also tasked with detainee transfers between Camp Bucca and northern bases. The platoons at Abu Ghraib also performed detainee operations and participated in the Battle of Abu Ghraib. Bravo Battery was relieved in place and a battle hand off was completed on 1 December 2005 with the 116th FA, Florida National Guard, and the unit and its men redeployed to Camp Victory South in Kuwait. While in Iraq, Bravo Battery completed all detainee transfers without loss of life to any detainee or coalition forces. The unit was awarded the Air Force Meritorious Unit Award and has been recommended for the Army's Meritorious Unit Commendation. Fourteen members of Bravo Battery received the Bronze Star in Iraq and the unit completed over 80 theater wide detainee movements without incident. While in Iraq, the unit initially reported to LTC Tim Houser of the 105th MP Battalion and COL James Brown of the 18th Military Police Brigade. Later they reported to the 785th MP Battalion and the 43d Military Police Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Kevin R. McBride. The unit was reflagged as an infantry unit upon coming home from Iraq. In April 2009 the regiment's 1st Battalion received 16 new M119 howitzers.Hansen, Louis, (Virginian Pilot) \\"Howitzer Unit Gets Big Bang Back: New guns put Guard group in business after two-year break\\", Washington Times, 2 May 2009, p. 7.

He was born in Dossenheim-sur-Zinsel, but spent his youth in Offwiller, a village at the foot of the Vosges mountain range in Alsace. He was the father of botanist Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper (1856-1901), and a cousin to naturalist Karl Friedrich Schimper (1803-1867) and botanist Georg Heinrich Wilhelm Schimper (1804-1878). Life Following graduation from the University of Strasbourg, he worked as a curator at the Natural History Museum in Strasbourg, becoming director of the museum in 1839. The museum has a bust of Schimper at the top of the stairs. From 1862 until 1879, he was a professor of geology and natural history at the University of Strasbourg. Schimper's contributions to biology were primarily in the specialized fields of bryology (study of mosses) and paleobotany (study of plant fossils). He spent considerable time collecting botanical specimens in his travels throughout Europe. Among his writings was the six-volume Bryologia Europaea, an epic work that was published between 1836 and 1855. It was co-written with Philipp Bruch (1781-1847), and it described every species of European moss known at the time. Schimper also made significant contributions in geology. In 1874 he proposed a new scientific subdivision of geological time.

The only mustering which could not fit neatly into either (due to the multi disciplinary nature of their work) the gunnies were given the choice of going to either mustering. Of the 400 or so in the whole of the RAAF only a handful elected to become Aircraft Technicians. The bulk of them were rolled into the Avionics Technician category. This was, at the time, considered a controversial decision given the highly specialised skills required to be an armourer. In the late 2000s the RAAF re-established the Armament mustering with the first class graduating from RAAF Base Wagga in 2008/09.

They are co-authors of three commercially published books and produced over 100 limited edition books. Early lives Peter R. Thomas was born January 5, 1954 in Los Angeles, California, United States. He studied the book arts with William Everson at Lime Kiln Press and graduated from University of California, Santa Cruz with a BA degree in Aesthetic Studies in 1978. Donna (Millar) Thomas was born March 31, 1957 in San Francisco, California. She graduated from the School of Expressive Arts at Sonoma State University in 1979. Career From 1974-1989 Peter and Donna Thomas made and sold books and paper at the Living History Center's Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California. In 1977 Peter and Donna Thomas established a private press in 1976 and have worked individually and collaboratively on creating books, making paper, letterpress printing and book binding.Fine Press Books - Peter Thomas and Donna Thomas - Fine Books and Collections Their books have been shown in the United States and abroad and purchased for collections. In 1977 Peter and Donna Thomas founded the Good Book Press and in 1978 they printed their first book. It was their aim to create books in the tradition of the great private presses: limited editions, made of the finest materials and produced to the highest standards of quality. They spent the next ten years producing \\"fine press\\" books in both full size and miniature format, making the paper, printing, and binding the books themselves. In the late 1980s Peter and Donna began working in new formats made possible by access to personal computer technology, exploring non-traditional book structures and shaped book objects, as both limited editions and one-of-a-kind books. In 1988 they reorganized under the imprint Peter and Donna Thomas: Santa Cruz. In 1992 they printed Good Books, a bibliography of their work, listing over fifty titles representing many authors and a wide range of subjects. They lectured and taught workshops internationally and published articles on papermaking and other aspects of the book arts. Beginning in the 1990s, they focused their energy on documenting the history and techniques of hand papermaking as a contribution to the renaissance of the craft‚Äîthrough lectures, video productions about the ergonomics and techniques of traditional vat mill hand papermakers in Europe and a traveling exhibition based around A Collection of Paper Samples Handmade in the USA (1993).Contents This book features individual papermakers‚Äô statements about the papers they make, each printed letterpress on a sample of that person's paper. Paper from Plants followed in 1999. They co-authored More Making Books by Hand (2004), The Muir Ramble Route (2010), and 1000 Artists' Books (2012). In 2005 the Thomases published The History of Papermaking in the Philippines. It began with Peter attending a one-day papermaking workshop in Santa Cruz, California taught by Nida Dumsang from the Philippines. Upon learning that there was no written history of papermaking in the Philippines, the idea of writing the first history of Filipino papermaking was born. He first visited the Philippines in February 1990 and gathered information over the following ten years. The book includes discussions of the pre-historic precursors to paper, including Philippine bark cloth. It contains a survey of the first printed books made in the Philippines and the paper they were printed on. It ends with a chronological history of both commercial and hand paper making in the Philippines up to 2000. In 2012 they placed their collection of books and other materials on the subject of papermaking in the library at the University of Iowa. The Good Book Press The Good Book Press was a fine press book publisher, founded in 1977 by Peter and Donna Thomas. The proprietors produced the books by hand. Peter Thomas (aka Peter Papermaker) made the paper and Donna Thomas illustrated the books predominantly with linoleum cuts. The Thomases handset the type, letterpress printed the books, and bound the books by hand. Many of their works were sold at the California Renaissance Fair. The Good Book Press specialized in miniature books, often fairy tales or fables. Many were original texts by Peter Thomas. The Good Book Press's final work was their 1987 edition of poet William Everson‚Äôs eulogy for the death of Robinson Jeffers, titled ‚ÄúThe Poet is Dead.‚Äù The introduction of personal computers revolutionized production of fine press books. Artists from different mediums began to explore the books as art. In 1988, declaring that they were no longer publishers, but rather artists working in the medium of the book, Peter and Donna dropped the Good Book Press imprint and began creating their books under their new imprint: Peter and Donna Thomas: Santa Cruz. Conceptual artwork In 2009 Peter and Donna Thomas began a conceptual art project. They created a traveling artists‚Äô book that was structurally based on a British Reading \\"gypsy\\" wagon or vardo, and functioned as a home, a physical artwork and as a metaphoric embodiment of their ideas about the changing nature of the physical book in the digital age. In 2010-2013, the Thomases took their sculptural artists' book on two cross country trips. As ‚ÄúWandering Book Artists‚Äù they presented their traveling artists' book to both academic and community based audiences. While traveling, Peter Thomas began to theorize a typology for all physical artists' books. He classified all physical artists' books by structure, dividing them into four distinct categories: codex, folded, single-sheet, sculptural.1,000 Artist's Books - thestarbook Within this typology, the wagon was a sculptural artists‚Äô book that contained the other three book types. Their work has been exhibited and collected at universities, libraries, galleries, and museums throughout the world, including National Museum of Women in the Arts, New York Public Library, Scripps College, University of Virginia, Smith College, Yale University, Rutgers University, University of California, San Diego, University of California, Santa Cruz, University of Arizona, University of Wisconsin, San Francisco Center for the Book, Victoria and Albert Museum, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, Columbia University, Harvard University, Art Institute of Chicago, The Huntington Library, J. Paul Getty Museum, and Koninklijke Bibliotheek. Education and advocacy In 2004 Quarry Books published their More Making Books by Hand, providing instructions for constructing 12 different binding structures pioneered or developed by the Thomases developed. In 2010 Poetic Matrix Press published their Muir Ramble Route, a guide book for walking from San Francisco, California to Yosemite National Park following the route of John Muir's first trip to Yosemite taken in 1868.California Travel Girl: Following John Muir's footsteps to Yosemite In 2012 Quarry published their 1,000 Artists' Books: Exploring the Book as Art, which they co-authored with Sandra Solomay, grouping the images into the four structural categories Peter had earlier defined. Awards and recognition In 1997 their binding was given special mention for innovative design in the Helen DeGolyer Triennial Exhibition. A Collection of Paper Samples Handmade in the USA was featured by the Guild of Bookworkers as the set book for a national traveling show titled Paper Bound during 1997-1998. In 1997 the Miniature Book Society presented them with the Norman Forgue Award for promoting miniature books. In 1998 and 1999, one of their books was chosen for the Distinguished Book Award. In 2001 their binding of James Joyce's Ulysses was awarded the Judges Distinction for Innovation in the Helen DeGolyer Triennial for American Bookbinding. In 2001, the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History featured their work in a show titled \\"Art Undercover,\\" and in 2010 in a show titled \\"It‚Äôs in the Pulp: The Art of Papermaking in Santa Cruz\\".

The wide area network connections using the ISSI provide an extended coverage area for subscriber units (SUs) that are roaming. The extended coverage area is important for public safety first responders that provide assistance in other jurisdictions during an emergency. The ISSI supports the messaging, and procedures necessary to enable RFSSs to track and locate SUs, set up and teardown calls and transfer voice information to the SUs. The ISSI uses SIP and RTP protocols (standardized protocols) to provide the messaging between RFSSs. The modern Land Mobile Radio (LMR) system includes many features in addition to voice communication. Many features will not work across systems connected using the ISSI. Whether a particular feature will work is determined by the systems and the particular ISSI implementation. Overview of P25 ISSI Documentation Suite The documentation suite which defines Scope One of the P25 ISSI consists of five standards. * ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services * ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services * ISSI Performance Recommendations for Voice Services * ISSI Conformance Testing for Voice Services * ISSI Interoperability Testing for Voice Operations in Trunked Systems A brief overview of each of these standards is provided in the subsections that follow. =ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services= Scope One of the ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services specifies the functional services of mobility management, call control and transmission control to provide trunked voice services for SU-to-SU and Group PTT calls involving multiple RFSSs. Mobility management uses the SIP protocol and describes the messages and procedures necessary for RFSSs to perform registration, and affiliation across the ISSI for roaming SUs. Call control also uses the SIP protocol and describes the messages and procedures necessary for RFSSs to set up and tear down a call, and manage RTP resources. Transmission control uses the RTP protocol and describes the messages and procedures necessary for RFSSs to convey voice information, and manage voice call requests. The functional service responsibilities of an RFSS in a call are dependent upon the type of call and also on the role of the RFSS in a call. The specifications developed in the ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services standard provide the fundamental starting point for the remaining standards in the ISSI suite of standards. =ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services= The ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services is based on the functional services and protocols defined in the ISSI Messages and Procedures for Voice Services standard. Scope One of the ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services provides detailed measurement procedures to measure the ISSI Voice Service (IVS) Call Set-Up Delay (CSD) and IVS Message Transfer Delay (MTD) performance for SU-to-SU and Group calls. IVS-CSD and IVS-MTD performance parameters are used to evaluate the delay associated with successful packet transfers across RFSSs and across the IP backbone connections that link adjacent RFSSs. =ISSI Performance Recommendations for Voice Services= The ISSI Performance Recommendations for Voice Services is a companion standard to the ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services standard. Scope One of the ISSI Performance Recommendations for Voice Services provides agreed upon (by manufacturers and end users) average and maximum values for the IVS-CSD and IVS-MTD performance parameters described in the ISSI Measurement Methods for Voice Services standard. =ISSI Conformance Testing for Voice Services= The ISSI Conformance testing for Voice Services defines a set of procedures to test the conformance between two RF Sub-systems using an IP backbone network. The procedures define reference-signaling sequences for SU-to-SU and Group call scenarios. =ISSI Interoperability Testing for Voice Operations in Trunked Systems= The ISSI Interoperability testing for Voice Operations in Trunked Systems defines procedures to test the interoperability of SUs, and RFSSs from different manufacturers while performing trunked voice operations in configurations that use the ISSI. The trunked voice operations include registration of subscriber units, affiliation of subscriber units to the Subscriber Group Home, initiation of an SU-to-SU call, and initiation of a Group call.

The university has been deprived of license order No.179-07 of January 30, 2017, accreditation cancelled April 26, 2015.http://www.russianenic.ru/english/cred/l-m.html This higher educational institution in Moscow, Russia offers primarily distance-based undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate studies and vocational education. MUH's philosophy is to make available accessible, high-quality education regardless of a student's place of residence. MUH uses an individualized approach based on standardized knowledge control methods to provide students with appropriate levels of academic support. MUH aims at increasing students‚Äô activity during learning process provided with the most up-to-date technologies. Flexible education system is a reliable tool for making learning process truly effective. General management of MUH is performed from its Moscow headquarters. Currently, there are 628 educational centers established within the framework of MUH to support the dissemination of distance learning and correspondence material. These centers are located in the Russian Federation and CIS countries including Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan. MUH also has educational centers outside the former Soviet world, in Vietnam, Israel, China, Peru, and the Czech Republic. Particular attention is focused on extending the geographic coverage of MUH, especially on development in foreign countries. The university currently claims an enrollment of more than 200,000 (2008) students. MUH is the only Russian higher educational institution possessing satellite educational technology. This allows the university the opportunity to provide distance learning resources to every geographic destination in the Russian Federation and in a number of Asian and European countries. MUH possesses satellite educational television with its own teleport for twenty- four-hour, four-channel broadcasting throughout the territory of Russia and the CIS countries. These four channels are also used for data transmission. It is a goal of the university to equip all MUH branches with VSAT-teleports, in order to allow high-quality broadcasting and educational processes between branches and the university's Moscow headquarters. Utilization of video, audio and slide lectures, teaching computer programs and other multimedia products is the primary method of education at MUH. The majority of multimedia educational material is produced by MUH staff in studios equipped with modern computer and recording facilities. The Modern University for the Humanities has eight scientific-research institutes founded within the University. They have specializations which include Educational Programs Development, Educational Technologies Development, Television Education, Computer Education, Study Psychology and Sociology of Education, Mass Media and Publications, Electronic Communication Development, and Students‚Äô Health- Improvement. MUH has a publishing house which issues two newspapers with combined circulation of more than 100,000 copies per month, digests, and a substantial number of popular scientific and educational journals. The total annual run of educational, methodical, and scientific literature at the MUH's publishing house makes up more than 8 million copies of 4,000 titles. MUH is a member of a number of international organizations. In September, 2003 MUH joined Magna Charta Universitatum to start full-fledged integration with the Bologna Process. The University concluded bilateral agreements with a number of foreign universities. Many students from MUH go abroad to take different courses. Most popular are visits to foreign language schools. Among the latest achievements there is an introduction of the Diploma Supplement following the model developed by UNESCO-CEPES, Council of Europe and European Commission where the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) has been used as the core element. Finally, since September, 2005 MUH has been enjoying full-scale cooperation with the Global Development Learning Network (GDLN) of the World Bank. In 2014 and 2015, MUH became a subject of journalist investigations, mostly initiated by Russia-1 TV channel's pundit, Boris Sobolev. According to \\"Special Correspondent\\" TV program, quality of distance learning was in doubt despite heavy advertising campaign, as lectures and examinations at the institution are replaced by video translations and computer tests respectively. During test on knowledge of Constitution of Russia, one of the jurisprudence students failed to know the number of articles there, while the other was not able to remember content of the Article 1. Also, according to the program, auditoria for study were placed in buildings not adapted for studying, which happened in one of MUH's branch institutions in Vyazma. That branch was closed before 2012, after Rosobrnadzor expelled MUH's license for \\"extremely low level of education\\", but, according to Sobolev, it still worked as of 2012, still being located in technical building. On 27 February 2014, Rosobrnadzor published a list of 126 institutions which were stripped of their educational licenses, 51 of which were MUH's branches also.

They recorded under a variety of names, including Big John and the Buzzards, the Crackerjacks, the Lee Brothers, and the Ravenscroft Quartet. They were sometimes credited as the Mellowmen, the Mello Men, or the Mellow Men. They sang backup to some of the best-known artists of the day, including Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Arlo Guthrie, Frankie Laine, Peggy Lee, Elvis Presley, and Jo Stafford. In addition to backing up popular singers, they also were featured vocalists for bandleaders like Spike Jones and their solo work is part of many Disney films including Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Lady and the Tramp and The Jungle Book as well as numerous animated shorts, including Trick or Treat (1952), Pigs Is Pigs (1954), Paul Bunyan (1958), and Noah's Ark (1959). Their work for Disney also led to numerous television appearances, beginning with the Disneyland television show episode Cavalcade of Songs, originally broadcast February 16, 1955. The Mellomen were also featured frequently on Disneyland Records, which released their 1957 album Meet Me Down on Main Street. They also sang \\"The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh\\" theme and the introduction of Zorro. Henry Calvin, who portrayed Sergeant Garcia on that television series, also sang and released a version of the \\"Zorro\\" theme song. (A longer version of the Zorro Theme, recorded by the female quartet, the Chordettes, became a Top Ten hit). This quartet performed singing voices for the elephants along with J. Pat O'Malley in The Jungle Book. The group were also the \\"singing busts\\" in the graveyard of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion ride, and sang the recording of \\"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\\" used in Disneyland's Pirates of the Caribbean ride. The Mellomen were also featured in the UPA animated feature Gay Purr-ee which starred Judy Garland as the voice of a beautiful cat named Mewsette and included songs by Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg. The film was released by Warner Brothers in 1962. In addition, they sang on several films with Elvis Presley, beginning with It Happened at the World's Fair. Elvis wanted the Jordanaires to perform for the film but they were unavailable, so the Mellomen were called in to sing One Broken Heart For Sale and Cotton Candy Land. The Mellomen later backed up Elvis on the title song for the film Roustabout as well as on most of the sound track for Paradise, Hawaiian Style. In 1969, the Mellomen appeared with Elvis in the film The Trouble with Girls, as a gospel group called the Bible Singers.

It began in the West Epping Uniting Church.Living without so others can live , Kent Crawford, Insights magazine (online), accessed 2009-02-08 White perceived a temptation to help people in underdeveloped countries and, to raise money, proposed a variation on the Christian habit of giving up luxuries for Lent by asking people to donate the value of their forgone luxury.

Lent Event is partnered with Uniting Church Overseas Aid (UCOA), an arm of the Uniting Church in Australia, and is supported by UnitingCare Australia.
