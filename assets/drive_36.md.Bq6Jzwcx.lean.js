It is located near the centre of the town, as the crow flies just over a kilometre to the south-east of the Essen main railway station. It is bounded by the thoroughfares Kronprinzenstrasse, Ruhrallee, T√∂pferstrasse and Rellinghauserstasse and by the railway line from Essen Main Station to Essen-Werden (S6 rapid transit link to D√ºsseldorf and Cologne). Administratively, it belongs to the urban districts of Essen-S√ºdostviertel and Essen-Huttrop. The centre point of the Moltkeviertel is the Robert-Schmidt- Berufskolleg (vocational college), formerly the K√∂nigliche Baugewerkschule (Royal Building College) Essen, at the corner of Moltkestrasse and Robert- Schmidt-Strasse.  Town planning  In terms of town planning, the Moltkeviertel was conceived at the beginning of the 20th century as a single unit. As a response to the lack of high-quality residential housing in the up- and-coming and prosperous city of Essen, it was planned by the visionary town planner and city councillor Professor Robert Schmidt following principles which are partly still relevant today and were at that time revolutionary. This included, among other things, the creation of broad urban ventilation lanes in the form of wide streets and cohesive green zones. The notions behind these extended parks in the immediate vicinity of the houses, sometimes with large playing and sporting areas ‚Äì the tennis courts were planned as early as 1908 ‚Äì were essentially reformative in character and these facilities are still very much in use today. The naming of the quarter's streets after great master builders such as Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Gottfried Semper, Joseph Maria Olbrich and others testifies to the great esteem in which architecture was held. On the other hand, the idea of giving the quarter's largest street and largest square the name of the Prussian field marshal Helmuth Karl Bernhard Graf von Moltke is more a reflection of the prevailing zeitgeist between the turn of the century and the First World War.  Reform architecture  From 1908 on, the roughly half a square kilometre site purchased by the City was developed: splendid mansions were constructed, as were semi-detached and terraced houses and company head offices, built according to individual plans and to suit the respective owner's finances ‚Äì in the style of Reform Architecture (German: Reformarchitektur) throughout. With a clock tower towering above everything, the K√∂nigliche Baugewerkschule (Royal Building College) Essen, the centrepiece of the quarter, was constructed between 1908 and 1911.Memorial plaque at the building The Staatliche Ingenieurschule f√ºr Bauwesen (State Civil Engineering College) later occupied the building, and this was succeeded by the Kaufm√§nnische Schule III der Stadt Essen (Commercial College III of the City of Essen) on 30 August 1982. This was renamed to Robert-Schmidt-Berufskolleg (Robert Schmidt Vocational College) in August 2000.Website of the Robert-Schmidt-Berufskollegs, Geschichte/History Georg Metzendorf, Edmund K√∂rner and other prominent architects created in the immediate vicinity architecture for the prosperous middle classes, architecture which at that time provided residences of a high, sometimes the highest standard ‚Äì especially in the form of prestigious mansions. Even after a hundred years, they constitute a desirable residential quarter. At Moltkeplatz, Otto Bartning built his first church in Germany (consecrated in 1910) for the Old Lutheran parish (now SELK ‚Äì Independent Lutheran Church). Subsequently, he designed the nearby Church of the Resurrection (Auferstehungskirche), built in 1929, which is one of the most important models for modern church construction in central Europe. At the corner of Moltkestrasse and Camillo-Sitte-Platz, the building housing the residence and studio (subsequently only the studio) of Edmund K√∂rner was constructed in 1928/29, exhibiting both elements of the Neues Bauen movement and industrial structures, such as at the mine site Zeche Zollverein. Many of the old buildings and the Moltke Bridge are listed monuments. A major portion of the quarter has been subject to a preservation statute since 1983, something to which the quarter's \\"traditionally self-confident residents\\" are highly committed. file:Moltkebruecke_1910.jpgMoltke Bridge; picture taken in 1910 file:Moltkebruecke_1480_A.jpgMoltke Bridge; today file:Moltkebr√ºcke_Putte_2449.JPGSculptures on the Moltke Bridge over the S-Bahn rapid transit line file:Moltkebr√ºcke_2137_E.jpgArt nouveau railings next to the Moltke Bridge file:Moltkeviertel_1429_2.jpgRobert Schmidt Vocational College (formerly the Royal Building College) file:Kirche am Moltkeplatz.jpgIndependent Lutheran Church SELK at Moltkeplatz file:Villa_Koppers_1502.JPGMoltkeplatz; former residence of the Heinrich Koppers family file:Moltkeviertel_1442_2.jpgMoltkestrasse; former administrative building of the Heinrich Koppers company file:Moltkeviertel_1444_2.jpgUpper Schinkelstrasse file:Moltkeviertel_1500_N.JPGPrivate houses: Messelstrasse file:Moltkeviertel_1445_2.jpgResidence and studio of the architect Edmund K√∂rner file:Moltkeviertel_1463_2.jpgEssen was once a mining town: hammer and pick emblem over the entrance to a house in Schinkelstrasse file:Moltkeviertel_1470_2.jpgResidence at junction Semperstrasse/Dammannstrasse file:Moltkeviertel_1459_2.jpgLower Ruhrallee file:Moltkeviertel_1478_2.jpgThe northern Moltkeplatz; with stele by Jo Sch√∂pfer and exterior work Blue Pigment by Katja Hajek View over the Wiebe- Anlage park from the south-east (2009)  Green spaces  Alongside the parks and the many old trees, the large front gardens provided for in Robert Schmidt's plans for the houses help make the Moltkeviertel into a garden city, especially when seen from above. But in contrast to a garden city in the original form, in the Moltkeviertel there is no spatial separation of working and living areas. Rather the workplaces ‚Äì primarily educational, medical, administrative, engineering consulting and legal practices ‚Äì are cheek by jowl with residential buildings. In a publication of the Bund Deutscher Architekten (German Architects' Federation) and the city of Essen dated 2004 (see below) it is stated that the Moltkeviertel was originally planned for approximately 4,000 residents and approximately 3,000 workplaces. In the southern part of the Moltkeviertel, work started in 1925 on creating an unusual park in the form of the so-called Wiebe-Anlage ‚Äì the first of its kind in Germany. This public park is located in an area enclosed by a block of houses. The back gardens of the individual houses border directly on the park with its children's playground and green areas.  Contemporary art  Offering a sharp visual contrast to the adjacent terrace of old houses in the northern section of Moltkeplatz, the Essen gallery owner Jochen Kr√ºper (died 2002) together with Uwe R√ºth (formerly director of the Glaskasten Sculpture Museum Marl), began in 1981 to assemble on the Moltkeplatz green a high quality ensemble of contemporary sculptures (see Literature). It includes major works by Heinz Breloh, Christa Feuerberg, Hannes Forster, Gloria Friedmann, Lutz Fritsch, Friedrich Gr√§sel, Ansgar Nierhoff, and Ulrich R√ºckriem. These are now preserved and cared for under a sponsorship agreement by the association Kunst am Moltkeplatz e.V., which was formed by local residents. Alongside these permanent exhibits, the project \\"junge Kunst am Moltkeplatz\\" (young Art at Moltkeplatz) was started in 2010 which presents, for a fixed period in each case, a selected work of a young artist. At other locations in the Moltkeviertel, it is also possible to see contemporary art works in an external setting ‚Äì for example at the corner of Moltkestrasse and Schinkelstrasse, sometimes on private land such as in the central section of Semperstrasse, and at the northern end of Moltkeplatz. file:Moltkeviertel_1241_2.jpg‚Ä¶ Heinz Breloh, Friedrich Gr√§sel and Hannes Forster under 100-year-old plane trees file:Moltkeviertel_0096_2.jpg‚Ä¶ Hannes Forster aligned towards the Lutheran Church (SELK), the first church building built by the architect Otto Bartning in Germany file:Moltkeviertel_1262_2.jpg‚Ä¶ Ansgar Nierhoff and Hannes Forster file:Moltkeviertel_0741_2.jpg‚Ä¶ Friedrich Gr√§sel and Gloria Friedmann  Significant buildings  At Schinkelstrasse No. 34, there stands the former residence of Gustav Heinemann, Essen's first elected mayor after the Second World War and the third President of the Federal Republic of Germany.Plaque by the house Moltkestrasse No. 31 is the Essen branch of the Deutsche Bundesbank (German Federal Bank). The hospital of the Huyssens Foundation on Henricistrasse and the Elisabeth Hospital on the opposite side of the Ruhrallee, together with their neighbouring medical facilities, constitute a major medical welfare and treatment complex. The Villa Koppers, Moltkeplatz No. 61, the former residence of the industrialist Heinrich Koppers, now houses the International School Ruhr. In the year of the RUHR.2010 European Capital of Culture, the Independent Lutheran Church SELK parish celebrated the 100th anniversary of its listed church building designed by Otto Bartning. Later in the same year the residents at Moltkeplatz commemorated the naming of the square 100 years ago.

It is located south-southwest of Keno, Oregon. It was closed in 1979 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-82. History Keno Air Force Station came into existence as part of Phase III of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. On October 20, 1953 ADC requested a third phase of twenty-five radar sites be constructed. The site was located east of the Cascade mountains to provide coverage of the air refueling tracks in Northern California. In 1957, 306 acres of land were acquired for DoD use at the new site. The 827th Aircraft Warning and Control Squadron was assigned to the new station on 1 February 1958.Cornett & Johnson, p. 171 Logistical support and housing for personnel was provided by Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, thirteen miles to the east. The squadron initially began operations with an AN/FPS-20A search radar and a pair of AN/FPS-6A height-finder radars (one east hemisphere coverage, and one west). A Ground- Air Transmit/Receive site (GATR) was co-located on the site, with antennas favoring the south toward the air refueling tracks in California. Initially the station functioned as a Ground Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1960 Keno became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), performing air-traffic-control duties. In 1961 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-67. During 1962 Keno AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-13 at Adair AFS, Oregon. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 827th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 December 1962. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1963 an AN/FPS-90 replaced the east hemisphere coverage AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar, and the search radar was further upgraded to the AN/FPS-67B version. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-180. In addition to the main facility, Keno operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Yreka, CA (TM-180A) * La Pine, OR (TM-180B) Routine operations continued until 1 March 1970 when the 827th Radar Squadron was inactivated and replaced by the 827th Air Defense Group, operating the BUIC installation.Cornett, & Johnson, p.86 The upgrade to group status was done because of Kingsley Field's status as a Backup Interceptor Control (BUIC) site. BUIC sites were alternate control sites in the event that SAGE Direction Centers became disabled and unable to control interceptor aircraft. The group was inactivated and replaced by the 827th Radar Squadron. as defenses against manned bombers were reduced. The group was disbanded in 1984.Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 575q, 27 Sep 1984, Subject: Disbandment of Units Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The Radar Squadron was inactivated 1 October 1979 when operations reverted to an Operating Location of the 25th Air Division at McChord AFB. At the time of its BUIC III inactivation in 1976, the 827th manned the last operating BUIC III in the western United States. In 1976 the AN/FPS-90 was removed and sent to the new Joint Surveillance System (JSS) site J-81 which is 12 miles west of Dallas, Oregon on Laurel Mountain, where it became operational in 1980 until replaced by a 3D ARSR-4 FAA radar. The remaining height-finder radar, upgraded to an AN/FPS-116, was retired c. 1988 and the station closed, and property transferred to the FAA. In the early 1990s, the abandoned station buildings at the former Keno AFS were removed (including the sewage lagoon) and most of the site has been returned to its natural state. Today, only the FAA unattended search radar is functional.

Late in his career, Bowman saw action as a relief pitcher, as well. He batted and threw right-handed, standing and weighing , during his playing days. Bowman attended Abraham Lincoln High School (San Jose, California) and played right field for the Phillies from 1955 to 1958 and was noted for his strong throwing arm. The Phillies briefly tried converting Bowman to pitcher in 1959 when they were short arms in the bull pen. He made his first appearance pitching against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 28. Bowman's first pitch was hit out by Smoky Burgess, but Bowman went on to pitch the rest of the game with two scoreless innings. He appeared six times overall in the majors. His only decision came on September 18, his final appearance in the major leagues, losing to the Chicago Cubs, 5‚Äì4, with Alvin Dark hitting a RBI double to score the winning run in the bottom of the 13th inning. When he returned to the minor leagues in 1960, he also returned to the outfield, pitching just four more times. Bowman holds two major league records with the highest pinch hitting batting average in 1958 and most pitching appearances as a position player with six appearances in 1959. Bowman died in 2017 in San Jose, California, at the age of 86.

This Airstrip was constructed by MIDC in 1996, at a distance of 12 km from Baramati city/ Baramati railway station. It is currently being used for General aviation and pilot training. Description Elevation of the airfield is 604 metres MSL and is spread over an area of 182.5 hectares (451.11 Acres). The Runway 11/29 is 1770 metres long and 30 metres wide with turning pads at both ends. The Runway Strength is 16 LCN. Three taxiways connects the airstrip to two adjacent aprons measuring 180 by 100 metres and 100 by 75 metres. The airport has a 112 square metre terminal building and approach road.http://www.baramatiairport.co.in/aboutus.html Airport website Facilities The airport has an advisory tower (Freq.=129.25 MHz). The tower is managed by senior pilots from the adjacent Academy of Carver Aviation Pvt. Ltd. flight school. The senior pilots monitor traffic in the local airspace and give advisories over VHF frequency to the pilots flying in circuits and around the area. The main Apron parking capacity is 100 M x 75 M. There are currently no navigational nor visual aids nor night landing facilities available on the airstrip other than the VHF communication and the windsock. Advisory tower at Baramati Airport. Capital C indicates reporting place for pilots and other aviation personnel. 11 indicates that Runway 11 is in use. Future Plans Reliance Airport Developers, an Anil Ambani group company, who had won a bid two years ago to run five airports, including Baramati, in Maharashtra on a 95-year lease, plans to develop Baramati as a hub for private jets, with airports in Mumbai and Pune facing acute shortage of parking bays. The apron at Baramati can safely accommodate 15 to 20 private jets. Accidents and incidents On 14 March 2008, a Cessna-152, VT-ACC crashed into the Nira river south of the airport. The student pilot, carrying an unauthorized female passenger on a solo training sortie, had descended from the assigned altitude to do low flying over the river for fun. Having descended to around 50 ft above the river, the pilot failed to notice high tension electrical cables stretched across the river and as a result, the main landing gear got entangled in the cables and the aircraft crashed into the river. Both occupants sustained minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. On 5 February 2019, a Cessna 172, VT-RDX crashed near Indapur, Pune. The flight was a normal training session for a trainee pilot who took off at around 12:30 IST. The cause of the crash remains a snag in the engine which lost him some altitude at around 3500 feet due to which the pilot tried to land on a road. However, the aircraft crash-landed off it, hitting some trees. No casualties were reported on the ground. The plane crash-landed around 100 feet from a village locality and more than 400 feet from a school. The pilot sustained a right hand fracture and minor injuries, to which he was later taken to the hospital. The aircraft sustained crucial damage and is more likely to be written off. https://indianexpress.com/article/india/trainee- pilot-injured-as-aircraft-crash-lands-5571068/ See also *Pune Airport *New Pune International Airport * Guru Gobind Singhji Airport - Nanded * Latur Airport * Baramati Airport * Osmanabad Airport * Yavatmal airport References Category:Airports in Pune district Category:Baramati ","title":"Baramati Airport"},{"id":"30640834","text":"Kyle is a unisex English-language given name, derived from the Scottish Gaelic surname Kyle, which is itself from a region in Ayrshire (from the Scottish Gaelic caol \\"narrow, strait\\").

Tiger parents push and pressure their children to attain high levels of academic achievement or success in high-status extracurricular activities such as music, using authoritarian parenting methods. The term \\"tiger mother\\" (\\"tiger mom\\") was coined by Yale Law School professor Amy Chua in her 2011 memoir Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. A largely Chinese-American concept, the term draws parallels to strict parenting styles ostensibly common to households in East Asia, South Asia and Southeast Asia. The rise of Amy Chua's memoir brought the tiger parent phenomenon into the American mainstream during the 2010s. The tiger parent is a neostereotype of modern Chinese society, as well as in overseas Chinese communities around the world. Chua's rise to fame quickly popularized the concept and term \\"tiger parent\\" spawning numerous caricatures while also becoming the inspiration for the 2014‚Äì2015 Singaporean TV show Tiger Mum, the 2015 mainland Chinese drama Tiger Mom, and the 2017 Hong Kong series Tiger Mom Blues. The stereotype is a Chinese mother who relentlessly drives her child to study hard, without regard for the child's social and emotional development. The tiger parent is analogous to other parenting stereotypes such as the American stage mother who demands her child achieve career success in Hollywood, or the Japanese ky≈çiku mama who expends enormous effort directing the development of her children's educational and intellectual achievement, or the Jewish mother who drives her children to succeed academically and professionally, all to the detriment of the child's self-esteem. History and origin The origin of the concept, term, and neologism traces its roots in ancient Confucian teachings articulated through classical anthologies such as the Analects of Confucius written more than two millennia ago. The concept is influenced by Confucianism, an ancient Chinese philosophy developed by the philosopher Confucius in the 5th century BC that promoted attributes such as filial piety, family values, hard work, enduring hardship, honesty, and dedicating oneself towards academic excellence through the pursuit of knowledge. As Chinese and East Asian society have been influenced by the thought of the ancient Chinese scholar, his teachings still plays a role in attitudes toward education in East Asia. Many contemporary Chinese families strive to inculcate the value and importance of an education in their child at a young age. Higher education is an overwhelmingly serious issue in Chinese society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of Chinese culture and life. Education is regarded with a high priority for Chinese families as success in education holds a cultural status as well as a necessity to improve one's socioeconomic position in Chinese society. These values are embedded deeply in Chinese culture, parent-child relations and parents' expectations for their children. For the Chinese, the importance of education was considered a crucial means for channeling one's upward social mobility in ancient and medieval Chinese societies. In contemporary Mainland China, national examinations such as the Gaokao remain the primary path for channeling one's upward social mobility. Characteristics While \\"tiger mother\\" is a generic term for the tiger parenting phenomenon, representing a concept that was not commonly known until the publication of Chua's book, the broader phrase \\"tiger parenting\\" also acknowledges the fact that fathers or other parent-figures can also instigate, participate in, or be accomplices to the behavior. Western parenting tries to respect and nurture children's individualism while Chinese parents believe that arming children with in- demand job skills such as mathematical and scientific proficiency, strong work habits, and inner confidence prepares them best for the future. =Harsh regime= Parents who set up rules that overstep conventional parental boundaries are regarded as either tiger mothers or (less commonly) tiger fathers. Tiger parents prioritize schoolwork above all else and only allow children to participate in activities in order to potentially win awards which they believe will increase the chance of the child's acceptance to the elite universities. Tiger parents constantly propel their children towards their commitment towards excellence. In a similar way, Chinese tiger parents pay more attention to students core academic subjects such as math, science, and language arts and often ignore other non-academic activities such as art and sports in order to ensure their children's superior performance in their core academic subjects. =Demanding= Tiger parents emphasize a commitment towards excellence in academia and award-winning non-academic achievements such as performing classical music instruments. Some also choose to incorporate competitive sports for their children. This unusually high level of expectations may stem from parental love and care, as well as a strong desire to pave the way for their children's future success, as playing an instrument or being proficient in a competitive sport often serves as a cosmetic addition of extracurricular activities that may look good on college applications. Many Chinese tiger parenting families have a huge emphasis on academic achievement. Extrinsic rewards play a role in the Confucian cultural value system Chinese parents communicate and inculcate in their children at a young age. The strong emphasis on high academic achievement is often seen as a source of stress for Western parents while Chinese parents see the stress of academic achievement on their children as a sign of good parenting reinforced by the entire Confucian cultural value system. =Psychological and behavioral control= Tiger parents try to reinforce higher levels of psychological and behavioral control over their children than other parents. Tempering a child's self-esteem may be part of this strategy. Psychological control comes in many forms but it rooted when parents work to constrain children's autonomy through psychologically manipulative tactics such as the withdrawal of love or induction of guilt. While behavioral control is focused on setting limits on children's activities, often referring to academics and limiting behavioral problems. In Chua's memoir, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, she mentions an incident that she yelled at her daughters, calling them 'garbage' in public. It has been shown that tiger parents are less likely than other parents to compliment their children in public as well. Children raised by tiger parents may be met with emotional threats and physical punishments if they failed to practice their piano scales and meet their expectations. Moreover, some tiger parents do not allow their children to make some decisions on their own, whether in academia or daily life. For instance, Chua's daughters were not allowed to watch TV at night or have sleepovers with their schoolmates. =High expectations and commitment to excellence= Chua cites her parents' newfound immigration experience in the United States and intense struggle to set their roots in a foreign land as the reason inevitably prompting them to adopt a more utilitarian approach towards raising their children. In her memoir, Chua brings up Confucius to elucidate why Chinese parents feel that their children are indebted to them due to all the sacrifices the previous parental generation made to secure a better life for their children. Tiger parents enforce high expectations and may harbor snobbish and inflated views regarding their children's academic performance. In some cases these expectations may be held unrealistically high regardless of the child's ability or passion for studying. Tiger parents may exhibit harsh and unrealistic expectations for the child's academic performance where \\"B\\" and even mid to low end \\"A\\" grades are not tolerated. Tiger parents put a heavy emphasis on the pursuit of academic success at the expense of other character traits that are just as crucial for future career success such as soft skills, social skills, dealing with people, and emotional intelligence. Tiger parents eschew the lax parenting style typically exhibited by many liberal Western parents but also disregard other soft skills that are just as crucial for their children's future career prospects and the lack of such skills may put them at a disadvantage when competing for job positions. Tiger parents may impose choices on their children as to which interests they choose to pursue. Critics of the tiger parenting argue that this approach will restrict their children's ability to discover their individual talents and passions thus denying the child a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and purpose. On the other hand, proponents for tiger parenting argue that their parenting strategy imbues children with self-control, self-regulation and self-discipline and won't produce excellent academic results if they let their child to drift freely to develop their own interests. Chinese Confucian philosophy has traditionally emphasized self-improvement. As a result, tiger parents often make sure that their children work conscientiously on their schoolwork to help secure better grades and an overall superior academic performance. =Exam- oriented education= East Asian countries often adopt a strict exam-oriented approach in teaching, which encourages rote memorization. Some argue that this approach encourages uniformity while eschewing creativity, questioning, student participation, self-determination, autonomy, diversity and critical or independent thinking. Tiger parents often put children in tutorial classes as early as the preschool stage. Typically, throughout the child's academic career, the mother's attempts to help the child obtain outstanding results in exams to secure a seat in prestigious schools, with the end goal of entering a top-notch university in mind. =Cultural influences= In East Asian societies, a higher education level is perceived as a guarantee of promising career prospects and as a tool to climb up the socioeconomic ladder or to lift a family out of poverty. In the classical Chinese anthologies Analects of Confucius by the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius in the 5th century BC, education is a central theme in the book with philosophical ideas and sayings that placed great value on work ethic and the pursuit of knowledge. The Confucian ideal argued that education is a passport to higher socioeconomic status and wealth. In ancient and medieval East Asian societies, scholar- officials had a high social status and intellectuals were held in high esteem, well above than that of wealthy landowners, businessmen, and merchants. Thus, tiger parents pin high hope on their children, taking much pride in their children's academic achievements and may flaunt them to other parents when comparing their own children with the academic achievements of others. Chinese immigrant parents in the West argue that \\"high academic achievement\\" reflects \\"successful parenting\\" while parents who have children that bring home inferior academic records are seen as irresponsible parents who are not doing their job. One historical explanation for the strict examination approach stems from the Imperial examination system of China for civil service government positions. Success in the civil examination administered by the royal court was seen as a sure conduit improve a family's socioeconomic position. Since such positions were scarce with many applicants applying for few opening positions, competition was fierce and these positions were highly coveted, as only a select few could succeed and attain them. Tiger parents recognize how crucial self-discipline is in gaining success, so they may try to instill the value of an exam oriented education into their children as early as possible. =Views on success and achievement= Tiger parents perceive a narrow definition of success that is rooted solely in a high level of academic and intellectual achievement. As academic success is often a source of pride for families and within Chinese and East Asian society at large, tiger parents typically view \\"success\\" as graduating from a top university such as Harvard, or other Ivy League institutions as the ultimate marker of prestige, granting high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a highly respectable lucrative white collar career path such as becoming a high-end neurosurgeon for Mayo Clinic, a high-powered lawyer at a top law Wall Street law firm, a software engineer in Silicon Valley, a management consultant for Boston Consulting Group, or as an investment banker working for Goldman Sachs. Tiger mothers also incorporate classical music training or extracurricular enrichment activities such as joining a sports team, including those with competitive structures and awards systems to bolster their child's university entrance application. This kind of early life training illustrates the tiger parent's zeal for education and the desire for their children to get into a prestigious university as tiger parents see the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution as a ticket that leads to a prestigious, rewarding, and lucrative white collar career filled with socioeconomic success. Tiger parents may look down on careers beneath their expectations - that is a truck driver may be viewed as less socially respectable than a neurosurgeon. Effects Advocates suggest a strict approach to parenting produces an exceptionally high proportion of top performers ‚Äì children who display academic excellence across the board with great musical ability and professional success later in life. In a three-part series on competition in Hong Kong's education system by the South China Morning Post, many Hong Kong parents revealed that cultural fears over economic hardship motivated them to begin thinking of their children's futures as professionals soon after birth, striving to find the best playgroups, and encouraging competition among children in academics, sports and music, in the belief that this fosters competitiveness and increases their children's chances of entering a better pre-nursery school and elite kindergarten, and determine their eventual success at primary schools, secondary schools and universities. However, many other Hong Kong parents, psychologists and educators assert that pushing children too hard does not work, and can even harm children. There is a growing trend of children aged five to 12 seeking psychiatric help and even contemplating suicide. In reaction, some parents have relaxed their formerly strict discipline with their children, and some schools have modified their admissions requirements to be less demanding. According to some sources, children raised under a strict, controlling, and punitive tiger mother will suffer a chronic social and psychological toll. The affected children include not only those residing in Asia, but some children from immigrant families of Asian ancestry who live in other parts of the world outside Asia. Children raised with a less supportive type of parenting have developed chronic mental health and psychiatric problems such as anxiety, low self-esteem, depression, and contemplation of suicide. These mental health and psychiatric problems may create psychological problems that make these children feel like \\"failures\\". When parents do not provide coping strategies to their children and guide alongside to manage negative feelings, such loneliness may transition into depression and suicide. Tiger parenting has been blamed for high rates of suicide in East Asia, particularly South Korea, which has some of the highest suicide rates in the developed world. In South Korea, stress from constant study and limited social life pressured by harsh and demanding parents on a student may be taking a psychological and social toll on younger generations, causing an increase in aggression, mental health problems, impaired cognitive development, and drug and alcohol abuse. Other adverse effects, such as depression, anxiety, antisocial behavior, and increased risk of physical abuse, have also been linked to the increasing amount of academic pressure placed on young South Koreans. Tiger parents' belief in the importance of academics for their children is considered by many to constitute child abuse, but is seen as acceptable by many Asian parents. Many have described their traditions as including physical and emotional closeness that ensures a lifelong bond between parent and child, as well as establishing parental authority and child obedience through discipline.Lau, A. S., Takeuchi, D. T., & Alegr√≠a, M. (2006). Parent-to-child aggression among Asian American parents: Culture, context, and vulnerability. Journal of Marriage and Family, 68(5), 1261‚Äì1275. Retrieved Use of violence within parenting is common in many Asian cultures, including China, Pakistan, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Outside of Asia, violent parenting is recognized as child abuse, but is considered parental devotion within cultures where it is accepted. Severe forms of violence may include spanking or slapping the child with an open hand or striking with an available household implement such as a belt, slipper, cane, clothes hanger, meter stick, hairbrush, paddle or bamboo feather duster. According to the sources cited by the website Parenting Science, children from authoritarian families may find it more difficult to fend for themselves and make friends, but whether or not most families with a tiger parent could be considered authoritarian is a matter of debate. Studies published by the Handbook of Child Psychology have shown that children under tiger parenting were rated as less helpful and less popular by their teachers and classmates. Also, they are more likely to show aggressive behavior towards others when they are forced to learn without recess. They were rated as less self-reliant and are not able to be independent thinkers since their life is organized by their parents. According to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, tiger parenting could bring benefits to their children economically. The strict rules and high standards that tiger parents establish, if done correctly, develop their children to live by these high standards. Children of tiger parents who go by these high standards start to make choices that are preferred by tiger parents throughout their life. They start to value academia/award-winning non-academic successes and hard work more. This leads to Asian Americans from authoritarian families to be more successful if they continue to go by these values.

The relationship between the Paris police and the general populace during his period of office was one of mutual disrespect and Loz√©‚Äôs tenure did very little to change this perception although in 1890 there was a notable success in the discovery and destruction of a Russian nihilist plot to assassinate Alexander III of Russia. http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/russian-works-art-faberge- icons-l14113/lot.636.html Faberg√© Watch Gift from Alexander III to Loz√© for Sale with Sotheby's. When in 1893 major riots broke out in Paris after a confrontation between a student called Nuger and a policeman that resulted in Nuger suffering a fatal wound, Riots that took place in July 1893 arose out of a seemingly trivial incident involving the arrest of an actress Sarah Brown, a student called Nuger and a confrontation with a policeman, the consequence of which was the death of Nuger. On the following Monday, 1,000 demonstrators marched onto the Chamber of Deputies, determined to be provided with an adequate explanation. By the end of the day barricades were erected around the district of the Boulevard St. Germain and Paris seemed on the brink of revolution.L√©pine, Famous Paris Chief of Police, To Retire\\", The New York Times, February 25, 1913 there was widespread public concern that the governance of Paris and ultimately the French Republic was being endangered by the increasing public disorder in the Capital. Loz√© was heavily criticised for perceived inaction during the disturbances and on 11 July he was replaced as Prefect of Police by the authoritarian Louis L√©pine who is credited with restoring order and subsequently implementing the reforms required for policing a Modern French state.Jean Marc Berliere, L‚Äôinstitution policiere sous la IIIeme Republique, Dijon 1991 Political career Loz√© was next appointed France‚Äôs ambassador to Vienna a position he held for four years until 1897. In September of that year he served as the temporary Governor- General of Algeria but though he was named in the post he declined to take the job on a permanent basis preferring a low key post in the Ministry of the Interior. He was replaced in Algeria once again by Louis L√©pine. By 1902 Loz√© was representing the Commune of Cambrai in the National Assembly. His political actions during this period were compatible with a man of libertarian and liberal inclinations. He is recorded as opposing the lien securities that favoured distillers and speaking in favour of increased decentralisation of powers to the communes. On 3 July he voted against the bill separating the church from the state.https://francearchives.fr/facomponent/a1d81d1f79701d961a17b89d3a53ff71e4ac1944 France National Archives (Portail National Des Archives) In 1906 after a close fought election Loz√© was elected to the Senate where he served until his death in 1915.

His family ran a newspaper titled the \\"India Purtuguesa\\", which was an avenue for Goans troubled by the Portuguese rule. He was known to his friends as ‚ÄúAlu‚Äù. Though, neither the news paper nor his columns can be classified as anti-Portuguese, he brought about a new chapter where Goans could criticize and lash out at the Portuguese regime and bring its lapses to the fore. Coming from the Loyola- Furtado family, which was instrumental in assuring civil rights to Goans, equal to the rights enjoyed by people in Portugal, he worked extra hard is ensuring that Goans were treated in equilibrium with the \\"Pakle\\" or, the \\"white people\\". While Jose Inacio de Loiola and Francisco Luis Gomes ensured that legislations were passed to ensure civil rights, Furtado ensured that enough Goans were aware of such legislations and enough Goans worked to uphold them. His stature normally arose to greater cultural heights at carnival times, with \\"khell tiatres\\" staged all over the place, specially from the of his ancestral home at Chinchinim. A lawyer by profession, he died in 1946 at a young age of 33, but was remembered by his surviving contemporaries as a legal luminary. He left behind his widow and three minor sons. *Of his three sons, the eldest, Miguel (Mick), was South Goa's cultural hero, leading many a carnival parade, making sure that Goa's great \\"antique\\" culture stayed alive. With many a painting, public show, and amusement extravaganza, he did all he could to keep Goa's and Chinchinim's great cultural presence alive. He was known for his carnival \\"out of the box\\" performances and vignettes. He died in 1998. *His second son, Rajendra, a lawyer, took a different route, when he en route to establishing a good legal practice, accepted the post as the Court Receiver of the Sociedade Agricola dos Gauncares de Cuncolim, also known as the Cuncolim Condade (County of Cuncolim), In this capacity, he took it upon himself to ensure that the age old system of the Sociedade Agricola dos Gauncares de Cuncolim stayed alive, specially in times when there was a danger of the same disappearing as evacuee property. People in Cuncolim, specially the ever-decreasing politically conscious senior citizens still remember Rajendra as the person responsible for keeping Cuncolim and the Cuncolim way of life alive, as it is today. Rajendra died suddenly on 30 November 2011, much to the dismay of the people of Cuncolim, dependent on the Sociedade. *His third son, Guido, took the modern route as he became a civil engineer and a real estate builder.

In the modern era, Dominique Lafon, grandson of Count Lafon, participates in and helps organize the event.

Born on 2 November 1936, he originated from the Antrim Road district of north Belfast. He was educated at Methodist College Belfast and The Queen's University, Belfast, graduating with a degree in psychology.  Broadcasting career  Smyth was a school teacher and was an educational psychologist, before embarking as a broadcaster in the 1960s at the BBC Northern Ireland Home Service, which later became known as BBC Radio Ulster. In the early 1970s Bill was employed with BBC Radio Bristol, in the west of England. When Northern Ireland's first commercial radio station, Downtown Radio, went on air in March 1976, Bill was one of its original presenters, working on the shows Downtown Downbeat and The Sunday Request Show. 1978 saw his move into television broadcasting when he joined the popular Northern Ireland ITV licence holder Ulster Television as a Newscaster and Continuity Announcer, a move that made him one of Havelock House's famous celebrities and household names. He remained with the station until 1987. Thereafter, the father of four daughters, worked as a journalist with the Antrim Guardian. He also spent some time at Townland Radio in Cookstown, Co. Tyrone, and in 1997 moved to Belfast Community Radio/Citybeat. In addition to his sports reporting for the Irish News, the Ulster edition of The Mirror and other publications, he was a travel news announcer with emerging Belfast radio station U105 (2005‚Äì2010) launched by UTV Media plc, one of the largest media organisations in the UK and Ireland, which grew out of Bill's former employer, Ulster Television. In 2009, however, he narrated 'The Old Road to Dublin' by Belfast-based indie Notassuch Films, a documentary film and online comedy about 'social attitudes, improved infrastructure, the new Ireland, cultural heritage and drink!' that featured BBC Northern Ireland broadcaster Joe Lindsay. Bill's hilarious; close-to-the-knuckle commentary sees him in another light, as his polished intonation and wisecracks make it entertaining. Formerly a resident of Rosstulla Avenue in Newtownabbey's Jordanstown area, Bill died of cancer on 26 January 2011 in Belfast City Hospital. He was buried alongside his late parents at Movilla Cemetery in Newtownards, Co. Down. He is survived by daughters Gillian, Elaine, Emma and Adele, and six grandchildren. Bill Smyth will forever be remembered for his tone of voice and his brilliant ability to employ it in whatever was required for that moment. It was indeed unique ‚Äì instantly recognisable, no-nonsense and authoritative. To his contemporaries and younger generations who knew him, he will be regarded as having been quintessentially a class act and legend within the sphere of Northern Irish broadcasting.

It is also known as Lithia Springs Comprehensive High School. It was the second high school to open in the Douglas County School District.  History  Until December 2, 1975, Douglas County had only one high school, Douglas County High School, which opened in the late 1930s. By 1974 the secondary school population had grown to over 3,000 students, far too many for the existing buildings of DCHS to accommodate in a regular school day. Beginning in August 1974, the county had to resort to double sessions. This meant that those students designated to attend Lithia Springs High School would attend the afternoon session, starting at about 11:00 and going until about 5:30. Construction and weather problems delayed the opening of LSHS until December 1975.  STEM Magnet Program  Lithia Springs High School is home to Douglas County's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Magnet program. Use of Project Lead the Way's (PLTW) specialized curriculum in Biomedical Science, Computer Science, and Engineering distinguishes the STEM Magnet program from all other STEM pathways offered in DCSS. Three separate agencies, each with its own rigorous and comprehensive certification process, have recognized the quality and value of the LSHS STEM program: the Georgia Department of Education (2016), Cognia Accreditation, formally AdvancED (2017), and the National Institute for STEM Education (2019). With personalized learning opportunities, STEM students are empowered to work collaboratively on complex, open-ended tasks. Through an inquiry-based approach for building knowledge and blended learning experiences, instructors develop a more inclusive, interactive and creative approach to teaching. As a result, students develop self confidence, independence, and pride in their accomplishments as they use newly-acquired content knowledge to explore, design, test, modify, and solve problems which exist in the real world. Graduates of the STEM program satisfy a diverse array of rigorous expectations, including AP and Dual Enrollment courses, to develop a comprehensive portfolio and r√©sum√© for their post-secondary endeavors.https://www.lshsstem.comhttps://www.dcssga.org/about/schools/high  Demographics  * teachers: 86.1 (FTE) Students by grade: *Grade 9: 488 *Grade 10: 433 *Grade 11: 347 *Grade 12: 299 Notable alumni * Walton Goggins, actor, best known for his roles on the FX Networks series The Shield and Justified * Elana Meyers, Olympic bobsledding bronze medalist in 2010, silver medalist in 2014, and silver medalist in 2018 * Calvin Pace, outside linebacker, New York Jets #97 * Lil Nas X, rapper * 1NASAAN, rapper * Josh Scogin, rock musician References External links * Lithia Springs High School * Public School Review Category:Public high schools in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Schools in Douglas County, Georgia Category:Educational institutions established in 1975 Category:1975 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Lithia Springs High School"},{"id":"30641112","text":"Paavali Halonen was a farmer and settler in Finnish Lapland and a fabled warlord during the Russo-Swedish War (1590‚Äì1595). The king of Sweden Gustav I promoted Finnish settlement beyond the Russian border of the realm by promising taxation reliefs to the settlers. This was in order for the king to be able to have claims for the region. The Russian border was by then defined by the Treaty of N√∂teborg. This pursuit caused tensions with Russia, and during the Russo-Swedish War, Finnish settlements in northern Ostrobothnia were often destroyed by East Karelian guerrillas. The life of Paavali Halonen belongs to this time. He has been a historical person, although most of the knowledge about him is only folklore. \\"Halonen\\" is a Savonian surname and Paavali Halonen was the first permanent and Finnish settler inhabitant of Kemij√§rvi. Local folklore has preserved stories about Paavali Halonen as one of the guerrilla chiefs, the most famous of them being Pekka Vesainen. Halonen was born in Muhos and led a vengeance raid to Kola and Kandalaksha and took part in attempt to capture fort of Kola with other Finnish chiefs, Vilmi and Kauppi from Kemi. East Karelians (Russians) offered peace and invited Finnish chiefs to the town for drinking. They were captured by Russians, but Paavali Halonen was suspicious and refused the offer. Thus he saved his life and returned home. According to the stories he first discovered Kemij√§rvi while escaping from Russia through the wilderness. Later he moved there with his family. As the first settlers moved to Kemij√§rvi, the area was not inhabited by the Sami people anymore. The first tax record (maakirja) including Kemij√§rvi village is from 1631. Then the householder of the Halonen's farm was Paavo Paavonpoika (Paavo's son) Halonen, who probably was the son of the first inhabitant. His place of residence is known today as Halosenniemi. Large part of the population in North East Lapland today can trace their ancestry back to the sons of Paavali Halonen.

This assessment may be an exploration of the model's underlying statistical assumptions, an examination of the structure of the model by considering formulations that have fewer, more or different explanatory variables, or a study of subgroups of observations, looking for those that are either poorly represented by the model (outliers) or that have a relatively large effect on the regression model's predictions. A regression diagnostic may take the form of a graphical result, informal quantitative results or a formal statistical hypothesis test, each of which provides guidance for further stages of a regression analysis.

It is located west-southwest of Red Bluff, California. It was closed in 1970. History Red Bluff Air Force Station was initially part of Phase II of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. The Air Force approved this expansion of the Mobile Radar program on October 23, 1952. Radars in this network were designated ‚ÄúSM.‚Äù The station consisted of 30.84 acres, was acquired by the Air Force on May 25, 1955. The station became operational on 1 April 1956 when the 859th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to the new station. Initially Red Bluff used AN/MPS-8 and AN/MPS-11 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The AN/MPS-11 remained until 1963. In 1959 the Air Force placed AN/FPS-6 and -6A height- finder radars and removed the AN/MPS-8 from Red Bluff. During 1960 Red Bluff AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, feeding data to DC-13 at Adair AFS, Oregon. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 859th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-157. In 1964 Red Bluff became a joint-use facility with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), using the AN/FPS-67 search and AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars located on site. In addition to the main facility, Red Bluff operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Janesville, CA (SM-157A) * Whitmore, CA (SM-157B) * Hayfork, CA (SM-157C) The 859th was inactivated 30 September 1970 and the station was closed due to budget restraints. 8.1 acres were turned over to the FAA on November 15, 1971, and 22.615 acres, currently known as Ridgeway County Park, were turned over to the Tehema County for use as a public park on August 2, 1972. The 4.24-acre Red Bluff Housing Annex included 16 family housing units, located within the city of Red Bluff in Tahema County. It was declared excess and turned over to GSA on December 10, 1970. In 1972, GSA quitclaimed portions of the 4.24 acres to 17 grantees, and the remaining 0.03 acres turned over to the City of Red Bluff by the Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare. A 1991 Family Housing Area report stated that the original housing area, currently divided among 14 owners as 17 single- family homes, were all occupied. The majority of the site (excluding Family Housing) is known as Ridgeway County Park, with the remainder used by the FAA as a weather station. Many of the original structures have been removed. Structures present and still in use at the time of a 1991 USACE site investigation include the operations building, rec hall, pump house and well, and sewage treatment facility. Structures still present but not used since DOD occupation include a swamp cooler for the rec hall, the sewage treatment plant chlorinator, and the sewage treatment pump house.

After taking office, he instituted uniform admission standards for all students. During his tenure, he oversaw the expansion of the faculty, curriculum changes, and the construction of five new buildings. He left office to become chancellor of the Colleges of William & Mary (1960‚Äì1962), until the General Assembly of Virginia made those five public colleges independent. Then he was chancellor of the college (1962‚Äì1974). The faculty were unhappy with President Chandler when state law required that they subscribe to loyalty oaths. A star professor decamped for McGill University, and faculty recruiting suffered. Students chafed at censorship of their publications, restrictions on drinking, and requirements for chaperones. Death On the 26 May 1987, Alvin died in the Virginia Beach General Hospital, age 84.

He was responsible for the Massacre of Kalavryta, in Greece. Life and career Karl von Le Suire was born on 8 November 1898 in Unterw√∂ssen in Upper Bavaria. After entering the German Army in December 1916, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Bavarian infantry and served on the Western Front. He continued in the army after 1918. Von Le Suire held a number of staff appointments in the early part of World War II, including Chief of Staff of Gebirgs Corps Norway. He was then given command of the 99th Gebirgsjager Regiment. This was followed by command of the 46th Infantry Division in February 1943 and the Balkans-based 117th J√§ger Division in May 1943. In November 1943, while commanded by von Le Suire, the 117th J√§ger Division began a mission named Unternehmen Kalavryta (Operation Kalavryta), intending to encircle Greek guerrilla fighters in the mountainous area surrounding Kalavryta. During the operations, some German soldiers were killed and 77 of them, who were taken prisoners, were executed by the Greek guerrillas. On 10 December 1943 von Le Suire signed the order for the German division to \\"level the locations Mazeika and Kalavryta\\". In total, more than 1,200 civilians were killed during the reprisal operations. About 1,000 houses were looted and burned and more than 2,000 sheep and other large domestic animals were seized by the Germans. The event is known as the Massacre of Kalavryta. From August 1944 von Le Suire commanded the XXXXIX Mountain Corps, and was still in command when he surrendered to Soviet troops in May 1945. He died in Soviet captivity on 18 June 1954 in a prisoner of war camp at Stalingrad.

Plot The story takes place in the aftermath of the disputed Iran's 2009 elections.About Zahra's ParadiseA thousand words. An online cartoon enthralls not just the Iranian diaspora, The Economist, May 20th 2010 It recounts a search for Mehdi, a young activist who has vanished in their aftermath, likely abducted by the government's secret police. The search is carried out by his mother (the titular Zahra), his brother (a blogger), and their friends. \\"Zahra's Paradise\\" is also the English name of Behesht-e Zahra, the largest cemetery in Iran, located in Tehran. The comic's title purposefully draws inspiration from that place, a place of rest for many Iranians from all paths of life, including both the supporters and opponents of the Iranian revolution and the current Iranian government. The novel's characters echo real figures, such as Mohsen Rouholamini, a 25-year-old who was reported to have died of prison abuse in 2009, and Sohrab Aarabi, the 19-year-old who was gunned down in the protests, both of whom, like Neda Agha-Soltan, were buried in Behesht-e Zahra. It's also reminiscent of the story of Hossein Derakhshan, the Iranian- Canadian who helped spark the Iranian blogging movement, before voluntarily returning to his homeland in 2008, only to be imprisoned indefinitely. Another name of relevance is that of the Canadian-Iranian journalist Zahra Kazemi, known for her investigations into missing people in Iran, who was beaten to death in an Iranian prison in 2003.Terror, Black on White, Der Spiegel, June 6, 2010 Reception Zahra's Paradise has received a wide and positive reception; a review in The Independent noted that \\"the webcomic is garnering enthusiastic mentions across the mainstream media and ... varied blogs.\\" Its themes and style have been compared to that of Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, a graphic novel that was adapted into an animated film, was a recipient of numerous awards, and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2007.

Early life He attended the College of William & Mary from the ages of 10 through 14, when his education was cut short by the death of his father in 1842, causing him to leave the College and move to Richmond, Virginia. There he entered the law office of his brother William G. Sands, who was the clerk of the Superior Court of Law and Chancery in the City of Richmond. He read the law under the tutelage of his brother and Superior Court Judge Robertson and procured his license to practice law on April 13, 1849, at the age of twenty-one. Sands eventually became one of the foremost lawyers in the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly in the intricacies of chancery practice. Legal career On April 13, 1849, Sands procured his license, and henceforth to the time of his death was an honored member of the legal profession; a profession which he described in his book, ‚ÄúRecreations of a Southern Barrister,‚Äù as one of the noblest. As an advocate, he was laborious fluent and convincing always ready as an extempore speaker yet excelling most when his thoughts had been first written or printed. Sands and John Howard shared a practice known as Howard & Sands. This founding law practice eventually became the law firm of Sands Anderson PC. Religious career Just before the American Civil War Mr. Sands was ordained as a Baptist minister, and he established churches in Ashland and Glen Allen for African Americans and served as their pastor. For the rest of his life he preached on Sundays and practiced law during the week. Mr. Sands was a delegate to the Virginia Secession Convention (held in 1861). In the early 1880s, Mr. Sands practiced law with his son Conway in a firm known as Sands & Sands, and he continued the practice of law up until shortly before his death on December 22, 1887. Literary career Alexander Sands was a prolific writer. For several years he edited the Evening Bulletin, a paper published in the City of Richmond, and during the absence of Jno. R. Thompson in Europe, he edited the Southern Literary Messenger. He was also editor of the Quarterly Law Review, published in Richmond, and contributed articles to the Methodist Quarterly Review, the Christian Review, the Religious Herald, and many other religious papers. In addition to these published works, he authored the following books: ‚ÄúHistory of a Suit in Equity‚Äù (1854 and 1882); ‚ÄúRecreations of a Southern Barrister‚Äù (1860); ‚ÄúAlexander Tate's American Form Book‚Äù (1857); ‚ÄúPractical Law Forms‚Äù (1872); ‚ÄúHubbell's Legal Directory of Virginia Laws‚Äù; ‚ÄúSermons by a Village Pastor‚Äù; and ‚ÄúA Constitutional History of Virginia‚Äù (not printed).

The theme encompassed parts of Central Greece, Thessaly and, until , the Peloponnese peninsula. It was established in the late 7th century, and survived until the late 11th/12th century, when it was broken up into smaller districts. History =7th‚Äì8th centuries= The ancient term \\"Hellas\\" was already in use in the 6th century to designate southern Greece in an administrative context, being employed in the Synekdemos as an alternative name for the Roman province of Achaea. During the late 6th and early 7th centuries, the final collapse of the Byzantine Empire's Danube frontier allowed large-scale Slavic invasions and settlements to occur all over the Balkan peninsula. From 578, Slavic raids reached Thessaly and southern Greece. Aided by the Byzantine Empire's preoccupation with the long and bloody wars with Sassanid Persia in the east, and with the Avar Khaganate in the north, the Slavs raided and settled almost at will. The Slavic settlement that followed the raids in the late 6th and early 7th centuries affected the Peloponnese in the south and Macedonia in the north far more than Thessaly or Central Greece, with the fortified towns largely remaining in the hands of the native Greek population. Nevertheless, in the first decades of the 7th century the Slavs were free to raid Thessaly and the south relatively unhindered; according to the Miracles of Saint Demetrius, in the Slavic tribes even built monoxyla and raided the coasts of Thessaly and many Aegean islands, depopulating many of them. Some of the native Greeks fled to the fortified cities, to off-shore islands, or to Italy. The creation of the theme of Hellas is dated to sometime between 687 and 695, during the first reign of Emperor Justinian II (),. probably as a direct result of his 688/689 campaign against the Slavs. The first strategos (military governor) of Hellas is attested in 695: Leontios, formerly strategos of the Anatolic Theme, who had fallen into disgrace following his defeat at the Battle of Sebastopolis, and who thereupon rebelled against Justinian and overthrew him. Although the contemporary sources do not apply the term \\"theme\\" to Hellas until after the 8th century, using the term strategia (œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥ŒØŒ±, \\"generalcy\\") instead, it is almost certain that it was established from the outset as a full administrative entity, controlling those lands of the old province of Achaea that still remained under imperial control. The original extent of the theme is unclear and debated, but based on the (assumed) extent of Byzantine control, its territory must have comprised the eastern coast of the mainland (eastern Central Greece with Euboea and parts of Thessaly), possibly including the eastern Peloponnese, as well as some Aegean islands like Skyros and Kea.. It is unclear whether Athens or Thebes was the province's original capital; most likely Thebes, as it certainly filled this role in the early 10th century. In the second half of the 10th century, however, the strategos seat was transferred to Larissa. Given its lack of depth in the hinterland, the theme was originally probably oriented mostly towards the sea and comprised the coastal areas that the Byzantine navy was able to control. It was not until the reign of Leo III the Isaurian () that major land operations are recorded, and not until the early 9th century that the re-establishment of imperial control in the hinterland was completed. Thus Justinian II settled several thousand Mardaites in Hellas, who provided garrisons and crews for local naval squadrons. The number of land troops on the other hand remained rather low throughout the theme's existence, numbering perhaps 2,000, according to the estimates of Warren Treadgold. The fleet of Hellas played a prominent role during the anti-iconoclast revolt of 726/7. During the course of the 8th century, however, imperial authority was gradually extended to the interior. The local Slavic inhabitants were Christianized and subjected to Byzantine authority, often in autonomous districts under their own archontes. This process was interrupted, but not halted, by another wave of Slavic settlement in from Bulgaria; imperial possessions appear not to have been greatly affected, and the fact that in 766, Emperor Constantine V () was able to call upon 500 artisans from \\"Hellas and the islands\\" to Constantinople suggests a secured and regular contact between the province and the imperial centre. The anti-Slavic expedition of the minister Staurakios in 783 restored and extended imperial control once again, especially in the Peloponnese and northern Greece. In Central Greece and Thessaly, the campaign seems to have been mostly a show of force to strengthen imperial rule and subdue the new settlers, while in the Peloponnese it probably involved actual fighting against the Slavs. Although the local Slavs of the Peloponnese were not fully subdued at this time, the gradual strengthening of imperial authority eventually led to the splitting off of the Peloponnese to form a separate theme around or soon after the year 800. =9th‚Äì12th centuries= During the 9th and early 10th centuries, Hellas suffered from Saracen raids, especially after the conquest of Crete by the Arabs in the 820s and the establishment of the Emirate of Crete. Among the major such events, in the 880s the Arab emir of Tarsus attacked Euripos (Chalcis) but was defeated, and in 902 the Saracens under the renegade Damian of Tarsus sacked the port city of Demetrias. Ten ships from Hellas also participated in the failed attempt to recover Crete under Himerios in 911/2. In 918 and again in 923, the area was subjected to Bulgarian raids under Tsar Simeon that reached even into the Peloponnese and may have destroyed Thebes. Nevertheless, from the late 9th century on Hellas, along with the rest of Greece, shows evidence of increased prosperity, such as the increase in coinage, foundation of new towns and the establishment of new industries (most notably the silk industry in Thebes). The Saracen threat receded during the 10th century and was practically ended as the result of the Byzantine reconquest of Crete in 960‚Äì961, but the Bulgarian threat was renewed under Tsar Samuel, who occupied Thessaly in 986 and launched several devastating raids into Central Greece and the Peloponnese until his defeat at the Battle of Spercheios in 997. During the 10th and 11th centuries, Hellas was often governed jointly with the Peloponnese under a single strategos, and as the civilian administration rose in importance, the same practice appears there as well, with protonotarioi, praetores and kritai being appointed for both themes. Thessaly appears to have been detached from Hellas and joined to the theme of Thessalonica from the early 11th century‚Äîthough the Spercheios valley remained part of Hellas‚Äîuntil sometime in the 12th century. The strategos of Hellas is still attested for much of the 11th century, and a doux of Thebes and Euripus after the middle of the 12th century. By the end of the 11th century, the joint administration of Hellas and the Peloponnese came under the control of the megas doux, the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy. Due to the latter's absence from the province, however, the local administration remained under the local praetor, a position often held during this period by senior and distinguished officials like the legal scholars Alexios Aristenos and Nicholas Hagiotheodorites. Increasingly, however, smaller jurisdictions appeared within the boundaries of both themes. These eventually evolved into the smaller fiscal districts variously termed horia (sing. horion), chartoularata (sing. chartoularaton), and episkepseis (sing. episkepsis) in the 12th century, while the old themes of Hellas and the Peloponnese gradually withered away as administrative entities. The horia in particular are only attested for Greece, and appear to have been based at Larissa, Thebes and Euripus, Athens, Corinth, and Patras. The 11th century was largely a period of peace for southern Greece, interrupted only by raids during the uprising of Petar Delyan (1040‚Äì1041), a raid by the Turkic Uzes tribe in 1064, and the unsuccessful Norman attacks into Thessaly in 1082‚Äì1083. The Italian maritime republics, with the Republic of Venice first and foremost, began to establish their presence in the region towards the end of the century, signalling the beginning of the Italians' ascendancy in maritime commerce and their gradual takeover of the Byzantine economy: in the aftermath of the failed Norman invasion, Alexios I granted the first trading privileges to the Venetians in exchange for their naval aids against Norman fleets, such as immunity from taxation and the right to set up trade colonies in certain towns including Constantinople itself; In Hellas, Euripus, Thebes, and Athens were among those towns. Alexios' successors tried to curb these privileges with successes in part ‚Äî and leading to the Venetian sacking of Euripus in 1171 as a retaliation - but in 1198 Alexios III Angelos () was forced to concede even more extensive ones, allowing the Venetians to create trade stations virtually in all cities situated close to the coast. In 1148, the Normans under Roger II of Sicily plundered Thebes, carrying off its silk workers to Palermo. The local silk industry survived, however, and was revived, partly if not mostly with Jewish workers as attested by Benjamin of Tudela in his visit in 1165. Both Benjamin and the Arab geographer al-Idrisi describe Greece during the middle of the 12th century as densely populated and prosperous, while Benjamin records the presence of Jewish communities in Thebes, Krisa, Euripus, Ravenica, and Zetouni (Lamia). The situation began to change towards the end of the reign of Manuel I Komnenos (), whose costly military ventures led to a hike in taxation. Coupled with the corruption and autocratic behaviour of officials, this led to a decline in industry and the impoverishment of the peasantry, eloquently lamented by the Metropolitan of Athens, Michael Choniates. This decline was temporarily halted under Andronikos I Komnenos (), who sent the capable Nikephoros Prosouch as praetor, but resumed after Andronikos' fall. At the turn the 13th century, the centrifugal tendencies in the Byzantine state became more and more pronounced. In the northwestern Peloponnese, Leo Sgouros, ruler of Nauplia, had already taken over Argos and Corinth, and launched raids into Attica. Taking advantage of the preoccupation of the imperial authorities with the Fourth Crusade, in 1204 he captured Athens, before taking over Boeotia and Thessaly without a fight. Having become the master of a quasi-independent realm encompassing much of eastern mainland Greece, he then tried to legitimize his position by marrying the daughter of the deposed Alexios III Angelos at Larissa. Following the sack of Constantinople by the Crusaders in April 1204, however, the situation changed: in the same autumn, Boniface of Montferrat led a crusader army into Greece. Leo Sgouros tried to confront the Crusaders at the Thermopylae, but his soldiers ran away, and he retreated to his fortress bases in the Peloponnese, from where he resisted for a few more years. Boniface divided the captured lands among his followers; the main Latin states formed in the former area of Hellas were the Duchy of Athens, the Marquisate of Bodonitsa, the Lordship of Salona, and the Triarchy of Negroponte.

Grossman about conflict and controversy among stakeholders on the Internet. It was published by NYU Press in 1997, and was simultaneously made available free as an online version. The book discusses conflicts which arose during the growth of the Internet from 1993 through 1997, labeled by Grossman as \\"boundary disputes\\". These disputes deal with issues including privacy, encryption, copyright, censorship, sex, and pornography. The author discusses history of organizations in their attempts to enforce their intellectual property on the Internet, against individuals who attempted to reveal confidential materials asserting it was in the public interest. Grossman frames these disputes with respect to overarching rights of freedom of speech and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book received a positive reception, and was described by Technology Review as \\"one of the first comprehensive reports on the upheavals underway in cyberspace.\\" Publishers Weekly praised the depth of discussion in the book, and Library Journal commented positively on the history and background imparted. New Scientist gave the book a favorable review, commenting, \\"Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative book about the complexity and challenges of the Net.\\" Reason magazine observed, \\"Grossman has written an intriguing account of the Internet's partial fulfillment of its seemingly limitless promise.\\" Publication history Wendy M. Grossman (1997) Prior to the book's publication, the author was recognized in 1996 with an award from the American Society of Journalists and Authors for an article in Wired magazine about conflict on the Internet. Net.wars was published in book format by NYU Press in 1997, in addition to an edition in a computer file format. NYU Press made the text of the book available for free via its website. Contents The book discusses the changes online citizens saw take place on the Internet during the period in the intervening years between 1993 and 1997. Grossman labels the conflict which took place during this time as \\"boundary disputes\\". These \\"boundary disputes\\" included issues involving privacy, encryption, copyright, censorship, sex, and pornography. She describes these conflicts as taking place, \\"along the border between cyberspace and real life\\". Grossman attributes this conflict to \\"the Net's convulsions over the years 1993 to 1996, as it tried to assimilate huge numbers of new users who didn't share the culture that had been developing over the previous decade\\". The author acknowledges that she is a \\"Netizen\\", and questions her own objective stance due to this involvement. Grossman informs the reader that she appreciates \\"the fact that in this age of polite political correctness there is a place in the world where people feel free to speak their minds, even offensively\\". She gives an analogy for the reader regarding those who would discuss and comment on the phenomenon of the Internet-based community without prior experience: \\"Journalists who don't use the Net themselves routinely make such egregious technological and cultural errors that you can only compare the results to what would happen if they were assigned to write about the interstate highway system based on their experiences at sea.... [I]f the police told you that prostitutes routinely and openly solicited truckers and other visitors to roadside rest areas and that therefore they were risky places for families to visit, you would probably believe them and write the story.... At the same time, after a while it's easy to lose perspective and forget that behavior which is common and tolerated on the Net seems shocking to newcomers.\\" The author states her desire for the Internet to remain an open community, \\"I would like to see the freedom of the old net.culture survive in the face of the many competing commercial and regulatory interests that might prefer to limit its reach and openness.\\" The book delves into specific examples of organizations which attempted to enforce their perceived intellectual property from being distributed to websites on the Internet, as balanced against the ability of people participating in an online community to bring previously confidential material to light whilst stating it serves the public interest to do so. She recounts activism by Internet users against the Communications Decency Act, which was ultimately deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States. Grossman includes a discussion of participation in online discussion on the Internet with respect to the rights of freedom of speech and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Reception Writing for the Technology Review of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Wade Roush called the book, \\"one of the first comprehensive reports on the upheavals underway in cyberspace.\\" Roush commented on the author's writing style, \\"Grossman writes plainly yet entertainingly, providing a pleasant antidote to the breathless rhetoric one finds in many books and magazines devoted to computer culture.\\" The review concluded, \\"But what ties the book together is Grossman's demonstration that the boundary disputes have more to do with power than with decency or etiquette. The Net gives all its users a vastly increased power to communicate. How much of this power, she asks, will average users be allowed to keep?\\" Donna Seaman of Booklist wrote that Grossman, \\"vividly describes the virtual realm as a place of interconnecting communities every bit as complicated, exciting, and dangerous as any city.\\" Seaman concluded, \\"As Grossman relates Net lore and history, she traces its transformation from a textual, academic medium into a graphics- heavy promotional bonanza, a development that has caused the online population to double over the past three years to nearly 60 million users.\\" In a review for Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries, C. Koch characterized the work, \\"This book is in the form of a series of explorations of various instances of such problems and how they can be seen to relate to matters of undesirable curtailment of free speech and to the more positive potential of the Net to foster new Net communities.\\" Koch wrote of the author's writing style, \\"The book is a bit rambling in style, but those committed to the value of open Net community may find it pleasantly reflective.\\" Publishers Weekly reviewed the book and recommended it for multiple types of readers, \\"Both newbies (newcomers to the Internet) and Netizens (old-timers) will find challenges and rewards in this witty, knowledgeable and timely report from the electronic front.\\" Publishers Weekly wrote positively of the amount of detail included in the book's discussion, \\"Journalist Grossman covers in considerable depth the battles now raging over the First Amendment rights, security, privacy and general standards of conduct in cyberspace.\\" Library Journal wrote of the success of the author's argumentation, \\"Grossman sets out to answer questions about the future of the Internet and how it will be regulated. She does a fine job of explaining the issues and the background behind online controversies\\". Library Journal commented on Grossman's viewpoint, \\"Her approach is one of informed skepticism\\". Harold Thimbleby of New Scientist gave the book a positive review, writing, \\"Here at last is a sensible, thought-provoking and informative book about the complexity and challenges of the Net.\\" He compared Grossman's writing to other works on the subject matter, \\"Most books are too enthusiastic about the technology, too American, too Utopian, too get-rich-quick‚Äîor just out of date. In Net.wars we have a good, profoundly challenging book, which rises above parochialism. It is full of insights‚Äîas much into bulletin boards as sexual stereotyping, rights to free speech and establishing global copyright.\\" Thimbleby concluded, \\"Everyone, particularly police, lawyers, teachers, parents and scientists, can usefully read this book and consider what the Net really means for us all.\\" In a review for Reason, Nick Gillespie described the book as, \\"a nuanced map to the latest 'place' to inspire grand utopian thinking: the Internet, that ethereal and increasingly important worldwide network of computer networks.\\" Gillespie wrote positively of the author's breadth of knowledge and experience about the subject matter, \\"An American journalist living in London, Grossman brings a wealth of professional and personal experience to the material‚Äîand a clarity of style and analysis that is a welcome relief from both the hyperbolic prose of many Net boosters and the overwrought jeremiads of cyberphobes.\\" His review concluded, \\"the great virtue of net.wars is its recognition that cyberspace's utopian potential‚Äîits ability to enrich existing real communities while creating new, virtual ones‚Äîis directly tied to its ability to change, grow, and make itself useful to its inhabitants. In showing how that process works in both historical and cultural terms, Grossman has written an intriguing account of the Internet's partial fulfillment of its seemingly limitless promise.\\" The Village Voice pointed out the decision of publisher NYU Press to publish the book's contents online, noting, \\"Risking profits for the sake of progress, NYU Press has decided to publish journalist Wendy Grossman's canny new book, net.wars, simultaneously in print and in a free online version ... For NYU, it's a big gamble for publicity.\\" The review observed that the nature of the book's format was appropriate for online distribution, \\"the online design of net.wars points to an even more dramatic literary evolution. Net.wars, with over 500 hypertext links, is truly more Web site than book, and it unquestionably belongs online.\\" In its review of her book, Kirkus Reviews pointed out a paradox regarding one of Grossman's proposed solutions to issues of encroachment upon Internet freedoms. Kirkus Reviews noted, \\"Unfortunately, the solutions that Grossman suggests, while more politically moderate than those suggested by others, seem to subvert the true purpose of the Internet. She suggests smaller, more manageable virtual communities, whereas the Internet, in theory, is supposed to link all corners of the world.\\" The review concluded, \\"At least Grossman is offering solutions, however, which is what distinguishes net.wars from most contribution on this seemingly inexhaustible topic.\\" See also * Censorship * Censorship in the United States * Free content * Freedom of speech by country * Freedom of speech in the United States * Freedom of the press * International Freedom of Expression Exchange * WikiLeaks References Further reading Book reviews * Related   External links * Net.wars, full text of book, at NYU Press * PelicanCrossing.net, website of author Category:1997 non-fiction books Category:Books about the Internet Category:Works about computer law Category:Cyberspace Category:Books about freedom of speech Category:Texts related to the history of the Internet Category:New York University Press books ","title":"Net.wars"},{"id":"30641395","text":"WANR may refer to: * WANR (FM), a radio station (88.5 FM) licensed to serve Brewster, New York, United States * WHTX (AM), a radio station (1570 AM) licensed to serve Warren, Ohio, United States, which held the call sign WANR from 1990 to 2011 ","title":"WANR"},{"id":"30641432","text":"Grand Hotel Kathmandu is a hotel in Kathmandu, Nepal, located on Red Cross Road in Tachachal, in the western central part of the city, near Kathmandu Engineering College.

He was apparently killed in battle c. 533, but an impostor claimed his identity c. 545-546. The only source for both men is Procopius.  Origin  According to some scholars Chilbudius was probably a Slav, although Florin Curta argues this view was misled by the story of the Antian namesake who claimed his identity.Curta (2001), p. 76 The name has also been considered to be Germanic origin.Amory, p.484 : \\"Other Byzantine officers active in the Balkans and bearing Germanic names included Baduarius dux Scythiae, Ascum MVM per Illyricum ... and Chilbudius MVM per Thracias\\" Bohdan Strumins'kyj suggested a Gothic name, *Hil(i)baudeis / *Hil(i)b≈´deis, a name attested in Old High German as Hillibodo, rather than the traditional Slavic etymology of *xvalibud (\\"awakener of glory\\").Strumins'kyj (1979-1980), p. 790-791 This demonstrates the difficulty in etymologizing proper names.Alexander Schenker. The Dawn of Slavic. Pg 5 \\"whilst the etymology of a common noun can be attested at the semantic level, most proper names do not lend themselves to such verification.  Biography  Chilbudius served as a member of the household of emperor Justinian I (r. 527-565). Procopius introduces him as a vigorous soldier and commends him for his lack of avarice. He claims that Chilbudius was not seeking to amass wealth for himself. Chilbudius was appointed magister militum per Thracias \\"in the fourth year\\" of Justinian' reign (530/531). He was the direct successor of Germanus in that post. He was tasked with defending the Danube limes against barbarian incursions. He served for three years (c. 533/534), eventually moving his forces to the north of the Danube. In this manner, Chilbudius prevented invasions in Byzantine territories while taking the battle to hostile territory. He was reportedly killed in battle with Slavs (South Slavs) at the end of this period. In 545/546, one of the Antae, held captive by the Sclaveni, claimed to be Chilbudius. With the Antae and the Sclaveni temporarily at peace with each other, the Chilbudius impostor passed to the hands of another member of the Antae. A Byzantine captive held by the same man persuaded their master that his fellow slave was the real Chilbudius. He also tried to convince said master to return the captive to Justinian, which would require a journey through Byzantine areas. When among the other Antae, the impostor revealed his actual identity and tried to claim the status of a freedman. His tribesmen found him more useful as Chilbudius than as one of them. He was pressured to continue the pretense.Curta (2001), p. 79-81 At about this time, Justinian started negotiations with the Antae. He offered to them the ancient city of Turris, \\"to the north of the river Ister\\" (the Danube), and its vicinity. The city had been reportedly built by Trajan (r. 98-117) but lay deserted at the time. The Antae would be allowed to settle in this area and receive payment for guarding the Byzantine borders against the Huns, effectively gaining foederati status. The Antae accepted, but on the condition that \\"Chilbudius\\" would be restored to office, attempting to raise their man to the rank of magister militum. The plot was reportedly unveiled by Narses, who captured the Chilbudius impostor and transported him to Constantinople. His subsequent fate is unknown. Whatever his real identity, the impostor reportedly spoke Latin fluently.  Interpretation  The relevant narrative of Procopius has been compared to the typical plots of the Ancient Greek comedy (New Comedy in particular) and/or Plautus. Florin Curta argues that Procopius' tale should not be taken at face value. The story probably has a historic basis, but Procopius \\"surely reworked the account and arranged it according to comic narrative patterns\\". Curta suggests that the Antae might have understood \\"Chilbudius\\" as a title, rather than a name, and thus named a Chilbudius of their own. The activities of Narses do not seem to have disrupted the alliance. A number of Antae seem to have joined the Byzantines in the ongoing Gothic War (535-554), and are recorded fighting against the Ostrogoths in Lucania.

Early life Alex Wright was born at his mother's family home in Elmfoot Street, Oatlands. His parents married in 1929 at St Francis RC Church in Hutchesontown, Glasgow, and he was an only child. By the time he started school his parents had moved to McLean Street, Kinning Park, and his father was beginning to exhibit symptoms of multiple sclerosis. Wright was initially enrolled in the elementary class at the closest school to his home, Lorne Street School, but after five months transferred to Kinning Park's RC primary school, Our Lady and St Margaret's in Stanley Street. His father's health continued to deteriorate and circumstances dictated that Wright attend the nearest secondary school to his home; Lambhill Street School, Kinning Park. Wright himself was hospitalised with tuberculosis before leaving school at 14 and entering an apprenticeship as optical engineer. Until the age of 17, he played juvenile football with highly regarded Avon Villa at the Plantation pitches. Before agreeing to join Partick Thistle, Wright had previously rejected interest from Arsenal due to his father's failing health. Playing career =Partick Thistle= Provisionally signed by Partick Thistle at 17 and 'farmed out' to Ayrshire Junior side Dalry Thistle for season 1948‚Äì49, Wright played only 11 games for Dalry before being 'called up'.Robert Reid et al, Partick Thistle Football Club 1876‚Äì2002 The Official History, 2002Robert Reid, Red & Yellow Forever, 1996Kennedy & Hosie, Partick Thistle Legends, 2007 Expecting to play for Dalry the next day, Wright was summoned to Firhill on the evening of Friday 28 January 1949. Thistle's new manager David Meiklejohn asked him to sign professional forms and told Wright he would make his senior debut the following day. It was exactly seven weeks after his 18th birthday and he was fielded wearing the attacking number 8 shirt (inside-right) in front of a reported 60,000 fans in the Glasgow derby against Rangers at Ibrox Park. The game finished in a 2‚Äì2 draw, and Wright played in 7 of Thistle's remaining 10 league matches plus a home Scottish Cup tie against Queen of the South. He scored his first goal against Dundee in October 1949 but thereafter experienced his first prolonged absence as his father finally died from the effects of multiple sclerosis in December 1949, aged only 41. Wright returned to the Thistle side in February 1950 and played in every game to the end of the season. Wright performed for Partick Thistle most of his playing career, being selected in four of the five forward positions (numbers 7 to 10), before converting to a more defensively minded wing-half position (numbers 4 and 6) later in his career. He even donned the goalkeeper's jersey on more than one occasion as an emergency measure during an era when injury substitutions were not yet permitted. His total statistics in all matches for Partick are given as 351 appearances and 85 goals. His appearances were restricted during seasons 1950‚Äì51, 1951‚Äì52 and 1952‚Äì53 as he fulfilled his National Service with the Royal Scots in Germany. Despite this, and still no older than 21, he was flown home by Partick Thistle to play in important matches during this period. He was promoted to lance-corporal in the army and was captain of the British Army of the Rhine's select football team which also included future Scotland international goalkeeper Tommy Younger. National Service completed, Wright began 1953‚Äì54 as a first-team regular at Firhill and played 45 games in all competitions that season, scoring 24 goals. He appeared in the Scottish League Cup Finals of 1953, 1956 and 1958, each of which ended in defeat, and in 1959 captained the Glasgow Select to a 5‚Äì1 victory in its annual challenge match against the Sheffield Select. Partick Thistle was one of the Scottish clubs to take part in an unofficial midweek 'British Floodlit League' over seasons 1955‚Äì56 and 1956‚Äì57; the fixtures were not all completed but Wright featured in the six matches played against Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a 25-yard blockbuster in a 2‚Äì0 victory against Spurs at Firhill in November 1956 and being named man-of-the match. He also scored twice in an away friendly against Derby County in December 1953. His leadership qualities were recognised by being appointed Thistle's captain for several seasons at a time when there were Scotland internationalists in the team. During his final season at Partick Thistle he played exclusively in the reserve side as a senior player / mentor. Seeing he was no longer part of the first-team plans at Firhill, Glasgow rivals Clyde bid ¬£8000 for his services - Partick rejected this offer before later accepting East Fife's ¬£4000 payment for his transfer in May 1963. =East Fife= Wright subsequently played as an almost ever-present during season 1963‚Äì64 in the Second Division, for East Fife under manager Jimmy Bonthrone, playing 41 league and cup matches and scoring 5 goals from his driving mid- field position. He was made captain by manager Bonthrone and led the Fifers to a League Cup quarter-final, where they held that season's treble-winning Rangers 1‚Äì1 at Bayview before losing narrowly 2‚Äì0 at Ibrox in the second-leg. In the League, East Fife finished fourth behind promoted sides Morton and Clyde, and were second-highest scorers after Morton with a total 92 league goals. This was the club's highest League finish in the six seasons since its relegation in 1958. In achieving this, Wright's side was the only team to defeat runaway champions Morton in the 36-game campaign ‚Äì winning 3‚Äì1 at Bayview on 1 February ‚Äì and ending the Greenock side's record-breaking winning run of 25 league matches. The Fifers were also undefeated against Clyde, drawing 1‚Äì1 at Bayview and winning 3‚Äì1 at Shawfield.The Breedon Book of Football Records 1871‚Äì2000, At the end of the season Wright decided to retire due to persistent knee injuries. He was 33. During his playing career he had prolonged absences due to five knee cartilage surgeries as well as a toe amputation after it was crushed in a match. Coaching & Managerial Career After retiring as a player, Wright immediately gained employment using his coaching certificates. He worked for part-time Clyde (throughout season 1964‚Äì65 under manager John Prentice) and Partick Thistle (from July 1965 until December 1966 under manager Willie Thornton). He was also the SFA appointed coach to Paisley & District Schools FA during this period. Having previously failed to sign him as a player, and being further impressed by Wright's performances against them in the Second Division for East Fife, Clyde employed Wright in the role of trainer/coach. The Shawfielders were blessed with fine attacking players such as Harry Hood, Joe Gilroy, Alex Bryce, Sammy Reid and Jim McLean, and Wright helped them finish 7th in the First Division on 40 points, a record haul for a promoted side. This prompted Partick Thistle to invite him back to Firhill as trainer/coach to the first team. In hindsight it can probably be seen that Thistle were beginning a downward slide towards relegation in 1970, however in 1965‚Äì66 they finished level with Clyde on 30 points. =St Mirren= Wright was appointed full-time manager of St Mirren in December 1966, aged 35, on the recommendation of former Clyde and Scotland manager John Prentice whom St Mirren had initially approached for the role. As St Mirren's only other full-time employee was the groundsman, Wright was also responsible for the day-to-day administration of the part-time club; from answering the telephone and selling tickets, to compiling the match programme and ordering the match-day pies. In terms of his interaction with the players, however, he was St Mirren's first track-suit manager. St Mirren had flirted with relegation throughout the early 1960s and eventually succumbed at the end of that 1966‚Äì67 season despite having 19-year-old Archie Gemmill in the side, but Wright guided them to promotion back to the top flight at the first attempt. and with one of the division's best-ever performance records. Back in the top division, and operating with a small squad of semi-professional players, St Mirren sat in 3rd position behind Celtic and Rangers following a run of only 3 defeats (away to Aberdeen, Celtic and Dunfermline Athletic) in the opening 22 matches, racking up 30 points in the process; i.e. a 68% points haul. To have averaged even a point-per-game in the remaining fixtures would have comfortably broken the record points total for a promoted team achieved by his Clyde side 3 years earlier and ended St Mirren's season as high as 5th position. However, a sudden spate of injuries badly disrupted the small squad, leaving only 2 of the club's 16 players fit enough to play in every match to the end of the season. A meagre two draws was the eventual return from those 12 games, in which there were also 6 tight odd-goal defeats. Nevertheless, the side remained in contention for European qualification until its final home fixture such was quality of the first two-thirds of the campaign. Arguably the most notable result of Wright's time at St Mirren came against Rangers on 16 November 1968. Newly promoted Saints were the last remaining undefeated side in Britain after the opening ten league fixtures, while Rangers arrived at Love Street on the crest-of-a-wave with newly signed Colin Stein having scored two successive League hat-tricks and a European double in his first three appearances. St Mirren won 1‚Äì0 in front of a reported 43,600, Love Street's largest attendance in two decades. Bridging these first two full seasons of Wright's time at St Mirren, his team went a calendar year and 34 consecutive league fixtures undefeated, from 18 November 1967 to 23 November 1968. During a similar period, St Mirren also went 38 competitive home games undefeated, from 2 September 1967 to 11 January 1969. Both of these runs remain as club records, as does the 16 consecutive league victories from 18 November 1967 to 30 March 1968. In 1969‚Äì70 season, the team suffered ‚Äòsecond season syndrome‚Äô, and results were extremely inconsistent with away form particularly poor, until a flurry of points in the final 10 fixtures ensured top division status. Behind the scenes, however, a reserve side had been resurrected and Wright's signing policy introduced three future full Scotland internationals to the club in addition to four others who would go on to play in European competition after leaving St Mirren. Season 1970‚Äì71 began with six teenagers making appearances in the side, including Gordon McQueen, Iain Munro, Bobby McKean and Ally McLeod. When he was approached to take over at Dunfermline Athletic in early October 1970 Wright's new-look Paisley side had won 8 points from an undefeated opening six league fixtures ‚Äì against Rangers, Kilmarnock, Morton, Dundee, Dunfermline Athletic, and Hibernian (2 wins and 4 draws) ‚Äì and were sitting comfortably in the top-half of the division. They were relegated at the end of the season. Paterson, McPherson & Wright, Marching On ... 125 Years of the St Mirren Football Club, Official History, 2005 =Dunfermline Athletic= Wright was head-hunted to become manager of Dunfermline Athletic in October 1970, with the initial approach made by former Dunfermline manager Jock Stein acting as intermediary. It was regarded as one of Scottish football's top club jobs outside of Celtic and Rangers, and Wright's full-time responsibilities centred solely on team matters, with an administrative staff in support. However, the Dunfermline team was in disarray. Despite having been European Cup-Winners' Cup semi-finalists as recently as March 1969, it opened the 1970‚Äì71 season with 14 defeats, and only two draws, in 16 competitive matches. Indeed, over the club's most recent 34 major Scottish league and cup matches (the length of a league season) from playing Dundee United on 10 December 1969 to Motherwell on 17 October 1970, the equivalent of only 17 points had been gathered. Such a total would have meant relegation in almost any previous post-war season. In addition, several players had taken a stand against manager George Farm with Alex Edwards, Barrie Mitchell and Willie Renton (ironically Wright's former captain at St Mirren) refusing to return to training after the summer break. Renton was made a scapegoat and sacked, while the others were retained but stayed away from the club until meeting with Wright in October. Wright quickly settled the players' grievances and immediately improved results, winning points from 7 of the 10 remaining fixtures until the turn of the year (against Dundee United, Rangers, Morton, Dundee, Hibernian, Airdrieonians and Ayr United, culminating in 4‚Äì1 and 5‚Äì0 home victories). Dunfermline eventually avoided relegation on goal-difference following a dramatic final series of results in which the team again picked up points in 7 of the closing 10 fixtures. However, he held the managerial position at Dunfermline for little over half of the following season as the club revealed an extent of financial hardship which almost led to its demise. As the club's bank threatened closure, Wright was forced to sell his three most effective attacking players ‚Äì Alex Edwards, Joe McBride and Pat Gardner ‚Äì and field a team largely formed from his previous two seasons' youth squads. In addition, influential senior players Bert Paton and John Lunn were lost to serious injury and illness. To cap a catalogue of misfortune, Club Chairman Leonard Jack, the man behind Alex Wright's appointment as manager, collapsed and died from a heart attack as he fought to stave off the financial crisis. On the field, 3 wins, 7 draws, and the failure to avoid a succession of narrow defeats, left the team again in a precarious league position after 23 fixtures despite a defensive record bettered only by the top half-dozen clubs. Goal scoring was the principal problem; registering 6 blanks, and scoring more than one goal on only 3 occasions (two 2‚Äì2 draws and a 2‚Äì3 defeat). When a new boardroom regime initiated further cost-cutting measures in February 1972, Wright was presented with a choice; remain with an immediate pay-cut and worsened conditions, or be replaced (as at St Mirren, he had opted to work without the protection of a contract). Having uprooted his family from the west coast at the club's insistence only five months earlier (in order to save on travelling expenses), Wright felt unable to accept the pay-cut being insisted upon and the club announced to the media that he and his assistant had resigned. In February 1972, former Dunfermline player George Miller was appointed to assume the combined responsibilities of Wright, his assistant manager Willie McLean, and the club's chief administrative assistant Mr J Smith. The club was relegated at the end of the season. The most noteworthy results of Wright's tenure at Dunfermline were a 1‚Äì1 draw at Celtic Park in the 1971 Scottish Cup, and successive 1‚Äì0 home victories over a strong Aberdeen side that finished both seasons second-placed in the League and with the best defensive record; * on 6 February 1971, becoming only the third team to defeat Aberdeen in its opening 24 league fixtures; * on 22 January 1972, becoming only the second team to defeat Aberdeen in its opening 22 League fixtures. Wright attributed these two victories to a particular tactical ploy targeting Aberdeen defender and captain Martin Buchan. After leaving Dunfermline, Wright worked the remainder of the 1971‚Äì72 season as Scottish scout for Bristol City under manager Alan Dicks. John Hunter, Dunfermline Athletic 1885‚Äì1985 Centenary History, 1985Paterson & Scott, Black & White Magic, 1984 =Dumbarton= Wright became assistant manager of newly promoted Dumbarton in May 1972. Following the departure of manager Jackie Stewart to St Johnstone in January 1973, Wright was appointed as his replacement ‚Äì initially on a part-time basis which he combined with a day-job of local government clerk, and then as full-time manager/secretary on a similar basis to his role at St Mirren. Jackie Stewart had spent 4 years at Boghead from December 1968, raising standards and expectation in lifting the team from 14th in D2 to Champions in the final match of season 1971‚Äì72. Wright maintained the progress and held the post for four relatively successful years before handing over to his assistant Davie Wilson. Despite Dumbarton having spent the previous 50 seasons in Division 2, Wright most notable achievements were to guide the team to an eighty-year high of tenth position in the Scottish League in 1973‚Äì74 and the semi-finals of both the Spring Cup and Scottish Cup in season 1975‚Äì76. Youth development was once again a significant feature of Wright's time at Dumbarton. His scouting and contacts network introduced future full Scotland internationalists Murdo MacLeod, Ian Wallace and Graeme Sharp to the senior game, as well as minor internationalists Graeme Sinclair and Owen Coyle. Scotland national team manager Willie Ormond proposed Wright to the SFA International Committee as his No. 2 in preparation for the World Cup in West Germany. However, the Committee failed to ratify Ormond's choice and instead of providing Ormond with an assistant, the SFA minutes confirm, initiated the process which would result in the later appointment of Scotland's first National Director of Coaching. Difficulties in his home life and frustration at failing to secure promotion back to the top flight following League reorganisation led Wright to offer his resignation in February 1977. Chairman Robert Robertson initially encouraged him to continue, before reluctantly accepting Wright's renewed request at the end of that season. Wright was given a directorship at the club which he then held until 1990. When Robertson sold Dumbarton to Sir Hugh Fraser in the 1980s he claimed that the club had never been as well run during his 16 years in charge as when Wright was manager. Wright later had a spell as caretaker manager in 1986 and led Dumbarton for a total of 209 national league and cup matches. His first three seasons were at the top level of the Scottish League; his remaining matches were in the upper echelons of the second tier following League reconstruction into three divisions in 1975. His total number of matches in charge is bettered only minimally by 1950s manager Peter McGown who was in charge for 216 matches at the lowest level of the Scottish League. Jim McAllister, The Sons of the Rock, Official History of Dumbarton Football Club, updated version 2002 Later Career and Legacy Wright was given a directorship in 1977 and remained at Dumbarton in various roles for a further 13 years, including Managing Director, Executive Director and Director of Football. In 1979, he fronted an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Dumbarton's owners to invest in the Toronto-based franchise for a proposed Canadian Soccer League. The following year he travelled to Amsterdam with team manager and fellow director Sean Fallon in the anticipation of signing Dutch legend Johan Cruyff following earlier negotiations with the player's agent. However, Cruyff ultimately decided against the move. Wright was widely credited with single-handedly keeping the club alive during an ownerless period in the mid-to-late 1980s and was named Dumbarton Citizen of the Year in recognition of his efforts. His salaried post was made redundant in late 1990 soon after a new regime had taken control, and Wright subsequently opted to relinquish his directorship and leave the club. After leaving Boghead Park in 1990, Wright then worked as full-time Chief Scout for Kilmarnock under managers Alex Totten and Bobby Williamson, until retiring to become Scottish Scout for Bruce Rioch at both Millwall and Bolton Wanderers, and then at Leeds United under David O'Leary. Wright's wholehearted and skilled contribution is widely recognised in footballing circles. Despite only serving a single season at Clyde and East Fife, he is remembered in the former's Centenary Brochure and the latter's historical display at their relocated Bayview Stadium. In addition to featuring in a hardback book of 'Partick Thistle Legends', Wright was posthumously inducted into the official 'St Mirren Hall of Fame' in November 2005. In 1986, he became only the fifth person honoured by an 'SFA Lifetime Achievement Award'. Wright's photograph is on permanent display at Hampden Park's Scottish Football Museum. In the 1991 pre-season, Sir Alex Ferguson brought his successful Manchester United European Cup-Winners' Cup team north to play a testimonial match in Alex Wright's honour. On the occasion of his death, his memory was honoured by full-page obituaries in the match programmes of former clubs Partick Thistle, East Fife, St Mirren and Dumbarton. There was widespread support among Dumbarton fans for Wright's name to be included in the title of Dumbarton's relocated home in 2000.

They are fossils dating from the Devonian to the Triassic. They were common during the Late Pennsylvanian to Early Permian, with most of the fossils coming from the Carboniferous period. Description Sphenophyllales are small, slender branching plants, usually growing to a height of less than tall. The long stems range from to in diameter. The stems are jointed and ribbed with weak habits, making it probable that these plants were vine or shrub-like when alive, and formed a portion of the understory in Carboniferous forests. The stem anatomy is protostelic (root-like), containing a solid primary xylem core with secondary xylem tissue present in some species. The leaves, which can be several centimeters long, are borne on each node in whorls (called verticels) and are wedge-shaped, fan-shaped, linear, or forked. Reproductive parts are either long terminal cones (consisting of two lobes, a sterile lower lobe and the fertile upper lobe bearing the sporangia) or loose strobili. All sphenophylls are homosporous, with monolete or trilete spores. Taxonomy Sphenophyllales was first described by the British botanist and geologist Albert Charles Seward in 1898. The name comes from the Greek words œÉœÜŒÆŒΩ (\\"wedge\\") and œÜœçŒªŒªŒøŒΩ (\\"leaf\\"). Sphenophyllalean taxonomy is often derived from isolated fossilized parts of plants and classification may be based on the morphology and anatomy of sterile plant parts (like leaves) or fructifications (mainly the fossilized cones and the stratigraphically-important spores found near them). This results in species that may actually by synonymous. Sphenophyllales is typified by the genus Sphenophyllum. Phylogeny The probable relationships within Equisetidae are shown in the cladogram below. The possible position of Ibyka has been added.

During the First World War he served as a cavalryman on the eastern front, was wounded, fired and joined the front theaters in Warsaw and ≈Å√≥d≈∫. During a commitment begun in 1917 at the Munich Volkstheater Fritz Kampers got to know the director Franz Seitz, who gave him some film engagements. Even as a film director, he appeared between 1917 and 1920 in appearance. In The Volkstyrann played under his direction the famous colleague Albert Steinr√ºck the main role. In 1920 he went to Berlin, where he worked for a year as a villain for Gustav Althoff's film company and at the same time on stages such as the Kleinen Schauspielhaus, the Lessingtheater, the German Theater and the Revue Theater \\"Admiralspalast\\" occurred. Kampers also became popular as a cabaret artist; For a time he was part of the ensemble of Trude Hesterberg's political- literary cabaret \\"Die Wilde B√ºhne\\". In the mid-1920s, Fritz Kampers changed roles and played as comic character actor pithy originals and neat soldiers and officers, often with Bavarian influence. The likeable of these guys, whom he successfully portrayed until the end of his film career, was the apparent antagonism of primordial robustness and bluntness on the one hand - Kampers' gestures were thrifty, his short sentences dry and almost deliberate - and wit, cunning, and unexpected depth on the other hand. The change to the sound film fell to Fritz Kampers easily. He had great roles in Max Obal's comedy \\"The Merry Musicians\\" (1930), in GW Pabst's films \\"West Front 1918\\" (1930) and \\"Comradeship\\" (1931), in \\"Three of the Stamp\\" (1932) and \\"Two Good Comrades \\"(1933). When many film artists went abroad in 1933 because of the Nazi entry into the government and the film industry was desperately looking for a suitable replacement, Kampers, who occasionally also directed in the period after the First World War, was given the opportunity to stage two of his own films: the Schwank \\"Konjunkturritter\\" (1933/34, with White Ferdl and Sabine Peters) and the confusion comedy \\"I sing 'into my heart\\" (1934, with Lien Deyers and Hans S√∂hnker). His acting career he continued under the regime of National Socialism. From 1934 he was part of the ensemble of the Berlin Volksb√ºhne and he also continued to appear in films - including in Nazi propaganda films such as \\"Three Emperor Hunters\\" (1933), \\"The Four Musketeers\\" (1934), \\"Holiday on Honor\\" (1937), \\"In the Name of the People\\" (1939), \\"Robert and Bertram\\" (1939), \\"The Fierce Devil\\" (1940), \\"About Everything in the World\\" and \\"Attack on Baku\\" (1941). Although Kampers 1939 by Joseph Goebbels was appointed a state actor, he seems to have rejected from 1942 on film offers in propaganda films but. Also in the post-war film Fritz Kampers soon found employment with supporting roles in films like \\"Sensation in Savoy\\" and \\"Schwarzwaldm√§del\\" (1950). Fritz Kampers was one of the most active actors in German film. Between 1918 and 1950 he has been involved in more than 260 films, that is every 17th film produced during this period. His resting place is on the Evangelical Cemetery in Neubeckum.

It was established in the 18th century, primarily producing grain. In the 19th century, it became the property of an Englishman by the name of Thomas Gillow. He passed the property to his son Eulogio Gillow, who became the first archbishop of Antequera (city of Oaxaca). Eulogio worked to modernize the hacienda, building the first hydroelectric dam in Latin America on the property. He also built the property's signature building, an English style residence, locally called \\"El Castillo\\" (The Castle) which overlooks the dam. Today, only a small fraction of the hacienda remains, and it is run as a recreational and cultural center by an agency of the state of Puebla. Description The present-day hacienda is located in the San Martin Texmelucan Valley, eight km outside the city of the same name, in the municipality of San Salvador el Verde. Located between Mexico City and Puebla, the hacienda lies within the Puebla metropolitan area. In the colonial era, the nearby highway which crosses the valley served as a market road that transported agricultural goods to the larger cities of Mexico City, Puebla and Veracruz. The area has a slightly cooler and wetter climate than Mexico City, and the property is ringed by the remains of what were large forests. Overall, the property measures about sixty hectares, thirty five of which is forest and twelve is surface water. The property includes the original manor house, a small lake formed by a dam built on the Atoyac River, and an English style residence hall on the edge of the lake. Facade of the main hacienda house The manor house was originally built by the Marquis of Selva Negra, the first owner of the property, but different parts of the complex date from different times. It is built at an elevation which overlooks the property, although trees block the view of the lake. The house now serves as the entrance to the hacienda and it is surrounded by a number of ash trees that are centuries old. Visitors enter a side portal into the inner courtyard. The courtyard fountain, built in 1941, is covered in Talavera plates and tiles. Opposite the fountain is a small chapel. The four flanks of the building enclosing the courtyard feature small watchtowers on the four outer corners. The entrance to the site museum is on the north side. The museum contains photographs, paintings, furniture and other items displayed among the former rooms of the house including the salon, the kitchen, the dining room and one of the bedrooms. Beside the manor house are the remains of other hacienda buildings such as horse stables. To reach the rest of the property, one exits the house into the east garden, which is one of several on the property. This garden contains a large white fountain flanked by two reflecting pools. In this garden, there are a number of paths, including one that leads to the lake and the English style residence. The lake is formed by a dam which was originally created by a former owner in the late 19th century. It covers about twelve hectares and is divided into two sections by a land bridge that leads to what is considered to be the most iconic building on the property. An English style residence house, locally called ‚ÄúEl Castillo‚Äù (The Castle), was originally built as a residence hall for teachers at a planned agricultural college by the same owner who created the dam. It is a brick building with white accents. Above the door of the main portal, the date of 1898 appears, the completion date. The facade faces the land bridge dividing the lake and allows views of the entire lake. Tourist attraction Overlooking the lake from the English style residence This area of the hacienda was strictly private property until it was turned into a cultural and recreational center by Instituto para la Asistencia P√∫blica del Estado de Puebla, a state agency. As such it promotes the main architectural elements (the main house and the residence hall) as well as the lake and the forest that surrounds it. The site offers activities such as sportfishing, camping, picnicking, and rents out facilities for events. The English style residence hall attracts many visitors. Its roof is open to the public, and its restaurant, named \\"El Castillo,\\" specializes in trout dishes. The other popular activity is fishing in the waters behind the dam for trout and other species which are stocked by an organization called \\"Amatzcalli.\\" A small grocery, a bait store, boat rental and fishing instruction are available. History One of the halls of the site museum The hacienda was created by Manuel Rodriguez de Pinillos y Lopez, who received the title of the first Marquis of Selva Nevada from Carlos III in 1777. However, this marquis never resided in it. It is one of a number of haciendas established in the valley which formed the basis of the local economy in the colonial period. The hacienda was originally established due to the natural resources, the availability of indigenous labor and its proximity to regional markets. The climate, abundance of water and fertile ground made it suitable for the production of grain. Initially, the hacienda raised corn and wheat on about 6,000 hectares, and included lands that are now incorporated into a number of ranches and villages in both Puebla and Tlaxcala states. The hacienda eventually became the inheritance of the fourth Marchioness of Selva Negra, Soledad Gutierrez de Rivero Martinez de Pinillos. She had a daughter from her first marriage by the name of Mara Zavala y Gutierrez. In the 1820s, she was remarried, to an Englishman by the name of Thomas Gillow. Gillow was born in Liverpool, England in 1797 and arrived in Mexico in 1819, during the Mexican War of Independence. He became a fashionable jeweler and member of Mexico City society, allowing him to meet and then marry the Marchioness. Following his marriage, Gillow dedicated himself to running the family estate. After the marchioness died, Gillow married her daughter Mara. This may have been at least partly in order to end problems connected to the inheritance of the estate following the death of the marchioness' first husband. However, this marriage between Thomas and Mara was never formally sanctioned by the church. The union produced Eulogio Gillow. Gate at site entrance When Mara died at sea in 1861, there were inheritance problems yet again, with Thomas Gillow receiving the Chautla Hacienda. He sold off a small portion of the estate in 1870, the first lands to be separated. When Thomas died in 1877, the remaining lands were inherited by Eulogio. Under Eulogio, the hacienda specialized in wheat and maguey production, and he worked to introduce modern technology and organizational methods. =Agricultural innovations, first hydroelectric plant in Latin America= Eulogio Gillow introduced electricity in 1903 by building Latin America's first hydroelectric power plant on the estate. His father had introduced the first metal plough, importing it from England, but it had worn so quickly that he later helped a Mr. Marshall establish an iron foundry in Puebla. Marshall went on to make a considerable fortune out of the manufacture and repair of farm and textile equipment. Eulogio also acquired other technology such as a threshing machine developed in the United States. Unfortunately, the machine did not work well at the Chautla Hacienda, because the grain produced was coarser than the U.S. varieties. The threshing machine was left to rust in a shed. Eulogio offered to donate the machine to the Smithsonian Institution, but only on condition that it be exhibited with a large sign saying, \\"This machine, awarded a gold medal in the Philadelphia exhibition, proved to be entirely useless in Mexico.\\" Eulogio also worked to establish an agricultural college on the property, and built the English-style residence house on the dam to house teachers. It originally had a drawbridge, artificial lakes and formal, symmetrical gardens. People fishing with the \\"castle\\" in the background =Expropriation during the Mexican Revolution= Eulogio was a priest, and a favorite in ecclesiastical and political circles. He was strongly allied with Porfirio D√≠az, and officiated at his 1881 marriage. In 1887, Eulogio was appointed Bishop of Antequera (Oaxaca). Four years later, he became the first Archbishop of Antequera (city of Oaxaca). As Archbishop he worked to build schools, preserve colonial architecture and pushed for a railway connection between Mexico City and Oaxaca. Eulogio lost most of the lands of the hacienda when the people of Mexico rose up against the Porfirio D√≠az regime and the Hacienda feudal system during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1921). These lands were divided among local peasant farmers in 1914. A number of the hacienda's buildings were destroyed during the war, as well as furniture and administrative archives. =Public recreational and cultural center= Eulogio left for the United States and settled in Los Angeles. He returned in 1921 after the war and negotiated the return of 150 hectares of the former hacienda, which he received shortly before his death. His descendants sold off parts of this land, leaving the sixty hectares which were eventually sold to the state of Puebla. Since then it has been run as a recreational and cultural center. The site has been also used in the filming of Mexican telenovelas such as \\"Dulce desaf√≠o\\", \\"Pueblo chico, infierno grande\\" and \\"El Maleficio.\\" In 2000, an organization called Amatzcalli restored the lake behind the dam for sportfishing, stocking it with trout and other species.

A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, he represented District 32B, which included portions of Chisago County just north of the Twin Cities metropolitan area. Early life, education, and career Barrett graduated from Minnesota State University, Mankato in Mankato, receiving his B.A. in Accounting in 1989. Active in his community, he served on the Chisago Lakes School District Finance Team, and was also a school district mentor. He is a sports referee and umpire, officiating for basketball, football, baseball and softball games. He is the Director of Market Research and Marketing Analysis for the Hazelden Foundation. Minnesota House of Representatives Barrett was first elected to the House in 2010. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. False campaign literature distribution and conviction On February 5, 2013, Representative Barrett was fined $1000 for disseminating campaign literature that misrepresented the record of his opponent in the previous election. The Administrative Law Judge Panel concluded that the false information \\"likely had some impact on voters\\" in Barrett's 51%/49% victory. (Barrett) stated that his opponent ‚Äúdid not serve on the education committee even though our schools need help.‚Äù Barrett‚Äôs challenger Rick Olseen did sit on an education committee when he served as a state senator. Residency questions In 2014, Barrett's residency in the district that he represented came into question. Evidence submitted included photos of the empty house and affidavits from neighbors claiming that Barrett indeed, was not observed as being a resident of the home in question. In August 2014 District Court Judge George Stephenson ruled that \\"Despite his own doubts\\" about Barrett's residency, that the evidence was insufficient. Again in 2016, Barrett's residency was brought before the same judge that had ruled in 2014 that Barrett's residency evidence was \\"insufficient\\". In early August, evidence collected from a group of advocates were administered into a formal complaint against Barrett and his claim of residency in his own district. The Second Judicial District Judge George Stephenson found ‚Äúclear and convincing evidence‚Äù that Barrett didn‚Äôt live in House District 32B. His opinion questioned the legitimacy of Mr. Barrett's testimony, including the fact that Mr. Barrett did not establish \\"cable/satellite television, internet, trash pickup, or a washer and dryer\\" at his residence. He also noted that among more than 30 visits, Barrett never was available at the home in question. Mr. Barrett had rented from a campaign contributor the house in Taylor's Falls, MN for $300 a month, about 1/4 of which a rental property of the size and scale could be expected from a similar property in the area. The Minnesota Supreme Court heard an appeal on the ballot removal on September 6, 2016. On September 9, 2016, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld the ruling removing Barrett from the November ballot. A special election was held on Feb 14, 2017 for this seat. (Until then, the seat remained vacant during the start of the 2017 legislative session.) The Minnesota Republican Party was required to choose a candidate for that special election by Nov 15, 2016. This person must have resided in the district before Aug 14, 2016, 6 months before the special election. (This eliminated Bob Barrett, who the court had ruled does not live in the district.) On February 14, 2017, the seat was won by fellow Republican Anne Neu. References  External links  * Project Votesmart - Rep.

He was the key cleric in President Porfirio D√≠az's policy of conciliation with the Roman Catholic Church, which kept the anticlerical articles of the liberal Constitution of 1857 in place but suspended their implementation.Timothy J. Henderson, \\"Eulogio Gregorio Gillow y Zavala\\", in Encyclopedia of Mexico vol. 1, 598, Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997. Life Archbishop of Oaxaca, Eulogio Gillow y Zavala, key broker of Porfirio D√≠az's policy of conciliation with the Catholic Church Born at Puebla, Mexico in 1841, he was the member of a wealthy and socially prominent family, the son of an English Catholic from Lancashire, Thomas Gillow, who immigrated to Mexico in 1819, and Mar√≠a Zavala y Guti√©rrez, who inherited the title of the Marchioness of Selva Nevada. Originally Thomas Gillow was a jeweler, but he became a successful agricultural businessman, managing his wife's estates, and keenly interested in improving farming methods in Mexico.Henderson, \\"Gillow\\", p. 98. In 1851, Gillow father and son attended The Great Exhibition in London; and young Eulogio remained in England for education, attending the Jesuit college of Stonyhurst.Henderon, \\"Gillow\\", p. 98. After Stonyhurst, Gillow continued his studies at the College of Aalst and the Universit√© de Namur, both in Belgium. This was followed by studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University and Sapienza University of Rome. He went to Rome in 1862, and gained an audience with Pope Pius IX, who encouraged him to study for the priesthood. Gillow was in Rome for the celebrations for Maximilian of Habsburg as he prepared to go to Mexico to become Emperor at the invitation of Mexican conservatives. Gillow returned to Mexico during Maximilian's Second Mexican Empire and was ordained at the cathedral in Puebla in 1869.Henderson, \\"Gillow\\", p. 599. He had impressed Pius XI and returned to Rome to serve as the pope's private chamberlain. During the First Vatican Council, Gillow was a theological adviser to the archbishop of Oaxaca. Before his return to Mexico, Gillow was appointed by the pope to an office that connected him directly with the Roman Curia rather than the episcopal hierarchy in Mexico. He inherited the Chautla Hacienda located in the rich valley of Puebla and on his return to Mexico devoted more of his attention to his family estate than to ecclesiastical matters. As the son of an agricultural entrepreneur who had a great interest in improving agriculture in Mexico, Gillow followed in his father's footsteps, involving himself in the Mexican Agricultural Society. At this hacienda, he built modern infrastructure, including the first hydroelectric plant in Latin America, as well as telegraph and telephone lines, imported the latest agricultural machinery, and gained railroad concessions. He built an English-style residence (locally known as ‚ÄúEl Castillo‚Äù (The Castle)) for a planned agricultural school. As a promoter of modern agriculture, he participated in expositions, which is how he came to the attention of Porfirio D√≠az, a liberal former general who as president promoted modernization in Mexico, including foreign investment. Gillow organized an exposition in Puebla, where his estate was located, and there was hope of attracting investors from the U.S. D√≠az himself opened the exposition, with multilingual Gillow as his interpreter and intermediary with businessmen.Henderson, \\"Gillow\\" p. 599. The relationship between Gillow and D√≠az was the key to easing the Church-State conflict in Mexico.Henderson, \\"Gillow\\" p. 598. When the widowed D√≠az married his second wife, seventeen- year-old Carmen Romero Rubio, the daughter of one of his key advisers, he asked Gillow preside,Enrique Krauze, Mexico: Biography of Power, New York: Harper Collins 1997, p. 227. but Gillow suggested that the archbishop of Mexico and prominent supporter of the Second Mexican Empire to do the honors. Symbolically it was powerful, demonstrating the liberal D√≠az's respect for the Church and the easing of the position of a prominent conservative cleric. He was named archbishop of Oaxaca in 1891,The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, 1917, p. 66 which D√≠az was pleased with. Gillow and D√≠az exchanged expensive and symbolic gifts, a pastoral ring with a large emerald to Gillow, a jeweled representation of Napoleon's victories to D√≠az.Krauze, Mexico, p. 227. Gillow's post as archbishop in D√≠az's home state had a number of benefits, due to his political and ecclesiastic connections. As such he worked to get a railway connection between Mexico City and Oaxaca and worked to open schools and preserve a number of the city‚Äôs colonial churches. During the Mexican Revolution, his estate in Puebla was seized by Constitutionalist forces. Gillow went into exile in Los Angeles, but returned to Mexico just prior to his death in 1922. He was archbishop until his death in 1922. According to one scholar, Gillow was the model for D.H. Lawrence's character of Bishop Severn in The Plumed Serpent (1926).Ross Parmenter, Lawrence in Oaxaca: a Quest for the Novelist in Mexico, Salt Lake City: G.M. Smith 1984.

His sudden and premature death was popularly believed to be due to a chill caught when watching an eclipse of the sun.  Background  He was born at Crumlin, Dublin, son of Joseph Deane (of Deanehill, County Meath) and his wife Elizabeth Parker, daughter of John Parker, Archbishop of Dublin, and his wife Mary Clarke. His grandfather Major Joseph Deane was a close associate of Oliver Cromwell and a cousin of Richard Deane, the regicide. For his good services to Cromwell, the Major received large grants of land in five counties. On the Restoration of Charles II he managed to retain much of his property, including Crumlin and Terenure in Dublin. While the judge's brother Edward inherited most of the Deane estates including Terenure, Joseph inherited the Crumlin estate. He also owned a manor at Old Leighlin, County Carlow, which he later sold to the local Bishop, Bartholomew Vigors. The Bishop in turn bequeathed it to his successors in perpetuity.  Career  Deane matriculated in the University of Dublin in 1689 and entered Gray's Inn in 1694. He was called to the Bar and sat in the Irish House of Commons from 1703 to 1714 as member for County Dublin. He enjoyed the friendship of the powerful William King, Archbishop of Dublin who recommended him to the English Crown as a man of great sense, knowledge of the law, honesty and good temper. Deane was made a Privy Councillor and on the accession of King George I he became the Irish Chief Baron.  Death  Barely eight months after taking office Deane died suddenly in May 1715, just after returning from his first assize. According to popular belief, as reported by his friend Archbishop King, his death was due to catching cold while watching the solar eclipse of May 3, 1715, as the weather was exceptionally cold and wet for May.Mason, William Monck The History and Antiquities of the Collegiate and Cathedral Church of St. Patrick's Dublin Dublin 1820 Elrington Ball more prosaically states that his death was probably due to gout.Ball, F.

Family  Deane married Margaret Boyle, daughter of Colonel Henry Boyle and Lady Mary O'Brien, and sister of Henry Boyle, 1st Earl of Shannon. Their only son died young, and the judge's estates passed to his five daughters, all of whom married into the aristocracy.Debrett's Complete Peerage They were: *Elizabeth, who married Hayes St. Leger, 4th Viscount Doneraile *Barbara, who married Arthur Hill- Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, but died young, without issue *Mary, who married John Bourke, 1st Earl of Mayo *Catherine, who married John Lysaght, 1st Baron Lisle *Margaret, who married John FitzGerald, 15th Knight of Kerry  References  Category:Politicians from County Dublin Category:1674 births Category:1715 deaths Category:17th-century Irish people Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:Irish MPs 1703‚Äì1713 Category:Irish MPs 1713‚Äì1714 Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Dublin constituencies Category:People from Crumlin, Dublin ","title":"Joseph Deane"},{"id":"30641923","text":"Varady with this team Jonathan Okwir and Varady featured on the Foxtel/Netflix documentary \\"Road to Freedom Peak\\" Corrin Varady is an author and Edtech entrepreneur.Varady, Corrin. \\"The world that speaks but doesn't hear\\", The Huffington Post, 25 October 2010 Varady founded a digital education company, IDEA Digital Education in 2015.http://www.ideaonline.com Education Varady holds two master's degrees (Universit√† Commerciale Luigi Bocconi/University of New South Wales and the London School of Economics) with First Class Honours and a PhD at the London School of Economics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7FUX_dSiKg Varady's book published by Palgrave Macmillan is titled 'Vigorous Self Defense' and challenges the use of military force in peacekeeping missions.https://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9783319539720 He has lectured at both the University of Cape Town and Witwatersrand University, South Africa.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/journey_with_a_child_soldier He has also written for the Huffington Post, USA.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/corrin-varady Career = IDEA Digital Education = Varady founded IDEA Digital Education to create and deliver STEM fields digital education content to primary and secondary students across Africa and the Middle East.

Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which Twitter enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content (such as a tweet) is illegal in their jurisdiction. Restrictions based on government request Twitter acts on complaints by third parties, including governments, to remove illegal content in accordance with the laws of the countries in which people use the service. On processing a successful complaint about an illegal tweet from \\"government officials, companies or another outside party\\", the social networking site will notify users from that country that they may not see it. =France= Following the posting of an antisemitic and racist posts by anonymous users, Twitter removed those posts from its service. Lawsuits were filed by the Union of Jewish Students (UEJF), a French advocacy group and, on January 24, 2013, Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud ordered Twitter to divulge the personally identifiable information about the user who posted the antisemitic post, charging that the posts violated French laws against hate speech. Twitter responded by saying that it was \\"reviewing its options\\" regarding the French charges. Twitter was given two weeks to comply with the court order before daily fines of ‚Ç¨1,000 (about US$1,300) would be assessed. Issues over jurisdiction arise, because Twitter has no offices nor employees within France, so it is unclear how a French court could sanction Twitter. =India= Twitter accounts spoofing the Prime Minister of India such as \\"PM0India\\", \\"Indian-pm\\" and \\"PMOIndiaa\\" were blocked in India in August 2012 following violence in Assam. During the curfew in Jammu and Kashmir after Indian revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status on 5 August 2019, the Indian government approached Twitter to suspend accounts which were spreading rumours and anti-India content. This included the Twitter account of Syed Ali Shah Geelani, a Kashmiri separatist leader.Twitter told to take down handles spreading fake news about Kashmir Valley , The Economic Times (August 13, 2019) On 3 August 2019, Geelani tweeted \\"India is about to launch the biggest genocide in the history of mankind\\" to spread panic among masses and create hysteria, leading which, his account was suspended on request by authorities. Two days later, on August 5, the Indian parliament passed resolution to bifurcate the Jammu and Kashmir state into two union territories. =Israel= In 2016, access to comments by the American blogger Richard Silverstein about a criminal investigation, which involved a minor and therefore was under a gag order according to Israeli law, was blocked to Israeli IP addresses, following a request by Israel's Ministry of Justice. =Pakistan= As of May 2014, Twitter regularly disables the ability to view specific \\"tweets\\" inside Pakistan, at the request of the Government of Pakistan on the grounds that they are blasphemous, having done so five times in that month. On November 25, 2017, the NetBlocks internet shutdown observatory and Digital Rights Foundation collected evidence of nation-wide blocking of Twitter alongside other social media services, imposed by the government in response to the religious political party Tehreek-e-Labaik protests. The technical investigation found that all major Pakistani fixed- line and mobile service providers were affected by the restrictions, which were lifted by the PTA the next day when protests abated following the resignation of Minister for Law and Justice Zahid Hamid. =Russia= On May 19, 2014, Twitter blocked a pro-Ukrainian political account for Russian users. It happened soon after, a Russian official had threatened to ban Twitter entirely if it refused to delete \\"tweets\\" that violated Russian law, according to the Russian news site Izvestia.\\"Twitter Blocks Pro-Ukrainian Political Account for Russian Users\\" , Brian RiesMay, Mashable, May 19, 2014. On July 27, 2014, Twitter blocked an account belonging to a hacker collective that has leaked several internal Kremlin documents to the Internet.\\"Twitter 'Blocks' Access to Russia's Most Infamous Hackers\\" , Kevin Rothrock, Global Voices Online, July 27, 2014. =South Korea= In August 2010, the Government of South Korea tried to block certain content on Twitter due to the North Korean government opening a Twitter account. The North Korean Twitter account created on August 12, uriminzok, loosely translated to mean \\"our people\\" in Korean, acquired over 4,500 followers in less than one week. On August 19, 2010, South Korea's state-run Communications Standards Commission banned the Twitter account for broadcasting \\"illegal information.\\" According to BBC US and Canada, experts claim that North Korea has invested in \\"information technology for more than 20 years\\" with knowledge of how to use social networking sites. This appears to be \\"nothing new\\" for North Korea as the reclusive country has always published propaganda in its press, usually against South Korea, calling them \\"warmongers.\\" With only 36 \\"tweets\\", the Twitter account was able to accumulate almost 9,000 followers. To date, the South Korean Commission has banned 65 sites, including this Twitter account. =Turkey= On April 20, 2014, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, FAZ, reported Twitter had blocked two regime hostile accounts in Turkey, @Bascalan and @Haramzadeler333, both known for pointing out corruption. In fact, on March 26, 2014, Twitter announced that it started to use its Country Withheld Content tool for the first time in Turkey. As of June 2014, Twitter was withholding 14 accounts and \\"hundreds of tweets\\" in Turkey. Turkey submitted the highest volume of removal requests to Twitter in 2014, 2015, ...Turkey accounted for more than half of all content removal requests sent to Twitter during the second half of 2016, a ranking it has topped for three years. and 2016. =Venezuela= Twitter images were temporarily blocked in Venezuela in February 2014, along with other sites used to share images, including Pastebin.com and Zello, a walkie-talkie app. In response to the block, Twitter offered Venezuelan users a workaround to use their accounts via text message on their mobile phones. On February 27, 2019, internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported the blocking of Twitter by state- run Internet provider CANTV for a duration of 40 minutes. The disruption followed the sharing of a tweet made by opposition leader Juan Guaid√≥ linking to a highly critical recording posted to SoundCloud, which was also restricted access during the incident. The outages were found to be consistent with a pattern of brief, targeted filtering of other social platforms established during the country's presidential crisis. Government blocking of Twitter access In some cases, governments and other authorities take unilateral action to block Internet access to Twitter or its content. , the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, and Turkmenistan have blocked access to Twitter in those countries. =China= Twitter is blocked in China; however, many Chinese people circumvent the block to use it. Even major Chinese companies and national medias, such as Huawei and CCTV, use Twitter through a government approved VPN. The official account of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs started tweeting in English in December 2019, meanwhile dozens of Chinese diplomats, embassies and consulates run their accounts on twitter. In 2010, Cheng Jianping was sentenced to one year in a labor camp for \\"retweeting\\" a comment that suggested boycotters of Japanese products should instead attack the Japanese pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo. Her fianc√©, who posted the initial comment, claims it was actually a satire of anti-Japanese sentiment in China. According to the report of the Washington Post, in 2019, state security officials visited some users in China to request them deleting tweets. The Chinese police would produce printouts of tweets and advise users to delete either the specific messages or their entire accounts. The New York Times described \\"the crackdown (of the twitter users in China) is unusually broad and punitive\\". The targets of the crackdown even included those Twitter lurkers with very few followers. In 2019, a Chinese student at the University of Minnesota was arrested and sentenced to six months in prison when he returned to China, for posting tweets mocking Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping while in US. On 3 July 2020, Twitter announced that all data and information requests for Hong Kong authorities were immediately paused after Hong Kong national security law, which was imposed by the Chinese government, went into effect. =Egypt (2011 temporary block)= Twitter was inaccessible in Egypt on January 25, 2011 during the 2011 Egyptian protests. Some news reports blamed the government of Egypt for blocking it. Vodafone Egypt, Egypt's largest mobile network operator, denied responsibility for the action in a tweet. Twitter's news releases did not state who the company believed instituted the block. As of January 26, Twitter was still confirming that the service was blocked in Egypt. On January 27, various reports claimed that access to the entire Internet from within Egypt had been shut down. Shortly after the Internet shutdown, engineers at Google, Twitter, and SayNow, a voice-messaging startup company acquired by Google in January, announced the Speak To Tweet service. Google stated in its official blog that the goal of the service was to assist Egyptian protesters in staying connected during the Internet shutdown. Users could phone in a \\"tweet\\" by leaving a voicemail and use the Twitter hashtag #Egypt. These comments could be accessed without an Internet connection by dialing the same designated phone numbers. Those with Internet access could listen to the comments by visiting twitter.com/speak2tweet. On February 2, 2011, connectivity was re-established by the four main Egyptian service providers. A week later, the heavy filtering that occurred at the height of the revolution had ended. =Iran= In 2009, during 2009 Iranian presidential election, the Iranian government blocked Twitter due to fear of protests being organised. In September 2013, the blocking of both Twitter and Facebook was briefly lifted without notice due to a technical error, however, within a day the sites were blocked again. =North Korea= In April 2016, North Korea started to block Twitter \\"in a move underscoring its concern with the spread of online information\\". Anyone who tries to access it without special permission from the North Korean government, including foreign visitors, is subject to punishment. =Turkey (2014 temporary block)= On March 21, 2014, access to Twitter in Turkey was temporarily blocked, after a court ordered that \\"protection measures\\" be applied to the service. This followed earlier remarks by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan who vowed to \\"wipe out Twitter\\" following damaging allegations of corruption in his inner circle.\\"Twitter website 'blocked' in Turkey\\" , BBC News, March 20, 2014. Retrieved March 23, 2014. However, on March 27, 2014, Istanbul Anatolia 18th Criminal Court of Peace suspended the above-mentioned court order. Turkey's constitutional court later ruled that the ban is illegal. Two weeks after the Turkish government blocked the site, the Twitter ban was lifted. However, , Twitter reports that the government of Turkey accounts for more than 52 percent of all content removal requests worldwide. =Turkmenistan= , foreign news and opposition websites are blocked in Turkmenistan, and international social networks such as Twitter are \\"often inaccessible\\". =United Kingdom (2011 threat of temporary block)= Then- Prime Minister David Cameron threatened to shut down Twitter among other social networking sites for the duration of the 2011 England riots, but no action was taken. Suspending and restricting users Under Twitter's Terms of Service which requiring users agreement, Twitter retains the right to temporarily or permanently suspend user accounts based on violations. One such example took place on December 18, 2017, when it banned the accounts belonging to Paul Golding, Jayda Fransen, Britain First, and the Traditionalist Worker Party.. More recently, Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has faced a limited degree of censorship. Trump has used the platform extensively for communication with the country, and has escalated tensions with other nations through his tweets. Twitter's policies have been described as subject to manipulation by users who may coordinate to flag politically controversial tweets as allegedly violating the platform's policies, resulting in deplatforming of controversial users. The platform has long been criticized for its failure to provide details of underlying alleged policy violations to the subjects of Twitter suspensions and bans. In 2018, Twitter rolled out a \\"quality filter\\" that hid content and users deemed \\"low quality\\" from search results and limited their visibility, leading to accusations of shadow banning. After conservatives claimed it censors users from the political right, Alex Thompson, a writer for VICE, confirmed that many prominent Republican politicians had been \\"shadow banned\\" by the filter. Twitter later acknowledged the problem, stating that the filter had a software bug that would be fixed in the near future. In October 2020, Twitter prevented users to tweeting about a New York Post article relating to emails about Hunter Biden allegedly introducing a Ukrainian businessman to his father, Joe Biden. Some Republican leaders stated that the prevention to post the New York Post article was 'election interference'.https://nypost.com/2020/10/17/twitter- censoring-posts-biden-expose-is-election-interference-gop/ See also * Deplatforming * Shadow banning * Twitter suspensions References Twitter Twitter ","title":"Censorship of Twitter"},{"id":"30642037","text":"Brett Elliott Jackson (born August 2, 1988) is an American former professional baseball center fielder.

It is located north-northwest of Winnemucca, Nevada. It was closed in 1968. History Winnemucca Air Force Station was established as part of the planned deployment by Air Defense Command of forty- four Mobile radar stations across the United States to support the permanent Radar network established during the Cold War for air defense of the United States. This deployment had been projected to be operational by mid-1952. Funding, constant site changes, construction, and equipment delivery delayed deployment. Winnemucca AFS typified some of the problems with the mobile radar program. Because the program received minimal funding, the cantonment area was sited on Department of the Interior land located several miles away from the radar, rather than on adjacent land owned by the Southern Pacific Land Company. Delays in the decision-making process set the date for beneficial occupancy back to 1955. The station was activated on 8 June 1955 after the 658th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was moved to the new station on 1 February 1956 by the 28th Air Division. Operational status was finally achieved by the 658th AC&W; Squadron in 1956. The site used an AN/FPS-3 radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. By 1959 this radar had been joined by a pair of AN/FPS-6B height-finder radars. In 1960 the AN/FPS-3 was replaced by an AN/FPS-20 search set. At the end of 1961 this search set had been upgraded into an AN/FPS-66. During 1961 Winnemucca AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-21 at Stead AFB, Nevada. After joining, the squadron was re-designated as the 658th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 March 1961. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1963 the two height-finder radars were converted to AN/FPS-90 units, and on 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-127. In 1967 one AN/FPS-90 was removed from service. In addition to the main facility, Winnemucca operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Quinn River Crossing, NV (M-127A): * Unionville, NV (M-127B): The 658th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated on 18 June 1968 as a result of budget restrictions, and the general phase down of air defense radar stations. The former station is now a commercial transmitter site, the former Air Force radar towers still standing. Some of the support buildings at the site are standing in deteriorated condition. A number of former Air Force buildings (including Quonset huts) in the Cantonment and barracks areas are in use by Humboldt County and commercial firms, and the pool is now open to the public (in season). Some buildings have also been built since the Air Force closed the base. The Officers' Quarters area houses are now used as private housing. The area is now known as \\"Sage Heights,\\" a reference to the area's history.

A spectroscopic binary is called double- lined when the absorption lines of both stars can be observed with a spectroscope. As each member of the star system approaches the observer in turn, the absorption lines of that star are shifted toward the blue end of the optical spectrum by the Doppler effect. Likewise, as a star moves away, its lines are shifted toward the red end of the spectrum. Each of these absorption lines has a characteristic strength that depends on the physical properties of the photosphere. The Struve‚ÄìSahade effect occurs when these lines become anomalously weaker as a star's spectrum is red-shifted, and stronger when it is blue-shifted, most noticeable in the secondary component. This effect is observed in the bright naked eye binary Spica, which consists of two class B stars, and pairs of massive O class stars such as AO Cassiopeiae and HD 93403. The Struve‚ÄìSahade effect was first reported by Otto Struve in 1937. It became important because the effect called into question the values of parameters such as mass and luminosity ratios in massive spectroscopic binary systems. In 1950, Struve attempted to explain the effect as the result of streams of gas trailing behind the secondary star, causing the star to be obscured when the star was moving away. In 1959, Jorge Sahade produced a model where a gaseous stream extended from the primary to the secondary member of the binary, and the opacity of this stream produced the weakening of the absorption lines. The effect then became known as the Struve‚ÄìSahade effect. In 1997, Gies and colleagues provided an alternative explanation, arguing that the collision between the stellar winds from the two stars results in a bow shock that is deflected by the Coriolis force, placing it in an obscuring position along the line of sight to the secondary star. Other hypotheses have since been created to explain this effect, but models still do not fully reproduce the observed line strengths.

Pits had been sunk in the 1730s and in the 1740s John Heathcote who owned the pits employed Matthew Fletcher. The Fletchers had extensive interests in coal mining in the area and, by the 1750s, Fletcher owned the collieries.

It was filmed in 2010 the Peak District in Derbyshire just outside the village of Longnor, and stars Kierston Wareing, Vincent Regan and David Bradley. It is written by James Dormer and is produced by Alex Boden, George Mizen and Terry Stone.  Plot  The film opens on the dead body of Dean (Christopher Brand) being dragged into a shallow grave in the dead of night by his wife, Cassie Naylor (Keirston Wareing) and the old farm hand Cooper (David Bradley). As they carry out a rudimentary and hurried burial, all the while they are unknowingly being watched by Cassie's 8 year old daughter, Amy (Maisie Lloyd). The story then jumps to eight months later. Cassie is struggling; her relationship with her two daughters, Amy and Hannah (Skye Lourie) is fractious. She is struggling to run her farm and her financial situation is so bad that she can no longer afford to pay Cooper. She is visited by a sinister neighbouring farmer, Karsten (Terry Stone) who is eager to buy Cassie's farm and marry her, both of which Cassie declines. Enter Aden (Vincent Regan), an old friend of Dean's who was passing. Quick to cover up her secret, Cassie tells Aden that Dean left. Aden asks if he can stay the night and after some convincing from Amy, Cassie reluctantly concedes. The next day Aden persuades Cassie that he can be of use to her on the farm and Cassie allows him to stay on, much to the displeasure of Cassie's 16-year-old daughter Hannah who immediately dislikes Aden, sussing out his intentions of getting \\"into my mum's knickers\\". Karsten's interest in Cassie escalates as his jealousy of Aden mounts. He throws around irrational threats, gloatingly kills one of Cassie's calves and builds a roadblock denying Cassie access to the outside world. This is the last straw and Aden tells Cassie that he will \\"talk to Karsten\\". But instead Aden kills Karsten and his brother, Noah (Jake Curran) in cold blood. Life on Cassie's farm settles down as she believes that Aden had a strong word with Karsten and she quickly falls for him. Aden helps Cassie out with her finances, making a good deal on cattle feed and suggesting that she get rid of Cooper as he is costing too much. It's after the firing of Cooper that Hannah confronts Aden, knowing that what he really wants is to control the family. Aden enjoys her teenage bravado, and quickly retorts with his knowledge of Hannah's deepest secret: Dean's abuse of her. Stunned and hurt, Hannah flees the farm. What follows is Aden's irrational hunting of his \\"daughter\\", much to Cassie's shock. When he returns to the farm without Hannah, Aden strikes Cassie. He is clearly deranged and Cassie walks him off her property at gunpoint making it clear that if he ever came back she would kill him. She tracks down Hannah and for the first time in a long time, mother and daughter connect. Hannah promises to return in the morning. That night, Cassie finds Dean's wedding ring amongst Aden's things. Spooked, she traipses back to Dean's unmarked grave with shovel in hand and digs up the grave only to find it empty. She contacts Cooper stating that \\"there's no body\\". The next morning Cooper and Cassie find her prized bull dead, throat slit. This is the last straw for Cassie and she marches up to Karsten's place determined to sell her holding to him, but what she finds is the rotting, fly-ridden bodies of Karsten and Noah, and Aden living in the house. Cassie tries to escape with Amy but Aden knocks her out and takes her and Amy back to the farm. As Cassie comes round, Aden confesses all: Dean was not dead, but escaped from the grave and fled back to the oil rigs - the only other place he knew. There he told Aden everything; the abuse of Hannah and his \\"murder\\". Aden tells Cassie of his disdain of the man who \\"had everything and pissed it away\\". Realising that she is now in the hands of a psychopath, Cassie tries to talk Aden round but all he wants is for them to be a family. The moment Hannah returns home, Aden locks Cassie and her daughters in Hannah's room. It is here where the truth comes out and for the first time, as mother and daughter talk about Dean's abuse. Cassie confesses that she tried to kill Dean when she found out about him abusing Hannah, but he escaped and went back to the rigs. Amy admits to seeing her mother bury her father's body. Now with all the secrets out in the open, the three of them bond and unite. What follows is Aden's attempt at playing \\"happy families\\", and the girls attempt at ridding themselves of Aden. Together they manage to lure him to the slurry pit. Little Amy surprises Aden and pushes him into the cavernous pit of cow excrement. In the final moments, Cassie spots Aden's lighter in the mud, she strikes it and lets it fall into the methane-filled cavity. The pit and the surrounding methane erupt in a massive explosion, leaving Cassie, Hannah and Amy clinging to each other, as a family.

The 2004 Southampton Council election took place on 10 June 2004 to elect members of Southampton Unitary Council in Hampshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrat 19 *Labour 15 *Conservative 14 Campaign Since the last election in 2003 the Liberal Democrats had run the council as a minority administration, after Labour had previously been in charge for 19 years. The record of the Liberal Democrats for the previous year was a major issue in the election, with the Liberal Democrats pointing to investment in road repairs and in addressing anti-social behaviour, while campaigning for council tax to be replaced by a local income tax. However the Labour and Conservative parties attacked the Liberal Democrats for u-turns such as the stopping of plans for fortnightly refuse collection, charges for parking in the town centre and the dropping of schemes to close football pitches and a leisure centre. Crucial wards in the election were seen as being Sholing and Bitterne Park. Meanwhile, as well as the 3 main parties there were also candidates from the United Kingdom Independence Party, British National Party and the Green Party. Election result The results saw the council remain with no party having a majority, but the Labour party lost 2 seats and the Conservatives gained 2. The Liberal Democrats remained the largest party with 18 seats after gaining Coxford from Labour, but losing Bitterne Park to the Conservatives. The Conservatives grew to 14 seats after also gaining Freemantle from Labour, who thus dropped to 15 seats. The Labour group leader, June Bridle, held her seat in Sholing by 84 votes, with both Labour and the Conservatives saying that the 657 won by the United Kingdom Independence Party had probably enabled Labour to hold on there. Overall turnout in the election increased to 31.6% from 29% in 2003. Following the election Liberal Democrat Adrian Vinson remained as leader of the council, after being confirmed by a vote of 18 to 0 at a council meeting.

An estimated 275 Australians develop diabetes every day. The 2005 Australian AusDiab Follow-up Study (Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study) showed that 1.7 million Australians have diabetes but that up to half of the cases of type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed.  Type 2  Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, and majority of those affected are diagnosed with Type 2. Type 2 diabetes is classified as a lifestyle disease which is impacted by environmental and hereditary factors. This form of diabetes is significantly affected by the lifestyle the individual has. It is associated with the individuals' diet and activity level. The population who are most at risk are those who adopt a sedentary lifestyle at a young age. = Prevention = * Maintaining a healthy weight * Regular physical activity * Managing blood pressure * Managing cholesterol levels * Quit/ Avoid smoking Although there is no direct cure for Type 2 diabetes the Australian Government: Department of Health has put in place guidelines to assure that children and adolescents receive the suggested period of time engaging in physical activity. Some of their suggestions are as follows: * shift from a low to moderate activity level * participate in more vigorous activity rather than moderate intensity exercise- you will save time and therefore have more time for friends and family * avoid long periods of screen time (devices including TV, Phone, etc.) * avoid long sitting sessions  Diabetes facts  Other facts about diabetes include: * Every year 0.8% of adults developed diabetes. * Every day in Australia approximately 275 adults develop diabetes. * Those with pre-diabetes were 10-20 times more likely to develop diabetes than were those with normal blood glucose levels. * Obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, physical inactivity and the metabolic syndrome each increased the risk for developing diabetes.ELM Barr, DJ Magliano, PZ Zimmet, KR Polkinghorne, RC Atkins, DW Dunstan, SG Murray, JE Shaw 2006, AusDiab 2005 The Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study International Diabetes Institute, Melbourne, Australia In 2007-08 approximately 520,000 people had diabetes and CVD meaning only 42% of diabetics did not have CVD. CVD is the major cause of mortality in people suffering from diabetes with CVD accounting for 80% of deaths. The International Diabetes Federation has estimated that currently 194 million people worldwide, or 5.1% within the adult population have diabetes; this will jump to 333 million, or 6.3%, by 2025. Type 2 Diabetes makes up approximately 85% to 95% of all diabetes in developed countries, and is even higher in developing countries. The European Region, with 48 million, and Western Pacific Region, with 43 million, has the most people with diabetes currently. In 2025, the region with the largest number of people with diabetes will change to the South-East Asian Region with approximately 82 million sufferers. Right now the age group with the greatest number of people suffering from diabetes are the 40- to 59-year-olds. Owing to the ageing population, by 2025 there will be 146 million people aged 40‚Äì59 and 147 million people aged 60 or older with diabetes. In 2003, the number of people with diabetes in urban areas was 78 million and by 2025 it is said to increase to 182 million urban and 61 million rural people with diabetes. = Epidemiology = Indigenous Australians A University of Alberta study, conducted in 2006, noted that 60% of Aboriginal people over the age of 35 in Western Australia tested positive for diabetes. Migrant populations A study conducted by the International Diabetes Institute at Monash University showed that Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Middle Eastern immigrants who moved to Australia were diagnosed with diabetes at a higher level than the average. The increase was explained by the adoption of a Western diet in place of a more healthy \\"traditional\\" diet more common in their native countries, as well as adopting a more sedentary lifestyle which is ubiquitous in developed countries. =National Diabetes Services Scheme= The National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) was created in 1987 and is an institution funded by the Australian Government that delivers diabetes-related products at affordable prices and provides information and support services to people with type 1, type 2, gestational and other types of diabetes; the number one national peak body for diabetes in Australia, Diabetes Australia, runs this scheme. State and territory diabetes organisations are also assisting in the arrangements and planning of services for this scheme. The National Diabetes service aim is to ensure appropriate, reliable and affordable access to diabetes-related products and services to support people suffering from diabetes.

From there he moved to ICI, eventually reaching the rank of director. In 1947 he joined the Council of Industrial Design, a body set up by the Board of Trade in 1944. He was chairman of the council from 1953 until 1960, during which time he set up the Design Centre, a permanent exhibition of the council‚Äôs work. The establishment of the Design Centre proved to be a turning point in the history of the council, which until that time had attracted more critics than friends. In 1961 he was appointed to chair a committee to bring in a new era of modern road signage. The committee reported in 1963, advocating a total overhaul of the style of British road signs, introducing a new style that has lasted until the present day. The report recommended the pictorial design found on many European road signs, along with a British-designed font that was to become known as the Transport font.

One or more challenges are featured in each episode, with the work reviewed by a panel of judges who eliminate one or more artists each week until a final winner is chosen. Actress McKenzie Westmore, known for her role as Sheridan Crane on the former NBC/DirecTV soap opera Passions and a member of the Westmore family of makeup artists, serves as the show's host. For each assignment, the contestants' work is individually evaluated by a panel of professional special effects makeup artists who serve as judges. These judges have included television and film makeup artist Glenn Hetrick, Academy Award and Emmy Award-winning makeup artist Ve Neill, creature designer and director Patrick Tatopoulos (seasons 1-3), and creature and concept designer Neville Page (seasons 3-present). Industry figures and artists including Brian Grazer, Kevin Smith, Paul W. S. Anderson, Greg Nicotero, Rick Baker, Doug Jones, Len Wiseman, Gale Anne Hurd and Marcus Nispel have served as guest judges. Face Off premiered January 26, 2011 on Syfy. In August 2017, Syfy aired the first season of spin-off series Face Off: Game Face, which brings back four all-stars from previous Face Off seasons for each episode and pits them head-to-head in three rounds for a chance to win . Format Face Off is presented as a progressive elimination competition between 12 and 16 make-up artists. Each week, the artists face a \\"Spotlight Challenge\\" that tests their artistry and techniques to create a full makeup character to match a theme over the course of 3 days. The first day allows for concept design and sculpting for five hours, a second day of 9¬Ω to 10 hours for work in finishing the molding, and a final day of 4 hours in applying the makeup before a one- hour \\"Last Look\\" for touch ups. The judges then have the opportunity to look at the makeups from afar and up close, and decide a series of top and bottom looks for the week. One artist will be deemed the winner, sometimes receiving a special bonus prize such as immunity from elimination or a cash reward, and one artist will be eliminated from the running for the grand prize. Some episodes also feature a \\"Foundation Challenge\\", a smaller challenge that introduces a new technique on a smaller scale, and the winner is awarded an advantage for that week's Spotlight Challenge, ranging from immunity from elimination to receiving a first choice of theme. More recent seasons have included a \\"Gauntlet\\" challenge, where the artists must complete in three rounds of challenges over two days, with either rounds scored on a point system to determine the winner and loser, or the winners of individual rounds considered safe and do not need to participate in the future rounds. The elimination format proceeds until three or four contestants are left. At this point, they get a larger assignment typically involving makeup for two or more actors for a short film or similar setpiece to feature their work. The judges review the make-up within the context of this final setpiece to determine the winner. The Face Off winner receives 100,000 and a year's supply of makeup from Alcone (changed to 25,000 of makeup in season 2), a \\"grand prize that will launch a career\\". The second season added the 2012 Toyota Camry Hybrid to its prize package. The Season 3 grand prize winner will receive the same US$25,000 of Alcone makeup and US$100,000 cash prize, in addition to the opportunity to become a guest lecturer at the \\"Make up for Ever Academy\\" in New York and Paris, and the Toyota Prius v. The prize package for season 4 remains the same with the exception of the 2013 Fiat 500 replacing the Prius V as the prize vehicle. Production and development Syfy began the development of Face Off in March 2010 in association with the production company Mission Control Media.

He proceeded M.A. in 1625. He was received by John Preston as a pupil as recommended by Puller; when Preston became master of Emmanuel College, he took Ball along with him from Queens'. Ball obtained a fellowship, and had a large group of pupils; his exercises and sermons at St. Mary's gained him distinction as a preacher.

It was the last colliery to be sunk in Astley. Sinking commenced in 1908 by the Pilkington Colliery Company, a subsidiary of the Clifton and Kersley Coal Company, at the southern edge of the Manchester Coalfield, working the Middle Coal Measures where they dipped under the Permian age rocks under Chat Moss. The colliery was north of the Bridgewater Canal. In 1929 it became part of Manchester Collieries, and in 1947 was nationalised and integrated into the National Coal Board. It closed in 1970, and is now Astley Green Colliery Museum. Geology Astley Green is the southernmost colliery on the Manchester Coalfield. It accessed the coal seams of the Middle Coal Measures laid down over 300 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period and overlain by Permo-Triassic rocks. A layer of alluvial deposits consisting of clay, sand, gravel and marl overlay the rock. The coal seams dipped at 1 to 4.5 towards the south. The Worsley Four Foot mine was reached at a depth of and the Arley mine at 3360 feet (1020 m). History The Clifton and Kearsley Company's coal reserves were becoming depleted in the Irwell Valley at a time when demand for coal on the Lancashire Coalfield was at its highest and in 1907 its subsidiary company sank a bore hole at Astley Green, north of the Bridgewater Canal to investigate untapped reserves of the concealed coalfield. The company acquired the mineral rights for of land accessing an estimated 140 million tons of coal under Chat Moss stretching beyond the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and where the coal seams dip at 1 in 4.5 towards the south. Shaft sinking commenced in 1908 and proved difficult because of water and quicksand. The company contracted Haniel and Lueg of D√ºsseldorf-D√ºsseltal to sink the shaft. The Worsley Four Foot mine was reached in April 1910 and more water-bearing rock was anticipated before the Arley mine was reached. No 1 pit was sunk to 890 yards primarily to win coal from the Trencherbone mine and No 2 pit was 833 yards deep. The shaft was 23 feet in diameter. The Crombouke and Rams mines were intersected by the sinkings. Firedamp was a problem in the new workings and ventilation was a problem. The headgear of No.1 pit survives, it is made from wrought iron lattice girders with riveted plates at the joints and one small and two large wheels mounted at the top. It is nearly high and was built by Head Wrightson of Stockton-on-Tees and completed by 1912. In 1912 a twin tandem compound 3300 horsepower winding engine built by Yates and Thom of Blackburn, the largest ever used on the Lancashire Coalfield, was installed at No 1 pit. The company built a smaller cross compound winding engine for No 2 pit, installed in 1919. In 1923 the colliery employed 1524 men underground and 436 surface workers; which increased to 1631 underground and 492 surface workers by 1933. At Nationalisation in 1947 the colliery employed 1375 below and 561 above ground. The surface workers included women, known as pit brow lasses, who sorted coal on the screens. Women were employed at Astley Green until the mid-1950s. Transport By about 1851, George Green had built a horse-drawn tramway linking Yew Tree Colliery to the Bridgewater Canal east of Astley Green. The tramway was out of use by 1913, when its sidings and tipping plant were sold to the Clifton and Kersley Coal Company to be used by the new colliery. A mineral line and exchange sidings to connect with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway east of Astley Station a mile and a half to the south was built across Chat Moss using similar construction methods to the earlier railway, tree trunks and branches overlain with pit waste, to provide a foundation for the rails. An 0-4-0 saddletank, \\"Astley\\", from Pecketts of Bristol was bought in 1908 and used on the construction of the line as was \\"Winnie\\", a contractor's 0-4-0 tank engine hired from Thomas Mitchell and Sons of Bury. When production began in 1912, 0-4-0 locomotive \\"Outwood\\" was transferred from the company's Outwood Colliery and in 1914 an 0-6-0 saddletank \\"Astley Green\\", built in 1880, was bought from a Darlington firm. A new locomotive, \\"Edward\\", a six-coupled saddletank was bought from Hawthorn Leslie in 1916. \\"Black Diamond\\" and \\"Newtown\\" were transferred from other Clifton and Kersley pits in the 1920s. After 1929 the Astley Green was on Manchester Collieries' Central Railway system based on Walkden Yard. Incident There was a mining accident at the colliery on 6 June 1939, when there was an explosion of firedamp. Men had been fighting an underground fire over a mile from the pit bottom. Despite the efforts of the mines rescue teams from Boothstown Mines Rescue Station, who were driven back by further explosions, five men including the manager died.

He was allegedly burnt alive by an oil adulteration mafia at Manmad near Nashik. Later, CBI investigations revealed that he was killed due to past enmity and that Sonawane had demanded bribes from the same mafia. Murder Sonawane had received some information about oil adulteration a week before his death from his sources. While going to Nandgaon for a tehsildar meeting he spotted a few trucks parked in a very suspicious manner near a road side eatery where the depots of IOC, HPCL and BPCL were located. The area was infamous for smuggling and adulteration of petrol, diesel and kerosene. Sonawane got out of the car and started investigating about the trucks. The local police it appears were not informed about this raid. He was accompanied by his personal assistant and another staff member but had no police cover. Sometime later a man named Popat Shinde, who had a reputation of running an oil, petrol and diesel smuggling racket, along with his men attacked the officer, beat him up and then set him on fire. Shinde was detained by police and was taken to the Malegaon Civil Hospital since he also suffered burn injuries. Sonawane was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. In November 2005 a similar mafia killed an IIM graduate Shanmugam Manjunath who was murdered for sealing a corrupt petrol station in UP. Investigation On 26 January 2011, seven persons were arrested for burning to death Yashwant Sonawane and appeared before a local court at Manmad. They were remanded to police custody for two weeks until 8 February. State Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan ordered an inquiry into the incident. He said, \\"the government will not tolerate attacks on the officials and strict action will be taken against those responsible for burning Sonawane.\\" On 27 January 2011, two days after Sonawane was burnt alive, authorities in Maharashtra carried out raids at nearly 200 places, arresting around 180 people in an attempt to crack down on the oil adulteration mafia. ‚ÄúWe learnt with shock about the heinous killing of Additional Collector Yashwant Sonawane.... He died a martyr to the cause of anti-adulteration drive\\", Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy told a news conference in New Delhi on 28 January 2011. Mr. Reddy also said that an improved chemical marker will be doped in kerosene to make its mixing with diesel near impossible. An ex-gratia of Rs. 2.5 million was announced for the family of Sonawane. Meanwhile, Popat Shinde the prime accused, died of a cardiac arrest caused due to sepsis on 31 January 2011 at JJ Hospital in the city. Shinde, who was being treated for burn injuries, died in the afternoon, but no one came forward to claim his body. A twist in the story came when the CBI started investigations. It was revealed that Yashwant Sonawane was in fact already being investigated on charges of accepting bribes and corruption. The CBI report also indicated that both Sonawane and Shinde had a long-standing mutually beneficial relationship. Things turned sour when Sonawane's demands for bribes increased.

It runs through the states of Salzburg and Tyrol (North Tyrol) from the city of Salzburg to W√∂rgl and belongs to the core network (Kernnetz) of the Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB). The section between Salzburg and Schwarzach-Sankt Veit is part of the Salzburg S-Bahn urban railway network.  Course  The standard gauge line runs along the Salzach valley, the Bischofshofen hub being of particular importance as the junction with the Enns Valley Railway to Selzthal in Styria. At the W√∂rgl terminus, the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway meets the Lower Inn Valley Railway running from the Tyrolean capital Innsbruck to the German border at Kufstein and the Deutsches Eck transport link. The line has been upgraded to double track throughout and both tracks may be worked in bi-directional running. The entire route is electrified and is powered by 15,000 Volt alternating current and a frequency of 16.7 Hertz. In particular the S-train section from Salzburg Hauptbahnhof to the southern branch-off of the Tauern Railway line at Schwarzach-St. Veit was given a major upgrade and, in places, entirely rebuilt and re-routed.  Names  It is (and wasVolkswirthschaftliche Zeitung. (Giselabahn.) Das Vaterland, 15. November 1872 ) also known as the Gisela Railway (Giselabahn), after Archduchess Gisela of Austria, the second daughter of Emperor Franz Joseph I and his wife Elisabeth. Today it is frequently considered to be a continuation of the Western Railway from Vienna to Salzburg; the whole railway line from Wien Westbahnhof to Salzburg and W√∂rgl is also referred to as Empress Elisabeth Railway (Kaiserin-Elisabeth-Bahn). The westernmost Zell am See‚ÄìW√∂rgl section in Tyrol is also called Brixental Railway.  History  W√∂rgl Station, about 1900 The Salzburg-Tyrol Railway was built from 1873 to 1875 on the basis of the \\"Concession Authority dated 10 November 1872 for the Limited Company of the Privileged Empress Elisabeth Railway for the Construction and Operation of a Locomotive Railway Running from Upper Styria to Salzburg and North Tyrol\\".R. G. Bl. No. 170/1872Volkswirthschaftliche Zeitung. (Giselabahn.) Das Vaterland, 31 December 1872 It runs from Salzburg via Hallein, Bischofshofen, St. Johann im Pongau, Schwarzach-St. Veit, Zell am See, Hochfilzen, St. Johann in Tirol and Kitzb√ºhel to W√∂rgl. The north ramp of the Tauern Railway, from Schwarzach- Sankt Veit station on the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway up to Bad Gastein, opened on 20 September 1905. The southern continuation across the main chain of the Alps to Spittal in the Drava Valley, including the Tauern Railway Tunnel, was inaugurated by Emperor Franz Joseph on 5 July 1909. By 1915 the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway was upgraded to double track and, in 1925, electrification of the line began, finished in 1930. Towards the end of World War II, the railway became a target for Allied bombing due to its strategic importance.  Operation  √ñBB EuroCity train near Pfarrwerfen. Bombardier Talent railcar near Brixen im Thale Up to today, the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway is the only east‚Äìwest railway link to Tyrol that runs entirely on Austrian territory. The fact that there is no parallel motorway link on national territory gave the line great importance, especially before Austria's accession to the EU in 1995. However, its significance is increasingly on the wane, partly because it has the characteristics of an Alpine railway with steep hills and tight curves, hence high-speed rail transport is not possible. Austrian east-west trains therefore usually use the route from Salzburg via Rosenheim station in Germany to Innsbruck, transiting the Deutsches Eck link. The line is important, though, especially for regional services, as part of the connexion from Innsbruck to the state capitals Klagenfurt and Graz as well as part of the line from Salzburg to Graz (via the Enns Valley Railway). In addition, the only Austrian coach transport service from North Tyrol to Lienz in East Tyrol leaves from Kitzb√ºhel station on the Salzburg-Tyrol Railway. The line is also fairly important as an alternative route for international rail traffic on the east‚Äìwest axis, but it is more significant as a feeder for the Tauern Railway crossing the Hohe Tauern range of the Central Eastern Alps from north to south. The Salzburg-Tyrol Railway is also used by sleeping car trains. The night train from Bregenz to Vienna used to run on this line until December 2008, in order to achieve journey times that enabled passengers to spend enough time in the sleepers and to save the rail tolls charged by German Deutsche Bahn railway company for using the Deutsches Eck transport link. The railway is also important for local services in the central region of Salzburg and in North Tyrol. Between Salzburg Hauptbahnhof and Golling-Abtenau the line is worked every half-an-hour and from Golling to Schwarzach every hour by the S3 line of the Salzburg S-Bahn network. The section from W√∂rgl to Saalfelden is served by the S6 line of Tyrol S-Bahn system.

He invented the StreetLogic artificial intelligence technology used for the Fleat Network, and is the designer of a lightweight personal flotation device that won Best of Show for technical apparel at ICAST, the world's largest sportfishing trade show. He is known as an advocate for independent arts, and regularly promotes up-and-coming artists through the marketing programs of the companies he operates. As an artist, Beach is known for using \\"natural elements\\", \\"nature's rhythms\\", and \\"water as art\\".  Career  = Musician = In 1992 Beach was a founding member of the surf-rock band Lo Presher based in Central Florida. Lo Presher recorded three albums and toured the surf industry circuit with a rhythmic act that featured homemade percussive instruments made from alligator skulls, turtle shells and bamboo. The New York Times described the band‚Äôs music as ‚Äúwooden drums and didgeridoo added to hard-rock and punk‚Äù. In 1996 Lo Presher approached Warped Tour founder Kevin Lyman with a proposal to organize an independent artist stage which became known as the Surf Compound. The band went on to manage, produce and perform on this independent stage through their own indie record label, EVREC Productions, from 1996 to 1999. = Designer/inventor =  Bluworld of Water  In 1998 Beach used profits from tours and album sales as capital to launch a concept that combined his love for water and art. Bluworld of Water, started by Beach and his brother Sean Drummond, has grown into the largest commercial and residential indoor water feature company in the world. Beach served as the creative force behind the brand until 2005, and has been referred to as the world's foremost authority on water art and design. Beach and Drummond were featured on CNBC‚Äôs The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch in 2008 to discuss the rapid success of Bluworld. Beach pioneered the concept of ‚Äúwater as art‚Äù, selling water sculptures. The company partnered on a furniture line with renowned spokesmodel and design entrepreneur Kathy Ireland. In 2003 Beach was commissioned by Fiji Water to design an installation for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week (New York Fashion Week) at Bryant Park in Manhattan, NY. The lifestyle magazine Robb Report labeled Beach as \\"one of the country's leading water artists,\\"  Bong Spirit Vodka  Beach‚Äôs experience as a nightclub designer and owner inspired him to develop a brand concept for a line of distilled spirits, which resulted in the creation of Bong Spirit Vodka. Beach chose the controversial bottle design based on its symbolism as a communal object, and the cultural role it has represented for decades as an underground icon in the arts and entertainment community. Beach debuted Bong Spirit in December 2005 at Art Basel in Miami Beach and created a marketing program called Spirit of the Brand that allows up-and-coming artists the opportunity to design artwork for the company's bottles. Bong Spirit uses proceeds from the art bottles to promote indie arts by organizing regional exhibitions, concerts, and bottle signing events. In 2007 Beach selected the top finalists from hundreds of design submissions from around the world and debuted the winning bottle designs at an exhibition in Austin, Texas featuring art from such recognized street artists as Shepard Fairy, Aidan Hughes, Istvan Orosz, Vulcan, and Art Spiegelman. In 2008 Bong Spirit Vodka was launched in select international party destinations such as Ho Chi Minh City, London and Macau. Beach has won several design awards for the bottle concept, innovative marketing programs and designer accessories for Bong Spirit Imports In 2010 Beach won the Platinum Medal at the Spirits International Prestige for the best overall package design out of 162 brands submitted from around the world. On September 22, 2010 Bong Spirit Imports, LLC was acquired by Millennium Prime, Inc (OTC: MLMN), and currently operates as a subsidiary of the company. Millennium Prime is a developer, acquirer and marketer of lifestyle brands and enters lifestyle product markets to establish business units focused on brand categories.  Talent Database  In 2007 Beach launched the Global Talent Database, a free talent search engine and artist directory, similar to a global Yellow Pages for talent and creativity. The network‚Äôs servers suffered a catastrophic failure from a cooling system malfunction in 2009, rendering the project unrecoverable and in need of a rebuild that is said to be planned for the near future.http://www.talentdatabase.com/ Beach was the editor and author of Talent Speaks, an artist blog centered around \\"a discussion of advancements in technology and the subsequent increased amount of opportunities for self-employed and independent artists.\\"  Lifeshirt  In June 2015 Beach announced the development of an inflatable life jacket-type device designed to achieve a Level 50 performance rating established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Beach cited the purpose for the invention is due to the fact people are not regularly wearing the current bulky PFDs and loss of life due to drowning can be directly attributed to this fact. In July 2015, Lifeshirt won the Best of Show Award for technical apparel at ICAST, the world's largest sportfishing tradeshow. Lifeshirt was selected for the top award among a field of 889 products submitted by 270 companies. = Producer =  The Surf Compound  From 1996 to 1998 Beach co-produced the ‚ÄúSurf Compound‚Äù on the Vans Warped Tour, which provided a platform for prominent action sports athletes and musicians such as Tom Curren, Donavon Frankenreiter, Kelly Slater, Mark McGrath, Peter King, and Ray Bones.  Rhythm of Nature  In 2003 Beach wrote and directed Rhythm of Nature, a theatrical production featuring percussion instruments and tribal rhythms with Cirque du Soleil performers personifying the notions of water, rhythm and dance.  Bandwagon Roadshow  In 2010 Beach launched the Bandwagon Roadshow, a concert festival series combining national interest in car culture and popular music. Bandwagon was named ‚ÄúBest New Event Launch of 2010‚Äù by BizBash Magazine. In September 2010, Beach started an internet-based radio station called RadioBandwagon that serves as the centerpiece for the series‚Äô promotional marketing, and features more than a dozen themed radio shows that support the car culture lifestyle. In 2011 Beach signed a broadcast deal with Fox Entertainment for a TV show entitled \\"Bandwagon: The American Roadshow\\", a release date has yet to be set.

The class was established in 1917, under the name Psilophyta, with only three genera (Rhynia, Horneophyton and Psilophyton) for a group of fossil plants from the Upper Silurian and Devonian periods which lack true roots and leaves, but have a vascular system within a branching cylindrical stem. The living Psilotaceae, the whisk-ferns, were sometimes added to the class, which was then usually called Psilopsida. This classification is no longer in use., p. 226 The class should not be confused with the current use of the name Psilotopsida, which refers to a class of living ferns, containing only Psilotaceae (whisk-ferns) and Ophioglossaceae (moon-worts and adder's-tongue ferns). Description The class was created in 1917 by Kidston and Lang for fossils found in the Rhynie Chert Bed., cited in Three genera were initially included, Rhynia, Horneophyton and Psilophyton. All lacked leaves and true roots, consisting only of branched stems; however they were considered to contain vascular tissue. Additional fossil genera were added later.

It was split up by Banks into three subdivisions: Rhyniophytina, Zosterophyllophytina, and Trimerophytina. Later cladistic analyses of early land plants suggested that at least the rhyniophytes and the trimerophytes were not monophyletic. Separating out 'basal groups', such as the earliest land plants, is intrinsically difficult, since at this stage they contain many shared characters (plesiomorphies) which are not sufficient to distinguish them. The current classification of former members of the class is largely due to Kenrick and Crane in 1997.

The first church in this location is said to have been established by St Deiniol Fab (to whom the church is dedicated) in 616. He was the son of St Deiniol, the first Bishop of Bangor. The current building, which is in Early English style, incorporates some material and fittings from an earlier church on the site, including the font and an 18th-century memorial in the porch. The vestry door has medieval jambs and the keystone of its arch, which is also medieval, is a carved human face. Some parts of the nave walls may also come from a previous building here. The church is no longer used for worship, and the village is now served by a church in Llanfairpwll. As of 2011, the building (without the surrounding grounds) was for sale. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church\\". History and location St Deiniol's Church is near the centre of Llanddaniel Fab, a village in the south of Anglesey, north Wales. It is reached from the street by passing through a lychgate by the local war memorial. The village takes its name from the church; the Welsh word ' originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and -ddaniel is a modified form of the saint's name. The date of first construction of a Christian place of worship in the area is uncertain, but it is said by 19th-century writers that a son of St Deiniol (the first Bishop of Bangor) established a church here in 616. The son, also a saint, was known as Deiniol Fab (Welsh for \\"Deiniol the son\\"), to distinguish him from his father. No part of a building from that time survives. A later edifice, dating from the 16th century or perhaps earlier, was replaced in the 19th century. Some parts of that structure may have been reused in the current church, as the 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire considered that sections of the walls of the nave may be from the older building. In 1833, the antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the old church as \\"a very ancient and dilapidated structure\\", which had \\"some good specimens of the architecture of a very remote period\\". Writing in 1846, the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones described it as one \\"so much altered by successive reparations, that little of its original architectural character has been preserved\\". Repairs were carried out to the new church, and a vestry added to the north side, in 1873. The work was overseen by Henry Kennedy, architect of the Diocese of Bangor. St Deiniol's is no longer in use; in 2006, a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that no services had been held for a number of years, and added that ivy was growing across the building. The church's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of Llanfairpwll, served by St Mary's, Llanfairpwll. As of January 2011, the church (without the grounds) was on sale for ¬£50,000; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that it could be used as a studio or for storage, subject to necessary consents being obtained. People associated with St Deiniol's include the clergymen Henry Rowlands and Isaac Jones. Rowlands, who wrote a history of Anglesey (Mona Antiqua Restaurata) in 1723, served as priest here and in nearby parishes from 1696 onwards. Jones, a translator, was curate of St Deiniol's from 1840 until his death in 1850. Architecture and fittings The Gothic Revival church is in the Early English style. It is built from rubble masonry dressed with limestone and has a slate roof. The vestry is partially built from material used in the old church. The door in the vestry's north wall has medieval doorjambs, and the keystone of the pointed arch, which is also medieval, is a carved human face. The nave of the church (where the congregation sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at the east end of the nave. There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, on the south side of the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save for one to the west of the porch, which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle. Internally, the walls have panelling at the bottom and painted plasterwork above. The roof has exposed timbers. There is a pointed chancel arch and three steps between the nave and chancel, with a further step to the sanctuary, which has a mosaic floor. The east windows and those on the north have stained glass. Fittings include the rectangular pulpit, the pews, and the altar table, which are all made of pine wood, and the octagonal font, made of granite with carvings on each side. The 1937 Royal Commission survey recorded that the church owned a plain silver cup, dated 1796‚Äì1797. A visual inspection of the church in 2006 determined that there were many cobwebs inside, but also that the pews and organ remained in place. Assessment St Deiniol's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is regarded as \\"a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church\\". Cadw (the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) states that it is \\"coherently designed in an early Gothic style which is apt for its scale\\".

In the Arrow‚ÄìDebreu model of general economic equilibrium, agents have convex budget sets and convex preferences: At equilibrium prices, the budget hyperplane supports the best attainable indifference curve. The profit function is the convex conjugate of the cost function. Convex analysis is the standard tool for analyzing textbook economics. Non‚Äëconvex phenomena in economics have been studied with nonsmooth analysis, which generalizes convex analysis. Preliminaries The economics depends upon the following definitions and results from convex geometry. =Real vector spaces= A real vector space of two dimensions may be given a Cartesian coordinate system in which every point is identified by a list of two real numbers, called \\"coordinates\\", which are conventionally denoted by x and y. Two points in the Cartesian plane can be added coordinate-wise : (x1, y1) + (x2, y2) = (x1+x2, y1+y2); further, a point can be multiplied by each real number Œª coordinate-wise : Œª (x, y) = (Œªx, Œªy). More generally, any real vector space of (finite) dimension D can be viewed as the set of all possible lists of D real numbers } together with two operations: vector addition and multiplication by a real number. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, the operations of vector addition and real-number multiplication can each be defined coordinate-wise, following the example of the Cartesian plane. =Convex sets= In the convex hull of the red set, each blue point is a convex combination of some red points. In a real vector space, a set is defined to be convex if, for each pair of its points, every point on the line segment that joins them is covered by the set. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non‚Äëconvex. Trivially, the empty set is convex. More formally, a set Q is convex if, for all points v0 and v1 in Q and for every real number Œª in the unit interval , the point : (1 ‚àí Œª) v0 \\\\+ Œªv1 is a member of Q. By mathematical induction, a set Q is convex if and only if every convex combination of members of Q also belongs to Q. By definition, a convex combination of an indexed subset {v0, v1, . . . , vD} of a vector space is any weighted average for some indexed set of non‚Äënegative real numbers {Œªd} satisfying the equation = 1\\\\. The definition of a convex set implies that the intersection of two convex sets is a convex set. More generally, the intersection of a family of convex sets is a convex set. =Convex hull= For every subset Q of a real vector space, its is the minimal convex set that contains Q. Thus Conv(Q) is the intersection of all the convex sets that cover Q. The convex hull of a set can be equivalently defined to be the set of all convex combinations of points in Q. Duality: Intersecting half-spaces A convex set S (in pink), a supporting hyperplane of S (the dashed line), and the half-space delimited by the hyperplane that contains S (in light blue). Supporting hyperplane is a concept in geometry. A hyperplane divides a space into two half-spaces. A hyperplane is said to support a set S in the real n-space \\\\mathbb R^n if it meets both of the following: * S is entirely contained in one of the two closed half-spaces determined by the hyperplane * S has at least one point on the hyperplane. Here, a closed half-space is the half-space that includes the hyperplane. =Supporting hyperplane theorem= A convex set can have more than one supporting hyperplane at a given point on its boundary. This theorem states that if S is a closed convex set in \\\\mathbb R^n, and x is a point on the boundary of S, then there exists a supporting hyperplane containing x. The hyperplane in the theorem may not be unique, as noticed in the second picture on the right. If the closed set S is not convex, the statement of the theorem is not true at all points on the boundary of S, as illustrated in the third picture on the right. A supporting hyperplane containing a given point on the boundary of S may not exist if S is not convex. =Economics= The consumer prefers the vector of goods (Qx, Qy) over other affordable vectors. At this optimal vector, the budget line supports the indifference curve I2. An optimal basket of goods occurs where the consumer's convex preference set is supported by the budget constraint, as shown in the diagram. If the preference set is convex, then the consumer's set of optimal decisions is a convex set, for example, a unique optimal basket (or even a line segment of optimal baskets). For simplicity, we shall assume that the preferences of a consumer can be described by a utility function that is a continuous function, which implies that the preference sets are closed. (The meanings of \\"closed set\\" is explained below, in the subsection on optimization applications.) Non‚Äëconvexity When consumer preferences have concavities, then the linear budgets need not support equilibria: Consumers can jump between allocations. If a preference set is non‚Äëconvex, then some prices produce a budget supporting two different optimal consumption decisions. For example, we can imagine that, for zoos, a lion costs as much as an eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle.

The festival honors the local patron saints the Black Christ of Esquipulas, Saint Anthony Abbot, and Saint Sebastian. It is claimed locally that, like many of the Catholic festivals in Latin America, it has its roots in the much older indigenous culture. So it has developed into a hybrid of old indigenous culture and newer Catholic and Spanish cultures. The church where the festival concludes is home to an old tree which, according to residents, predates the church. This tree is said to represent the \\"tree of life\\" (drawing on Maya and other pre-Hispanic American cultures), which would suggest that this site was used for ceremonies before the arrival of Catholicism. The festivities, which include Roman Catholic religious ceremonies, music, dancing, and local cuisine, were included in UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists on November 16, 2010, listed as \\"Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo\\".  History  Parachico celebrations in 1948 Parachico celebrations in 2020 Although the Grand Fiesta of the Parachicos has pre-Hispanic origins, the tradition dates to the seventeenth century, when the image of San Sebastian, Martyr, arrived in what was then known as the Royal Village of Chiapa (or Chiapa of the Indians), and the church was built. There are many versions of the history of the Parachicos, but all the stories say that one day a beautiful woman arrived seeking a cure for her sick son. She had taken him to visit doctor and healers, but all failed to alleviate his suffering. Someone told her to go to Chiapa de Corzo, where surely she would find a cure, so she moved there with all her servants, and there her son was finally healed. When she realized that the village was one of humble people, she tried to reward them by distributing food. Meanwhile, the natives danced around the boy‚Äîpainted and disguised to look white like his mother, so the little one would not be scared. When the lady, whose name was Se√±ora Maria de Angulo, gave the gifts to the dancers, she said: \\"for the boy,\\" or \\"para el chico,\\" shortened to\\"Parachico.\\" Oral tradition also offers another version. It is said that in the middle of the 18th century a Spanish lady from Guatemala arrived in Chiapa de Corzo who had a sick son whom the doctors had not been able to cure. She had arrived in Chiapa de Corzo with her son and a large number of servants because she wanted to consult a famed Indian healer and went to visit him. \\"Clear the way for my lady Mar√≠a de Angulo!\\" shouted her servants. The healer recommended that the rich Spanish woman take her sick son to the healing waters of Cumbujuy√∫ and bathe him for nine days. This done, the boy healed, and she returned to Guatemala happy. In the years 1767 and 1768, a plague of locusts destroyed the crops of Chiapa and the population suffered famine. After this calamity, an epidemic broke out that killed almost half of its population. Amidst this misery, there arrived at Chiapa de Corzo a mule train loaded with large stores of corn, beans, vegetables, and money. The people could not believe it until they heard again the voices of the servants: \\"Clear the way for my lady Mar√≠a de Angulo!\\" The servants distributed the food to the families, and during the nights the servants and danced and danced for the amusement of the children. They also threw candy to them and warned their parents, \\"Remember your children, the gifts are for the children!\\" All this was done in memory of the son of Mar√≠a de Angulo, or \\"para el chico.\\" Thus the tradition of the Parachicos was born. Each year, the city celebrates this event with a woman dressed as Se√±ora Maria de Angulo, who travels aboard an allegorical car, throwing gold coins, sweets, and confetti. On certain nights during the festival, the town's men dress as Spanish women and parade through the streets. This is explained as a way of honoring Se√±ora Maria de Angulo. Attire Parachico mask.Parachicos wear wooden masks with Caucasian features, such as light skin, facial hair and blue eyes, in contrast to Native people's features. They also wear a round headdress, colorful ribbons, striped serapes, embroidered shawls, usually over black or dark shirt and trousers. Parachicos use metallic rattles locally known as chinchin or chinchines, with colorful ribbons attached to the top and/or handles, which are shaken as they dance and chant.  Declaration as Intangible Cultural Heritage  UNESCO declared plate as intangible cultural heritage On November 16, 2010, the Festival of the Parachicos was declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO.

The technique was developed by HSA Engineers & Scientists in Fort Myers, Florida in 2002, led by Richard Lewis, Steven Folsom, and Brian Moore. It is being used all over the United States, and has been adopted by the state of Florida in its Dry-cleaning Solvent Cleanup Program.2007 EBJ Business Achievement Awards ‚Äì Winners, Environmental Business Journal Process MAGS involves the extraction and analysis of soil vapor from a piezometer screened through the unsaturated soil column for the purpose of locating unsaturated zone source material. According to the MAGS Manual, written by HSA and adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, MAGS is performed \\"by utilizing a typical regenerative blower fitted to a temporary soil vapor extraction well, [such that]a large volume of soil can be assessed with a limited number of samples. While lacking the resolution of traditional soil sampling methods (e.g., discrete soil sampling, low flow active gas sampling, etc.), the statistical representativeness (in the sense of sample coverage) of MAGS results versus traditional methods is much greater. Moreover, the results of the assessment provide useful transport and exposure assessment information over traditional techniques. Lastly, MAGS is effective as both an initial site assessment and remedial assessment tool, in that, MAGS directly yields data required for remedial design.\\"Modified Active Gas Sampling Manual, Florida Department of Environmental Protection Advantages MAGS is an alternative to discrete and composite soil sampling. MAGS, while it does not describe the sample with as much precision as the previously mentioned sampling methods, is more powerful statistically: it represents a larger area of a site which is more useful in determining the presence of a compound. Besides increasing the accuracy in identifying the presence compounds in the soil, MAGS also can quickly and accurately narrow down the location and spread of the compounds after a few trials. Once the location has been determined, more thorough and traditional soil borings can be done in the identified location, instead of sampling a whole site.Broward Environmental Remediation Times, November/December 2002 HSA found particular success using the technique at solvent-impacted sites that were showing signs of rebound after initial remediation efforts. These rebounds are commonly the result of multiple (relatively small) release areas that had not been previously discovered with discrete soil sampling. MAGS can be useful in detecting how effectively the site had been cleaned up post- remediation.\\"Poison Detective,\\" Gulf Coast Business Review, 2009 December 4 Branding HSA Engineers & Scientists considered patenting MAGS technology, but decided to trademark MAGS instead, asking that those who use the technique credit the firm. Recognition In 2009, HSA was recognized by the Environmental Business Journal with a Technology Merit Award in the category of remediation for the invention of MAGS technology.

Luthar's programmatic work on HAS youth has now brought national recognition, in major policy reports, that this group is among those at heightened risk for adjustment difficulties. In a 2018 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation report on Adolescent Wellness, environments listed as compromising youth well-being included exposure to poverty, trauma, and discrimination as well as excessive pressures to achieve, usually seen in affluent communities. In a 2019 report by the National Academies of Science, Education, and Medicine, youth in HASs were again listed among those especially vulnerable along with children in deep poverty, those in the foster care system, and those with incarcerated parents. In considering factors that promote resilience among highly pressured youth, Luthar's research pointed to the protective effects of close, supportive relationships with parents (especially mothers who are generally primary caregivers), and appropriate and consistent limit-setting by parents, particularly with regard to misuse of drugs and alcohol.Luthar, S.S., \\"The problem with rich kids\\", Psychology Today, Nov-Dec 2013, 62-69.

Dhammaloka was ordained in Burma prior to 1900, making him one of the earliest attested western Buddhist monks in modern times. He was a celebrity preacher, vigorous polemicist and prolific editor in Burma and Singapore between 1900 and his conviction for sedition and appeal in 1910‚Äì1911. Drawing on western atheist writings, he publicly challenged the role of Christian missionaries and by implication the British empire. Buddhist Tract Society stationery. Early life Dhammaloka's was born in Monkstown, County Dublin in 1856 and given the name Laurence Carroll. He reportedly gave at least five names for himself including Laurence Carroll, Laurence O'Rourke and William Colvin. On occasion he used the nom de plume \\"Captain Daylight\\". It is accepted that he was Irish, almost certainly born in Dublin in the 1850s, and emigrated to the United States, possibly via Liverpool. He then worked his way across the US as a migrant worker before finding work on a trans-Pacific liner. Leaving the ship in Japan, he made his way to Rangoon, arriving probably in the late 1870s or early 1880s, before the final conquest of Upper Burma by the British. Burmese career In Burma, he found work in Rangoon as a tally clerk in a logging firm before becoming interested in the Burmese Buddhism he saw practised all around him. Around 1884, he took ordination as a novice monk under the name Dhammaloka. Fully ordained sometime prior to 1899, he began work as a teacher (probably in the Tavoy monastery in Rangoon). By 1900, he had gained the status of a senior monk in that monastery and began travelling and preaching throughout Burma, becoming known as the \\"Irish pongyi\\" or \\"Irish Buddhist\\".British forces enter Mandalay in 1885 marking the final conquest of Burma. In 1900, Dhammaloka began his public career with two largely unnoticed advertisements forbidding Christian missionaries to distribute tracts and a more dramatic ‚Äì and widely reprinted ‚Äì declaration, first published in Akyab, warning Buddhists of the threats Christian missionaries posed to their religion and culture. Following a 1901 preaching tour, he confronted an off-duty British Indian police officer at the Shwedagon pagoda in Rangoon in 1902 over the wearing of shoes ‚Äì a contentious issue in Burma as Burmese Buddhists would not wear shoes on pagoda grounds. The Indians who staffed the police force equally went barefoot in Indian religious buildings, but off-duty visited Burmese pagodas in boots, in what was interpreted as a mark of serious disrespect. Attempts by the officer and the British authorities to bring sedition charges against Dhammaloka and to get pagoda authorities to repudiate him failed, boosting his public reputation. Later that year he held another preaching tour, which drew huge crowds. After some years' absence Dhammaloka returned to Burma in 1907, establishing the Buddhist Tract Society (see below). In December a reception in his honour was held in Mandalay with hundreds of monks and he met the new Thathanabaing, the government recognised head of the sangha; in early 1908 he held another preaching tour, and continued preaching until at least 1910 and his trial for sedition (see below). Other Asian projects and travels =Singapore= Outside of Burma, Dhammaloka's main base was Singapore and other Straits Settlements (Penang, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh). In Singapore, he stayed initially with a Japanese Buddhist missionary Rev. Ocha before establishing his own mission and free school on Havelock Road in 1903, supported mainly by the Chinese community and a prominent local Sri Lankan jeweller. By 1904 he was sending Europeans to Rangoon for ordination (April) and holding a public novice ordination of the Englishman M. T. de la Courneuve (October). In 1905 the editor of the previously sympathetic Straits Times, Edward Alexander Morphy (originally from Killarney, Ireland), denounced him in the paper as a 'fraud'. Possibly Dhammaloka was not a 'fraud', but Morphy may have been of the opinion that a single novice monk cannot ordain. This is incorrect. A novice monk can ordain someone else -- 'singlehandedly' -- though not to a higher degree as his own. =Japan= Dhammaloka unexpectedly left Burma in 1902, probably hoping to attend the 'World's Parliament of Religions' rumoured to be taking place in Japan. Though no Parliament took place, Japanese sources attest that in September 1902 Dhammaloka attended the launch of the International Young Men's Buddhist Association (IYMBA, Bankoku bukky≈ç seinen reng≈çkai) at Takanawa Buddhist University, Tokyo. He was the only non- Japanese speaker among a group of prominent J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ Buddhist clerics and intellectuals including Shimaji Mokurai. Dhammaloka's presence at an October 'student conference' at the same university in company with the elderly Irish- Australian Theosophist Letitia Jephson is also described by American author Gertrude Adams Fisher in her 1906 travel book A Woman Alone in the Heart of Japan. =Siam= From February to September 1903 Dhammaloka was based at Wat Bantawai in Bangkok, where he founded a free multiracial English-language school, promoted Buddhist associations and proposed an IYMBA-style world congress of Buddhists. He was again reported in Siam in 1914 and may have died there. =Other locations= Dhammaloka is also recorded as having significant links in China and Ceylon (in both of which he published tracts.) There are plausible newspaper reports of his visits to Nepal in 1905 and Australia (1912) and Cambodia (1913). Dhammaloka's claim to have travelled to Tibet well before Younghusband's expedition of 1904, though reported as far afield as Atlanta and Dublin, remains unconfirmed. Publications Dhammaloka produced a large amount of published material, some of which, as was common for the day, consisted of reprints or edited versions of writing by other authors, mostly western atheists or freethinkers, some of whom returned the favour in kind. In the early 1900s Dhammaloka published and reprinted a number of individual tracts attacking Christian missionaries or outlining Buddhist ideas. In 1907 he founded the Buddhist Tract Society in Rangoon, which produced a large number of tracts of this nature. It was originally intended to produce ten thousand copies of each of a hundred tracts; while it is not clear if it reached this number of titles, print runs were very large. To date copies or indications have been found of at least nine different titles, including Thomas Paine's Rights of Man and Age of Reason, Sophia Egoroff's Buddhism: the highest religion, George W Brown's The teachings of Jesus not adapted to modern civilisation, William E Coleman's The Bible God disproved by nature, and a summary of Robert Blatchford. Beyond this, Dhammaloka was an active newspaper correspondent, producing a large number of reports of his own activities for journals in Burma and Singapore (sometimes pseudonymously; Turner 2010: 155) and exchanging letters with atheist journals in America and Britain. He was also a frequent topic of comment by the local press in South and Southeast Asia, by missionary and atheist authors, and by travel writers such as Harry Franck (1910). Controversy Dhammaloka's position was inherently controversial. As a Buddhist preacher he seems to have deferred to Burmese monks for their superior knowledge of Buddhism and instead spoken primarily of the threat of missionaries, whom he identified as coming with \\"a bottle of 'Guiding Star brandy', a 'Holy bible' or 'Gatling gun',\\" linking alcoholism, Christianity and British military power. Unsurprisingly responses to Dhammaloka were divided. In Burma he received support from traditionalists (he was granted a meeting with the Thathanabaing, was treated with respect among senior Burmese monks and a dinner was sponsored in his honour), from rural Burmese (who attended his preaching in large numbers, sometimes travelling several days to hear him; in at least one case women laid down their hair for him to walk on as a gesture of great respect) and from urban nationalists (who organised his preaching tours, defended him in court etc.; Turner 2010). Anecdotal evidence also indicates his broader popularity in neighbouring countries. While also popular in Singapore, particularly among the Chinese community, Bocking's research has shown that he was less successful in Japan and in Siam. Conversely much European opinion was hostile, including naturally that of missionaries and the authorities, but also some journalists (although others did appreciate him and printed his articles as written). In general he was accused of hostility to Christianity, of not being a gentleman or well-educated, and of stirring up \\"the natives.\\" Trial and disappearance Dhammaloka faced at least two encounters with the colonial legal system in Burma, in one and probably both of which he received minor convictions. Turner speculates that this was to avoid the potential political embarrassment to the colonial authorities of trials with more substantial charges and hence a greater burden of proof. During the shoe affair in 1902 it was alleged that Dhammaloka had said \\"we [the West] had first of all taken Burma from the Burmans and now we desired to trample on their religion\\" ‚Äì an inflammatory statement taken as hostile to the colonial state and to assumptions of European social superiority. Following a failed attempt by the government to gather sufficient witnesses for a charge of sedition, a lesser charge of insult was made and it appears that Dhammaloka was summarily convicted on a charge of insult although the sentence is not known. In October and November 1910, Dhammaloka preached in Moulmein, leading to new charges of sedition laid at the instigation of local missionaries. Witnesses testified that he had described missionaries as carrying the Bible, whiskey and weapons, and accused Christians of being immoral, violent and set on the destruction of Burmese tradition. Rather than a full sedition charge, the crown opted to prosecute through a lesser aspect of the law (section 108b) geared to the prevention of future seditious speech, which required a lower burden of proof and entailed a summary hearing. He was bound over to keep the peace and ordered to find two supporters to guarantee this with a bond of 1000 rupees each. This trial was significant for a number of reasons. It was one of the few times the sedition law (designed to prevent native Indian and Burmese journalists from criticising the authorities) was used against a European, the first time it was applied in Burma and precedent-setting for its use against nationalists. On appeal, he was defended by the leading Burmese nationalist U Chit Hlaing, future president of the Young Men's Buddhist Association. The judge in the appeal, who upheld the original conviction, was Mr Justice Daniel H. R. Twomey (knighted in 1917), who wrote the definitive text on dovetailing Buddhist canon law and British colonial law and is of interest to scholars of religion as the grandfather of anthropologist Mary Douglas. Following the failure of his appeal, Dhammaloka's activities become harder to trace. In April 1912, a letter appeared in The Times of Ceylon. Reprinted in Calcutta and Bangkok, the letter purported to report his death in a temperance hotel in Melbourne, Australia. In June of the same year, however, he appeared in the offices of the Singapore Free Press to deny the report, whose motivation remains unclear. Between 1912 and 1913 Dhammaloka is known to have travelled in Australia (reportedly attending the 1912 annual Easter meeting of the I.O.G.T. temperance organisation in Brisbane), the Straits Settlements, Siam and Cambodia; in 1914 a missionary reported him alive in Bangkok running the \\"Siam Buddhist Freethought Association\\". Although, to date, no reliable record of his death has been found, it would not necessarily have been reported during the First World War, if it had taken place while travelling, or indeed if he had been given a traditional monastic funeral in a country such as Siam or Cambodia. Influence and assessment Dhammaloka has been largely forgotten by subsequent Buddhist history, with the exception of brief asides based on a 1904 newspaper item. On the western side, most accounts of early western Buddhists derive ultimately from Ananda Metteyya's followers, whose Buddhist Society of Great Britain and Ireland was key to the formation of early British Buddhism. These accounts do not mention Dhammaloka, but construct a genealogy starting with Bhikkhus Asoka (H. Gordon Douglas), Ananda Metteyya (Allan Bennett) and Nyanatiloka (Anton Gueth). By contrast with Dhammaloka, Ananda Metteyya was oriented toward the image of gentleman scholar, avoided conflict with Christianity and aimed at making western converts rather than supporting Burmese and other Asian Buddhists. Dhammaloka's pugnacious Buddhist revivalism and intensive Asian Buddhist networking, by contrast, places him more beside figures such as Henry Steel Olcott and Anagarika Dharmapala. On the Burmese side, Dhammaloka takes up an intermediate place between traditionalist orientations towards simple restoration of the monarchy and the more straightforward nationalism of the later independence movement. His non-Burmese origins are inconvenient for later nationalist orthodoxy. Dhammaloka's identification of Buddhism with free thought ‚Äì and his consequent rejection of multi-faith positions ‚Äì was tenable within Theravada Buddhism. In terms of the global Buddhism of his day it aligned him with Buddhist rationalists and those who aimed at a Buddhist revival resisting colonial and missionary Christianity; this contrasted both with post-Theosophist Buddhists who saw all religions as ultimately one and with those who sought recognition for Buddhism as a world religion on a par with (and by implication extending equal recognition to) Christianity. Beyond this, his Buddhism seems to have focussed primarily on the major concerns for Burmese monks of the day, above all correct observance of the Vinaya. In western terms this reflected a persistent concern of plebeian freethinkers in particular to assert that morality without threat of religious punishment was entirely possible, and to his own temperance concerns. In Irish history, Dhammaloka stands out as a figure who rejected both Catholic and Protestant orthodoxies. Although not the only early Irish Buddhist or atheist, he is also striking among these as being of plebeian and Catholic origin, undermining popular accounts which see independent Ireland in particular as until recently homogenously Catholic. Like other early Irish Buddhists, he appears as having \\"gone native\\" in Buddhist Asia, representing an anti-colonial solidarity marked by work within Asian Buddhist organisations and a hostility to Christian missionaries and imperialism.

The tower was originally part of the Panorama Towers complex, and was initially known as Panorama Tower North. Groundbreaking took place in April 2006. The tower suffered from poor sales after its opening in 2008, and subsequently entered foreclosure. In 2011, the tower was renamed as The Martin, after Dean Martin, and was given a $3 million renovation which led to an increase in sales. The Martin is located across Interstate 15 from CityCenter. The building is tall, and has 45 floors and 372 total units.  History  In September 2004, a 35-story third tower, standing 500 feet tall, was approved by Clark County to become part of the Panorama Towers property, which was being developed by Andrew Sasson and Laurence Hallier. At that time, the third tower was planned to be slightly smaller than the other two towers, with only 250 units compared to 350 for the others. The project's second tower was scheduled to begin construction in January 2005, with construction on the third tower scheduled to begin six months later. A groundbreaking ceremony for the third tower was held on April 21, 2006. Pamela Anderson appeared at the event as Hallier's date. Other attendees included Steve Wynn, Ryan Seacrest, and Mickey Rourke. Taylor International was the general contractor for the tower, which was constructed north of Harmon Avenue and the project's two previous towers. Panorama Tower North opened in 2008, with 45 stories and 372 units. After its opening, the tower struggled with sales, as many units entered foreclosure or became short sales. In November 2008, istar Financial, the tower's construction lender, foreclosed on the property. In 2009, iStar acquired the property out of foreclosure. In January 2011, Panorama North was renamed The Martin as part of a marketing strategy to increase sales in the tower. The Martin was named after Dean Martin. A renovation of the tower was scheduled to begin in mid-September 2011. Improvements totaling $3 million were made to the tower, including a redesigned lobby with a library, and lounges at the pool. The renovation also included new landscaping and the addition of vintage furniture and retro d√©cor, as well as residential services such as concierge, car service, continental breakfast and room-cleaning. Renovations concluded in March 2012. Monthly sales subsequently increased, with strong sales occurring throughout 2012 and 2013.

Life Sorgner was born on 15 October 1973 in Wetzlar (Germany). He studied philosophy at King's College London (BA), the University of Durham (MA by thesis; examiners: David E. Cooper, Durham; David Owen, Southampton), the Justus-Liebig-Universit√§t Gie√üen and the Friedrich-Schiller- Universit√§t Jena (Dr. phil.; Examiners: Wolfgang Welsch, Jena; Gianni Vattimo, Turin). He taught philosophy and ethics at the Universities of Giessen, Jena, Erfurt and Erlangen. Currently, he teaches at a US Liberal Arts College, John Cabot University.http://www.johncabot.edu/directory/Faculty_Form.aspx?IdFaculty=578 Sorgner is a member of several editorial and advisory boards. Nietzsche, posthumanism and transhumanism In issue 20(1) of the Journal of Evolution and Technology, Sorgner's article ‚ÄúNietzsche, the Overhuman, and Transhumanism‚Äù was published in which he shows that there are significant similarities between Nietzsche's concept of the overhuman and the concept of the posthuman according to the view of some transhumanists. His interpretation brought about a response both among Nietzsche scholars as well as among transhumanists. The editors of the Journal of Evolution and Technology dedicated a special issue to the question concerning the relationship between transhumanism, Nietzsche and European posthumanist philosophies (posthumanism). Vol. 21 Issue 1 ‚Äì January 2010 of the Journal of Evolution and Technology was entitled \\"Nietzsche and European Posthumanisms\\" and it included responses to Sorgner's article, for example by Max More, Michael Hauskeller. Due to the intense debate, the editors of the journal decided to give Sorgner the chance to react to the articles. In vol. 21 Issue 2 ‚Äì October 2010, Sorgner replied to the various responses in his article \\"Beyond Humanism: Reflections on Trans- and Posthumanism\\". In addition, herein he also put forward some aspects of his own philosophical position which was strongly influenced by his teacher Gianni Vattimo. He accepts Vattimo's pensiero debole, but criticises Vattimo's understanding of the history of the weakening of being. As an alternative, Sorgner suggests a this-worldly, naturalist and perspectivist interpretation of the world, which he explained in more detail in his 2010 monograph \\"Menschenw√ºrde nach Nietzsche: Die Geschichte eines Begriffs\\" (WBG, Darmstadt 2010). Sorgner regards \\"Nihilism\\", as described by Nietzsche, \\"entirely a gain\\":Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, Menschenw√ºrde nach Nietzsche, Darmstadt WBG, 2010, p. 239: \\"durchaus als Gewinn\\". ‚ÄûFrom the perspective of my perspectivism, this also means that the prevalent conception of human dignity has no higher status in hitting truth as correspondence to reality than the conceptions of Adolf Hitler or Pol Pot.\\"Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, Menschenw√ºrde nach Nietzsche, Darmstadt WBG, 2010, p. 242: \\"Dies bedeutet auch, dass dem vorherrschenden Konzept der Menschenw√ºrde aus der Perspektive des Perspektivismus kein h√∂herer Status hinsichtlich der Erkenntnis der Wahrheit in Korrespondenz zur Wirklichkeit zukommt als den Konzeptionen Adolf Hitlers oder Pol Pots.\\" After bioethicists, and transhumanists had discussed the relationship between Nietzsche and transhumanism, the debate was taken up by some leading Nietzsche scholars: Keith Ansell-Pearson, Paul Loeb and Babette Babich wrote responses in the journal the Agonist which is being published by the Nietzsche Circle New York. Sorgner's perspectivist metahumanism and in particular his monograph \\"Menschenw√ºrde nach Nietzsche\\" (WBG 2010) was dealt with in a symposium organised by the Nietzsche Forum Munich which had been co-founded by Thomas Mann. Leading German philosophers, e.g. Annemarie Pieper, responded to Sorgner's radical suggestions concerning the need to revise the prevalent conception of human dignity at this event. In May 2013, the weekly newspaper Die Zeit published an interview with Sorgner in which several of his suggestions concerning human dignity, emerging technologies and trans- and posthumanism were summarized. In Autumn 2014, an essay collection entitled \\"Umwertung der Menschenw√ºrde\\" (edited by Beatrix Vogel) was published by Alber Verlag in which leading international theologians, philosophers, and ethicists wrote critical replies to Sorgner's suggestions concerning the notion \\"human dignity\\". Sorgner has been an invited and keynote speaker at many important events and conferences, e.g. Phil.cologne, TED, and the World Humanities Forum, ICISTS-KAIST.

Organization The battalion was organized in March 1862 by Colonel John L. Williamson, apparently immediately following the final muster of the 15th Arkansas Militia Regiment. Williamson had also commanded the 15th Arkansas Militia Regiment from Pope County. Three companies for this battalion were recruited from Pope County, including several former 15th Militia Regiment members. It was apparently intended to be recruited to a full regiment, but was still recruiting and organizing when it was swept up by General Earl Van Dorn when he transferred his army to Mississippi following the Battle of Pea Ridge. The battalion was formally organized at Camp Churchill Clark, near Corinth, Mississippi, on May 8, 1862. However, it was decided to disband the battalion instead, so the election of officers was invalidated and the battalion formally broken up on May 25, 1862. The battalion was composed of companies from the following counties: :Company A‚ÄîFranklin County (enlisted at Ozark, Arkansas, February 8, 1862) :Company B‚ÄîFranklin County (enlisted at Ozark, Arkansas, February 15, 1862) :Company C‚ÄîPope County (enlisted in Pope County, Arkansas, February 15, 1862) :Company D‚ÄîPope County (enlisted at Russellville, Arkansas, February 13, 1862) :Company E‚ÄîPope County (enlisted at Dover, Arkansas, February 22, 1862) :Company F‚ÄîYell County (enlisted at Bata‚Äôs Mill, Arkansas, February 28, 1862) :Company G‚ÄîYell County (enlisted at Dardanelle, Arkansas, February 28, 1862) :Company H‚ÄîConway County (enlisted at Portland, Arkansas, March 1, 1862).

It includes any combination of educational strategies, accompanied by environmental supports, designed to facilitate voluntary adoption of food choices and other food and nutrition-related behaviors conducive to health and well-being. Nutrition education is delivered through multiple venues and involves activities at the individual, community, and policy levels. Nutrition Education also critically looks at issues such as food security, food literacy, and food sustainability.  Overview  Nutrition education promotes healthy-eating and exercise behaviors. The work of nutrition educators takes place in colleges, universities and schools, government agencies, cooperative extension, communications and public relations firms, the food industry, voluntary and service organizations and with other reliable places of nutrition and health education information. Nutrition education is a mechanism to enhance awareness, as a means to self-efficacy, surrounding the trigger of healthy behaviors.  History of Net  In 1969, a recommendation from the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health stated that nutrition education should be part of school curriculums. It was authorized under the Children Nutrition Act.Womach, Jasper. \\"Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition.\\" CRS Report for Congress, 16 June 2005, digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs7246/m1/1/high_res_d/97-905_2005Jun16.pdf. In 1978, the Nutrition Education and Training (NET) program was created by the USDA, with the purpose of giving grants to help fund nutrition education programs under state educational systems. Funding for the program was targeted towards school children, teachers, parents, and service workers. In its inaugural year, the program was funded with $26 million gradually decreasing to $5 million in 1990. In 1996, NET was restored to temporary status.About Nutrition Reviews, Oxford Academic.

The main objectives of the Food and Nutrition Service are to use their 15 federal nutrition assistance programs to help reduce the risk of obesity and ensure that hunger is no longer a concern for US citizens. Some of their programs include WIC, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and school meals.

In school  = K-12 = Nutrition education programs within schools try to create behaviors that prevent students from potentially becoming obese, developing diabetes and cardiovascular issues, and forming negative emotional issues by educating students on the aspects of a healthy diet, emphasizing the consumption of lower fat dairy options and both fruits and vegetables. As most children eat between one and two of their meals at school, school-based nutrition education programs offer opportunities for students to practice making healthy eating decisions. However, due to influences outside of the school environment such as home, cultural, and social environments, there may be a lack of visible desired behavior changes. The National Center for Health Statistics October 2017 data brief, found that the prevalence of obesity among youth ages 2-19 has increased from 13.9 to 18.5 percent from 1999 to 2016.Graig M. Hales, et al. Prevalence of Obesity Among Adults and Youth: United States, 2015‚Äì2016. NCHS Data Brief, 288, Center for Disease Control, 1 Nov. 2017, pp. 1‚Äì7, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db288.pdf. = College = With eating behaviors, such as missing meals throughout the day and engaging in potentially dangerous self-prescribed weight loss methods, combined with a diet consisting of foods high in sodium, cholesterol and saturated fats, college students' dietary habits can potentially negatively affect their current and future health. A typical college student's diet does not contain enough vitamins, minerals or fiber. Limited in both the consumption of fruit and vegetables, research has shown that enrollment in a university nutrition class, emphasizing the consumption of fruits and vegetables and certain dietary habits that prevent chronic disease, significantly increased the students consumption of fruits and vegetables compared to their baseline consumption levels.  Current issues  Childhood obesity is a public health concern.Graig M. Hales, et al. Prevalence of Obesity Among Adults and Youth: United States, 2015‚Äì2016. NCHS Data Brief, 288, Center for Disease Control, 1 Nov. 2017, pp. 1‚Äì7, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db288.pdf. Recent estimates indicate that 17% of youth aged 2 to 19 years in the United States were obese in 2011 to 2012. Besides nutrition education, environmental factors such as a decrease in physical activity and increase in energy intake have led to more sedentary children.Ruebel, Meghan L., et al. Outcomes of a Family-Based Pediatric Obesity Program - Preliminary Results. p. 12. This increase in body mass index has led to hypertension, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes among other chronic diseases. Poor nutrition habits and lack of physical activity have led to this increase of obesity that leads from childhood to adulthood. A lack of funding and insufficient resources have led to poor nutrition education. Lack of funding has led to schools developing contracts with private companies such as soda and candy companies that allow vending machines and other products as well and has created a monopoly in public schools. Nutrition based policies use a trickle-down methods: federal, regional, state, local and school district policies. Teachers have a more direct influence in nutrition education. There are not a lot of studies that show how nutrition education policies affect the teachers in the schools they are meant to influence.

Officers who did not choose to stand for re-election were also offered a discharge. The reorganization was accomplished among all the Arkansas regiments in and around Corinth, Mississippi, following the Battle of Shiloh. On May 25, 1862, a tenth company reassigned from Williamson's Arkansas Infantry Battalion was added to McCray's Battalion which was stationed at Camp Churchill Clark, near Corinth, and the battalion was reorganized as the 31st Arkansas Infantry Regiment on May 27, 1862. McCray was elected colonel of the regiment. The unit would continue to occasionally be referred to as a sharpshooter regiment, but evidence suggest that the unit was trained and employed as a standard infantry regiment. The unit was made up of volunteer companies from the following companies: Colonel Thomas Hamilton McCrayCompany A was organized at Jacksonport, Arkansas, on November 2, 1861, Captain James M.

Battles  Brigadier General William L. Cabell had officially replaced General Hogg, who had sickened and died on 16 May, in command of a brigade that included the 31st Arkansas along with the 10th, 11th, 14th Texas Cavalry (dismounted) Regiments, but it appears that Colonel McCray had the field command of this organization as early as June 1, 1862.Odom, Danny \\"Re: Where was 31st Arkansas Infantry at Stones Riv\\" Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 25 June 2012, Accessed 26 June 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/webbbs_config.pl?noframes;read=26685 In response to a growing threat of invasion of northern Georgia, General Bragg ordered Major General McCown to move his division of the Army of the West to Chattanooga and report for duty to General Kirby Smith.United States. War Dept. The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union And Confederate Armies. Series 1, Volume 17, In Two Parts. Part 2, Correspondence, Etc., Book, 1887; digital images, (http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth154627/m1/626/?q=31st Arkansas McCray : accessed June 25, 2012), University of North Texas Libraries, The Portal to Texas History, http://texashistory.unt.edu; crediting UNT Libraries, Denton, Texas. In General Bragg's return of the Army of Mississippi and the Army of the West, the 31st is listed as belonging to a brigade commanded by Brigadier General W. L. Cabell with 3 regiments of dismounted cavalry from Texas. In preparation for the upcoming Kentucky Campaign, General Smith reorganized his forces and Colonel McCray's brigade was placed in Churchill's Division of General Smith's Confederate Army of Kentucky. With Colonel McCray in command of the brigade, command of the 31st Arkansas fell to Major J. W. Clark. Under Clark's command the regiment took an active part in the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky and reported one killed, and nine wounded. After the Kentucky Campaign, General Bragg united his Army of Mississippi and the Army of Kentucky to create the Army of Tennessee. Colonel Mathew Ector, a Texan, was promoted to brigadier general and on October 31, 1862, was given command the mostly Texas brigade that McCray had led in the Kentucky Campaign. The 31st Arkansas was transferred to the brigade commanded by Brigadier General Evander McNair.Ector's Brigade In The Civil War By Billy Kurtz West Jr., B.S. In Ed. A Thesis In History. When the regiment was first reported as a part of McNair's Brigade on November 21, 1862, it only had 131 men fit for duty. The 31st Arkansas missed the first major engagement with its new brigade. The unit was at Shelbyville Tennessee when the rest of McNair's brigade fought in the Battle of Murfreesboro, December 31, 1862 ‚Äì January 2, 1863. Heavy casualties suffered at Murfreesboro in McNair's Brigade caused several field (temporary) consolidations among its regiments. On February 9, 1863, the 31st Arkansas was temporarily consolidated with the 25th Arkansas Infantry. Colonel McCray was placed in command of the consolidated 25th/31st Arkansas. In June, 1863, McNair's Brigade was reassigned to Walker's (later French's) Division of the Army of the Department of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana, Lieutenant General William J. Hardee, C. S. Army, commanding, under the overall command of General Joseph E. Johnston who was assigned the mission of organizing a force to attempt to relieve General Pemberton's besieged army at Vicksburg. Johnston had been gathering troops at Jackson, intending to relieve pressure on Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton's beleaguered garrison. Johnston cautiously advanced his 30,000 soldiers toward the rear of Grant's army surrounding Vicksburg.Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books. War on the Mississippi: Grant's Vicksburg Campaign. Alexandria, VA: Time-Life Books, 1985. , Page 156. In response, Grant ordered Sherman to deal with Johnston's threat. By July 1, 1863, Johnston's force was in position along the Big Black River. Sherman used the newly arrived IX Corps to counter this threat. On July 5, the day after the surrender of Vicksburg was made official; Sherman was free to move against Johnston. Johnston hastily withdrew his force across the Big Black River and Champion's Hill battlefields with Sherman in pursuit. Sherman had with him the IX Corps, XV Corps, XIII Corps, and a detachment of the XVI Corps. On July 10 the Union Army had taken up position around Jackson. The heaviest fighting in the Siege of Jackson came on July 11 during an unsuccessful Union attack, which resulted in heavy casualties.Gue, Benjamin F. History of Iowa From the Earliest Times to the Beginning of the Twentieth Century/4 Vol. 4. Iowa Biography, 1903, p. 164. Instead of risking entrapment, Johnston chose to evacuate the state capital and withdrew on July 16. Sherman's forces occupied the city the following day. In the aftermath of the Vicksburg Campaign most of Johnston's army was transferred back to the Army of Tennessee. By August 10, 1863, Colonel McCray had requested transfer to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi and reported to General Kirby Smith, at Shreveport Louisiana by mid September. Several additional consolidations occurred in McNair's Brigade during the month of August and were made official September 1, 1863. Depleted by deaths and desertions, the 31st Arkansas Regiment and the 4th Arkansas Infantry Battalion were permanently consolidated with the 4th Arkansas Infantry Regiment on September 1, 1863. With barely enough men left to fill up two companies in the consolidated regiment, the 31st Arkansas boys served under the 4th Arkansas Regiment's Colonel Henry Gaston Bunn until the end of the war. The McNair's Brigade rejoined the Army of Tennessee near Tullahoma, Tennessee, in September, 1863. The 4th/4th Bn/31st Arkansas Consolidated Infantry went into the Battle of Chickamauga with an aggregate of 250. Fighting with remarkable courage at the Battle of Chickamauga, in September 1863, nine men of the old 31st Arkansas were awarded the Confederate equivalent of the Medal of Honor. The 31st Arkansas disappeared from the records after January 20, 1864. All references to the 31st Arkansas as a separate command effectively end after January 1864, with the survivors of the regiment serving with the 4th Arkansas through the Atlanta Campaign, Hood's Tennessee Campaign, and the final actions of the Army of Tennessee in the Carolinas Campaign of 1865.  Consolidation and surrender  On April 9, 1865, the depleted Arkansas regiments of D. H. Reynolds' Brigade, Walthall's Division, Confederate Army of Tennessee, including the 31st Arkansas, were consolidated into a single regiment the 1st Arkansas Consolidated Mounted Rifles, at Smithfield, North Carolina. The companies of the consolidated regiment were consolidated from the following Arkansas regiments: * Company A ‚Äì 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles * Company B ‚Äì 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles * Company C ‚Äì 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles * Company D ‚Äì 2nd Arkansas Mounted Rifles * Company E ‚Äì 4th Arkansas Infantry * Company F ‚Äì 4th Arkansas Infantry * Company G ‚Äì 31st Arkansas Infantry * Company H ‚Äì 9th Arkansas Infantry * Company I ‚Äì 9th Arkansas Infantry * Company K ‚Äì 25th Arkansas Infantry The 1st Arkansas Consolidated Mounted Rifles surrendered with the Army of Tennessee at Greensboro, North Carolina, April 26, 1865. About a dozen soldiers of the 31st Arkansas men were left when the consolidated rifles regiment surrendered. The 1st Arkansas Consolidated Mounted Rifles were paroled on May 1, 1865, at Jamestown, North Carolina. After the surrender, the men were offered free rail transportation (where available) in the direction of their homes, by what was left of the Southern railway companies. Most of the men traveled by rail, where they could. A large number of men were killed or seriously injured in a railroad accident at Flat Creek Bridge, Tennessee, on May 25, 1865.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"Re: 25 Infantry Company C\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 20 March 2005, Accessed 8 February 2012, http://history-sites.com/cgi- bin/bbs53x/arcwmb/arch_config.pl?read=9849  See also  * List of Arkansas Civil War Confederate units * Lists of American Civil War Regiments by State * Confederate Units by State * Arkansas in the American Civil War * Arkansas Militia in the Civil War  References   Bibliography  * Bass, Ronald R.

It is located southeast of Lake Charles, Louisiana. It was closed in 1995 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Eastern Air Defense Sector (EADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-14. History Lake Charles Air Force Station was, actually, two different facilities that shared the same location, active in two different eras. The first Lake Charles Air Force Station (ADC ID: TM-194) was as part of the Phase III of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. On October 20, 1953 ADC requested a third phase of twenty-five radar sites be constructed. The 812th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the new base on 30 April 1957 by the 33d Air Division. In 1958 the 812th AC&W; Squadron activated AN/FPS-3A and AN/FPS-6 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. On 1 September 1961, the 812th was inactivated, and the Lake Charles site was converted into a gap-filler radar site (M-125D) for England AFB, LA, operating an AN/FPS-18. The FPS-18 inactivated on 30 June 1963 along with the 653d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at England Air Force Base. The second Lake Charles Air Force Station was opened in 1972 when Tactical Air Command (TAC) constructed five new buildings at the former Lake Charles (TM-194) site. The new station was designated with NORAD ID Z-248. TAC set up an AN/TPS-43 radar on the newly constructed search tower. Eventually, Aerospace Defense Command assumed control of the site, and placed AN/FPS-93 and AN/FPS-6 radars at the site. These radars were operated as Operating Location F of the Houston-based 630th Radar Squadron during 1972 and 1973. Control of the site was reassigned to the 634th Radar Squadron on 1 January 1973, and inactivated on 1 July 1974. After the 634th RADS inactivated, activities were assumed by Operating Location D of the Tyndall AFB-based 678th Air Defense Group as part of the Southeast Air Defense Sector (SEADS). The site continued operations over the next two decades with approximated twenty Air Force and civilian personnel with the 678th ADG tracking aircraft attempting to illegally enter the country. The final radars were an AN/FPS-91A search radar and an AN/FPS-116height-finder radar (retired c. 1988). Lake Charles AFS closed for good on 30 September 1995, being replaced by a new FAA ARSR-4 Joint Surveillance System (JSS) site on the northwest side of the city of Lake Charles. Today, for the first radar Site TM-194, the original Operations Building and the Power Plant are still extant on the west end of the site, and the original HQ Building is still extant near the site entrance. A private residence occupies the site of the original GAG Radio facility, later gap-filler annex (M-125D), on the east end of the site. Nothing visible remains of the site's second incarnation, Z-248. The current owner of the site is McNeese State University.

The unit was formed from the following Volunteer companies: * Company A ‚Äî Dallas County (Princeton Light Horse). * Company B ‚Äî Perry County (Perry Rangers). * Company C ‚Äî Saline County (Saline Rifle Rangers). * Company D ‚Äî Pulaski County (Danley‚Äôs Rangers). * 1st Company E ‚Äî Pope County (transferred from Williamson's Arkansas Infantry Battalion, May 26, 1862). * 2nd Company E ‚Äî \\"Border Rangers\\" of White County and \\"Crittenden Rangers\\" of Crittenden County (transferred from 2nd Arkansas Cavalry Regiment, January 1, 1863). * Company F ‚Äî Hot Spring County (Hot Springs Cavalry). * Company G ‚Äî Ouachita County (Ouachita Cavalry). * Company H ‚Äî Ouachita County (Camden Cavalry). * Company I ‚Äî Conway County (transferred from Williamson's Arkansas Infantry Battalion, May 26, 1862). * Company K ‚Äî Yell County (transferred from Williamson's Arkansas Infantry Battalion, May 26, 1862). The regiment was armed with weapons which the state confiscated when the Federal Arsenal at Little Rock was seized by Arkansas State Militia troops in February 1861. Disposition of the weapons found in the Arsenal is somewhat sketchy, but from various records it can be surmised that the 9th and 10th Arkansas, Kelly's 9th Arkansas Battalion, and the 3d Arkansas Cavalry were issued flintlock Hall's Rifles from the Arsenal.Ezell, Tom, \\"Re: Van Dorn- Army of the Southwest\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 17 December 2001, Accessed 11 June 2012, Battles When the 3d Arkansas Cavalry was transferred from Arkansas to Mississippi in 1862, only 395 effectives crossed the Mississippi River. The regiment was dismounted when it fought at the Battle of Corinth, Mississippi, then was remounted and assigned to General Armstrong's and T. Harrison's Brigade. The 3d Arkansas Cavalry served under Major-General ‚ÄúFighting Joe‚Äù Wheeler in the Confederate Army of Mississippi for much of the war.

See also Peter Grosse, Operation Rollback (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2000). Returning to the State Department, Thayer served briefly as consul general in Munich before returning to the United States to direct the Department's International Broadcasting Division (later known as the Voice of America) in 1948-49. He developed an antagonistic relationship with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover when he complained publicly that the FBI's slow processing of security clearances was hampering the Division's staffing. Hoover's investigation of Thayer's secretary revealed that she had borne his child. The FBI pursued an investigation (although he did not require a security clearance from the FBI), and found he had \\"communist sympathy\\" and was \\"undoubtedly a homosexual.\\" Hoover failed in two attempts (in 1949 and 1950) to persuade other government agencies that Thayer posed a security risk.Robert D.

Resignation Thayer held consular positions in Germany from 1949 to 1953. Beginning in 1950, when Thayer was serving as political liaison officer in the Bonn embassy, several anonymous letters denounced him to Senator Joseph McCarthy and his Senate allies as a Communist sympathizer with a history of financial profiteering and sexual immorality both homosexual and heterosexual. He was being protected, according to one of the anonymous sources, by allies in the State Department, especially his brother-in-law Charles E. Bohlen.Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 98ff. Senate investigators used these letters and other documents obtained from a variety of government security investigations to target a series of government officials, starting with the forced resignation of Carmel Offie from the CIA in May 1950.Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 104-5 The evidence against Thayer collected by Senate investigators was based on \\"hostile gossip and speculation by Thayer's enemies, and premised on guilt by association.\\"Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 105-6 They learned, for example, that during his OSS service \\"Thayer was waited on regularly by a native Yugoslav waiter. named Marko, who was a known homosexual.\\" Thayer's marriage to Maria Petrucci, the daughter of an Italian diplomat, lasted less than two years, which one informant attributed to homosexuality, though she later denied this. Thayer was a friend of Alexander Kirk, a Foreign Service officer with a homosexual reputation who had retired in 1945, and others.Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 106ff. Much of the impulse behind the investigations of political and sexual irregularities reflected resentment of the foreign policy establishment, their elite backgrounds, cosmopolitanism, and association with bohemians and the politically unorthodox.Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 120-1, 141-2 Senate pressure forced the State Department to review Thayer's status. He returned from Germany to testify that \\"he had never performed a homosexual act.\\"Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 110 Though cleared, he remained under surveillance by the State Department's security division.Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 112 When Thayer was moved to a new post in Munich and Senator Pat McCarran demanded a full report on his \\"experience, qualifications, moral character, and loyalty,\\" the State Department waited a month to respond with a glowing report that included no qualifications. McCarthy renewed and expanded his attacks following Republican gains in the 1952 elections when the new Secretary of State John Foster Dulles decided to cooperate with Senate investigators.Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 114 Finally, at the end of March 1953, after much bureaucratic infighting, Thayer was forced to resign in order to win Senate confirmation of his brother-in-law Charles Bohlen as Ambassador to Russia.Dean, Imperial Brotherhood, 133-5; New York Times: \\"Bohlen's Relative Quits,\\" March 27, 1953, February 1, 2011 The Suddeutsche Zeitung regretted his departure and expressed concern that the effect on government operations of a \\"wave of McCarthyism...must be devastating.\\"New York Times: \\"'Wave of McCarthyism' Decried,\\" March 28, 1953, accessed February 1, 2011 Later years Thayer moved to Majorca to live inexpensively beyond the reach of Senate subpoenas.

In Kardashev scale, Type II and Type III civilizations can harness energy on the required scale. Dyson, Freeman J. (1966). Marshak, R. E. (ed.). \\"The Search for Extraterrestrial Technology\\". Perspectives in Modern Physics.

Dordrecht, D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985, p. 497‚Äì504.  Examples  =Exploratory engineering= *Dyson spheres or Dyson swarm and similar constructs are hypothetical megastructures originally described by Freeman Dyson as a system of orbiting solar power satellites meant to enclose a star completely and capture most or all of its energy output. * Star lifting is a process where an advanced civilization could remove a substantial portion of a star's matter in a controlled manner for other uses. *Matrioshka brains *Stellar engine *An Alderson disk (named after Dan Alderson, its originator) is a hypothetical artificial astronomical megastructure, a giant platter with a thickness of several thousand miles. The Sun rests in the hole at the center of the disk. The outer perimeter of an Alderson disk would be roughly equivalent to the orbit of Mars or Jupiter. =Science fiction= * In the Ringworld series by Larry Niven, a ring a million miles wide is built and spun (to simulate gravity) around a star roughly one astronomical unit away. The ring can be viewed as a functional version of a Dyson sphere with the interior surface area of 3 million Earth-sized planets. Because it is only a partial Dyson sphere, it can be viewed as a construction of a civilization intermediary between Type I and Type II. Both Dyson spheres and the Ringworld suffer from gravitational instability, however‚Äîa major focus of the Ringworld series is coping with this instability in the face of partial collapse of the Ringworld civilization. * Stephen Baxter's \\"Morlock\\" of The Time Ships occupy a spherical shell around the sun the diameter of earth's orbit, spinning for gravity along one band. The shell's inner surface along this band is inhabited by cultures in many lower stages of development, while the K II Morlock civilization uses the entire structure for power and computation. * In the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \\"Relics\\", the Enterprise discovers an abandoned Dyson sphere. * In the Halo universe, the Forerunners created many planet-sized artificial megastructures, such as the Halo ringworlds, the two Arks, and the Shield Worlds, which were micro-Dyson spheres. One of the Precursors' most well known creations were the Star Roads: immense, indestructible cables that connected planets and star systems. *In the movie Elysium, a large-scale space habitat has been built to orbit Earth and is capable of sustaining life permanently. * In the Corellian Trilogy (Star Wars Legends books), the Corellian system is revealed to have been constructed by an unknown ancient civilization, using Centerpoint Station to transport the planets across interstellar distances, and \\"planetary repulsors\\" to maneuver the planets into their orbits. *In Iain M. Banks' fictional Culture universe, an Orbital is a purpose-built space habitat forming a ring typically around 3 million km (1.9 million miles) in diameter. The rotation of the ring simulates both gravity and a day-night cycle comparable to a planetary body orbiting a star. *The Dyson shell is the variant of the Dyson sphere most often depicted in fiction. It is a uniform solid shell of matter around the star, as opposed to a swam of orbiting satellites. In response to letters prompted by some papers, Dyson replied, \\"A solid shell or ring surrounding a star is mechanically impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which I envisaged consists of a loose collection or swarm of objects travelling on independent orbits around the star.\\" Gallery Image:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svgDyson shell Image:Culture's orbital.jpgOrbital with no apparent hub File:Alderson disk.svgAlderson disk File:OrbitalRing.svgA proposed plan for an orbital ring See also *Planetary engineering *Terraforming *Stellar engineering *Megascale engineering *Space manufacturing References Further reading Category:Exploratory engineering Category:Science fiction themes Category:Megastructures ","title":"Astronomical engineering"},{"id":"30643820","text":"thumb Glenn Hetrick is a special make-up effects artist/designer originally from Hellertown, Pennsylvania.

He became vicar of Good Shepherd Mission in (West) Berkeley, California, in 1957. Following this early work in the United States, in January 1960 he continued his ministry overseas in the Republic of the Philippines, serving as director of Easter School (Baguio) and St. Elizabeth's School (Benguet Mines) in addition to circuit riding a dozen outstation missions in the Mountain Provine of Luzon. In order to use his Chinese language, he was transferred as assistant priest at the Chinese St. Stephen's Parish and as assistant chaplain, then chaplain, to the 4,000 students at St. Stephen's High School, Manila. He was also the founding vicar of the Emmanuel Mission, Tondo, Manila. His work as a missionary in the Philippines spanned seven years, and, when he ultimately made the decision to serve as a navy chaplain, he was commissioned at the U.S. Embassy in Manila.\\"Veterans Parade Grand Marshal Was a Navy Chaplain,\\" Shasta Lake Bulletin, November 2, 2005. Accessed January 26, 2011. Following graduation from the U.S. Naval Chaplains School in 1966, he served on active duty as a navy chaplain for more than twenty years, including assignments with the 3rd Marine Division in the Republic of Vietnam, and as circuit riding chaplain attached to Naval Support Activity Saigon, visiting U.S. military personnel throughout the Mekong and Bassac rivers in Vietnam's Mekong Delta. At Naval Training Center San Diego, he established the Family Concern Unit, introducing family therapy to the sea services, which inspired the Family Service Centers in the Navy and Marine Corps several years later. He served as command chaplain to and Submarine Squadron 15 in Guam, to the eight ammunition ships of Service Squadron 3, and as command chaplain for the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and Naval Hospital Oakland. In the 2005 book, \\"Mobile Riverine Force,\\" Westling is quoted as saying he covered so many units in Vietnam, from ships to small groups of men on ambush missions, that on one Christmas he held 18 Christmas Eve or Christmas Day worship services, and \\"almost that many Easter services.\\"Mobile Riverine Fore, Turner Publishing Co., 2005. Some of Westling's experiences as a circuit riding chaplain would become part of training materials for future chaplains, documenting the way his work, far from chapels or military bases, allowed him to offer ministry even to military advisors who had never received \\"regular chaplain visitation\\" or support.History of the Chaplain Corps, Part 4, U.S. Navy Nonresident Training Course (NAVEDTRA 14284), August 1988. Additionally, his work was recorded as an example of ways that chaplains, in addition to their primary role of supporting military personnel, could also become instrumental in civic actions that could build trust with local residents. Throughout his career, Westling was recognized as someone strong in his own faith but dedicated to the work of helping those of other faiths grow stronger in those faiths. In the article, \\"Prayers That Hurt,\\" Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff writes of his time as a Naval officer in Vietnam's Mekong Delta, crediting Westling as the chaplain who inspired him to \\"grow as a Jew,\\" and then make the decision to become a rabbi.Resnicoff, Arnold E., \\"Prayers That Hurt,\\" Curtana Journal archives.

Currently, there is only one species known, named L. taquetrensis by Diego Pol, Alberto Garrido and Ignacio A. Cerda in 2011. The fossil, an incomplete subadult individual, was found in the Las Leoneras Formation in Argentina. This formation is probably Early Jurassic in age. Leonerasaurus was a small non-sauropod sauropodomorph, showing an unusual combination of basal and derived characters. This indicates that the evolution of early sauropodomorphs witnessed a great degree of convergent evolution. Description Restoration Leonerasaurus taquetrensis is known from one incomplete individual. Parts of a dentary and some teeth, neck and trunk vertebrae, a sacrum, parts of the pectoral (shoulder) and pelvis (hip) girdle as well as several limb bones were found. Much of the remains were found in articulation. It was only 2.40 meters long, 1 m high and weighing about 70 kg. =Dentary and teeth= Of the skull only the anterior part of the right dentary was found. Near the area where it touches the contralateral element at the tip of the lower jaw (the symphysis) the bone is straight and only gently arched medially, as is seen in basal sauropods. More derived sauropods (eusauropods) have medially broadly arching symphyseal regione and anterior portions of the tooth row. The ventral (lower) edge of the dentary is damaged, but does not appear to be ventrally deflected at the symphysis as in some basal sauropodomorphs such as Plateosaurus. Also, a longitudinal ridge that is seen in some basal sauropodomorphs (e.g., Massospondylus, Coloradisaurus and Plateosaurus) is not preserved in Leonerasaurus. However, this may be related to the damaged state of the specimen. Lateral and medial view of the dentary On the dentary, 13 teeth or tooth fragments were found. There are two empty alveoli, so that the total tooth count on one side was at least 15. Three teeth were found isolated near the dentary. The teeth and alveoli are angled forward (procumbent) by ~60¬∞, similar to eusauropods, but also to juveniles of Mussaurus. Tooth height and width decreases from the front to the back, and neighboring teeth overlapping each other. The edges of the teeth in the front of the jaw likely were not serrated, or at least only at the crown tips. This is usually the case in eusauropods. Teeth further back in the dentary are nearly all damaged, but a not erupted tooth has large denticles similar to basal sauropodomorphs. This pattern of teeth without denticles in front, and teeth with denticles in the back of the lower jaw is also seen in juveniles of Mussaurus and Melanorosaurus. Also, in contrast to eusauropod teeth, there are no high-angle wear facets on the teeth of Leonorasaurus. The anterior teeth are spoon- shaped, with the outer surface convex (bulging out), the inner one concave (hollowed out), again resembling basal sauropods. The surface texture, however, is more similar to basal sauropodomorphs, and not to sauropods. =Vertebrae= The neck of Leonorasaurus is known almost completely, only the atlas is lost. The nine remaining cervicals were found articulated with the first five complete dorsal (trunk) vertebrae. Additionally, a probable sixth dorsal and an articulated group of three mid-dorsals were found. Fragments of more posterior dorsals and of ribs were also recovered. The sacrum (fused vertebrae that form the core of the hip), consisting of four vertebrae, is nearly complete, but no bones of the tail was recovered. Cervical vertebrae Sacrum in dorsal, ventral, and lateral view The overall shape of the neck vertebrae is typical for basal sauropodomorphs, but Pol et al. interpret the remains of the neural arches to indicate a more sauropod-like shape. Some characters, however, show an intermediate development. In the trunk, the vertebrae show typical non-sauropod characters, such as relatively long and low neural arches with a narrow anterior ridge (the anteriormost dorsal vertebrae have slightly high neural arches), an anteriorly placed parapophysis (one of the articulation points for the ribs), and lack of or less strong development of certain laminae (thin ridges). The diapophysis (the second articulation for the rib) is also in the same position as in basal sauropodomorphs. A lamina connecting the diapophysis to the prezygapophysis on all dorsals, but not in no-sauropod sauropodomorphs, is present in the posterior dorsals. Phylogenetic position Leonerasaurus appears to be belong into the Anchisauria, as the closest sister taxon to the group sauropods (following Yates) \\\\+ Melanorosaurus (M. is seen as a sauropod by some researchers). A cladogram after Pol, Garrido & Cerda, 2011, illustrates a possible placing of Leonerasaurus in Sauropodomorpha: Discovery Right humerus in anterior, posterior, and lateral view The fossils assigned to Leonerasaurus were found near Ca√±ad√≥n Las Leoneras (an affluent of the left margin of the Chubut river), southeast of Sierra de Taquetr√©n, Chubut Province, Central Patagonia, Argentina. This formation is probably early Jurassic in age, interpreted as Pliensbachian to Toarcian or late Sinemurian to Toarcian. The volcanic facies of the overlying Lonco Trapial Formation is certainly from the Middle Jurassic, so that the younger boundary of the Las Leoneras Formation is well constrained. However, a Late Triassic affinity cannot be rules out, because the lower constraint of the formation is not well-defined. =Etymology= The generic name is derived from Leoneras, in reference to the lithostratigraphic unit where this taxon was found, and saurus, \\"lizard\\" (Latinized Greek). The specific name taquetrensis refers to the Sierras de Taquetr√©n, where Las Leoneras Formation crops out in Central Patagonia.

Various matches were made on a casual basis but in time these were more formalised. The first recognised Champion was Charles Campbell (rower) who beat John Williams in September 1831 on the Thames. Various persons then held the Championship which was gained under the challenge system. In June 1876 Edward Trickett of Australia won the Championship and then the Title became the World Sculling Championship See this entry for a list of Champions and races, and other details, from 1831 to 1876. English Championship Trickett returned to Australia and apparently took the English title with him. There arose innumerable disputes as to who was the resident champion in England. To bring order out of chaos the proprietors of the ‚ÄúDaily Chronicle‚Äù offered a silver cup as an emblem for the English Championship and stated that it was first to be rowed for in an open regatta. The winner would then be subject to challenges under the usual challenge system. However any sculler who won it three times in succession could claim it as their personal property. This arrangement was fairly common in professional sport in those days. The regatta was held on the Tyne in March 1877 and the cup was won by Robert W. Boyd when he beat W. Nicholson of Stockton. The following races were held subsequently. *28 May 1877 Boyd beat John Higgins on the Thames. *8 Oct 1877 Higgins beat Boyd, Thames. *14 Jan 1878 Higgins beat Boyd on a foul, on the Tyne. *3 June 1878 Higgins beat William Elliott, Thames. Higgins thus became the permanent holder and owner of the cup. To encourage the sport the proprietors of the London ‚ÄúSportsman‚Äù gave another cup to be raced for on similar conditions. The regatta was held on the Thames in September 1878 and in the final Elliott won on a foul against Boyd. The following races were held subsequently. *16 Feb 1879 Elliott beat Higgins, Tyne. *16 June 1879 Ned Hanlan beat Elliott, Tyne. *15 Nov 1880 Hanlan beat Trickett, Thames. (This was also a World Championship Race.) *14 Feb 1881 Hanlan beat Elias C. Laycock. Thames. (This also was a World Championship Race.) *3 April 1882 Hanlan beat Boyd. Tyne. (Also a World Championship Race.) At this point Hanlan was the owner of the Cup. He went on to race many World Title races and United States Championship races but it seems that he never defended his English Championship Title. Another ‚ÄúSportsman Cup‚Äù was provided for by the company and this became the trophy which was raced for. As Hanlan was Canadian the question arose again of who was, or should be, the English Champion. The next race was 20 June 1882 when J Largan of Wandsworth beat H Pearce of Sydney on the Thames. *26 May 1886, G J Perkins beat Australian Neil Matterson on the Thames. Matterson was also an unsuccessful contender for the World Title. *7 Feb 1887 George Bubear of Hammersmith beat Perkins on the Tyne. *Bubear himself was beaten in the next race on the 13 Feb 1888 by Canadian Wallace Ross on the Thames. From this point English sculling was at a low ebb with the centre of activity having gone to Australia and Sydney in particular. Ross was induced to put his English Championship up for the following race. He did not defend his title. *9 September 1888 Henry Ernest Searle beat another Canadian William Joseph O'Connor on the Thames. This was also a World Title race. Searle died in 1889 and the next race was; *30 Nov 1891 when William East of Isleworth beat Perkins on the Tyne. Again he seems not to have defended it. *30 Jan 1893 G. Bubear beat George H. Hosmer of Boston USA, on the Thames. *25 Sept 1893 Tom Sullivan (rower) of New Zealand beat Bubear on the Thames. *16 Feb 1895 Englishman Charles R. Harding (Sullivan's trainer) beat Sullivan on the Tyne. *On 9 September 1895 they had a re-match on the Championship Course on the Thames and again Harding won. His time was 22 minutes 59 seconds. *In July 1896, Harding challenged the Australian Jim Stanbury for the World Sculling Championship Title. The race took place on the Thames but Stanbury defended his world title and won the wager of ¬£500 a side. At stake was the English Title as well and this was won by Stanbury. *7 Sept 1896 Jacob Gaudaur, a Canadian beat Stanbury on the Thames. Gaudaur did not defend his title. * 21 September 1898. W. A. Barry beat George Towns on the Championship Course (London,) George Towns of Australia had gone to England in April 1897 with financial assistance from his supporters. In May 1899 won the Championship of England from W.A. Barry, a brother of Ernest Barry. The following year in September he defended his English title against a challenger from Australia, James Wray. Towns went on to win the World Championship but it was not until October 1908 that he defended his English Title. Towns travelled to England where he unsuccessfully defended his English Title on the Thames. He did not lose without a fight as his conqueror (Ernest Barry) had to row a record time over the course to win. The stakes were ¬£400.

Developed during the early 1970s, the project, possibly derived from the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow, was cancelled before the start of detailed design work. Development and cancellation In the early 1970s, the United States Navy initiated a project for the development of a new surface-to-air missile to act as a defense against air and missile attack against its vessels. The project received the planning designation ZRIM-101A in 1973.Parsch 2002Morison and Rowe 1975, p.216.Andrade 1979, p.235. The RIM-101 missile was planned to be a tube-launched weapon, a small ejector charge being used to propel the missile from its launching tube before ignition of a solid-fueled rocket sustainer, based on that of the FIM-43 Redeye SAM. Midcourse guidance of the new missile was planned to be of the semi-active radar homing type, using an I-band radar system, while terminal guidance would be provided by an infrared seeker. However, the RIM-101 project was cancelled early in the design-and-development stage, before any hardware had been built. It has been speculated that the RIM-101 was intended to be an advanced development of the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile, then in U.S. Navy service as the Basic Point Defense Missile System. While the basic RIM-7 does not match the description of RIM-101, an advanced development of the RIM-7E would fit the timeframe and description, with RIM-7F being developed following the cancellation of RIM-101.Parsch 2007 References =Notes= =Bibliography=  * External links * Category:Naval surface-to-air missiles of the United States Category:Abandoned military rocket and missile projects of the United States ","title":"RIM-101"},{"id":"30643919","text":"Groum√©ra is a rural commune and village in the Cercle of Di√©ma in the Kayes Region of western Mali.

He was trained in engraving by his father, but is primarily remembered now as a player of the Northumbrian smallpipes. Background Thomas Bewick had wished to encourage the Northumbrian smallpipes, and to support the piper John Peacock; in his autobiographical Memoir, written in the 1820s, he wrote Peacock's Tunes, 2nd ed., Northumbrian Pipers' Society (1999), Some time before the American War broke out, there had been a lack of musical performers upon our streets, and in this interval, I used to engage John Peacock, our inimitable performer, to play on the Northumberland or Small-pipes; and with his old tunes, his lilts, his pauses, and his variations, I was always excessively pleased. William Green, piper to the Duke of Northumberland, considered Peacock to be the best small pipes player he ever heard in his life. He was probably the first player of the instrument to play an extended keyed chanter. Such chanters were developed in the first decades of the 19th century, by John Dunn, in association with Peacock, and by Robert Reid. Thomas Bewick encouraged Peacock to teach pupils to become masters of this kind of music; from records in Thomas's cashbooks, noting payments to Peacock for lessons, we know that one of these pupils was Thomas's own son, Robert. Beside some of the entries for these payments, Thomas made sketches of Robert piping.  His work  Woodcut by Robert Elliot Bewick of Bewick's swan, named after his father by William Yarrell. Robert was himself trained as an engraver, being at first apprenticed and later a partner in his father's workshop; after his father's death he inherited and continued the business. Some engravings by him are shown on the Bewick Society's website. A major project which Robert began with his father, to conclude Thomas's series of natural histories, was a 'History of British Fishes'. Although this was never completed, drawings for this, and many others on various subjects, are in the British Museum:  His music  This ball ticket was engraved by Robert Bewick, from a drawing by his father. The seated piper is Robert himself. Although, as a boy, Robert had learned the Northumbrian smallpipes from arguably the best piper of his age, there is no evidence he was himself a virtuoso performer. There are however surviving accounts of his playing, and it is clear that this was much appreciated. To Northumbrian pipers nowadays, his importance nowadays lies more in the 5 manuscript books of Northumbrian smallpipe tunes he left. Three of these, signed by him, and dated between 1832 and 1843, give a very detailed picture of the broad repertoire of a Northumbrian piper at this early stage in the instrument's development, only a few decades after the earliest keyed chanters appeared. As well as some tunes apparently copied from Peacock's tunebook, there are some in a similar style with a one octave range, and are an important and somewhat later development from this body of surviving 18th century pipe tunes. Some tunes seem to be adaptations of Border pipe tunes, with a 9-note range and a flat 7th. Others are transcriptions of fiddle tunes, many of them Scottish, with a range typically from D to b, exploiting the extended range of the novel keyed chanter. As some of the tunes are in E minor, needing a d sharp key, it is clear that this key must have been added to some chanters before the books were written down. The repertoire in the books was significantly wider than just Northumbrian and Scottish traditional music, including contemporary ballroom music as well as classical pieces, such as a Duett by Mozart, which is an arrangement of Das klinget so herrlich from The Magic Flute. After Robert's death, his sisters gave his pipes and tunebooks to the artist and tune collector Joseph Crawhall, who did much to encourage the Northumbrian smallpipes. Subsequently these books were given to Gateshead Public Library, where they remain. Robert's pipes, These Northumbrian smallpipes were made by John Dunn, and belonged to Robert Bewick. They have an inscription on the dronestock ferrule stating their provenance. It is likely that this simple chanter is not the original, which was probably keyed. a fine set by John Dunn, are now in the Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum. Matt Seattle published a small edition of some of the Bewick tunes in 1987, and a much expanded edition of this came out, with detailed notes, in 1998. In 2010 this was reissued in a new edition Bewick's Pipe Tunes, ed. Matt Seattle, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, 2010, by the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, with the addition of a revised version of Iain Bain's 1982 essay on Thomas and Robert Bewick and their connections with Northumbrian piping.

Within an eleven-year span, Freed played eight seasons in the minor leagues, with a \\"cup of coffee\\" in Major League Baseball with the Philadelphia Phillies during the 1942 season. He was officially listed as standing and weighing . Early life Freed was born on August 22, 1919, in Center Valley, Pennsylvania. Baseball career =Minor leagues: 1940-1942= Freed began his baseball career during the 1940 season in Trenton, New Jersey, playing for the class-B Trenton Senators at age 20. Under manager Goose Goslin, he batted .280 with 20 doubles, the second-highest total on the team. In the field, he played 110 games, making 212 putouts and 12 errors. The next year, Freed led Trenton with 124 games played and 136 hits. He was second on the team with 10 triples and third with 23 doubles. As a fielder, he reduced his number of errors to 5 and made 209 putouts. He moved to the Philadelphia Phillies-affiliated Trenton Packers in 1942, finishing second to Ed Murphy in at-bats (484), hits (120), doubles (15), triples (6), and home runs (3). He batted .248 and slugged .322 while playing in 131 games. He led all Packers outfielders in games played, putouts, and assists. After the conclusion of Trenton's season, Freed was called up to the Phillies. =Major league career and military service= Freed played his first game for Philadelphia on September 11, 1942, playing the full 11 innings of a contest against the Cincinnati Reds. In six plate appearances, he notched four hits in five official at-bats, including two doubles and a triple. Although Freed, batting second, was on base five times (with one walk in addition to his four hits), his two runs scored were part of a losing effort, as Cincinnati won the game, 8-5. He added to his hit total in his second game the following day, collecting two more hits in five at-bats against the Reds. After getting another hit against the St. Louis Cardinals in the second game of September 13's doubleheader, the Redbirds held Freed hitless in a pinch-hitting appearance the next day. He played both games of a September 16 doubleheader, going a combined 1-for-8 between the two contests. Freed's next three games were shutout losses for the Phillies, one each to the Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers, and New York Giants. His last major league hit came in the second game of a doubleheader against the Giants, an RBI single in a 9-1 Philadelphia victory. His final two games, both against Brooklyn, were hitless, leaving Freed with a final batting average of .303 for his brief major league career. After the season, Freed was called into military service working in a defense plant, and did not return to baseball until after the 1945 season. =Return to baseball= Freed returned to baseball in 1946, playing for manager Eddie Sawyer for the Utica Blue Sox. He batted .277 for Utica with seven doubles, one triple, and four home runs. He left affiliated baseball in 1947 to play three seasons for the class-B Rock Hill Chiefs. In his first year, he ranked third on the team in games played and at-bats, hitting 31 doubles, 5 triples, and 4 home runs. He batted .324, the team's best mark among fielders with more than 20 games played. The next year, he batted .303 for the Chiefs. In a team- high 558 at-bats, he reached double digits in all extra-base hit categories for the first time in his career, stroking 27 doubles, 13 triples, and 10 home runs, and reaching a slugging percentage of .452. His 148 hits in 1949 were again a team-best total--amassing him a .292 average--and 42 went for extra bases. He moved to the Charlotte Hornets, a Washington Senators affiliate, for the 1950 season, where he notched 25 extra-base hits in 440 at-bats in his final professional season. For his minor league career, Freed finished with a .288 batting average and 1,038 hits, including 172 doubles, 49 triples and 37 home runs.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 3 September 2019  Priesthood  In April 1658, inspired by the example of his uncle Claudio Acquaviva who later became the 5th General of the Jesuits, he too joined the Society of Jesus. He became a novice at Sant'Andrea al Quirinale in Rome together with Stanislas Kostka. After completing his studies Acquaviva was chosen by his superiors for the prestigious and challenging Indian missions, begun by Francis Xavier in the Portuguese territory of Goa. He then travelled to Lisbon, starting point for the voyage east. There he was ordained a priest and sailed for India in 1578.  At Akbar's Court  At first he taught at Saint Paul's College, Goa but was then assigned as the leader of a mission to the court of the Grand Mughal Akbar (1542‚Äì1605) who had requested missionaries be sent.Nickel, Gordon, ‚ÄúRodolfo Acquaviva‚Äù, Christian-Muslim Relations 1500 - 1900, (David Thomas, ed.) 2015 In his new palace in Fatehpur Sikri Akbar built the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) where he invited leaders of the Muslim, Hindu and other religions to debate points of religious truth, including Acquaviva and his companion Jesuit Ant√≥nio de Monserrate (Antoni de Montserrat in his native Catalan), and their young translator, Francisco Henriques, who spoke Persian. Akbar was interested in founding a new pantheistic religion with elements from different traditions and his new faith was called Din-i- Ilahi (\\"Faith of the Divine\\"). Although Acquaviva came equipped with the Bible translated into many different languages, (though not yet Persian) and was the object of Akbar's sympathetic personal attention, the Jesuit felt his efforts were fruitless, one obstacle being the ruler's repugnance to monogamy, and after three years, decided to withdraw, though other Jesuits maintained the mission at the courts of the Mughal Emperors and in Agra for the next two centuries.  Martyrdom  A 17th-century painting in a church in Colva depicting the massacre of the five Jesuits in Cuncolim, Goa on 25 July 1583. Acquaviva in the center uncovering his neck. Upon his return to Goa as part of his missionary commitments he led a mission to the Hindu Kshatriyas of Salcette, south of Goa. This was seen as a provocation by the local community some of whose temples had already been destroyed by Jesuits and Portuguese troops. It incited the Cuncolim Revolt of July, 1583. Acquaviva was murdered opening his collar to the scimitar of his assassin and calling to God.  Beatification  He and his four Jesuit companions were beatified by pope Leo XIII in 1893. He is commemorated with others by the Jesuits under the title \\"Martyrs of the Missions\\" on Feb 4.http://jesuitinstitute.org/Pages/Liturgy/Calendar.htm References Sources *Daniello Bartoli, Missione al Gran Mogor del p.

As a boy, Bethards played at the Christian Street YMCA along with Charles \\"Tarzan\\" Cooper, Zack Clayton, and Bill Yancey. There they began four fruitful careers on a squad called the Tribune Men. \\"Clown Prince of Basketball\\" As early as 1927, playing alongside \\"Stretch\\" Cooper for the Philadelphia Scholastics, Bethards was reported to have been \\"the sensation while in New England\\" by the Baltimore Afro-American. Six years later, playing alongside Clayton and Yancey for the Philadelphia Giants in another New England swing, Jackie reportedly entered a contest in the 2nd quarter with the Giants on the wrong side of a 20-7 score and, described as \\"unquestionably one of the best semi-pro players in the business,\\" proceeded to hit \\"long shot after long shot\\" to tighten the game. Following a Clayton fielder that brought the Giants to within a point, Bethards \\"let a long shot fly that registered the winning digits\\" in a 32-31 win over the St Joseph's Polish Hearts. By 1933 Jackie Bethards was commonly called the \\"Clown Prince of basketball\\", a label that came to be identified with the Harlem Globetrotters' biggest names like Goose Tatum and Meadowlark Lemon. Within a year the nickname of \\"Clown Prince\\" had followed Bethards to Chicago, whence he starred for the Savoy Big Five (also known as the Chicago Crusaders) along with such teammates as Jack Mann, Clayton, and Billy Yancey's brother John Yancey. New York Rens Following his successful foray as a Chicagoan Jackie Bethards reunited with Bill Yancey and Tarzan Cooper on the New York Rens. Along with David \\"Big Dave\\" DeJernett Bethards received top billing as a new Rens' star for the fabled team that had recently suffered the loss of sharpshooter Pappy Ricks. According to the Sheboygan Press, \\"Jack 'Rabbit' Bethards and 'Wee Willie' Smith play(ed) the leading roles in the comedy as they clown and burlesque with players and fans as well.\\" While he undeniably was a star with the Rens, earning the moniker \\"ShowBoat,\\" Bethards only played for the club in 1935-36 and 1936‚Äì37, before being replaced in a sense by high school-to-pros phenom Johnny Isaacs. Bethards clearly kept good relations with Tarzan Cooper. Cooper once described a memorable 4th-quarter duel in 1928 between Bethards, playing for the Philadelphia Giants, and the Rens' star guard Clarence \\"Fats\\" Jenkins, saying \\"We gave the ball to Jackie. Fats, a master at the art of freezing, tried to take the ball away from him. I will never forget the things Jackie pulled...and he kept the ball in his possession for three minutes, kept it away from one of the greatest players the game has ever known\\". en route to the Giants' tense 31-29 win over the Rens in Boston. The following year, in 1929, the outcome was similar: \\"Gorilla\\" Bethards was described as the Giants' brightest star, his \\"humorous antics\\" keeping the crowd on edge and his \\"all-around playing ability on a level with the best in the business\\" as the Giants again beat the NY Rens in Boston, 25-23. For one of Bethards' last performances as a Ren in 1937, the story ran, \\"Jack Bethards, Ren forward, had the fans in thunderous applause every minute he was in the game, putting on a great basketball exhibition. He was by far the fastest man on the floor, and his handling of the ball was uncanny\\" to spark the Rens' 51-38 win over the Art Imigs (later the Sheboygan Redskins of the NBA). Style That same year the Chicago Defender's Dan Burley wrote in his trademark homey fashion: \\"Influence of Bethards' style of basketball playing was shown in the Gladiator/Rival Dog Food clash at the Armory. George Darden, Red Bolton, an' others on th' team are perfecting th' clown formulations to a nicety.\\". Two days after Burley's column appeared the Sheboygan Press again weighed in, saying \\"The clown of the Rens is Jackie Bethards, who travels around the floor so fast fans only see a dark streak flitting about the court. A showman through and through, Jackie drives his opponents crazy with his speed and antics on the floor. A great shot, Bethards is content to thrill the fans with his speed and ball handling, leaving the scoring end of the game to the rest of his mates.\\". When the Harlem Globetrotters came to Lowell, Massachusetts in 1949 fresh from wins over both the Boston Celtics and Minneapolis Lakers, Jackie Bethards' comedic influence was recalled: \\"The last time a team appeared in Lowell the likes of this club was when the Sacred Heart team had the famous Philadelphia Colored Giants in town featuring the great 'Gorilla' Bethards. The big interest will be in the trick style of ball the visitors play.\\" Washington Bears Whether he parted company with the Rens for stylistic or other reasons, for several seasons after 1937 little is known of Bethards' playing career until he resurfaced in 1942 joining John Isaacs, Cooper and Clayton on the Philadelphia Toppers in games against the Detroit Clowns and Long Island Pros. In 1942-43 Bethards also played alongside Tarzan Cooper and several other ex-NY Rens for the Washington Bears club that won the World's Pro Championship tourney in Chicago. True to reputation, Bethards was credited with freezing the ball to clinch the Bears' 27th consecutive win in a January 1943 match against the New York Clippers that ended 36-29. For several years afterwards both Bethards and Tarzan Cooper remained associated with the Washington Bears until the fall of 1946, when Bears' owner AE Lichtman retired. Cooper, billing Bethards as one of his stars, started another team called the \\"Bears\\" back in Philadelphia but was threatened with lawsuit by the Washington Bears' new owner Harold Jackson for forging the team name. Jackson appealed to NBL commissioner Ward \\"Piggy\\" Lambert so that the National league would not book the Cooper/Bethards team for games. That is where Jackie Bethards' pro basketball playing career apparently ended, after two decades of competition. In 1960 Philadelphia native Wilt Chamberlain announced he was fed up with the NBA and would retire after his rookie season. Comparing Wilt to the Philly pro pioneers, the Fitchburg (MA) Sentinel editorialized: \\"The stars of the New York Rens and Philadelphia Colored Giants were that incomparable clown Jackie Bethards, a one-man predecessor to the Harlem Globetrotters, and Zack Clayton and Tarzan Cooper, remember? We certainly don't wish to insinuate that the \\"Stilt\\" should be forced to undergo indignities of any kind, but neither do we feel that Bethards, Clayton, or Cooper would have hustled for cover as Wilt obviously has if his retirement is on the level. The major difference between then and now is that Chamberlain has somewhere to hide‚Äîback with the successful Globetrotters or as the backbone of a new major league‚Äîwhile the other poor guys merely headed dog-tired into the next town.\\".

Compiler The IBM XL compilers are built from modularized components consisting of front ends (for different programming languages), a platform agnostic high level optimizer, and platform-specific low-level optimizers/code generators to target specific hardware and operating systems. The XL C/C++ compilers target POWER, BlueGene/Q, and z Systems hardware architectures. A common high level optimizer across the POWER and z/OS XL C/C++z/OS XL C/C++ compilers optimizes the source program using platform-agnostic optimizations such as interprocedural analysis, profile- directed feedback, and loop and vector optimizations. A low-level optimizer on each platform performs function-level optimizations, and generates optimized code for a specific operating system and hardware platform. The particular optimizations performed for any given compilation depend upon the optimization level chosen under option control (O2 to O5) along with any other optimization-related options, such as those for interprocedural analysis or loop optimizations. A 60-day installable evaluation version is available for download for the AIX,XL C/C++ for AIX Linux on Power and XL C/C++ for Linux on Power. In June 2016, IBM introduced XL C/C++ for Linux Community Edition which is free of charge. It can be downloaded.XL C/C++ for Linux Community Edition The XL compilers on AIX have delivered leadership scores in the SPEC CPU2000 and CPU2006 benchmarks, in combination with specific IBM POWER system processor announcements, for example SPEC CPU2006 Floating PointCPU2006 Floating Point score of 71.5 in May 2010 and SPEC CPU2000 Floating Point score of 4051 in August 2006. Current (2016) versions of the XL C/C++ compilers support a subset of the C++03 standard on AIX; while XL C/C++ for Linux (Power) v13.1.3 supports C++11. The XL C/C++ compiler for Linux on Power little endian edition, released in December 2014, is based on the open source Clang front end (part of the Clang/LLVM open source project) and therefore provides a higher level of language and GCC compatibility than IBM C/C++ compilers on other platforms, although that support is a subset of what Clang/LLVM itself supports. The z/OS XL C/C++ compiler exploits the latest IBM Z¬Æ systems, including the latest IBM z14¬Æ servers. It enables development of high-performing business applications and system programs on z/OS, while maximizing hardware use and improving application performance. IBM z/OS XL C/C++ uses services provided by the z/OS Language Environment¬Æ and Runtime Library Extensions base elements. It supports embedded CICS¬Æ and SQL statements in C/C++ source, which simplifies the operation of C/C++ within CICS and DB2¬Æ environments.

First flown in 1919, it achieved modest sales at home and abroad in the early 1920s. Two unusual modifications produced a biplane glider and a low aspect ratio parasol wing machine. Design and development Generally known as the Sport, Farman's post World War I light biplane tourer carried the maker's designation FF 65. FF stood for Farman fr√©res and the FF 65 was one of only two Farman aircraft to use it; it distinguished the Sport from the F 65, its very large airliner contemporary, one of the Farman Goliath series. The prototype was named the David to contrast this small aircraft with the Goliath and this name is sometimes used for the type. The Sport was a single bay biplane with staggered wings of equal span and rectangular plan. There were outboard ailerons on the upper planes only. The interplane struts were of N-shape and the centre section was supported by two pairs of vertical struts from the fuselage. The fuselage was a rectangular structure with four longerons interconnected by vertical and diagonal braces skinned in 3-ply wood. An open cockpit began just aft of the first pair of centre section struts, with two low seats in tandem, spaced so closely together that the passenger's feet surrounded the pilot. At the rear, the tailplane was attached to the top of the fuselage and wire braced to the rudder post. This latter carried a tall rudder with a curved top which extended to the bottom of the fuselage, moving in a gap between the elevators; there was no fixed fin. It had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with its main wheels on a single axle mounted on V struts to the lower longerons. David was powered by a Le Rh√¥ne 9Z rotary engine, neatly enclosed within an aluminium cowling and driving a two blade propeller. It underwent official testing early in 1920 at Villacoublay. Sports fitted with extended upper wings gained first and second prizes at a speed range competition that year. The production version, first displayed in September 1921 in Brussels, gained its certificate that December. It was powered by an Anzani 6Bbis two row radial. This engine was fitted with its cylinder heads exposed for cooling. In 1922 the Sport was modified to compete in the first French national gliding competition. Modifications had to be made to accommodate the change in centre of gravity once the engine had been removed and the unusual biplane glider had a lengthened nose and wings without stagger, the upper plane moved rearwards. The wing span was increased by and the N-form interplane struts were replaced by parallel pairs. Another seriously modified Sport appeared in 1926 when Farman fitted a F 65 with a new, monoplane parasol wing. This rectangular plan wing, with a span of and a chord of was built out a portion of the wing of a Goliath airliner. The original Sport centre section struts were retained but new streamlined lift struts, two on each side, took the forces from the high wing to the lower fuselage longerons. Because of the low aspect ratio of its wing (2.6) the new machine acquired the nickname the Flying Postcard. Formally, it remained a Sport. It was designed for, and entered into, the Zenith Cup fuel consumption competition of 1926. Farman did win this Cup, though not with the Sport but with their F.91. The Farman F 209 began as a Sport which had been in the Farman store from 1924 to 1931. When it finally flew again in 1933 its structure had been revised and modified, though details are sparse. There were no changes to the major dimensions. Operational history 34 production aircraft were built, several of which were exported. Wallace Kennett established a US agency in Kansas City and imported about 10 Sports. Others were sold into Canada, Australia and Spain. The Sport took part in several competitions to promote the brand. It had an early success in Brussels in September 1921, where Bossoutrot won the Simonet Cup. In May 1922 he was at Le Bourget and was runner-up in the \\"quick getaway\\" competition. A Sport was present, if not competing at the 1923 St Louis Air Race Meeting and another took part in the 1924 \\"On to Dayton\\" race, which involved flying over the Allegheny Mountains. In August 1922 the first national French glider meeting, the Congrƒós exp√©rimental d'aviation sans moteur, organised by the Association of French Flyers (AFF) and partly government funded, was held in Combegrasse, Puy-de-D√¥me. Farman entered two aircraft, the de-motorised Sport and an Aviette glider; overall there were 17 contestants. The Sport was much less successful than the Aviette, making only a few take-offs. Charles Townsend Ludington formed the Ludington Exhibition Company in 1923 and used a custom built Farman Sport airplane for demonstration aerial displays.

Warren had been in failing health for many years when he died at the age of 80. Early life Warren was born in Carrizo Springs, Texas, USA. He was married to the former Faye C. Brauer (1921‚Äì2001) in 1941. They had three children. Warren served in the United States Air Force as an aerial navigator in World War II. Education Warren received a B.S. in mathematics from Abilene Christian College, the M.A. in religion from the University of Houston, and the M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from Vanderbilt University. His dissertation topic foreshadowed his long-time interest in apologetics: God and Evil: Does Judeo-Christian Theism Involve a Logical Contradiction? Teaching career Warren taught mathematics and Bible at Abilene Christian College, Abilene, Texas, USA during the 1946-47 academic year. From 1959-61 he chaired the Department of Bible at Fort Worth Christian College where he also served as President. At Freed-Hardeman College in Henderson, Tennessee, USA, Warren chaired the Department of Bible from 1964-1971. His most fruitful academic appointment was as Professor of Philosophy of Religion and Apologetics at Harding Graduate School of Religion, where he served from 1971-79. He was co- founder and Dean of the Graduate School and Professor of Philosophy and Christian Doctrine and Apologetics at Tennessee Bible College in Cookeville, Tennessee, USA. In addition, Warren served as minister of several Churches of Christ throughout his career. Philosophical research and debates Warren's earliest published work in philosophy was modified from the final chapter of his Vanderbilt University dissertation and was published in 1972. In Have Atheists Proved There is No God?, Warren develops a version of a soul-making theodicy to answer J. L. Mackie's argument from evil against theism. Warren's chief claim to fame outside the Churches of Christ are his debates with Antony Flew and Wallace Matson on the existence of God, and his debate with Joe E. Barnhart on the adequacy of utilitarian ethics. The debate with Flew, a major proponent of atheism famous for his argument that theism is not falsifiable, was held at North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) in Denton, Texas, USA from September 20‚Äì23, 1976. This was an exceptionally well attended debate, and Flew describes it as the best attended of his many debates with theists on the existence of God, with audiences each night ranging from 5,000-7,000 people. The Warren-Matson Debate took place in Tampa, Florida, USA from September 11‚Äì14, 1978. Matson, a professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley was, like Flew, a long-time proponent of atheism. The Warren-Barnhart Debate took place at North Texas State University on November 3‚Äì6, 1980. Barnhart has retired as Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Texas. Philosophical views Warren was a strong evidentialist on the issue of God's existence. He believed that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt for the existence of God. In his two debates on the existence of God, Warren prefers versions of the Teleological Argument for the existence of God, using (in his debate with Flew) the alveoli in the lungs and the process of oxygen/carbon dioxide exchange as proof for an intelligent designer; in his debate with Matson, he used the circulatory system. Warren was also known for his logical traps, for example, his challenge to Flew to answer the question, \\"Which came first, a human mother or a human baby?\\" Flew struggled to answer Warren's question; however, Matson replied with, \\"When did Latin become French,\\" arguing that in biological evolution, as in language, there are times when it is difficult to assign a language (or a life form) into a specific category. In his theological writings, especially in his articles in the magazine he edited, The Spiritual Sword, Warren argued that specific Christian beliefs, such as the resurrection of Christ and the inspiration of the Bible, could be proved by natural reason. Involvement in theological controversy In the context of the Churches of Christ and the Restoration Movement, Warren was a strict restorationist: he believed that the noninstrumental Churches of Christ followed the strict New Testament pattern of Christian doctrine, worship, and practice. He held that any deviation from that pattern by a church would exclude it from being part of the Christian community. Warren consistently argued that members of the noninstrumental Churches of Christ are \\"the only Christians.\\" This put Warren at odds with more liberal leaders in the Churches of Christ such as Rubel Shelly, who argued that members of Christian bodies outside the Churches of Christ could also be Christians. Warren also staunchly defended the traditional hermeneutic of the Churches of Christ: that only direct commands from the Bible, apostolic examples, or necessary (deductive) inferences from direct commands and examples were authoritative for Christians. This hermeneutic was consistent with Warren's strong epistemological rationalism. Another area of controversy in Churches of Christ in which Warren played a role was the issue of divorce and remarriage. Warren's position was that a divorced individual could only be remarried if (1) the divorce was due to adultery, and (2) the individual desiring a second marriage was the innocent partner in the first marriage. Unless these two conditions were fulfilled, the remarried individual was not truly remarried, but \\"living in adultery.\\" The proper action, according to Warren, for that person is to return to his or her first spouse. Legacy Thomas B. Warren was one of the first trained philosophers to teach at colleges associated with churches of Christ. His debate with Flew on the existence of God is still known in many Fundamentalist and Evangelical Christian circles. He was an influential figure in the Churches of Christ from the 1940s through the early 1980s. Many of his writings are still required reading material among churches of Christ. Warren's influence remains strong. After Warren's death, a number of his former students and others influenced by his thought worked to establish a center in Christian apologetics. It is currently in the planning stages and will be built in Vienna, West Virginia, USA. Selected writings Christians Only and the Only Christians'. Jonesboro: National Christian Press, 1986.

The Qu√©bec City St-Patrick's Day Parade is the main event celebrating Saint Patrick's Day in Qu√©bec City. The event returned in 2010 after 84 years' absence. History =Origins (1837-1926)= Canada's first-known celebration of St. Patrick's Day was held in Qu√©bec City in 1765 in the Sun Tavern on St. John Street (today known as rue St-Jean). It was hosted by Protestant landlord Miles Prentice, a former soldier (and believed to be an Irishman), and by the former Provost-Marshal in General Wolfe's army. Qu√©bec City's first parade was held in 1837, four years after the opening of the Irish community's first church, St. Patrick's, on rue McMahon. The parade attracted a large number of people and quickly became a major annual event in Qu√©bec City. In 1916, the parade was suspended due to World War I, resuming in 1921. In 1928, two years after the last parade, the Qu√©bec Chronicle Telegraph acknowledged with regret that the festivity had begun its passage into history. However, the Cadets of St. Patrick's High School held modest parades until the 1940s. =The return of the parade (2010- )= In 2009, a committee was created to bring back the tradition of the parade to the city.

It is an especially prominent commercial practice in developing nations, which often approach licensed production as a starting point for indigenous industrial development. While licensed production provides stimulus to the production and technical capabilities of local industry, in many cases it remains at least partly dependent on foreign support.  History  An example of global licensing agreements: countries which have purchased licenses to manufacture arms and ammunition are depicted in blue. The four most common applications of licensed production have historically been automotive engines and parts, weaponry, aircraft, and pharmaceuticals. During World War I, it was more common for licensing agreements to take place between companies in the same country; for example, Opel was granted a license to produce BMW-designed aircraft engines for the German war effort. During the 1920s, European economists began advocating licensed production of foreign goods as the cure for \\"industrial particularism\\"--it allowed countries to bypass the costly research and development stage of acquiring products with which their own industries were unfamiliar, and refocus on the domestic manufacture of preexisting overseas designs. This allowed for a much higher rate of production, and was considerably cheaper than national sourcing and off-the-shelf acquisition. European automobile manufacturers were the first to adopt this practice, producing a number of specialized American components for their passenger cars under license. The United States not only supplied European factories with the necessary blueprints and licenses, but also sourced American-made tooling equipment accordingly, which allowed the automobile companies to optimize their production lines. By the 1960s it was not uncommon for an entire specialized industry--such as the manufacture of helicopters in the United Kingdom--to be dependent wholly on licensed components. A number of countries began improving products manufactured under license, and were even able to re-export them successfully. This trend resulted in some technology suppliers imposing additional conditions on the licensee. The United States began inserting pro forma statements into licensing agreements known as \\"side letters\\", which required the free sharing of any improvements made to American technology. Other attempts were also made to control the destination of licensed products, particularly with regards to the arms industry. For instance, France stipulated that Eland armoured vehicles manufactured in South Africa under a French license were not to be exported to other foreign powers without its express approval. Yet another form of common licensing restriction related solely to the licensing activity, regulating whether the specified product was fully produced or partly assembled, and whether entire products or their individual components were manufactured. In some cases, the original technology supplier did not need to manufacture the product itself--it merely patented a specific design, then sold the actual production rights to multiple overseas clients. This resulted in some countries producing separate but nearly identical products under different licenses. Developing nations began accounting for a significant percentage of licensed production during the late twentieth century. Governments of developing nations often sought to encourage rapid industrialization, reduce dependence on foreign imports, and combat high levels of unemployment by creating and retaining local jobs. However, indigenous companies were often too small and their research capacity too limited to meet these goals alone, compelling them to adopt licensing agreements. Manufacturing non-national products under license generated employment and empowered the industry while reducing dependence on imports. It also avoided the risks inherent in the development of new products without adequate research infrastructure by taking advantage of consumer goods already proven in foreign markets. Several developing nations such as Pakistan and Singapore which built important segments of their industry on licensed production have now become licensors themselves to less developed states. Theoretical basis 1933 Fiat 508 manufactured under license in Poland by Polski Fiat. Licensed production is defined as an overseas production arrangement, usually as a direct result of inter-state trade agreements, that permits a foreign government or entity to acquire the technical information to manufacture all or part of an equipment or component patented in the exporting country. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), it must constitute a partnership between an intellectual property owner and a licensee who is authorized to use such rights under certain conditions. The licensee is manufacturing a product for which it has been granted production rights under specific conditions, while the licensor retains ownership of the intellectual property thereof. In some cases the licensor will supply the necessary technical data, prototypes, and/or machine tools to the licensee. While licensed production is often dependent on the appropriate technology transfers, it does not necessarily entail ownership and management of the overseas production by the technology supplier. However, the licensor does retain the right to continue to use the licensed property, and to attribute further licenses to third parties. Occasionally, licensees may themselves sub- license a third party with or without the agreement of the intellectual property owner. Licensing agreements determine the form and scope of compensation to the intellectual property owner, which usually takes the form of a flat licensing fee or a running royalty payment derived from a share of the licensee's revenue. The licenses can be terminated by the licensor, or may expire after a set date; however, the technology and knowledge, once transferred, cannot be rescinded, so even if the licensing agreement expires they remain in the licensee's possession. Two related commercial practices are foreign subcontractor production and the proliferation of knock-down kits. Foreign subcontracting occurs when a product's original manufacturer contracts the production of its individual parts and components to a second party overseas. Such arrangements are not considered examples of licensed production because they do not involve the explicit licensing of technological information. Knock-down kits are regarded as a prerequisite to licensed production; they consist of products assembled locally from imported, pre- manufactured parts. Quality control and unlicensed production Some licensors find it difficult to regulate the quality of their products manufactured under license. It is not always made clear to consumers where exactly a particular good originated, and a poor quality licensed product may damage the reputation of the original licensor. However, this is not considered a form of consumer fraud unless the product is unlicensed or counterfeit. Unlicensed production is the utilization of foreign manufacturing technology without a license, achieved through industrial espionage or reverse engineering. Products in high demand on the international market can be reproduced, based on the same or similar design, and branded in ways to make them indistinguishable from the original. When copied and reproduced without a license, certain items are sometimes recopied in a similar manner by a third party. The manufacturers responsible may also grant legitimately registered sub-licenses for their unlicensed products, profiting at the expense of the real intellectual property owner. The quality of unlicensed goods varies greatly; the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has noted that while licensing companies often provide quality control measures, and there is some incentive for licensees to comply or risk legal action and the ensuing damage to their own profit, manufacturers who engage in unlicensed production are under no such obligations. Another method of circumventing the need for a license involves a manufacturer making slight modifications in the design or function of an existing product, before reproducing it. The manufacturer could then argue that the resulting product is not an unlicensed copy, but a new product not subject to license.  Examples  Industrial products which have been built under license include: *The Belgian FN FAL battle rifle by FN Herstal, produced under license in fifteen countries. *The German G3 battle rifle by Heckler & Koch, produced under license in eighteen countries. *The Italian Aermacchi MB-326 trainer aircraft, produced under license in Brazil and South Africa. *The British Folland Gnat trainer aircraft, produced under license in India. *The American Northrop F-5 light fighter aircraft, produced under license in Taiwan. *The Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 multirole fighter aircraft, produced under license in India. *The American General Dynamics F-16 multirole fighter aircraft, produced under license in South Korea. *The British Canberra bomber aircraft, produced under license in the United States as the Martin B-57 Canberra. *The French A√©rospatiale Alouette III helicopter, produced under license in Romania, Switzerland, and India. *The American Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopter, produced under license in Germany, Japan, and Italy. *The French Panhard AML armored car, produced under license in South Africa as the Eland Mk7. *The French CM60A1 mortar, produced under license in South Africa. *The Italian Fiat 125 passenger car, produced under license in Poland as the Polski Fiat 125p. *The Soviet GAZ-M20 Pobeda sedan, produced under license in Poland as the FSO Warszawa.

Headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, with secondary corporate offices in Atlanta, Georgia and Charlotte, North Carolina, at its peak the bank operated more than 30 retail branches in The Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia. CertusBank, N.A. was a subsidiary of CertusHoldings, Inc. (formerly Blue Ridge Holdings, Inc.) headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and was created by former executives from Bank of America and Wachovia. The bank elected to go into liquidation in 2015. Creditors sued, and accepted a final settlement in 2017. CertusBank was the result of the combination of several acquisitions since 2011, including CommunitySouth Bank and Trust of Easley, South Carolina; Atlantic Southern Bank of Macon, Georgia; and First Georgia Banking Company of Franklin, Georgia. Subsequent CertusBank acquisitions included Charlotte, North Carolina-based Myers Park Mortgage, Inc.; Hometown Community Bank of Braselton, Georgia; Quadrant Financial, Inc. of Savannah, Georgia; Resource Financial Services of Columbia, South Carolina; and Parkway Bank of Lenoir, North Carolina. The company engaged in various lending and banking practices: retail banking, consumer lending, wholesale banking, wealth management, and mortgage lending. History CertusBank was founded by Angela Webb, Walter Davis, Milton Jones Jr and Charles Williams who served in various leadership roles. In 2010, CertusHoldings received a shelf charter from the Comptroller of the Currency and raised $500 million from investors. On January 21, 2011, the new CertusBank bought the failed CommunitySouth Bank & Trust of Easley, South Carolina, whose six branches reopened as CertusBank the next day.

The plot is loosely based on another film, In Bed. Room in Rome was Julio Medem's first English language film. Plot During the first day of the summer in June, Alba (Elena Anaya), a 30-something Spanish tourist in Rome, brings a younger Russian woman Natasha (Natasha Yarovenko) to her hotel room during both of their last night of vacation in Rome. The details of how they met in a nightclub are left vague. Once in the room, Natasha is at first quite reluctant, insisting she's straight, but the clearly more experienced Alba handles deftly around Natasha's hesitance. Flattered and tempted by Alba, Natasha responds to her sexual advances, but continues to maintain that she is straight and has never had sex with a woman. Alba counters by claiming that she is a lesbian and has never had sex with a man. Alba and Natasha first get undressed and into bed, but Natasha is still very nervous. Alba suggests that they first lay side by side and only casually touch each other's faces. They do so until Alba becomes so relaxed that she falls asleep. Natasha quietly gets out of bed, gets dressed and leaves the room, wondering what would have happened if she stayed and consummated her curiosity and attraction to Alba. In her rush to leave, Natasha leaves her cell phone behind, and the ring-tone wakes up Alba. Natasha soon returns and asks Alba for her cell phone, but is reluctant to enter the room again. When a passing night-shift waiter named Max passes by, Alba grabs Natasha and takes her back into the room. While talking about the location of Natasha's hotel and looking at an old map of Rome from the 1st century, Alba continues to flirt with Natasha with her naked body. Natasha soon succumbs to her attraction and curiosity towards Alba, leading her to quickly get undressed once again and into bed where she and Alba have sex for the first time. Over the next 10 hours, Alba and Natasha grow closer to each other as Natasha becomes more relaxed and comfortable around Alba with their lovemaking. Alba and Natasha share stories, periodically stopping to illustrate their points with pictures on the Internet, talk about the artwork in the hotel room, and explore each other's nude bodies through sex. Alba first tells a story about how her mother abandoned her when she was a little girl and she ended up as the kept woman of a wealthy Arab in Saudi Arabia, while Natasha later shares a story of her abusive father and her twin sister's career as an art historian. Eventually, the two women tell each other the truth. Natasha reveals that her real name is Dasha who comes from a wealthy family living near Moscow and that she is actually a professional tennis player on vacation, and is to be married the following week in Russia to a man. Natasha's twin sister, Sasha, a model and career actress, phones her at least twice during the film to ask of her whereabouts and wedding plans. Alba then reveals that she is actually a mechanical engineer/inventor in Rome on business and she lives with a woman in San Sebastian, Spain. Alba shows Natasha a video of herself and her life partner, named Edurne, who have two small children, a little boy and girl, and who are of Basque origin. Alba also says that the little boy died recently in a drowning accident. Natasha and Alba have breakfast together at dawn, which is served by the cheerful room service waiter, Max. They discuss abandoning their partners and living together in Rome, but both seem to realize that this is not possible. While Alba tells Natasha that she feels she is falling in love with her, Natasha gets more defensive and insists that her attraction to Alba only stems from curiosity towards the same sex, but not through love. After having sex a final time and then hanging the white bed sheet up a flagpole on the balcony of the room as a gag, the two one-time lovers eventually decide to part ways, returning to their previous lives in Russia and Spain. They both agree to let the passionate night they shared remain a secret between them. In the final shot, after leaving the hotel and walking away from each other, Natasha calls out to Alba and runs towards her to show off her sprint running skills... leaving their parting ambiguous to if they will ever meet again. Production The film was shot almost entirely on a sound stage in Madrid, Spain as the hotel room setup. The location of the hotel in the film is an empty square called Piazzetta di San Simeone, the same square used in opening and closing shots of the film. Principal photography took place in Rome and Madrid from 26 January to 27 February 2009.

Landis as a transition team analysis of the United States' administrative agencies for incoming President John F. Kennedy on December 21, 1960. A long-time friend of the Kennedy family, Landis served as a legal advisor to Joseph P. Kennedy and was President Kennedy's Special Counsel. At the time of the report, Landis was on the faculty of Harvard Law School. The report recommended greater clarity on the roles and authority of agency chairs. The Kennedy Administration adopted many of the report's recommendations. Summary The report reviewed the overall state of United States administrative law and the relationship between the independent agencies and the executive branch. Landis expressed a concern for the backlog in administrative law cases and the cost of participating in administrative hearings. The report expressed concerns about ethic of administrative proceedings, including extensive ex parte communications.Report at p. 11 Administrative Conference of the United States A major recommendation of the Landis Report was the establishment of the Administrative Conference of the United States, which is a permanent agency to study Federal administrative procedures and develop recommendations for improvement. Similar recommendations were made during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations.Memorandum Convening the President's Commission on Administrative Procedure, Public Papers 219-22 (Apr. 29, 1953); Executive Order 10934, 26 Fed. Reg. 3233 (Apr. 13, 1961). In addition, the Landis Report recommended that legislation be adopted to establish a permanent agency. Such legislation was adopted in 1964 after President Kennedy's death.Administrative Conference Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-499, 5 USC 591-596. Power of agency chairs Many federal administrative agencies have multiple members and operate as collegial bodies with one member designated as chairman. The report noted that before World War II, the main role of an agency chair was to preside at meetings, and agencies frequently rotated the chair duties among members annually.Landis Report at 11. However, under post-World War II reorganization plans, the President was given the responsibility to designate the chair from among the agency's commissioners, and the chair was given the power to set the internal organization and policy direction of the agency. Landis noted that most chairs did not exercise this added authority, leaving the leadership of the agency to group decision making. Landis recommended that the reorganization plans for the Federal Power Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission be amended to make the chair of each agency serve at the pleasure of the President.Landis Report at 60. Landis also recommended that the plans for the administrative agencies clarify that the chair sets the budget, allocates funds and appoints the staff.

Geography  The bridge connects the island of Hisingen with the main land of Gothenburg between Nils Ericssongatan and Hjalmar Brantningsgatan on Hisingen. The bridge crosses the river just east of Lilla Bommen on the mainland side and just east of Freeport on the Hisingen side.G√∂teborg, Partille och M√∂lndals Gatukalender, Otto Asphem, G√∂teborg 1979. Avsnitt \\"G\\".  History  As far back as the 1870s, there were discussions about a high bridge in Majorna, from Bangatan to Skat Mountain in Lindholmen. In 1904, it was proposed to build a tunnel between the Lilla Bommen and Tingstadsvassen. After the decision that the old bridge of Hisingen would be replaced, the choice was between a new bridge or a tunnel. A principle decision was taken in 1933 on what would become a \\"G√∂ta√§lvbro\\" and the question was consequently put on hold for some time. Preparatory ground works began in November 1935. The bridge is used by motor vehicles, trams, bicycles and pedestrians. The bridge cost 8.2 million Swedish kronor (SEK) to construct, of which the state contributed 25%. With access points included the final cost were 13 million SEK.G√∂teborgs kanaler och broar ber√§ttar, Bengt A. √ñhnander, Tre B√∂cker F√∂rlag AB, G√∂teborg 2007 s.80-81 The bridge was built mainly by Germans and was inaugurated on 26November 1939 by Communications Minister Gerhard Strindlund, in the presence of representatives of port authorities from Oslo, Copenhagen and Helsinki.Kronologiska anteckningar om viktigare h√§ndelser i G√∂teborg 1619-1982, Agne Rundqvist, Ralf Scander, Anders Both√©n, Elof Lind√§lv, utgiven av G√∂teborgs hembygdsf√∂rbund 1982 s. 107 At the time, the bridge was only four-lane, but was later expanded by one lane and walking and cycle tracks on each side. Until 1968, the heavy transit traffic of the E6 highway used the bridge, but even in 2016, the bridge is the most important connection primarily for local traffic and public transport between central Gothenburg and Hisingen even with the presence of √Ñlvsborgsbron, Tingstadstunneln and Angeredsbron.

She studied art in the United States and Europe. She made portraits of Pueblo Native Americans, desert landscapes and still lifes. Pelton's work evolved through at least three distinct themes: her early \\"Imaginative Paintings,\\" art of the American Southwest people and landscape, and abstract art that reflected her spiritual beliefs. Early life Agnes Lawrence Pelton was born in Stuttgart, Germany to American parents, William and Florence Pelton. She lived in Rotterdam, the Netherlands from 1882 to 1884 and in Basel, Switzerland from 1884 to 1888. In 1888, Agnes and her mother moved to Elizabeth Tilton's home in Brooklyn, New York, located at 1403 Pacific Street. Agnes' father tragically died of a morphine overdose May 23, 1891, at his brother's home in Louisiana. Florence Pelton studied music at the Stuttgart Conservatory of Music and operated the Pelton School of Music, from the family home, in Brooklyn for 30 years. She also gave lessons in French and German.Blankenship, Women Artists of the American West. Due to her poor health, Agnes was educated at home and her mother and Arthur Whiting taught her piano. Education Pelton studied at the Pratt Institute from 1895 to 1900, graduating with fellow Modernist artist Max Weber. She continued her studies with one of her instructors, Arthur Wesley Dow, in Ipswich, Massachusetts. She studied landscape and was Dow's assistant at his summer school, where he taught Modernism, inspired by Chinese and Japanese art. Biographer Tiska Blankenship said that \\"Dow emphasized structure, spirit, imagination, creation, and the nonnaturalistic use of color, a technique he taught using Japanese prints to demonstrate space relations and the appropriate use of light and dark masses... Dow's influence was critical to Pelton's development of abstractions based on interior, spiritual values.\\" Dow also taught Georgia O'Keeffe. Pelton took summer classes from William Langson Lathrop in 1907. Pelton studied in Italy in 1910 and 1911, taking life drawing lessons and studying Italian painters at the British Academy in Rome, and also studied with Hamilton Easter Field,Severson, 2002. who was another of her Pratt instructors. Career Room Decoration in Purple and Gray, 1917 Her work was exhibited in Ogunquit, Maine at Field's studio in 1912. Based upon her work at that show, Walt Kuhn invited her to participate in the 1913 Armory Show, where two of her paintings, Stone Age and Vine Wood were exhibited. What Pelton called \\"Imaginative Paintings\\" were influenced by the work of Arthur B. Davies and depicted the effect of natural light. She made these paintings from 1911 to 1917. Candido, Taos, 1919 Pelton's work changed significantly following a visit to Mabel Dodge Luhan in Taos, New Mexico in 1919. She painted in oil and used pastels to create realistic portraits and desert landscapes and her works were exhibited in Santa Fe at the School of American Research. Pelton visited Pueblo Native Americans in the American southwest. Pelton had her studios in Greenwich Village in New York City until 1921 when her mother died. She moved to Long Island and lived in a Hayground windmill that had been converted to a house. She also traveled to Hawaii, Beirut, Syria, Georgia and California. She painted portraits and still lifes in Hawaii in 1923 and 1924. She created abstract works of art beginning 1926, which were exhibited in New York at the Argent Galleries and the Museum of New Mexico. By 1926, she had exhibited in 20 group exhibitions and 14 solo exhibitions. She settled in Cathedral City, California in 1932. Pelton originally intended to just visit the area, but lived there for nearly 30 years. She wrote: Pelton recorded her spiritual and philosophical thoughts, had an \\"intense interest\\" in Agni Yoga, which influenced her work. Seven of her paintings, like Fires of Spring and White Fire, represented the fire symbol of Agni Yoga. She had a close friendship with modern transpersonal astrology pioneer Dane Rudhyar and Modernist Southwest painter Raymond Jonson. In 1938, she was a co-founder, first president, and the oldest member of the Transcendental Painting Group. Pelton died in Cathedral City in 1961 and was cremated. Her ashes were buried in the San Jacinto Mountains. Posthumous exhibitions and legacy \\"Agnes Pelton, Poet of Nature\\", a 1995-1996 retrospective exhibition of her work, brought national attention to her work. Curator Michael Zakian wrote: In 2009, her work was exhibited with three other Modernist artists: Georgia O'Keeffe, Florence Miller Pierce, and Agnes Martin. A 192-page catalog accompanied the exhibition. From March to September 2019, the Phoenix Art Museum held an exhibition featuring over 40 of Pelton's works. From March 13 to June 28 2020, Whitney Museum of American Art held an exhibit organized by the Phoenix Art Museum, \\"Agnes Pelton: The Desert Transcendentalist\\". The Agnes Pelton Society was founded in 2013 to promote Pelton's life and legacy.

This kind of a tool provides a complementary service for any Embedded Linux driven product and is specialized for the needs of embedded products. However, Embedded Linux distributions do not provide such a tool. Other similar tools which are available are not suited for embedded products in terms of compatibility, performance and limited hardware resources. The PCD is a proven solution that already drives millions of devices in the world. Background The PCD project was designed and implemented by Hai Shalom, senior software engineer at Texas Instruments Israel at the time, as part of his M.Sc. degree in Computer Science. The project was initiated due to a true need in one of Texas Instruments‚Äô broadband solutions (ARM1176 Running MV-Linux Pro-5.00). The system was originally started with shell scripts, where the init process started the rcS script, and it started some other scripts. Due to the rapid development process of the system's software, more processes and tasks were added, and the scripts became too long, unreadable and hard to maintain. There was no efficient way to control the startup process of the system. Synchronizing inter-process dependency was difficult and determining the order of initialization required a lot of effort. For example, a daemon which listens on a socket must precede any clients that send data on this socket. With shell scripts, there is no efficient way to verify this condition. A service with a complex state machine that needs to be in a specific state before it is ready has no standard means to synchronize with its clients. Monitoring the system's health was another issue. There was no entity that monitored and controlled the processes in the system. Therefore, in case of a crash, the system became unstable or unusable until the crashed process was manually detected. At that time, the runtime debugging capabilities were very limited. In case of a process crash, there was no debug information available, unless compiling a special version that supports low optimizations, debug symbols and a GDB server. Once PCD was integrated into the product, the final results showed reduced startup time and great improvements in the system's robustness, reliability and availability. The Debugging and remote debugging capabilities were also improved due to the extended debug information which was available in case of a crash (Segmentation fault, bus error, or similar). The project is no longer active but has been extended to support more embedded architectures and new features. Features in high-level * Start up the system in a synchronized and deterministic manner, according to a textual configuration file. * Control and monitor all the processes and services in the system. * Recover the system in case of errors or crashes, make it more reliable. * Provide useful and detailed debug information in case of a crash: Process details, registers dump and memory map. * Create a graphical representation of the system's processes. =Configuration= The PCD needs to be configured with all the processes, daemons and tasks it controls. The configuration is done in runtime, using a simple, human readable configuration file (AKA PCD Script). Each process has its own rule block which describes it, defines its dependency in other rules, defines its details and what action to perform in case it fails. The rule blocks define the inter-process dependencies in the most deterministic manner, and as a result, the PCD builds a dependency tree out of this information. Once all rules are written, and a dependency tree is established, the PCD can startup the system in the most reliable way, and the boot time will be faster, comparing to script startup. The PCD scripts can also be used in the host machine to generate a graphical representation of the system startup dependencies for better understanding it, and for documentation purposes, as can be seen in the following example: File:PCD-System-Graph.png =Crash recovery= One of the big advantages of the PCD, is its debug capabilities and crash recovery abilities. The PCD also implements a crash daemon that constantly monitors the system health, and performs a recovery action in case of a crash. This feature enhances the system's stability, robustness and availability. File:PCD-Crash-Daemon.png The PCD also provides a lot of useful debug information that can help the developers and the test engineers to understand what happened. The debug information is displayed on the system's console, and can be stored in a non-volatile storage for later analysis. The detailed debug information includes all the process details, all signal details, a complete register dump (on supported architectures) and the process's address map. File:PCD-Crash-Report.png This debug information is available anytime and everywhere (even in the field) and it does not require a special debug build.

Reviews The PCD Project received good reviews from software engineers and project managers who used it in their project; \\"PCD is a huge success in a project I am responsible for. It provides 4 major advantages: It simplifies the initialization code, it improves boot time, it reduces debugging effort (providing great crash logs), and improves the traditional WD implementation (monitoring all processes and act accordingly). All this translate to a better product and efficient development flow\\".Project manager, Texas Instruments The PCD Project was presented in the ARM Technology Conference 2010, and received good feedback. \\"Things are getting a lot easier for software developers who want to use open source Linux in their real time embedded designs, particularly on the ARM architecture\\".Bernard Cole - Embedded Linux development gets easier at Arm TechCon References External links * PCD Project page at SourceForge.net - Download latest version, browse the code, join the community or get help and support. * PCD support forum * PCD Presentation at the ARM Technology Conference 2010 * GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 Category:Linux software Category:Embedded Linux Category:Free software distributions ","title":"Process control daemon"},{"id":"30645611","text":"Feminist Economics is a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Routledge and the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) in the field of feminist economics.

With their victory, the Associated Press awarded the Irish the national championship in ranking them first in their final poll. =Scoring summary= References Category:1973‚Äì74 NCAA football bowl games 1973 1973 1973 Sugar Bowl Category:December 1973 sports events in the United States ","title":"1973 Sugar Bowl"},{"id":"30645882","text":"HitFix, or HitFix.com, is an entertainment news website that launched in December 2008 specializing in breaking entertainment news, insider information, and reviews and critiques of film, music, and television.

It was released March 22, 2011 for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and March 23, 2011 for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. The setting revolves around a flock of 50 blue bipedal creatures, dubbed swarmites, and their quest to collect DNA in order to save their race. The player controls the swarmites as a collective, but each swarmite has individual intelligence meaning interaction between the player and the swarm is always dynamic. The game was received moderately well by critics with aggregate scores in the 70% range for both platforms at GameRankings, a video game aggregate website. Critics generally felt the game was unique and that it featured impressive artificial intelligence. They also praised the game's dark humor, most notably for the different ways the swarmites can die. Some critics expressed frustration at the game's difficulty level. As of June 2011 the Xbox 360 version had reached 13,000 in sales, while the PlayStation 3 version showed numbers nearing 2,000 during the game's first month. Synopsis The game begins by showing a pulsing blue blob arriving on a mysteriously war-torn and devastated planet. It plants itself into the ground and extends a wriggling tentacle. Out of the tentacle emerge 50 swarmites ‚Äî small, blue, bipedal creatures who always move together in a pack, or swarm. The swarmites go in search of DNA, which the swarmites feed back into the blob to help it grow. The blob eventually transforms into a humongous swarmite referred to by the other swarmites as \\"momma\\". Gameplay In Swarm the player controls a group of swarmites which work as a collective to achieve goals. Swarm is an action-platform game in which the player controls up to 50 characters known as swarmites who operate as a collective to achieve their goals. The objective is to reach the end of the level with at least one swarmite remaining. Throughout the levels are health packs which will restore the swarmites' numbers to 50. The levels also contain checkpoints which serve as the point where players will resume play if they lose all 50 swarmites. Points are earned by collecting strands of DNA found throughout the level. Some strands can only be collected by having several swarmites and using them collectively to retrieve the strand. The swarmites can huddle together for strength and speed boosts, stack on top of one another to reach high obstacles, and jump as a group to reach certain areas. All of the swarmites are controlled both individually as well as in a collective; each swarmite has their own unique AI that interacts with other swarmites and the commands given by the player. Swarmites will dynamically walk around objects and obstacles, each choosing their own path based on player commands. Development and marketing Swarm began life as a submission to the Great Canadian Video Game Competition held by Telefilm Canada. The game was chosen as one of four finalists, and Hothead Games received $300,000 in order to fund further production on the game. It sprang from AI research by Dr. Mike Hayward, who was doing PhD research on how artificial life would interact one with another when given a task. \\"We were trying to enter an indie developer contest back in 2006, and Mike pitched this idea forward\\" stated producer Joel DeYoung. Lead Designer Pete Low stated that one of the biggest challenges was designing the camera controls to be able to accommodate all 50 swarmites. Each swarmite in the swarm is controlled by individual AI. The group does not have a leader, but instead interact with each other dynamically. \\"The idea is it's supposed to feel like controlling a flock of fish\\" stated Dr. Mike Hayward, who designed the AI. The game features leaderboards and in addition the PlayStation 3 version includes a live tally of the sum of all swarmites killed by players. On June 17, 2010 Ignition Entertainment announced they would publish the title. The platforms for the game were announced November 18, 2010; the game would come to the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and to the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. The game was completed in January 2011 and entered the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network submission process. It was later announced the developers were looking for a March 2011 release date. Swarm was released March 22, 2011 on the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network and March 23, 2011 for the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade. To promote the game developer Hothead Games released several YouTube videos which discussed the gameplay and advertised the game. Four videos belong to a series entitled Ask Dr. Mike, in which Dr. Mike Hayward, designer of the AI, explains the dynamics of the game. Hayward and different co-hosts discuss how the swarmites interact with one another and their environment, how players can complete tasks within the game, and how players can reach high scores. Two viral videos were also released. The first was to promote the game's launch in Europe and depicts a young girl coloring pictures of swarmites. The girl soon turns violent on her drawings and the video shifts to show gameplay of the destruction of swarmites. The second depicted a fictional situation regarding workplace diversity and the recent hire of a swarmite. Avatar awards were also announced in March 2011 and consist of a swarmite pet and a swarmite hat for the player's avatar. Reception Upon its release Swarm was received moderately well by critics. The game currently holds a score of 71.6% on the PlayStation 3 and 70.41% for the Xbox 360 at GameRankings. Fellow aggregate website reports similar scores, with both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions holding at 70/100. In its first two weeks the PlayStation Network version of the game sold over 4,200 copies. The Xbox Live Arcade version sold over 7,700 copies in the same time frame. Colin Moriarty of IGN gave Swarm its highest score. He stated \\"the entire package has a slick coat of polish on it.\\" One of the game's lower scores came from Ludwig Kietzmann of Joystiq who felt that the game is \\"a good idea in need of better executions.\\" As a technology demo game won the People's Choice Award at the 2007 Arcadia Festival. As of June 2011 the Xbox 360 version had reached 13,000 in sales, while the PlayStation 3 version showed numbers nearing 2,000 during the game's first month. Year-end 2011 sales for Xbox Live Arcade exceeded 20,000 units. Multiple critics praised the game's dark humor. David Sanchez, reviewer for GameZone, stated \\"the little blue Swarmites are completely stupid, and they have a ridiculous charm to them that makes you want to see them meet their demise.\\" Sanchez further noted that seeing the swarmites die was \\"strangely satisfying and totally hilarious.\\" IGN's Colin Moriarty called the swarmite deaths \\"saddening and necessary,\\" but added that players will \\"never grow tired of seeing it happen.\\" Ben Reeves of Game Informer also enjoyed the game's humor, but felt that there was not enough variety to keep a player's interest. \\"It may be fun to watch these little guys die, but there were too many moments where I wanted to kill the power to my console.\\" GameSpot's Nathan Meunier felt that it had an excellent scoring mechanic and that the rewards for killing swarmites were clever. He did not, however that the game had an \\"occasionally brutal\\" difficulty level and that it was too short. Ben Reeves of Game Informer also agreed that the game had a high difficulty curve. He stated that \\"it can feel like a chore to master some of the later levels\\". The reviewer from Edge magazine echoed other critics' comments in regard to difficulty, \\"Swarm will provide a stern test of both skill and patience.\\" The reviewer for Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine felt that a stronger focus on simply clearing the levels could have been utilized, but noted that it was still a \\"surprisingly challenging--and splattering--good time.\\"PlayStation: The Official Magazine (US) (April 2011) Official Xbox Magazines Cameron Lewis praised the games light-hearted attitude, sharp graphics and control scheme. He further noted that an \\"emphasis on constant scoring keeps the action trucking at a steady clip.\\"Official Xbox Magazine (April 2011) References Category:2011 video games Category:Action video games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games ","title":"Swarm (2011 video game)"},{"id":"30646132","text":"James Paul Oetken ( ; born October 1, 1965), known professionally as J.

Early life and education  Oetken was born on October 1, 1965 in Louisville, Kentucky. He was valedictorian and class president at Regis High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1988 from the University of Iowa and a Juris Doctor in 1991 from Yale Law School. From 1991 until 1992, Oetken served as a law clerk for Judge Richard Cudahy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and from 1992 until 1993, he served as a law clerk to Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer on the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. From 1993 until 1994, Oetken served as a law clerk to Associate Justice Harry Blackmun on the United States Supreme Court.  Professional career  During the mid-1990s, Oetken worked as an associate with the law firm of Jenner & Block. In 1997, he joined the Office of Legal Counsel in the United States Department of Justice as an attorney-advisor, where he worked until becoming an Associate Counsel to the President of the United States in the office of the White House Counsel in 1999. He held that job until President Bill Clinton left office in 2001.

New York Senator Charles Schumer recommended Oetken to the post. Schumer recommended Oetken a year after he recommended former Assistant United States Attorney Daniel S. Alter, also openly gay, whom the White House declined to nominate after concluding, because of statements that had been attributed to Alter, that his nomination was unlikely to survive the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. Schumer stated that diversity was a consideration in his recommendations for federal judgeships, and that he was \\"shocked to learn\\" that no openly gay men had served on the federal bench. The full United States Senate confirmed Oetken on July 18, 2011 in an 80‚Äì13 vote. He received his commission on July 20, 2011. Oetken is the second openly gay Article III judge in the country, after Deborah Batts.  Personal life  Oetken lives with his husband Makky Pratayot in Manhattan. They were married on September 6, 2014 at Jane Hotel in Manhattan by Judge Alison J. Nathan.

Columbus Sims. After marching to Fort Ruby, in Nevada Territory, Sims was relieved of his command by the Department of the Pacific on August 19, 1862. He was replaced in command of the 2nd California Cavalry detachment by McGarry by Col. Patrick Edward Connor. Under Connor's command the 2nd Cavalry served in Nevada and Utah during the rest of the Civil War, fighting various native tribes. In the early 1860s, the Bannock and Shoshone Indians in southern Idaho were becoming increasingly aggressive toward passing wagon trains. Travelers reported instances of thievery and attacks. McGarry was sent to investigate, and reportedly executed some Shoshone for their actions. McGarry's executions angered the Shoshone even more, prompting them to threaten to kill any white person they found above the Bear River. American forces, led by Colonel Patrick Edward Connor, were sent to confront the Shoshone, but the Battle of Bear River turned into a massacre that left 250 Shoshone dead.Frances H.

After one year playing for the FC's youth academy, he was called up to the reserve team in 2005. In 2006, Wunderlich made his senior debut in Regionalliga match against VfB L√ºbeck. He would go on to play fifteen more matches that season. After playing all but two of 1. FC K√∂ln's Regionalliga matches in the first half of the 2008‚Äì09 season, he transferred to Rot-Weiss Essen, another Regionalliga team. =Rot- Weiss Essen and FSV Frankfurt= Wunderlich would play one and a half season for Essen, before joining second division club FSV Frankfurt over the summer break in 2010. He seemed to have found his footing in Frankfurt, playing very well in the 2010‚Äì11 season. However, after the season, he requested to be sent back (on loan) to the fifth league team of Viktoria K√∂ln to help him recover from burn out. = Viktoria K√∂ln = In early 2012 he stated that he was not up to handling the pressures of professional football, and asked to remain with Viktoria K√∂ln. His outstanding performance helped Viktoria K√∂ln to be promoted to the newly formed Regionalliga (fourth league) at the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, and get off to a very good start to the 2012‚Äì13 season. Wunderlich was the top scorer of the 2016‚Äì17 Regionalliga West season with 29 goals as Viktoria finished as champions, thus qualifying for the promotion play-offs. He scored from the penalty-spot in the first leg of the club play- off tie against FC Carl Zeiss Jena but it was not enough as they lost on away goals after a 3‚Äì3 aggregate result. Wunderlich was restricted to just 16 matches during the 2018‚Äì19 Regionalliga season but contributed 10 goals as Viktoria again secured the Regionalliga West championship and this time won promotion to the 3.

It originally aired February 9, 2011 on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). The episode was written by Danny Zuker, and directed by Chris Koch. In the episode, Claire and Phil decide to reprise their role-playing adventure from the previous Valentine's Day episode, \\"My Funky Valentine\\". Jay's elaborate Valentine's surprise for Gloria keeps getting held up. An admirer comes between Cameron and Mitchell. \\"Bixby's Back\\" received generally mixed reviews from critics with many saying it was an inadequate sequel to \\"My Funky Valentine\\". Despite the mixed reviews, the episode was viewed by 13.16 million households, according to the Nielsen Media Research, and received a 5.1 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, tying the spot for highest-rated episode of the series at that time with \\"The Old Wagon\\" and \\"Halloween\\". It later became the most viewed scripted program of the week among 18- to 49-year-old adults. Plot At the Dunphy house, Phil (Ty Burrell) and Claire (Julie Bowen) decide to have a small dinner for Valentine's Day in order to avoid the disastrous results of the events of last year. Since they only could get a very early dinner reservation, Claire realizes that all the couples are elderly so she decides to bring back their characters from last year, Clive Bixby and Julianna. Julianna has Clive ditch his wife and meet her at their hotel. At the bar, Claire gives Phil the key to her room. While watching Claire walk way, Phil takes the wrong room key belonging to an older woman who was arranging her purse. He enters the wrong room, sprinkles rose petals on the bed, undresses, and waits on the bed with a bottle of champagne. The older woman then walks in after coming back from the bar. Back at the house, Phil and Claire decide to just act like themselves. Haley's (Sarah Hyland) boyfriend David blows her off to study for a big exam. Manny (Rico Rodriguez) expects to profit from Haley being free from both David and Dylan (Reid Ewing) and manages to convince Haley to send David a break-up email. She feels liberated for a brief moment but then her ex-boyfriend Dylan shows up with his band on a flatbed of a truck and he sings a love song to her. Haley rushes into Dylan's arms and thus Manny's hopes of wooing Haley are dashed. Meanwhile, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) suspects Mitchell's new assistant, Broderick (Jeremy Rowley), has a crush on Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), which he denies but secretly affirms. His suspicion is soon proven wrong when Broderick hugs Cameron in an elevator revealing that he is the real object of his desire. While eating dinner together, Cameron reveals this to Mitchell, who still believes Broderick has a crush on him. To see which one is right, the two go to Broderick's house, but after getting a text from Broderick which says he is quitting, the two decide it would be best if they never knew which one of them Broderick liked. Jay (Ed O'Neill) plans out a perfect Valentine's surprise for Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara). He hires a chef to prepare her a luxurious meal at their house, but must keep Gloria away while the chef is setting up. Jay takes Gloria to a great restaurant that she loves, with the intent to leave after pretending to find that his secretary had forgotten to make a reservation. Unfortunately his plan goes awry; at the restaurant there really is a reservation for two under the name Pritchett, so they have to stay much to Gloria's delight and Jay's flabbergasted anguish. Later, the reservation turns out to have been for Cameron and Mitchell, so that relieved and elated Jay and furious Gloria have to leave again. Back at their house, the two have a fight and Gloria refuses to go inside. She is so angry she wants to get in her car and take a drive to cool down. Jay has no choice but to carry the screaming Gloria into the house for her surprise dinner. When the two finally go into the house, however, Jay is stunned to find the house empty. Gloria goes to the garage to take her car out for her drive with Jay following. As the garage door opens we see the romantic surprise dinner is, for some reason, taking place in the garage. Gloria reveals that she had figured out Jay's secret plan, moved it to the garage, and bought him a new motorcycle which sits beside the dinner table. Production \\"Bixby's Back\\" was written by Danny Zuker, his sixth writing credit for the series. The episode was directed by Chris Koch, his third credit for the series. The episode is considered a sequel to the first season episode, \\"My Funky Valentine\\". Many plots of the episode were revealed before the episode's airdate by TV Guide writers Adam Bryant and Natalie Abrams. It originally aired on February 9, 2011 on the American Broadcasting Company. \\"Bixby's Back\\" was filmed between January 5, and January 17, 2011. The episode also featured the return of Reid Ewing's character, Dylan, after he broke up with Haley. Julie Bowen said in an interview with TV Guide at the 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards that, \\"This year's Valentine's Day episode is pretty insane, It's different than last year's. Clive and Julianna are back, but Clive is in the more compromising position this time instead of Julianna.\\" Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Bixby's Back\\" was viewed by an estimated 13.16 million viewers according to the Nielsen Media Research, and received a 5.1 rating/13% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49.

The A.V. Club writer John Teti gave the episode a mixed review calling it \\"fine\\". Teti wrote that he felt like the producers \\"was doing Valentine‚Äôs Day [episode] out of obligation\\" and that the writers did not have a \\"great idea\\" for this episode like \\"My Funky Valentine\\". He ultimately gave the episode a B-. Entertainment Weekly writer Lesley Savage gave the episode a more positive review saying the cast \\"proved why they truly deserved the award in tonight's Valentine's Day themed episode.\\" Rachael Maddux of New York magazine said the episode was a great sequel to \\"My Funky Valentine\\" calling it \\"a solid episode, start to finish\\". Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times said the episode was below the show's usual quality writing that \\"it didn't quite have the usual zing\\". CNN writer Henry Hanks gave the episode a more positive review and praised Ty Burrell's performance calling him the \\"MVP of the week\\". He later went on to criticize Mitchell and Cameron's sub-plot calling it \\"another sub-par storyline\\". Despite the mixed reviews, many praised Ty Burrell's performance. Teti praised both the writing and the acting in the bar scene writing that \\"There is a fantastic run of writing during Clive and Juliana‚Äôs rendezvous at the bar, as every smooth Clive Bixby utterance stumbles out of Phil‚Äôs mouth with just the right amount of awkwardness\\". Maddux called his performance \\"comedic mastery\\".

The women worked for WWE and were featured primarily on the SmackDown brand but appeared on the Raw brand on some occasions, while they were champions and were also part of the second season of NXT, mentoring the male wrestler Kaval, who won the competition. They first began teaming together in June 2009 but did not become a proper team until the end of the year. The two were portrayed as narcissistic and vain bullies, constantly espousing their own perfection while ganging up on others and attacking their looks. They were a successful team, having won both women's titles available in WWE, the WWE Women's Championship, which they retired when they unified it with the WWE Divas Championship; both titles they claimed to hold as a tag team though this is not officially recognized. The group did court some controversy, however, receiving criticism from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter for what it considered the most disgusting promotional tactic regarding a storyline in which they bullied Mickie James for her supposed weight issues. In May 2011, after nearly two years together, the team disbanded following several disagreements, at which point Layla defeated McCool in a Loser Leaves WWE match. History = Formation and feud with Mickie James (2009‚Äì2010) = Though Layla and McCool had been tagging together over the summer of 2009 (due to partly because of a feud between McCool and Melina over the Women's Championship until she was traded back to Raw), they did not become a unit and display signs of a similar character and gimmick until the end of the year when Mickie James moved to SmackDown. James defeated Layla in her first match back on the show on October 23, while reigning Women's Champion McCool snubbed Mickie James when picking Divas to represent SmackDown against Raw in a Bragging Rights interbrand tag team match, when her team won. Layla and McCool appeared in a backstage segment on the November 6 episode of SmackDown threatening to make life difficult for James unless she left the brand. They began doing so the following week, by bringing James' clothes to the ringside and cutting them, distracting her enough to lose the match she was in. With James refusing to leave the brand, the situation escalated the following week as McCool began mocking James' weight and agricultural background. After James won a match against Layla, McCool appeared in a cartoon video that depicted James as a pig, renaming her \\"Piggie James\\" as both LayCool would continue to do, while singing a parody of \\"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\\" and a parody of the Porky Pig bass drum outro with the catchphrase \\"Th-Th-Th-Th-That's All Folks\\", portraying James as Porky. This particular segment garnered criticism from journalists, describing it as disgusting and despicable. Subsequently at the following pay-per-view, Survivor Series, McCool led a team of five Divas, including Layla, against James' team, James' team won with two surviving members: James and Raw's Divas Champion Melina. James was granted a match for the Women's Championship at TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs, after winning a triple threat match on the December 4 episode of SmackDown, with James defiantly refusing to leave the SmackDown brand despite continued harassment from LayCool. At Tables, Ladders & Chairs, Layla interfered in the match to help McCool retain the championship. Despite the win, LayCool continued to torment James as they tried to make her leave, buying her a Jenny Craig gift certificate for the Christmas Day episode of SmackDown, but gained some revenge by pinning Layla in a tag team match in the same episode. Going into the new year, the rivalry widened on the January 1 episode of SmackDown. LayCool interfered in a match between James and Beth Phoenix and attacked James after; Phoenix responded by chasing away LayCool but giving the Glam Slam to James as well. The following week, Phoenix defeated Layla, but afterwards LayCool assaulted her together until James saved Phoenix. On January 22's SmackDown, in an unusually long segment for the Divas, LayCool held a leaving party for James complete with a pig-shaped cake. Originally Maria came out to defend champion James, but James also appeared to answer LayCool. After a brawl broke out, Phoenix arrived on the scene appearing to come to their aid only to assist LayCool in attacking James and Maria. McCool hit James with the cake and poured punch over her. LayCool continued to deride James, with Layla dressing up in a fatsuit with a pig mask and losing to McCool in a faux match for the Women's Championship as Piggie James. LayCool's boasting would be their downfall at the Royal Rumble, however, when Layla came out in the Piggie James outfit. James used this to her advantage, when she attacked Layla which distracted McCool allowing her to be pinned in under a minute, losing the Women's Championship. On the February 12 episode of SmackDown, LayCool defeated James in a non-title handicap match made by SmackDown Consultant Vickie Guerrero, who had been accidentally humiliated by James backstage. = Acquisition of Vickie Guerrero and co-champions (2010‚Äì2011) = With a common enemy, Guerrero began accompanying LayCool, interfering in their matches and favoring them in scripted booking decisions such as making herself the referee in McCool's Women's Championship rematch with James where she brought the title back to McCool on the February 26 episode of SmackDown. With James out of the picture, their lingering rivalry with Phoenix flared up when Phoenix saved Tiffany from a LayCool beatdown on March 12. The following week, Tiffany and Phoenix defeated LayCool in a standard tag team match. This led to a 10-Diva tag team match at WrestleMania XXVI which LayCool helped win after Guerrero pinned Kelly Kelly with a frog splash. Phoenix gained revenge by defeating them again alongside Tiffany. On WWE Superstars, LayCool and Guerrero cut a promo in which they mocked Phoenix for not fitting their image of what a Diva should be, and Guerrero placed Phoenix in an 'intergender' match against Layla, which Phoenix won, despite heavy interfering from McCool and Guerrero. LayCool later gained a measure of revenge by defeating Phoenix and a briefly-returning James, after which they taunted Phoenix's perceived bad looks by smothering her in make-up. At the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, McCool defended her Women's Championship against Phoenix in an Extreme Makeover match, where cosmetics products were legal as weapons. Phoenix won the title from McCool, despite support from Layla and Guerrero. On the May 14 episode of SmackDown, Guerrero announced McCool was using her rematch against Phoenix, but the match was made a handicap match with both of LayCool against Phoenix. Layla pinned Phoenix to win the Women's Championship for the first time, becoming the first British woman and Diva Search winner to hold the championship. LayCool's beating of Phoenix was given as the reason Phoenix had to take time off for an injury she was suffering from. Owing to LayCool beating Phoenix together for the title, they began referring to themselves as co-champions, even appearing with two physical title belts. During the 2010 WWE Draft, they defeated Raw Divas (Eve & Maryse) to receive one Diva draft pick, and it was later revealed that Kelly Kelly was drafted to SmackDown and started a feud with her and her partner Tiffany. Around this time, Rosa Mendes asked to join the ranks of LayCool, but LayCool mocked and insulted her instead. LayCool continued to best Kelly and Tiffany in tag team action, but Kelly Kelly gained singles non-title victories over both Layla and McCool, earning her a Women's Championship match against Layla at Money in the Bank, which Layla won to retain the title. Layla was then informed that she would defend the Women's Championship against Tiffany on the July 30 episode of SmackDown, but Vickie Guerrero claimed that LayCool were co-women's champions, and had McCool fight in Layla's place, in which McCool was victorious. Following the match, SmackDown's General Manager, Theodore Long, informed LayCool that there was only one Women's Championship and they had to decide between them and relinquish one belt. The following week, LayCool gave one belt back and played a tug-of-war with the one belt, only for it to break in the middle and the two began to carry half of the belt each, circumventing Long's orders. Also during this time, LayCool began mentoring Kaval during the second season of NXT. They were the first females and tag team to mentor a wrestler on the show. Kaval would go on to win the season. LayCool continued to pick up victories against Kelly and Tiffany. In September, LayCool appeared on Raw and challenged WWE Divas Champion Melina to a championship unification match at Night of Champions. Despite Layla being the official champion, McCool participated in the match and won with Layla's help to unify both championships. Once again, they reigned unofficially as co- champions, wearing two belts and declaring themselves the WWE Unified Divas Champions while the Women's Championship was retired. The night after Night of Champions on Raw, Layla defended the Unified Divas Championship against Melina, cementing their status as co-champions. After both members of Lay-Cool had successfully defended the championship against Natalya, they faced her in a two-on-one handicap match at Survivor Series, which Natalya won to become the new Divas Champion. Following Survivor Series, Beth Phoenix returned and formed an alliance with Natalya. This culminated in the first Diva Tables match at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per view where Natalya splashed both of LayCool through a table to win. LayCool got a rematch for the Divas Championship at the Royal Rumble against Natalya, but the match was changed by the anonymous Raw general manager to a fatal-four way match including Eve Torres, and was unsuccessful when Eve pinned Layla, despite McCool having simultaneously rolled Natalya up. Tension arose when McCool blamed Layla for the loss, but LayCool smoothed things out. In the coming weeks, Layla continued to lose, despite McCool's help, causing further friction. McCool attacked Rosa Mendes during her match with Layla and caused Layla to lose by disqualification, claiming that Layla was unable to win by herself, and Layla was furious at McCool for having no faith in her. At Elimination Chamber, LayCool attacked Kelly Kelly, who was embroiled in a rivalry with Vickie Guerrero. After saving Guerrero, a returning Trish Stratus came to help Kelly. This would lead to a match at WrestleMania XXVII, where LayCool teamed with Guerrero's on-screen boyfriend Dolph Ziggler to face Trish Stratus, Nicole \\"Snooki\\" Polizzi and John Morrison. At WrestleMania, LayCool and Ziggler lost, and tension arose again between McCool and Layla. = Implosion and break-up (2011) = On the April 8 episode of SmackDown, tension between the team rose when McCool refused to tag Layla into a match against Kelly and Phoenix. Layla continued trying to fix their relationship, but McCool was resistant. Tension was further highlighted in a SmackDown scene where the two were seen undergoing couples therapy. When Layla lost a singles match against Kelly despite McCool's attempts to help her, McCool told Layla she was sick of doing all her work for her, and shoved her over. Finally, on the April 22 episode of SmackDown, McCool turned on Layla by attacking her after the therapy session, thereby disbanding LayCool. During the 2011 WWE Draft, McCool cost Layla a match against Eve Torres. After the match, McCool tried to taunt and bully Layla again, however Layla snapped after all of her efforts at trying to keep LayCool together, and viciously attacked McCool, saying she was sick of her, before throwing her at the announce table, thus turning face in the process. On the April 29 episode of SmackDown, Layla and McCool fought to a no contest. After the match, Layla challenged McCool to a no countout, no disqualification match at Extreme Rules. McCool accepted on the condition that the loser leave WWE. At Extreme Rules, Layla defeated McCool, which meant she had to leave WWE. After the match, a debuting Kharma came out and attacked McCool with the Implant Buster. Layla retired from wrestling on July 29, 2015.

It is situated in Kanke, Ranchi in Jharkhand state of India. CIP, Ranchi History The institute dates back to the days of the British Raj in India. The British established this hospital on 17 May 1918 with the name of 'Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum'. It had then a capacity of 174 patients (92 males and 82 females). It catered to the needs of the European mental patients only and it was under the direct control and management of Government of Bihar (then, Jharkhand was a part of Bihar). In 1922, it was put under the control of a Board of Trustees with various participating state governments represented in the Board and in the very same year its name was changed to 'European Mental Hospital'. The year 1922 is also notable for the fact that the Institute was affiliated to the University of London for the Diploma in Psychological Medicine examination. It was a unique phenomenon since the postgraduate training in Psychiatry was nonexistent in India in those days. Timeline * The first Occupational Therapy Department in 1922 * ECT in 1943 * Psychosurgery and Neurosurgery in 1947 * Clinical psychology and Electroencephalography (EEG) departments in 1948 * a full- fledged neuropathology section in 1952 * the first use of Lithium in 1952 and chlorpromazine in 1953 * A very modern radiology department with facility for sophisticated cerebral angiography, pneumoencephalography, air ventriculography, myelography etc. was established in 1954 * Child guidance clinic in 1950 * Rural mental health clinic at Mander in 1967 * rehabilitation centre and sheltered workshop in 1967, and * industrial psychiatry unit at HEC, Ranchi in 1973. Indian Psychiatric Society The Indian Psychiatric Society was established in 1948 because of the efforts of this Institute and it is registered in Patna. The first draft of the Bill that subsequently became the Mental Health Act of India (1987) was written at C.I.P, Ranchi in 1949 by Dr. R.B. Davis, the then Medical Superintendent, Dr. S.A. Hasib, from Indian Mental Hospital, Ranchi and Dr. J. Roy, from Mental Hospital, Gwalior. The latter two too had worked at C.I.P., Ranchi at one time or other. Hospital The hospital is spread over 210 acres of lush green campus. There are 16 wards ‚Äì nine for male patients, six for female patients and a Family Unit. CIP ranchi is the largest psychiatric hospital in whole Asia. They have a total bed capacity of 643. Each ward is of pavilion type and has well laid out roads and lawns around it. The wards were built during the British Raj, and are named after eminent European psychiatrists and physicians. The wards are at some distance from each other, and the male and female sections are separated by a high wall. Unlike other mental hospitals, CIP, Ranchi has never been a custodial care facility. It has always been an open hospital and the patients are never confined to rooms. They are free to roam within the boundary wall of the hospital. Every year, about 3000 patients are admitted and discharged after treatment. Individualized patient care is a regular practice in the hospital. Besides pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, psychotherapies and family interventions are routinely employed. A milieu therapy approach exists where patients participate in running the ward and help in looking after other patients. Regular physical exercise, outdoor and indoor games and Yoga are on hand for the patients. A very well stacked library having books in English, Hindi, Urdu and Bengali as well as a number of newspapers and magazines is freely accessible to the patients. Medical Training Central Institute of Psychiatry is one of the premier training centers in India for mental health professionals. The erstwhile Hospital for Mental Diseases was recognized for D.P.M. of England in as far back as 1923, when postgraduate courses in Psychiatry were unheard of in India. In 1962, a postgraduate training centre was added to the institute, with D.P.M. and D.M. & S.P. courses. Other courses were added in due course of time, and currently the following postgraduate course in psychiatry and behavioral sciences are conducted at the Institute: * M.D. (Psychiatry) * Diploma in Psychological Medicine * Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology * M.Phil in Medical & Social Psychology/M.Phil Clinical Psychology (2012 onward) * M.Phil in Psychiatric Social Work * Diploma in Psychiatric Nursing The Institute is affiliated to Ranchi University. Admission to the various courses is through open advertisement in all the leading newspapers. The candidates are selected for admission by a Selection Committee constituted by the Director General of health Services, New Delhi. Special clinics Special clinics are held on particular days of the week. * Mondays - Neurology Clinic * Tuesdays - Sleep Clinic * Wednesdays - Chronic Schizophrenia clinic, Skin clinic & Sex clinic, Movement disorder clinic * Thursdays - Epilepsy Clinic * Fridays - Memory Clinic * Saturdays - Headache Clinic, De-addiction clinic * All weekdays - Child Guidance Clinic & Mood Clinic Controversy and criticisms =2013 student strike= MPhil and PhD students of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP) went on an indefinite dharna demanding immediate recognition of the courses by Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI). RCI had de-recognised the programmes in 2009 for not having adequate number of Professors.Other courses also lacked qualified staff, which raised serious concerns about the quality of Mental Health Professional Training. The pioneer institute in mental health has not had a qualified permanent professor in Department of Clinical Psychology and Department of social work since last 20 years. The other factors which bought about the strike were discrimination, harassment and exploitation of the students. CIP neglected the Ranchi High Court Verdict-2008 to appoint professors in various departments. =Mass breakout of patients= In September, 1984, the Press Trust of India reported that 460 patients out of over a thousand patients in CIP had escaped from the premises. They were able to do so because all the staff had gone on strike, due to low pay. Even after a week had passed, close to 100 patients were still missing and still had to be located. After the incident, The Times of India reported the poor conditions of the hospital. It said that many of the patients were half- starved and in poor health, suffering from skin diseases and diarrhea. It also alleged that the two meals served daily reeked of urine. The Times also stated in a later report that the medical superintendent of the hospital, Durga Bhagal, was charged by the state government of incompetence and mismanagement. Bhagal denied that there was unusually higher mortality rates within the hospital. The absconding patients who poured into the streets chanted \\"Save Us!\\". The deputy hospital superintendent stated that there have been 131 deaths in the hospital in the previous year, on the year of the incident, at least 151 patients died. The deputy superintendent also stated these deaths were caused by the lack of funds for provisioning basic necessities such as food. A member of the West Bengal Psychiatric Association commented that there was a huge shortage of beds in mental health care. This mass break out of patients occurred in RINPAS which is under the state government. CIP never had any such mass escape. Bhagal never worked in CIP as a superintendent. He held that post in RINPAS =Detention of Chinese prisoner of war= In August, 2000, the AFP picked up news by the South China Sunday Morning Post which reported that two chinese military officers from the Sino-Indian War in 1962, were there held since 1965, after they were charged of espionage. The Indian Home Affairs Minister said that he was not aware of the detention. The individuals were Yang Chen, a fighter pilot and Shih Liang, a flight officer. The CIP staff claimed after their recovery from schizophrenia these two individuals remained their because they had nowhere to go. The Daily Telegraph, London then reported that these two individuals would be returned to China after 35 years of negligence from both the Chinese Embassy and the Indian Home Ministry. The two individuals, as per the account of Dr Nizamie were civilians who had crosses over inadvertently as a consequence of their psychosis =Patient suicides= In August, 2005, The Telegraph reported that at least three individuals from the beginning of the year had committed suicide while being admitted. Unnamed sources from CIP told the newspaper that there was a severe manpower shortage within the hospital. It said that the patient-staff ratio in CIP was 40:1 compared to the recommended 5:1. The allegation of understaffing was refuted by the director of CIP, S Haque Nizami. Helpline The CIP also operates a helpline number, which commenced operations from November, 2011.

Relations between both nations have steadily increased between both nations, especially during 2010. Barbados and Brazil are members of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.  Cooperation  Embassy of Brazil (in Bridgetown) In 2010 several agreements for cooperation have been signed between Brazilian officials and their Barbadian counterparts. On 26 April Barbados was one of several CARICOM nations to take part in the \\"Brazil- Caribbean Community Summit\\". During the event several agreements between Barbados and Brazil were signed, including: a Memorandum of Understanding for a Bilateral Technical Cooperation Agreement, a Cultural Cooperation Agreement, an Air Services Agreement, a Complementary Agreement for the implementation of projects in the field of health; and an agreement to expand the provision of Brazilian lecturers at the University of the West Indies campus in Barbados, with a reciprocal plan to expand similar Caribbean studies programmes in Brazilian institutions of higher education. On 7 October Brazil's Ambassador signed a US $562 600 agreement to a fund Disaster Risk Reduction with the Barbados-based Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA). Also in 2010 both nations signed an agreement to cooperate in the sport of football. Today the agreement has allowed a small group of Barbadian youths to play football at Brazilian football clubs in that nation, with the Barbadian government calling on companies to financially support the new initiative. The University of the West Indies in Barbados has begun research on families of Barbadian descent which moved to Brazil in the early 20th century, known there as \\"Barbadianos\\", the migratory link is being explored as some of Barbados' more prominent names have survived in that South American nation while others have been assimilated into Brazilian culture. In 2011, a group of Samba dancers from the group Sociedade Rosas de Ouro met with Barbados' Minister Of Tourism, Richard Sealy, and also took part in Barbados' biggest festival Crop Over. At the group's meeting with the Minister he touched on Barbados' ties with Brazil and urged more Barbadians to choose Brazil as a vacation destination. = GOL Airlines = After holding negotiations over a number of years both countries officially witnessed the inaugural direct-flight on 26 June 2010. Operated by GOL Airlines the inaugural flight arrived in Barbados at 9:45pm. The cost of the initial scheduled airlift for the Barbados Government has been ridiculed by the political opposition in Parliament, but the David Thompson and subsequent Freundel Stuart administrations attribute Brazilian tourists as a large portion of the increased tourists to Barbados during the economic downturn.  Trade  Negotiations are ongoing to spur trade and business via the new airlink between both nations. This has been done in part by trade missions to Brazil. Barbados, as one of three nations that were joint stakeholders of LIAT proposed that LIAT and GOL should team up to promote low-cost airfares between the entire Caribbean and South America, with Barbadian official hoping it could utilise the Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados as a focal point.

He is best known for his excavations at the Viking Age site of Hedeby, and for his instrumental role in the publishing of the second edition of the Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde. Early life and education Herbert Jankuhn was born in Angerburg, East Prussia, Germany on 8 August 1905. His paternal grandfather was Lithuanian, and his mother was a Masur. Spending his youth in Mitau and Tilsit, Jankuhn studied Germanistics, history, philology and physical exercise at the universities of K√∂nigsberg, Jena and Berlin. Having studied under Max Ebert and Carl Schuchhardt, Jankuhn received in PhD in archaeology at the University of Berlin in 1931. Jankuhn was strongly influenced by Wilhelm Unverzagt and Albert Kiekebusch, both of whom where critical of the settlement archaeology theories of Gustaf Kossinna. Early career Jankuhn completed his habilitation at the University of Kiel in 1935. Since 1930, Jankuhn had conducted excavations at the Viking Age settlement of Hedeby. From 1938, with the help of Ahnenerbe, Jankuhn organized the excavations at Hedeby into one of the largest archaeological projects in the world. The results of his excavations at Hedeby were initially published in 1936, and have since been republished in numerous revised editions. Jankuhn's work at Hedeby greatly impressed Heinrich Himmler, leader of the Schutzstaffel, with whom Jankuhn became friendly. Jankuhn eventually joined both the Nazi Party, the Schutzstaffel, and became Head of the Excavation and Archaeology Department Ahnenerbe in 1940. During World War II, Jankuhn travelled across German-occupied Europe, where he reported to the Sicherheitsdienst on the reliability of scholars in occupied countries. Jankuhn was made an associate professor at the University of Kiel in 1940. In the summer of 1942, Jankuhn followed 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking into the Crimea to conduct excavations at Mangup, capital of the Crimean Goths. From 1942 to 1943, Jankuhn was Professor at the University of Rostock. He spent the last years of the war as an intelligence officer in 5th SS Panzer Division Wiking, which surrendered to the United States Army in Bavaria in 1945. Post-war career Jankuhn was imprisoned from 1945 to 1948. After his release from prison, Jankuhn was forbidden from teaching, but nevertheless continued to teach and research privately. He returned to Kiel in 1949 in to work on restoring museums destroyed during World War II. He subsequently served as a guest lecturer at the universities of Hamburg and Kiel. From the 1950s onward, Jankuhn played an instrumental role in reviving the field of settlement archaeology, and advocated an interdisciplinary approach to the study of prehistory. Since 1956, Jankuhn served as associate professor, and from 1959 professor of prehistory and protohistory at the University of G√∂ttingen. During this time, Jankuhn founded and led a number of scholarly organizations, and edited several scholarly publications. From 1968, Jankuhn was instrumental in the publishing of the second edition of the Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde (1969-2008).

They may have served as passenger boats, freighters, mail-boats, log-boom vessels or a combination thereof. The construction of such vessels posed unique problems on water bodies located away from established dry-docks and marine railways, or connecting canals to such facilities. In some countries such as Switzerland, lake steamers may have been preserved in their original configuration. In the United States with its dynamic economy and changing cultural mores, the survival of such boats often depended on reuses and power plant changes. The MS Mount Washington, with four different power- plants and changes from side-wheeler to screw steamer to diesel power, provides a fine example. Few such vessels survive in the US where the first commercial steamers were launched. Smaller steamers Surviving vessels in near original condition: * Louise‚ÄîSteam yacht preserved on Geneva Lake, Wisconsin, available for cruises. Built in 1902 by the Racine Boat Works for Chicago banker John J. Mitchell, it is an elegant vessel now in passenger excursion service. Originally utilizing a coal-fired boiler, it has been extensively upgraded to a more efficient and environment-friendly diesel-fired Scotch marine boiler, powering a two-cylinder double expansion steam engine. This is a steel-hulled vessel, with mahogany trim, and in operation with the Gage Marine Corporation under the auspices of Bill Gage, third-generation owner of the company. * Minnehaha‚Äî1906 \\"Streetcar\\" style commuter steamer raised from the bottom of Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota.

The Bath Iron Works-built ship served as a log drive vessel as well as providing summer excursions. It is owned and operated by the Moosehead Maritime Museum. Its outward appearance adheres closely to its lake steamer roots. Available for cruises. * MV Mohican II‚ÄîThe MV of Lake George in New York is on the National Register of Historic Places. It was launched in 1907, replacing an earlier wood steamer with the same name. Available for cruises. * MS Mount Washington‚ÄîThe of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire replaced an earlier wooden side-wheel steamer that burned in 1939. Parties interested in continuing the tradition of a lake steamer purchased an old sidewheel vessel on Lake Champlain: the Chateaugay, a , iron-hulled sidewheeler that was being used as a clubhouse for the Burlington yacht club. It was cut into sections and transported to Lake Winnipesaukee on rail cars. A new twin-screw vessel was designed for the hull being welded back together at Lakeport, New Hampshire. Powered by two steam engines taken from an ocean-going yacht, the new Mount Washington made her maiden voyage on August 15, 1940. The ship has been renovated multiple times, including several upgrades to the ship power plant, and hull extensions added to lengthen the ship.

It stands at an altitude of , on the south bank of the River Dee, west of Ballater, and about east of the royal residence of Balmoral Castle. Behind it rises Creag nam Ban, a rounded granite hill about high, and across the river to its front is the cairn-crowned Geallaig Hill, rising to . It is protected as a category A listed building. The castle is the home of Baron Abergeldie. History The name derives from the Pictish language, and means the \\"Confluence of Geldie,\\" a reference to its location near the confluence of River Geldie and River Dee. (Note: attempts have been made to derive the name from Scottish Gaelic, such as \\"inbhir-gile\\" [\\"shining {or bright} confluence\\"], but while aber and inbhir both mean \\"confluence\\" the former is derived from Pictish, a P-Celtic [Brythonic] language which once dominated in Britain, while the latter is derived from Gaelic, a Q-Celtic [Goidelic] language, originating in Ireland. Since Abergeldie is in the heartland of the ancient Pictish realm, and is surrounded by other place names incorporating \\"aber\\" [including nearby Aberdeen], it is safe to assume that Pictish is the correct origin of the name.) A late Bronze Age standing stone, about 6.5 feet high, 2.5 feet wide, and 1.25 feet thick on the lawn of the castle is one indicator of the great antiquity of this site, and its long occupation by man. It also has one of the longest unbroken records of ownership, being in the hands of the Gordon family for 600 years. It was most likely built around 1550 by Sir Alexander Gordon of Midmar, son of the first Earl of Huntly, on grounds acquired by the Gordon family in 1482. The interior has been returned to its original state, restored by a descendant of the builder. During the course of the first Jacobite rising in 1689‚Äì90, the castle was besieged by Jacobite forces. However, following the defeat of General Buchan's Jacobite forces by Sir Thomas Livingstone at Cromdale on 1 May 1690, General Hugh Mackay of Scourie marched with some cavalry and 1,400 Williamite Dutch infantry (probably including his own former regiment) to lift the siege. It figured again in the 1715 Jacobite Rising, being garrisoned by government troops (having then only recently been renovated by Rachel Gordon, 10th Heiress, and her husband, Captain Charles Gordon, who had also built nearby Birkhall, later sold to the current royal family), and again in the short 1719 Rising, when it was briefly garrisoned by Spanish troops. In 1848 Prince Albert, Victoria's Consort, purchased the lease of the Abergeldie estate for 40 years, as Abergeldie was relatively close to the new royal Scottish residence of Balmoral. Birkhall, with an estate of 6,500 acres was bought from the Gordons by Albert the Queen's Consort about the same time (though there has long been a local rumour that the Laird lost Birkhall in a card game). Albert gave the property to his son Albert Edward (known by his family and intimates as \\"Bertie\\"), then the Prince of Wales (and future Edward VII). However, Queen Victoria claimed it back in 1885, possibly because of Edward's penchant for leading a dissolute life but more likely his record of only having stayed once at the house and Queen Victoria's need to accommodated her growing extended family. After his marriage in 1863, Bertie stayed every year at Abergeldie, indulging his twin passions of shooting by day and card- games by night. According to an entry in W. E. Gladstone's 1871 diary, Albert Edward one night asked Gladstone to drive over from Balmoral to dine. Gladstone was charmed by his manner, but not his gaming morals. The castle in 1869 The Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland'Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland: A Survey of Scottish Topography, Statistical, Biographical and Historical edited by Francis H. Groome, published 1882‚Äì1885 mentions that the Duchess of Kent spent several autumns here between 1850 and 1861, and that the Empress Eug√©nie passed the October there following the loss of her son the Prince Imperial (1879), and that it was used as a summer residence and shooting box for the then Prince of Wales (who became Edward VII). After the accession of King Edward VII in 1901, it was used by his son the Prince of Wales (later King George V) in 1902. Other members of the royal family who stayed at Abergeldie included the daughters of Edward VII, Princesses Louise, Victoria and Maud of Wales. Birkhall remains in the royal family's possession. Charles, the current Prince of Wales and heir, spends time there with his consort, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. (In Scotland, they use their titles of Duke and Duchess of Rothesay.) Abergeldie Castle is at present occupied by the 21st Laird, John Seton Howard Gordon, Baron of Abergeldie, who has been living there since 1972 (the lands having been previously on lease to the royal family's Balmoral estate, who had their lease on the game lands renewed in the year 2000). In January 2016, the castle was threatened by rising flood waters from the River Dee, which washed away much of the land behind the building, leaving it on a precipice over the river, thus forcing the 76-year-old Baron Abergeldie to flee. For a time, authorities were uncertain if the castle could be saved if the flooding continued. A few days later, structural engineers were confident that shoring efforts would prevent imminent collapse.Simon Johnson: Queen's neighbour's castle 'overhanging 12ft drop to river'. The Daily Telegraph, 5 January 2016 Structure The castle is an imposing building, its oldest part being a turreted square block-tower of the \\"tower house\\" type, with rectangular-plan tower measuring around , with a round stair tower across at the south-west corner. The walls are 4 feet thick, as was common for the unsettled nature of the times. Tradition suggests that the castle was originally surrounded by a moat, but no trace exists today. In the 18th century a wing was added to the 16th-century structure. In the early 19th century an ogee-roofed belfry was built at the top of the stair tower, and a Venetian window inserted in the south fa√ßade. W. D. Simpson noted similarities between Abergeldie and the Castle of Balfluig at Alford, suggesting that they may have shared a designer. The estate grounds extend along Deeside, and consist of 11,700 acres planted with Scotch pine, larch, and birch, mixed in the private grounds with spruce, ash, plane, and sycamore. Ghost The castle is said to be haunted by the spirit of a French serving woman named Catherine (or Kittie) Rankie (or Frankie), also known as French Kate. She was accused of being a witch, and was imprisoned in the cellars before being burned at the stake on nearby Craig-na-Ban (Gaelic Creag-na-Ban ‚Äì Rock of the Women), which overlooks the castle. Since that time, Kate's ghost has been said to have been seen in the cellars and in the clock tower.

Phanes of Halicarnassus () was a wise council man, a tactician, and a mercenary from Halicarnassus, serving the Egyptian pharaoh Amasis II (570‚Äì526 BC). Most of what history recounts of Phanes is from the account of Herodotus in his grand historical text, The Histories. According to Herodotus, Phanes of Halicarnassus was \\"a resourceful man and a brave fighter\\" serving Amasis II on matters of state, and was well connected within the Egyptian pharaoh's troops. Phanes of Halicarnassus was also very well respected within the military and royal community of Egypt. According to Herodotus, a series of events (which he omits to explain, or does not know for sure) led to Phanes of Halicarnassus falling out of favor with Amasis II. Phanes, disgruntled with the pharaoh deserted Egypt and travelled by ship with the intention of speaking with the Persian emperor Cambyses II. When news reached Amasis II, it caused him great anxiety, leading to him sending his most trustworthy eunuch after Phanes, with the intent of capture or assassination. Phanes originally escaped the assassin, but was eventually captured by him in Lycia. Phanes being of wise mind, however managed to escape by getting the eunuch guards drunk and escaping to Persia. Upon his arrival, he met with a resolute Cambyses II who was about to set out to conquer Egypt but was not sure of the best path possible. Knowing of the Egyptian way, Phanes of Halicarnassus wisely advised the Persian king to send a messenger to the Arabian Kings and ask for safe passage to Egypt. Arabs gladly complied blessing Cambyses II on his journey and allowed him a safe passage. Phanes would eventually play a critical role in the strategic advancement of the Persian king who eventually defeated Amasis's son Psamtik III, in the battle of Pelusium in 525 BC. Background Itinerary of Phanes of Halicarnassus, and the itinerary of Persian and Egyptian forces; Persian forces - black line, Egyptian Eunuchs - red line, Phanes of Halicarnassus's travel itinerary - blue line In order to understand the importance of Phanes of Halicarnassus, one has to understand the circumstances surrounding and leading to the battle of Pelusium, and the importance of his council in allowing Cambyses II the easiest path to Egypt. After the defeat of the Lydian, Median, and Neo- Babylonian empire by Cyrus the Great the Persian empire was a powerful empire stretching from the Indus in the east, to the Northern Arabian deserts and Red Sea in the west, right at the door steps of Egypt. Cyrus the Great would die in battle before he could incorporate Egypt into the empire, but it would be his son, Cambyses II's task to conquer the pharaohs. The background against which Herodotus describes the events leading to the Battle of Pelusium require one to understand the political tensions of the time. Herodotus recounts of one possible motive for Cambyses II desire to conquer Egypt: According to Herodotus, Amasis II came to power by bloody means by defeating, and murdering his predecessor pharaoh Apries. While in power, Amasis, was requested by either Cyrus the Great, or Cambyses II for the best Egyptian eye doctor. Amasis II complied, but did so at the expense of forcing the physician to leave his family and children behind and forcibly sent him to Persia. In an attempt to exact revenge for this unjust exile, the Egyptian ophthalmologist, persuaded king Cambyses II to strengthen his bonds with Egypt through marriage with the daughter of Amasis II. Cambyses II complied and asked Amasis II for his daughters's hand in marriage. Unable to let go of his favourite daughter, and unwilling to make an enemy of the mighty Persians, Amasis conducted a trickery during which he sent the daughter of the ex-Pharaoh Apries, whom his death he had facilitated by means of bloody revolt, to Persia as his own daughter. This daughter, Nitetis, who was described by Herodotus as being \\"tall and beautiful\\", was dressed in fine Egyptian clothing and sent to Persia under pretence of the princess of Egypt. Upon arrival, Cambyses II greeted the princess as daughter of Amasis, at which point she exposed Amasis's ill plan and how he had sent the only surviving daughter of the man he had helped murder to wed the king of Persia, under pretence of royal blood. This infuriated Cambyses II, who immediately set out to move toward Egypt to punish Amasis for this insult. It was at this politically tense, moment that Phanes of Halicarnassus arrived at Persia, and gave Cambyses the confidence to invade Egypt for full conquest. Folk story Unrelated to Phanes, Herodotus also describes a few untrue stories that he has heard about the reasons for invasion of Egypt. Herodotus in particular describes a story that he explains is at best an \\"unbelievable\\" concoction about the reason why Cambyses II attacked Egypt. According this version, after the arrival of the Nitetis, Cassandane wife of Cyrus the Great and mother of Cambyses II, must have felt uncomfortable about the tall Egyptian woman. At one point, one of the Persian women who visited Cassandane comments on how beautiful and tall her children including Cambyses II looked at which point Cassandane replies in disdain of the arrival of Nitetis: \\"Although I have borne him children like this, Cyrus treats me with no respect and prefers the new arrival from Egypt\\" at which point Cambyses II, then only ten, who was an audience in the conversation, in defense of Cassandane's honor, says, \\"that is exactly why when I grow up I am going to turn Egypt upside down.\\" Family and fate According to Herodotus, Phanes led Cambyses II to Egypt to face Amasis. Amasis, having died six month before the arrival of the Persian army, was instead represented by his heir and son, Psamtik III (Psammenitus) who had now waged an army of Egyptians anticipating the approaching Persian army. Callous in both strategy, and diplomacy, Psamtik III would lead the Egyptian army to their demise and their eventual siege at Memphis followed by his own capture. Phanes successfully helps lead the Persian armies as an advisor and a mercenary and sees Amasis die of natural causes, and his son chained. This was not to be without tragedy for Phanes however. Herodotus describes that in desperation, and in a violent act to avenge the betrayal, Psamtik III would trick Phanes's sons to see him. He would then kill them all, draining their blood, mixing it with wine, drinking of it and feeding it to all the council members as a sign of what is to come for all those who betray him. Herodotus describes how Psamtik III's lack of diplomacy and violent temper would eventually cost him his life in Persian captivity as he tries to yet again arrange a revolt against Cambyses II, at which point, Cambyses orders his execution. Phanes for most part would stay loyal to Cambyses II after the invasion of Egypt assisting him to come to a diplomatic truce with Libyans. Parties involved with Phanes Cambyses II: King of Persia (Lydia, Babylonia, Persis, Anshan, and Media). Captor and executor of Psamtik III.

It was called and dismissed by the King of Portugal at will, at a place of his choosing.O'Callaghan, J.F. (2003) \\"Cortes, Leon, Castile and Portugal\\" in E.M. Gerli,editor, 2003, Medieval Iberia: an encyclopedia, London: Routledge Cortes which brought all three estates together are sometimes distinguished as Cortes-Gerais (General Courts), in contrast to smaller assemblies which brought only one or two estates, to negotiate a specific point relevant only to them.Coelho da Rocha, M.A. (1851) Ensaio sobre a historia do governo e da legisla√ß√£o de Portugal: para servir de introduc√ß√£o ao estudo do direito patrio Coimbra: Imprensa da Universidade, p.102-03. Portuguese monarchs had always called intermittent \\"king's courts\\" (Curia Regis), consultative assemblies of feudal nobles and landed clerics (bishops, abbots and the masters of the Military Orders) to advise on major matters. This practice probably originated in the protofeudalism of the 6th-century Visigothic Kingdom. But, during the 13th century, with the growing power of municipalities, and kings increasingly reliant on urban militias, incorporated towns gained the right to participate in the king's court. The Cortes assembled at Leiria in 1254 by Afonso III of Portugal was the first known Portuguese Cortes to explicitly include representatives of the municipalities. In this, Portugal was accompanying the pattern in neighboring Iberian kingdoms (e.g. the Kings of Le√≥n admitted town representatives to their Cortes in 1188). Medieval Kings of Portugal continued to rely on small assemblies of notables, and only summoned the full Cortes on extraordinary occasions. A Cortes would be called if the king wanted to introduce new taxes, change some fundamental laws, announce significant shifts in foreign policy (e.g. ratify treaties), or settle matters of royal succession, issues where the cooperation and assent of the towns was thought necessary. Changing taxation (especially requesting war subsidies), was probably the most frequent reason for convening the Cortes. As the nobles and clergy were largely tax-exempt, setting taxation involved intensive negotiations between the royal council and the burgher delegates at the Cortes. Delegates (procuradores) not only considered the king's proposals, but, in turn, also used the Cortes to submit petitions of their own to the royal council on a myriad of matters, e.g. extending and confirming town privileges, punishing abuses of officials, introducing new price controls, constraints on Jews, pledges on coinage, etc. The royal response to these petitions became enshrined as ordinances and statutes, thus giving the Cortes the aspect of a legislature. These petitions were originally referred to as aggravamentos (grievances) then artigos (articles) and eventually capitulos (chapters). In a Cortes-Gerais, petitions were discussed and voted upon separately by each estate and required the approval of at least two of the three estates before being passed up to the royal council. The proposal was then subject to royal veto (either accepted or rejected by the king in its entirety) before becoming law. Nonetheless, the exact extent of Cortes power was ambiguous. Kings insisted on their ancient prerogative to promulgate laws independently of the Cortes. The compromise, in theory, was that ordinances enacted in Cortes could only be modified or repealed by Cortes. But even that principle was often circumvented or ignored in practice. The Cortes probably had their heyday in the 14th and 15th centuries, reaching their apex when the usurping John I of Portugal relied almost wholly upon the bourgeoisie for his power. For a period after the 1383‚Äì1385 Crisis, the Cortes were convened almost annually. But as time went on, they became less important. Portuguese monarchs, tapping into the riches of the Portuguese empire overseas, grew less dependent on Cortes subsidies and convened them less frequently. John II (r.1481-1495) used them to break the high nobility, but dispensed with them otherwise. Manuel I (r.1495-1521) convened them only four times in his long reign. By the time of Sebastian (r.1554‚Äì1578), the Cortes was practically an irrelevance. Curiously, the Cortes gained a new importance with the Iberian Union of 1581, finding a role as the representative of Portuguese interests to the new Habsburg monarch. The Cortes played a critical role in the 1640 Restoration, and enjoyed a brief period of resurgence during the reign of John IV (r.1640-1656). But by the end of the 17th century, it found itself sidelined once again. It is essential, at this point, to remember the fact that there were only four occasions when the Cortes were of immense importance for the History of Portugal: with the coronation of D. Jo√£o I, in the Courts of Coimbra in 1385; with the appointment of D. Pedro, Duque de Coimbra, as regent of D. Afonso V, in the Cortes of Torres Novas of 1438; with the coronation of Filipe I, in Cortes de Tomar, 1581; and, finally, with the acclamation of D. Jo√£o IV, in the Cortes de Lisboa of 1645-1646. All of these occasions, finally confirming the essentially legitimating role of the reigning power. The last Cortes met in 1698, for the mere formality of confirming the appointment of Infante John (future John V) as the successor of Peter II of Portugal. Thereafter, Portuguese kings ruled as absolute monarchs.J.H. Saraiva, (1993) Historia de Portugal p.231 No Cortes were eassembled for over a century. This state of affairs came to an end with the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which set in motion the introduction of a new constitution, and a permanent and proper parliament, that however inheirited the name of Cortes Gerais.  List of Portuguese Cortes  Afonso I (1139‚Äì1185) * 1143 - Cortes of Lamego (legendary) - to confirm D. Afonso Henriques's title as the independent King of Portugal, and establish the rules of succession to the throne. Ostensibly, prevents succession by females if they are married to a foreigner. This has been since proven to be a purely legendary fabrication, invented at the time of the Restoration of 1640. Sancho I (1185‚Äì1211) Afonso II (1211‚Äì1223) * 1211 - Cortes of Coimbra - First definitive Cortes. Established the first general laws (Leis Gerais do Reino), protecting the king's property, stipulating measures of administering justice and the rights of his subjects to be protected from abuses by royal officials and confirming the clerical donations of his predecessor. Also, affirm the validity of canon law for the Church in Portugal, but also introduces the prohibition of the purchase of lands by churches or monasteries (although they can be acquired by donations and legacies). Sancho II (1223‚Äì1248) Afonso III (1248‚Äì1279) * 1254 - Cortes of Leiria - first to include burgher delegates from the incorporated municipalitiesLivermore (1966: p.81) Introduction of the monetagio, a fixed sum paid by the burghers to the Crown as a substitute for the septennium (the traditional revision of the face value of coinage by the Crown every seven years). Also introduce staple laws on the Douro River, favoring the new royal city of Vila Nova de Gaia at the expense of the old episcopal city of Porto. * 1256 - Cortes of Guimar√£es * 1261 - Cortes of Guimar√£es - to discuss the recent debasement of the currency; allow Afonso III's recent debasement, but extract pledges forbidding future debasements. In return for a new property tax, the old \\"septennium\\" is replaced with a new rule allowing only one revision of coinage per reign.Livermore (1966: p.82) * 1273 - Cortes of Santar√©m - to consider Pope Gregory X's bull ordering the restoration of property and rights of Portuguese bishops (seven of the nine Portuguese bishops had formally protested to the pope about the heavy-handed Inquiri√ß√µes Afonsinas, the royal investigations, launched in 1258, into the titles of episcopal lands, ostensibly to \\"recover\\" alienated royal property.) The Cortes find the king has not violated anything. Denis (1279‚Äì1325) * 1282 - Cortes of √âvora - to review a royal offer to Pope Martin V to resolve the episcopal quarrel (the terms are unacceptable to the pope and rejected; documents suggest the offer was originally crafted by the king in consultation with the clergy alone in Guarda, and so the √âvora Cortes may have only been considering a reply to the papal rejection.) Barros (1885: p.264n) * 1283 - Cortes of Coimbra * 1285 - Cortes of Lisbon - to consider renewal of papal demand for restoration of episcopal rights again. Papal position rejected again. Cortes approves a new round of Inquiri√ß√µes, and requests the investigations be extended to the nobility (i.e. review their titular claims to tax-exempt property). Also approves new law forbidding the sale of lands to religious corporations (and forcing them to sell all land acquired since the beginning of his reign). * 1288 - Cortes of Guimar√£es - Cortes reiterates request for inquisitions into noble titles. * 1289 - Cortes of Lisbon - ratify concordat of the Forty Articles with Pope Nicholas V, settling the episcopal question. * 1323 - Cortes of Lisbon Afonso IV (1325‚Äì1357) * 1325 - Cortes of √âvora - enacted sumptuary laws on Jews and Muslims.Lindo (1848, p.305) * 1331 - Cortes of Santar√©m * 1334 - Cortes of Santar√©m - approve marriage of heir Peter to Castilian noblewoman Constance of Pe√±afiel, clearing the way for an interventionist war on behalf of her father, Juan Manuel de Vilhena, against King Alfonso XI of Castile. * 1335 - Cortes of Coimbra * 1340 - Cortes of Santar√©m * 1352 - Cortes of Lisbon - protest against the introduction of ju√≠zes de fora (external judges, nominated and paid for by the crown), as a violation of local charters and customary rights.

He later transferred his loyalty to the Kingdom of Prussia and fought during the French Revolutionary Wars, earning a coveted award for bravery. While serving variously as a staff officer and diplomat, he became renowned as an expert cartographer. In 1806 he was entrusted with command of the forces in northwest Germany. Cut off from the main body of the Prussian army after the disaster at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, he concentrated his troops in the fortress of Hameln. After a brief siege, he surrendered his troops to an inferior force of enemies. For this, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, he was later pardoned and continued his map-making until he went blind. Early career Lecoq was born on 23 September 1754 to a French Huguenot family in Eilenburg in the Electorate of Saxony. His father Johann Ludwig Lecoq (1719‚Äì1789) was a lieutenant general in the Saxon army. (Karl Ludwig's younger brother Karl Christian Erdmann von Lecoq (1767‚Äì1830) also rose to become a lieutenant general in the Saxon army). Joining the Riedesel Infantry Regiment Nr. 10 as a junior Leutnant in 1770, Lecoq rose to the rank of captain by 1779. He transferred to the Prussian army in 1787. Promoted to major, he was appointed to lead the Legat Fusilier battalion Nr. 20, based in Magdeburg. In 1792 he joined the staff of Feldmarschall Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick and fought in the War of the First Coalition at the Battle of Valmy and other actions. For his courageous actions during the Siege of Mainz from 14 April to 23 July 1793, Lecoq was awarded the Pour le M√©rite. One of Lecoq's maps entitled Borkum Another map of Lecoq, (1805) After the Peace of Basel in 1795, Brunswick's army guarded the Prussian frontier in northwest Germany. Lecoq was promoted to Oberstleutnant and appointed Brunswick's Quartermaster General, the equivalent of Chief of Staff. While performing his military duties, he began mapping Westphalia. He was an observer of the French Army of Sambre-et-Meuse during the Rhine Campaign of 1796. On 15 August 1796 he reported to King Frederick William II from Plauen on how Jourdan mangaged his army. Lecoq noted approvingly that 6‚Äì9 pm every evening was devoted to writing up the next day's orders for each division commander, after which orderlies delivered the instructions. He mentioned that the French army had very little equipment and was badly dressed, but that its foot and horse soldiers were robust and its artillery was drawn by good horses. Having won the confidence of Frederick William II and his successor King Frederick William III, Lecoq was sent in 1801 on a diplomatic mission to Saint Petersburg in the Russian Empire. In 1802, he negotiated the transfer of Gerhard von Scharnhorst from the Electorate of Hanover to Prussian service. Inspired by the French cartographer Dominique, comte de Cassini, Lecoq completed his Gro√üe Karte von Westfalen (Great Map of Westphalia) between 1795 and 1805. Already celebrated as a talented map-maker in his own right, the king named him commander-in-chief of the Grenadier Garde Infantry Regiment Nr. 6 in 1801. He was also appointed to a board to examine general staff officer candidates. In 1803, he received promotion to General-major and the following year founded the Junker School.Grosser Generalstab: 1806. Das Preussische Offizierkorps und die Untersuchung der Kriegsereignisse. Berlin, 1906. p. 46 1806 The Battle of Jena-Auerstedt by Richard Kn√∂tel. Before the War of the Fourth Coalition, large Prussian forces were assembled in northwest Germany. Gebhard von Bl√ºcher commanded 16 battalions and 17 squadrons in Westphalia, while 20 battalions and 28 squadrons deployed in the former Electorate of Hanover. Around the beginning of October 1806, the bulk of these forces moved south under the orders of Lieutenant General Bl√ºcher and General of Infantry Ernst von R√ºchel to take position near Eisenach and Gotha. At the time, Bl√ºcher left General- Major von Hagken and General-Major von Brusewitz near M√ºnster to defend Westphalia against a French incursion. Before the war started, Lecoq received command of all forces in the area. Together with the garrisons of Hameln and Nienburg, about 12,000 Prussians defended Hanover and Westphalia. Marshal Mortier by Edouard Dubufe Opposing them were King Louis Bonaparte, leading the army of the Kingdom of Holland, and Marshal √âdouard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier at the fortress of Mainz. Louis placed a strong garrison in the fortress of Wesel with a body of about 6,000 troops hovering to the northeast. Another similar-sized unit was stationed at Utrecht. Mortier's formation was named the VIII Corps and included one division under General of Division Louis Henri Loison. Emperor Napoleon I of France intended for the forces of Louis and Mortier to observe the Prussians until he defeated their main army. Then they would overrun northwest Germany. On 9 October, columns under Lecoq and Hagken began marching west, though progress was slow. Ten days later, news of the catastrophic Battle of Jena-Auerstedt reached Lecoq and he immediately ordered a retreat. When he heard that the broken armies were retreating through the Harz Mountains, he directed his march toward the fortress of Hameln. His and Hagken's columns reached there on 23 October and went into camp. He issued orders to gather food into the city for a siege. The next day, he set out again to the east, hoping to get across the Elbe River and escape the onrushing French. Hearing a report that he was cut off from the Elbe, he gave up on the 27th and marched back to Hameln. However, he detached one infantry battalion and a dragoon regiment under Oberst von Osten in an attempt to get through to Bl√ºcher. Lucchesini Meanwhile, Napoleon gave Louis and Mortier the signal to advance. First, he directed their columns on the neutral state of Hesse-Kassel. Napoleon knew that William I, Elector of Hesse, though officially neutral, was pro-Prussian and he determined to depose him. Mortier's 5,500 men and Louis' troops overran Hesse-Kassel, disarmed the Hessian army, and chased the elector into exile. On 9 November, Louis withdrew from the campaign in bad health, leaving Mortier in command of a 12,000-man corps. Starting on 7 October, French troops moved into the area of Hameln. By the 10th, a good part of Mortier's corps appeared before the city. By this time, Lecoq had the fortifications in good repair and manned them with about 10,000 troops. The city and fortress were well stocked with food and supplies and ready to sustain a siege. Mortier left 6,000 men to maintain the Siege of Hameln and continued his march on Hanover, which he occupied on 12 October. Jean Baptiste Dumonceau commanded the Hameln blockading force which was organized into one cavalry and three infantry brigades with 12 artillery pieces. Mortier did his best to browbeat Lecoq into surrendering, but his initial attempts were unsuccessful. Anne Jean Ren√© Savary Lecoq's 10,000 troops and 175 guns included a 3,058-strong garrison under the 75-year-old General-Major von Sch√∂ler. These troops comprised the 3rd battalions of the Schenck Infantry Regiment Nr. 9, Tschammer Infantry Regiment Nr. 27, Hagken Infantry Regiment Nr. 44 and Hessen Infantry Regiment Nr. 48. Two battalions of the Oranien Infantry Regiment Nr. 19 rounded out the garrison. The remainder of Lecoq's force consisted of four Invalid companies from the first four regiments, 40 hussars, 181 artillerists, 1,000 fugitives from Jena- Auerstedt and recruit drafts from the Treuenfels Infantry Regiment Nr. 29 and the Strachwitz Infantry Regiment Nr. 43. While these operations were in progress, Napoleon signed an armistice with the king's envoy Girolamo Lucchesini that specified that the remaining Prussian fortresses were to be surrendered. King Frederick William III later refused to sign the document, but that did not stop the French emperor from trying to exploit the tentative agreement. He sent Anne Jean Marie Ren√© Savary to Hameln with the information in an attempt to coax the garrison into laying down its arms. On 19 November, Savary arrived at Hameln and was granted a parley with Lecoq and his generals. Putting his diplomatic talent to good use, he reminded the generals that there was no Prussian field army within 400 kilometers. After he revealed the conditions of the armistice, Lecoq decided to capitulate. The surrender terms were similar to those at the Capitulation of Prenzlau in that officers were to be paroled and the enlisted men were to be made prisoners. When Lecoq's rank and file found out about the capitulation, a mutiny broke out and the soldiers forced their way into wine-shops and soon became drunk. Robbery, looting and other disorders followed. For their part, the officers demanded that they be paid and that their troops be paroled. There are two versions of what happened next. In one account, Savary turned his cavalry loose in the streets to drive the Prussians out of the city. Once outside the city they were surrounded and disarmed. In the second account, 9,000 soldiers dispersed into the countryside in the confusion and only 600 were marched into captivity after the 22 November capitulation. On 26 November, the fortress of Nienburg capitulated with its 2,911-man garrison. Historian Digby Smith called the surrender \\"shameful\\". Francis Loraine Petre believed that Lecoq's situation was hopeless, but that it was his responsibility to hold out as long as possible. A long siege might have kept a substantial French force from being used in the winter campaign. Later career In 1809, Lecoq faced an inquiry into the surrender of the fortress. Sentenced to life in prison, he was sent to Spandau. However, he was allowed to live mostly in the city rather than in a prison cell. In 1812, the king refused his request for clemency, though he was permitted to visit his estate in Pichelsdorf near Berlin. After Prussia joined the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1813, he was allowed to live in Oranienburg. In 1814 he was finally pardoned and took up residence in Berlin where he continued work on his beloved maps as his eyesight faded away. Lecoq's wife Marie Charlotte Lautier (b. 1760) died in 1826. The couple had four children, of whom two daughters survived until adulthood. Completely blind, Lecoq died in Berlin on 14 February 1829 and was buried in the French cemetery.

SMUG advocates for the protection and promotion of human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Ugandans. A network composed of several member organizations was founded in 2004: * Icebreakers Uganda, concerned with LGBT research and youth issues. * Freedom & Roam Uganda, dedicated to the rights of lesbian, transgender, and intersex women * Spectrum Uganda, focused on the health and well-being of LGBT people in Uganda (co- founded by John \\"Longjones\\" Abdallah Wambere) *Transgender Initiative Uganda addresses transgender issues. History Victor Mukasa, a trans man activist, founded Sexual Minorities Uganda on 3 March 2004 in Kampala at the Kaival restaurant and Internet cafe. The earliest members included Val Kalende. Kamuhangire.E and David Kato, who were among the first board members. Members of SMUG achieved controversy through their activism and legal troubles for much of the organization's history, and the profile of the organization in the later-2000s due to the rise of homophobic populism in the country and the introduction of the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill in the Parliament by David Bahati. The Ugandan newspaper Rolling Stone, a publication unrelated to the American magazine of the same name, which rejected the Ugandan paper and called its actions as \\"horrific\\", published a gallery of \\"100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak\\" and stated \\"Hang Them\\",\\"Gays in Uganda say they're living in fear\\", Godfrey Olukya & Jason Straziuso, NBC News, Associated Press\\"Ugandan paper calls for gay people to be hanged\\", Xan Rice, guardian.co.uk, 21 October 2010 In response, four members of SMUG whose faces appeared in the magazine, David Kato Kisule, Kasha Nabagesera, Nabirye Mariam, and Pepe Julian Onziema \\"Patience\\", filed a petition with the High Court seeking to force the paper to cease distribution of the article. The court granted the petition on 2 November 2010, effectively ending the publication of Ugandan Rolling Stone.\\"Uganda court orders anti-gay paper to shut\\", Reuters, 2 November 2010\\"Judge orders Ugandan paper to stop publishing 'gay lists'\\", CNN International, 2 November 2010 On 26 January 2011, Kato, whose picture had been featured on the cover of the issue of Rolling Stone in question, was assaulted in his home in Mukono Town by his acquaintance Sidney Nsubuga Enoch, 22, who hit him twice in the head with a hammer found in Kato's bathroom before fleeing on foot. The apparent motive was a disagreement about sexual services and robbery. Kato died en route to the Kawolo Hospital. The murder was decried by Human Rights Watch and senior Africa researcher Maria Burnett said that \\"David Kato's death is a tragic loss to the human rights community\\". On 15 September 2011, SMUG's executive director Frank Mugisha was named the recipient of the annual Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award for his activism. Mugisha also received the Rafto Prize for Human Rights on behalf of SMUG on 6 September 2011. In 2012, SMUG and several Ugandans, including Onziema, Mukasa, and Mugisha, together with the Center for Constitutional Rights initiated legal action in U.S. Federal District Court using the Alien Tort Statute to sue American evangelist Scott Lively for crimes against humanity for his work on the Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Bill. Lively's work has been described as inciting the persecution of gay men and lesbians and as \\"conduct ... actively trying to harm and deprive other people of their rights\\". In August 2013, Judge Michael A. Ponsor ruled that the plaintiffs were on solid ground under international and federal law in rejecting a jurisdictional challenge to the suit. He also ruled that First Amendment defenses for Lively's conduct were premature.

It is a version of equicontinuity used in the context of functions of random variables: that is, random functions. The property relates to the rate of convergence of sequences of random variables and requires that this rate is essentially the same within a region of the parameter space being considered. For instance, stochastic equicontinuity, along with other conditions, can be used to show uniform weak convergence, which can be used to prove the convergence of extremum estimators.

Based on the ancient text of Roman law, the Corpus iuris civilis, it added many new concepts, and formed the basis of the later civil law systems that prevail in the vast majority of countries. Some exceptions are, for example, common law countries of the English-speaking world Rediscovery of ancient Roman law Although some legal systems in southern Europe in the Early Middle Ages, such as the Visigothic Code, retained some features of ancient Roman law, the main texts of Roman law were little known until the rediscovery of the Digest in Italy in the late 11th century. It was soon apparent that the Digest was a massive intellectual achievement and that the assimilation of its contents would require much time and study. The first European university, the University of Bologna, was set up in large part with the aim of studying it.Berman, Law and Revolution, ch. 3; Stein, Roman Law in European History, part 3. The era of the glossators The ancient Roman law texts were not very explicit about matters of principle, and the commentators found it necessary to develop the scholastic method of comparing potentially conflicting texts and inferring principles that would explain the apparent contradictions. The commentators of the 12th and early 13th centuries, called glossators, such as Azo of Bologna and Accursius, produced large-scale harmonization of and commentary on the texts. They developed new concepts by reflecting on different related texts, such as the concept of half-proof in the law of evidence.Franklin, Science of Conjecture, ch. 2. Many of these glosses or interpretations, were compiled into one text around 1220 by the famous glossator Franciscus Accursius. This text was known as the Glossa Ordinaria and was a compilation of the most important commentaries made by the glossators. Initially the rediscovered Roman law was not the law of any particular country or institution, but as lawyers trained in the concepts of Roman law came to dominate the legal profession, Roman law came to have an immense effect on law as actually practiced. For example, torture was reintroduced into Europe as a means of acquiring evidence, usually when there was half-proof or more against a defendant but not yet sufficient proof for conviction. English law incorporated a substantial amount of Roman concepts through the works of Glanvill and Bracton.Stein, Roman Law in European History, p. 64. But it adopted the non-Roman jury system as the main form of evidence evaluation, thus remaining less influenced by Roman law than continental systems. However, some English courts, such as the Court of Admiralty, operated on Roman law principles. Canon law, the law of the Roman Catholic Church which governed such matters as marriage, developed in parallel with medieval Roman law and incorporated many of its concepts. The era of the postglossators The postglossators of the 14th century, such as Bartolus de Saxoferato and Baldus de Ubaldis, developed a more mature and deeper legal theory, less closely tied to the ancient texts. That gave the law sufficient flexibility to incorporate new concepts. For example, the first printed book on insurance was the Roman law treatise On Insurance and Merchants' Bets by Pedro de Santar√©m (Santerna), written in 1488 and published in 1552.Franklin, Science of Conjecture, p. 277. Later influence Roman law often acted (except in England) as a \\"common law\\" (ius commune) that filled the gap where local laws were silent, as well as supplying principles of interpretation for those laws in doubtful cases.Bellomo, The common legal past of Europe. In this way, Scots law was heavily influenced by Roman law from the 15th century. Roman law was in part incorporated in later codifications of continental law such as the Napoleonic Code and hence formed a core of their successors, the civil law systems of modern European and other countries. Roman law also had wide influence on Western political theory. Questions such as the scope and limits of government and the permissibility of tyrannicide were seen in legal terms and discussed by writers whose primary training was in law.Pennington, The Prince and the Law; Canning, The Political Thought of Baldus de Ubaldis. These ideas formed the basic of modern constitutionalism, the idea that government should be bound by fixed legal norms. Bibliography *Manlio Bellomo. The Common Legal Past of Europe, 1000-1800.

Today there are two populations in Hernando County and probably three in Hillsborough River State Park. At the time the plant was listed as an endangered species of the United States in 1989, it was known from three small populations on wet prairies that were threatened by changes in the local hydrology and by pollution.USFWS. Endangered status for four Florida plants. Federal Register July 27, 1989. It was also thought to be threatened by vandalism, trampling, and collecting by flower enthusiasts. Cattle grazing and invasion of the habitat by the exotic skunkvine (Paederia foetida) also degrade the habitat.The Nature Conservancy This is an annual herb with slender, sometimes branching stems reaching 15 centimeters in height. The stems have slight winglike ridges, and the stem nodes may root if they come in contact with moist substrate. Leaves are variable in size and shape. The bell-shaped purple flower is 3 millimeters to one centimeter in length. This plant grows in moist to wet prairie habitat, often near ponds, or sometimes in seeps in remnant hardwood forest stands. More populations of the plant have been discovered since it was first evaluated for the endangered species list, but they are all threatened by destruction and degradation of the habitat. This applies to the four populations that are located on protected, conserved land, as well as one population that is on private property. The latter population will likely be destroyed when the land is cleared for construction of housing. The protected areas have undergone several years of drought conditions that have been unfavorable to the plant, which thrives in wet years. Surface runoff has been found to contaminate the local water, sometimes increasing the nutrients such that non-native plant species are likely to increase. A 2010 review indicated that the plant's situation still warrants endangered status for now.

He is best known for his 1979 escape from Pretoria Local Prison (part of the Pretoria Central Prison complex), along with Stephen Lee and Alex Moumbaris. Biography =Early life and education= Jenkin was born in Cape Town and educated at Rondebosch Boys' Prep and Boys' High School, matriculating aged 17. After leaving school, he avoided conscription into the South African Defence Force, and worked at a variety of jobs for two years, with no particular interest in anything except motorcycle racing. He left for the UK in 1970, where, working in a fibreglass factory under poor working conditions and little pay, found the system unjust and developed an interest in sociology. This led to learning more about the injustice in his own country. He later wrote that he had \\"grown up a 'normal' complacent white South African\\" who \\"unthinkingly accepted the system and for twenty-one years never questioned it\\". At the end of 1970 Jenkin enrolled at the University of Cape Town (UCT) and graduated with a Bachelor of Social Science degree at the end of 1973. =Early political activities= Jenkin met Stephen Lee in a sociology class at UCT. They became friends and both sought out literature banned by the apartheid government, reading, photocopying and swapping it with other students. They both found their sociology course disappointing, as the material reinforced the status quo of the apartheid system. Through reading, including material banned by the government, they came to see the \\"naked reality\\" of apartheid and the undemocratic nature of the government, and felt a burning desire to effect positive change, which, Jenkin concluded, was only possible using unconstitutional means under the current regime. During this time they learnt of the activities of the African National Congress (ANC), which was a banned organisation in South Africa. In February 1974, Jenkin and Lee left the country in order to join the ANC in London, with the intention of helping to bring about change in South Africa. Here Jenkin met his future wife Robin. While awaiting clearance for membership, Jenkin worked as a social worker at a reform school in Swindon. After acceptance by the ANC, he and Lee received training from the ANC in various tactics, in particular how to spread their propaganda material in the form of leaflets, and how to set up communication and financial structures. Upon return to Cape Town in July 1975, Lee and Jenkin bought a typewriter, duplicator and stationery to print and post pamphlets and leased first a garage and then a tiny apartment. Jenkin worked as a researcher for the Institute for Social Development at the University of the Western Cape, which was a university for people classified by the apartheid government as Coloured. In March 1976 Lee went to Johannesburg to look for work, and the ANC coincidentally sent them both on their first mission, to disperse leaflets urging support for the ANC and unity in the liberation struggle via a leaflet bomb (using a new design developed by Jenkin) in Johannesburg, close to the anniversary of the Sharpeville Massacre on 21 March. After achieving this mission, managing to distribute hundreds of leaflets by means of several leaflet bombs, the text of which is reproduced in Jenkin's memoir. After the success of their first mission, Jenkin worked on refining the mechanism by adding a triggering system to the leaflet bomb, so that they did not have to be close to it when it went off. He successfully distributed leaflets this way on Cape Town's Grand Parade. Lee worked for the University of the Witwatersrand, while Jenkin ran the \\"cell\\" on his own in Cape Town. Jenkin went to London at the request of the ANC in May 1976, while Lee continued to plant leaflet bombs around Johannesburg. In July, four ANC operatives including author Jeremy Cronin were arrested doing similar work in Cape Town and were given prison sentences. Undeterred, Jenkin continued the work in Cape Town, finding a new premises and regularly changing their printing equipment, and both carried out further leaflet bombings in Johannesburg. There were a few worrying signs that Jenkin was being monitored, but he went to London to see Robin for six weeks and returned without incident. In September, he and Lee hung a 10-metre-long banner with the words \\"ANC LIVES\\" from a high building in the centre of Cape Town, along with a timed device which distributed hundreds of leaflets over the crowds below. Lee moved back to Cape Town in December after enrolling in a master's degree in sociology, and the two continued their undercover work, but unbeknownst to them they were by this time under surveillance by police. =Arrest and prison= At 3am on 2 March 1978, they were both arrested, after being seen moving their printing equipment into their own dwelling. They were never told how the security police got onto them, and Jenkin concluded that it must have been the result of meticulous police work and long surveillance. They were taken to Caledon Square Police Station, the head office of the Security Branch in Cape Town, where they were separated, interrogated and put into cells, without being informed of the charges or their rights. This was legal under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act, which allowed detention without trial for up to 60 days, and was extendable. Lee made an escape attempt and nearly succeeded. After a spell in the notorious John Vorster Square in Johannesburg, they were returned to Cape Town and after four weeks, allowed to see family, and held at Pollsmoor Prison as they awaited trial. After Lee's father brought him a copy of the book Papillon, the book inspired them to seriously consider the prospect of escape and they concentrated on rigorous observations of the world around them. Along with Lee, Jenkin was charged with \\"producing and distributing 18 different pamphlets on behalf of banned organisations\\" including the South African Communist Party, the ANC and its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, from 1975 to 1978, and urging people to join the liberation movement. The trial in the Cape Town Supreme Court from 6 to 15 June 1978. Upon legal advice, both pleaded guilty to all charges. They were both found guilty on one charge, with Jenkin receiving a 12-year sentence and Lee eight. Escape After their incarceration, Jenkin, Lee and several other inmates began plotting an escape, which would involve copies of several prison keys that Jenkin made from wood. Jenkin had smuggled some money into prison. The initial plan was that eight of the political prisoners would escape, leaving behind two who were nearing the end of their sentences. One of the intending escapees, Denis Goldberg, communicated with comrades in the ANC through coded letters sent to Baruch Hirson in London. Hirson then communicated with Joe Slovo in Mozambique, a date for the escape was set and an escape vehicle arranged. As the plan evolved it became clear that for the escape to be successful it would have to be restricted to three people, who would have to hide in a small closet at one point. The escape preparations brought some differences of opinion amongst the political prisoners, but they remained comrades and all contributed in some way to the escape effort. The fact that they were all in prison for their political activities and beliefs united them, and \\"as members of a revolutionary organisation [they] were disciplined and shared in [their] suffering collectively\\". Goldberg and the others decided to withdraw from the escape, with Goldberg continuing to be involved in the preparations. In December 1979, Jenkin, Lee and fellow inmate Alex Moumbaris broke out of Pretoria Central Prison using handmade keys to nine of the doors leading out of the prison, after several hair-raising moments after encountering unforeseen obstacles. Goldberg distracted the warden while the three made their escape. The street was deserted, but they still had to find their way out of South Africa, into Mozambique and to freedom. This had involved a great deal of prior planning, but there were still many challenges in the execution, travelling via Angola, Zambia and Tanzania finally to London. =Life after prison= Jenkin and Lee appeared at a press conference in Lusaka with Oliver Tambo on 2 January 1980 to tell their stories, before moving to London, where Jenkin worked as a research officer for the International Defence and Aid Fund. He and Lee went on a speaking tour in Sweden in the early 1980s. When living in Camden, still with the ANC, he devised a system for encrypted communication for the ANC to communicate with their agents. Messages were typed into a computer, encrypted and saved to audio cassette, then sent from a public callbox to an answering machine. The system was never cracked and helped the ANC coordinate in the run up to Nelson Mandela's release from prison. He returned to South Africa in 1991 to manage the ANC's communications network. He worked for the ANC Elections Briefing Unit from 1994 (the year of the first fully democratic elections in South Africa), before being appointed head of their Electronic Information Unit in Cape Town later that year. In 1997, he became a director of Unwembi Communications (Pty) Ltd. Around the turn of the millenium he co-founded the Community Exchange System, an internet-based moneyless exchange for local communities, comparable to LETS, writing all the software for it, . A decade later he also created Clearing Central a 2nd tier exchange for moneyless exchange between the groups. In 2015 and went on a national tour in Australia organised by Karel Boele speaking about his escape and community currencies. Recognition *In 2007 he was elected an Ashoka fellow for his ongoing work on the Community Exchange System. *In April 2018 he was awarded the RSA Conference Award for Excellence in the Field of Humanitarian Service. Books, TV and film In 1987, his book Escape from Pretoria, was published in London. A new edition was published in Johannesburg and London as Inside Out : Escape from Pretoria Prison in 2003. In 1995, Jenkin wrote a 6-part article series called Talking to Vula: The Story of the Secret Underground Communications Network of Operation Vula. In 2013, the story of the prison escape was dramatised in the 7th episode of the 2nd season of Breakout, a television series made by National Geographic TV channel dramatising real-life prison escapes. The video features excerpts from interviews with Jenkin, Lee, Moumbaris and Goldberg filmed in 2012, in between re-enacted scenes of the prison escape. In 2014 a documentary film called The Vula Connection, about Jenkin and his part in the creation of an ingenious secret communication system that enabled Vula operatives to penetrate South Africa's borders in secret, ultimately smuggling messages to the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, was made by Marion Edmunds. In May 2017, it was announced that production would start on a film of Jenkin's book, produced by David Barron and starring Daniel Radcliffe as Jenkin and Ian Hart as Goldberg. Filming of Escape from Pretoria began in Adelaide, South Australia, in March and April 2019, with Daniel Webber joining the cast as Lee. Jenkin spent some time in Adelaide, advising Radcliffe on accent and other aspects of the film, as well as playing as an extra, playing a prisoner next to Radcliffe in the visiting room. The film was released on 6 March 2020, first in the UK and USA and then in the rest of the world. He also participated in a local parkrun, a hobby which he said stemmed back from his days of running to keep fit in prison.

History The lighthouse was designed by Quirinus Harder and construction began on 25 July 1863. The lighthouse was built on top of a 20-metre high sand dune, and was lit on 1 November 1864. At that time, the distance from the lighthouse to the sea was 3 kilometres. Initially the lighthouse had a kerosene lamp. The current (electrical) lamp is a 2000 watt Philips fluorescent lamp, producing 2.85 million candela, and the light is focused with a number of Fresnel lenses. It has two automatically engaged spare lamps. The lighthouse was originally red, but in the course of time that colour faded to pink. In 1977 the tower was covered with a red plastic coating. Since 1982 the lighthouse is a Rijksmonument. During the Georgian Uprising of Texel of April 1945 the lighthouse suffered heavy damage. It was repaired by constructing a new wall around it and a new upper-level construction. In this process the lighthouse lost two of its original nine storeys. During the 1990s the lighthouse, including the very top and the lamp, was open for visitors. Closed for a while, it was reopened in 2009 and is accessible up to the sixth floor.

Trumbo was considered an expert on the McCarthy-era Hollywood blacklist. His father, screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, was blacklisted by Hollywood for nearly a decade for refusing to testify to Congress, as one of a group known as The Hollywood Ten. Early life Trumbo was born on September 25, 1940, to Dalton and Cleo Trumbo. He was raised in Los Angeles. Trumbo was seven years old when his father was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. His father spent ten months in prison before being released in 1951. The family moved to Mexico City to share a place with the screenwriter Hugo Butler, who was also blacklisted, and his family. The Trumbos returned to California after two years in Mexico and settled in Highland Park. Trumbo graduated from Franklin High School in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. He enrolled at Columbia University. He took a year off from Columbia to work as an assistant director on the 1960 film Exodus, which was written by his father, Dalton Trumbo, and directed by Otto Preminger. Trumbo received a bachelor's degree from Columbia College in 1964. Career Trumbo began working as a television and film screenwriter in 1967. Trumbo co-wrote the film The Don Is Dead (1973), starring Anthony Quinn, as well as the John Wayne film Brannigan (1975). In 1974, he was the co-creator with Michael Butler of the short-lived ABC police drama Nakia, and he also wrote for the series. In 1978, Trumbo wrote the television film Ishi: The Last of His Tribe, in which he co-credited his father, who died in 1976. Trumbo's other credits included television episodes of Falcon Crest, Ironside and Quincy, M.E.. Trumbo wrote a play based on his father's blacklist-era letters, called Trumbo: Red, White and Blacklisted. The play, which focuses on Dalton Trumbo's blacklist experience through his personal letters, was adapted as an off-Broadway production directed by Peter Askin. Askin's Trumbo: Red, White and Blacklisted, which starred Nathan Lane as Dalton Trumbo and Gordon MacDonald as the narrator, opened at the Westside Theatre in New York City. The production ran for approximately one year. Lane departed the production and several well-known actors took on the role of Dalton Trumbo, including Chris Cooper, Gore Vidal, Richard Dreyfuss, F. Murray Abraham, Bill Irwin and Brian Dennehy. Dennehy later starred in a national tour of the play. Christopher Trumbo and Peter Askins collaborated to create the film Trumbo (2007), which was also based on Dalton Trumbo's letters. The film combined documentary footage with performances by Nathan Lane, Brian Dennehy, Liam Neeson, Donald Sutherland and Paul Giamatti. Trumbo was considered an expert on the Hollywood blacklist era. He was often cited in books and appeared in documentaries concerning the subject, including the seven-part Moguls and Movie Stars, which aired on Turner Classic Movies in 2010. Trumbo was writing a history of the Hollywood blacklist at the time of his death in 2011. Death Trumbo died of cancer in hospice care at his home in Ojai, California on January 8, 2011, at the age of 70, the same age at which his father died. He was survived by his wife, Nancy Escher; his sisters, Nikola Trumbo and Mitzi Trumbo. Before he died, he requested that his father receive full credit for his work on Roman Holiday, which won an Oscar. On December 19, 2011, the Writers Guild credited Dalton Trumbo with the screenplay posthumously.

The species was described by Peter Ren√© Oscar Bally in 1943. Etymology The specific epithet is derived from the Latin pinguis, meaning \\"fat\\", attributed to the shape of the leaves.  Characteristics  =Habit= Dracaena pinguicula is a short, erect plant resembling a dwarf agave. It is best known for its growing habit: unlike most related species, which grow from an underground rhizome, this species produces aerial stolons which terminate in new plantlets. These then produce stilt-like roots that extend downward to the ground, resulting in a plant that appears to be walking away from its parent. =Foliage= The blue-green leaves of D. pinguicula are covered in a thick waxy cuticle, and contain the deepest stomata of any former Sansevieria species. The leaves are arranged in a rosette and lunate in cross section. The leaves can be 12‚Äì30 cm in length, 2.8‚Äì3.5 cm thick, and are tipped with a single sharp spine. A wide channel runs the full length of each leaf and has reddish-brown margins edged with tough, papery white cuticle The underside of each leaf is smooth when water is plentiful but develops deep longitudinal grooves in drier conditions as the plant draws upon the water stored in its leaves, allowing it to survive in one of the most arid regions of Kenya. =Roots= Stilt-like roots holding a young plantlet above the surface. The stolon is visible to the right. The defining characteristic of D. pinguicula are its thick stilt-like roots. Each rosette produces several of these roots, which can elevate the plant several inches off the ground and are covered in a thick brown cuticle. Fine roots are produced underground and are responsible for nutrient and moisture absorption. During the dry season, the fine roots will die, and the plant will enter dormancy. However, the thick succulent roots survive and the plant will resume growth once the wet season arrives and the roots regrow. =Flowers= Flowers are borne in clusters of 5‚Äì6 on an erect branched panicle 15‚Äì32 cm long. The flower bracts are small, brownish and bottle shaped with white anthers and stamens. Fertilized flowers produce globular berries, however very few fruit mature to produce seed. The flower spike develops from the apical meristem and a rosette will no longer grow after blooming. However, the rosette will not die after flowering, and will instead produce many stolons bearing young plantlets. Cultivation Young plant in cultivation Dracaena pinguicula is extremely slow growing and requires warm temperatures to grow. It is therefore difficult to find in cultivation. Variegated specimens are highly prized but rarely arise, and are sold at high prices. Normal specimens are more common but still highly sought after due to their unique growing habit. =Soil and water= In cultivation, D. pinguicula, like most xerophytic plants, grows best in porous, well drained soil. Excessive watering will cause the fleshy roots to rot, so it is essential that the soil is allowed to dry sufficiently between waterings. Many growers prefer a coarse potting mix consisting of a combination of inorganic and organic ingredients. Gravel, perlite, vermiculite, and decomposed granite are commonly used to add weight and improve drainage, while bark chips and coconut coir or husks are used for moisture retention. Such a porous mix will prevent over watering and provide ample aeration, but requires more frequent watering to prevent over drying. =Temperature= D. pinguicula will die if temperatures drop below 7 ¬∞C with wet soil. However, it can survive near freezing temperatures if the soil is dry. The plant grows best in warm daytime temperatures from 25‚Äì35 ¬∞C with cooler night temperatures from 10‚Äì20 ¬∞C. =Light= D. pinguicula will survive in a wide range of light conditions from direct outdoor sunlight to deep shade indoors. Under low light conditions the leaves may become etiolated, evident through a darker green colouration of the leaves, which become longer and thinner than usual. D. pinguicula grows best in bright light for 12‚Äì16 hours a day. In higher latitudes, many botanical gardens with specimen plants induce dormancy by stopping watering during the winter, when days are too short to sustain normal growth. This cycle roughly emulates the wet and dry seasons of the plant in habitat. Propagation Most related species seldom set seed, and commercial species such as Dracaena trifasciata are typically grown using micropropagation. However, since D. pinguicula grows so slowly, micropropagation is unprofitable. Therefore, vegetative propagation by division or by leaf cutting is the preferred method. =Division= This can be done by removing and rooting the plantlets produced at the end of each stolon. Since the plantlets grow a rosette of leaves before beginning root growth, when rooting plantlets, it is very important that plantlet is not removed before it has developed stilt roots to a length of at least 3 cm. If removed too soon, the plantlet will not have the energy or water reserves to produce roots before dying. Once stilt roots have been grown to sufficient length, however, the stolon can be cut at any point and the new plant can be potted in slightly moist porous soil. Depending on conditions, a plantlet can take anywhere from a few weeks to almost a year before producing new roots, and may take even longer to grow fine roots and become established. Division is the preferred method for propagating most specimens, and in particular, variegated specimens, since leaf cuttings typically do not preserve the variegation. =Leaf cutting= Leaf cutting is typically used once rosettes have already flowered, in which case they will no longer grow. Whole leaves can be cut from the rosette and set aside for several days to allow the cut to dry. At this point the leaf can be inserted cut-side down into moist porous potting medium to root. Over time, the leaf will produce roots and a stolon from the cut which will bear a new plant at its tip. Since variegation is produced through rare somatic mutations in the apical meristem, this is the preferred method for generating variegated specimens due to the volume of leaves which can be rooted simultaneously.

It was released on January 16, 1979, after the release of the Jacksons studio album Destiny a month earlier. Boogie is considered the rarest of all Jackson 5/Jacksons releases, as not many albums were pressed and fewer were sold at the time. Background and composition In 1979, the Jacksons moved up in the Top 10 with the album Destiny, released by Epic, and the hit \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)\\". Michael Jackson began recording Off the Wall that year, and Motown wanted to cash in on the newfound success with Boogie on the Natural Resources label. Five of the seven songs are unpublished productions by Hal Davis; some are in the line of \\"Pride and Joy\\" on Joyful Jukebox Music as \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\" and \\"Love's Gone Bad\\". The sweetness of \\"One Day I'll Marry You\\", following the sessions for \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\", might have its place in albums like Maybe Tomorrow and Got to Be There. \\"Oh, I've Been Blessed\\" is produced by Bobby Taylor, recorded in the early beginnings of Motown group. \\"Penny Arcade\\" is the vein of Lookin' Through the Windows. Boogie, along with Joyful Jukebox Music, was distributed for a very short period, and the album remains the rarest of the Jackson 5. In 2004, it was available for a limited time from Hip-O Select, to complement Motown's 2001 \\"2 Albums on 1 CD\\" re- issue set of the Jackson 5's albums, on which some of these songs were issued as bonus tracks. Although only 5,000 copies were pressed, the album contains the previously unreleased full 15+ minute take of the song \\"Hum Along and Dance\\". It was available for purchase on iTunes in 2014, but was since removed.Joyful Jukebox Music / Boogie - iTunes Two of the tracks on Boogie, \\"Love's Gone Bad\\" and \\"I Was Made to Love Her\\", were later featured on Michael Jackson's 1986 compilation album, Looking Back to Yesterday.

The mission also aimed to establish a peace with the local populace so that a road could be safely built through the area by the Afghan government. Over the course of the operation, a series of running battles occurred with members of the Taliban, as well as with local tribesmen. U.S. Army Paratrooper Salvatore Giunta would be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during combat between U.S. forces and local Afghans. Background The U.S. had struggled for some time to establish itself as a force within the valley. Long considered to be a Taliban stronghold, the Korengal Valley was nicknamed the \\"Valley of Death\\" by U.S. forces due to the dangers associated with being stationed there, with sometimes as many as a dozen firefights per day. Spearheaded by Captain Louis Frketic of A Company and Captain Dan Kearney of B Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment (Airborne) of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team in the Korengal Valley, the goal of the assault was to both disrupt Taliban and insurgent routes of transit in the area, as well as trying to establish a peace with local village elders by offering to build them a new highway through the mountains ‚Äî paid for by the Afghan government ‚Äî in exchange for information about anti-governmental combatants. The Operation Operation Rock Avalanche began in the early-morning hours of 19 October 2007 when U.S. and Afghan forces boarded UH-60 and CH-47 helicopters at the Korengal Outpost (KOP) to be inserted in the southern portion of the Korengal Valley, near the village of Yaka Chine. This main force consisted mostly of B Company, 2-503rd Infantry, but also included support elements, such as U.S. Air Force Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC), and a Low-Level Voice Intercept (LLVI) team from the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. Elements from A, C, and D companies, 2-503 Infantry, also occupied blocking positions around the valley in an effort to prevent Taliban forces from leaving the area. There were several skirmishes early in the operation, ultimately leading to AC-130 and AH-64 gunships firing into the village, resulting in civilian casualties. The night of the 21st, U.S. forces moved east to conduct operations near the villages of Landigal and Aliabad. Mid-day on the 23rd, Taliban forces attacked and overran a U.S. machine gun position, killing Staff Sergeant Rougle and wounding Sergeants Rice and Velaquez, before being forced to withdraw. Taliban forces were also able to capture several weapons and equipment from the fallen Americans. U.S. and Afghan forces continued to patrol the area and meet with village elders, resulting in several more firefights and large amounts of U.S. air and artillery support being employed. As the sun set on the 25th, U.S. and Afghan forces began concluding the operation. During their egress, Taliban forces initiated an \\"L\\" shaped ambush against 1st and 3rd Platoon, B Company. U.S. forces were able to break out of the killzone and launch a successful counter- attack, but only after two Americans were killed and five more wounded. Taliban leader Muhammad Tali was killed by U.S. Army's SPC Giunta, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the engagement. Outcome While Taliban forces were able to launch bold attacks against U.S. forces, they were unable to maintain their momentum. Coalition forces inflicted heavy casualties upon the Taliban, including several local leaders. Coalition forces also were able to locate several stone bunkers on the Abas Ghar, as well as firing positions used in attacks against the Korengal Outpost. Taliban activity in the Korengal Valley dropped significantly in the months following the operation. In April 2010, U.S. forces withdrew from the Korengal Valley. 42 Americans had died fighting there, with over a hundred more wounded. Popular culture The events of the offensive were witnessed firsthand by American journalist Sebastian Junger and British photojournalist Tim Hetherington, and were captured on film for their Academy Award-nominated documentary Restrepo.An up-close yet impersonal look at war, Wesley Morris, Boston Globe movie review. Among other awards, the film received the Grand Jury Prize for best documentary at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Junger would later go on to write the book War, an account which expanded upon his experiences during Operation Rock Avalanche.

The journalists were Kevin Carter, Greg Marinovich, Ken Oosterbroek, and Jo√£o Silva. The book was co-authored by two of the journalists, Greg Marinovich and Jo√£o Silva.  History  In the years between 1990 and 1994 the fight from apartheid to democracy in South Africa was extremely violent. About the members of the Bang Bang Club was much written at this time and later too. But the stories painted a picture \\"of a group of hard-living men who worked, played and hung out together pretty much all of the time\\", how Greg Marinovich wrote in the preface of the book. The next sentence started with the words: \\"Let us set the record straight: ‚Ä¶\\" In 1997 started Marinovich and Joao Silva to write the book. In the acknowledgments were mentioned the many Impimpi ‚Äì informants who contributed to the book. Impimpi is a Zulu word and in the glossary of the book it is translated as \\"spy\\". These 45 people, the parents of Kevin Carter also, helped Marinovich and Silva to write the book \\"straight\\". Judith Matloff, also listed under impimpi, wrote in an article: \\"But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record history\\". Other witnesses or impimpi for the book from that era include: James Nachtwey, Peter Magubane, Brian Mkhize, Gilles Peress, Vivian Silva, and more. The book was first published in January 2000 by William Heinemann, London, UK and then by Basic Books, New York. It was translated into Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and 2015 into German. It is published in 19 Editions.  Book review  Niranjan Karnik wrote the review for H-SAfrica. At the end of his review Niranjan Karnik wrote: \\"I have several concerns about the future of this profession\\". He expressed that conflict journalist need a \\"debriefing\\" after the experience in a conflict or war zone \\"akin to what the International Committee of the Red Cross requires of its fieldworkers\\". The usefulness of the book is for him: \\"Its overall value is not as much in its use as source of history, but in how it openly exposes the way journalists suffer in the course of their work, and the heavy ethical and moral questions they face on an daily basis.\\" Karnik wrote that \\"Students of the media and aspiring journalists will find special value and significance in this book, for its unsparing and often graphic portrayal of events in South Africa.\\" The moral and ethical questions are central themes in the book. Karnik discuss the themes in the example of the noted photograph by Kevin Carter. Karnik explains that the book \\"lacks the academic and critical analysis\\", which he is used to write as an author and which he reads in his profession. But nevertheless he wrote that the book: \\"as a perspective into the dynamics of wartime reporting it is valuable\\".  Film adaptation  In 2010, the Canadian director Steven Silver released a film adaptation of the book as a full-feature film also entitled The Bang Bang Club.

Collegiate club sports can exist at schools that do have teams that are part of the NCAA or NAIA. Many times, club sports are student-run and receive little financial aid from the school. An estimated 2 million student athletes compete in club sports. Typically, most sports offered at universities and offered in youth leagues are also available as a collegiate club team. However, the variety of sports offered is also often related to the size of the school. Collegiate club sports offer college athletes the ability to play at a competitive level, but without the time commitment generally required for a sport governed by the NCAA. The tryout procedure for club sports varies from school to school and from sport to sport. Boston College rugby home match. Responsibility of club sport members Collegiate club sports differ from NCAA sports in the way that they are almost entirely paid for by students through student fees, generally from $50 for certain sports up to $1,500 a year for more expensive sports such as ice hockey. This offers the students a unique opportunity because the club team is operated by students, including in many instances, registered student organizations who must organize and ensure financial support for all club activities. Activities may include picking and paying a coach, nominating and voting on club officers, buying team jerseys and equipment, paying for and deciding on team travel, etc.\\"Rise of College Club Teams Creates a Whole New Level of Success\\", New York Times, Bill Pennington, December 1, 2008. Many captains or club presidents of club sport teams act like managers in comparison to the captains of NCAA teams. However, some universities or colleges will provide some level of support, including access to facilities and club advisors, and in some instances some level of financial support or access to financial support through university supported student funding boards. Governing bodies Collegiate club sports are often, but not always, governed by a governing body such as the National Collegiate Sport Committee. Much of soccer, flag football, basketball, and tennis is governed by the National Intramural-Recreational Sports Association (NIRSA).http://www.nirsa.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Sports Water-skiing and Wakeboarding teams are governed by the National Collegiate Water Ski Association (NCWSA).http://www.ncwsa.com/ Kiteboarding is governed by the Collegiate Kiteboarding Association.http://www.collegekiteboarding.com/ Surfing is governed by the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA).http://www.nssa.org/ Skiing and Snowboarding teams are governed by the United States College Ski Association (USCSA).http://www.uscsa.com/ Golf is governed by the National Collegiate Club Golf Association (NCCGA).http://www.nextgengolf.org/college-golf/nccga Governing bodies usually have the job of organizing tournaments, a league, national or regional championships, providing officials for matches, as well as providing rules, regulations, and bylaws which all teams governed by that body are required to follow. Baseball, football, softball, and basketball are governed by an organization known as CollClubSports, based in Pittsburgh, PA. The NCBA, NCSA, and NCBBA each are very competitive leagues that are quickly growing in numbers. Two partially overlapping sanctioning bodies, the National Club Football Association (NCFA) and Intercollegiate Club Football Federation (ICFF), oversee Club Division College Football at the national level. The National Collegiate Volleyball Federation (NCVF) registers hundreds of club teams each who participate in over 20 collegiate club leagues, thousands of men's and women's intercollegiate club competitions and the annual NCVF National Championship Tournament. The National Intercollegiate Running Club Association also administers a track and field and cross country program. The National Collegiate Roller Hockey Association is the governing body of intercollegiate inline hockey. USA Ultimate is the governing body of Ultimate Frisbee. List of collegiate club sports Note: Because a club sport can exist if there are only two competing schools, any competitive athletic activity could be considered a collegiate club sport. Therefore, many non- conventional sports are played at the club level, for example orienteering.

The company won awards for its innovative, low cost drip irrigation system, eliminating expensive and complex emitters used by traditional drip irrigation systems. The company is based out of Mountain View, California. History Company founder Peter Frykman has a working model of his Driptech system in his California office. In the spring of 2008, three Stanford University graduate students from the schools of business, engineering, and design joined forces in a course called Entrepreneurial Design for Extreme Affordability. The team traveled to Ethiopia to see where they could apply their talents to help, arriving in the middle of the worst drought Ethiopia had experienced in 20 years. The farmers they met had no means to grow crops with the scarce water resources available. The drip irrigation products that were locally available were too expensive for most farmers and seldom worked properly. These farmers needed better, less costly, more effective ways to use their meager water supplies efficiently. The team returned to the Stanford Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (\\"d.school\\") and invented a new manufacturing technology that makes clean, consistent holes in super-low-cost plastic tubing. The resulting product works better and more reliably than the competition at 2-5x less cost. With this success, mechanical engineer Peter Frykman put his plan to get an engineering Ph.D. on hold and incorporated Driptech to manufacture and sell drip irrigation tubing for developing markets across the globe. Operations The company has operations in India and China. In India, it supplies equipment for small farmers in Karnataka, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu through the distribution network of Godrej Agrovet.

The mill, which processed vanadium as well as uranium, was incorporated May 11, 1950. It was constructed on city-owned property next to the Colorado River which was once the Grand Junction sugar beet mill. Climax Uranium Company gutted the former sugar beet mill, removing any remaining equipment and stabilizing weak walls, and began uranium and vanadium milling operations. The mill soon grew to be 12 buildings large and processed 2 million tons of ore, mostly for the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Decommissioning From the early 1950s to 1966, Climax donated approximately 300,000 tons of radioactive uranium tailings to the city of Grand Junction for use as a construction material. The tailings were used in sewer and road construction. In 1972, Congress gave the Atomic Energy Commission authority to cooperate with Grand Junction in a cleanup operation, with the federal government covering 75% of the project's cost. The mill was decommissioned in 1970 under the US Department of Energy's Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action project. The mill site was designated for environmental remediation by the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act in 1978. Restoration The Nuclear Regulatory Commission published a Remedial Action Plan for the site in 1994, and the removal of 4.5 million cubic yards of contaminated materials from the site to a disposal cell was completed that spring.

The Bishop of Manado, Mgr Joseph Suwatan, realized that the crisis hitting Indonesia could be overcome through the establishment of educational institutions. He founded De La Salle Catholic University Manado in cooperation with the Brothers of De La Salle University of Manila, Philippines.

As a first attempt to introduce Catholic-run universities in Manado, the Diocese founded in the 1960s IKIP Catholic Budi Dharma which managed to produce graduates (S1) but was later closed. Steps to re-establish Catholic universities began were again begun by the Diocese in 1997, starting with contacts with the De La Salle Brothers in Manila who have years of experience in managing higher education institutions in the Philippines. = Catholic university = On 7 August 1999, Mgr. J. Suwatan, MSC established the Foundation of Unika De La Salle Manado, with an official letter from Notary R. H. Hardaseputra, SH No. 2 dated 7 August 1999, followed by the Decision Letter of Minister of Education Nr. 123/D/O/2000 (7 August). Father Agus Mangundap, MA was appointed chairman of the foundation. He and other trustee agencies managed the documents and files to be submitted to the Office of Ministry of Education and Culture in Jakarta. In addition, they also coordinated with the provincial of De La Salle Brothers to establish the university, until a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed with the provincial of De La Salle Brothers Philippines. Based on the MOU, the Foundation of De La Salle Manado was established by Bishop of Manado Mgr. Josef Suwatan, MSC and Provincial of La Salle Brothers Philippines Brother Armin Luistro, FSC.Profile of Bro. Armin Luistro, Philippine Information Agency (PIA), Department of Education. After a permit from the Indonesian Government and a lot of improvements, the number of prospective college students of Unika De La Salle Manado drastically increased, a trend that has been continuing until now. In 2009, Father Revi R. H. M. Tanod, SS, SE, MA was appointed Rector for the term of 2009-2013 after passing the selection mechanism.Lassalian Network News, Asia-Pacific Region. = De La Salle Brothers = The university is named after Saint John Baptist De La Salle, who was the founder of the religious congregation of the Lasallian Brothers formally known as the Brothers of the Christian School (Fratres Scholarum Christianarum, abbreviated FSC). This religious congregation, founded in Rheims, France in 1680 is exclusively dedicated to education. = Recent years= Comprehensive and sustainable reformation inside the university have resulted in an increase of confidence from stakeholders, as well as an increasing number of prospective students and the good reputation of its first alumni on the job market. Following the rapid growth of the university, the facilities were moved during the school year 2002-2003 from the original Kanaka campus to a new and much larger campus in Kombos, about 3 km from the center of Manado. Kombos's 15-hectare campus stands around a four-level building (91 x 18 meters) composed of classrooms and administration facilities. The increasing number and diversity of origin of the university's students reflect the rapid development of Unika De La Salle-Manado. In 2007, from 1,077 active students of Unika De La Salle Manado, approximately 20% came from outside the region such as Pontianak, Balikpapan, Samarinda, Jogjakarta, Jakarta, Papua,In August 2010, DLSU-Manado admitted the first group of 17 students from Timika, Papua through the program LPMAK and as part of a partnership with Freeport Ambon and Ternate. In 2009, only a decade after its foundation, the number of students in the university reached 1,183 distributed among the five faculties (Engineering, Nursing, Agriculture, Economics, and Law). This year saw the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MIPA) merging with the Faculty of Engineering. Likewise, human resources along with infrastructure and facilities constantly improved both qualitatively and quantitatively. Each year, about 150-200 students graduate from the university.Graduation Day, 2007 .  Academics  = Faculties = The structure of Unika De La Salle is organized in five faculties as follows: * Engineering Faculty (Electrical, Informatics, Industrial, and Civil) * Economics (Management and Accounting) * Nursing * Law * Agribusiness * Hospitality and Tourism * Education = Supporting units = The university includes the following support units/services: * the English Department * the IT Center * Research and Community Service * Cooperation and Development * the Natural Science Laboratory * the Library * the Language Lab  Motto  The motto of Unika De La Salle Manado is 'Religio, Mores, Cultura' (Religion, Morals, Culture), reflecting the university's vocation to educate young people to believe in and rely on God, endorse and promote moral values, while respecting, exploring and promoting the world's present and past culture.  International and national cooperation  While continuously improving the trainingAn account of early 2011's Applied Approach training for Unika De La Salle's lecturers. and recruitment of its Indonesian lecturers, Unika De La Salle Manado also develops links with national and international institutions, both academic and non-academic. Cooperation with the Lasallian Schools Supervision Services Association, Inc. (LASSSAI) was formalized with the signing of a memorandum of agreement with the diocese in 2009. Intense and long-term cooperation has been developed between Unika De La Salle-Manado with the Asia Pacific Regional Conference (PARC) of the Lasallian Brothers, based in Singapore. The latter, through an agreement with the international cooperation NGO Fidesco (Paris, France) regularly sends dedicated lecturers.FIDESCO's website page about two former lecturers at DLSU-Manado. At the national level, Unika De La Salle Manado is an active member of the Association of Indonesian Catholic University (APTIK) and the Association of Private Higher Education (APTISI) of North Sulawesi province. Unika De La Salle Manado established cooperation agreements with the Institut Teknologi Bandung, Manado State University, University of Sam Ratulangi, and the University of Merdeka Malang (Unmer). In addition, cooperation agreements for the benefit of professional education has been established with several private hospitals in the national and local levels.  Campus  At its beginning, Unika De La Salle-Manado occupied a small campus in the center of Manado, Kanaka. It lasted until September 2002. In October 2002, Unika De La Salle-Manado moved to the new campus occupying an area of on the highland of Kombos. It is about northeast of the old campus.

A functional morpheme (as opposed to a content morpheme) is a morpheme which simply modifies the meaning of a word, rather than supplying the root meaning. Functional morpheme are generally considered a closed class, which means that new functional morphemes cannot normally be created. Functional morphemes can be bound, such as verbal inflectional morphology (e.g., progressive -ing, past tense -ed), or nominal inflectional morphology (e.g., plural -s), or free, such as conjunctions (e.g., and, or), prepositions (e.g., of, by, for, on), articles (e.g., a, the), and pronouns (e.g., she, him, it, you, mine). In English, functional morphemes typically consist of consonants that receive low stress such as /s,z,w,√∞/. These phonemes are seen in conjunction with short vowels, usually schwa /…ô/. Gerken (1994) points out that functional morphemes are indicators of phrases. So, if the word the appears, a noun phrase would be expected to follow. The same occurs with verb phrases and adjective phrases and their corresponding word endings. Functional morphemes tend to occur at the beginning or end of each phrase in a sentence. The previous example of beginning a noun phrase with the indicates a functional morpheme, as does ending a verb phrase with -ed.  Early Language acquisition  Children begin to use functional morphemes in their speech as early as two years old. Functional morphemes encode grammatical meaning within words, but children don't outwardly show their understanding of this. Recently, linguistics have begun to discover that children to recognize functional morphemes, when previously it was thought otherwise. LouAnn Gerken at the University of Arizona has done extensive research on language development in children. She argues that even though children may not actually produce functional morphemes in speech, they do appear to understand their use within sentences. = In English = In order to determine if a child does indeed recognize functional morphemes, Gerken conducted an experiment. This experiment was conducted in English and focused on words that were not said, rather than words that were said. She came up with sentences in which weak syllables were used, as well as nonsense (or nonce) words. Variations of the verb pushes was used and then altered to make nonce words like bazes, pusho, and bazo. The second variation used was the noun phrase the dog which was changed to na dep, or some combination of the correct and incorrect words. Through this experiment, Gerken discovered that children tended to not say English function morphemes more than the nonsense words. This is because the actual functional morphemes contained less stress than the nonsense words. Due to the nonsense words containing more stress, children were able to say them more often even though they were not real words in English. One reason why this happens is because functors show an increase in the complexity of sentence structures. So, rather than saying the complex sentences with weakly stressed English words, children tend to say the nonsense sentences more frequently due to their lack of linguistic complexity. = In French = In children who spoke French, it was discovered that they acted similarly to the children that spoke English. An experiment was conducted by Rushen Shi and Melanie Lepage on children who spoke Quebec French. They decided to take the French determiner des, meaning 'the', and compare it with the words mes meaning 'my', and kes (a nonce word). The two verbs used were preuve 'proof' and sangle 'saddle'. The verbs then had functors attached to them and appeared in variation with the three noun phrases. Compared to English functors which can be identified through stress, French functors are identified through syllables. This difference made an important distinction between English and French language learners because Shi found that French speaking children learn functors at an earlier age than English speaking children. In the study conducted it was found that French speaking children were able to identify the functors. This is thought to be because French has a higher frequency of noun phrases which leads children to pay more attention to functors. = In other languages = Research has been done in other languages such as German and Dutch. So far most languages act similar to English, in that children who are acquiring language learn functional morphemes even though it might not be outwardly apparent.  Neural processing of functional morphemes  Lee et.al. conducted a study on adults who had surgery within six months prior to test for their knowledge of functional morphemes and to determine where in the brain these processes occur. The study revolved around the participants' ability to produce the correct form of the verb talk. By doing so, the researchers were able to determine the specific area where the processing of functional morphemes occur. They observed grey and white matter in the brain and found that the processing of function morphemes occurs in the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ). They also discovered that if the adult had received damage to their post-superior temporal gyrus (P-STG), then they would have problems producing functional morphemes in the future. Lee et.al. concluded that functional morphemes are required for producing lexically complex words and sentences, and that damage to the P-STG can result in adults having issues with these processes.  Bootstrapping  The linguistic theory of bootstrapping refers to how infants come to learn language through the process of language acquisition. By learning functional morphemes, children are unconsciously bootstrapping themselves for other linguistic processes. This includes learning words in general, grammar, the meaning of words, and how phrases work. Through several studies examining children's language acquisition, it was found that children do use functional morphemes to help them develop other parts of their speech.

It was launched on 1 November 1996 and was closed down on 31 July 2005. It was also broadcast in Portugal through Cabovis√£o and TVCabo (now ZON Multim√©dia), and in Spain by satellite TV provider V√≠a Digital until 2003 due to administrative reasons with the TV operator. Initially, Locomotion was a channel dedicated to animation for all ages, broadcasting titles from King Features (which was Hearst's animation division), other acquired shows, and adult animation for an evening block. However, the channel did not want to face competition against the already-established Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, so the channel began removing the children's animation in favour for alternative animation, adult series, and anime by 1998, and by 2000, they began airing more alternative and adult-oriented animation from the US, the United Kingdom and Latin America, as well as anime series.http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.6/articles/deneroffloco1.6.html As the network grew, most of their programming consisted of Japanese animation titles from the likes of ADV Films, Bandai Entertainment, & Geneon and others as well as adult shows like South Park, The Critic, Crapston Villas and Duckman. Locomotion was also dedicated to showing works of experimental animation from all over the world throughout the day on-air and online. They aired experimental programming featuring video jockeys, artists who worked with video as a medium. The network, whose corporate offices were based in Miami, Florida (though the network was not available in the United States aside from a few cable systems in southern Florida) was a joint venture between the US- based Hearst Corporation, (50%) and Claxson Interactive Group, Inc. (a subsidiary of the Venezuelan-based Cisneros Group) (50%).http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.6/articles/deneroffloco1.6.html In May 2002, Cisneros Group sold its shares in the network to Canadian-based Corus Entertainment. The channel was purchased by Sony in 2005 and was later rebranded as Animax. Loco One of Locomotion's VJ projects was a computer- rendered character known as Loco, produced by \\"Modern Cartoons\\". The character, which mostly appeared during commercial breaks, made humorous comments, and did nonsensical things entertaining the viewers. The mascot disappeared as the channel changed its image. A final, yet brief reference of Loco when Animax replaced Locomotion, which is the part where the special agents sent to save Locomotion, they received a call from \\"Loco\\" before he gets killed.  Logo history  Locomotion's first logo resembled a red head with a \\"Loco\\" on its face (the \\"O\\"s being in where the eyes are, the \\"L\\" being in where the left ear is, and the \\"C\\" being in where the nose is) and a \\"Motion\\" in its mouth. This was used since the launch of the channel and was phased out in 1999 as the channel began shifting towards alternative and adult animation series, such as South Park, as well as anime series. Locomotion's second logo retained the head from the previous logo, although colored white and inside a gray circle and lacking the details the previous logo had. The \\"Locomotion\\" was shown left of the \\"circle\\" in an Italicized font. This was used from 1999 to May 2002. Locomotion's third logo was the same as the previous logo, but the \\"circle\\" now colored (most of the time red and blue) as opposed to gray and the logo was updated. This logo was used since Claxson's sale of their stake in the channel to Corus Entertainment, all the way until the closure of the channel. A variation of the third logo had the words \\"Animestation\\" below the \\"Locomotion\\" of the logo since the channel ceased to broadcast in Spain and Portugal. It was used from 2004 until the closure of the channel in 2005. TV blocks The programming of this channel was divided in thematic blocks which are: * 80's TV: A space dedicated to all cartoons that were a hit in the decade. * Anime Loving: As its name says, a space dedicated to anime lovers. * Japanimotion/JapanOK!: A space dedicated to better Japanese animation, hidden gems of anime, Anime films and anime series. * Animafilms: A space dedicated to hidden International animation gems. * Fracto: A space dedicated to experimental animation and techno music. * Cortos Locomotion: Short films between each space of TV programs. * Love Vision: Short animations and experimental music broadcast between TV programs. * Replay: The best of the week. * Kapsula: Space dedicated to the best directors of experimental animation and where the people can send their works. Acquisition, shutdown and aftermath Locomotion was bought by Sony Pictures Entertainment Latin America in January 2005 from Hearst Corporation and Corus Entertainment.\\"Silex-IT Client Case Studies\\" Animax Channel Client Profile: Sony Corporation silex-it.com Retrieved on May 18, 2012 After the acquisition of the network and until its shutdown, the non-anime shows where dropped from their programming in order to focus more on an all anime line-up. The network officially ceased to exist at 11:00 a.m. on July 31 of the same year (however, the broadcast of Locomotion stopped on the night of July 30 and was replaced by a countdown clock). From then on, the network had been transformed into the Latin American branch of Animax. Of all the programming broadcast previously on Locomotion, only Vandread, Saber Marionette J, Saber Marionette J to X, Soul Hunter, Serial Experiments Lain, The Candidate for Goddess and Earth Girl Arjuna were picked and broadcast by Animax on their early programming. As of February 2006, all those series were off the air. Neon Genesis Evangelion and Super Milk Chan, both which had aired on Locomotion, would also air on Animax, although 3 years after Locomotion's shutdown, and in the case for Evangelion, it got a new spanish dub. The non-anime shows produced by MTV Networks and broadcast on Locomotion (like South Park, Ren and Stimpy and √Üon Flux) were picked and shown on a weekend animation block by MTV Latin America, but in November 2006, this block was replaced with Animatosis (a Sic 'Em Friday-alike block) and all the shows (with the exception of South Park) were cancelled, and South Park continues to air as of present day, and recently now airs on a localized version of its home network. Bob and Margaret is shown (as of January 2006) on the defunct-but-now-relaunched Latin American version of Adult Swim. The Critic broadcast in the Latin American version of HBO Family. Other shows, like Dr. Katz and Duckman hasn't been shown again on Latin America since the Locomotion shutdown.

Smile, Dong-hae) is a 2010 South Korean daily television drama, starring Ji Chang-wook, Do Ji-won, Oh Ji-eun, Park Jung-ah and Lee Jang-woo. It aired on Korean Broadcasting System's premier channel KBS1 from October 4, 2010 to May 13, 2011 on Mondays to Fridays at 20:25 for 159 episodes. Plot =Prologue= Over 40 years ago, the Cho family lost their daughter (Cho Dong-baek) in a severe storm and almost drowned. Although Dong- baek survived, she suffered brain damage, erasing her past memories and left with the mental capacity of a nine year old. Despite the tragic circumstances, she was adopted by an American family and renamed her Anna Laker. Even though she has intellectual limitations, she can function almost normally like an adult. As a young adult, she fell in love with a Korean man, who used the English name James (aka Kim Joon), while he was studying abroad in New York. Due to personal circumstances, James had to leave Anna, but he asked Anna to wait for him and he'll find her. James did return to find Anna, but by then, she relocated and couldn't find her whereabouts; he returned to Korea. A year or two later, James encountered Hong Hye-sook (adopted daughter of the Cho Family), a woman that deeply loved James and didn't want to let him go. She pressured James to stay with her and the two got married and had a son together, Kim Do-jin. Unknown to James, Anna was pregnant and gave birth to their son, Carl Laker (aka Dong-hae). Anna would spend the next 27 years, waiting for James while being a single mother to Carl. Their past, present, and future would all change when the Laker family decided to head to Seoul. =Main Story= Carl/Dong-hae visits Korea with his mother to participate in the short track speed skating competition as a representative on the American team. His trip to Korea is not just for the competition, but also to see his girlfriend, Sae-hwa, whom he dated for 6 years and promised to marry. However, Sae-hwa had a change of heart. Sae-hwa tells Dong-hae that she cannot be with him as long as he is with Anna. Later, he saves Sae-hwa from being struck by a truck in a traffic accident. The accident injured Dong-hae and ended his skating career. Meanwhile, Anna sees Dong-hae's father by chance and doesn't want to leave Korea. Dong-hae decides to stay in Korea and search for his father. He decides to find him and ask him the reason why he left them. In the midst of all of this is Bong-yi, an aspiring chef who wants to be the first female head chef. Bong-yi and her family take Dong-hae and his mother Anna in and treat them as family. However, the Lakers will be challenged in their quest for truth and happiness. Sae-hwa had caught the attention of Do-jin and the two began to date. Although James has been loyal to his wife, his thoughts was always with Anna, causing him to be a distant father to Do-jin. Because of how Do-jin grew up, he doesn't want to date someone who had a relationship before, having an unusual logic that a women with an ex-boyfriend would unfaithfully think about their former partner rather than their current one. Sae-hwa wanted to marry into the Kim Family and lied about being an inexperienced girl that was too busy studying to date anyone. The lie worked at first, but Dong-hae ended up working for the Camellia Hotel, where his half-brother works. Fearing that Dong-hae might mess things up, Sae-hwa always worried that Dong-hae might do something to ruin her plans. Sae-hwa ultimately married Do-jin and the couple was happy for a time, but Sae-hwa's constant fear of her past coming out lead to James learning the truth between Dong- hae's and Sae-hwa's past relationship in New York. Eventually, Do-jin also discovered the truth as well, leading him to distrust Sae-hwa and Dong-hae. Although the two have never rekindled their romance, Do-jin is constantly convinced that Dong-hae is after his wife and Sae-hwa is somehow suspiciously disloyal to him. The real romance was blossoming between Dong-hae and Bong-yi as they secretly dated each other behind their family's backs. Things would only get complicated when Sae-hwa learned the truth of Dong-hae's true identity. Learning of Dong-hae's paternity to James, she did her best to make sure the Lakers didn't get too close to the Kim Family to avoid discovery. However, Anna ended up working at the Camellia hotel as well and James' wife (unknowing of their relationship to James) took care of the Lakers for a time. Through Sae-hwa's own fumble, people in her family started to learn about Dong-hae's true identity and they conspired to help Sae-hwa to mutually protect their interests. When James finally found Anna, he couldn't help but investigate into her life and the Lees. Despite Sae-hwa's meddling and pressuring Anna to not reveal Dong-hae, James finally realized Dong-hae is his lost son. Because of the complications of reuniting as father and son, James kept his identity a secret to Dong-hae, but use his excuse as an executive to spend time with him. Eventually though, Hye-sook and Do-jin would learn about Anna and Dong-hae. With the secret exposed, Dong-hae had difficulty accepting James as his father. Although Anna tried to explain that James never knew about him, Dong-hae had trouble welcoming a father that was never there for them. Feeling guilty and responsible for his actions, James wanted to divorce Hye-sook, leaving his family, and take care of his lost family. Unfortunately, it was met with great resistance. Do-jin refused to admit Dong-hae as his brother and made every effort to make his life difficult. Hye-sook would blackmail James, warning him that if he leaves the family, she'll use everything in her power to make the Lakers suffer for it. The Lees at the time were financially tied to the Camellia Hotel in their kimchi business, Hye-sook intends to hurt anyone that ever cared for the Lakers in retaliation, forcing James to stay put. When Anna realized that Hye-sook's husband was her beloved James, she was devastated and realized she can't destroy a family. Hye-sook would confront Anna, asking her to leave their family alone and offered them money and plane tickets to return to America so the Kim Family would be at peace. However, Dong-hae didn't want to submit to their pressure. While James offered to run away to America with the Lakers, but the Lakers themselves decided to leave the city to avoid hurting the Lees and bow to the demands of the Kims. However, Bong-yi was devastated that Dong-hae left without saying a word. He left a letter, explaining his reasons for leaving, but he promised this isn't a goodbye; he intends to return and wants her to wait for him. Several weeks have passed and the Lakers initially found peace in a new neighborhood. Hye-sook and Do-jin kept a vigilant eye for the Lakers if they ever returned. Lee Pil-jae (a cop and Bong-yi's uncle) was in love with Anna and tried to search for them. Eventually, through his police connections, he did find Anna. Dong-hae was a budding celebrity chef and secretly worked at a friend's restaurant to help make ends meet. During this whole time, both Do- jin and Hye-sook grew cold and weary of Sae-hwa; they both wanted her out of their lives and insisted on a divorce. Not willing to give up on Do-jin, she summoned the Chos back into the hotel, causing blackmail and pressure to prevent herself from getting divorced. Mal-sun, Anna's mother, previously tasked Hye-sook to search for her missing daughter. However, she lied and secretly buried the investigation. Because she was loved by the Chos and devoted 30 years of her life into the Camellia Hotel, she always felt she rightfully deserve ownership of the hotel. If Anna would to come back, Mr. Cho would never transfer his majority shares to Hye-sook and she'll only be an executive for the rest of her life. Mr. Cho returned to review the status of his hotel while Mrs. Cho used that time to resume searching for their missing daughter. Mr. Cho discovered the Kim Family was fragmented due to James' past relationship with Anna and tried to pressure him to stay with Hye-sook. Sae- hwa managed to figure out that Anna and Dong-hae are related to the Chos and did everything in her power to use this information as a bargaining chip to keep her within the Kim Family. Unfortunately, the secret was exposed and she lost all bargaining power. Sae-hwa eventually grew tired of trying to win back Do-jin and she granted him the signed divorce papers. However, Sae-hwa would later found out she's pregnant with Do-jin's child. Because James felt responsible for what happened to his daughter-in-law, he made the effort to look after her and she repaid his kindness by occasionally tipping him off about the devious machinations of his wife and son. During Dong-hae's and Bong-yi's wedding, Do-jin called for an emergency stockholders' meeting to talk about the future management of the hotel. Dong-yi secretly discovered a calculation mistake in the hotel's finances and tipped off the authorities of tax fraud. This discovery was costly and Mr. Cho couldn't save the hotel unless he liquidated his shares into the market. Amassing his own support group, Do-jin amassed enough stocks to make Hye-sook the new majority shareholder of Camellia Hotel. News of this was a major shock to Mr. Cho and he fell into a coma. Dong-hae's wedding was ruined with the sudden collapse of his grandfather. With Hye-sook as the majority holder, she can now secure her power as the chairman of the hotel. However, the Lees, Chos, and Lakers wouldn't take this defeat so easily. During the power struggle, the Camellia invested in a major hotel project in Hainan-China, but the funds went missing. Do-jin moved money out of the project and caused instability within the hotel's investments. Dong-hae began investigating into the matter and the key to solving it was Do-jin's lawyer. After the takeover, the lawyer vanished and Dong-hae tasked Pil-jae to help track him down. In between, Do-jin lost his support from his own mother. Hye-sook has been feeling very guilty about what she put her adopted father through. To atone for her sins, she decided to support Dong-hae as CEO of Camellia instead of Do-jin. Beyond Do-jin's imagination, Hye-sook gave away her shares to Dong-hae, restoring him as the majority shareholder of Camellia. Do-jin's lawyer provided all the necessary evidence to prove Do-jin guilty for embezzlement. With evidence against him in the Hainan project and loss of his shares due to his own mother, Do-jin ran off in disgrace. However, it would be James uniting the family. James had an accident a while back and he's suffering from a brain aneurysm, slowly killing him. With all that has happened, he wanted to finalize things and see his family in case he wouldn't make it. Although Dong-hae pleaded with his father to take emergency surgery, James was waiting on Do-jin. Dong-hae tracked down and the two confronted each other in a fight and later sat down for an honest chat about their father and Sae-hwa's pregnancy. After learning that their father is dying and Sae-hwa with child, Do-jin finally let go of his grudge against Dong-hae, reconciled with Sae-hwa, and saw his James before he operated. The final matter was James' decision between Anna and Hye-sook. Even though Hye-sook realized she pressured James into marriage and he his thoughts was always about Anna, James realized he needed Hye-sook more than Anna. In doing so, James restored his marriage to Hye-sook. With James out of the competition, Pil-jae is able to be with Anna without further emotional confusion. Everyone finally made peace with each other. =Epilogue= A year has passed now and everyone is doing well. Dong-hae has become an accomplished manager in Camellia and Bong-yi as become an accomplished chef. Do-jin paid for his crimes and returned to society, where he finally get to reunited with Sae-hwa and meet his son. Joo-yeon (Sae-hwa's little sister) became a successful model while her husband finally passed the bar and became a judge. With everything right in the world, Dong-hae re-proposed Bong-yi (after the health scare with his grandfather) and the two successfully carried out their marriage without a hitch this time.

He has been CNN's Kabul Correspondent, an Asia and foreign affairs correspondent for the UK's Channel 4 News, and Moscow correspondent for The Guardian newspaper. Education Paton Walsh was born in Guildford, Surrey. and educated at Epsom College, a boarding independent school in the town of Epsom, also in Surrey, followed by University College London. Professional background =Television career= Paton Walsh began working for CNN in March 2011 in Pakistan. He covered the death of Osama bin Laden as their first reporter in country to the story, entering the fugitive's former compound and breaking the news that cellphone signals had led the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the al-Qaeda leader. Paton Walsh covered American President Barack Obama's speech about the withdrawal of America's troops from Afghanistan, detailing a Taliban resurgence in Nuristan Province, a booming opium culture in Badakhshan Province, together with insurgent violence and a resurgent al-Qaeda in Kunar. He also reported from Benghazi on Libya's declaration of liberty after Gaddafi was deposed. In September he became CNN's full-time correspondent in Kabul. He moved to Beirut in August 2012, from where Paton Walsh began covering the civil war in Syria. He reported from inside Aleppo on the fate of a 4-year-old girl hit by a sniper, the aftermath of an airstrike on a family home, Aleppo airstrikes, and the protracted battle for 100 yards of a street in the Old City. The reports helped win CNN a Peabody, two Edward R Murrow Awards, and a News and Documentary Emmy Award for Individual Achievement in a Craft ‚Äì Writing. Paton Walsh reported from Dagestan on the family of the alleged Boston Bombers, and from Turkey during weeks of unrest over the planned demolition of Gezi Park. He joined Channel Four News at ITN as a foreign affairs correspondent from the Guardian newspaper in September 2006. He covered the Iraq surge both from Washington and Baghdad, and reported from Mosul and Basra. He interviewed Russian murder suspect Andrey Lugovoy, on the day the Russian businessman was charged by British police with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko; worked in Chechnya and Ingushetia; covered child soldiers in the Central African Republic; and climate change in Tajikistan. While based in London, Paton Walsh uncovered a series of exclusives for the programme, including the British use of incendiary bombs in Afghanistan; a covert British programme to train the special forces of regimes considered to have questionable human rights records; and Sebastian Coe's controversial description of the Chinese policemen who guided the Olympic torch through London as \\"thugs\\".\\"Chinese torch guards are 'thugs' says British Olympic chief\\", telegraph.co.uk, 8 April 2008. Paton Walsh was the programme's undercover correspondent in Zimbabwe, during the 2008 elections. He was one of a handful of western reporters inside the country during the violent crackdown on the MDC. He also reported the war between Georgia and Russia in July 2008 from both sides of the front line.PBS, carried Channel Four News report from Gori, Georgia, pbs.org, 13 August 2008. In September 2008, Paton Walsh moved to Bangkok, to become the programme's Asia correspondent. During the Mumbai hotel sieges that November, he got the first interview with the Australian barman held in the Taj Hotel. Channel Four News ran the first interview in seven years in March 2009 with alleged Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. The product of six months of negotiations by Paton Walsh, the interview took place in his remand centre and at the courthouse, where he was facing extradition to the United States. Bout professed his innocence, but also admitted his planes could have run weapons without his knowledge; that he ran guns for the Afghan government in the 1990s; and said he was close personal friends with Jean Pierre Bemba, an alleged warlord on trial in the Hague for crimes against humanity. \\"'Merchant of Death' denies arming terror\\", guardian.co.uk, 15 March 2009. Along with his colleagues in a Channel Four News team in Sri Lanka during April 2009, Paton Walsh was deported for their reporting on allegations from the United Nations about sexual abuse in camps of those internally displaced there. The other members of the team, including producers Nevine Mabro and Bessie Du, along with cameraman Matt Jasper, had been one of a handful to report the end of the 25-year war when the military closed in on a tiny strip of land, filled with civilians, in the country's north east, called the No Fire Zone. After three weeks of coverage, the team ran footage secretly filmed inside the camps, into which Tamil civilians fleeing the fighting had been held. The report so enraged the country's defence minister, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, that he personally rang Paton Walsh to inform him he and his team would be deported. They were held by police and then taken to the airport, causing the allegations in his report to gain international attention. While serving as an Asia correspondent, Paton Walsh worked extensively in Afghanistan, including the presidential election crisis of 2009. Embedded across the country in Or≈´zgƒÅn, Helmand, Paktika, Khost, Nurestan, Kunar, and Kandahar, he gained rare access to COP Keating in Nurestan, a tiny American outpost isolated near the Pakistani border, which was overrun by insurgents in October 2009. Paton Walsh interviewed General Stanley McChrystal, the NATO commander removed for injudicious comments about his civilian superiors. Perhaps presciently, McCrystal told Walsh, when referring to President Hamid Karzai's recent outbursts, \\"war is high stress stuff\\" that often causes people to say rash things.General Stanley McChrystal, interview with Channel Four News, channel4.com; accessed 12 February 2015.

It was the first of several major dams built on the Grijalva River to generate hydroelectric energy and has the second largest reservoir in Mexico, after the Belisario Dominguez Dam. Construction of the dam occurred in the 1960s and flooded not only the riverbed but also hectares of rainforest and farmland, various towns and villages and archeological sites. These include the former town of Quechula, whose 16th century Dominican church will appear when water is at low levels, and the archeological site of San Isidro which contains one of only two known double Mesoamerican ball courts. Commissioning of the dam's 1,080 MW power station began in 1969 and ended in 1977. The reservoir and later construction of a federal highway has spurred ecotourism in the area. Reservoir and its surroundings Malpaso is one of several on the Grijalva River in Chiapas, along with the Chicoas√©n, Pe√±itas, and Belisario Dominguez (La Angostura) . The Nezahualcoyotl is the second largest reservoir in Mexico after the Belisario Dominguez, covering an area of 995,000 hectares and with a maximum storage capacity of 9,750 million meters cubed. The dam mostly exists to power one of the largest hydroelectric complexes in Mexico. It is managed by the Comit√© T√©cnico de Operaci√≥n de Obras Hidr√°ulicas which is made up of the Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad, Conagua and the Engineering Institute of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM) among others. There is an overlook set up to get a panoramic view of the reservoir and surroundings. The dam and reservoir are located in the mountainous Centro region of the state, mostly in the municipalities of Tecpat√°n with some in Ocozocoautla, 139 km northwest of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez . The area has a hot and humid climate with most rain occurring between June and November, which are also the hottest months as well. The average annual temperature is 25C. The area ecology is mostly tall growth rainforest and most belongs to the El Ocote Biosphere Reserve. The area is considered to be Zoque territory but there are communities of Tzotzils as well. Construction Construction of the dam began in 1959 with most completed by 1964 and final containment of the reservoir completed in 1966. It was built by C√≠a Raudales, a consortium of seven companies. Construction was undertaken in four main phases, with the river diverted through tunnels on both sides of its normal course. The first stage built five tunnels as well as an access bridge on one side. In the second stage, the river was diverted into these tunnels by blocking its normal course to allow construction of the dam. In the third phase, the dam structure was built, finished in 1964 and the closing the tunnels was begun. In the last stage the final tunnels were closed and the reservoir completely sealed by the dam. The resulting reservoir not only covered the rapids of this area of the Grijalva River, but also fresh water and thermal springs, rainforest, animal habitat, farmland, archeological sites and various towns and villages, with the most significant being Quechula. Quechula was a Zoque dominion when the Spanish arrived in 1524. The Dominicans built a church here, the Temple of Santiago, starting in 1564, which was submerged with the rest of the town after construction of the dam. However, each year during the dry season, at least part of this structure reappears when water levels are low. Most of the building‚Äôs walls have collapsed but the wall with the bell gable remains. This first time this occurred, local residents decided to hold mass in the old town. The reappearance of the church still brings visitors to the area. The creation of the dam forced the relocation of hundreds of families in the area with most moved to a community called Nuevo Quechula. Before the building of the dam, the area was surveyed by the Proyecto de Salvamento Arqueologico (Archeological Salvage Project) . One of the major finds from this period is the site of San Isidro with its Mesoamerican ball court in 1965. The San Isidro site is located at the former conjunction of the Grijalva and La Venta Rivers. Its ball court is significant because it is double, with a nearly square space of eighty by sixty meters, bordered by the traditional sloped walls. In the center of the space is a division making two sub-courts. Today this site is under the waters of the reservoir. Flood control issues The area is hot and humid with large quantities of rainfall which mostly comes in from the Gulf of Mexico through the state of Tabasco. Precipitation in the area is also strongly affected by the weather phenomena of El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a which can significantly raise or lower reservoir levels and the amount of water which flows out of them through the dams. Malpaso is the closest large dam to the flat floodplains of Tabasco, with only the smaller Pe√±itas closer. These two dams serve as a means to control flooding of the river as it heads into Tabasco state, but when reservoirs are dangerously full, it becomes necessary to release large quantities of water. This most often occurs in late summer and fall, when rains are heaviest. This water heads to the flat slow draining floodplains of Tabasco, including its capital of Villahermosa and has cause serious flooding problems. In 1970, the silting basin was severely damaged during a flood 20% less than the design capacity. Pressure fluctuations caused the stone slabs to detach from their anchor. The last major floodings related to the Malpaso dam occurred in 2007 and 2008. Unusually heavy rain not only filled the dam to over capacity, flooding about 400 towns around the area in 2007. In 2008, Twenty two communities in the dam area were flooded and when the water finally flowed freely again, major flooding occurred in Tabasco, especially in Nacajuca . In 2008, Comisi√≥n Federal de Electricidad, the dam's owner, shut down operations at the dam to complete the second stage on a canal project designed to alleviate storage in the dam's reservoir. The canal's construction occurred in three stages and it was dug through a mud slide in between the dam and the Pe√±itas Dam downstream. At the end of the third stage, the canal will be able to pass . Ecotourism Restaurants next to the reservoir at the Chiapas bridge The creation of the dam and later infrastructure projects has allowed for the development of an ecotourism industry in the area. Most of the reservoir is within the El Ocote Biosphere Reserve, an area of tall growth rainforest. This is one of the most important in southern Mexico due to the size and biological diversity. The federal government has invested in the development of ecotourism in the area such as Jun Jnopbentik, which is administered by eight local ejido organizations. Another attraction connected to the reservoir‚Äôs river system is the La Venta Canyon, which is part of the La Venta River that feeds the reservoir and also part of the El Ocote Reserve. Next to the Chiapas Bridge, part of a major federal highway that was built in the area since the dam was constructed, there is an ecotourism center which offers boat tours, hiking, horseback riding and camping, along with a number of restaurants for passers- by featuring fish from the area. Chiapas Bridge The Chiapas Bridge crosses over the Malpaso Dam reservoir and its part of a federal highway that connects southern Veracruz to Tuxtla Gutierrez. The bridge and highway make the dam area more accessible to tourism. The decision to build the bridge was made in 2002 and the project lasted fourteen months with inauguration occurring in December 2003. The bridge stretches 1,208 meters over a section of the reservoir. The bridge is ten meters wide, with eight supports, seven pillars or \\"jackets\\" and one strip of concrete fastened onto solid land.

Its San Antonio location is at the Wonderland of the Americas mall, where it houses a cosmetology school and a nursing school with vocational and RN programs. The Career Point College LVN program was ranked 49th out of 95 Texas programs by PracticalNursing.com.  History  The founding institution, Dickinson Business School, was established in 1921 by Harold R. Frazell to train typists in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1953, a secretarial program was added, a new shorthand system was developed, and by the late 1950s this system was widely accepted in the Kansas City area and became known as ‚ÄúDickinson Shorthand.‚Äù In the early 1970s, a Missouri corporation consisting of two local educators purchased Dickinson Business School and modified the schools educational programs to emphasize individualized, self-paced instruction, and in late December 1981, Lawrence D. Earle purchased an interest in the institution, broadening the financial base of the school. By August 1982, Dickinson Business School became accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS), and the San Antonio campus was approved by the Texas Education Agency on December 13, 1983. The first classes began on January 3, 1984, and in 1988, the San Antonio campus was granted ‚Äúmain campus status‚Äù by ACICS. Approximately six years later, on December 20, 1989, Earle acquired all outstanding stock of the school from his partner, changed the institution's name to Career Point Business School, and focused solely on the main campus in San Antonio, and a branch campus in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Over the next six years, Career Point Business School increased the sizes of both campuses, as it offered programs in the Medical, Business, Legal and Technology fields. The school later transitioned to competency-based training and assessment, and continued to modify its program offerings, which eventually led the Board of Directors to change the school's name to Career Point Institute on March 27, 2001. Soon thereafter, with the introduction of various Associate degree programs, the name changed one final time to Career Point College at the end of 2007. The college implemented a full-time vocational nursing program in 2009. In 2011, Career Point College expanded its campus on Balcones Heights mall. In 2015, the college campus at the Wonderland of the Americas expanded to make room for its new registered nursing program. On October 16, 2016, President and CEO Larry Earle, announced the immediate closure of Career Point College. Students were notified via email.  Former programs  After 2011, Career Point College has made significant additions to the program offerings at both campuses. The Texas Board of Nursing approved Career Point College to offer vocational and registered nursing programs at the School of Nursing and Medical Technology on the San Antonio campus, and both the Texas and Oklahoma State Boards of Cosmetology have approved cosmetology programs to be taught at the Schools of Cosmetology on both campuses. The college offers education in a total of 28 distinct concentrations, including Associate of Applied Science degrees in Criminal Justice, Cyber Security, and Network Support Specialist, and training in Early Childhood Education, Paralegal, Medical Billing and Coding, Pharmacy Technician, and User Support Specialist.

It is known from an incomplete skull and postcranial skeleton recovered from the Kaiparowits Formation. It was specifically named T. curriei in honor of Philip J. Currie. Discovery and naming Postcranial elements Fossils of Teratophoneus were first found in the Kaiparowits Formation of southern Utah. Later, fossils from the same formation were discovered and identified as the genus. Argon-argon radiometric dating indicates that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.1 and 74.0 million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. This date means that Teratophoneus lived in the middle of the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous. Three different fossils of Teratophoneus have been found. Originally, Teratophoneus was described based on the holotype BYU 8120. More recently, the specimens UMNH VP 16690 and UMNP VP 16691 have been assigned to it. Teratophoneus was named by Thomas D. Carr, Thomas E. Williamson, Brooks B. Britt and Ken Stadtman in 2011. The type and only species was named T. curriei. The generic name is derived from the Greek teras, \\"monster\\", and phoneus, \\"murderer.\\" The specific name honors Philip J. Currie. In 2017, a new specimen of Teratophoneus was discovered in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and airlifted to the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City. Description Restored skull and fossils The holotype of Teratophoneus consists of a fragmentary skull and parts of the postcranial skeleton. The fossils were originally assigned to four different individuals, but are probably only of a single subadult animal. The specimen of Teratophoneus was not fully grown: according to an estimate by Carr et al. was about in length and in weight. In 2016, Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi estimated it to be in length and in weight. Gregory S. Paul gave a higher estimation of and . Compared to the skull of an Albertosaurus, Teratophoneus is roughly twenty-three percent shorter in proportion between the lacrimal bone of the and the tip of the snout. The skull of Teratophoneus is also comparably deeper. It is unclear if there was a specific reason for these differences, but the extra depth may have allowed for stronger jaw muscles, increasing the bite force of Teratophoneus. Classification Loewen et al. (2013) conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the family Tyrannosauridae, and confirmed the assignment of Teratophoneus to the tyrannosaurid sub-family Tyrannosaurinae. They concluded that Teratophoneus was closely related to both Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, but placed in a more basal position within the family, though more derived than Daspletosaurus. Skeletal diagram showing the known material Life restoration Below is the cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Loewen et al. in 2013. In 2020 when describing Thanatotheristes, Voris et al., 2020 found Teratophoneus to be in a subclade alongside Dynamoterror and Lythronax. The clade remains unnamed.Voris, Jared T.; Therrien, Francois; Zelenitzky, Darla K.; Brown, Caleb M.

Paleoecology =Habitat= Teratophoneus curriei attacking a Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus The holotype of Teratophoneus were recovered at the Kaiparowits Formation, in southern Utah. Argon-argon radiometric dating indicates that the fossils were buried during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, the site within the Kaiparowits Formation was located on Laramidia near its eastern shore on the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, the other being Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and an abundance of wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an array of different and diverse groups of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world. =Paleofauna= Teratophoneus curriei shared its paleoenvironment with theropods such as dromaeosaurids, the troodontid Talos sampsoni, ornithomimids like Ornithomimus velox, armored ankylosaurids, the duckbilled hadrosaurs Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus and Gryposaurus monumentensis, the ceratopsians Utahceratops gettyi, Nasutoceratops titusi and Kosmoceratops richardsoni and the oviraptorosaurian Hagryphus giganteus. Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, marsupials, and insectivorans.

Life The first official mention of his name is as captain of the Adventure in 1648, when Vice-Admiral William Batten carried part of the fleet over to Holland to join Charles Stuart, Prince of Wales. Ball was one of those who stayed with Sir George Ayscue, and who afterwards, on 25 September 1648, signed the refusal to desert. During 1649 he was employed in the English Channel, cruising off the Lizard or Land's End for the safeguard of merchant ships against pirates and sea-rovers, and on 21 December was ordered specially to attend to Prince Rupert's movements. In November 1650, still in the Adventure, he was selected to accompany Captain Sir William Penn to the Mediterranean, and was on that voyage for nearly sixteen months, arriving in the Downs on 1 April 1652. During the following summer he was engaged in fitting out the Antelope, a new ship only just launched, and in September was sent to Copenhagen in command of a squadron of eighteen ships. The King of Denmark, on some misunderstanding about the Sound dues, had laid an embargo on about twenty English merchant ships that were in Danish harbours, and it was hoped that the appearance of a respectable force would remove the difficulty. They sailed from Yarmouth on 9 September, and on the 20th anchored a few miles below Elsinore; there they remained, treating with the King of Denmark, but forbidden to use force, as the King of Denmark was probably aware. They were still hoping that the ships might be released, when, on 30 September, they were caught in the open roadstead in a violent storm; the cables parted, the Antelope was hurled on shore, the other ships, more or less damaged, were swept out to sea. It was not till 2 October that they could get back and take up the survivors from the wreck; after which they did not stay for further negotiations, but set sail for England, and arrived in Bridlington Bay on the 14th. They went on to Harwich and the Thames, to refit. After the severe check which Robert Blake received at the Battle of Dungeness, on 30 November, Ball was appointed to the 50-gun Lion, in the room of Captain Saltonstall, whose conduct in the battle had been called into question. He was occupied during the next two months in refitting the Lion, and then joined the fleet off Queenborough at the beginning of February 1653, when Blake promoted him to the command of his own ship, the Triumph, (a position somewhat analogous to what was later known as captain of the fleet, which confers the temporary rank of rear-admiral). The fleet, having sailed to the westward, encountered the Dutch off Portland on 18 February 1653. The fight, the Battle of Portland, lasted throughout the day, and during the whole time the enemy's chief efforts were directed against the Triumph, which suffered heavily in hull, in rigging, and in men; her captain, Andrew Ball, being one of the killed. In acknowledgement of Ball's services, the state assigned a gratuity of ¬£1,000 to his widow. The Andrew Ball who commanded the Orange Tree in the Mediterranean, under Sir Thomas Allin, in 1668, and was then accidentally drowned, may have been a son.

It was constructed in 1846 to replace the previous medieval church in the village of Llangaffo. The new building includes a number of monuments from the old church, and has a spire which is a prominent local landmark. The churchyard has part of a stone cross dating from the 9th or 10th century, and some gravestones from the 9th to 11th centuries. It is dedicated to St Caffo, a 6th-century martyr who was killed in the vicinity. The church is still in use as part of the Church in Wales, one of four churches in a combined parish. It is a Grade II listed building, a designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"a mid 19th-century rural church, consistently articulated and detailed in an Early English style\\". History and location The date of first construction of a church in Llangaffo (a village in Anglesey about south of the county town of Llangefni) is uncertain. The village takes its name from the church: the Welsh word ' originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"-gaffo\\" is a modified form of the saint's name. St Caffo, a 6th-century Christian, was a companion of St Cybi and was martyred by shepherds in the vicinity of what is now Llangaffo, perhaps in revenge for his brother Gildas insulting Maelgwn Gwynedd, the local ruler. It is thought that there may have at one point been a monastery in this location, known as \\"Merthyr Caffo\\": merthyr is the Welsh word for \\"martyr\\", and in place names means a building erected near a saint's grave. The present building, which is in the north-eastern part of the village on the south-eastern side of the B4419 road, was erected in 1846 alongside the churchyard to a design by the Sheffield-based architects Weightman and Hadfield. It replaced an older church, which had stood on an adjoining outcrop of rock until it was demolished. It was described by the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones (writing in 1846, as the new church was being constructed) as a \\"very small and unimportant edifice\\"; he also noted that it was the only medieval building remaining in the parish. The 19th-century church is still in use and belongs to the Church in Wales. It is one of four churches in the combined benefice of Llanfihangel Ysgeifiog (St Michael's Church, Gaerwen) with Llangristiolus (St Cristiolus's Church) with Llanffinan (St Ffinan's Church) with Llangaffo. It is within the deanery of Malltraeth, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2012, the vicar of the four churches is Emlyn Williams, assisted by a curate (E. R. Roberts). Williams was appointed in 2007; before that, the position had been vacant for 20 years despite many attempts by the Church in Wales to fill it. Services in Welsh are held every Sunday, either Holy Communion or Morning Prayer; there are no midweek services. Edward Wynn (1618‚Äì1669) was rector here from 1658; he later became Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral, and is buried at the church. James Williams (1790‚Äì1872) was the son of John Williams, rector of St Caffo's. He succeeded his father when he resigned in 1821, and later became Chancellor of Bangor Cathedral. Architecture and fittings The base of the 9th- or 10th-century cross in the churchyard St Caffo's is built of rubble masonry dressed with limestone, in an early English style (a style of architecture used between about 1180 and 1275, typically using narrow pointed windows and arches). The roof is made of slate. The tower, at the west end, has buttresses at the corners and is topped with a broach spire, which is a prominent local landmark. Entrance is through an arched doorway in the north side of the tower. The chancel, at the east end of the church, is smaller than the nave in both height and width; there is a transept on the north side of the chancel. The nave has lancet windows, and there is a further lancet window on the south side of the chancel. The church's east window is set in a pointed arch and has three lights (sections of window separated by mullions). Inside the church, the sanctuary at the east end is raised above the chancel by one step; the floor of the sanctuary and the reredos behind the altar are made from encaustic tiles. Fittings include a circular decorated 12th-century font and a 17th-century pulpit with carved decorative panels. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded that the church owned a silver cup and a paten dated 1736. The transept has a number of memorials dating from the 17th century (including one to Edward Wynn), and a stone from the early 7th century inscribed with \`..VI / RNIN / FILIUS / CUURIS / CINI / ERE / XIT / HUNC / LAPI / DEM\`. The stone, which is set in the wall, originally came from Newborough, Anglesey. The church porch houses part of a cross head in the shape of a wheel, dating from the 9th or 10th century; part of the rest of the cross is in the churchyard, but it has suffered significant weather damage with most of the patterns worn away. The oldest graves are to the north of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the southern part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required. The path between the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement. The churchyard has seven gravestones that were discovered in the walls of the previous church. Six of them date from between the 9th and 11th centuries, and the seventh is from the 12th or 13th century. The doorway from the old church, dating from the 15th century, has been reused as an entrance to the churchyard. A carved stone human head, from the 12th century, has been inserted into the north wall of the churchyard. A war memorial in the shape of a Celtic cross remembers those who died during the First and Second World Wars. Assessment The early gravestones in the churchyard The church is a Grade II listed building ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales) states that it has been listed because it is \\"a mid 19th-century rural church, consistently articulated and detailed in an Early English style.\\" The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis said that the rebuilt church \\"forms a very good specimen of the early English style of architecture\\", adding that it was \\"effective from its simplicity and the absence of pretension.\\" He added that the interior had been \\"fitted up in a neat and appropriate manner, and the details throughout appear to have been carefully studied\\". A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that the \\"impressive\\" tower and steeple\\" form \\"a landmark visible for many miles.\\" It also comments that rendering on part of the tower and the south wall makes them less attractive than the north wall. A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region notes the \\"exceptional number of inscribed fragments\\", showing it to be a place of early Christian worship, but considers that the church is \\"unlovely\\". Similarly, a 2005 guide to Wales describes St Caffo's as \\"an uninspiring nineteenth-century church from the outside\\" but says that it has \\"a remarkable collection\\" of memorial stones.

History  The first Hospital in Bend named St. Charles was built in 1922 on \\"Hospital Hill\\" located in downtown Bend. The building was named in honor of Bishop Charles Joseph O'Reilly, the first bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baker. This building was to replace a house at 930 Broadway that the Sisters of St. Joseph of Tipton, Indiana were using for medical facilities. In 1951 a more modern facility was built on the Hospital Hill site. In 1972 the Sisters of St. Joseph transferred the assets of the hospital to a new not for profit corporation called St. Charles Memorial Hospital Inc. On October 12, 1975 the new St. Charles Medical Center was dedicated. In March 1977 the old St. Charles Memorial Hospital building was demolished. on January 1, 2001 Central Oregon District Hospital and St. Charles Medical Center merged to create Cascade Healthcare Services, later renamed to Cascade Healthcare Community, inc. As part of the merger the hospital was renamed to Central Oregon Community Hospital. In 2003 the hospital's name was changed again to the current St. Charles Medical Center Redmond. On February 15, 2010 the Catholic Diocese of Baker announced its intention to dissolve the official sponsorship relationship of St. Charles Medical Center-Bend by the Catholic Church. As part of the announcement both the Church and CHC said \\"very little will change at St. Charles Bend as a result of this decision. However, Catholic Mass will no longer be celebrated in the hospital's chapel, and all items considered Catholic will be removed from the hospital and returned to the church.\\" The dissolution of the Church's sponsorship ended a 92-year relationship.

Life The youngest son of Sir Bevil Grenville, he was born 13 February 1637 and baptised at Kilkhampton, Cornwall. He matriculated as a gentleman-commoner of Exeter College, Oxford on 6 August 1658. He graduated MA in convocation 28 September 1660 and DD on 28 February 1671.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Greenhill-Gysby About 1660 he married Anne, fourth and youngest daughter of Bishop John Cosin. Richard Sanderson ordained him in 1661 and, on 10 July in the same year, he succeeded, on the presentation of his eldest brother, John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath, to the family living of Kilkhampton. Lord Bath also obtained for him a promise of the next vacant fellowship at Eton College. Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, resisted this arrangement, but the king sent a peremptory mandate directing that it should be fulfilled. Before the next vacancy (in 1669) Granville exchanged the reversion for the prebendal stall of Langtoft in York Cathedral, held by Timothy Thriscrosse. He was collated to the first stall in Durham Cathedral on 18 September 1662. He was appointed to the archdeaconry of Durham, with the rectory of Easington annexed, in September 1662, and in 1664 to the rectory of Elwick Hall. He resigned Elwick Hall in 1667 on his institution to the rectory of Sedgefield, and in 1668 he surrendered the first for the second stall, being installed on 16 February 1668. With the assistance of Bishop Nathaniel Crew he obtained, in spite of Archbishop William Sancroft's opposition, the deanery of Durham, to which he was instituted on 9 December 1684. Granville then vacated his stall, but held at the same time the deanery and archdeaconry of Durham, and the rectory of Sedgefield, described in his own words as \\"the best deanery, the best archdeaconry, and one of the best livings in England.\\" He managed, however, to get into debt, and while Archdeacon of Durham and one of the king's chaplains in ordinary, he was arrested within the cloisters of the cathedral and imprisoned, though claiming his privileges. The matter was brought before the king in council, when he was freed, and the offending officials were punished. His wife suffered from \\"occasional attacks of mental excitement\\"; Granville was estranged from her father and her sister, Lady Gerrard. During 1678 and 1679 he retired with his sister, Lady Joanna Thornhill and her family to Tour D'Aigues in Provence. Granville was a High Church cleric who worked at Durham to promote a weekly service of Holy Communion in the cathedral and continue John Cosin's line; he tried to use the cathedral as a seminary to fill the canon positions. He supported James II, and on William of Orange's landing raised ¬£700 from the prebendaries of Durham for the king, giving ¬£100 himself. He addressed the clergy of his archdeaconry on behalf of James, and even after Durham had been surprised by William's followers (Sunday, 9 December 1688) Granville delivered a loyal sermon. At midnight on 11 December he fled to Carlisle, and a few days later was taken on the border with Scotland, and was robbed of his horses and money. They were recovered by him when he had been brought back to Carlisle, and after a short stay at Durham he succeeded in escaping to Edinburgh and landing at Honfleur (19 March 1689). His wife was left destitute, but by order of the chapter of Durham she received an allowance. His goods at Durham were distrained by the sheriff for debt; Sir George Wheler purchased the dean's library for ¬£221. Through family influence Grenville retained the revenues of his preferment for a time; but when he declined to take the oaths of allegiance to William III and Mary II he was deprived of them from 1 February 1691. Except in February 1690, when he came incognito into England but was recognised at Canterbury, and a second visit in April 1695, he remained in France. James nominated him for the archbishopric of York on the death of Lamplugh, and he was well treated by the ex-king's wife. Sums of money were occasionally sent to him from England, especially by Sir George Wheler and Thomas Higgons his nephew who were threatened with prosecution in 1698 by Sir George's son-in-law, an attorney with whom he had quarrelled. Granville was the most important churchman who accompanied James into exile, but was not allowed to perform the Anglican service; attempts were made to convert him to Catholicism. He lived first at Rouen, from 1698 to 1701 at Tremblay, and later at Corbeil. He fell ill at Corbeil on the night of 12 April 1703, was taken to Paris, and died on 18 April. His body was buried privately at night at the lower end of the consecrated ground of the Holy Innocents churchyard in Paris. The funeral was at the cost of Mary of Modena and attended by Dr Ralph Taylor, Anglican chaplain to the court. His wife died in October 1691, and was buried in Durham Cathedral. Works Grenville when an undergraduate at Oxford contributed verses to the university collection of loyal poems printed in 1660, with the title of Britannia Rediviva. On his appointment to the archdeaconry of Durham in 1662 he issued and reissued in the next year Article of Enquiry concerning Matters Ecclesiastical for the officials of every parish in the diocese. In 1664 he printed a sermon and a letter, entitled \\"The Compleat Conformist, or Seasonable Advice concerning strict Conformity and frequent Celebration of the Holy Communion\\". He addressed to his nephew Thomas Higgons, son of his sister, Bridget Grenville, by Sir Thomas Higgons, in 1685, an anonymous volume of 'Counsel and Directions, Divine and Moral, in Plain and Familiar Letters of Advice.' When in exile at Rouen he printed twenty copies of 'The Resigned and Resolved Christian and Faithful and Undaunted Royalist in two plain farewell Sermons and a loyal farewell Visitation Speech. Whereunto are added certaine letters to his relations and friends in England.' Letters from him are printed in Thomas Comber's Life of Thomas Comber, pp. 139‚Äì334. John Locke when in France in 1678 wrote three letters to Granville.Two of them are in Addit. MS. 4290 at the British Museum, all three are printed in Fox Bourne's John Locke, i. 387-97. A narrative of his life was composed by a cleric named Beaumont of the Diocese of Durham. Two collections of his remains were made by the Surtees Society.One (pt. i. of vol. xxxvii. of their Transactions) was taken from a book in the Durham Cathedral library, consisting of letters and other documents collected by Dr. Hunter, the antiquary. The other (vol. xlvii. of the Surtees Society) was based on papers in the Bodleian Library. George Granville, 1st Baron Lansdowne pronounced a eulogy on his virtues.

An early reference to the canal as \\"the Rhine\\" appears in the 1853 book White, Red, Black, in which traveler Ferenc Pulszky wrote, \\"The Germans live all together across the Miami Canal, which is, therefore, here jocosely called the 'Rhine'.\\" In 1875 writer Daniel J.

Thus along with immigrants it attracted a concentration of bootleggers, saloons, gambling houses, dance halls, brothels, and others who were not tolerated in the city of Cincinnati. In 1850 approximately 63% of Over-the-Rhine's population consisted of immigrants from German states, including Prussia, Bavaria, and Saxony.Miller and Tucker 1999, pg. 1History of the Brewery District. Accessed on 5/24/2009 The neighborhood soon took on a \\"German\\" character influenced by its majority of residents. The new immigrants brought a variety of customs, habits, attitudes, and dialects of the German language. Their range of religions, occupations, and classes characterized the Over-the-Rhine German community for the rest of the century. The community was served by several German newspapers, including the Volksfreund, Volksblatt, and the Freie Presse. German entrepreneurs gradually built up a profitable brewing industry, which became identified with Over-the-Rhine and the city. The brewing industry was concentrated along McMicken Avenue and the Miami and Erie canal with the Jackson Brewery, J. G. John & Sons Brewery, Christian Moerlein Brewing Company, and John Kauffman Brewing Company in this area, and John Hauck and Windisch-Mulhauser Brewing Companies across the canal in the West End. By 1880 Cincinnati was recognized as the \\"Beer Capital of the World\\", with Over-the- Rhine its center of brewing. Wielert's, one of Over-the-Rhine's most popular beer gardens, in 1875 During the nineteenth century, most Cincinnatians regarded Over-the-Rhine as the city's premier entertainment district.

Throughout the 19th century, residents of the city suffered epidemics of cholera,Greve (1904), pg. 587 small pox,Greve (1904), pg. 951 and typhoid fever. These were often spread by travelers on the many steamboats on the river, and through the water supply because of poor sanitation. The epidemics killed thousands in Cincinnati alone, and created panic in the population. Before medicine understood how such diseases were spread, many people believed that vapor from the canal caused malaria.Grace and White 2003, pg. 40. The association of disease with the canal was used in later arguments for converting it for use as a subway and parkway.Singer 2003, p. 18 In addition to overcrowding and disease, those who lived in the river basin suffered from flooding, open sewers, and polluting industrial smoke. Riots in 1853, 1855, and 1884 began or took place in Over-the-Rhine. Those who could afford to relocate to the new suburbs in the surrounding hills did so.Miller and Tucker 1999, pg. 5 Christian Moerlein Brewery around the turn of the 20th century The neighborhood, and upper Vine Street in particular, consisted of saloons, restaurants, shooting galleries, arcades, gambling dens, dance halls, burlesque halls, and theaters. Starting in the 1840s, the number of saloons in the area grew steadily.Holian (2000), Vol. 1, pg. 141 The number of saloons on the main streets in 1890 ranged from 34 on Court Street up to 136 on Vine Street.Holian (2000), Vol. 1, pg. 142 Nearly 20 years after its favorable review, the 1893 edition of Illustrated Cincinnati noted, \\"All or nearly all the leading characteristics [of Over-the-Rhine] which won for it the appellation have passed away. ... The only thing this section of the city is now noted for besides noisy concert and drinking halls and cheap theaters is the great breweries, for which Cincinnati has become so renowned.\\"Kenny, D.J. (1893) Illustrated Guide to Cincinnati and The World's Columbian Exposition. Robert Clarke & Co, Cincinnati. The Pacific Publishing Co. pp. 194-195. At the turn of the 20th century, the neighborhood population reached a peak of 45,000 residents, with the proportion of German-Americans estimated at 75 percent. By 1915 the more prosperous people left the dense city for the suburbs. They were not replaced in as great numbers because new immigrants were attracted to fast-growing industrial cities in the Great Lakes region.Miller and Tucker 1999, pg. 6 Over-the-Rhine became one of several old and declining neighborhoods that formed a ring of slums around the central business district. Many people thought Over-the-Rhine would eventually disappear, swallowed up by the city's growing business district. Economic decline The canal, facing east toward the Elm Street bridge, before it was drained in 1920 Many German-Americans felt a sense of pride for their homeland; they celebrated early victories by Germany during World War I. Cincinnati's German language newspapers, the Volksblatt and the Freie Presse were especially vocal.Behr (1996), pg. 66. As the likelihood of the United States entering the war increased, the pro-German rhetoric of Cincinnati's German-American population angered some Americans, especially \\"nativists\\" who distrusted whether the ethnic Germans were loyal to the United States.Behr (1996), pg. 67. After the US entered the war, anti-German sentiment increased across the country. In 1917, the year the United States declared war on Germany, half of the city's residents could speak German, and many spoke only German.Behr (1996), p. 64 The community had organized German schools and frequently held religious services in German at many churches. In 1918, the government required German men who had not become naturalized citizens to register as alien enemies.Goodman, Rebecca.\\"WWI brought out anti-German sentiment\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, Accessed on 2009-05-24 The New York Times reported, \\"When one spoke of going 'over the Rhine', as the canal was called, he meant that he was disappearing into a realm where all English was left behind.\\" The city passed an ordinance to change all German street names in the city. In Over- the-Rhine, Bremen Street was changed to Republic and Hanover became Yukon Street.Tolzmann, Don Heinrich. (2006) German Cincinnati, p. 111. Arcadia Publishing. , As happened in some other areas of the country with numerous ethnic Germans, the state closed German-language schools, dismissed teachers of German, and banned German-language classes from all public schools. The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County withdrew all German books from its shelves.Cincinnati Enquirer \\"2000: Cincinnati's Century of Change\\", Enquirer, Accessed on 2009-05-24. Many German Americans anglicized their names out of fear of persecution. Some businesses with German names changed them to survive the anti-war sentiment. Cincinnati's German heritage continued to be suppressed until after World War II, a war in which Germany again was opposed by the United States. Although the effort to gain Prohibition of alcohol had long been part of late nineteenth-century reform movements, during the war it became associated with anti-German sentiment. People who opposed Prohibition were accused of being \\"pro-German\\".Holian (2001), pg. 12. With the war still underway the majority of Cincinnatians voted in favor of prohibition as did a sufficient number of states. Nearly overnight Over-the-Rhine's 30 breweries, all of them German-American owned,Behr (1996), p. 65 were closed. Most saloons and breweries tried to serve and brew \\"near beer\\" and soft drinks, but few survived. By the end of the 1920s, the demise of the Cincinnati brewing industry was virtually complete, and the city's three most prominent breweries were permanently closed--Moerlein, Hauck, and Windisch-Muhlhauser.Holian (2001), pp. 9 and 53 With the heart of its economic engine gone Over-the-Rhine began a slip into decades of economic decline, which prevented new development and ironically helped preserve much of the neighborhood's historic architecture. The Miami and Erie canal became obsolete as a means of transportation, and was abandoned by the city in 1877. The canal was like an open sewer within the city, as sanitation systems were limited.Over-the-Rhine Foundation, \\"A Very Brief History of Cincinnati's Subway\\" , Over the Rhine Foundation, Accessed on 2009-07-24. In 1920 the city drained the canal and began construction of the Cincinnati Subway in the canal bed. Central Parkway, which follows the path of the canal, runs over top of the subway system's tunnels. Construction of the subway stalled halfway through the project, as the city was overcome by unexpected inflation following World War I. Distractions by the Great Depression, World War II, and subsequent popularity of the automobile prevented the city from ever gaining enough local support to finish it. Starting in the 1920s, the city government decided to take drastic efforts to revitalize Cincinnati. The city intended to clear older buildings and homes which had fallen into disrepair.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 6 Older buildings in disrepair were called slums, and viewed as infectious, as if left unchecked they would infect and destroy nearby neighborhoods.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. xviii The 1925 master plan called for razing residential buildings in the West End and Over-the-Rhine, and rezoning the basin for commercial, industrial, and civic uses only.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 12Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 18 Given the stock market \\"Crash\\" and the onset of the Great Depression, the Planning Commission delayed razing residential housing in the basin or rezoning that area.Miller and Tucker (1999), p. 22 In the 1930s some attempts were made to secure business loans for the clearance of the West End and Over-the-Rhine, but all failed due to the lack of local financing.Miller and Tucker (1999), p. 23 By the 1950s, the city leaders ruled out slum clearance, believing it too closely resembled the abuses of social engineering committed by the Nazi and Soviet governments against their own people. Instead, with the evolution of civic theories and appreciation for historic architecture, they began to reconsider Over-the- Rhine as a historic area worth preserving.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 47  Appalachian neighborhood  Aerial view of Over-the-Rhine In the 1940s the booming war-stimulated industrial economy had drawn hundreds of thousands of migrants from Appalachia to cities such as Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Cincinnati.Borgman and Obermiller (1994), p. 121. In the 1950s, the automation of mining and the popularity of oil made the demand for coal sharply drop. In search of work, coal miners from Kentucky and West Virginia flocked to Cincinnati and settled in older neighborhoods, such as Lower Price Hill and Over-the-Rhine, where housing was cheaper.Borgman and Obermiller (1994), pg. 171. Both neighborhoods were also adjacent to the highly industrialized Mill Creek Valley, where work was within walking distance. In the 1960s the \\"mountaineers\\" were so prevalent that the city had plans to use Over-the-Rhine as a \\"port of entry\\" for all white Appalachian migrants.Miller and Tucker (1999), p. 75. Appalachians were considered a distinct ethnic group with special needs, who suffered from prejudices and negative stereotypes just as other minority groups did.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 78. Some Appalachians struggled in the urban environment, due to indifference toward formal education, suspicion of modern medical practices, pride in poverty as a religious virtue, and racial prejudices.Miller and Tucker (1999), pp. 62-63. To showcase mountain culture and handicrafts, the city organized its first Cincinnati Appalachian Festival, held at the Music Hall in 1971. Still held annually, the festival has moved to the city's Coney Island due to its growth in size.Appalachian Community Development Association, The Appalachian Community Development Association's Organizational History .

During the 1950s and 1960s the city constructed the Mill Creek Expressway, now part of I-75, to accommodate the vastly increased use of cars. Its construction, along with the Queensgate industrial development and various public housing projects, meant the destruction of the West End, a historically black neighborhood.Miller and Tucker (1999), p. 69. The construction displaced more than 50,000 predominantly black and low-income residents.Over-the-Rhine in August 1973\\\\.

Accessed on June 13, 2009 Turf wars resulted between the young men of both races, leading to residents' and officials' worries about a possible race riot.Miller and Tucker (1999), p. 77. The conversion of Over-the-Rhine into a black neighborhood was a result of \\"white flight\\" to the suburbs. Newer housing and more space was available, new highways made commuting easier, and some jobs shifted to the suburbs. In Over-the-Rhine some buildings still didn't have running water. The suburbs were also perceived as much safer. The Cincinnati Strangler, a black man who raped and murdered six white women in the mid-1960s, aggravated racist phobias. Race riots in 1967 and 1968 started in the black Avondale neighborhood and spread to nearby neighborhoods like Over-the-Rhine. Between 1960 and 1980 Over-the-Rhine lost 84 percent of its white population. The black population peaked at about 7,300 in 1980, but was still relatively small compared to the 27,000 whites who had occupied the neighborhood just 20 years earlier. From 1980 to 2000 Over-the-Rhine lost both black and white residents, but lost white residents at a higher rate. In 1980, an unemployed artist took a local newsroom hostage after murdering his girlfriend in his Over-the-Rhine apartment. In an interview forced at gunpoint he talked about various inner city social problems before killing himself.  Concentration of social services and preservation  Looking north up Vine Street, into Over-the- Rhine, in 1973. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city created many social service facilities in Over-the-Rhine, but concentrated redevelopment projects in the central business district.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 59. By the late 1970s, the city hoped to reinvest in Over-the-Rhine through historic preservation and encourage more affluent residents.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 84. Community organizers opposed the plan, fearing that uncontrolled redevelopment would uproot the poor and involuntarily push them out of their homes and neighborhood. Gentrification would displace the poor due to higher rentsQuinlivan (2001) 5:00 and would inflict \\"psychological, social, and economic stress and family strains.\\"Miller and Tucker (1999), p. 101. Buddy Gray, the Drop Inn Center homeless shelter ownerDrop Inn Center History Accessed on 2010-03-05. was known in City Hall for an \\"in-your-face, shout- them-down style of confrontation\\". He emerged as the leader of the anti- displacement faction known as the Over-the-Rhine People's Movement (OTRPM). Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 105. OTRPM desired new job opportunities for residents. It also supported mixed-income and private development in Over-the- Rhine, but only if policies were put in place to protect the current residents from being pushed out. Gray's leadership empowered Over-the-Rhine's poor as a political force, and pushed city government to expand permanent low-income housing in Over-the-Rhine as a means to combat displacement.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 124. His allies saw him as a \\"charitable humanitarian friend of the homeless\\",Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 139. but his enemies saw \\"a poverty pimp\\" who wanted to mold Over-the-Rhine into a \\"super ghetto\\". Allies of Gray's faction included the Over-the-Rhine Community Council, the Drop Inn Center, Over-the-Rhine Community Housing (a result of the merger between ReSTOC and OTRHN in 2006), the Coalition for the Homeless, and the Peaslee Neighborhood Coalition. Historic preservationists saw Over-the-Rhine as an \\"irreplaceable architectural and historic resource\\" and wanted it added to the National Register of Historic Places to help protect it.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 113. Gray was opposed to designation because it would create eligibility for Federal tax credits of 25% for developers of income-producing housing. He asserted this would lead to displacement of the poor. Preservationists argued that displacement was caused by disinvestment (not reinvestment), that displacement did not automatically follow a National Register listing, and that with a 24% vacancy rate in Over-the-Rhine, there was room for middle and upper-income housing.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 127. Additionally, they demonstrated that the National Register listing would provide one of the few sources of funds for subsidizing low-income housing.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 135. Allies of this faction included the Over-the-Rhine Foundation, Over-the-Rhine Chamber of Commerce, businesses, and real-estate developers. In 1980, at the public hearing for Over-the-Rhine's nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, Buddy Gray rallied some 250 protesters to the event. Gray and his allies forced a three-year delay on the Register's decision.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 115.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 128. In 1983 Over-the-Rhine was rejected from the Register by a narrow 8 to 7 vote.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 132. Supporters of historic designation appealed the board's decision to the keeper of the National Register, Carol Shull, who favored adding Over-the-Rhine to the Register. Over-the-Rhine was added to the National Register in May 1983.Miller and Tucker (1999), p. 136. Buddy Gray vowed to make the expansion of low- income housing in Over-the-Rhine his top priority.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 148. In 1985 Gray pushed a plan through city council that would allow some upper-income residents to settle in the neighborhood, but only after permanent low-income housing was established.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 151.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 169. The plan reserved \\"a minimum of 5,520 [low-income housing] units\\" out of Over-the-Rhine's 11,000 possible units. That figure was almost identical to the number of occupied units.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 133. Public money would not be spent on upper income housing until the \\"5,520\\" goal was met,Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 149. and a housing retention ordinance meant low-income housing could not be torn down unless it was replaced.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 137. Jim Tarbell, \\"the most adamant and voluble opponent\\" of Gray's plan,Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 138. warned that it guaranteed the persistence of Over-the-Rhine as \\"a predominantly black enclave of poverty and despair\\", but City Council ignored him, believing the plan was a compromise.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 159. Preservationists found little local support as other Cincinnati neighborhoods feared displacement would move the city's poor, and crime, closer to home. Over the next seven years the plan failed to produce balance in its residential population, nor did it attract commercial or industrial initiatives.Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 160. By 1990 Over-the-Rhine contained 2,500 government- subsidized low-income housing units (compared to virtually none in 1970) and had become one of the most economically distressed areas in the United States.3CDC, Over-the-Rhine Overview .

No one seriously challenged the 1985 plan until 1992, when Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME) assailed Over-the-Rhine as on path toward a \\"permanent low income, one- race ghetto; a stagnant, decaying 'reservation' for the poor at the doorstep to downtown.\\" In 1993 Over-the-Rhine's housing policy was changed after several small-business owners filed a lawsuit, calling the policy \\"racial and economic segregation\\".Miller and Tucker (1999), pg. 214. The city settled out of court and agreed to eliminate low-income housing as Over-the-Rhine's top priority. In 1996, the city invited the Urban Land Institute (ULI) to study Over-the-Rhine and create a plan for revitalization. ULI recommended the creation of a bi-partisan \\"Over-the-Rhine Coalition\\" to reach compromise between the polarized, deadlocked neighborhood factions. Gray refused to participate in the coalition unless specific demands were met, believing the city-funded ULI study was meant to derail his efforts to preserve low-income housing in the neighborhood. ULI panelists questioned whether Gray had too much power over City Hall, and asked the city to question whether they should continue to fund Gray--whom they considered \\"an impediment to revitalization\\". Later that year, near a critical point in negotiations, Buddy Gray was shot to death by a mentally-ill homeless man whom he had helped. After Gray's murder his allies were not able to recreate his leadership, and the Over-the-Rhine Coalition was formed. Gray's legacy lived on through the Drop Inn Center and ReSTOC, his low-income housing cooperative. ReSTOC was one of the neighborhood's largest property owners, and at one point owned 71 parcels in Over-the-Rhine.iRhine.com, ReSTOC's FATE . Accessed on 2010-07-29.

The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that despite receiving millions of dollars from federal, state, and local governments to develop low- income housing ReSTOC \\"actually reduced the number of occupied apartments\\". In 2002 the city forced ReSTOC to sell some of its properties and use funds from those sales to maintain and improve the other properties it owned.

Main Street and Digital Rhine  In the 1980s struggling, predominately white artists discovered Main Street's vacant buildings and cheap rents. A bar and nightclub called Neons opened on Main Street in 1984, which would grow in popularity and serve as the catalyst for the Main Street Entertainment District that \\"blossomed\\" in the 1990s.Over-the- Rhine Chamber of Commerce, History of Over-the-Rhine Chamber of Commerce. Accessed on 2009-06-19. One by one coffee shops, galleries, breweries, and bars began opening on the six blocks between Central Parkway and Liberty Street. Main Street was full of artists and had a thriving arts scene, but they were eventually displaced to Northside after the street's growing popularity enticed landlords to raise rents. At its height Main Street's numerous clubs, restaurants, and bars attracted nearly a million visitors a year. Locals had mixed reactions to the change, with some complaining that the young, primarily white bar hoppers from the suburbs trashed, abused, and disrespected the street while others saw the 1990s as Main Street's \\"Golden Era\\". By the late 1990s there were about 19 clubs and bars on Main Street. In 1996 the city was stunned by the murder-robbery of a popular, young white musician in a parking lot after his performance. Locals acted quickly to protect Main Street's image as a safe destination, although the highly publicized shooting has been cited as the beginning of Main Street's decline. Annually, the street hosted Jammin' on Main, which featured nationally known bands. During a Seven Mary Three show in 1996 a rowdy crowd of mosh-pitters tore down a \\"flimsy\\" barrier in front of the stage. Cincinnati police in riot gear stopped the show and \\"pepper-gassed anyone who seemed reluctant to leave\\". During the late 1990s Main Street became the center of Cincinnati's dot-com boom, mostly due to its cheap rents and proximity to Main Street's non-tech businesses. Nicknamed \\"Digital Rhine\\", the area had at least 10 Internet startups, and one startup sold to eBay in 1999 for $85 million. Digital Rhine slowly disappeared after the dot-com bubble burst in 2001.

For an hour they threw stones and bottles at police in riot gear and smashed in the station's front door before police opened fire with bean bags, rubber bullets, and tear gas.

Those involved in the rebellion threw bricks through car windows, targeted and beat white motorists, smashed storefronts and looted businesses, set dozens of fires throughout the city, shot at police, and more. Main Street was targeted by those involved in the rebellion, according to some of the businesses there. Of those who were arrested for rioting, 70% were not residents of Over-the-Rhine, and 86% were African-American males. The total cost of damage to the city was at least $13.7 million. Further decline The riots, the largest urban disorder in the United States since the Los Angeles riots of 1992,Waddington (2007), pg. 64. effectively killed the Over-the-Rhine renaissance of the late 1990s and set the neighborhood back a decade. Police, who felt scapegoated as the cause of the rebellion, began an unofficial \\"work slowdown\\" where they made far fewer arrests and some began looking for jobs in the suburbs.

Businesses moved to other neighborhoods because customers were too frightened to visit Over-the-Rhine, and Main Street lost much of its nightlife to places like Newport, Northside, and Hyde Park. After the 2001 riots \\"a huge number of people\\" left Over-the- Rhine, leaving 500 of the neighborhood's 1,200 buildings vacant and property values extremely low. Also in 2001, Over-the-Rhine's largest Section 8 landlord declared bankruptcy. This combined with skyrocketing crime prompted many to use their vouchers to voluntarily move out of the neighborhood. Redevelopment After the 2001 riots, Mayor Charlie Luken dismissed the planning department, believing the city was not good at economic development and that previous studies had been ineffective . Luken met with Procter & Gamble CEO A.G. Lafley, and the two announced the creation of a nonprofit to redevelop Over-the-Rhine and the city's business district, named Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation (3CDC). The nonprofit, consisting mainly of Cincinnati's business community, raised millions of dollars from a combination the city grants, corporate philanthropy, and federal tax credits. In 2003 a bankrupt landlord auctioned off 1,600 low-income apartments. Cincinnati's corporate and philanthropic elite began buying entire blocks at a time, with the largest player being the 3CDC. 3CDC immediately encountered resistance from the neighborhood's homeless advocates, who claimed they were displacing the poor, but according to 3CDC \\"at least 90 percent\\" of the buildings the agency bought were vacant. As a non-government entity, it became more difficult to slow or stop 3CDC's projects compared to those created by City Hall. Re-developed buildings in the Gateway Quarter at 12th and Vine Streets Since 2004, 3CDC has invested $84 million in 152 seriously deteriorated buildings and 165 vacant parcels. In April 2009 3CDC reported 70% of the 100 condos in the Gateway Quarter had been sold, with 80% of the buyers being 35 years old or younger. In February 2010 3CDC reported the redevelopment of nearly 200 condominiums and more than 30 new storefronts, with 60% of those being sold despite a down housing market. According to 3CDC, 2010 will be their most ambitious year yet with $164 million in redevelopment projects, most centered in Over-the-Rhine. By 2012 3CDC expects to deliver 150 new apartments, another dozen renovated condos, and new office space. In 2004 the Art Academy of Cincinnati moved from its Mount Adams location to 12th and Jackson streets in Over-the-Rhine.

It does so by creating a global research community, planning and coordinating new science programmes that no single nation can achieve alone, exchanging scientific information, and sharing new technologies and facilities. InterRidge is dedicated to reaching out to the public, scientists and governments, and to providing a unified voice for ocean ridge researchers worldwide. It was launched in 1992, and in 2011 InterRidge has 6 principal, 3 associate, and 21 corresponding member nations and regions. InterRidge has more than 2500 individual member scientists in disciplines ranging from marine geology to chemistry, biology, and ocean engineering. The InterRidge Office rotates every 3 years. During 2013-2015, InterRidge is being hosted by the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Geophysics, Peking University, Beijing, China. InterRidge is governed by a steering committee consisting of delegates from the principal and associate member nations and regions.  Main functions  InterRidge has four main functions, which may be summarised as: # Building a community of ridge scientists # Identifying important scientific questions through working groups and workshops # Acting as a voice for ridge scientists # Education and outreach. InterRidge serves as a \\"clearinghouse\\" for information on mid-ocean ridge research across the globe. InterRidge publishes an annual newsletter with preliminary results from field work, national and regional reports, and working group updates. InterRidge maintains 3 databases: *member database *research cruise database (past and upcoming cruises to the ridge crest) *database of active hydrothermal vent fields Development = First decade = InterRidge began at a meeting in France in 1990 that gathered ridge scientists from 10 nations and regions with reports submitted by Canada, France, Iceland, Japan, Portugal, USSR, UK, and USA. The rationale for this meeting developed from a recommendation at a previous U.S. RIDGE initiative workshop that an international initiative be pursued. Following the first InterRidge meeting, an \\"Interim Steering Group\\" was formed and the first programme plan was produced in 1992. As stated on the InterRidge website, the first decade (1992-2003) of the organisation \\"produced a coordinated, international ridge community of member countries that had previously been working alone, and left a string of success stories in its wake. Two examples are the first-ever mapping and sampling of one of the slowest spreading and remote centres known to date, the Gakkel Ridge in the Arctic Ocean, and the exploration and study of the Southwest Indian Ridge.\\"http://www.whoi.edu/science/GG/interridge/oldIR/SCIENCE/Historic_WG/SWIRWG.html = Second decade= Two functions of InterRidge were developed more fully in the second decade (2004-2013) of the organisation: # The scientific working groups # Education and outreach Scientific working groups are a key metric for success as to how InterRidge is delivering on its mission. These working groups are proposed by an international group of scientists, usually following a call for proposals issued by the InterRidge Office. Working groups in 2011 are Hydrothermal Energy and Ocean Carbon Cycles, Long-Range Exploration, Mantle Imaging, Seafloor Mineralisation, and Vent Ecology. In 2008, InterRidge began offering fellowships for student research projects, and in 2009 InterRidge began a partnership with the International Seabed Authority Endowment Fund to expand the programme into the InterRidge Student and Postdoctoral Fellowship Programme. In 2011, InterRidge began a \\"Cruise Travel Bursary\\" scheme to enable early-career scientists to participate in research cruises. Associated research In 2009, scientists from USA, Japan and the UK laid the foundations for finding the deepest-ever hydrothermal vents, in a research cruise to the Mid-Cayman Rise, in April 2010. Ridge-crest scientists are also exploring the East Scotia Ridge in the Southern Ocean, part of a 3-year programme, as well as the Russian branch of InterRidge which has studied hydrothermal clusters along part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As economic growth puts pressure on resources, new sources of minerals and materials are needed, and licences are being sought for the exploration of seafloor massive sulphides. InterRidge coordinates neutral scientific input to these discussions.http://s3.amazonaws.com/files.posterous.com/jeanraymondboulle/pznhCLByqoT7XLFy4znWtlJNrgmgBaRwTBz3Jn5hjMdN9P5E9C6nI5ThTVYQ/SMS_Deposits.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=1C9REJR1EMRZ83Q7QRG2&Expires;=1296565595&Signature;=D83wWyBCEGzUBOiUnoFkzZ0GzIE%3D  Interactions with international organisations  InterRidge is an affiliated program to SCOR (Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research), has a liaison to IODP (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program), and is in close communication with other organizations such as ChEss (Chemosynthetic Ecosystem science), a field project of the Census of Marine Life programme (CoML).

He died of complications of diabetes. He was one of the most popular artists of his generation, of the romantic tradition, producing many paintings of various themes (portraits, country and village scenes, and allusions to history), including a series on the Swiss national hero William Tell. He formally took the name St√ºckelberg in 1881; this was duly registered by the Basel authorities. Background & early art school St√ºckelberg came from an aristocratic Basel family, son of Emanuel Stickelberger and Susanna Berry. Following the early death of his father in 1833, he was brought up by his uncle, the architect Melchior Berry, to whom he was apprenticed. His leanings were towards art, having had formative school instruction under Hieronymus Hess and Ludwig Adam Kelterborn. So, after six months with his uncle, encouraged by Jacob Burckhardt, his mother's brother-in-law, he started studies with the portrait painter Johann Friedrich Dietler in Bern, continuing till 1850. He then was sent for academic training in Antwerp at the Academy of Fine Arts of Antwerp. His teachers in Antwerp included Gustaf Wappers, Louis Gallait and Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans.Franz Zelger, 'Der Historienmaler Ernst St√ºckelberg: 1831 bis 1903', Juris-Verlag, 1971, p. 21 This period of study was intensive but St√ºckelberg made contact with an international array of enthusiasts: Hendrik Valkenberg from Amsterdam, Ernst Rietschel from Dresden, Knud Bergslien from Voss, Norway, Hans Peter Feddersen from Holstein, as well as Ludwig Burger from Berlin, Moritz Delfs from Holstein, and Theodor von Deschwanden from Stans whose portraits he painted (1852). From this period, a total of 44 aquarel portraits exist, and numerous sketch books; in his second year, 1851, St√ºckelberg won first prize in the \\"Concours\\". One early painting of this time, Elijah brings the widow of Zarepath her resuscitated child (1852), is notable for its vivacity.Albert Gessler, Erinnerungen von Ernst St√ºckelberg von Basel (1831-1903), Schweiz verlag, Zurich, 1903 (German) Experience in Paris and Munich Having become acquainted with French art, he was further drawn to Paris, where he arrived during the period of Louis Napol√©on's coup d'√©tat of 1851. He met many other artists there, principally Theodor von Deschwanden, August Weckesser, Ludwig Knaus and Anselm Feuerbach. He copied works of Rembrandt, Velazquez, van Dyck, Corregio and Veronese in the Louvre. In 1853, after sketching in the Valais, the Simplon region and the Valtellina, the Tirol and Milan, he returned to Basel, but set off again for Munich to study miniature painting at the Academy of Fine Arts under Moritz von Schwind for three years, meeting Wilhelm von Kaulbach, Franz von Lenbach, Willhelm Busch and Heinrich Reimers in their studios, and painting their portraits. These latter had little influence on him, and St√ºckelberg retreated often to his rooms, somewhat disillusioned and also to escape the cholera in the city. From rather cramped quarters, he painted iconic Swiss historical themes, the best-known being: Melchtal returns to his blinded father (Landenberg's behest), The Sheriffs of Sarnen, The lady falconer, A girl in middle-age costume and Stauffacher's wife (calling her in- laws to fight for freedom), which last was purchased by the Confederation. An exhibition of his works back in Switzerland had caused a sensation, for which in 1856 St√ºckelberg was awarded the silver medal at the Berne Culture & Industry Exhibition of 1856. Sojourn in Italy Wedding Day in the Sabine Hills Returning for a short time to Basel, he painted King Henry II and Queen Cunigunde of Luxemburg (1855) on glass in the Minster, and Young upper class lady with a falcon (1856). He then set off for five months in Florence, and, encouraged insistently by Burckhardt, in Easter 1857 he left for Rome where he met old friends from Antwerp and Munich, Franz Dieber, Arnold B√∂cklin, Rudolf Henneberg and Anselm Feuerbach. The group would meet regularly in an Osteria or play Boccia. Other new influences included Kaspar von Zumbusch, Julius Moser, Polydore Beaufaux and Victor von Meyenberg. For some time he stayed with Fritz Simon at the house of Teresina Reinhardt at the Via della quattro Fontane 53, but during the heat of summer preferred to retreat to the country (as he had done from Munich) and establish himself in the Monti Sabini. He painted in Vicovaro, Cervara, and the village of Anticoli Corrado, where he integrated with the local people and had no shortage of models, including the local priest. Here he sketched, painted, and drew every facet of country life. From here stem seven albums of his output, as well as the famous works Evening in the Monti Sabini, A forest fountain and The Mary Procession (1858), the last of which hangs in the Kunstmuseum in Basel. This he placed on 24 January 1861 in a small room of the Basel Concert Hall for public viewing.Bernd Wolfgang Lindemann & Nikolaus Meier, Ernst St√ºckelberg 1831-1903, Schwabe, Basel 2003 (German) Italy was his homecoming as an artist: he subsequently visited the country over ten times. Nonetheless, he never left Basel as his base. Establishing himself as an artist Finally, St√ºckelberg returned in 1860 to Switzerland, establishing a studio in the Oberen Hirschengraben in Zurich. Monuments then being the rage, he was persuaded by Jacob Burckhardt to put in a design for the Battle of St. Jakob an der Birs (1444); this was rejected and a more conservative design chosen. In Zurich, St√ºckelberg befriended Rudolf Koller, Gottfried Keller (who greatly admired and extolled the virtues of the grand vistas of nature in St√ºckelberg's paintings),Gottfried Keller, Berner Bund, 12 January 1861 (German) Friedrich Theodor Vischer and Conrad Ferdinand Meyer. With his painter friend Rudolf Koller, St√ºckelberg travelled to his homes in Meiringen and Hasliberg, and also to Paris and Cologne, and with Professor Bernoulli, his aunt's brother, to Haarlem, Zandvoort, the Hague, Leyden, Antwerp, Brussels, and Treves. Another trip to Italy needed to be aborted because of fever, and he diverted to the Tessin, painting the atmospheric Evening in Tessin (1863) and thence to St Moritz to recover. Otherwise, between 1860 and 1865, he painted portraits: Pastor Schl√§pfer and his Wife, Miss Anne Bischoff, The Sarasin children, Colonel Merian, The Baroness of Blonay, Mrs Schl√§pfer with a child. A number of other important works also date from this time: A Young Italian, Woman from Haslital with a jug in her hand (1860), Baptismal procession in Upper Wallis, Procession of Madonna of the Mountain (1861), The children's service, Girl with a cat on the arm, Faust & Gretchen (1862), The Pilgrims of Pereto (1863), and Portrait of Colonel Rudolf Merian-Iselin (1864) - who as president of the Swiss Society of Arts, St√ºckelberg tried and failed to persuade to set up a Swiss Art School. Finally, Mariuccia at the Fountain (1863-5), which whilst executing St√ºckelberg said he was most in his element and most happy.Samuel Rocheblave, Ernst Stuckelberg, Sa Vie - Son Oeuvre, Fischbacher, Paris 1931 (French) He painted Felicetta, and Romeo and Julia in the Village in the early 1860s. This was exhibited at the Paris World Exhibition of 1867, and subsequently overpainted as Youthful Love and is now in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne. Marriage Portrait of In 1866, St√ºckelberg married Marie- Elisabeth Br√ºstlein, one of his art students, of an Alsatian family who had moved to Basel in 1852, born in Brooklyn, USA. He painted Portrait of the Bride and Self-portrait with a beret (1866-7). Their honeymoon, after some days in Wavre in Belgium, took them to Milan, Florence, Rome, Naples, Pompeii, Sorrento and Capri, from where many paintings stem typifying St√ºckelberg's grasp of light, colour and shade such as: Midday on Capri, Spring morning in Pompeii, and The Marionettes (1866-9), which accorded St√ºckelberg the Munich Gold Medal in 1869. Their first son, Ernst Alfred, was born in August 1867, and the family completed a trip via Bordeaux to Toledo and Madrid. Life surrounded by his family, with intervals in Amden, the Walensee, Kienberg in the Jura, and Montreux, occupied his time, evidenced by many paintings of children and home. These encapsulate a happy atmosphere, and scenes are painted with reality, stillness, even if including death, but with no sentimentality. The portraits of Margaret Bernoulli (n√©e Berry) (1867) and of Mrs Charlotte Kestner (1968), as well as Renunciation (1868) date from this period. Further children, Marie (May 1869) and Alfred (September 1870) were born, and St√ºckelberg travelled to Munich, Dresden, Kassel, and Paris as an established artist. Home at the Erimanshof In 1871, St√ºckelberg declined a professorship under Graf Kalckreuth in Weimar, preferring to remain in Basel. He purchased the Erimanshof, on Petersgraben, an ancient building adjacent to the Kreutztor, the other side of which stood the Seidenhof, on Blumenrain, dating from 1573. The painting that he had worked on in his studio in the house, The Painter's Family (1872), was shown at the World Exhibition of Vienna in 1873 and gained him the Knight's Cross of the Imperial Order of Franz-Joseph. He then proceeded over a period of 18 months between 1873 and 1874 to cover the walls of the Erimanshof with frescoes; these depicted the virtues Charity, Wisdom, Prudence, Diligence and Truth as feminine figures in alcoves, surrounded by decorative musical instruments, fruits, and animals. Wisdom was portrayed as a blonde teaching a boy to read his first word, amo, and Love as Marie-Elisabeth in an Italian hairstyle, with a child in her arms and two playing in the folds of her dress. This fusion of truth and poetry remained a constant theme with St√ºckelberg. The Kreutztor and the Erimanshof were destroyed in a traffic scheme of 1937, and the frescoes largely lost. Family life Three more children, Gertrude (December 1871), Vico (1872), and Adrien (April 1874), were born to the family, and St√ºckelberg produced more works, The love figure merchant (1872), At the fountain of Rocca Ceri (1874) and The Butterfly Catcher (1875). However, his wife fell ill and the latter part of 1875 and 1876 was spent recuperating on the C√¥te d'Azur. There, numerous sea scenes and more pictures were painted: Wandering by the seashore (1876), St Raphael & Fejus, Children from Foreign Parts, Child with a large leaf (Ernst Alfred), Girl with a red cap (1877) and Girl with a Lizard (1876‚Äì84). This last appears as the work of the non-existent Ren√© Dalmann in Bernard Schlink's novel series Liebesfluchten. St√ºckelberg had begun what is perhaps his seminal work in 1875, The 1356 Basel Earthquake in three drafts, which he wished not just to be a historical portrayal of a catastrophic event but to discover the \\"soul\\" of the event, with a dead child held up to heaven in agony. It took St√ºckelberg ten years till 1885 to complete this work. The influence of Jacob Burckhardt Jacob Burckhardt, professor of Art History in Basel, who had taken it upon himself to guide the career of St√ºckelberg, persuaded him to produce a monumental \\"untransportable\\" tableau, titled The Awakening of Art in the Renaissance, which adorned the staircase of the Basel Kunsthalle for an exhibition in 1877. This needs two earlier paintings, The Black death in Basel in 1349 and The Renaissance in Basel (1874) to explain its symbolism. Burckhardt saw St√ºckelberg as the painter, who, despite the political restoration of 1815 having failed to halt the dynamics of revolutionary change, looks for a higher world of beauty and harmony.Lionel Gossman, Basel in the age of Burckhardt: a Study in Unseasonable Ideas. Uni Chicago Press 2000, p.404-5 Frescoes on the Tellskapelle The Leap, from the Tellskapelle In the same year, St√ºckelberg beat Joseph Balmer to win an open competition to re-decorate the Tellskapelle on the Lake of Four Cantons, which had fallen into disrepair, a prize worth CHF 50,000. The Tellskapelle had gained as much significance to the Swiss as the Sainte-Chapelle to the French, and a stone of the old chapel had been transported to the US to be embedded in the Capitol, as symbolic for the fight for independence. For inspiration, St√ºckelberg travelled alone like a whirlwind through Milan, Bergamo, Brescia, Verona, Vicenza, Treviso, Padua, Venice, Parma, and Bologna. He wrote enthusiastically to his wife of the magnificent art he had seen, but realized on his return that the frescoes must depict true rural Swiss characters on Swiss soil in a Swiss context. So, despite the birth of his lastborn, H√©l√®ne, in April 1878, he moved to B√ºrglen in the rural Canton of Uri and painted 59 portraits of locals he would use for the chapel. These and several members of his family appear in four scenes, 'The Swearing on the R√ºtli', 'The Apple Shot', 'The Leap from the Boat', and 'Gessler's Death', based on Schiller's play, recounting the saga of Wilhelm Tell, an original freedom fighter for Swiss Independence. This story, and its remembrance, have as large significance for the Swiss as the Declaration of Independence has for Americans. Thus, as painter of these memorable events, St√ºckelberg carried a heavy responsibility, and gained consummate celebrity. Nonetheless, the whole project was threatened with cancellation when the cantons initially opposed a design which showed Walter Furst, the Uri Cantonal leader, with right hand outstretched towards heaven in priest-like mode, and the other two younger leaders, Arnold von Melchtal of Unterwalden and Werner Stauffacher of Schwyz, kneeling before him touching the sword in his left hand. After some acrimonious argument, mainly relating to costs, St√ºckelberg relented and re- drew the fresco to the satisfaction of the Uri politicians, with the three leaders standing (as traditionally symbolized) despite his artistic reservations. The works were unveiled in June 1883 and are open gratis to the public, visitable by boat, at least one of which, by Uri law, must halt per year at the Tellskapelle. For his efforts, St√ºckelberg gained a Doctorate honoris causa from the University of Zurich in 1883, as well as many other honours. Maturity as a painter During this time, he also managed to complete a commission for Peter Conradin von Planta, which is probably his best known work, 'The last Knight of the Hohenr√§tien plunges into the Depths of the Via Mala', and hangs in the Federal Gallery of Chur. Now perhaps accustomed to \\"untransportable\\" works, he produced a mural, 'Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam' in Basel (1882), a fresco, 'Crowning of the troubadour Hadlaub' in Zurich (1883), and began several paintings, 'The Last Knight of Realt', a portrait of his mother, another of his wife, 'Supper on Manegg' (at the behest of Melchior R√∂mer, the City President of Zurich, 1885), 'Consoler of the Orphan', 'Love Garden', 'Queen Bertha', 'Autumn Song', and 'Wildenstein Castle (Bubendorf)', where he had stayed in the summer of 1886. The summer of 1887 was spent in Riggenburg and Spiringen, but in 1888, he once more went on travels to Assisi, Rome, Capri and his beloved Anticoli-Corrado. Here he was inspired to paint, virtually without halt, many landscapes and also major works demonstrating the maturity of his art, 'The Cypresses of the Villa D'Este', 'The Cliffs of Capri', 'View of Assisi' 'Violinist of Anticoli', 'A Melody of Oceans', 'The blissful ones', 'Jean de Souabe the penitent parricide', 'Pilgrim in the Abbruzzo'(1888). The following year he also painted three self-portraits. Death of his sister Sappho (1897) However, in the autumn of 1890, his sister, to whom he was very close, died, and St√ºckelberg's art retreated into a contemplative mode: he drew portraits, and only three major works in the following six years: 'Death & Life', 'The Graveyard', 'Those cut off', but these full of depth of interpretation. However, during the mid to late 1890s, he seemed to gain a new lease of enthusiasm, and produced the magnificent works: 'The Prodigal Son' (1897),'The Last Secret', 'At the Source of Parnassus', 'Myrtis & Corinna with the potter Agathon', 'Sappho', 'The Fortune-teller', 'The Sirens', 'Crusader', 'The Sermon of the fish', 'And it was all a dream', 'Joan of Arc', 'Island of the Fortune-teller' 'Fisher & Nereids' (1899) and exhibited at the World Exhibition of Paris in 1900, receiving another gold medal in Basel that year. Travelling again to the Mediterranean, he produced enchanting sketches of St- Aygulf in 1896, Agay in 1897, where he painted Guy de Maupassant in front of his villa at Juan-les-Pins, Alassio, where he painted Martha de Montalembert in her Roman Villa (1899), and the remarkable 'Herd of Sheep under the olive- trees' and 'The beach at Alassio' (1901). In addition, he painted hundreds of 'Brettchen' (oils on small wooden boards, 12 x 22 cm) such as 'Villa Mignonne, St Raphael' which he created in the place of today's camera snaps. Many of these later works were exhibited posthumously at the Athenaeum in Geneva in 1904. A local journalist then wrote, \\"These last are perhaps, for us, the best.\\" Impact of St√ºckelberg's art B√∂cklin's art, now better known, differs from that of St√ºckelberg, but as he wrote to his mother in 1863, \\"B√∂cklin paints figures, and his characters are bearers of the landscape's impact, whilst I myself paint the life of the land, the village, the town.\\" Indeed, St√ºckelberg's portrayal of real life, mixed with a dash of poetry and often of humour, marks his real genius and talent.

It was opened in August 1739 and destroyed in November 1943, with its rubble removed in 1947. View of northern Mauerstra√üe, including Trinity Church, c 1780 It was located in the Friedrichstadt district (now part of the Mitte borough), at the intersection of Mauerstra√üe, Kanonierstra√üe (now known as Glinkastra√üe) and Mohrenstra√üe at the postcode 10117 Berlin. Three domestic houses used as a vicarages were built on Glinkastra√üe/Taubenstra√üe and the two which survived World War II are still part of the parish today (Glinkastra√üe 16 and Taubenstra√üe 3.). A similar church, the 1737 B√∂hmische Bethlehems-Kirche was also nearby (Bethlehemskirchplatz). History The expansion of Berlin by Frederick William I of Prussia led to a need for new church buildings. The first stone for Trinity Church was laid in August 1737 and Titus Favre made head of works. It was designed by Christian August Naumann as a circular building with four short projections, suggesting a cross shape. Johann Julius Hecker (1707-1768), the first pastor at Trinity Church It also had a 22m diameter dome over the centre of the cross, consisting of a tiled wooden structure with an octagonal lantern that served as bell tower and internal decoration representing the Four Evangelists. The nave was initially surrounded by three galleries, with the pulpit altar, organ and a second altar on the east side. The church was inaugurated on 30 August 1739 and for around a hundred years after that was the newest Protestant church building in Berlin. Its first pastor, the teacher and theologian Julius Hecker, was appointed by Frederick William himself. During Napoleon I's occupation of Berlin the church was temporarily used as a barracks, whilst the theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher preached there from 1809 to 1834 and also confirmed the future chancellor Otto von Bismarck in the church in 1831. Interior: the typical Protestant pulpit altar, photo 1939. Schleiermacher, who had made the case for a union of the Lutheran and Calvinist congregations in Prussia, persuaded the congregation not only to join the united umbrella Evangelical Church in Prussia (est. in 1817) but to also adopt the union confession for the congregation itself, which was not required but introduced by a handful of congregations in Berlin.\\"Erkl√§rung zur theologischen Grundbestimmung der Evangelischen Kirche der Union (EKU)\\" (decided on the seventh synod of the Evangelical Church of the Union 19‚Äì21 April 1991), in: ¬´‚Ä¶ den gro√üen Zwecken des Christenthums gem√§√ü¬ª Die Evangelische Kirche der Union 1817 bis 1992: Eine Handreichung f√ºr die Gemeinden, Church chancery of the Evangelical Church of the Union (ed.) on behalf of the Synod, Bielefeld: Luther-Verlag, 1992, pp. 38‚Äì49, here p. 47. . The baroque rectory in Taubenstra√üe / Glinkastra√üe. The upper gallery was rebuilt by the architect Adolf Lohse in 1864. Ernst Hermann von Dryander (1843-1922) was the church's pastor from 1882 to 1898, during which time a baptistery and a new vestry porch were added to plans by the architects Carl Vohl and Friedrich Schulze between 1885 and 1886. Paul von Hindenburg went to Sunday service at the church, whilst Dietrich Bonhoeffer preached at university services there during his time as lecturer and chaplain at the TU Berlin from 1932 to 1933. It was destroyed by bombing in November 1943 and its ruins were then used as a Nazi Party bunker before being demolished in 1947.

Prince Albert of Prussia (1809‚Äì1872) in 1853 had secondly married Rosalie von Rauch, Countess of Hohenau (1820‚Äì1879); due to this morganatic marriage he was forced to leave the Prussian court and had to look for a new home abroad. He commissioned his chamberlain's wife, Baroness of Stockhausen to find an adequate domicile. She turned to the Saxon capital and acquired the area ‚ÄúFindlater's Vineyard‚Äù, including the manor and gardens, by order of the Prince for 16,000 Thalers. Adolf Lohse, a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel, designed the plans for the present-day castle. For the gardens, the Prince engaged the Prussian landscape architect Eduard Neide (1818‚Äì1883) who created the plan, though the court gardener Hermann Sigismund Neumann (1829‚Äì1880) accomplished them. Before Albrechtsberg, the adjacent Villa Stockhausen was completed. The villa was originally established for the chamberlain, but was used for the first year as domicile of the Prince and his wife. 1854 the castle was accomplished and the couple moved in. After Prince Albrecht and Rosalie had died, their younger son Count Frederick of Hohenau (1857‚Äì1914) lived in the castle until his death, whereafter his elder brother Wilhelm (1854‚Äì1930) took over the residence. In 1925 Wilhelm finally had to sell the castle and the territory because of gambling debts. The new owner was the City of Dresden. After 1930, the gardens were opened for the public and redesigned as a recreational area for the citizens of Dresden under Mayor Wilhelm K√ºlz. Albrechtsberg Pioneer Palace, 1953 During World War II the premises were used by the SA, whilst from 1943 the castle was used as a children‚Äôs home. All the three Elbe castles were spared from the bombing of Dresden, however occupied by the Red Army, with depredations and damages as the consequences. In 1948 the City of Dresden had to sell the castle to the Foreign Economic Trade Ministry of the Soviet Union. The castle was renovated by the architect Koeckritz. After the redecoration the castle was opened as a hotel called ‚ÄúIntourist.‚Äù In 1951, the East German Jugendheim GmbH Berlin repurchased the castle, and since 1952 the City of Dresden is once again the owner. The building was used as a Pioneers Palace by the Ernst Th√§lmann Pioneer Organisation. In 1977 the castle was declared a historic monument. The step by step restoration continues to this day. In 1991 the ‚ÄúHotel- und Gast√§ttenschule Schloss Albrechtsberg GmbH‚Äù began operating in the castle. Today, the entire castle and grounds can be rented for special events. The operator of the castle since 1999 is the ‚ÄúKonzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden‚Äù  Architecture  Adolf Lohse designed the castle in a late Neoclassical style that was very characteristic for the mid 19th century. During the interior completion just the most high class materials were used, for example marble, the most kingly wood and the white sandstone from Saxony. Deciding for the composition was the style of the classicism. For this style, especially important is the Grecian and Roman antiquity; the Italian Renaissance and its traditionally application. The guide for the composition of the castle was the Ville d'Este close to Rome. For the creation of the park, the Prussia garden architect Eduard Neide 1818-1883 was engaged. However, the court gardener Hermann Sigismund Neumann carried them out. Under the management of the court gardener, four landscapes were created. Those were crossed by curved alleys that are go over bridges and a viaduct. These alleys passe applied ponds, rocks and a waterfall.
