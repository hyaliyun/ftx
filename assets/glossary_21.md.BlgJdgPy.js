It was published for several 8-bit formats including Amstrad CPC, MSX and ZX Spectrum. Overview The player takes control of an alien (who bears a striking resemblance to the race of aliens from the Alien series of films) aboard a huge spacecraft filled with many extraterrestrial creatures. The player must perpetuate the alien's race by finding ten pods on the ship and introducing them to the incubators. The ship itself is split into 142 areas divided into four zones. These zones are joined by doors or air-vents (which the player can crawl through). The zones also consist of different levels connected by lifts. The pods are found in large rooms which are different from the corridors and vents which make up much of the spacecraft and more closely resemble the sort of room found in 1980s platform games. Some creatures on the ship are dangerous and the player can spit paralysing acid at them. The player has a limited amount of energy which can be sapped by hostile creatures on the ship or defence systems. This energy can be replenished by managing to place a pod in an incubator or by eating one of the technicians which can be found wandering around the ship.

In contrast to the Neoclassical perfectionism of his chief rival Ingres, Delacroix took for his inspiration the art of Rubens and painters of the Venetian Renaissance, with an attendant emphasis on colour and movement rather than clarity of outline and carefully modelled form. Dramatic and romantic content characterized the central themes of his maturity, and led him not to the classical models of Greek and Roman art, but to travel in North Africa, in search of the exotic.Gombrich, E.H., The Story of Art, pages 504‚Äì6. Phaidon Press Limited, 1995. Friend and spiritual heir to Th√©odore G√©ricault, Delacroix was also inspired by Lord Byron, with whom he shared a strong identification with the \\"forces of the sublime\\", of nature in often violent action.Clark, Kenneth, Civilisation, page 313. Harper and Row, 1969. However, Delacroix was given to neither sentimentality nor bombast, and his Romanticism was that of an individualist. In the words of Baudelaire, \\"Delacroix was passionately in love with passion, but coldly determined to express passion as clearly as possible.\\"Wellington, Hubert, The Journal of Eug√®ne Delacroix, introduction, page xiv. Cornell University Press, 1980. Together with Ingres, Delacroix is considered one of the last old Masters of painting, and one of the few who was ever photographed. As a painter and muralist, Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author Walter Scott and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Early life 237x237px Eug√®ne Delacroix was born on 26 April 1798 at Charenton- Saint-Maurice in √éle-de-France, near Paris. His mother was named Victoire Oeben, the daughter of the cabinet-maker Jean-Fran√ßois Oeben. He had three much older siblings. Charles-Henri Delacroix (1779‚Äì1845) rose to the rank of General in the Napoleonic army. Henriette (1780‚Äì1827) married the diplomat Raymond de Verninac Saint-Maur (1762‚Äì1822). Henri was born six years later. He was killed at the Battle of Friedland on 14 June 1807. There are medical reasons to believe that Eug√®ne's legitimate father, Charles-Fran√ßois Delacroix, was not able to procreate at the time of Eug√®ne's conception. Talleyrand, who was a friend of the family and successor of Charles Delacroix as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and whom the adult Eug√®ne resembled in appearance and character, considered himself as his real father. Andr√© Castelot (Talleyrand ou le cynisme [Paris, Librairie Perrin, 1980]) discusses and rejects the theory, pointing out that correspondence between Charles and his wife during the pregnancy shows no sign of tension or resentment. After assuming his office as foreign minister Talleyrand, dispatched Delacroix to The Hague in the capacity of French ambassador to the then Batavian Republic. Delacroix who at the time suffered from erectile dysfunction returned to Paris in early September 1797, only to find his wife pregnant. Talleyrand went on to assist Eug√®ne in the form of numerous anonymous commissions. Throughout his career as a painter, he was protected by Talleyrand, who served successively the Restoration and king Louis-Philippe, and ultimately as ambassador of France in Great Britain, and later by Talleyrand's grandson, Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny, half-brother of Napoleon III and speaker of the French House of Commons. His legitimate father, Charles Delacroix, died in 1805, and his mother in 1814, leaving 16-year-old Eug√®ne an orphan. His early education was at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, and at the Lyc√©e Pierre Corneille in Rouen where he steeped himself in the classics and won awards for drawing. In 1815 he began his training with Pierre-Narcisse Gu√©rin in the neoclassical style of Jacques-Louis David. An early church commission, The Virgin of the Harvest (1819), displays a Raphael-esque influence, but another such commission, The Virgin of the Sacred Heart (1821), evidences a freer interpretation.Jobert, Barth√©l√©my, Delacroix, page 62. Princeton University Press, 1997. It precedes the influence of the more colourful and rich style of the Flemish Baroque painter Peter Paul Rubens, and fellow French artist Th√©odore G√©ricault, whose works marked an introduction to Romanticism in art. The impact of G√©ricault's The Raft of the Medusa was profound, and stimulated Delacroix to produce his first major painting, The Barque of Dante, which was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1822. The work caused a sensation, and was largely derided by the public and officialdom, yet was purchased by the State for the Luxembourg Galleries; the pattern of widespread opposition to his work, countered by a vigorous, enlightened support, would continue throughout his life.Wellington, page xii. Two years later he again achieved popular success for his The Massacre at Chios. Career=Chios and Missolonghi= Massacre at Chios (1824), Louvre Delacroix's painting of the massacre at Chios shows sick, dying Greek civilians about to be slaughtered by the Turks. One of several paintings he made of this contemporary event, expressed the official policy for the Greek cause in their war of independence against the Turks, war sustained by English, Russian and French governments. Delacroix was quickly recognized by the authorities as a leading painter in the new Romantic style, and the picture was bought by the state. His depiction of suffering was controversial, however, as there was no glorious event taking place, no patriots raising their swords in valour as in David's Oath of the Horatii, only a disaster. Many critics deplored the painting's despairing tone; the artist Antoine-Jean Gros called it \\"a massacre of art\\". The pathos in the depiction of an infant clutching its dead mother's breast had an especially powerful effect, although this detail was condemned as unfit for art by Delacroix's critics. A viewing of the paintings of John Constable and the watercolour sketches and art of Richard Parkes Bonnington prompted Delacroix to make extensive, freely painted changes to the sky and distant landscape.Wellington, pages xii, 16. Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi (1826), Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux Delacroix produced a second painting in support of the Greeks in their war for independence, this time referring to the capture of Missolonghi by Turkish forces in 1825.Jobert, page 127. With a restraint of palette appropriate to the allegory, Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi displays a woman in Greek costume with her breast bared, arms half-raised in an imploring gesture before the horrible scene: the suicide of the Greeks, who chose to kill themselves and destroy their city rather than surrender to the Turks. A hand is seen at the bottom, the body having been crushed by rubble. The painting serves as a monument to the people of Missolonghi and to the idea of freedom against tyrannical rule. This event interested Delacroix not only for his sympathies with the Greeks, but also because the poet Byron, whom Delacroix greatly admired, had died there. =Romanticism= The Death of Sardanapalus (1827), Philadelphia Museum of Art Horse Frightened by a Storm, watercolour, 1824 A trip to England in 1825 included visits to Thomas Lawrence and Richard Parkes Bonington, and the colour and handling of English painting provided impetus for his only full- length portrait, the elegant Portrait of Louis-Auguste Schwiter (1826‚Äì30). At roughly the same time, Delacroix was creating romantic works of numerous themes, many of which would continue to interest him for over thirty years. By 1825, he was producing lithographs illustrating Shakespeare, and soon thereafter lithographs and paintings from Goethe's Faust. Paintings such as The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan (1826), and Woman with Parrot (1827), introduced subjects of violence and sensuality which would prove to be recurrent.Jobert, page 98. These various romantic strands came together in The Death of Sardanapalus (1827‚Äì28). Delacroix's painting of the death of the Assyrian king Sardanapalus shows an emotionally stirring scene alive with beautiful colours, exotic costumes and tragic events. The Death of Sardanapalus depicts the besieged king watching impassively as guards carry out his orders to kill his servants, concubines and animals. The literary source is a play by Byron, although the play does not specifically mention any massacre of concubines. Sardanapalus' attitude of calm detachment is a familiar pose in Romantic imagery in this period in Europe. The painting, which was not exhibited again for many years afterward, has been regarded by some critics as a gruesome fantasy involving death and lust. Especially shocking is the struggle of a nude woman whose throat is about to be cut, a scene placed prominently in the foreground for maximum impact. However, the sensuous beauty and exotic colours of the composition make the picture appear pleasing and shocking at the same time. A variety of Romantic interests were again synthesized in The Murder of the Bishop of Li√®ge (1829). It also borrowed from a literary source, this time Scott, and depicts a scene from the Middle Ages, that of the murder of Louis de Bourbon, Bishop of Li√®ge amidst an orgy sponsored by his captor, William de la Marck. Set in an immense vaulted interior which Delacroix based on sketches of the Palais de Justice in Rouen and Westminster Hall, the drama plays out in chiaroscuro, organized around a brilliantly lit stretch of tablecloth. In 1855, a critic described the painting's vibrant handling as \\"Less finished than a painting, more finished than a sketch, The Murder of the Bishop of Li√®ge was left by the painter at that supreme moment when one more stroke of the brush would have ruined everything\\".Jobert, pages 116‚Äì18. =Liberty Leading the People= Liberty Leading the People (1830), Louvre, Paris Delacroix's most influential work came in 1830 with the painting Liberty Leading the People, which for choice of subject and technique highlights the differences between the romantic approach and the neoclassical style. Less obviously, it also differs from the Romanticism of G√©ricault, as exemplified by The Raft of the Medusa. > Delacroix felt his composition more vividly as a whole, thought of his > figures and crowds as types, and dominated them by the symbolic figure of > Republican Liberty which is one of his finest plastic > inventions...Wellington, page xv. Probably Delacroix's best-known painting, Liberty Leading the People is an unforgettable image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward under the banner of the tricolour representing liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems to be trying to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis-Philippe, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly against a background of smoke.Allard, S√©bastien, C√¥me Fabre, Dominique de Font-R√©aulx, Mich√®le Hannoosh, Mehdi Korchane, and Asher Ethan Miller (2018). Delacroix. New York, NY: Metropolitan Museum of Art. pp. 74‚Äì76. . Christ on the Sea of Galilee, 1854 Although the French government bought the painting, by 1832 officials deemed its glorification of liberty too inflammatory and removed it from public view.Allard, S√©bastien, C√¥me Fabre, Dominique de Font-R√©aulx, Mich√®le Hannoosh, Mehdi Korchane, and Asher Ethan Miller (2018). Delacroix. New York, NY: Metropolitan Museum of Art. p. 76. . Nonetheless, Delacroix still received many government commissions for murals and ceiling paintings.Allard, S√©bastien, C√¥me Fabre, Dominique de Font-R√©aulx, Mich√®le Hannoosh, Mehdi Korchane, and Asher Ethan Miller (2018). Delacroix. New York, NY: Metropolitan Museum of Art. p. 103. . Following the Revolution of 1848 that saw the end of the reign of King Louis Philippe, Delacroix' painting, Liberty Leading the People, was finally put on display by the newly elected President, Louis Napoleon (Napoleon III). It is exhibited in the Louvre museum in Paris; although from December 2012 until 2014 it was on exhibit at Louvre-Lens in Lens, Pas-de-Calais. The boy holding a pistol aloft on the right is sometimes thought to be an inspiration for the Gavroche character in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel, Les Mis√©rables.N√©ret, Gilles Delacroix, page 26. Taschen, 2000. . Retrieved 27 May 2017. Travel to North Africa Fanatics of Tangier (1838), Minneapolis Institute of Art In 1832, Delacroix traveled to Spain and North Africa in company with the diplomat Charles-Edgar de Mornay, as part of a diplomatic mission to Morocco shortly after the French conquered Algeria. He went not primarily to study art, but to escape from the civilization of Paris, in hopes of seeing a more primitive culture. He eventually produced over 100 paintings and drawings of scenes from or based on the life of the people of North Africa, and added a new and personal chapter to the interest in Orientalism.Jobert, page 140. Delacroix was entranced by the people and the costumes, and the trip would inform the subject matter of a great many of his future paintings. He believed that the North Africans, in their attire and their attitudes, provided a visual equivalent to the people of Classical Rome and Greece: > The Greeks and Romans are here at my door, in the Arabs who wrap themselves > in a white blanket and look like Cato or Brutus... Self-portrait, 1837. \\"Eug√®ne Delacroix was a curious mixture of skepticism, politeness, dandyism, willpower, cleverness, despotism, and finally, a kind of special goodness and tenderness that always accompanies genius\\".Baudelaire, quoted in Jobert, page 27. He managed to sketch some women secretly in Algiers, as in the painting Women of Algiers in their Apartment (1834), but generally he encountered difficulty in finding Muslim women to pose for him because of Muslim rules requiring that women be covered. Less problematic was the painting of Jewish women in North Africa, as subjects for the Jewish Wedding in Morocco (1837‚Äì1841). While in Tangier, Delacroix made many sketches of the people and the city, subjects to which he would return until the end of his life.Wellington, page xvi. Animals‚Äîthe embodiment of romantic passion‚Äîwere incorporated into paintings such as Arab Horses Fighting in a Stable (1860), The Lion Hunt (of which there exist many versions, painted between 1856 and 1861), and Arab Saddling his Horse (1855). Musical Inspirations Medea about to Kill Her Children, 1838 The Barque of Dante (1822), Louvre Delacroix drew inspiration from many sources over his career, such as the literary works of William Shakespeare and Lord Byron, or the artistry of Michelangelo. But from beginning to end of his life, he was in part characterized by a constant need for music, saying in 1855, \\"nothing can be compared with the emotion caused by music; that it expresses incomparable shades of feeling.\\" He had said, while working at Saint Sulpice, that the music put him in a state of \\"exaltation\\" which inspired his painting. It was often in music, in the most melancholy renditions of Chopin, or the \\"pastoral\\" works of Beethoven that Delacroix was often able to draw the most emotion and inspiration. At one point during his life, Delacroix befriended and made portraits of the composer Chopin; in his journal, Delacroix praised him frequently. Lion Hunt (1855), Nationalmuseum, Stockholm Lion Hunt (1860/61), Art Institute of Chicago Murals and later life In 1838 Delacroix exhibited Medea about to Kill Her Children, which created a sensation at the Salon. His first large-scale treatment of a scene from Greek mythology, the painting depicts Medea clutching her children, dagger drawn to slay them in vengeance for her abandonment by Jason. The three nude figures form an animated pyramid, bathed in a raking light which penetrates the grotto in which Medea has hidden. Though the painting was quickly purchased by the State, Delacroix was disappointed when it was sent to the Lille Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts; he had intended for it to hang at the Luxembourg, where it would have joined The Barque of Dante and Scenes from the Massacres of Chios.Jobert, pages 245‚Äì6. From 1833 Delacroix received numerous commissions to decorate public buildings in Paris. In that year he began work for the Salon du Roi in the Chambre des D√©put√©s, Palais Bourbon, which was not completed until 1837, and began a lifelong friendship with the female artist Marie-√âlisabeth Blavot-Boulanger. For the next ten years he painted in both the Library at the Palais Bourbon and the Library at the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1843 he decorated the Church of St. Denis du Saint Sacrement with a large Piet√†, and from 1848 to 1850 he painted the ceiling in the Galerie d'Apollon of the Louvre. From 1857 to 1861 he worked on frescoes for the Chapelle des Anges at the Church of St. Sulpice in Paris. They included \\"The Battle of Jacob with the Angel\\", \\"Saint Michael Slaying the Dragon\\", and \\"The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple\\". These commissions offered him the opportunity to compose on a large scale in an architectural setting, much as had those masters he admired, Paolo Veronese, Tintoretto, and Rubens. The work was fatiguing, and during these years he suffered from an increasingly fragile constitution. In addition to his home in Paris, from 1844 he also lived at a small cottage in Champrosay, where he found respite in the countryside. From 1834 until his death, he was faithfully cared for by his housekeeper, Jeanne-Marie le Guillou, who zealously guarded his privacy, and whose devotion prolonged his life and his ability to continue working in his later years.Wellington, pages xxvii‚Äìxxviii. In 1862 Delacroix participated in the creation of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts. His friend, the writer Th√©ophile Gautier, became chairman, with the painter Aim√© Millet acting as deputy chairman. In addition to Delacroix, the committee was composed of the painters Carrier-Belleuse and Puvis de Chavannes. Among the exhibitors were L√©on Bonnat, Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, Gustave Dor√©, and √âdouard Manet. Just after his death in 1863, the society organized a retrospective exhibition of 248 paintings and lithographs by Delacroix‚Äîand ceased to mount any further exhibitions. The winter of 1862‚Äì63 was extremely rough for Delacroix; he was suffering from a bad throat infection which seemed to get worse over the course of the season. On a trip to Champrosay, he met a friend on the train and became exhausted after having a conversation. On 1 June he returned to Paris to see his doctor. Two weeks later, on 16 June, he was getting better and returned to his house in the country. But by 15 July he was sick enough to see his doctor who said he could do nothing more for him. By then, the only food he could eat was fruit. Delacroix realized the seriousness of his condition and wrote his will, leaving a gift for each of his friends. For his trusted housekeeper, Jenny Le Guillou, he left enough money for her to live on while ordering everything in his studio to be sold. He also inserted a clause forbidding any representation of his features, \\"whether by a death-mask or by drawing or by photography. I forbid it, expressly.\\" On 13 August, Delacroix died, with Jenny by his side. He was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. His house, formerly situated along the canal of the Marne, is now near the exit of the motorway leading from Paris to central Germany.

The number and quality of the drawings, whether done for constructive purposes or to capture a spontaneous movement, underscored his explanation, \\"Colour always occupies me, but drawing preoccupies me.\\" Delacroix produced several fine self-portraits, and a number of memorable portraits which seem to have been done purely for pleasure, among which were the portrait of fellow artist Baron Schwiter, an inspired small oil of the violinist Niccol√≤ Paganini, and Portrait of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and George Sand, a double portrait of his friends, the composer Fr√©d√©ric Chopin and writer George Sand; the painting was cut after his death, but the individual portraits survive. On occasion Delacroix painted pure landscapes (The Sea at Dieppe, 1852) and still lifes (Still Life with Lobsters, 1826‚Äì27), both of which feature the virtuoso execution of his figure-based works.Jobert, page 99. He is also well known for his Journal, in which he gave eloquent expression to his thoughts on art and contemporary life.Eug√®ne Delacroix, Journal, nouvelle √©dition int√©grale √©tablie par Mich√®le Hannoosh, 2 vols., Paris, Jos√© Corti, 2009. . A generation of impressionists was inspired by Delacroix's work. Renoir and Manet made copies of his paintings, and Degas purchased the portrait of Baron Schwiter for his private collection. His painting at the church of St. Sulpice has been called the \\"finest mural painting of his time\\".Wellington, page xxiii. Contemporary Chinese artist Yue Minjun has created his own interpretation of Delacroix's painting Massacre of Chios, which retains the same name. Yue Minjun's painting was itself sold at Sotheby's for nearly $4.1 million in 2007. His pencil drawing Moorish Conversation on a Terrace was discovered as part of the Munich Art Hoard.

She is a multi-platinum and four-time Grammy Award‚Äìwinning artist. Chapman was signed to Elektra Records by Bob Krasnow in 1987. The following year she released her critically acclaimed debut album Tracy Chapman, which became a multi-platinum worldwide hit. The album earned Chapman six Grammy Award nominations, including Album of the Year, three of which she won, including Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for her single \\"Fast Car\\", and Best New Artist. Chapman released her second album Crossroads the following year, which garnered her an additional Grammy nomination. Since then, Chapman has experienced further success with six more studio albums, which include her multi-platinum fourth album New Beginning, for which she won a fourth Grammy Award, for Best Rock Song, for its lead single \\"Give Me One Reason\\". Chapman's most recent album is Our Bright Future, released in 2008. Early life Chapman was born in Cleveland, Ohio. Her parents divorced when she was four years of age. She was raised by her mother, who bought her music-loving three-year-old daughter a ukulele despite having little money. Chapman began playing the guitar and writing songs at age eight. She says that she may have been first inspired to play the guitar by the television show Hee Haw. Chapman's family received welfare. In her native Cleveland, school desegregation efforts led to racial unrest and riots; Chapman experienced frequent bullying and racially motivated assaults as a child. Raised as a Baptist, Chapman attended an Episcopal high school and was accepted into the program A Better Chance, which sponsors students at college preparatory high schools away from their home community. She graduated from Wooster School in Connecticut, then attended Tufts University, graduating with a B.A. degree in Anthropology and African studies. Career Chapman made her major-stage debut as an opening act for women's music pioneer Linda Tillery at Boston's Strand Theater on May 3, 1985. Another Tufts student, Brian Koppelman, heard Chapman playing and brought her to the attention of his father, Charles Koppelman. Koppelman, who ran SBK Publishing, signed Chapman in 1986. After Chapman graduated from Tufts in 1987, he helped her to sign a contract with Elektra Records. Chapman in Budapest, Hungary, 1988 At Elektra, she released Tracy Chapman (1988). The album was critically acclaimed, and she began touring and building a fanbase. \\"Fast Car\\" began its rise on the U.S. charts soon after she performed it at the televised Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert in June 1988; it became a number 6 pop hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for the week ending August 27, 1988. Rolling Stone ranked the song number 167 on their 2010 list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". It is the highest-ranking song on the Rolling Stone list that was both performed and solely written by a female artist. \\"Talkin' 'bout a Revolution\\", the follow-up to Fast Car, charted at number 75 and was followed by \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\", which peaked at number 48. The album sold well, going multi- platinum and winning three Grammy Awards, including an honor for Chapman as Best New Artist. Later in 1988, Chapman was a featured performer on the worldwide Amnesty International Human Rights Now! Tour. Chapman's follow-up album, Crossroads (1989), was less commercially successful than her debut had been, but it still achieved platinum status. By 1992's Matters of the Heart, Chapman was playing to a small but devoted audience. Her fourth album, New Beginning (1995), proved successful, selling over three million copies in the U.S. The album included the hit single \\"Give Me One Reason\\", which won the 1997 Grammy for Best Rock Song and became Chapman's most successful single to date, peaking at Number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following a four-year hiatus, her fifth album, Telling Stories, was released in 2000. Its hit single, \\"Telling Stories\\", received heavy airplay on European radio stations and on Adult Alternative and Hot AC stations in the United States. Chapman toured Europe and the United States in 2003 in support of her sixth album, Let It Rain (2002). To support her seventh studio album, Where You Live (2005), Chapman toured major U.S. cities in October and toured Europe over the remainder of the year. The \\"Where You Live\\" tour was extended into 2006; the 28-date European tour featured summer concerts in Germany, Italy, France, Sweden, Finland, Norway, the UK, Russia and more. On June 5, 2006, she performed at the 5th Gala of Jazz in Lincoln Center, New York, and in a session at the 2007 TED (Technology Entertainment Design) conference in Monterey, California. Chapman was commissioned by the American Conservatory Theater to compose music for its production of Athol Fugard's Blood Knot, a play on apartheid in South Africa, staged in early 2008. Atlantic Records released Chapman's eighth studio album, Our Bright Future (2008). Chapman made a 26-date solo tour of Europe. She returned to tour Europe and selected North American cities during the summer of 2009. She was backed by Joe Gore on guitars, Patrick Warren on keyboards, and Dawn Richardson on percussion.\\"2009 ‚Äì Our Bright Future Summer European + US Tour\\" , About Tracy Chapman, December 22, 2008. Chapman at a 2007 performance Chapman was appointed a member of the 2014 Sundance Film Festival U.S. Documentary jury. Chapman performed Ben E. King's \\"Stand By Me\\" on one of the final episodes of the Late Show with David Letterman in April 2015. The performance became a viral hit and was the focus of various news articles including some by Billboard and The Huffington Post. On November 20, 2015, Chapman released Greatest Hits, consisting of 18 tracks including the live version of \\"Stand by Me\\", the album is Chapman's first global compilation release. In October 2018, Chapman sued the rapper Nicki Minaj over copyright infringement, alleging that Minaj had sampled her song \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\" without permission. Chapman's lawsuit requested an injunction to prevent Minaj releasing the song \\"Sorry\\" and stated that she had \\"repeatedly denied\\" permission for \\"Baby Can I Hold You\\" to be sampled. Chapman has a policy of declining all such requests, according to the lawsuit. In September 2020, the judge ruled in favor of Minaj, stating that Minaj's experimentation with Chapman's song constitutes fair use rather than copyright infringement. Social activism Chapman is a politically and socially active musician. In a 2009 interview with American radio network NPR, she said, \\"I'm approached by lots of organizations and lots of people who want me to support their various charitable efforts in some way. And I look at those requests and I basically try to do what I can. And I have certain interests of my own, generally an interest in human rights.\\" She has performed at numerous socially aware events, and continues to do so. In 1988, she performed in London as part of a worldwide concert tour to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with Amnesty International. The same year Chapman also performed in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute, an event which raised money for South Africa's Anti-Apartheid Movement and seven children's charities. In 2004, Chapman performed (and rode) in the AIDS/LifeCycle event. Chapman has also been involved with Cleveland's elementary schools. A music video produced by Chapman that highlights significant achievements in African-American history has become an important teaching tool in Cleveland Public Schools. Chapman also agreed to sponsor a \\"Crossroads in Black History\\" essay contest for high school students in Cleveland and other cities. Chapman received an honorary doctorate from Saint Xavier University in Chicago in 1997. In 2004, Chapman was given an honorary doctorate in Fine Arts by her alma mater, Tufts University, recognizing her commitment to social activism. Chapman often performs at and attends charity events such as Make Poverty History, amfAR, and AIDS/LifeCycle, to support social causes. She identifies as a feminist. Personal life Although Chapman has never publicly disclosed her sexual orientation, writer Alice Walker has stated that she and Chapman were in a romantic relationship during the mid-1990s. Chapman maintains a strong separation between her personal and professional life.\\"2002 ‚Äì Tracy Chapman still introspective?\\" , About Tracy Chapman, October 15, 2002. \\"I have a public life that's my work life and I have my personal life,\\" she said. \\"In some ways, the decision to keep the two things separate relates to the work I do.\\" Discography ;Studio albums *Tracy Chapman (1988) *Crossroads (1989) *Matters of the Heart (1992) *New Beginning (1995) *Telling Stories (2000) *Let It Rain (2002) *Where You Live (2005) *Our Bright Future (2008) ReferencesExternal links  * *Atlantic Records page Category:1964 births Category:20th-century African- American women Category:21st-century African-American women Category:20th- century American women guitarists Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:21st-century American women guitarists Category:21st-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American women singers Category:21st-century American women singers Category:African-American female singer-songwriters Category:African-American feminists Category:African-American guitarists Category:American street performers Category:American acoustic guitarists Category:American contraltos Category:American folk guitarists Category:American folk rock musicians Category:American folk singers Category:Atlantic Records artists Category:Blues rock musicians Category:Brit Award winners Category:Elektra Records artists Category:Fast Folk artists Category:Feminist musicians Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Guitarists from Ohio Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Cleveland Category:Singers from Ohio Category:Tufts University alumni ","title":"Tracy Chapman"},{"id":"169834","text":"Context may refer to: * Context (language use), the relevant constraints of the communicative situation that influence language use, language variation, and discourse summary Computing * Context (computing), the virtual environment required to suspend a running software program * Lexical context or runtime context of a program, which determines name resolution; see Scope (computer science) * Context awareness, a complementary to location awareness * Context menu, a menu in a graphical user interface that appears upon user interaction * ConTeXt, a macro package for the TeX typesetting system * ConTEXT, a text editor for Microsoft Windows * Operational context, a temporarily defined environment of cooperation Other uses * Archaeological context, an event in time which has been preserved in the archaeological record * Opaque context, the linguistic context in which substitution of co- referential expressions does not preserve truth * Trama (mycology) (context or flesh), the mass of non-hymenial tissues that composes the mass of a fungal fruiting body See also  Contextual (disambiguation) * Contextualization (disambiguation) * Locality (disambiguation) * State (disambiguation) ","title":"Context"},{"id":"169835","text":"Ministry may refer to:  Government  * Ministry (collective executive), the complete body of government ministers under the leadership of a prime minister * Ministry (government department), a department of a government  Religion  * Christian ministry, activity by Christians to spread or express their faith ** Minister (Christianity), clergy authorized by a church or religious organization to perform teaching or rituals ** Ordination, the process by which individuals become clergy * Ministry of Jesus, activities described in the Christian gospels * Ministry (magazine), a magazine for pastors published by the Seventh-day Adventist Church  Music  * Ministry (band), an American industrial metal band * Ministry of Sound, a London nightclub and record label  Fiction  * Ministry (comics), a horror comic book created by writer- artist Lara J.

They became known in the 1980s as pioneers of the industrial music genre ‚Äì although by the early 1990s they had changed to a more disco-oriented sound ‚Äì and as a frequent target of censorship groups, including the PMRC, which objected to the band's humorous and satirical references to Satan, Jesus and sex in their song lyrics and stage shows. During the early 1990s, Thrill Kill Kult had several hits on the U.S. dance club and alternative charts. They also contributed songs to several movie soundtracks and appeared in the 1994 film The Crow. The band has continued to record and tour with a rotating lineup in addition to core members Mann and McCoy. In 2017, the band celebrated its 30th anniversary. History Nardiello and Daley met in spring 1987 while touring together with the band Ministry. Soon after, Nardiello and Daley began to conceive an art film to be called My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult ‚Äì a headline taken from a British tabloid Nardiello had noted a few years prior when he lived in London. The film was never completed, but the music they had recorded for its soundtrack appealed to Wax Trax! Records, who released the completed songs as a three- track EP. Dubbing themselves Groovie Mann (Nardiello) and Buzz McCoy (Daley), they launched My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult. When the first EP sold well, a full-length album, I See Good Spirits and I See Bad Spirits, followed in 1988. Both attracted attention from college radio stations and dancefloors, as well as religious groups who balked at the overtly occult imagery in both the music and the artwork of the releases. The group continued to stoke controversy with each subsequent release, which included a remix EP entitled Nervous Xians, and they became even more popular with release of the 12-inch single \\"Kooler Than Jesus\\". Thrill Kill Kult's second album, Confessions of a Knife..., became one of the best-selling releases on Wax Trax!, and continued to goad parental groups with song titles like \\"A Daisy Chain 4 Satan\\" and \\"Rivers of Blood, Years of Darkness\\". Along with labelmates Ministry, KMFDM, and Front 242, Thrill Kill Kult helped develop the industrial music genre, but they themselves continued to evolve, creating a sound that was not easily identified or categorized. It was electronic club music with heavy beats, reminiscent of both disco and funk, yet amplified to a sometimes abrasive level. Thrill Kill Kult reflected a shift where dance records could be ominous and aggressive, and they laced their music with riffs and references that would seem more at home in a heavy metal group. One of their most distinctive characteristics is their use of spoken-word samples lifted from B-movies and old television shows. At the onset of their career, the band's music was known as having a \\"satanic\\" theme, although used in a satirical sense. The occult element of the band has moved to the background in recent years, as they have focused more on their sleazy disco sound although still laden with satire. The 1991 album Sexplosion! marked TKK's leap toward more psychedelic house beats and their later grind house lounge sound. Later albums expanded upon these sounds and explored new directions as well, such as the 1995 Interscope release Hit & Run Holiday, which combined the Kult's signature electronic sound with a psychedelic surf rock/go-go theme reminiscent of 1960s garage rock and more modern acts like The B-52's.  Live shows  Mann and McCoy recruited Thomas Thorn (a.k.a. Buck Ryder) to play keyboards and administer samples on the band's first tour. Brian Gillespie (a.k.a. Skip Town) from The Five and later Concussion Ensemble played a classic Slingerland Silver Sparkle drum set with sample triggers. The live act also featured female backup singers referred to as \\"The Bomb Gang Girlz\\", among the first of whom were Jacky Blaque, Rhonda Bond and Kitty Killdare. Thorn soon departed amicably from the live act to form his own band, The Electric Hellfire Club (which embraced the overtly Satanic themes that My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult had only flirted with). My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult kept adding a revolving cast of characters to their stage show that, over the years, has included No Wave chanteuse Lydia Lunch, bassist Charles Levi, guitarist William Tucker, Chris \\"Curse\\" Mackey from the bands Evil Mothers and Grim Faeries, Lady Galore from Lords of Acid (who appeared in TKK as Cherrie Blue), and a great number of artists, sound technicians, musicians, and filmmakers. Creatively, however, the core of the band has always been Mann and McCoy, both on record and in the live act. The \\"Sexplosion!\\" tour in 1991 achieved a particularly edgy reputation. In addition to its staging, which featured a bar and bartender onstage with the band, the show also featured a male/female duo known as Ten and Avaluscious White, who appeared onstage dressed in a number of different guises. At one point, Ten was dressed as Jesus strapped to a cross and featuring a large black dildo or alternately a large sausage between his legs, while Avaluscious White dress as a demon girl simulated oral sex on him. This created controversy and protest in a number of American locations, adding to the band's notoriety. In the summer of 2010, the band once again hit the road with Lords of Acid, with whom they toured on the Sextacy Ball Tour in 1995. The 2010 tour was originally titled Sextacy Ball 2, but was changed to the Sextreme Ball for legal reasons. In 2012, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult announced their 25-year anniversary tour covering over 30 dates in the USA tour featuring direct support by Left Spine Down.\\"LEFT SPINE DOWN TO SUPPORT MY LIFE WITH THE THRILL KILL KULT\\"\\"My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult celebrate 25 years with tour\\"  Record labels  Thrill Kill Kult left Wax Trax! Records after their third album, Sexplosion!, surpassed Confessions to become the biggest seller on the imprint, and major label Interscope Records took notice. TKK signed to Interscope, which re-released Sexplosion! and garnered the band their most familiar alternative radio hit, \\"Sex on Wheelz\\". Their following two albums, 13 Above the Night and Hit & Run Holiday, were recorded for Interscope until they parted with the label in 1996. The band's subsequent album, A Crime for All Seasons, was released on Red Ant Records. In 2001 the album The Reincarnation of Luna appeared on their own Sleazebox Records imprint, distributed by Invisible Records. The band released a companion piece to Luna called Golden Pillz: The Luna Remixes, as well as a live album called Elektrik Inferno. Rykodisc became the band's next and most current home after putting out the rarities compilation Dirty Little Secrets. Rykodisc eventually released My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult's entire back catalog, as well as a new \\"best-of\\" compilation, a non-stop megamix album featuring mash-ups of tracks from different eras called (Diamonds & Daggerz), and a long-unreleased project entitled Gay, Black & Married. In 2009, the band's own SleazeBox Records joined forces with Italy's Rustblade label and have together released TKK's most recent CDs Blood + Dope + Sin + Gold (2008), Death Threat (2009) and Sinister Whisperz (2011). Soundtracks Thrill Kill Kult has contributed songs to soundtracks of several movies, including Cool World (1992), Totally Fucked Up (1993), The Crow (1994), The Flintstones (1994), Showgirls (1995), The Amityville Legacy (2016) and Nemesis 5: The New Model (2018). They were used in dialog for The Doom Generation (1995) and Sexy Evil Genius (2013). They also appeared in The Crow performing in the nightclub shootout scene.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the industrial rock and electro-industrial genres. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Other members have included Dwayne Goettel (1986‚Äì1995), Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie (long-time associate, producer, and \\"unofficial\\" fourth member until 1996), Mark Walk (2003‚Äìpresent), and a number of guests, including Bill Leeb (1985‚Äì1986, under the pseudonym Wilhelm Schroeder), Al Jourgensen (1989), Danny Carey (2004), and many others. After the self-release of their first cassette in 1984, Skinny Puppy soon signed to Vancouver label Nettwerk, anchoring its early roster. From their Nettwerk debut EP Remission in 1984 to their 1992 album Last Rights, Skinny Puppy developed into an influential band with a dedicated cult following, fusing elements of industrial, funk, noise, new wave, electro, and rock music and making innovative use of sampling. Over the course of several tours of North America and Europe in this period, they became known for theatrical, horror-themed live performances and videos, drawing attention to issues such as chemical warfare and animal testing. In 1993, Skinny Puppy left Nettwerk and long-time producer Rave, signing with American Recordings and relocating to Malibu, California, where drug problems and tension between band members plagued the recording of their next album, The Process (1996). Ogre quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995, and Goettel died of a heroin overdose two months later. Key and Ogre, already active in a number of other projects, went their separate ways, reuniting for a one-off Skinny Puppy concert at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden, Germany, in 2000. Reforming Skinny Puppy in 2003 with producer Mark Walk, they released their ninth album, The Greater Wrong of the Right (2004), which was followed by the release of the albums Mythmaker (2007) and HanDover (2011). In 2013, they released their twelfth album, Weapon, which was inspired by allegations that their music had been used for torture in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. History=Formation and first releases (1982‚Äì1985)= Skinny Puppy formed in 1982 as a side project for Kevin Crompton in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Crompton was dissatisfied with the pop direction of the band he was in, Images in Vogue, and began Skinny Puppy with the intention of doing something more compelling and experimental. Images in Vogue had become a popular act in Vancouver, achieving several radio hits and opening for groups such as Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, and Roxy Music. Crompton had planned Skinny Puppy to be a side project while he continued his work in Images in Vogue; however, when Images in Vogue relocated to Toronto, Crompton made Skinny Puppy his full-time project. Crompton had already created the name for the project and recorded several songs when he asked Kevin Graham Ogilvie to join. Ogilvie had been a roommate of Images in Vogue member Gary Blair Smith and had met Crompton at a party in late 1982. To avoid the confusion of having two people named Kevin in one band, the pair created stage names, with Crompton becoming cEvin Key and Ogilvie becoming Nivek Ogre. Using Key's apartment as a makeshift studio, the duo began recording songs and in 1983 with the help of Images in Vogue recording engineer Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie (no relation to Ogre), Skinny Puppy released the EP Back & Forth. This was the beginning of a long partnership between Skinny Puppy and Rave, who would serve as their producer until 1993, and again in 1995, and was occasionally listed as a member of the band in album liner notes. Though only 35 copies were ever printed, the self-released Back & Forth drew the attention of Vancouver startup label Nettwerk, who signed the band later that year. The first live Skinny Puppy show was held at the Unovis art gallery in Vancouver in February 1984; the British group Alien Sex Fiend were among the 300 people in attendance. Ogre has said that Skinny Puppy acted as an escape for Key, who wished to distance himself from Images in Vogue: \\"He was looking for something to break out of [Images in Vogue], and maybe I was it\\". Key would continue to drum for Images in Vogue until the group relocated to Toronto in 1985. Key's concept behind Skinny Puppy came from the group's first song ever recorded, \\"K-9\\". The idea, according to Key, was to create music which explored \\"life as seen through a dog's eyes\\". Skinny Puppy also incorporated the use of \\"B-grade horror movie visuals\\", including fake blood and props, into their live performances. Key justified these \\"shock gore\\" antics with the following: > What we're presenting isn't much different from what [the audience] is > subjected to in everyday life. For example, a commercial is a very plastic > view of existence and reality. When you watch a TV show and see a world with > picture-perfect endings, all you have to do is switch the station and watch > the news. Bill Leeb contributed to several early Skinny Puppy recordings Having scored a record deal with Nettwerk and with interest surrounding the Back & Forth EP growing, Skinny Puppy was invited to Vancouver's Mushroom Studios to work on new material. It was here that the group recruited Bill Leeb to perform bass synth and backing vocals. Like Ogre and Key before him, Leeb created a stage name, Wilhelm Schroeder; \\"my real name is Wilhelm\\" said Leeb, \\"Schroeder we picked out from the guy playing the piano in the Charlie Brown cartoon\\". Skinny Puppy released their second EP, Remission in December 1984, almost a year following Back & Forth. Remission marked the first time Skinny Puppy would collaborate with artist Steven Gilmore, who created the album artwork. The EP was initially only released in vinyl, but was later given a cassette release in 1985. According to Nettwerk promoter George Maniatis, Remission \\"grabbed everybody by the you-know-whats\\" and, for Nettwerk Records, brought with it an association with industrial dance music. The EP was supported by music videos for the songs \\"Far Too Frail\\" and \\"Smothered Hope\\", the latter of which being the closest thing to a hit song any North American industrial act had achieved at the time. Skinny Puppy released its first full-length album, Bites, in 1985 and was produced by Key and Dave Ogilvie. Tom Ellard of the Australian electronic act Severed Heads lent a hand to the production of Bites, acting as a producer and performing various sampling and mixing duties. Described by Billboard magazine as \\"techno dance...a la Kraftwerk\\", Bites yielded the underground hit \\"Assimilate\\". Key and Ogre opened for Chris & Cosey on their 1985 Canadian tour as Hell 'O' Death Day; some of the material the duo had performed would appear on Bites as bonus tracks. One of these bonus tracks, a song called \\"The Centre Bullet\\", featured lyrics by Legendary Pink Dots founder Edward Ka-Spel. While Skinny Puppy had become well received by underground audiences in most major urban areas, due in part to their anti- consumerist themes and Cure-like aesthetics, not everyone was friendly to the group. Key described Skinny Puppy as the antithesis of \\"the Bruce Springsteen mentality of music\\", rejecting \\"Top 40 conformity\\". Toronto-based music journalist and DJ Greg Clow recalled Michael Williams, who was a VJ for Muchmusic, introducing him to Skinny Puppy, describing them as \\"Canada's answer to Depeche Mode\\". =Dwayne Goettel and stylistic transition (1986‚Äì1987)= In 1986, Nettwerk made a distribution deal with Capitol Records, allowing Skinny Puppy and others in Nettwerk's roster to expand their respective audiences. Capitol manager Stephen Powers stated that signing groups such as Skinny Puppy gave the company \\"a real credibility\\" with the alternative and college music scenes. Skinny Puppy also signed to Play It Again Sam, allowing the group's music to expand into Europe. It was this expansion into the European market that would help to make Skinny Puppy a \\"cash cow\\" for Nettwerk in the early years. In a 2007 interview with CraveOnline, Ogre commented on Skinny Puppy's time with Capitol, saying: > We‚Äôre so lucky to have gotten here, and if we look back on the fact that we > were on Capitol Records at a certain point, being distributed and making > these albums under budget‚Ä¶ there was one year when we were the only band on > the label to profit, when MC Hammer lost a shitload of money.

Bill Leeb left Skinny Puppy in 1986 to pursue his own musical project, Front Line Assembly. Leeb gave his reasons for leaving the group stating that his bandmates expressed different ideas from his own and that he had been interested in singing. Leeb's replacement would be quiet Alberta native Dwayne Goettel. A classically trained musician, Goettel had been in a duo named Water with vocalist Sandy Weir and had worked with the synthpop band Psyche, among others. Skinny Puppy's production values improved with the addition of Goettel, with Key remarking that \\"Dwayne brought us a whole new sense and aesthetic that we didn't have. Up to that point, we were really punk rock in our approach\\". Key continued on that \\"he [Goettel] had an incredible knowledge of equipment and at a very early stage was really the master of sampling, which had really just begun\\". Goettel's contributions to Skinny Puppy's second full-length effort, 1986's Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse, helped to propel the band towards the style of their \\"chaotic future masterworks\\". To promote the album, the band made an appearance on CBC Radio's Brave New Waves program in September 1986, and released their first single, \\"Dig It\\". A music video for \\"Dig It\\" was produced and received extensive airplay on MTV. Further promotion for the album came from a world tour with the band Severed Heads. The tour proved to be a vital learning experience for the group, having encounters with, according to Key, \\"tour managers and agents that didn't pay us\\". In 1987, the song \\"Stairs and Flowers\\" was released as a single, as was a new song titled \\"Chainsaw\\". The group attracted the attention of the Parent Music Resource Center (PMRC), which named Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse one of several albums believed to be \\"violent, sexually explicit, or condoning substance abuse\\". The album was named by Melody Maker magazine as one of the best releases of the year. Later in 1987 came Skinny Puppy's third full-length album, Cleanse Fold and Manipulate. Described as \\"a turning point, where experimentation is just beginning to gel with innovation\\", the album marks the point where the group began to explore more political themes, delving into topics such as the AIDS epidemic and the Vietnam War. A song from the album, \\"Addiction\\" was released as a single. The group later went on tour, with a performance at Toronto's Concert Hall being released on VHS in 1989 and CD in 1991 as Ain't It Dead Yet?. Also released in 1987 was Bites and Remission (through Capitol Records) and Remission & Bites (European release, through Pay It Again Sam), both compilations of Skinny Puppy's first two Nettwerk releases. =Subsequent success (1988‚Äì1989)= Skinny Puppy's live performances had become increasingly more elaborate, with Ogre interacting with an onstage crucifix and other \\"crudely constructed\\" stage props. Craig MacInnis of the Toronto Star described their new stage show as \\"neo-dadaist shock theatre\\", while Tom Lanham of the San Francisco Chronicle referred to it as \\"grotesque\\". The band continued to tour in 1988 with the European Head Trauma tour, supported by Edward Ka-Spel. Following the tour, the group returned to the studio to record what Ogre described would be the band's most critical statement regarding animal testing. A blood-soaked Ogre performing live Skinny Puppy released their fourth album, VIVIsectVI, in 1988; the album's name is a pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism (i.e. the \\"666 sect\\"). The group's primary aim with the album was to bring attention to the topic of vivisection and other issues regarding animal rights. The album's subject matter also deals with subjects such as chemical warfare, environmental waste, and disease. Lead track \\"Dogshit\\" was released as a single in 1988 under the name \\"Censor\\"; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single \\"Testure\\", which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No. 19 on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. According to Ogre, \\"Testure\\" was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their \\"anti-vivisectionist\\" message. \\"It's the only song I think they will be able to play on the radio\\", he said. \\"I hope they do play it because it's the only way we can go beyond our ranks and our loyal fans who already understand the message\\". \\"Testure\\" also featured several well-chosen samples from the film The Plague Dogs, an animated adventure about two dogs who escape from a research laboratory. Melody Maker named VIVIsectVI one of the best albums of 1988. Skinny Puppy toured in support of the album, featuring an early incarnation of the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails as their opening act.\\"The Only Time\\" lyrics , nintourhistory.com, no date. The concept for the live show revolved around a vivisectionist (played by Ogre) who is eventually transformed into a tortured animal; the idea was to portray the \\"inner workings of the mind under the strain of vivisection\\". The stage show included the mock vivisection of a stuffed dog the band had named Chud.\\"Skinny Puppy U.S. tour going to the dogs.\\" The Toronto Star, 4 November 1988. Following a show in Cincinnati, Ohio, Key, Ogre, and tour manager Dan McGee were arrested for \\"disorderly conduct\\" when an audience member, believing the stuffed animal Ogre was \\"vivisecting\\" to be a real dog, called the police.\\"Skinny Puppy Jailed for Toy Dog Operation.\\" The Toronto Star, 26 October 1988. Two plainclothes officers entered the group's dressing room demanding they inspect the prop. Following a heated argument, the trio spent the night in jail, but were released the following day after paying a $200 fine. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band members began working on various side projects. Key and Goettel were involved with The Tear Garden (a collaboration with The Legendary Pink Dots) and Doubting Thomas (an outlet for their non-Skinny Puppy instrumentals). The band Hilt, a collaboration between Key and Geottel, and Al Nelson, also started when Nettwerk challenged the group to produce an album for as little money as possible. Ogre struck up a friendship with Ministry's Al Jourgensen, having first worked together during the recording of the PTP song \\"Show Me Your Spine\\" (featured in the 1987 film RoboCop). For Skinny Puppy's fifth album, Rabies, released in 1989, Jourgensen joined Rave as producer. The album, featuring Jourgensen's electric guitar work and backing vocals, drew mixed reception from fans. Despite these reactions, the album was a commercial success, selling 150,000 copies and receiving extensive airplay on college radio. The single \\"Worlock\\" ‚Äì which featured samples of Charles Manson singing parts of the song \\"Helter Skelter\\" from The Beatles' White Album, accompanied by a fragmented portion of the songs guitar introduction ‚Äì helped to bring the band \\"massive popularity\\". A video produced for the song, featuring spliced-together footage from dozens of horror films and a statement denouncing censorship of the genre by the MPAA, was circulated widely as a promotional and bootleg item. The song \\"Tin Omen\\" was also released as a single and \\"Hexonxonx\\" received some airplay on alternative radio. In spite of the album's initial mixed reception, Brad Filicky in a 2003 issue of CMJ magazine named Rabies as a classic album, calling it \\"a masterpiece of the industrial genre\\". This period marked the beginning of divisions within the band, as rather than tour in support of Rabies, Ogre joined Ministry while they toured in support of their album The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste (1989); Ogre contributed guitars, keyboards, and vocals during the tour. Ogre had also begun working with the Ministry side project Revolting Cocks. Key was later quoted saying of Ogre's involvement with Ministry and, later on, Martin Atkins' Pigface that he sometimes felt \\"like a wife that's been cheated on\\".IndustrialnatioN No. 5, 1991. =Too Dark Park (1990‚Äì1991)= Following the production of Rabies, a divide grew between the group members, with Key and Goettel often siding against Ogre, feeling he was more interested in solo work. The group were ultimately disappointed with the outcome of Rabies, with Goettel saying that the completed product was \\"less within the Skinny Puppy vision\\", and Key being displeased with Jourgensen's involvement. Ogre also expressed his disapproval for the album, claiming that he had \\"flopped\\". \\"The work and artistic environment really weren't there at all either. It was completely negative\\". Key and Goettel completed work on some of their side projects such a Hilt, releasing their first effort, Call the Ambulance (Before I Hurt Myself), which was produced by Rave. Key also reunited with Bill Leeb to form the project known as Cyberaktif; Goettel acted as an assistant producer and provided some instrumentation. Jourgensen offered Ogre the chance to tour with the Revolting Cocks, having provided vocals on their previous tour. Ogre refused the offer, citing some occurrences during his time with Ministry which led him to question his friendship with Jourgensen. Ogre performing during the Too Dark Park tour, 1990 The group, having finished work on their various side projects, returned to the studio and released their sixth studio album, Too Dark Park, in 1990. Goettel said in a radio interview that the major intentions behind the album were to reevaluate what Skinny Puppy was and create a new style of music to mark the beginning of a new decade. This reevaluation included hiring Jim Cummins (I, Braineater) to design the cover artwork, feeling that their longtime designer Steven Gilmore had lost his creative spark. Described as \\"forceful and consistently abrasive\\", Too Dark Park was what Key referred to as the true successor to \\"the last pure\\" Skinny Puppy album, VIVIsectVI. Critics such as Staci Bonner of Spin magazine applauded the use of sampling and stated that the album was a \\"return to the bloodbath\\" for the group. The album yielded the singles \\"Tormentor\\" and \\"Spasmolytic\\", the latter of which spawned a music video directed by Jim Van Bebber. Billboard called \\"Spasmolytic\\" a \\"delicious mind-altering affair\\", a sentiment shared by Wil Lewellyn of Treblezine who included the song in a list of the best underground songs of the 1990s. Environmental degradation was a major theme on both the album and the North American Too Dark Park tour. For the tour, Key took on the role of drummer, leaving Goettel as lead keyboardist. Key told Alternative Press that \\"we could very well have a backing tape and stand behind synths playing two notes on the keyboard, but we've decided to physically strain ourselves and learn additional parts along with what we've already written\\". Onstage theatrics included a segment with Ogre performing on stucco stilts and pneumatic crutches, Ogre being hoisted from the stage by cables, and a backing film featuring scenes of graphic violence, most notably sequences from the Japanese film series Guinea Pig. Ogre later gave insight on the backing film's conception, saying: > We did an experiment ... We've always been accused of celebrating violence > for idiotic reasons. [So] we used some images in our show from a film called > Guinea Pig. They're these incredibly realistic, but simulated, Japanese > snuff films. We inserted them into this roller-coaster ride of violent > images and people were quite disgusted. People were vomiting in front of the > stage. People came up to me after the show, saying I was the most disgusting > human being-until they found out what it was all about. The whole reason we > did that was to see if there was a difference. Will people react differently > to something that's real as opposed to something they know is staged? They > will. There's a whole different set of emotions people go through. It > doesn't look like it looks on TV. It's quite sickening. Ogre, who considered the tour to be a high point in his career, compared the band's performances to something like intense car races. \\"People go there expecting an accident to happen ... I was really running off that car-crash energy\\". Following the tour, Ogre became involved with Martin Atkins' project Pigface in 1991, for a short time becoming the group's lead vocalist. Pigface included talent from several other industrial groups such as William Rieflin of Ministry and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who helped record the song \\"Suck\\". Ogre and Reznor performed the song together in the live album Welcome to Mexico... Asshole. Also on the album was a cover of the song \\"T.F.W.O.\\" from Too Dark Park, led by Ogre. In 2003, Alexander Chow of Spin magazine named Too Dark Park an essential industrial album, stating that \\"schizophrenic beats, manic-depressive mumblings, and just the right dose of fist-raising choruses\\" made for a dance floor favorite. =Last Rights (1992)= Following Too Dark Park, Skinny Puppy was commissioned by the dance group La La La Human Steps to compose several songs for their 1991 production Infante C'est Destroy, a duty shared alongside the likes of Einst√ºrzende Neubauten. It was also during this time that Ogre made a concerted effort to rid his drug addictions. In an interview with CITR-FM, Ogre discussed his ordeals with hepatitis A and subsequent hospilization; he also thanked Pigface for looking after him during his \\"hour of need\\". Pigface: Nivek Ogre (center) with Chris Connelly (left) and Martin Atkins Skinny Puppy released their seventh studio album, Last Rights, in 1992. It was the last album the band released under Nettwerk/Capitol. Relationships between the band members during the album's production were \\"tense and unhealthy\\", with Ogre, under the supervision of Rave, coming into the studio at night to perform vocals for the music Key and Goettel composed earlier in the day. Ogre said that the production of Last Rights acted as a form of therapy which he used to help him come to terms with his addictions. \\"It's painful for me to be reminded of certain things, but for me to say it never happened is wrong. I'll be glad to put it behind me, but I had to do this\\". Described by Entertainment Weekly as a \\"nonstop stretch of horrific soundscapes\\", Last Rights became the first Skinny Puppy record to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 193. The album remained on Billboard's Heatseekers album chart for several weeks, peaking at No. 10. The track \\"Inquisition\\" was released as a single and included several alternative cuts of the song, as well as the b-side \\"LaHuman8\\" (one of the tracks produced for La La La Human Steps). A second single, \\"Love in Vein\\", was never released, although an unfinished remix intended for it later appeared on Brap: Back and Forth Series 3 & 4 in 1996. A music video for the song \\"Killing Game\\", which featured a student dance troupe performing in \\"high-contrast black and white\\". A track titled \\"Left Handshake\\" was excluded from Last Rights, leaving a blank track 10 on some copies of the album. Clearance for a lengthy vocal sample from Timothy Leary's Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out, was approved by Leary, but denied by the copyright holder, Henry G. Saperstein. Commenting on the ordeal, Key said, \\"We tried to convince him, but he [Saperstein] said, 'it doesn't matter what Leary said, he doesn't own his own work'\\". The song, in which Ogre provides commentary to Leary's instructions for avoiding a \\"bad trip\\", was eventually released on the initial European edition of Brap: Back and Forth Series 3 & 4 in 1996, and on a limited edition single called \\"Track 10\\" sold at the Skinny Puppy reunion concert in 2000 at Dresden. The stage show for the Last Rights tour in North America, much like the album itself, was built around a detailed narrative inspired by Ogre's past ordeals with drug abuse. The show involved Ogre interacting with a backing film by way of a virtual reality machine, a tree made of human heads and fetuses, and numerous other props and costumes. For this tour, Key once more focused exclusively on live drumming, leaving Goettel on keyboard duty. One incident that occurred at a show in Boston involved several concert goers climbing on stage and grabbing at Ogre's various masks and props, several of which were stolen. The band's manager, Tim Gore, pursued the thieves but was punched by a security guard. Following the punch, Gore began having issues breathing and was taken to a hospital; the guard was fired as a result of the incident. =The Process, Goettel's death and breakup (1993‚Äì1999)= In 1993, Skinny Puppy contributed the song \\"Ode to Groovy\\" to the compilation album In Defense of Animals, released through Restless Records. The album was named after the animal rights group of the same name. Though the track is credited to Skinny Puppy, Ogre and Rave were the only people to work on it. Ogre, Key, and Goettel signed a contract with American Recordings and moved to Malibu, California to record The Process, a concept album inspired by 1960s cult The Process Church of The Final Judgment, with Roli Mosimann producing. The recording sessions were beset by everything from fires and floods, to the Northridge earthquake. Mosimann was eventually replaced with Martin Atkins. Atkins' presence exacerbated the rift that was forming between Ogre and the rest of the band. The band's bickering and excessive drug use made the recording process so long and costly that American reduced Skinny Puppy's contract from three albums to one. In 1994, Key and Goettel returned to Vancouver with the master tapes, but Ogre remained in Los Angeles and quit Skinny Puppy in June 1995. Goettel was found dead of a heroin overdose in his parents' home two months later. The Process was eventually completed with Rave and released in 1996. It was dedicated to the memory of Goettel. It was an overall stylistic departure from their previous albums, prominently featuring untreated vocals, guitar, and more accessible song structures. The liner notes that accompanied the CD included thank-yous to \\"Electronic Music Lovers\\" and \\"Puppy People\\", followed by the words \\"The End\\" in bold type. The album charted on the Billboard 200 at No. 102 and reached the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Heatseekers album chart. During the Process era, a loose-knit art/philosophy collective also known as The Process was formed, with early contributions from Ogre and Genesis P-Orridge, among others.Farber, Philip H., Interview with Ogre , Paradigm Shift, October 1998, Vol. 1, No. 2 P-Orridge and Chris Carter, among others, jammed with Skinny Puppy during this period, a recording of which was eventually released as Puppy Gristle on a limited basis in 2002. The creation of the Download project, which Key and Goettel formed with Mark Spybey and Phil Western, also occurred at this time. Download explored everything from electronic improvisation with spoken vocals to techno, and toured in 1996. Earlier, in 1993, Goettel and Western had issued a breakbeat hardcore single (under the name aDuck) on their own label, Subconscious Records. After Goettel's death, Subconscious evolved into a recording studio and record label imprint that Key used to release a number of his own and Skinny Puppy's recordings. Key also continued to work with The Tear Garden, produced industrial/trance music with Western in the side project platEAU, and released his first solo album in 1998. Ogre had toured extensively with Martin Atkins' industrial supergroup Pigface since 1991, and toured with them again after leaving Skinny Puppy. He recorded material for his side project WELT. with Ruby's Mark Walk before quitting Skinny Puppy, but due to legal issues with American Recordings, this would not see release until 2001 under the new name, ohGr. In the meantime, he toured with KMFDM, and released an album with Martin Atkins under the name Rx (also known as Ritalin). The ohGr and Rx releases included some of Ogre's most positive and forward-thinking songwriting to date. Several collections were released while Skinny Puppy was dormant, including Brap: Back and Forth Series 3 & 4 in 1996, and The Singles Collect and B-Sides Collect in 1999. Nettwerk commissioned a remix album in 1998; titled remix dystemper, it featured various Skinny Puppy tracks re-worked by artists including Autechre, Deftones, and Guru. Ogre and Walk also took part, contributing a remix of \\"Dig It\\" and an updated version of Remissions \\"Smothered Hope\\" with new vocals by Ogre. In 1999, \\"Draining Faces\\" appeared on the soundtrack for The Blair Witch Project. =Reunion, The Greater Wrong of the Right and Mythmaker (2000‚Äì2008)= In August 2000, at the insistence of German promoters, Ogre and Key reunited and performed live as Skinny Puppy for the first time since 1992 at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden. The show was meant to be a continuation of the Last Rights tour, with the stage design taking influence from those performances. Rather than find a replacement for Goettel, the band simply left the keyboard station on stage empty. The performance was filmed and recorded, and a live album, Doomsday: Back and Forth Series 5: Live in Dresden, was released in 2001; a DVD release was planned but canceled by Nettwerk. Live clips of \\"Testure\\" and \\"Worlock\\" as well as a behind the scenes interview with the band were broadcast on Crazy Clip TV in Germany and \\"Worlock\\" was included on a VCD compilation by German magazine Sonic Seducer in 2002. Key joined ohGr on drums for its 2001 tour, while Ogre appeared on the track \\"Frozen Sky\\" on Key's 2001 album The Ghost of Each Room. When asked by Terrorizer magazine about the future of Skinny Puppy, Key responded: > Our goals for the future are to combine everything, take the best of what we > can do with Ogre, and the best of what we have from our past, as well as the > future stuff that we can do, and put it into one touring situation which I'm > sure will stroll back into bloodville. Skinny Puppy performing live at the London Astoria in 2005 The first new Skinny Puppy track in several years, \\"Optimissed\\", appeared on the Underworld soundtrack in 2003. Ogre, Key, Mark Walk and various guests, including Danny Carey of Tool and Wayne Static of Static-X, recorded the band's ninth studio album, The Greater Wrong of the Right, released in 2004 on Synthetic Symphony, a sub-label of SPV. The album, described by Key as being based in \\"pseudopop\\", received generally favorable reviews from critics and landed on several Billboard charts. A music video was made for the song \\"Pro-Test\\" which featured a style unlike many of the group's previous work, so much so that some were unsure if it was an official video. Skinny Puppy toured North America and Europe in support of the album in 2004, joined by William Morrison on guitar and Justin Bennett on drums. Shows in Toronto and Montreal were filmed for the live DVD Greater Wrong of the Right Live, which was released in September 2005. The DVD included Information Warfare, a documentary made by Morrison about the U.S.-led wars in Iraq. The anti-Bush administration stance taken by the band at their live shows drew the ire of PABAAH (Patriotic Americans Boycotting Anti-American Hollywood), which attempted a boycott of college radio stations that played Skinny Puppy. Skinny Puppy toured Europe again in 2005, and returned to the studio to complete their next album, Mythmaker, which was released in January 2007. The album reached No. 4 on the Independent Albums Chart, No. 5 on the Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, and No. 17 on the Heatseekers Chart, but barely broke the Billboard 200. The band's 2007 North American and European tour, titled Mythrus, began in May 2007. While some fans longed for the sounds of their earlier days, Ogre, speaking with Electronic Musician, stated the band's intention was to move forward rather than dwell in the past. \\"Some people think that the stuff we do now is a pale imitation of the past. All of the older stuff had a time and place, and we decided to move forward to where we are now\\". =In Solvent See tour and HanDover (2009‚Äì2012)= According to a news posting on the official Skinny Puppy website, the band's next studio album was originally slated for release in October 2009, but the release of this album was delayed due to insolvency issues with the SPV label (thus leading to Ogre naming the 2009 tour the \\"In Solvent See\\" tour). These issues were not expected to be resolved until the end of 2009. However, the \\"In Solvent See\\" Tour took place as planned, and began on 30 October. In October 2010, there were reports that the new Skinny Puppy album would be released in February 2011. In May 2011, Skinny Puppy announced that they finished recording a new album titled HanDover, and that they were soliciting it to other record labels for a September 2011 release date. On 27 August 2011, HanDover was officially confirmed as having an 25 October 2011, release in the United States and an 28 October 2011, release in Europe. Steven R Gilmore created the artwork for the album once again. The album landed on a number of Billboard charts, including a spot at No. 168 on the Billboard 200 and No. 9 on the Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart. Skinny Puppy were scheduled to perform at numerous European festivals in the summer of 2010, including the Amphi Festival in Germany, the 2010 Waregem Gothic Festival in Belgium, and the Recession Festival in Denmark. A live album, titled Bootlegged, Broke and in Solvent Seas and recorded on the band's 2010 European tour, was released on 12 June 2012. =Weapon and subsequent tours (2013‚Äìpresent)= Skinny Puppy during the Live Shapes for Arms tour Skinny Puppy announced that a new album, entitled Weapon, would be released on 28 May 2013. The album was inspired by news brought to the band by a former guard at Guantanamo Bay that their music had been used to torture inmates. Inspiration also came from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and from Ogre's personal views on the human species; in an interview with Vice, Ogre stated that he \\"view[s] the human being primarily as a weapon, and a lot of the things that we‚Äôve created have had disastrous effects on us as a species\\". The album was released to generally favorable reviews from critics, several noting the 1980s-esque musical style, and included a re-hashed version of the Remission- era track \\"Solvent\\". Key told the Phoenix New Times that the band had been dissatisfied with HanDovers production schedule, noting that it had taken them several years to produce the album. For Weapon, they made a return to the fast-paced, one-song-a-day style of their early years. The decision to remake the song \\"Solvent\\" helped to set the album's quickened pace; Key said that the music they were making for the album wouldn't sound correct \\"If it didn't sound like something we had just made quickly, like in the old days\\". At Primavera Sound, 2017 The band released a music video for the song \\"Illisit\\" and in October 2013, announced their Live Shape For Arms Tour, a North American tour starting in January 2014 at The Observatory in Santa Ana, CA. In early 2014, Ogre and Key sent an invoice of $666,000 to the US government for the use of their music at Guantanamo Bay, bringing the issue to the attention of mainstream media outlets. Later in 2014, the Alliance of Sound tour was announced, with performances by Skinny Puppy, VNV Nation, Haujobb, and Youth Code. However, in early November, Front Line Assembly replaced VNV Nation and the tour was renamed Eye vs. Spy, which was a 17-city North American tour between 28 November to 20 December 2014. In June 2015, Skinny Puppy performed at the Amnesia Rockfest in Montebello, Canada, alongside acts such as Ministry and The Dillinger Escape Plan. Following two successful tours with Weapon, the band yet again embarked with Youth Code, this time to play shows across North America in 2015 and across Europe in 2017 under the Down the SocioPath tour, which dropped all Weapon tracks and instead introduced many songs from the band's 1996 album, The Process, which had not been accompanied by any live performances due to the death of Goettel in 1995. Unlike the previous tours for Weapon, Down the SocioPath scaled back the theatrics and introduced Matthew Setzer as a live guitarist. Ogre began these concerts in a white hooded robe which was removed to reveal a suit into which a stagehand inserted oversized needles. The Down the Sociopath Too Euro 2017 leg lasted from 30 May to 16 June 2017. The tour included stops at the Download Festival in France, Primavera Sound, and Wave-Gotik-Treffen. Style=Sound= Inspired by the music of Suicide, Cabaret Voltaire, Chrome, Throbbing Gristle, Nocturnal Emissions, Portion Control, and The Legendary Pink Dots, music which had been accessible to the band primarily via tape exchange,Alan Di Perna. \\"Industrial Revolution: Jackhammer of the Gods\\". Guitar World, June 1995. Skinny Puppy experimented with analog and digital recording techniques, composing multi- layered music with synthesizers, drum machines, acoustic percussion, tape loops, samplers, and conventional rock music instruments to create what they called \\"audio sculpture\\". Their extensive use of sampling from horror films and radio broadcasts served to \\"clarify or obscure\\" song meanings, and they applied liberal amounts of distortion and other effects to Ogre's vocals, which are often delivered as a stream of consciousness. Lyrics commonly reference social and political subjects including animal rights, environmental degradation, drug addiction, suicide, war, privacy, and self-determination. They have also used their music to draw attention to events such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the AIDS epidemic, and the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Skinny Puppy's often informal, improvisational approach to musical composition is indicated by use of the term \\"brap\\", coined by them and defined as a verb meaning \\"to get together, hook up electronic instruments, get high, and record\\".Horn et al. (2017): p. 409 Initially a dark synth-pop group, Skinny Puppy took on a more industrial sound following the inclusion of Dwayne Goettel in 1986, and later came to be recognized as pioneers of the electro-industrial genre. Their music has been described as encompassing a range styles including ambient music, avant-funk, noise rock and industrial metal. The music that followed Goettel's death has been likened to genres such as glitch and intelligent dance music. The Village Voice described Skinny Puppy's early work as \\"dark electro-pop\\", while Billboard's Bill Coleman thought of them as a \\"moody techno-outfit\\" with an \\"aggravating\\" musical delivery. People magazine called Ogre's vocals \\"incomprehensible\\", and likened the group's use of sampling to noises heard on \\"a TV set in an adjoining hotel room\\". AllMusic referred to Skinny Puppy's music as \\"primal\\" and \\"Kraftwerk gone netherworld\\", going on to say that unlike the bands that followed in their wake, \\"Ogre and Key knew how to craft tunes and marry them to the most ingenious of sound patterns\\". Ogre told the Windsor Star in 1986 that \\"in some sense our music, or the feeling expressed by our music, is felt by a lot more people\\" than had been anticipated. Ogre said in an interview with Auxiliary Magazine in June 2013, \\"there is a very military side to Industrial music, and we are far more in the psychedelic side.\\" =Music videos= Due to their graphic nature, the majority of Skinny Puppy's videos received limited commercial airplay, or were outright banned from broadcast. The music video for \\"Stairs and Flowers\\" was banned by the Canadian Censorship Bureau because of scenes depicting \\"an excrement-covered woman being beaten by soldiers\\"; the woman in question was Ogre soaked in mud. The letterbox effect used in the video for \\"Dig It\\", which portrayed stock market footage, was accused by both the bureau and MuchMusic to instead be showing pornography. Also banned was the video for \\"Testure\\", an action resulting from a viewer poll held by CityTV, as was the video for the song \\"Worlock\\", which was banned from MTV. Ogre, a self-described horror fan, defended the \\"Worlock\\" video by saying \\"I knew there was no way they'd play 'Worlock' there [the United States]. But I went out to make that video so no one would play it!\\"; he affirmed that the video was meant to draw attention to censorship in horror films. Some of the band's videos have received airplay, such as those for the promotional songs \\"Killing Game\\" and \\"Pro-test\\"; \\"Dig It\\" was also regularly played on MTV. A 30-second television promo was produced for the band by Capital Records in 1987, featuring a mix of scenes from the \\"Stairs and Flowers\\" and \\"Dig It\\" videos. In a 1990 radio interview, Goettel explained the group's outlook on music videos, stating that \\"it's great to do videos when you have the money to do them, but for Skinny Puppy's part it's less of a promotional tool\\". He said that touring and word of mouth were their preferred avenues of promotion. \\"When a video gets made its not like 'OK we're going to spend $50,000 and it's going to sell this many more records'... it doesn't sell any more records\\". =Live performances= Skinny Puppy is noted for theatrical and controversial live performances which blend performance art with music. Ogre has been critical of the band's early performances, telling Spin magazine in 1992 that \\"I would do things on stage that would blow ‚Äì they just wouldn't work\\". Live performances involved periods of musical improvisation, film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines, many of which are designed and built by Ogre himself. While discussing Skinny Puppy's performances, Ogre remarked that \\"our shows combine images with theater. It works better than just coming out and doing a horror magic routine\\". He explained to the Vancouver Sun in 1988 that he wanted his act to have \\"that grey area where anything could happen ‚Äì where I can cut my head off by accident and people will go, 'wow, that's great'\\". Nivek Ogre and cEvin Key performing live in 2014 On-stage theatrics have included Ogre being suspended from racks and cables, play with a hangman's noose, use of an angle grinder, and mock executions of Ogre and George H.W. Bush. Following the 2004 United States presidential election, promoters began to ask the band to refrain from using fake blood during their performances. This reaction was prompted by the performance of a mock execution on stage, during which Ogre was \\"decapitated\\" by actors dressed as then U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The band was also asked by Samsung (who had been asked by Ogre to sponsor the band with a large flat screen) to \\"not insult the president\\" while performing on stage. In a 1987 television interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, Key explained that while Ogre follows a \\"rough guideline\\" during a live performance, a majority of his on-stage theatrics are conceived spontaneously. Key told Champniss that Ogre's demeanor on stage could \\"range from just a sort of laid back kind of lurking to a rampant psycho\\". Ogre once remarked that touring was, for himself, like \\"dating hydrogen peroxide\\", referencing the numerous injuries which he would acquire over the course of touring. Though Ogre and Key have remained the only constant members of Skinny Puppy's live act since Goettel's death, the pair have hired various other musicians to assist them onstage. They include drummer Justin Bennett, guitarist William Morrison, and guitarist Matthew Setzer. Influence and legacy Despite little mainstream airplay, several Skinny Puppy releases have charted in North America and Europe, and their influence on industrial and electronic music is considerable. Widely considered originators of a unique sound and live performance style, Skinny Puppy are also known as pioneers of the industrial rock and electro-industrial genres. They were one of the earliest groups to help popularize industrial music, and the Los Angeles Times recognized Ogre as the \\"first industrial rock star\\". Their gloomy and androgynous aesthetic helped attract the attention of the goth scene, from which they were able to draw a larger female audience than any previous industrial group. By the end of the 90s, they had sold some two million records for Nettwerk worldwide, and two of their releases, Remission and Bites, were certified gold in Canada. Their music has spawned \\"a litter of like-minded bands\\", extending from independent acts like Tin Omen, to industrial rock project Nine Inch Nails, who opened for Skinny Puppy for a short time on their 1988 VIVIsectVI tour. Trent Reznor also acknowledged that Skinny Puppy's \\"Dig It\\" inspired the very first Nine Inch Nails track written, \\"Down in It\\". Canadian synth-pop artist Grimes includes Skinny Puppy as an influence on her music, having grown up in Vancouver's industrial music scene. Sara Taylor of the EBM group Youth Code has said that the song \\"Worlock\\" was \\"one of the most influential songs\\" she had ever heard. Other artists impacted by Skinny Puppy's music include Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington, Moby, Jonathan Davis, Daron Malakian, 3Teeth, Foals vocalist Yannis Philippakis, Al Jourgensen, Chris Vrenna, John Grant, Mortiis,Blush Response, Celldweller, Finite Automata, Shooter Jennings, Death Grips vocalist MC Ride, X Marks the Pedwalk, Wumpscut, Haujobb, Orgy, Filter, Front Line Assembly, Orphx, Crystal Castles, AFI side project Blaqk Audio, and Mayhem vocalist Attila Csihar. The band inspired a tribute album, Hymns of the Worlock: A Tribute to Skinny Puppy published by Cleopatra Records, which features groups such as Crocodile Shop and The Electric Hellfire Club. Skinny Puppy's remix album Remix dystemper includes contributions from a wide array of musicians such as electronic music DJ Josh Wink, Guru, KMFDM, Deftones, and former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna. Vrenna's solo project, Tweaker, opened for Skinny Puppy during their 2004 North American tour. Danny Carey from Tool and Wayne Static of Static-X provided drums and backup vocals, respectively, for the song \\"Use Less\\" from The Greater Wrong of the Right. Ogre worked with KMFDM on several occasions, touring with them in 1997 and providing vocals on the song \\"Torture\\" from their album Symbols (the song also features production from Dave Ogilvie) as well as for the songs \\"That's All\\" and \\"Full Worm Garden\\" from 1999's Adios. Skinny Puppy also provided a remix for the M√∂tley Cr√ºe song \\"Hooligan's Holiday\\"; Nikki Sixx reported that the band \\"just dumped the whole song in the computer and went off\\". Skinny Puppy's music has been included in the soundtracks of films such as Bad Influence, An American Werewolf in Paris, The Blair Witch Project, Underworld, and Saw II, among others. The group was given a brief role as the \\"gang of goons\\" in the 1995 dark comedy film The Doom Generation. The 1996 Video Game Descent II included original music from Ogre and Mark Walk, while the 2014 PlayStation exclusive LittleBigPlanet 3 featured the song \\"Rodent\\" from the album Rabies. While discussing the possibility of Nine Inch Nails being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Richard Patrick of the band Filter remarked \\"what about Skinny Puppy?\\", going on to say that while Nine Inch Nails is the more famous of the two, Skinny Puppy were one of the first groups to craft \\"scary and mean\\" industrial music. Side projects ohGr performing live in Chicago, 2008 Key and Ogre are active in a number of other projects besides Skinny Puppy. Key has released several solo albums including Music for Cats and The Ghost of Each Room in 1998 and 2001, respectively. Doubting Thomas, a project led by Key and the late Dwayne Goettel, was an outlet for mostly instrumental compositions (save for several film and television samples). The projects only releases were Father Don't Cry in 1990 and The Infidel in 1991, both released through Wax Trax! Records. Download was founded by Key and Goettel in 1995 and included the assistance of frequent Skinny Puppy contributors Ken Marshall and Anthony Valcic. The group has released a number of records since its formation and notably provided the soundtrack album Charlie's Family in 1997 for the film The Manson Family, directed by Jim Van Bebber; the film was released six years after the album. Bebber had approached Key to produce the soundtrack, having previously directed several Skinny Puppy videos as well as the short horror film Chunk Blower, which starred Goettel and Bill Leeb of Front Line Assembly. Other notable projects include The Tear Garden with Edward Ka-Spel for The Legendary Pink Dots, platEAU with Phil Western, and Cyberaktif with Goettel and Leeb. Key also works as Scaremeister, his film scoring alter ego, having previously contributed to John Debney's score for End of Days. Scaremeister composed the album 31 Spirits, a collection of short musical pieces which have been used in the trailers of numerous films such as Inglourious Basterds, My Bloody Valentine, and The Book of Eli. Ogre's main project outside Skinny Puppy is ohGr, which has released five albums, Welt (2001), SunnyPsyOp (2003), Devils in my Details (2008), UnDeveloped (2011), and TrickS (2018). In the mid-nineties, Ogre and producer Martin Atkins created the project known as Rx (formerly known as Ritalin). Rx released only one album, Bedside Toxicology, in 1998. He also toured extensively with Pigface (1991‚Äì1995) and Ministry (1987‚Äì1990) and appeared on a number of Pigface and Ministry-related recordings. Guantanamo Bay torture allegations Skinny Puppy have accused the US military of using their music to torture inmates at their Guantanamo Bay detention facility, without the band's knowledge or permission. In response, the band have sent an \\"invoice\\" to the Pentagon.

However, only relatively few species can harm humans; among which some can cause significant injury or, in rare cases, death. Like wasps, individual ants are capable of stinging multiple times as they do not lose their stingers. Fire ants Red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta The fire ants are a group of 20 species of New World ants which are reputed after their aggressiveness and painful stings. Four species are considered of relevant medical importance: Solenopsis invicta, Solenopsis richteri, Solenopsis geminata, and Solenopsis saevissima. The Red Imported Fire Ant S. invicta is the best studied among them, and reputed as the most dangerous species. S. invicta is expanding in range around the world and thus it is most often involved in medical emergencies. A person typically encounters problems with fire ants by inadvertently stepping onto one of their mounds, which causes the ants to swarm up the person's legs, attacking en masse. The ants quickly respond to alarm pheromones that are released by the first disturbed ants, causing a swarm followed by aggressive stinging. Fire ant stings are typically accompanied by burning and urticaria, followed by a welt formation. The welts often develop into white pustules that should not be scratched, as to avoid secondary infections. A few individuals are sensitive to the venom, and can, on rare occasions, die of anaphylaxis. In a survey of 29,300 physicians in the United States of America (in 1989), reports of 83 fatalities were obtained. Some fire ant attacks on humans confined to beds have also been noted; in some locations, fire ants can be a particular threat in medical facilities since they can have nesting colonies inside human habitations. It has been demonstrated that, whilst the burning sensation and pustule formation is an effect of the sting injecting insoluble venom alkaloids, the more serious allergic reactions are caused by venom protein allergens. Other species Argentine ant Apart from Solenopsis invicta and Solenopsis richteri, serious allergic reactions are known from ants belonging to 6 different subfamilies (Formicinae, Myrmeciinae, Ponerinae, Ectatomminae, Myrmicinae, and Pseudomyrmecinae) and 10 genera (Solenopsis, Formica, Myrmecia, Tetramorium, Pogonomyrmex, Pachycondyla, Odontomachus, Rhytidoponera, Pseudomyrmex, and Hypoponera). The Argentine ant, Linepithema humile is found in Argentina, Southern Europe, Southern US and California. They are small and are found in human habitations. They often kill other ant species. They have been noted as having the potential to carry pathogens in hospital environments. The pharaoh ant, Monomorium pharaonis is found around the world. It is not known for its sting, but has been involved in respiratory allergies Red bulldog ant Bulldog ants, from the genus Myrmecia, are native to Australia, with all but one of the ninety or so species found on the continent. Belonging to the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, they are among the most primitive extant ants in the world. This species is known to cause some fatalities in sensitive humans. Bullet ant Bullet ants, from the genus Paraponera, are found from Nicaragua southward to the Amazon Basin. They are and close relatives of the genus Dinoponera, which are New World ponerines known for their painful stings. Driver ants Driver ants, from the genus Dorylus, are found in the Old World, especially West Africa and the Congo Basin. Unlike the army ants of the New World, Old World army ants have a functional sting but rarely use it, preferring their razor-sharp, falcate mandibles for defense instead. Dorylus spp. colonies also reach larger sizes than Eciton. The Pogonomyrmex maricopa, found in Western US, are bright red myrmicine ants whose venom is the most potent of any ant species.

Barnes & Noble Publishing, 2003. p.43 and avant-garde metal.Wagner, Jeff. Mean Deviation. Bazillion Points Books, 2010. pp.116-124 Formed in 1981 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and released their debut, Morbid Tales, that year. This was followed by To Mega Therion (1985) and the highly experimental Into the Pandemonium (1987), all of which were widely praised. Their next album Cold Lake (1988) saw a new lineup and a radical change of style, which was widely derided. After the release of Vanity/Nemesis (1990), the group disbanded. It re-formed in 2001 and released the critically acclaimed Monotheist (2006), before disbanding following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008.September 9, 2008 ‚Äì PRESS RELEASE Retrieved from Internet Archive 6 January 2014. Their music included elements of various extreme metal styles. Their earlier music was mostly classified as thrash metal and black metal with an experimental streak, while their last album was more akin to doom metal and gothic metal. Celtic Frost were inspired by metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Venom as well as gothic rock groups like Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Christian DeathThomas Gabriel Fischer interview www.pyromusic.net Retrieved from Internet Archive 6 January 2014. and by the hardcore punk of Discharge.J. Bennett, \\"Procreation of the Wicked\\", Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces, Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, p. 34. History=Formation & first recordings (1984‚Äì1987)= Celtic Frost's frontman, guitarist and singer Tom Gabriel Fischer, adopted the alias Tom Warrior. With Steve Warrior on bass, he formed one of the earliest extreme metal bands, Hellhammer, in 1981. Steve Warrior was later replaced by Martin Eric Ain ‚Äì also a pseudonym. The band attracted a small international fan-base, got signed to Noise Records in Germany and recorded their debut EP Apocalyptic Raids in March 1984, now a rare find on eBay or second-hand record stores around the world. Metal publications were also skeptical of Hellhammer's musical endeavor. Metal Forces loathed the group; that started a long-lasting feud between that zine and Warrior, which kept Celtic Frost from playing in England for a couple of years.Gregori (2003), page 11. Rock Power was not fond of Hellhammer either ‚Äì they considered it \\"the most terrible, abhorrent, and atrocious thing ‚Äòmusicians‚Äô were ever allowed to record\\". In fact, they were \\"receiving miserable reviews everywhere\\", Warrior concluded.Fischer (2000), page 80. Regarding the controversial status of his former band, Thomas said: > Way back in 1984 and 85, when Martin Eric Ain and I recorded Celtic Frost's > first two albums Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion, Hellhammer lasted on us > almost like a curse. Even though Hellhammer was the very reason we had > thought over our goals and conceived the Frost, HH's left-overs kept being > mighty rocks in our way. Many voices saw Frost as the same band with just a > name-change. The lack of musical quality in HH made it almost impossible for > us to get an unbiased reaction for Frost. To make a long story short, it > almost killed all our work and dreams. By May 1984, Hellhammer had disbanded. Fischer and Ain, along with session drummer Stephen Priestly, regrouped as Celtic Frost. Their 1984 debut EP, Morbid Tales was a hit in the underground metal scene, and the band set out on its first tour, through Germany and Austria. This was followed with an EP Emperor's Return. Both early releases are now available on one CD. One of their more influential recordings was 1985's To Mega Therion which did not feature Ain on bass, but stand-in Dominic Steiner. The cover artwork is a painting by H.R. Giger entitled Satan I. The album was a major influence on the then-developing death metal and black metal genres.Shapiro 1993, page 111. Ain did return after the album was recorded however. These albums were some of the pivotal LPs for underground metal and introduced a new and more varied sound. Celtic Frost, along with Venom and Bathory were pioneers in the still underground black metal scene, although Celtic Frost were much more experimental with the addition of classical instruments, operatic female vocals and sampling. =Stylistic changes, internal struggles, and first breakup (1987‚Äì1993)= In 1987 followed Into the Pandemonium. The album is more varied than many of Celtic Frost's past LPs, with unlikely covers (Wall of Voodoo's \\"Mexican Radio\\"), emotionally charged love songs, the album's recurring industrial-influenced rhythmic songs of demons and destruction, traditional Frost styled songs about dreams and fear, and a dark, classical piece with female vocals. The album is vastly different from the band's previous work and cemented its late 80s avant-garde metal term; it is also a departure from the extreme style found on the band's previous albums, Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion that Celtic Frost had become known for. However, it does have the recurring symphonic elements found on previous albums. The album has a more classic heavy metal style within the songs with elements of industrial, classical and gothic rock, and even has an industrial/electronic body music (EBM)-inspired rhythm in \\"One in Their Pride\\". It does have a few black metal elements remaining in Warrior's vocals, though, and some thrash- influenced guitar riffs. After a subsequent North American tour (which saw the addition of a second guitarist, Ron Marks to the group's ranks), financial trouble, personal tension between the band members and an ill-fated relationship with their record label led to a dissolution of the band. Six months later, Warrior reformed the band with Stephen Priestly back on drums, Oliver Amberg on guitars and Curt Victor Bryant on bass and recorded the fourth studio album Cold Lake, released on 1 September 1988 by Noise Records. Despite it being marketed to exploit the mass appeal of glam metal, the album has more of a traditional heavy metal sound. Bryant fired Amberg and former live show guitarist Ron Marks returned for the recording of Vanity/Nemesis in 1990. The most significant change, however, was the return of early bassist Martin Eric Ain, but Celtic Frost's reputation did not fully recover. The group's next (and, as it would turn out, last for several years) album was a collection of rare recordings called Parched With Thirst Am I and Dying (1992). The compilation's title was inspired by an old Roman prayer.Raggett, Ned. \\"Parched with Thirst Am I and Dying ‚Äì Celtic Frost\\". AllMusic.com. Retrieved 26 September 2011. It featured unreleased material, re-recorded versions of older songs and some studio session versions. A final proposed album titled \\"Under Apollyon's Sun\\" was never made under that title, although Fischer co-founded a new group called Apollyon Sun. =Post-breakup (1993‚Äì2001)= Several years following the disbanding of Celtic Frost, and after quite some time spent away from the music industry, Fischer co-founded a new group called Apollyon Sun with his close friend Erol Unala on guitars in the mid-1990s and recorded an EP God Leaves (And Dies) and a full-length album Sub. Although clearly based on Celtic Frost's dark and more adventurous music, Apollyon Sun was an industrial metal project. During his hiatus from music, Fischer had also finished work on an autobiographical book, called Are You Morbid?, which was published by London-based Sanctuary Publishing to fan acclaim in 2000. Currently averaging a 3.73 rating on Goodreads. =Reunion (2001‚Äì2008)= Tom Warrior performing in 2006. In late 2001, Fischer and Ain began to write music together again, along with Unala on guitar and, from late 2002, experienced Swiss drummer Franco Sesa (also known within the group under the stage name Inverted Cross). The aim was to develop and record a new, very dark and heavy album. The completion of the project took far longer than anticipated (in part due to the DIY nature of the project and the project's financing) but finally resulted, in late 2005, in what Fischer and Ain describe as \\"perhaps the darkest album Celtic Frost have ever recorded\\", based on a combination of the musical aura of To Mega Therion and Into the Pandemonium. The newest and seventh Celtic Frost album was financed by the group itself through its own label, Prowling Death Records, and publishing imprint, Diktatur des Kapitals. Prowling Death Records originally was the self-founded underground label which released the Hellhammer demos and managed Hellhammer's career in 1983 and 1984. The album was produced by Celtic Frost with Peter T√§gtgren (of Bloodbath/Hypocrisy/Pain) and mixed by Fischer and Ain. Celtic Frost and Prowling Death Records subsequently entered into a worldwide licensing deal with Century Media Records. The album, titled Monotheist, was released on May 29, 2006. On May 29, 2006, Celtic Frost embarked on the most extensive tour of the band's career, the \\"Monotheist Tour\\", initially headlining festivals (e.g. the Wacken Open Air festival, in front of an audience of 50,000) across Europe the United States and Canada in 2006, and the group's first ever shows in Japan in January 2007. In early 2007 the European leg of the tour took place and a return to the United States as a special guest to Type O Negative. Further festival appearances and concerts followed in mid-2007. On stage, Celtic Frost play with an additional tour guitar player, who plays rhythm guitar and provides a fuller sound. This position was initially filled by Anders Odden (Cadaver, Satyricon, Magenta), and later by V Santura (of Dark Fortress). In early 2007, Celtic Frost began writing material for a new album. Metalunderground posted a statement from Tom Fischer regarding the new album. > Only a few hours until I am to depart to Norway for a few weeks to > participate in the production of a black metal project with close friends > and peers. In early March I shall return to Switzerland to take further > steps towards the realization of my own black metal/doom side project, the > idea for which has taken an increasingly defined shape during the past > months. Fischer spoke to Spanish metal webzine Hall of Metal about new material: \\"I'm actually working on a new album of Celtic Frost and I think it's going to be really extreme and dark. Celtic Frost has its own style, its own sound and it expresses a lot of emotions. The music I write shows the state of my life, and now I feel very comfortable with such dark music.\\" As of Celtic Frost's announcement of their second breakup in September 2008, there is no talk of recording and releasing the new album. The last shows of Celtic Frost were in Mexico, one on October 12, 2007, in Monterrey, and the last one on October 13, 2007, in Mexico City. =Definitive breakup, Triptykon and Martin Eric Ain's death (2008‚Äìpresent)= Celtic Frost performing in 2006. Fischer tendered his resignation from Celtic Frost on April 9, 2008, with this message displayed on the band's official website: > Celtic Frost singer and guitarist Tom Gabriel Fischer has left Celtic Frost > due to the irresolvable, severe erosion of the personal basis so urgently > required to collaborate within a band so unique, volatile, and ambitious. Bassist Ain stated that the band was \\"still alive, albeit in a coma of sorts.\\" He went on further to say that the remainder of the band is \\"not going to continue recording or touring,\\" saying this \\"would be preposterous\\" without Fischer. Fischer has himself gone on to form a new band called Triptykon, featuring Celtic Frost touring guitarist V Santura, original Celtic Frost drummer Reed St. Mark (although he has since departed and was replaced by Norman Lonhard), as well as bassist Vanja Slajh. Fischer has also said that his new band will sound similar to the direction Celtic Frost took on their 2006 album, Monotheist. On September 9, 2008, Celtic Frost members Martin Eric Ain and Tom Gabriel Fischer confirmed on Celtic Frost's official website that the band had \\"jointly decided to lay Celtic Frost to rest for good\\". On October 21, 2017, Martin Eric Ain died from a heart attack. Style and influences Celtic Frost's style gradually changed over the years. The band's early work has been described as thrash metal and death metal. Celtic Frost has also been described as avant-garde metal due to their use of classical and electronica elements in some of their music, such as on their album To Mega Therion. Although Celtic Frost are often described as black metal, according to authors Axl Rosenberg and Christopher Krovatin, the band's \\"music was too tight, and its connection to old school rock 'n' roll music too readily apparent, to be black metal.\\" Celtic Frost's later work has been described as doom metal. Tom G. Warrior said that there were two types of music that influenced him: heavy metal and new wave. \\"In Heavy Metal, it's fair to say bands like Black Sabbath, Angel Witch and Venom influenced us. Martin and I were heavily influenced by the New Wave music of the time too, such as Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Christian Death and I think it's a mix of these musical directions that influenced the sound of Celtic Frost\\". Ain was also marked by Joy Division while Warrior also came from a jazz and classical background. \\"I loved the ‚Äò70s prog bands like Emerson, Lake & Palmer, early Roxy Music\\". Legacy Celtic Frost have influenced a number of black metal, death metal, thrash metal, and standard heavy metal bands. The band Therion, for example, took its band name from the album To Mega Therion. Other bands that have cited Celtic Frost as an influence, or have covered Celtic Frost, include Anthrax, Obituary, Death, Benediction, Brutal Truth, Neurosis, Eyehategod, Cradle of Filth, Marduk, Dimmu Borgir, Goatwhore, Sepultura, Cancer, Asphyx, Pro-Pain, Gorgoroth, Gallhammer, Paradise Lost, Evoken, Napalm Death, and many others. Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic from Nirvana were fans of Celtic Frost. Dave Grohl (ex-Nirvana, Foo Fighters) and Mark Tremonti (Alter Bridge, Creed) have both stated on several occasions that Celtic Frost were an influence. Grohl subsequently invited Celtic Frost singer Tom Gabriel Fischer to participate in the recordings of his 2004 solo project, Probot, resulting in the co-written song \\"Big Sky\\". Alternative country singer Ryan Adams has also claimed influence from Celtic Frost, amongst many other metal bands. In 1996, Dwell Records released In Memory of Celtic Frost, a collection of songs covered by other bands. Notable bands that appeared on this tribute collection include Enslaved, covering the song \\"Procreation (of the Wicked)\\"; Opeth, covering the song \\"Circle of the Tyrants\\"; Swedish death metal band Grave, covering the song \\"Mesmerized\\"; Canadian thrash metal band Slaughter, covering the song \\"Dethroned Emperor\\"; Apollyon Sun (featuring Tom G. Warrior himself), covering the song \\"Babylon Fell\\"; and the Norwegian black metal bands Emperor, covering \\"Massacra\\", and Mayhem, covering the song \\"Visual Aggression\\". The tribute album also features Celtic Frost songs covered by several lesser known and now defunct metal bands. The hard to find CD is now out of print. Despite this, when Fischer was asked to comment on their influence on heavy metal, he replied: \\"No, I try to stay away from that. I'm a musician, I don't want to get involved with all that. It's not healthy. I want to do good albums. I'm still alive and I feel there's still so much in front of me. I don't want to be bothered with who has influence and where we stand and all that. I think it's a negative thing.\\" In 2015, Corpse Flower Records released a tribute of their own entitled Morbid Tales! A Tribute to Celtic Frost. Notably, it compiles a number of Celtic Frost covers by other bands, including Child Bite (featuring Phil Anselmo), Acid Witch, Municipal Waste, Hayward (featuring members of Neurosis), among others. In 2018, British deathcore band, Black Tongue covered the song, A Dying God Coming Into Human Flesh, on their second album, Nadir which was released on Halloween of 2018.

Together they published one of their first releases on the first Slovene hip hop compilation 5'00\\" of Fame za narodov blagor (EN: 5'00\\" of Fame for the National Welfare). Their first solo LP was V besedi je moƒç (EN:The power is in the word) from 2002.

The Paleoproterozoic is also the longest era of the Earth's geological history. It was during this era that the continents first stabilized. Paleontological evidence suggests that the Earth's rotational rate during this era resulted in 20-hour days ~1.8 billion years ago, implying a total of ~450 days per year.  Paleoatmosphere  Before the enormous increase in atmospheric oxygen, almost all existing lifeforms were anaerobic organisms, i.e., their metabolism was based upon a form of cellular respiration that did not require oxygen. Free oxygen in large amounts is toxic to most anaerobic organisms. Consequently, the majority of the anaerobic lifeforms on Earth died when the atmospheric free-oxygen levels soared in an extinction event called the Great Oxidation Event. The only lifeforms that survived were either those resistant to the oxidizing and poisonous effects of oxygen, or those sequestered in oxygen-free environments. The sudden increase of atmospheric free oxygen and the ensuing extinction of the vulnerable lifeforms is widely considered to be the one of the first and most significant mass extinctions in the history of the Earth.  Emergence of Eukarya  Many crown node eukaryotes (from which the modern-day eukaryotic lineages would have arisen) - or the divergences that imply them between various groups of eukaryotes - have been ostensibly dated to around the time of the Paleoproterozoic era. While there is some debate as to the exact period at which Eukaryotes evolved, current understanding places it somewhere in this period.  Geological events  During this era, the earliest global-scale continent-continent collision belts developed. These continent and mountain building events are represented by the 2.1‚Äì2.0 Ga Trans-Amazonian and Eburnean orogens in South America and West Africa; the ~2.0 Ga Limpopo Belt in southern Africa; the 1.9‚Äì1.8 Ga Trans-Hudson, Penokean, Taltson‚ÄìThelon, Wopmay, Ungava and Torngat orogens in North America, the 1.9‚Äì1.8 Ga Nagssugtoqidian Orogen in Greenland; the 1.9‚Äì1.8 Ga Kola‚ÄìKarelia, Svecofennian, Volhyn-Central Russian, and Pachelma orogens in Baltica (Eastern Europe); the 1.9‚Äì1.8 Ga Akitkan Orogen in Siberia; the ~1.95 Ga Khondalite Belt and ~1.85 Ga Trans-North China Orogen in North China. These continental collision belts are interpreted as having resulted from one or more 2.0‚Äì1.8 Ga global-scale collision events that then led to the assembly of a Proterozoic supercontinent named Columbia or Nuna. Felsic volcanism in what is now northern Sweden led to the formation of the Kiruna and Arvidsjaur porphyries. The lithospheric mantle of Patagonia's oldest blocks formed.

The drink is served shaken with ice (on the rocks), blended with ice (frozen margarita), or without ice (straight up). Although it has become acceptable to serve a margarita in a wide variety of glass types, ranging from cocktail and wine glasses to pint glasses and even large schooners, the drink is traditionally served in the eponymous margarita glass, a stepped-diameter variant of a cocktail glass or champagne coupe. Origin According to cocktail historian David Wondrich, the margarita is related to a popular Mexican drink, the Daisy (margarita is Spanish for \\"daisy\\"), remade with tequila instead of brandy. It became popular during Prohibition as people drifted over the border for alcohol. There is an account from 1936 of Iowa newspaper editor James Graham finding such a cocktail in Tijuana, years before any of the other margarita \\"creation myths\\". 1937 Cafe Royal Cocktail Book contains a recipe for a Picador using the same concentrations of tequila, triple sec and lime juice as a margarita. One of the earliest stories is of the margarita being invented in 1938 by Carlos \\"Danny\\" Herrera at his restaurant Rancho La Gloria, halfway between Tijuana and Rosarito, Baja California, created for customer and former Ziegfeld dancer Marjorie King, who was allergic to many spirits, but not to tequila.Paul Chavez, \\"Danny Herrera, Inventor of Margarita, Dies at Age 90,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 14, 1992. This story was related by Herrera and also by bartender Albert Hernandez, acknowledged for popularizing a margarita in San Diego after 1947, at the La Plaza restaurant in La Jolla. There are also claims that the margarita was first mixed in Ju√°rez, Chihuahua at Tommy's Place Bar on July 4, 1942 by Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Morales. Morales later left bartending in Mexico to become a US citizen, where he worked as a milkman for 25 years. Mexico's official news agency Notimex and many experts have said Morales has the strongest claim to having invented the margarita.\\"Francisco Morales; Credited With Inventing Margarita,\\" Los Angeles Times, January 8, 1997. Others say the inventor was Dallas socialite Margarita Sames, when she concocted the drink for her guests at her Acapulco, Guerrero vacation home in 1948. Tommy Hilton reportedly attended, bringing the drink back to the Hilton chain of hotels. However, Jose Cuervo was already running ad campaigns for the margarita three years earlier, in 1945, with the slogan, \\"Margarita: It's more than a girl's name.\\" According to Jose Cuervo, the cocktail was invented in 1938 by a bartender in honor of Mexican showgirl Rita de la Rosa.Lisa Bramen, \\"The History of the Margarita\\", Smithsonian, May 5, 2009.Stacy Finz, \\"Mastering the margarita: Tequila aside, even experts can't agree on what goes into the legendary cocktail\\", San Francisco Chronicle, July 25, 2008. The Balinese Room Another common origin tale begins the cocktail's history at the legendary Balinese Room in Galveston, Texas where, in 1948, head bartender Santos Cruz created the margarita for singer Peggy (Margaret) Lee. He supposedly named it after the Spanish version of her name, Margarita.Rosenberg Library Museum \\"Lost Treasure: The Balinese Room\\" Balinese Room. The first known publication of a margarita recipe was in the December 1953 issue of Esquire, with a recipe calling for an ounce of tequila, a dash of triple sec and the juice of half a lime or lemon. A recipe for a tequila-based cocktail first appeared in the 1930 book My New Cocktail Book by G.F. Steele. Without noting a specific recipe or inventor, a drink called the Tequila Daisy was mentioned in the Syracuse Herald as early as 1936. Margarita is Spanish for Daisy, which is a nickname for Margaret.\\"Once upon a time in Mexico\\" , Imbibe, March/April 2010. A later, certainly false, story is that the margarita was invented in October 1961, at a party in Houston, Texas, by party goer Robert James \\"Rusty\\" Thomson while acting as bartender. He concocted a mixture of equal parts tequila, Controy orange liqueur, lime, and crushed ice in a salt- rimmed glass. However, Thomson's recipe was made with Damiana Liqueur, not Cointreau orange liqueur. It is said that the idea was an experiment after running out of rum while making frozen daiquiris. Variations Margaritas come in a variety of flavors and colors. The IBA (IBA Official list of Cocktails) standard is 10:4:3, that is tequila:triple sec:fresh lime juice. The \\"Original Margarita\\" recipe as given by Cointreau on their website has slightly more of their own sweet liqueur: 1 part white tequila, part Cointreau, and part fresh squeezed lime juice. =Flavored tequila= Apple-cinnamon tequila, triple sec, cranberry juice, fresh lime juice, and an apple wedge or lemon twist for garnish combine to form the Cranberry Margarita With Apple-Cinnamon Tequila, a fall seasonal drink. =Flavored liqueurs= Besides Cointreau, other orange-flavored liqueurs that might be used include Grand Marnier (yielding the \\"Cadillac Margarita\\"), Gran Gala, other brands of triple sec, or blue cura√ßao (yielding the blue margarita). When sweeter fruit juices or freshly pur√©ed fruits are added to the margarita, the orange-flavored liqueur is often reduced or eliminated entirely. In addition to orange-flavored liqueurs, secondary liqueurs may occasionally be added to a cocktail, including melon-flavored or black raspberry-flavored. Other flavors include pineapple and watermelon. =Fresh lime juice= Freshly squeezed lime juice is the key ingredient. The most common lime in the United States is the thick-skinned Persian lime. However, margaritas in Mexico are generally made with Mexican limes (Key limes). These are small, thin-skinned limes and have more tart and an often bitter flavor compared to Persian limes. =Frozen margarita= The frozen margarita is a margarita served as an ice slush, similar to other tropical- inspired frozen mixed drinks like the hurricane or pi√±a colada. The ingredients can be processed with ice in a kitchen blender, or for larger output, a slush or soft-serve ice cream machine is used: a cooled, horizontal cylinder has a rotating impeller which churns the mix so it will not freeze solid, and the thick half-frozen slush is dispensed from a spout. Frozen margaritas were first served in La Jolla, when Albert Hernandez Sr. stopped using crushed ice and instead combined the ingredients in a blender in 1947. The dedicated frozen margarita machine was introduced by Mariano Martinez in Dallas in 1971.Franz Lidz, \\"The Uniquely Texan Origins of the Frozen Margarita\\", Smithsonian Magazine, July 2018 A lemonade or limeade margarita can be quickly whipped up by using frozen lemonade or limeade concentrate in place of lime juice. =Fruit sodas and sports drinks= Fruity sodas such as fruit punch, lime, pineapple, or mandarin orange Jarritos, or sports drinks such as blue or orange Gatorade, can substitute for triple sec. A margarita made with orange soda and beer is a sunrise beer margarita; if it is made with carbonated fruit punch soda, it is a sunset margarita. The variant that uses grapefruit soda is called a Paloma. =Other fruits and vegetables= Alternate fruits and juice mixtures can also be used in a margarita. Fruits like mango, peach, strawberry, banana, melon, raspberry, or avocado are suitable for creating this drink. Orange juice and pomegranate juice (poured down the inner side of the glass) can make a sunset margarita (so named because the orange is at the top and the red at the bottom). Many recipes call for a splash of orange juice. These days, margarita can be prepared in many different ways. When the word \\"margarita\\" is used by itself, it typically refers to the lime or lemon juice margarita, but when other juices are used, the fruits are typically added as adjectives in the name; with lime juice or lemon juice added to give it a characteristic margarita flavor (a wedge of lime is often added to the glass). Other varieties of margarita include fruit margarita, top-shelf margarita and virgin margarita. Coconut cream, coconut milk, and coconut water can also be added to margaritas, e.g. skinny margaritas that substitute, e.g., pineapple juice for liqueurs. Margaritas can also be made with vegetables such as carrots, beets, cucumber, and celery. Image:Blended Margarita.jpgA blended margarita File:Margarita.jpgA margarita served in an old fashioned glass =Beer cocktails= A beermarita (or Coronarita) is a beer cocktail that has a bottle of Corona beer or other light-flavored beer poured upside down into a margarita on the rocks. =Skinny= A skinny margarita is a two-ingredient cocktail that leaves out the liqueur and only has tequila and a hint of Rose's lime juice, shaken over ice and served optionally with salt. Related drinks A margarita with vodka substituted for tequila is a kamikaze. On September 15th, 2020, Red Lobster and Mountain Dew announced the creation of the Dew Garita, which is variation of the classic margarita in which Mountain Dew substitutes for orange liqueur and lime juice. Glass A traditional margarita glass Margaritas may be served in a variety of glasses, most notably the eponymous margarita glass, a variant of the classic champagne coupe; this is particularly associated with blended fruit margaritas, and the glass is also used for dishes such as guacamole or shrimp cocktails. In formal settings margaritas are often served in a standard cocktail glass, while in informal settings, particularly with ice, margaritas may be served in an old fashioned glass. Popularity The margarita cocktail was the \\"Drink of the Month\\" in Esquire magazine, December 1953, pg. 76: :1 ounce tequila :Dash of Triple Sec :Juice of lime or lemon :Pour over crushed ice, stir. Rub the rim of a stem glass with rind of lemon or lime, spin in salt‚Äîpour, and sip. It was further popularized by the 1977 song \\"Margaritaville\\" by Jimmy Buffett, and in 2004 it was described as \\"the most popular mixed drink in America\\". Another reason that has been given for the margarita's popularity is that it feels more complete than a drink that only has sweet and sour flavors, since it engages a third primary taste, salty.

Spesivtsev, with the assistance of his mother Lyudmila, targeted street children and young women across Novokuznetsk by luring them into their apartment, where they would be tortured and killed, and sometimes cannibalized. Despite only being convicted for 4 murders, Spesivtsev confessed to 19 murders that he was accused of by police, and based on evidence is believed to have committed over 80 killings as early as 1991. Early life Alexander Nikolayevich Spesivtsev was born 1 March 1970, and raised in an apartment on Pionerskiy Prospekt in central Novokuznetsk, the largest city in Kemerovo Oblast, RSFSR, Soviet Union. He was underweight at birth but survived, although he was frequently ill afterwards. During childhood Spesivtsev was considered unsocial, did not have friends, and was bullied while at school. His mother, Lyudmila Spesivtseva, worked at a nearby school and the prosecutor's office and was very affectionate towards her son. His father was an abusive alcoholic, who abandoned the family. Spesivtsev and his mother held a strong but unusual relationship, as Lyudmila would regularly show her son photographs of corpses from books about criminal cases at a very young age, and the two shared a bed until Spesivtsev was 12. Growing up Spesivtsev showed increasing sadistic tendencies, and in 1988 met his first girlfriend. Ostensibly poetic by nature, they often went for walks together; but the fa√ßade didn't last. Arguments led to her breaking up with him, which Spesivstev did not accept. He kidnapped her, and tortured her for a month in his apartment, until she died of Sepsis. For this, at the age of 18 Spesivstev was assigned to the Oryol Special Psychiatric Hospital (–û—Ä–ª–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Å–∏—Ö–∏–∞—Ç—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–ø–µ—Ü–ª–µ—á–µ–±–Ω–∏—Ü–µ). Crimes Though in official databases he was (then) still listed as undergoing treatment, in 1991 he was discharged. Once out, he began associating with transients and beggars, and developed a deep-seated hatred of street children; whom he viewed as a byproduct of Russia's emerging democracy. Spesivstev was likewise particularly embittered by an episode during his commitment at the Oryol Hospital, in which he asked another patient to insert a metal ball into his urethra to make him more virile. This had the opposite effect, causing erectile dysfunction and genital pains. Alexander, then Lyudmila began to lure victims into their apartment, chosen at random, where Alexander would torture and eventually kill them. Unaccompanied street children, attending discoth√®ques and playing in construction sites had become commonplace in the impoverished city of Novokuznetsk since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and they became his main target. The bodies of victims would sometimes be cannibalized Lyudmila would dispose of unwanted remains by throwing them from buckets into the Aba River, late at night. Investigation The first sign of his victims arose when the gangrenous severed heads, torsos, and arms of unidentifiable children were found washed up on the banks of the River Aba. It was not immediately believed there was a serial killer, and only after several large groups of unattended children disappeared was a serial mass murderer suspected as being active in the city. Otherwise, investigators in the regional Directorate of Internal Affairs suspected that organ smugglers were acting within the city's boundaries. Several criminal gangs from the Caucusus region were active in Novokuznetsk at the time, and police searched the baggage of outward flights. Additionally, several hundred internal troops and police officers were deployed to search for the killer; at some point thought to be Oleg Rylkov. Arrest and sentencing Witness statements following the disappearance of several girls who were seen leaving a store with his mother helped police identify her. Her son was officially listed as undergoing a course of treatment at a psychiatric hospital. One morning, the neighborhood police officer and a plumber complained that a resident refused to let them in his apartment to relieve a clog. The resident claimed he was mentally ill and kept in his apartment. This alarmed police, as her son was ostensibly still at the hospital in Oryol. The two men forced their way into his apartment, where they smelt an intense and putrid odor, resembling unspecified rotting. A woman bleeding from a severe stab wound to the chest, and a decapitated, de-limbed torso was uncovered in the bathtub. Spesivtsev escaped \\"at the final moment\\" via the building's roof.

The last day on Corinth, Tony Robert-Fleury, 1870 Lucius Mummius (2nd century BC), was a Roman statesman and general. Mummius was the first of his family to rise to the rank of consul, making him a novus homo. He received the agnomen Achaicus for his victories while consul in 146 BC, when he conquered the Achaean League and destroyed the ancient city of Corinth following the Battle of Corinth (146 BC), in the process bringing all of Greece under Roman control. Career Almost nothing is known about Lucius Mummius early career. We do known he won one of the praetorships (for 154 BC) during the elections of 153 BC. =Hispania= In 154 BC the Senate assigned Mummius the task of restoring order in Hispania Ulterior (Further Spain), which was reeling from a revolt by native Lusitanian (the Lustianian Rebellion of 155-150 BC). The rebelion was led by the Lusitanian chieftans Punicus and Caesarus. In the initial phases of his campaign he experienced several reverses, but he regrouped and at Ocile he led his army of 9,000 foot and 500 horse in a victorious battle against a numerically superior force of Lusitanians, killing about 15,000 rebels and lifting the siege; his successor, Marcus Atilius, went on to take Oxthracae, the largest city in Lusitania. Mummius was awarded a triumph for his victory over the Lusitanians. =Corinth= Mummius was elected consul for 146 BC. He was appointed to take command of the Achaean War, inheriting the command from Metellus Macedonicus. Having obtained an easy victory over the incapable Achaean leader Diaeus, Mummius entered Corinth after a victory over the defending forces. All the men of Corinth were put to the sword, the women and children were sold into slavery, and the statues, paintings and works of art were seized and shipped to Rome. Corinth was then reduced to ashes. However, at least two ancient authors give accounts that suggest Corinth was not completely destroyed.Cicero in Tusculanae Quaestiones 3.53, and Dio Cassius 21. The apparently needless cruelty of Mummius in Corinth, is explained by Mommsen as due to the instructions of the senate, prompted by the mercantile party, which was eager to dispel a dangerous commercial rival. According to Polybius, Mummius was unable to resist the pressure of those around him. In the subsequent settlement of affairs, Mummius exhibited considerable administrative powers and a high degree of justice and integrity, which gained him the respect of the inhabitants. He especially abstained from offending their religious sensibilities. On his return to Rome he was honored with a triumph, and was the first novus homo to receive an agnomen for military services. =Censor= In 142 BC he was censor with Scipio Aemilianus Africanus, whose severity frequently brought him into collision with his more lenient colleague. Indifference His indifference to works of art and ignorance of their value is shown by his well-known remark to those who contracted for the shipment of the treasures of Corinth to Rome, that \\"if they lost or damaged them, they would have to replace them.\\" He was, in other words, so unaware that a \\"new- for-old-deal\\" was inappropriate for such valuable antiques. Mummius plundered Corinth and sent home ship loads of its priceless art and rich furniture to Rome. He issued a dire warning to other Greeks by burning the venerable city to the ground and massacring the remaining inhabitants or selling them into slavery. The destruction of Corinth marked the end of free Greece. For the theatrical pageants exhibited by him he erected a theatre with improved acoustical conditions and seats after the Greek model, thus marking a distinct advance in the construction of places of entertainment.

It is an area of study concerned with the relationship between sociology and sports, and also various socio-cultural structures, patterns, and organizations or groups involved with sport. This area of study discusses the positive impact sports have on individual people and society as a whole economically, financially, and socially. Sociology of sport attempts to view the actions and behavior of sports teams and their players through the eyes of a sociologist. The emergence of the sociology of sport (though not the name itself) dates from the end of the 19th century, when first social psychological experiments dealing with group effects of competition and pace-making took place. Besides cultural anthropology and its interest in games in the human culture, one of the first efforts to think about sports in a more general way was Johan Huizinga's Homo Ludens or Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class.[5] Homo Ludens discusses the importance of the element of play in culture and society. Huizinga suggests that play, specifically sport, is primary to and a necessary condition of the generation of culture. These written works contributed to the rise of the study of sociology of sport. In 1970, sports sociology gained significant attention as an organized, legitimate field of study. The North American Society for the Sociology of Sport was formed in 1978 with the objective of studying the field.[6] Its research outlet, the Sociology of Sport Journal, was formed in 1984.  Binary Divisions Within Sports There are many perspectives through which sport can be viewed. Therefore, very often some binary divisions are stressed, and many sports sociologists have shown that those divisions can create constructs within the ideologies of gender and affect the relationships between genders, as well as advocate or challenge social and racial class structures. Some of these binary divisions include: professional vs. amateur, mass vs. top-level, active vs. passive/spectator, men vs. women, sports vs. play (as an antithesis to organized and institutionalized activity). Not only can binary divisions be seen within sports themselves, but they are also seen in the research of sports. The field of research has mainly been dominated by men because many believe that women's input or research is inauthentic compared to men's research. Some women researchers also feel as though they have to \\"earn\\" their place within the sports research field whereas men, for the most part, do not. While women researchers in this field do have to deal with gender-related issues when it comes to their research, it does not prevent them from being able to gather and understand the data they are collecting. Sports sociologists believe that women can have a unique perspective when gathering research on sports since they are able to more closely look at and understand the female fan side of sporting events. Following feminist or other reflexive and tradition-breaking paradigms, sports are sometimes studied as contested activities, i.e. as activities in the center of various people/groups interests (connection of sports and gender, mass media, or state-politics). These perspectives provide people with different ways to think about sports and figure out the differences between the binary divisions. Sports have always been of tremendous impact to the world as a whole, as well as individual societies and the people within them. There are so many positive aspects to the world of sport, specifically, organized sport. Sports involve community values, attempting to establish and exercise good morals and ethics. Spectator sports provide watchers with an enlivenment through key societal values displayed in the \\"game\\". Becoming a fan teaches you a large variety of skills as well that are a very important part of everyday life in the office, at home, and on the go. Some of these skills include teamwork, leadership, creativity, and individuality. = Gender in Sports = Sports need to involve sociology for several reasons. Problems such as injuries in the world of sports are inevitable. When there are recurring problems within a sports team or individual, you need to understand how to manage and deal with it in the safest, most efficient way possible. Sociology can help explain reasons for which the problem occurred, which can be very beneficial. In this way it can function as a constructively critical friend, rather than you being in the shadows. In most premodern societies, the gender role for females and males in sports was enforced at a young age. The sociology that formed surrounding sports enforced the idea that sports were too masculine for women and were encouraged to play noncompetitive games while men competed. One of the initial purposes of sports and games was to prepare young children for adulthood. Another purpose of organized sports and games is to teach life values and good morals through practice, teamwork, discipline, and much more. The separation between the roles of men and women in a society of sports is expressed through media and gender identity. On media, the sports viewership varies by gender. Men's sports are more prominent in the media versus women's sports and the sports broadcast vary. On NCAA news, the text and text space greater than 2:1 coverage of men‚Äôs sports over women‚Äôs, the pictures are around 2:1 male athletes over female athletes. From this study, it can be found that men have an advantage over women in sports. For males the sports typically include football, hockey, baseball, soccer, basketball, rugby, pro wrestling and boxing. However, women's sports typically include figure skating, gymnastics, skiing, and diving. However, both men and women do play every sport that exists today , but on the sport side there are still have gender stereotype. There is a contrast in the sports for each gender: the men's sports generally include confrontational, combative coordination and the women's sports typically are less aggressive and more individualized. Over the past century, women have been given more opportunities to participate in sports, and not just in sports that are considered more \\"feminine.\\" Lyndsay MC Hayhurst, a Faculty of Physical Education and Health at the University of Toronto, states that research on women and girls who participate in sports has shown to \\"lend [them] the opportunity to challenge and resist their domestic duties, improve their social networks and relations with communities, confront gender norms, boost self-confidence, advance communications skills, and increase their ability to make decisions regarding their own well-being.\\" However, some sports sociologists question whether these programs for women are more focused on the masculinity and male-oriented view of sports rather than actually pushing it more towards a female-oriented view. Participation in ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù sports creates gender identity conflict for females, likewise participation in ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù sports creates gender identity conflict for males. This is something that is being reduced year by year, as society advances towards gender equality and closing the wage gap.  Theories in Sociology of Sport  Today, most sports sociologists identify with at least one of four essential theories that define the relationship between sports and society, namely structural functionalism, social conflict, feminism, and symbolic interactionism. Theories attempt to explain why groups of people elect to perform certain actions and how societies, or teams, react or change in a certain way. Structural Functionalism views society, or the world of sport, as a complex, but interconnected system, where each part works together as a functional whole. Social conflict theory views society, or the world of sport as a system of groups that are not equal, and therefore consistently generate conflict and change. Feminism if often associated with a group of women trying to overpower men, but that is simply not true! It views society as traditionally being unequal in the favor of men, while society strives for equality between the sexes. Lastly, symbolic interactionism is the view of social behavior that emphasizes gestural and linguistic communication and its subjective understanding, especially the role of language in the development of a child as a social being.  Emotion in Sports  Emotion has always been a huge part of sports as it can affect both athletes and the spectators themselves. Theorists and sociologists who study the impact of emotions in sports try to classify emotions into categories. Controversial, debated, and discussed intensely, these classifications are not definitive or set in stone. Emotion is very important in sports; athletes can use them to convey specific and significant information to their teammates and coaches and they can use emotion to send false signals to confuse their opponents. In addition to athletes using emotion to their advantage, emotion can also have a negative impact on athletes and their performances. For example, \\"stage fright,\\" or nervousness and apprehension, can impact their performance in their sport, be it in a positive or negative way. Depending on the level of sports, the level of emotion differs. In professional sports, emotions can be extremely intense because there are many more people in many distinct roles who are involved. There are the professional athletes, the coaching staff, the referees, the television crew, the commentators, and last but not least, the fans and spectators. There is much more public press, pressure, and self-pressure. It is extremely difficult to not get emotionally invested in sports; sports are very good at bringing out the worst qualities in people. There have been violent brawls when one team beats another in an intense game, loud fighting and yelling, and intense verbal arguments as well. Emotion is also highly contagious, especially if there are many emotional people in one space. Alternative viewpoints Jean-Marie Brohm in \\"Sport: A Prison of Measured Time\\" presents a Marxist critique of organized sport as an instrument of indoctrination and subordination.

The Vatican City flag is modeled on the 1808 yellow and white flag of the earlier Papal States, to which a papal tiara and keys were later added. The Vatican (and the Holy See) also refers to it, interchangeably, as the flag of the Holy See. Description Table flag The flag consists of two vertical bands, one of gold or yellow (hoist side) and one of white with the crossed keys of Saint Peter and the Papal Tiara centered in the white band. The crossed keys consist of a golden and a silver key, in which the silver key is placed in the dexter position. It is one of only two square sovereign-state flags, the other being the flag of Switzerland. The coat of arms of Vatican City is present in the white half. The coat of arms consists of: * the papal tiara (as used under the pontificate of Pius XI); * the two keys which represent the Keys of Heaven (according to the Gospel of Matthew 16:19) given by Jesus Christ to St Peter. The popes are regarded as the successor of Peter, and the gold and silver keys have been significant elements in the symbolism of the Holy See since the 13th century. The gold represents spiritual power, while the silver key represents worldly power. The order of the keys on the coat of arms of Vatican City is the reverse of the coat of arms of the Holy See, in order to distinguish between the two entities. * a red cord connecting the keys. The yellow and white of the flag also refer to the keys ‚Äì in heraldic terminology, there is no distinction between yellow and gold (the metallic color or), nor between white and silver (argent). The Argent color has also been reported in relation with the white mountains of Lebanon and of the biblical city of Miye ou Miye according to the Lebanese Historian Anis Freiha. Usage The flag is displayed in many Catholic churches and institutions worldwide, often alongside the national flag of where the church or institution is located. History Oratory Church of St Aloysius Gonzaga, Oxford, with the flag of Vatican City flying at half- staff the day after the death of Pope John Paul II The Papal States traditionally used a yellow and red cockade, the traditional colors of the Roman Senate and the Roman people. However, these colors were not used on flags. In 1808 Pope Pius VII ordered the Vatican's Noble Guard and other troops to replace red color with white, in order to distinguish them from the troops that had been incorporated into Napoleon's army. In 1803, the Papal States started using a white merchant flag with the Papal coat of arms in the centre. This flag was made official on 7 June 1815. On 17 September 1825, it was replaced with a yellow and white flag which took its colours from the materials of the key (yellow for gold, white for silver). These colors were probably taken from the 1808 flag of the Palatine guard. This was the first bicolour used by the Papal States and the ancestor of the modern flag of Vatican City. The merchant flag also served as a state flag on land. Starting in 1831, the papal infantry flew square yellow and white flags. At first, they were diagonally divided, but after 1849 they were vertically divided like the merchant flag. The last infantry colour, adopted in 1862, was a plain square white and yellow flag. On 8 February 1849, while Pope Pius IX was in exile in Gaeta, a Roman Republic was declared. The new government's flag was the Italian tricolor with the motto \\"Dio e Popolo\\" on the central stripe. The papal government and its flags were restored on 2 July 1849. On 20 September 1870, the Papal States were conquered by Italy and the yellow and white flags fell out of official use. After the Lateran Treaty was signed in 1929, papal authorities decided to use the 1825 merchant flag as the state flag of the soon to be independent Vatican City state. However, the official drawing in the constitution used a drawing of the square 1862 infantry flag as a template. The treaty came into effect on 7 June 1929, and with it the newly- square Vatican flag.

He was reputedly responsible for the expulsion of his uncle the Roman king Tarquinius Superbus after the suicide of Lucretia, which led to the overthrow of the Roman monarchy. He was involved in the abdication of fellow consul Tarquinius Collatinus, and executed two of his sons for plotting the restoration of the Tarquins. He was claimed as an ancestor of the Roman gens Junia, including Decimus Junius Brutus and Marcus Junius Brutus, the most famous of Julius Caesar's assassins. Traditions about his life may have been fictional, and some scholars argue that it was the Etruscan king Porsenna who overthrew Tarquinius. The plebeian status of the Junia gens has also raised doubts about his position as a consul and the alleged initial patrician domination of the office. Depicted as the nephew of Tarquinius, he may have symbolized the internal tensions that occurred during the transition between the monarchy and the republic.  Background  Prior to the establishment of the Roman Republic, Rome had been ruled by kings. Brutus led the revolt that overthrew the last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, after the rape of the noblewoman (and kinswoman of Brutus) Lucretia at the hands of Tarquin's son Sextus Tarquinius. The account is from Livy's Ab urbe condita and deals with a point in the history of Rome prior to reliable historical records (virtually all prior records were destroyed by the Gauls when they sacked Rome under Brennus in 390 BC or 387 BC). Overthrow of the monarchy The Capitoline Brutus (now in the Capitoline Museums) is a bronze bust dated 4th to early 3rd centuries BC. It was initially thought to be a bust of Lucius Brutus (hence its name), but modern scholars have rejected this attribution. Brutus was the son of Tarquinia, daughter of Rome's fifth king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus and sister to Rome's seventh king Tarquinius Superbus. According to Livy, Brutus had a number of grievances against his uncle the king. Amongst them was the fact that Tarquinius had put to death a number of the chief men of Rome, including Brutus' brother. Brutus avoided the distrust of Tarquinius's family by feigning that he was slow-wittedLivy, Ab urbe condita, 1.56 (in Latin brutus translates to dullard). He accompanied Tarquinius's sons on a trip to the Oracle of Delphi. The sons asked the oracle which of them was going to be Rome's next king. The Oracle of Delphi responded that the first among them to kiss their mother \\"shall hold supreme sway in Rome.\\"Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.56 Brutus interpreted \\"mother\\" to mean Gaia, so he pretended to trip and kissed the ground.Davies, Norman ([1996]1998) Europe. New York NY, Harper Perennial pg. 113 Brutus, along with Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, Publius Valerius Publicola, and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus were summoned by Lucretia to Collatia after she had been raped by Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the king Tarquinius Superbus. Lucretia, believing that the rape dishonoured her and her family, committed suicide by stabbing herself with a dagger after telling of what had befallen her. According to legend, Brutus grabbed the dagger from Lucretia's breast after her death and immediately shouted for the overthrow of the Tarquins.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.58-59 The four men gathered the youth of Collatia, then went to Rome where Brutus, being at that time Tribunus Celerum, summoned the people to the forum and exhorted them to rise up against the king. The people voted for the deposition of the king, and the banishment of the royal family.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.59 Brutus, leaving Lucretius in command of the city, proceeded with armed men to the Roman army then camped at Ardea. The king, who had been with the army, heard of developments at Rome, and left the camp for the city before Brutus' arrival. The army received Brutus as a hero, and the king's sons were expelled from the camp. Tarquinius Superbus, meanwhile, was refused entry at Rome, and fled with his family into exile.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.59-60 In the aftermath following the overthrow Brutus is credited by later historians such as Tacitus as \\"establishing liberty and the consulate\\", a statement that is now believed to be false by modern historians.  The Oath of Brutus  According to Livy, Brutus' first act after the expulsion of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was to bring the people to swear an oath never to allow any man again to be king in Rome.Livy, Ab urbe condita, ed. R.S Conway & C.F. Walters (Oxford, 1914), 2.1.9. \\"The oath of Brutus\\" by Fran√ßois-Joseph Navez : : (First of all, by swearing an oath that they would suffer no man to rule Rome, it forced the people, desirous of a new liberty, not to be thereafter swayed by the entreaties or bribes of kings.) This is, fundamentally, a restatement of the 'private oath' sworn by the conspirators to overthrow the monarchy:Livy, \\"Ab urbe condita\\" 1.59.1. : : (By this guiltless blood before the kingly injustice I swear ‚Äì you and the gods as my witnesses ‚Äì I make myself the one who will prosecute, by what force I am able, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus along with his wicked wife and the whole house of his freeborn children by sword, by fire, by any means hence, so that neither they nor any one else be suffered to rule Rome.) There is no scholarly agreement that the oath took place; it is reported, although differently, by Plutarch (Poplicola, 2) and Appian (B.C. 2.119). Nevertheless, the spirit of the oath inspired later Romans including his descendant Marcus Junius Brutus. Consulship and death Brutus and Lucretia's bereaved husband, Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, were elected as the first consuls of Rome (509 BC). However, Tarquinius was soon replaced by Publius Valerius Publicola. Brutus' first acts during his consulship, according to Livy, included administering an oath to the people of Rome to never again accept a king in Rome (see above) and replenishing the number of senators to 300 from the principal men of the equites. The new consuls also created a new office of rex sacrorum to carry out the religious duties that had previously been performed by the kings.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.1-2 During his consulship the royal family made an attempt to regain the throne, firstly by their ambassadors seeking to subvert a number of the leading Roman citizens in the Tarquinian conspiracy. Amongst the conspirators were two brothers of Brutus' wife Vitellia, and Brutus' two sons, Titus Junius Brutus and Tiberius Junius Brutus. The conspiracy was discovered and the consuls determined to punish the conspirators with death. Brutus gained respect for his stoicism in watching the execution of his own sons, even though he showed emotion during the punishment. His colleague Collatinus was removed from office for his lack of harshness on the conspirators.Dionysius of Halicarnassus - Roman Antiquities 5.10Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.3-4 Tarquinius again sought to retake the throne soon after at the Battle of Silva Arsia, leading the forces of Tarquinii and Veii against the Roman army. Valerius led the infantry, and Brutus led the cavalry. Arruns Tarquinius, the king's son, led the Etruscan cavalry. The cavalry first joined battle and Arruns, having spied from afar the lictors, and thereby recognising the presence of a consul, soon saw that Brutus was in command of the cavalry. The two men, who were cousins, charged each other, and speared each other to death. The infantry also soon joined the battle, the result being in doubt for some time. The right wing of each army was victorious, the army of Tarquinii forcing back the Romans, and the Veientes being routed. However the Etruscan forces eventually fled the field, the Romans claiming the victory.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.6-7 The surviving consul, Valerius, after celebrating a triumph for the victory, held a funeral for Brutus with much magnificence. The Roman noblewomen mourned him for one year, for his vengeance of Lucretia's violation.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.7  Brutus in literature and art  David, 1789 Lucius Junius Brutus is quite prominent in English literature, and he was quite popular among British and American Whigs. A reference to L. J. Brutus is in the following lines from Shakespeare's play The Tragedie of Julius C√¶sar, (Cassius to Marcus Brutus, Act 1, Scene 2). : \\"O, you and I have heard our fathers say, : There was a Brutus once that would have brookt : Th'eternal devil to keep his state in Rome : As easily as a king.\\" One of the main charges of the senatorial faction that plotted against Julius Caesar after he had the Roman Senate declare him dictator for life, was that he was attempting to make himself a king, and a co-conspirator Cassius, enticed Brutus' direct descendant, Marcus Junius Brutus, to join the conspiracy by referring to his ancestor. L. J. Brutus is a leading character in Shakespeare's Rape of Lucrece and in Nathaniel Lee's Restoration tragedy (1680), Lucius Junius Brutus; Father of his Country. In The Mikado, the protagonist Nanki-poo refers to his father the Emperor as \\"the Lucius Junius Brutus of his race\\", for being willing to enforce his own law even if it means killing his son. The memory of L. J. Brutus also had a profound impact on Italian patriots, including those who established the ill-fated Roman Republic in February 1849. Brutus was a hero of republicanism during the Enlightenment and Neoclassical periods. In 1789, at the dawn of the French Revolution, master painter Jacques-Louis David publicly exhibited his politically charged masterwork, The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, to great controversy. The profile of Lucius Junius Brutus is on a coin that was minted by Marcus Junius Brutus following the assassination of Julius Caesar.

Biography=Early life and work= John Bell was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland. When he was 11 years old, he decided to be a scientist, and at 16 graduated from Belfast Technical High School. Bell then attended the Queen's University of Belfast, where, in 1948, he obtained a bachelor's degree in experimental physics and, a year later, a bachelor's degree in mathematical physics. He went on to complete a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Birmingham in 1956, specialising in nuclear physics and quantum field theory. In 1954, he married Mary Ross, also a physicist, whom he had met while working on accelerator physics at Malvern, UK. Bell became a vegetarian in his teen years. According to his wife, Bell was an atheist. Bell's career began with the UK Atomic Energy Research Establishment, near Harwell, Oxfordshire, known as AERE or Harwell Laboratory. In 1960, he moved to work for the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN, Conseil Europ√©en pour la Recherche Nucl√©aire), in Geneva, Switzerland. There he worked almost exclusively on theoretical particle physics and on accelerator design, but found time to pursue a major avocation, investigating the foundations of quantum theory. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1987. Also of significance during his career, Bell, together with John Bradbury Sykes, M. J. Kearsley, and W. H. Reid, translated several volumes of the ten- volume Course of Theoretical Physics of Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, making these works available to an English-speaking audience in translation, all of which remain in print. Bell was a proponent of pilot wave theory. =Bell's theorem= In 1964, after a year's leave from CERN that he spent at Stanford University, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and Brandeis University, he wrote a paper entitled \\"On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox\\". In this work, he showed that carrying forward EPR's analysis permits one to derive the famous Bell's theorem. The resultant inequality, derived from certain assumptions, is violated by quantum theory. There is some disagreement regarding what Bell's inequality‚Äîin conjunction with the EPR analysis‚Äîcan be said to imply. Bell held that not only local hidden variables, but any and all local theoretical explanations must conflict with the predictions of quantum theory: \\"It is known that with Bohm's example of EPR correlations, involving particles with spin, there is an irreducible nonlocality.\\" According to an alternative interpretation, not all local theories in general, but only local hidden variables theories (or \\"local realist\\" theories) have shown to be incompatible with the predictions of quantum theory. =Critique of von Neumann's proof= Bell's interest in hidden variables was motivated by the existence in the formalism of quantum mechanics of a \\"movable boundary\\" between the quantum system and the classical apparatus: > A possibility is that we find exactly where the boundary lies. More > plausible to me is that we will find that there is no boundary. ... The wave > functions would prove to be a provisional or incomplete description of the > quantum-mechanical part, of which an objective account would become > possible. It is this possibility, of a homogeneous account of the world, > which is for me the chief motivation of the study of the so-called 'hidden > variable' possibility. Bell was impressed that in the formulation of David Bohm's nonlocal hidden variable theory, no such boundary is needed, and it was this which sparked his interest in the field of research. Bell also criticized the standard formalism of quantum mechanics on the grounds of lack of physical precision: > For the good books known to me are not much concerned with physical > precision. This is clear already from their vocabulary. Here are some words > which, however legitimate and necessary in application, have no place in a > formulation with any pretension to physical precision: system, apparatus, > environment, microscopic, macroscopic, reversible, irreversible, observable, > information, measurement. . ... On this list of bad words from good books, > the worst of all is 'measurement'. But if he were to thoroughly explore the viability of Bohm's theory, Bell needed to answer the challenge of the so-called impossibility proofs against hidden variables. Bell addressed these in a paper entitled \\"On the Problem of Hidden Variables in Quantum Mechanics\\". (Bell had actually written this paper before his paper on the EPR paradox, but it did not appear until two years later, in 1966, due to publishing delays.) Here he showed that John von Neumann's argument does not prove the impossibility of hidden variables, as it was widely claimed, due to its reliance on a physical assumption that is not valid for quantum mechanics‚Äînamely, that the probability-weighted average of the sum of observable quantities equals the sum of the average values of each of the separate observable quantities. Bell subsequently claimed, \\"The proof of von Neumann is not merely false but foolish!\\". In this same work, Bell showed that a stronger effort at such a proof (based upon Gleason's theorem) also fails to eliminate the hidden variables program. The supposed flaw in von Neumann's proof had been previously discovered by Grete Hermann in 1935, but did not become common knowledge until after it was rediscovered by Bell. However, in 2010, Jeffrey Bub published an argument that Bell (and, implicitly, Hermann) had misconstrued von Neumann's proof, claiming that it does not attempt to prove the absolute impossibility of hidden variables, and is actually not flawed, after all. (Thus, it was the physics community as a whole that had misinterpreted von Neumann's proof as applying universally.) Bub provides evidence that von Neumann understood the limits of his proof, but there is no record of von Neumann attempting to correct the near universal misinterpretation which lingered for over 30 years and exists to some extent to this day. Von Neumann's proof does not in fact apply to contextual hidden variables, as in Bohm's theory. =Conclusions from experimental tests= In 1972 an experiment was conducted that, when extrapolated to ideal detector efficiencies, showed a violation of Bell's inequality. It was the first of many such experiments. Bell himself concluded from these experiments that \\"It now seems that the non-locality is deeply rooted in quantum mechanics itself and will persist in any completion.\\" This, according to Bell, also implied that quantum theory is not locally causal and cannot be embedded into any locally causal theory. Bell regretted that results of the tests did not agree with the concept of local hidden variables: > For me, it is so reasonable to assume that the photons in those experiments > carry with them programs, which have been correlated in advance, telling > them how to behave. This is so rational that I think that when Einstein saw > that, and the others refused to see it, he was the rational man. The other > people, although history has justified them, were burying their heads in the > sand. ... So for me, it is a pity that Einstein's idea doesn't work. The > reasonable thing just doesn't work.\\" Bell seemed to have become resigned to the notion that future experiments would continue to agree with quantum mechanics and violate his inequality. Referring to the Bell test experiments, he remarked: > It is difficult for me to believe that quantum mechanics, working very well > for currently practical set-ups, will nevertheless fail badly with > improvements in counter efficiency ...\\" Some people continue to believe that agreement with Bell's inequalities might yet be saved. They argue that in the future much more precise experiments could reveal that one of the known loopholes, for example the so-called \\"fair sampling loophole\\", had been biasing the interpretations. Most mainstream physicists are highly skeptical about all these \\"loopholes\\", admitting their existence but continuing to believe that Bell's inequalities must fail. Bell remained interested in objective 'observer-free' quantum mechanics. He felt that at the most fundamental level, physical theories ought not to be concerned with observables, but with 'be-ables': \\"The beables of the theory are those elements which might correspond to elements of reality, to things which exist. Their existence does not depend on 'observation'.\\" He remained impressed with Bohm's hidden variables as an example of such a scheme and he attacked the more subjective alternatives such as the Copenhagen interpretation. =Teaching special theory of relativity= Bell and his wife, physicist Mary Ross Bell, contributed substantially to the physics of particle accelerators, and with numerous young theorists at CERN, Bell developed particle physics itself. An overview of this work is available in the volume of collected works edited by Mary Bell, Kurt Gottfried, and Martinus Veltman. Apart from his particle physics research, Bell often raised an issue of special relativity comprehension, and although there is only one written report on this topic available (\\"How to teach special relativity\\"), this was a critical subject to him. Bell admired Einstein's contribution to special relativity, but warned in 1985 \\"Einstein's approach is ... pedagogically dangerous, in my opinion\\". In 1989 on the occasion of the centenary of the Lorentz-FitzGerald body contraction Bell writes \\"A great deal of nonsense has been written about the FitzGerald contraction\\". Bell preferred to think of Lorentz-FitzGerald contraction as a phenomenon that is real and observable as a property of a material body, which was also Einstein's opinion, but in Bell's view Einstein's approach leaves a lot of room for misinterpretation. This situation and the background of Bell's position is described in detail by his collaborator Johann Rafelski in the textbook \\"Relativity Matters\\" (2017). In order to combat misconceptions surrounding Lorentz-FitzGerald body contraction Bell adopted and promoted a relativistic thought experiment which became widely known as Bell's spaceship paradox. =Death= Blue plaque honouring John Bell at the Queen's University of Belfast Bell died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage in Geneva in 1990. It is widely claimed that, unknown to Bell, that year he had been nominated for a Nobel Prize. His contribution to the issues raised by EPR was significant. Some regard him as having demonstrated the failure of local realism (local hidden variables). Bell's own interpretation is that locality itself met its demise. Legacy *In 2008, the John Stewart Bell Prize was created by the Centre for Quantum Information and Quantum Control at the University of Toronto. The prize is awarded every other year for significant contributions first published during the six preceding years. The award recognizes major advances relating to the foundations of quantum mechanics and to the applications of these principles. In 2009, the first award was presented by Alain Aspect to Nicolas Gisin for his theoretical and experimental work on foundations and applications of quantum physics -- notably quantum nonlocality, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. *At the CERN site in Meyrin, close to Geneva, there is a street called Route Bell in honour of John Stewart Bell. *In 2016, his colleague from CERN, Reinhold Bertlmann, wrote a lengthy piece \\"Bell's Universe: A Personal Recollection\\", explaining in some detail his amazement at finding out about Bell's paper on Bertlmann's socks, in which Bell compared the EPR paradox with socks. *A day was named after him, referring to the date he released Bell's Theorem, 4 November. =Northern Ireland= *Since 2015, a street has been named Bell's Theorem Crescent in his city of birth, Belfast. *The John Bell House, named in his honour, finished construction in 2016 and houses over 400 students in Belfast city centre. *The pedestrian entrance to the Olympia leisure centre in Belfast located 200 meters from Bell's childhood home is named the \\"John Stewart Bell Entrance\\" in honour of the local man. *In the Queen's University of Belfast one of the Physics lecture theatres is named in honour of John Stewart Bell. * There is a blue plaque commemorating John Stewart Bell in Queen's university main campus * There is a blue plaque commemorating John Stewart Bell at his childhood home in Tates Avenue in Belfast Books * 2004 edition with introduction by Alain Aspect and two additional papers: .

A 19th century etching of the Tarpeian Rock. The Tarpeian Rock (; Latin: ' or '; ) is a steep cliff of the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill, overlooking the Roman Forum in Ancient Rome. It was used during the Roman Republic as an execution site. Murderers, traitors, perjurors, and larcenous slaves, if convicted by the quaestores parricidii, were flung from the cliff to their deaths.Platner (1929). A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome, Tarpeius Mons, pp509-510. London. Oxford University Press. The cliff was about 25 meters high. History According to early Roman histories, when the Sabine ruler Titus Tatius attacked Rome after the Rape of the Sabines (8th century BC), the Vestal Virgin Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, governor of the citadel on the Capitoline Hill, betrayed the Romans by opening the city gates for Titus Tatius in return for \\"what the Sabines bore on their arms\\" (golden bracelets and bejeweled rings). In Book 1 of Livy's Ab Urbe Condita, the Sabines \\"having been accepted into the citadel, [the Sabines] killed her, having been overwhelmed by weapons, and \\"\\", meaning, \\"[they] heaped up shields [on her]\\". The Sabines crushed her to death with their shields, and her body was buried in the rock that now bears her name. Regardless of whether or not Tarpeia was buried in the rock itself, it is significant that the rock was named for her deceit. About 500 BC, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh legendary king of Rome, levelled the top of the rock, removing the shrines built by the Sabines, and built the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus on the ', the area between the two summits of the hill. The rock itself survived the remodelling and was used for executions well into Sulla's time (early 1st century BC). However the execution of Simon bar Giora was as late as the time of Vespasian. There is a Latin phrase, ' ('the Tarpeian Rock is close to the Capitol'), a warning that one's fall from grace can come swiftly. To be hurled off the Tarpeian Rock was, from a certain perspective, a fate worse than mere death, because it carried with it the stigma of shame. The standard method of execution in ancient Rome was by strangulation in the Tullianum. The rock was reserved for the most notorious traitors and as a place of unofficial, extra- legal executions such as the near-execution of then-Senator Gaius Marcius Coriolanus by a mob whipped into frenzy by a tribune of the plebs. Notable victims The torture of Tarpeia. Roman Republican coinage (denarius), 89 BC. Victims of this punishment included:Plutarch, Lives; Livy, Ab Urbe Condita; M.

In lines 99-104, Sicinius Velutus gives judgement: \\"we/ Even from this instant, banish him our city,/ In peril of precipitation/ From off the rock Tarpeian, never more/ To enter our Rome gates\\". * In Asterix and the Laurel Wreath, the jailer at the Circus Maximus remarks to Asterix and Obelix that, while they are getting a gourmet feast leading up to the day they are thrown to the lions, \\"Those who are thrown from the Tarpeian Rock are given solid, heavy food\\". *In Hawthorne's The Marble Faun, a character is murdered by another character by being thrown from the Tarpeian Rock. *In Canto IX of Purgatory of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri , there is a reference to the Tarpeian Rock.

Languages that use many modal particles in their spoken form include Dutch, Danish, German, Hungarian, Russian, Telugu, Nepali, Indonesian, Chinese and Japanese.Dutch Grammar:politeness - Beleefdheid Modal particle - Modale partikels retrieved 2009-01-01 and Modal Particles By Keith Robinson, Wang Lingli retrieved 2015-08-04 The translation is often not straightforward and depends on the context. Examples=German= The German particle ja is used to indicate that a sentence contains information that is obvious or already known to both the speaker and the hearer. The sentence Der neue Teppich ist rot means \\"The new carpet is red\\". Der neue Teppich ist ja rot may thus mean \\"As we are both aware, the new carpet is red\\", which would typically be followed by some conclusion from this fact. However, if the speaker says the same thing upon first seeing the new carpet, the meaning is \\"I'm seeing that the carpet is obviously red\\", which would typically express surprise. In speech the latter meaning can be inferred from a strong emphasis on rot and higher-pitched voice. =Dutch= In Dutch, modal particles are frequently used to add mood to a sentence, especially in spoken language. For instance: * Politeness **Kan je even het licht aandoen? (literally: \\"Can you turn on the light for a short while?\\") Even here indicates that the requested action does not take much time or effort to fulfill: \\"Could you quickly turn on the light for me, please?\\" ** Weet u misschien waar het station is? (\\"Do you perhaps know where the train station is?\\") Misschien here denotes a very polite and friendly request: \\"Could you tell me the way to the train station, please?\\" ** Wil je soms wat drinken? (\\"Do you occasionally want a drink?\\") Soms here conveys a sincere interest in the answer to a question: \\"I'm curious if you would like to drink something?\\" * Frustration ** Doe het toch maar. (\\"Do it nevertheless, however.\\") Toch here indicates anger and maar lack of consideration: \\"I don't really care what you think, just do it!\\" ** Ben je nou nog niet klaar? (\\"Are you still not ready yet?\\") Nou here denotes loss of patience: \\"Don't tell me you still haven't finished!\\" Modal particles may be combined to indicate mood in a very precise way. In this combination of six modal particles the first two emphasise the command, the second two are toning down the command, and the final two transform the command into a request: * Luister dan nu toch maar eens even. (\\"Listen + at this moment + now + just + will you? + only once + only for a while\\", meaning: \\"Just Listen, will you?\\") Because of this progressive alteration these modal particles cannot move around freely when stacked in this kind of combination. However, some other modal particles can be added to the equation on any given place, such as gewoon, juist, trouwens. Also, replacing the \\"imperative weakener\\" maar by gewoon (indicating normalcy or acceptable behavior), changes the mood of the sentence completely, now indicating utter frustration with someone who is failing to do something very simple: *Luister dan nou toch gewoon eens even!

Bharatanatyam performance at Kalakshetra, during visit of Hillary Clinton, 2011 The Kalakshetra style is noted for its angular, straight, ballet-like kinesthetics, and its avoidance of Recakas and of the uninhibited throw (Ksepa) of the limbs. According to Sankara Menon (1907‚Äì2007), who was her associate from Kalakshetra's beginnings, Rukmini Devi raised Bharatanatyam to a puritan art form, divorced from its recently controversial past by \\"removing objectionable elements\\" (mostly, the Sringara, certain emotional elements evocative of the erotic, such as hip, neck, lip and chest movements) from the Pandanallur style, which was publicly criticized by Indian dancer Tanjore Balasaraswati (1918‚Äì1984) and other representatives of Tamil Nadu's traditional Isai Velalar culture. Love outside parameters considered \\"chaste\\" was not to be portrayed. Balasaraswati said that \\"the effort to purify Bharatanatyam through the introduction of novel ideas is like putting a gloss on burnished gold or painting the lotus\\". Lawyer and classical artist E. Krishna Iyer (1897‚Äì1968) said about Rukmini Devi, \\"There is no need to say that before she entered the field, the art was dead and gone or that it saw a renaissance only when she started to dance or that she created anything new that was not there before\\".

Haggard was born in Oildale, California, during the Great Depression. His childhood was troubled after the death of his father, and he was incarcerated several times in his youth. After being released from San Quentin State Prison in 1960, he managed to turn his life around and launch a successful country music career. He gained popularity with his songs about the working class that occasionally contained themes contrary to the prevailing anti-Vietnam War sentiment of much popular music of the time. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, he had 38 number-one hits on the US country charts, several of which also made the Billboard all-genre singles chart. Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s. He received many honors and awards for his music, including a Kennedy Center Honor (2010), a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (2006), a BMI Icon Award (2006), and induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1977), Country Music Hall of Fame (1994) and Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame (1997). He died on April 6, 2016 ‚Äî his 79th birthday ‚Äî at his ranch in Shasta County, California, having recently suffered from double pneumonia. Early life Haggard's parents were Flossie Mae (n√©e Harp; 1902‚Äì1984) and James Francis Haggard (1899‚Äì1946). The family moved to California from their home in Checotah, Oklahoma, during the Great Depression, after their barn burned in 1934. They settled with their two elder children, James 'Lowell' (1922‚Äì1996) and Lillian, in an apartment in Bakersfield, while James started working for the Santa Fe Railroad. A woman who owned a boxcar placed in Oildale, a nearby town, asked Haggard's father about the possibility of converting it into a house. He remodeled the boxcar, and soon after moved in, also purchasing the lot, where Merle Ronald Haggard was born on April 6, 1937. The property was eventually expanded by building a bathroom, a second bedroom, a kitchen, and a breakfast nook in the adjacent lot. His father died of a brain hemorrhage in 1946, an event that deeply affected Haggard during his childhood and the rest of his life. To support the family, his mother worked as a bookkeeper. When Merle was 12, his brother, Lowell, gave him his used guitar. Haggard learned to play alone, with the records he had at home, influenced by Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, and Hank Williams. As his mother was absent due to work, Haggard became progressively rebellious. His mother sent him for a weekend to a juvenile detention center to change his attitude, but it worsened. Haggard committed a number of minor offenses, such as thefts and writing bad checks. He was sent to a juvenile detention center for shoplifting in 1950. When he was 14, Haggard ran away to Texas with his friend Bob Teague. He rode freight trains and hitchhiked throughout the state. When he returned the same year, he and his friend were arrested for robbery. Haggard and Teague were released when the real robbers were found. Haggard was later sent to the juvenile detention center, from which he and his friend escaped again to Modesto, California. He worked a series of laborer jobs, including driving a potato truck, being a short order cook, a hay pitcher, and an oil well shooter. His debut performance was with Teague in a Modesto bar named \\"Fun Center\\", for which he was paid US$5 and given free beer. He returned to Bakersfield in 1951 and was again arrested for truancy and petty larceny and sent to a juvenile detention center. After another escape, he was sent to the Preston School of Industry, a high-security installation. He was released 15 months later but was sent back after beating a local boy during a burglary attempt. After Haggard's release, he and Teague saw Lefty Frizzell in concert. After hearing Haggard sing along to his songs backstage, Frizzell refused to sing unless Haggard was allowed to sing first. He sang songs that were well received by the audience. Because of this positive reception, Haggard decided to pursue a career in music. While working as a farmhand or in oil fields, he played in nightclubs. Married and plagued by financial issues, he was arrested in 1957 shortly after he tried to rob a Bakersfield roadhouse. He was sent to Bakersfield Jail, and after an escape attempt, was transferred to San Quentin Prison on February 21, 1958. While in prison, Haggard learned that his wife was expecting another man's child, which pressed him psychologically. He was fired from a series of prison jobs, and planned to escape along with another inmate nicknamed \\"Rabbit\\" (James KendrickThis Day in 1961; James ‚ÄòRabbit‚Äô Kendrick, friend of Merle Haggard. Crime Scribe.) but was convinced not to escape by fellow inmates. While at San Quentin, Haggard started a gambling and brewing racket with his cellmate. After he was caught drunk, he was sent for a week to solitary confinement where he encountered Caryl Chessman, an author and death-row inmate. Meanwhile, \\"Rabbit\\" had successfully escaped, only to shoot a police officer and be returned to San Quentin for execution. Chessman's predicament, along with the execution of \\"Rabbit,\\" inspired Haggard to change his life. He soon earned a high school equivalency diploma and kept a steady job in the prison's textile plant. He also played for the prison's country music band, attributing a performance by Johnny Cash at the prison on New Year's Day 1959 as his main inspiration to join it. He was released from San Quentin on parole in 1960. In 1972, after Haggard had become an established country music star, then-California governor Ronald Reagan granted Haggard a full and unconditional pardon for his past crimes. Early career Haggard depicted on a publicity portrait for Tally Records (1961, age 24) Upon his release from San Quentin in 1960, Haggard started digging ditches for his brother's electrical contracting company. Soon, he was performing again and later began recording with Tally Records. The Bakersfield sound was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced Nashville sound. Haggard's first record for Tally was \\"Singing My Heart Out\\" backed by \\"Skid Row\\"; it was not a success, and only 200 copies were pressed. In 1962, Haggard wound up performing at a Wynn Stewart show in Las Vegas and heard Wynn's \\"Sing a Sad Song.\\" He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with \\"(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers,\\" written by Liz Anderson, mother of country singer Lynn Anderson, and his career was off and running. Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson‚Äîa woman he did not know‚Äîat her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. \\"If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs. But I went anyway. She was a pleasant enough lady, pretty, with a nice smile, but I was all set to be bored to death, even more so when she got out a whole bunch of songs and went over to an old pump organ.... There they were. My God, one hit right after another. There must have been four or five number one songs there....\\" In 1967, Haggard recorded \\"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive\\" with The Strangers, also written by Liz Anderson, with her husband Casey Anderson, which became his first number-one single. When the Andersons presented the song to Haggard, they were unaware of his prison stretch. Bonnie Owens, Haggard's backup singer and then-wife, is quoted by music journalist Daniel Cooper in the liner notes to the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road: \\"I guess I didn't realize how much the experience at San Quentin did to him, 'cause he never talked about it all that much ... I could tell he was in a dark mood ... and I said, 'Is everything okay?' And he said, 'I'm really scared.' And I said, 'Why?' And he said, 'Cause I'm afraid someday I'm gonna be out there ... and there's gonna be ... some prisoner ... in there the same time I was in, stand up‚Äîand they're gonna be about the third row down‚Äîand say, 'What do you think you're doing, 45200?'\\" Cooper notes that the news had little effect on Haggard's career: \\"It's unclear when or where Merle first acknowledged to the public that his prison songs were rooted in personal history, for to his credit, he doesn't seem to have made some big splash announcement. In a May 1967 profile in Music City News, his prison record is never mentioned, but in July 1968, in the very same publication, it's spoken of as if it were common knowledge.\\" The 1967 album Branded Man with The Strangers kicked off an artistically and commercially successful run for Haggard. In 2013, Haggard biographer David Cantwell stated, \\"The immediate successors to I'm a Lonesome Fugitive‚ÄîBranded Man in 1967 and, in '68, Sing Me Back Home and The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde‚Äîwere among the finest albums of their respective years.\\" Haggard's new recordings showcased his band The Strangers, specifically Roy Nichols's Telecaster, Ralph Mooney's steel guitar, and the harmony vocals provided by Bonnie Owens. At the time of Haggard's first top-10 hit \\"(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers\\" in 1965, Owens, who had been married to Buck Owens, was known as a solo performer, a fixture on the Bakersfield club scene and someone who had appeared on television. She won the new Academy of Country Music's first ever award for Female Vocalist after her 1965 debut album, Don't Take Advantage of Me, hit the top five on the country albums chart. However, Bonnie Owens had no further hit singles, and although she recorded six solo albums on Capitol between 1965 and 1970, she became mainly known for her background harmonies on Haggard hits such as \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" and \\"Branded Man.\\" Producer Ken Nelson took a hands-off approach to produce Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: \\"The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was an exception to the rule. He called me 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty- five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me.\\" In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, \\"When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs‚Äîhe was a great writer.\\" Towards the end of the decade, Haggard composed several number- one hits, including \\"Mama Tried,\\" \\"The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde,\\" \\"Hungry Eyes,\\" and \\"Sing Me Back Home.\\" Daniel Cooper calls \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" \\"a ballad that works on so many different levels of the soul it defies one's every attempt to analyze it.\\" In a 1977 interview in Billboard with Bob Eubanks, Haggard reflected, \\"Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal, it's a feeling you never forget when you see someone you know make that last walk. They bring him through the yard, and there's a guard in front and a guard behind‚Äîthat's how you know a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out ... taking him to see the Father, ... prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind.\\" In 1969, Haggard's first tribute LP Same Train, Different Time: A Tribute to Jimmie Rodgers, was also released to acclaim. Haggard's songs attracted attention from outside the country field. The Everly Brothers covered both \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" and \\"Mama Tried\\" on their 1968 country-rock album Roots. The following year, Haggard's songs were performed or recorded by a variety of artists, including the Gram Parsons incarnation of the Byrds, who performed \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" on the Grand Ole Opry and recorded \\"Life in Prison\\" for their album Sweetheart of the Rodeo; singer-activist Joan Baez, who covered \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" and \\"Mama Tried\\"; crooner Dean Martin, who recorded \\"I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am\\" for his album of the same name; and the Grateful Dead, whose live cover of \\"Mama Tried\\" became a staple in their repertoire until the band's end in 1995. In the original Rolling Stone review for Haggard and The Strangers 1968 album Mama Tried, Andy Wickham wrote, \\"His songs romanticize the hardships and tragedies of America's transient proletarian and his success is resultant of his inherent ability to relate to his audience a commonplace experience with precisely the right emotional pitch.... Merle Haggard looks the part and sounds the part because he is the part. He's great.\\" \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" and \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\" In 1969, Haggard and The Strangers released \\"Okie From Muskogee,\\" with lyrics ostensibly reflecting the singer's pride in being from Middle America, where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority.Malone, Bill, Country Music U.S.A, 2nd rev. ed. (University of Texas Press, Austin, 2002), p. 371. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a \\"documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time.\\" However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, \\"I wrote it when I recently got out of the joint. I knew what it was like to lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt.\\" In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: \\"My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee', while at the same time listening to radio shows of The World Tomorrow (radio and television) hosted by Garner Ted Armstrong. Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'\\", as it was the subject of this Garner Ted Armstrong radio program. \\"And a week or so later, I was listening to Garner Ted Armstrong, and Armstrong was saying how the smaller colleges in smaller towns don't seem to have any problems. And I wondered if Muskogee had a college, and it did, and they hadn't had any trouble - no racial problems and no dope problems. The whole thing hit me in two minutes, and I did one line after another and got the whole thing done in 20 minutes.\\" In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, \\"That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was.\\" Haggard began performing the song in concert in 1969 and was astounded at the reaction it received: The studio version, which was mellower than the usually raucous live-concert versions, topped the country charts in 1969 and remained there for a month. It also hit number 41 on the Billboard all-genre singles chart, becoming Haggard's biggest hit up to that time, surpassed only by his 1973 crossover Christmas hit, \\"If We Make It Through December,\\" which peaked at number 28. \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" is also generally described as Haggard's signature song. On his next single, \\"The Fightin' Side of Me,\\" released by his record company in 1970 over Haggard's objections, Haggard's lyrics stated that he did not mind the counterculture \\"switchin' sides and standin' up for what they believe in,\\" but resolutely declared, \\"If you don't love it, leave it!\\" In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, \\"I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like.... What do they have to offer humanity?\\" In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, \\"I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [more]. I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and a lot of things that I said [then] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and I think anybody that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information. It's a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed.\\" Haggard had wanted to follow \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" with \\"Irma Jackson,\\" a song that dealt with an interracial romance between a white man and an African American woman. His producer, Ken Nelson, discouraged him from releasing it as a single. Jonathan Bernstein recounts, \\"Hoping to distance himself from the harshly right-wing image he had accrued in the wake of the hippie-bashing \\"Muskogee,\\" Haggard wanted to take a different direction and release \\"Irma Jackson\\" as his next single.... When the Bakersfield, California, native brought the song to his record label, executives were reportedly appalled. In the wake of \\"Okie,\\" Capitol Records was not interested in complicating Haggard's conservative, blue-collar image.\\" After \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\" was released, instead, Haggard later commented to the Wall Street Journal, \\"People are narrow-minded. Down South they might have called me a nigger lover.\\" In a 2001 interview, Haggard stated that Nelson, who was also head of the country division at Capitol at the time, never interfered with his music, but \\"this one time he came out and said, 'Merle, I don't believe the world is ready for this yet.' ... And he might have been right. I might've canceled out where I was headed in my career.\\" \\"Okie From Muskogee,\\" \\"The Fightin' Side of Me,\\" and \\"I Wonder If They Think of Me\\" (Haggard's 1973 song about an American POW in Vietnam) were hailed as anthems of the Silent Majority and have been recognized as part of a recurring patriotic trend in American country music that also includes Charlie Daniels' \\"In America\\" and Lee Greenwood's \\"God Bless the USA.\\" Although Gordon Friesen of Broadside magazine criticized Haggard for his \\"[John] Birch-type songs against war dissenters,\\" Haggard was popular with college students in the early 1970s, not only because of the ironic use of his songs by counterculture members, but also because his music was recognized as coming from an early country-folk tradition. Both \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" and \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\" received extensive airplay on underground radio stations, and \\"Okie\\" was performed in concert by protest singers Arlo Guthrie and Phil Ochs. Later career Haggard depicted on a publicity portrait for Capitol Records (1975, age 38) Haggard's 1970 LP A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World, dedicated to Bob Wills, helped spark a permanent revival and expanded the audience for western swing. By this point, Haggard was one of the most famous country singers in the world, having enjoyed an immensely successful artistic and commercial run with Capitol, accumulating 24 number-one country singles since 1966. In 1972, Let Me Tell You about A Song, the first TV special starring Haggard, was nationally syndicated by Capital Cities TV Productions. It was a semi-autobiographical musical profile of Haggard, akin to the contemporary Behind The Music, produced and directed by Michael Davis. The 1973 recession anthem, \\"If We Make It Through December,\\" furthered Haggard's status as a champion of the working class. \\"If We Make It Through December\\" turned out to be Haggard and The Strangers last crossover pop hit. Haggard appeared on the cover of TIME on May 6, 1974. He also wrote and performed the theme song to the television series Movin' On, which in 1975 gave him and The Strangers another number-one country hit. During the early to mid-1970s, Haggard and The Strangers country chart domination continued with songs such as \\"Someday We'll Look Back,\\" \\"Grandma Harp,\\" \\"Always Wanting You,\\" and \\"The Roots of My Raising.\\" Between 1973 and 1976, he and The Strangers scored nine consecutive number-one country hits. In 1977, he switched to MCA Records and began exploring the themes of depression, alcoholism, and middle age on albums such as Serving 190 Proof and The Way I Am. Haggard sang a duet cover of Billy Burnette's \\"What's A Little Love Between Friends\\" with Lynda Carter in her 1980 television music special, Lynda Carter: Encore! He also scored a number-one hit in 1980 with \\"Bar Room Buddies,\\" a duet with actor Clint Eastwood that appeared on the Bronco Billy soundtrack. Haggard appeared in an episode of The Waltons entitled \\"The Comeback,\\" season five, episode three, original air-date October 10, 1976. He played a bandleader named Red, who had been depressed since the death of his son (Ron Howard). In 1981, Haggard published an autobiography, Sing Me Back Home. The same year, he alternately spoke and sang the ballad \\"The Man in the Mask.\\" Written by Dean Pitchford, whose other work includes \\"Fame,\\" \\"Footloose,\\" \\"Sing,\\" \\"Solid Gold,\\" and the musical Carrie, this was the combined narration and theme for the movie The Legend of the Lone Ranger, a box-office flop. Haggard also changed record labels again in 1981, moving to Epic and releasing one of his most critically acclaimed albums, Big City, on which he was backed by The Strangers. Between 1981 and 1985, Haggard scored 12 more top-10 country hits, with nine of them reaching number one, including \\"My Favorite Memory,\\" \\"Going Where the Lonely Go,\\" \\"Someday When Things Are Good,\\" and \\"Natural High.\\" In addition, Haggard recorded two chart-topping duets with George Jones‚Äî\\"Yesterdays' Wine\\" in 1982‚Äîand with Willie Nelson‚Äî\\"Pancho and Lefty\\" in 1983. Nelson believed the 1983 Academy Award-winning film Tender Mercies, about the life of fictional singer Mac Sledge, was based on the life of Merle Haggard. Actor Robert Duvall and other filmmakers denied this and claimed the character was based on nobody in particular. Duvall, however, said he was a big fan of Haggard's. In 1983, Haggard and his third wife Leona Williams divorced after five stormy years of marriage. The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who spent much of the next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems. Haggard has stated that he was in his own mid-life crisis, or \\"male menopause,\\" around this time. He said in an interview from this period: \\"Things that you've enjoyed for years don't seem nearly as important, and you're at war with yourself as to what's happening. 'Why don't I like that anymore? Why do I like this now?' And finally, I think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another.... Your body is getting ready to die and your mind doesn't agree.\\" He was briefly a heavy user of cocaine but managed to kick the habit. Despite these issues, he won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance for his 1984 remake of \\"That's The Way Love Goes.\\" Haggard was hampered by financial woes well into the 1990s, as his presence on the charts diminished in favor of newer country singers, such as George Strait and Randy Travis. Haggard's last number-one hit was \\"Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Star\\" from his smash album Chill Factor in 1988. In 1989, Haggard recorded a song, \\"Me and Crippled Soldiers Give a Damn,\\" in response to the Supreme Court's decision not to allow banning flag burning, considering it to be \\"speech\\" and therefore protected under the First Amendment. After CBS Records Nashville avoided releasing the song, Haggard bought his way out of the contract and signed with Curb Records, which was willing to release the song. Haggard commented about the situation, \\"I've never been a guy that can do what people told me.... It's always been my nature to fight the system.\\" Comeback upright In 2000, Haggard made a comeback of sorts, signing with the independent record label Anti and releasing the spare If I Could Only Fly to critical acclaim. He followed it in 2001 with Roots, vol. 1, a collection of Lefty Frizzell, Hank Williams, and Hank Thompson covers, along with three Haggard originals. The album, recorded in Haggard's living room with no overdubs, featured Haggard's longtime bandmates, The Strangers, as well as Frizzell's original lead guitarist, Norman Stephens. In December 2004, Haggard spoke at length on Larry King Live about his incarceration as a young man and said it was \\"hell\\" and \\"the scariest experience of my life.\\" When political opponents were attacking the Dixie Chicks for criticizing President George W. Bush's 2003 invasion of Iraq, Haggard spoke up for the band on July 25, 2003, saying: Haggard and The Strangers number-one hit single \\"Mama Tried\\" is featured in the 2003 film Radio with Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ed Harris, as well as in Bryan Bertino's The Strangers with Liv Tyler. In addition, his and The Strangers song \\"Swingin' Doors\\" can be heard in the film Crash (2004), and his 1981 hit \\"Big City\\", where he is backed by The Strangers, is heard in Joel and Ethan Coen's film Fargo. In October 2005, Haggard released his album Chicago Wind to mostly positive reviews. The album contained an anti-Iraq war song titled \\"America First,\\" in which he laments the nation's economy and faltering infrastructure, applauds its soldiers, and sings, \\"Let's get out of Iraq, and get back on track.\\" This follows from his 2003 release \\"Haggard Like Never Before\\" in which he includes a song, \\"That's The News.\\" Haggard released a bluegrass album, The Bluegrass Sessions, on October 2, 2007. In 2008, Haggard was going to perform at Riverfest in Little Rock, Arkansas, but the concert was canceled because he was ailing, and three other concerts were canceled, as well. However, he was back on the road in June and successfully completed a tour that ended on October 19, 2008. In April 2010, Haggard released a new album, I Am What I Am, to strong reviews, and he performed the title song on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in February 2011. Collaborations Haggard collaborated with many other artists over the course of his career. In the early 1960s, Haggard recorded duets with Bonnie Owens, who later became his wife, for Tally Records, scoring a minor hit with \\"Just Between the Two of Us.\\" As part of the deal that got Haggard signed to Capitol, producer Ken Nelson obtained the rights to Haggard's Tally sides, including the duets with Owens, resulting in the release of Haggard's first duet album with Owens and The Strangers in 1966, also entitled Just Between the Two of Us. The album reached number four on the country charts, and Haggard and Owens recorded a number of additional duets before their divorce in 1978. Haggard went on to record duets with George Jones, Willie Nelson, and Clint Eastwood, among others. In 1970, Haggard released A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World (or, My Salute to Bob Wills), rounding up six of the remaining members of the Texas Playboys to record the tribute: Johnnie Lee Wills, Eldon Shamblin, Tiny Moore, Joe Holley, Johnny Gimble, and Alex Brashear. Merle's band, The Strangers, were also present during the recording, but Wills suffered a massive stroke after the first day of recording. Merle arrived on the second day, devastated that he would not get to record with him, but the album helped return Wills to public consciousness, and set off a Western swing revival. Haggard did other tribute albums to Bob Wills over the next 40 years. In 1973 he appeared on For the Last Time: Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys. In 1994, Haggard collaborated with Asleep at the Wheel and many other artists influenced by the music of Bob Wills on an album entitled A Tribute To The Music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. A Tribute was re-released on CD on the Koch label in 1995. In 1972, Haggard agreed to produce Gram Parsons's first solo album but backed out at the last minute. Warner Bros. arranged a meeting at Haggard's Bakersfield home and the two musicians seemed to hit it off, but later on the afternoon of the first session, Haggard canceled. Parsons, an enormous Haggard fan, was crushed, with his wife Gretchen telling Meyer, \\"Merle not producing Gram was probably one of the greatest disappointments in Gram's life. Merle was very nice, very sweet, but he had his own enemies and his own demons.\\" In 1980, Haggard said of Parsons, in an interview with Mark Rose, \\"He was a pussy. Hell, he was just a long-haired kid. I thought he was a good writer. He was not wild, though. That's what's funny to me. All these guys running around in long hair talking about being wild and Rolling Stones. I don't think someone abusing themselves on drugs determines how wild they are. It might determine how ignorant they are.\\" In 1982, Haggard recorded A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with George Jones, an album that produced two top-10 hits, including the number-one \\"Yesterday's Wine\\". In 2006, the pair released a sequel, Kickin' Out the Footlights...Again. Haggard released the duet album Pancho & Lefty with Willie Nelson in 1983, with the title track becoming an enormous hit for the duo. In 1987, a second, less successful LP, Seashores of Old Mexico, was also released, and the pair worked together again with Ray Price in 2007, releasing the album Last of the Breed. In 2015, they released their sixth and final duet album, Django and Jimmie. The album's lead single, \\"It's All Going to Pot\\", was a subtle reference to smoking marijuana, and the music video for the song showed Haggard and Nelson smoking joints while singing in a recording studio. In 1983, Haggard got permission from Epic Records to collaborate with then-wife Leona Williams on Polydor Records, releasing Heart to Heart in 1983. The album, on which they were backed by The Strangers, was not a hit, peaking at number 44. In 2001, Haggard released an album of gospel songs with Albert E. Brumley called Two Old Friends. In 2002, Haggard collaborated with longtime friend and fellow recording artist Chester Smith (founder of television broadcasting company Sainte Partners II, L.P. and owner of several stations in California and Oregon) with a CD titled California Blend.Review , AllMusic.com; accessed August 17, 2016. The CD features classic country, western, and gospel tracks performed by both Smith and Haggard. In 2005, Haggard was featured as a guest vocalist on Gretchen Wilson's song \\"Politically Uncorrect\\", which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. He is also featured singing a verse on Eric Church's 2006 song \\"Pledge Allegiance to the Hag.\\" In 2005, Haggard was featured as a guest vocalist on Blaine Larsen's song \\"If Merle Would Sing My Song.\\" In 2015, Haggard was featured as a guest vocalist on Don Henley's song \\"The Cost of Living\\" on the album Cass County. In 2017, Haggard appeared alongside Willie Nelson in the award-winning documentary The American Epic Sessions directed by Bernard MacMahon. They performed a song Haggard had composed for the film, \\"The Only Man Wilder Than Me\\" and Bob Wills' classic \\"Old Fashioned Love\\", which they recorded live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. It was the last filmed performance of the pair, with Rolling Stone commenting \\"in the final performance of Sessions, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard perform the duet \\"The Only Man Wilder Than Me.\\" Haggard has a look of complete joy on his face throughout the session in the old-timey recording set-up once used by his musical heroes.\\" Haggard's last recording, a song called \\"Kern River Blues,\\" described his departure from Bakersfield in the late 1970s and his displeasure with politicians. The song was recorded February 9, 2016, and features his son Ben on guitar. This record was released on May 12, 2016.Merle Haggard's last song released , rollingstone.com; accessed August 17, 2016. Equipment Haggard endorsed Fender guitars and had a Custom Artist signature model Telecaster.

He also played six-string acoustic models. In 2001, C. F. Martin & Company introduced a limited edition Merle Haggard Signature Edition 000-28SMH acoustic guitar available with or without factory-installed electronics. Personal life=Wives and children= Haggard was married five times, first to Leona Hobbs from 1956 to 1964. They had four children: Dana, Marty, Kelli, and Noel. Shortly after divorcing Hobbs, in 1965, he married singer Bonnie Owens. Haggard credited her with helping him make his big break as a country artist. He shared the writing credit with Owens for his hit \\"Today I Started Loving You Again\\" and acknowledged, including on stage, that the song was about a sudden burst of special feelings he experienced for her while they were touring together. She also helped care for Haggard's children from his first marriage and was the maid of honor for Haggard's third marriage. Haggard and Owens divorced in 1978 but remained close friends as Owens continued as his backing vocalist until her death in 2006. In 1978, Haggard married Leona Williams. In 1983, they divorced. In 1985 Haggard married Debbie Parret; they divorced in 1991. He married his fifth wife, Theresa Ann Lane, on September 11, 1993. They had two children, Jenessa and Ben. =Cigarette and drug use= Haggard said he started smoking marijuana when he was 41 years old. He admitted that in 1983, he bought \\"$2,000 (worth) of cocaine\\" and partied for five months afterward, when he said he finally realized his condition and quit for good. He quit smoking cigarettes in 1991, and stopped smoking marijuana in 1995. However, a Rolling Stone magazine interview in 2009 indicated that he had resumed regular marijuana smoking. =Illness and death= Haggard underwent angioplasty in 1995 to unblock clogged arteries. On November 9, 2008, it was announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer in May and undergone surgery on November 3, during which part of his lung was removed.Haggard returned home on November 8. Less than two months after his cancer surgery, he played two shows on January 2 and 3, 2009, in Bakersfield at Buck Owens Crystal Palace, and continued to tour and record until shortly before his death. On December 5, 2015, Haggard was treated at an undisclosed hospital in California for pneumonia. He made a recovery, but postponed several concerts. In March 2016, Haggard was once again hospitalized. His concerts for April were canceled due to his ongoing double pneumonia. On the morning of April 6, 2016, his 79th birthday, he died of complications from pneumonia at his home in Palo Cedro, Shasta County, California. Haggard was buried in a private funeral at his ranch on April 9, 2016; longtime friend Marty Stuart officiated.Merle Haggard was laid to rest on Saturday , hallels.com; accessed August 17, 2016. =Loss of material = On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Merle Haggard among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Legacy and honors Haggard at the White House for the 2010 Kennedy Center Honors During his long career, Haggard received numerous awards from the Academy of Country Music, Country Music Association, and National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (Grammy Awards) (see Awards). He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1977, the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in 1994, and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2006, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and was also honored as a BMI Icon at the 54th annual BMI Pop Awards that same year. During his songwriting career up to that time, Haggard had earned 48 BMI Country Awards, nine BMI Pop Awards, a BMI R&B; Award, and 16 BMI \\"Million-Air\\" awards, all from a catalog of songs that added up to over 25 million performances. Haggard accepted a Kennedy Center Honor on December 4, 2010, from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in recognition of his lifetime achievement and \\"outstanding contribution to American culture.\\" The following day, he was honored at a gala in Washington, DC, with musical performances by Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Sheryl Crow, Vince Gill, Jamey Johnson, Kid Rock, Miranda Lambert, and Brad Paisley. This tribute was featured on the December 28, 2010, CBS telecast of the Kennedy Center Honors. In July 2007, a three-and-a-half-mile stretch of 7th Standard Road in Oildale, California, where Haggard grew up, was renamed Merle Haggard Drive in his honor. It stretches from North Chester Avenue west to U.S. Route 99 and provides access to the William M. Thomas airport terminal at Meadows Field Airport. Haggard played two shows to raise money to pay for the changes in road signage. In 2015, the converted boxcar in which the Haggard family lived in Oildale was moved to the Kern County Museum for historic preservation and restoration. On November 6, 2013, the mayor of Winchester, Virginia, awarded Haggard the Key to the City at the Patsy Cline Theatre after a sold-out show by Bonnie Blue Concerts. On June 14, 2013, the California State University, Bakersfield, awarded Haggard the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts. Haggard stepped to the podium and said, \\"Thank you. It's nice to be noticed.\\" On January 26, 2014, Haggard performed his 1969 song \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards along with Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and Blake Shelton. =Influence= Haggard's guitar playing and voice gave his country songs a hard-edged, blues-like style in many cuts. Although he was outspoken in his dislike for modern country music, he praised George Strait, Toby Keith, and Alan Jackson. Haggard also had an interest in jazz music, and stated in an interview in 1986 that he wanted to be remembered as \\"the greatest jazz guitar player in the world that loved to play country.\\" Keith has singled out Haggard as a major influence on his career. Merle Haggard Drive, Oildale, California As noted by an article published in The Washington Post upon Haggard's death, \\"Respect for the Hag [Haggard] as an icon, both for his musical status and his personal views, is a common theme\\" in country music. Many country music acts have paid tribute to Haggard by mentioning him in their songs (a fact aided by his first name rhyming with \\"girl,\\" a common theme in country songs). These include: * The Dixie Chicks paid tribute to Haggard by recording Darrell Scott's song \\"Long Time Gone,\\" which criticizes Nashville trends: \\"We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin'/But the music ain't got no soul/ Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard,\\" with the following lines mentioning Johnny Cash and Hank Williams in the same vein. * Collin Raye recorded \\"My Kind of Girl,\\" which includes the line, \\"How 'bout some music/She said have you got any Merle/That's when I knew she was my kind of girl.\\" * In 2000, Alan Jackson and George Strait sang \\"Murder on Music Row,\\" which criticizes mainstream country trends: \\"The Hag wouldn't have a chance on today's radio/Because they committed murder down on music row.\\" * In 2005, the country rock duo Brooks & Dunn sang \\"Just Another Neon Night\\" off their Hillbilly Deluxe album. In the song, Ronnie Dunn said, \\"He's got an Eastwood grin and a Tulare swagger/Hollerin' turn off that rap/And play me some Haggard.\\" Brooks and Dunn also reference Haggard in 1993's \\"Rock My World (little country girl)\\" off their Hard Workin' Man album as they sing \\"Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle/Rock my world little country girl.\\" * Red Simpson mentions Haggard and Buck Owens in his 1971 song \\"I'm a Truck,\\" which contains the line, \\"Well, I know what he's gonna do now/Take out that tape cartridge of Buck Owens and play it again/I dunno why he don't get a Merle Haggard tape.\\" * In 2005, Shooter Jennings mentioned Haggard in the title track of his album Put the \\"O\\" Back in Country and later mentioned him in 2007 in his song \\"Concrete Cowboys.\\" * In 2006, Hank Williams III included Haggard, as well as other country icons, in the song \\"Country Heroes.\\" * LeAnn Rimes mentions him in her 2013 song, \\"I Do Now\\": \\"Thank God for Merle Haggard, he's right, the bottle let me down.\\" * \\"You Never Even Called Me by My Name,\\" written by Steve Goodman and performed by David Allan Coe, mentions Haggard and his song \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\" along with references to Waylon Jennings and Charley Pride. * George Jones mentions \\"The Okie from Muskogee\\" in his song \\"Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes.\\" * Gretchen Wilson's song \\"Politically Uncorrect\\" and Eric Church's song \\"I Pledge Allegiance to the Hag\\" both contain tributes to Haggard, as well as featuring him as a guest vocalist. *Country singer David Nail references the Haggard song \\"Mama Tried\\" in the lyrics to his song \\"The Sound of a Million Dreams\\" from his 2011 album of the same name: \\"...when I hear Mama Tried I still break down and cry And pull to the side of the road ...\\". The song was written by Phil Vassar & Scooter Carusoe. * In John Anderson's song \\"Honky Tonk Saturday Night\\", he sings the lines, \\"I went to the jukebox and played some Merle Haggard/Oh me and the waitress think he's outta sight\\". * Cody Johnson centralizes Merle in his song \\"Monday Morning Merle,\\" with a reference in the chorus \\"...turns up 'Misery and Gin,' here we are again - Monday Morning Merle.\\" In the 1970s, several rock acts responded in their own songs to Haggard's criticism of hippie counterculture in \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" and \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\". The Youngbloods answered \\"Okie from Muskogee\\" with \\"Hippie from Olema\\", in which, in one repetition of the chorus, they change the line, \\"We still take in strangers if they're ragged\\" to \\"We still take in strangers if they're haggard.\\" Nick Gravenites, of Big Brother and the Holding Company, paid Haggard a tongue-in-cheek tribute with the song, \\"I'll Change Your Flat Tire, Merle,\\" later covered by other artists including Pure Prairie League. Despite these critiques, the Grateful Dead performed \\"Mama Tried\\" over 300 times, and \\"Sing Me Back Home\\" approximately 40 times. The Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd more respectfully referenced Haggard in their song, \\"Railroad Song,\\" which contains the lyric, \\"Well I'm a ride this train Lord until I find out/What Jimmie Rodgers and the Hag was all about.\\" Skynyrd also performed both a cover of \\"Honky Tonk Night Time Man\\" and their own take on the song with \\"Jacksonville Kid\\" (found on the 2001 CD reissue of the album) on their album Street Survivors. He described himself as a student of music, philosophy, and communication. He would discuss jazzman Howard Roberts guitar playing, life after death and the unique speaking technique of Garner Ted Armstrong of The World Tomorrow with enthusiasm and authority. =Television acting= Merle appeared in season five, episode three of The Waltons called \\"The Comeback\\". He played Red Turner, a local musician who had become depressed and withdrawn after the death of his son, played by Ron Howard, in the episode called \\"The Gift\\".

Watercolour painting by Edward H. Cree (1814‚Äì1901), Naval Surgeon to the Royal Navy. The Opium Wars were two wars waged between the Qing dynasty and Western powers in the mid-19th century. The First Opium War, fought in 1839‚Äì1842 between the Qing and the United Kingdom, was triggered by the dynasty's campaign against the opium trade; the Second Opium War was fought between the Qing and Britain and France, 1856‚Äì1860. In each war, the European forces used recently developed military technology to defeat the Qing forces, and compelled the government to grant favorable tariffs, trade concessions, and territory. The wars and the subsequently-imposed treaties weakened the Qing dynasty and Chinese governments, and forced China to open specified treaty ports (especially Shanghai and Guangzhou (Canton)) that handled all trade with imperial powers. The resulting concession of Hong Kong after the wars compromised China's territorial sovereignty. Around this time China's economy also contracted slightly, but the sizable Taiping Rebellion and Dungan Revolt had a much larger effect. First Opium War Chin-Kiang-Foo (Zhenjiang), 21 July 1842, effecting the defeat of the Manchu government. Watercolour by military illustrator Richard Simkin (1840‚Äì1926). The First Opium War began in 1839 and was fought over trading rights, financial reparations, and diplomatic status. In the eighteenth century, China enjoyed a favourable trade balance with Europe, selling porcelains, silk, and tea in exchange for silver. In the late 18th century, the British East India Company expanded cultivation of opium in its Indian Bengal territories, selling it to private traders who transported it to China and passed it on to Chinese smugglers. By 1787, the Company was sending 4,000 chests of opium (each 77 kg) per year. In earlier times, opium was taken as a relatively harmless medicine, but the new practice of smoking opium recreationally increased demand tremendously and often led to addiction. The Chinese Jiaqing Emperor issued edicts making opium illegal in 1729, 1799, 1814, and 1831, but imports grew as smugglers and colluding officials gorged on the profits. Some Americans entered the trade by smuggling opium from Turkey into China, including the grandfather of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and ancestors of Secretary of State John Forbes Kerry. By 1833, the opium traffic soared to 30,000 chests. The East India Company sent opium to their warehouses in the free-trade region of Canton (Guangzhou), and sold it to Chinese smugglers.Haythornthwaite, Philip J., The Colonial Wars Source Book, London, 2000, p.237. In 1834, the East India Company's monopoly on the China trade ceased, and the illegal opium trade burgeoned. Partly concerned with the moral decay of the people and partly with the outflow of silver, the Emperor charged High Commissioner Lin Tse-hsu with ending the trade. In 1839, Commissioner Lin published in Canton, but did not send, an open Letter To Queen Victoria pleading for a halt to the opium contraband. Lin ordered the seizure of all opium in Canton, including that held by foreign governments and trading companies (called factories),Haythornthwaite, 2000, p.237. and the companies prepared to hand over a token amount to placate him. Charles Elliot, Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China, arrived 3 days after the expiry of Lin's deadline, as Chinese soldiers enforced a shutdown and blockade of the factories. The standoff ended after Elliot paid for all the opium on credit from the British Government (despite lacking official authority to make the purchase) and handed the 20,000 chests (1,300 metric tons) over to Lin, who had them destroyed at Humen. Charles Elliott then wrote to London advising the use of military force against the Chinese. A small skirmish occurred between British and Chinese vessels in the Kowloon Estuary on 4 September 1839. After almost a year, the British government decided, in May 1840, to send troops to impose reparations for the financial losses of the British traders in Canton and to guarantee future security for trade. On 21 June 1840 a British naval force arrived off Macao and moved to bombard the port of Dinghai. In the ensuing conflict, the Royal Navy used its superior ships and guns to inflict a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire.Tsang, Steve (2007). A Modern History of Hong Kong. I. B. Tauris. pp. 3‚Äì13, 29. . The war was concluded by the Treaty of Nanking (Nanjing) in 1842, the first of Unequal Treaties between China and Western powers.Treaty of Nanjing inBritannica. The treaty forced China to cede in perpetuity the Hong Kong Island and surrounding smaller islands to the United Kingdom, and it established five treaty ports at Shanghai, Canton, Ningpo (Ningbo), Foochow (Fuzhou), and Amoy (Xiamen).Haythornthwaite 2000, p. 239. The treaty also imposed a twenty-one million dollar payment to Great Britain, with six million, paid immediately and the rest through specified instalments thereafter.Treaty Of Nanjing (Nanking), 1842 on the website of the US-China Institute at University of Southern Carolina. Another treaty the following year gave most favoured nation status to the British Empire and added provisions for British extraterritoriality. France secured the same concessions in treaties of 1843 and 1844. Second Opium War 1860 battle of Taku Forts. Book illustration from 1873. In 1853, northern China was convulsed by the Taiping Rebellion, which established its capital at Nanking. In spite of this, a new Imperial Commissioner Ye Mingchen was appointed at Canton, determined to stamp out the opium trade, which was still technically illegal. In October 1856 he seized the Arrow, a ship claiming British registration, and threw its crew into chains. Sir John Bowring, Governor of British Hong Kong, called up Admiral Sir Michael Seymour's fleet which on 23 October bombarded and captured the Pearl River forts on the approach to Canton, and proceeded to bombard Canton itself, but had insufficient forces to take and hold the city. On 15 December, during a riot in Canton, European commercial properties were set on fire and Bowring appealed for military intervention. The murder of a French missionary inspired support from France. The European allies, including Britain, France, and the Russian Empire, now sought greater concessions from China, including legalization of the opium trade, expansion of the transport of coolies (cheap labourers), opening all China to British merchants and opium traffickers, and exempting foreign imports from internal transit duties. The war resulted in the Treaty of Tientsin (26 June 1858), which forced the Chinese to pay reparations for the expenses of the recent war, open a second group of ten ports to European commerce, legalize the opium trade, and grant foreign traders and missionaries rights to travel within China. After a second phase of fighting which included the sack of the Old Summer Palace and the occupation of the Forbidden City palace complex in Beijing, the Treaty was confirmed by the Convention of Peking in 1860.

In one, the player moves around the screen, collecting dollar bills and avoiding red tape; this represents maximizing income for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the other phase has the player move around to manage his investments while another sprite oscillates between an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent, a certified public accountant (CPA), and an investment advisor. If the player is caught by the IRS agent, he is audited, and always loses the audit, which takes 50% of his income. If he encounters the CPA, he is charged a fee but gains new tax- sheltered investment options. If he encounters the investment advisor, he can maximize his tax-sheltered investment returns.

References to black people, their social condition during the 19th & 20th century, and their spiritual place in Western Christianity as well as in Mormon scripture was complicated. From the beginning, black people have been members of Mormon congregations, and Mormon congregations have always been interracial. When the Mormons migrated to Missouri, they encountered the pro-slavery sentiments of their neighbors. Joseph Smith upheld the laws regarding slaves and slaveholders, and affirmed the curse of Ham as placing his descendants into slavery, \\"to the shame and confusion of all who have cried out against the South.\\" After the Mormons were expelled from Missouri, Smith took an increasingly strong anti-slavery position, and several black men were ordained to the LDS priesthood. New York era (1820s and early 1830s) The first reference to dark skin as a curse and mark from God in Latter Day Saint writings can be found in the Book of Mormon, published in 1830. It refers to a group of people called the Lamanites and states that when they rebelled against God they were cursed with \\"a skin of blackness\\" (). The mark of blackness was placed upon the Lamanites so the Nephites \\"might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction\\" (). The Book of Mormon records the Lord as forbidding miscegenation between Lamanites and Nephites () and saying they were to stay \\"separated from thee and thy seed [Nephites], from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them\\" (). However, states: \\"[The Lord] inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come, black and white, bond and free, male and female...and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.\\" Although the Lamanites are labelled as wicked, they actually became more righteous than the Nephites as time passed (). Throughout the Book of Mormon narrative, several groups of Lamanites did repent and lose the curse. The Anti-Nephi-Lehies or Ammonites \\"open[ed] a correspondence with them [Nephites], and the curse of God did no more follow them\\" (). There is no reference to their skin color being changed. Later, the Book of Mormon records that an additional group of Lamanites converted and that \\"their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites‚Ä¶ and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites\\" (). The curse was also put on others who rebelled. One group of Nephites, called Amlicites \\"had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should fall upon them\\". () The Amlicites then put a mark upon themselves. At this point, the author stops the narrative to say \\"I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own condemnation.\\"() Eventually, the Lamanites \\"had become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.\\" () The Book of Mormon did not countenance any form of curse-based discrimination. It stated that the Lord \\"denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile\\". (). In fact, prejudice against people of dark skin was condemned more than once, as in this example: > O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their > skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before > the throne of God. Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the > word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of > their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their > filthiness... (). Missouri era (early 1830s to 1838) In the summer of 1833 W. W. Phelps published an article in the church's newspaper, seeming to invite free black people into the state to become Mormons, and reflecting \\"in connection with the wonderful events of this age, much is doing towards abolishing slavery, and colonizing the blacks, in Africa.\\"Phelps, W.W. (July 1833), p. 109 Outrage followed Phelps' comments, (Roberts [1930] 1965, p. 378.) and he was forced to reverse his position, which he claimed was \\"misunderstood\\", but this reversal did not end the controversy, and the Mormons were violently expelled from Jackson County, Missouri five months later in December 1833.Bush & Mauss 1984, p. 55 In 1835, the Church issued an official statement indicating that because the United States government allowed slavery, the Church would not \\"interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men.\\" (D&C; ). On February 6, 1835, an assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote a letter theorizing that the curse of Cain survived the deluge by passing through the wife of Ham, son of Noah, who according to Phelps was a descendant of Cain. (Messenger and Advocate 1:82) In addition, Phelps introduced the idea of a third curse upon Ham himself for \\"marrying a black wife\\". (Messenger and Advocate 1:82) This black wife, according to Phelps, was not just a descendant of Cain, but one of the pre-flood \\"people of Canaan\\", not directly related to the Biblical Canaanites after the flood. In 1836, the rules established by the church for governing assemblies in the Kirtland Temple included attendees who were \\"bond or free, black or white.\\" (History of the Church, Vol. 2, Ch. 26, p. 368) Writing for the Messenger and Advocate newspaper on the subject of slavery, Joseph Smith states: In April 1836, Smith said: In 1836, Warren Parrish (Smith's secretary) wrote regarding the sentiments of the people of Kirtland: The Church never denied membership based on race (although slaves had to have their master's permission to be baptized), and several black men were ordained to the priesthood during Joseph Smith's lifetime. The first known black Latter-day Saint was \\"Black Pete\\", who joined the Church in Kirtland, Ohio, and there is evidence that he held the priesthood.Bringhurst, Newell G. Chapter 4: Elijah Abel and the Changing Status of Blacks Within Mormonism, Bush & Mauss 1984. Other African Americans, including Elijah Abel in 1832, Joseph T. Ball in 1835 or 1836 (who also presided over the Boston Branch from 1844‚Äì1845), and Walker Lewis in 1843 (and probably his son, Enoch Lovejoy Lewis), were ordained to the priesthood during Smith's lifetime. William McCary was ordained in Nauvoo in 1846 by Apostle Orson Hyde. Two of the descendants of Elijah Abel were also ordained Elders, and two other black men, Samuel Chambers and Edward Leggroan, were ordained Deacons. Early black members in the Church were admitted to the temple in Kirtland, Ohio, where Elijah Abel received the ritual of washing and anointing (see Journal of Zebedee Coltrin ). Abel also participated in at least two baptisms for the dead in Nauvoo, Illinois, as did Elder Joseph T. Ball. Nauvoo era prior to Smith's death (1838 to 1844) In 1838, Joseph Smith had the following conversation: In 1838, and throughout the 19th century the term \\"species\\" was borrowed and commonly used to imply that the black population was inferior. The biological use of the term species was first defined in 1686. In 1838, Joseph Smith answered the following question while en route from Kirtland to Missouri, as follows: \\"Are the Mormons abolitionists? No ... we do not believe in setting the Negroes free.\\" (Smith 1977, p. 120) By 1839 there were about a dozen black members in the Church. Nauvoo, Illinois was reported to have 22 black members, including free and slave, between 1839‚Äì1843 (Late Persecution of the Church of Latter-day Saints, 1840). Beginning in 1842, Smith made known his increasingly strong anti-slavery position. In March 1842, he began studying some abolitionist literature, and stated, \\"it makes my blood boil within me to reflect upon the injustice, cruelty, and oppression of the rulers of the people. When will these things cease to be, and the Constitution and the laws again bear rule?\\" (History of the Church, 4:544). On February 7, 1844, Joseph Smith wrote his views as a candidate for president of the United States. The anti-slavery plank of his platform called for a gradual end to slavery by the year 1850 . His plan called for the government to buy the freedom of slaves using money from the sale of public lands. Notable Black members of the early LDS movement=Elijah Abel= Although Joseph Smith is not known to have made any statements regarding blacks and the priesthood, he was aware of the ordination of at least one black man to the office of elder. Elijah Abel was ordained on 3 March 1836 by Zebedee Coltrin. Six months later, he was ordained to the office of seventy and was called to serve in the Third Quorum of the Seventy. Abel served his first mission for the church to New York and Upper Canada. In 1836, he moved from Kirtland to Nauvoo, Illinois, where he participated in the temple ordinance of baptism for the dead. In 1843, a traveling high council visited Cincinnati, where Abel lived, but refused to recognize Abel for the sake of public appearance and called him to his second mission to the \\"colored population\\" of Cincinnati.Bush & Mauss 1984, p. 130 Abel joined the other Latter-day Saints in Utah Territory in 1853. By then, Brigham Young had formalized church's policies against black people. However, no attempt was made to remove Abel's priesthood or drop him from the Third Quorum of the Seventy. He remained active in the Quorum until his death. =Green Flake= Born in 1829 Green Flake, the slave of James Madison Flake, a convert to the LDS Church, was baptized at the age of 16 on April 7, 1844 by John Brown. He accompanied the Flake family to Nauvoo, Illinois. Green remained a slave but was a member of the church throughout his life. From family diaries and the memory of a grandson, it is believed that it was Green who drove the carriage and team that brought President Brigham Young into the Salt Lake Valley. Brigham Young freed Flake in 1854.Green Flake, BlackLDS.org =Walker Lewis= Walker Lewis was another free black man who held the Mormon priesthood prior to the death of Joseph Smith. A prominent radical abolitionist, Episcopalian, and Most Worshipful Grand Master of Freemasonry from Lowell and Boston, Massachusetts, Lewis became a Latter Day Saint about 1842. In the summer of 1843, he was ordained an elder in the Melchizedek priesthood. His son, Enoch Lovejoy Lewis, also joined the Latter Day Saints about the same time, and Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier heard young Enoch preaching in Lowell just after the death of Joseph Smith in July or August 1844. It has been speculated that Enoch led Young to instigate the ban against black men holding Mormon priesthood when Enoch L. Lewis married a white Mormon woman, Mary Matilda Webster, in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 18, 1846 . On December 3, 1847, Young told the Quorum of the Twelve at Winter Quarters that \\"if they [Enoch and Matilda] were far away from the Gentiles they wod. [would] all be killed ‚Äì when they mingle seed it is death to all.\\" (Quorum of the Twelve Minutes, December 3, 1847, pp. 6‚Äì7, LDS Archives.)

A GHZ experiment is similar to a test of Bell's inequality, except using three or more entangled particles, rather than two. With specific settings of GHZ experiments, it is possible to demonstrate absolute contradictions between the predictions of local hidden variable theory and those of quantum mechanics, whereas tests of Bell's inequality only demonstrate contradictions of a statistical nature. The results of actual GHZ experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics. The GHZ experiments are named for Daniel M. Greenberger, Michael A. Horne, and Anton Zeilinger (GHZ) who first analyzed certain measurements involving four observers and who subsequently (together with Abner Shimony (GHSZ), upon a suggestion by David Mermin) applied their arguments to certain measurements involving three observers. and references therein Summary description and example A GHZ experiment is performed using a quantum system in a Greenberger‚ÄìHorne‚ÄìZeilinger state. An exampleA. Zeilinger, Dance of the Photons, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 2010, pp. 218‚Äì223. of a GHZ state is three photons in an entangled state, with the photons being in a superposition of being all horizontally polarized (HHH) or all vertically polarized (VVV), with respect to some coordinate system. Prior to any measurements being made, the polarizations of the photons are indeterminate; If a measurement is made on one of the photons using a two-channel polarizer aligned with the axes of the coordinate system, the photon assumes either horizontal or vertical polarization, with 50% probability for each orientation, and the other two photons immediately assume the identical polarization. In a GHZ experiment regarding photon polarization, however, a set of measurements is performed on the three entangled photons using two- channel polarizers set to various orientations relative to the coordinate system. For specific combinations of orientations, perfect (rather than statistical) correlations between the three polarizations are predicted by both local hidden variable theory (aka \\"local realism\\") and by quantum mechanical theory, and the predictions may be contradictory. For instance, if the polarization of two of the photons are measured and determined to be rotated +45¬∞ from horizontal, then local hidden variable theory predicts that the polarization of the third photon will also be +45¬∞ from horizontal. However, quantum mechanical theory predicts that it will be +45¬∞ from vertical. The results of actual experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics, not those of local realism. Detailed technical example=Preliminary considerations= Frequently considered cases of GHZ experiments are concerned with observations obtained by three measurements, A, B, and C, each of which detects one signal at a time in one of two distinct mutually exclusive outcomes (called channels): for instance A detecting and counting a signal either as (A‚Üë) or as (A‚Üì), B detecting and counting a signal either as (B ¬´) or as (B ¬ª), and C detecting and counting a signal either as (C ‚óä) or as (C ‚ô¶). Signals are to be considered and counted only if A, B, and C detect them trial-by-trial together; i.e. for any one signal which has been detected by A in one particular trial, B must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial, and C must have detected precisely one signal in the same trial; and vice versa. For any one particular trial it may be consequently distinguished and counted whether * A detected a signal as (A‚Üë) and not as (A‚Üì), with corresponding counts nt (A‚Üë) = 1 and nt (A‚Üì) = 0, in this particular trial t, or * A detected a signal as (A‚Üì) and not as (A‚Üë), with corresponding counts nf (A‚Üë) = 0 and nf (A‚Üì) = 1, in this particular trial f, where trials f and t are evidently distinct; similarly, it can be distinguished and counted whether * B detected a signal as (B ¬´) and not as (B ¬ª), with corresponding counts ng (B ¬´) = 1 and ng (B ¬ª) = 0, in this particular trial g, or * B detected a signal as (B ¬ª) and not as (B ¬´), with corresponding counts nh (B ¬´) = 0 and nh (B ¬ª) = 1, in this particular trial h, where trials g and h are evidently distinct; and correspondingly, it can be distinguished and counted whether * C detected a signal as (C ‚óä) and not as (C ‚ô¶), with corresponding counts n l(C ‚óä) = 1 and n l(C ‚ô¶) = 0, in this particular trial l, or * C detected a signal as (C ‚ô¶) and not as (C ‚óä), with corresponding counts nm(C ‚óä) = 0 and nm(C ‚ô¶) = 1, in this particular trial m, where trials l and m are evidently distinct. For any one trial j it may be consequently distinguished in which particular channels signals were detected and counted by A, B, and C together, in this particular trial j; and correlation numbers such as : p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( j ) = (nj (A‚Üë) ‚àí nj (A‚Üì)) (nj (B ¬´) ‚àí nj (B ¬ª)) (nj (C ‚óä) ‚àí nj (C ‚ô¶)) can be evaluated in each trial. Following an argument by John Stewart Bell, each trial is now characterized by particular individual adjustable apparatus parameters, or settings of the observers involved. There are (at least) two distinguishable settings being considered for each, namely A's settings a1 , and a2 , B's settings b1 , and b2 , and C's settings c1 , and c2 . Trial s for instance would be characterized by A's setting a2 , B's setting b2 , and C's settings c2 ; another trial, r, would be characterized by A's setting a2 , B's setting b2 , and C's settings c1 , and so on. (Since C's settings are distinct between trials r and s, therefore these two trials are distinct.) Correspondingly, the correlation number p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( s ) is written as p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( a2 , b2 , c2 ), the correlation number p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( r ) is written as p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( a2 , b2 , c1 ) and so on. Further, as GHZ and collaborators demonstrate in detail, the following four distinct trials, with their various separate detector counts and with suitably identified settings, may be considered and be found experimentally: * trial s as shown above, characterized by the settings a2 , b2 , and c2 , and with detector counts such that *: p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( s ) = (ns (A‚Üë) ‚àí ns (A‚Üì)) (ns (B ¬´) ‚àí ns (B ¬ª)) (ns (C ‚óä) ‚àí ns (C ‚ô¶)) = ‚àí1, * trial u with settings a2 , b1 , and c1 , and with detector counts such that *: p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( u ) = (nu (A‚Üë) ‚àí nu (A‚Üì)) (nu (B ¬´) ‚àí nu (B ¬ª)) (nu (C ‚óä) ‚àí nu (C ‚ô¶)) = 1, * trial v with settings a1 , b2 , and c1 , and with detector counts such that *: p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( v ) = (nv (A‚Üë) ‚àí nv (A‚Üì)) (nv (B ¬´) ‚àí nv (B ¬ª)) (nv (C ‚óä) ‚àí nv (C ‚ô¶)) = 1, and * trial w with settings a1 , b1 , and c2 , and with detector counts such that *: p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( w ) = (nw (A‚Üë) ‚àí nw (A‚Üì)) (nw (B ¬´) ‚àí nw (B ¬ª)) (nw (C ‚óä) ‚àí nw (C ‚ô¶)) = 1. The notion of local hidden variables is now introduced by considering the following question: Can the individual detection outcomes and corresponding counts as obtained by any one observer, e.g. the numbers (nj (A‚Üë) ‚àí nj (A‚Üì)), be expressed as a function A( ax , Œª ) (which necessarily assumes the values +1 or ‚àí1), i.e. as a function only of the setting of this observer in this trial, and of one other hidden parameter Œª, but without an explicit dependence on settings or outcomes concerning the other observers (who are considered far away)? Therefore: can the correlation numbers such as p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( ax , bx , cx ), be expressed as a product of such independent functions, A( ax , Œª ), B( bx , Œª ) and C( cx , Œª ), for all trials and all settings, with a suitable hidden variable value Œª? Comparison with the product which defined p(A‚Üë) (B ¬´) (C ‚óä)( j ) explicitly above, readily suggests to identify * Œª ‚Üí j, * A( ax , j ) ‚Üí (nj (A‚Üë) ‚àí nj (A‚Üì)), * B( bx , j ) ‚Üí (nj (B ¬´) ‚àí nj (B ¬ª)), and * C( cx , j ) ‚Üí (nj (C ‚óä) ‚àí nj (C ‚ô¶)), where j denotes any one trial which is characterized by the specific settings ax , bx , and cx , of A, B, and of C, respectively. However, GHZ and collaborators also require that the hidden variable argument to functions A(), B(), and C() may take the same value, Œª, even in distinct trials, being characterized by distinct experimental contexts. This is the statistical independence assumption (also assumed in Bell's theorem and commonly known as \\"free will\\" assumption). Consequently, substituting these functions into the consistent conditions on four distinct trials, u, v, w, and s shown above, they are able to obtain the following four equations concerning one and the same value Œª: # A( a2 , Œª ) B( b2 , Œª ) C( c2 , Œª ) = ‚àí1, # A( a2 , Œª ) B( b1 , Œª ) C( c1 , Œª ) = 1, # A( a1 , Œª ) B( b2 , Œª ) C( c1 , Œª ) = 1, and # A( a1 , Œª ) B( b1 , Œª ) C( c2 , Œª ) = 1. Taking the product of the last three equations, and noting that A( a1 , Œª ) A( a1 , Œª ) = 1, B( b1 , Œª ) B( b1 , Œª ) = 1, and C( c1 , Œª ) C( c1 , Œª ) = 1, yields : A( a2 , Œª ) B( b2 , Œª ) C( c2 , Œª ) = 1 in contradiction to the first equation; 1 ‚â† ‚àí1. Given that the four trials under consideration can indeed be consistently considered and experimentally realized, the assumptions concerning hidden variables which lead to the indicated mathematical contradiction are therefore collectively unsuitable to represent all experimental results; namely the assumption of local hidden variables which occur equally in distinct trials. =Deriving an inequality= Since equations (1) through (4) above cannot be satisfied simultaneously when the hidden variable, Œª, takes the same value in each equation, GHSZ proceed by allowing Œª to take different values in each equation. They define * Œõ1: the set of all Œªs such that equation (1) holds, * Œõ2: the set of all Œªs such that equation (2) holds, * Œõ3: the set of all Œªs such that equation (3) holds, * Œõ4: the set of all Œªs such that equation (4) holds. Also, Œõic is the complement of Œõi. Now, equation (1) can only be true if at least one of the other three is false. Therefore, : Œõ1 ‚äÜ Œõ2c ‚à™ Œõ3c ‚à™ Œõ4c. In terms of probability, : p(Œõ1) ‚â§ p(Œõ2c ‚à™ Œõ3c ‚à™ Œõ4c). By the rules of probability theory, it follows that : p(Œõ1) ‚â§ p(Œõ2c) + p(Œõ3c) + p(Œõ4c). This inequality allows for an experimental test. =Testing the inequality= To test the inequality just derived, GHSZ need to make one more assumption, the \\"fair sampling\\" assumption. Because of inefficiencies in real detectors, in some trials of the experiment only one or two particles of the triple will be detected. Fair sampling assumes that these inefficiencies are unrelated to the hidden variables; in other words, the number of triples actually detected in any run of the experiment is proportional to the number that would have been detected if the apparatus had no inefficiencies - with the same constant of proportionality for all possible settings of the apparatus. With this assumption, p(Œõ1) can be determined by choosing the apparatus settings a2 , b2 , and c2 , counting the number of triples for which the outcome is -1, and dividing by the total number of triples observed at that setting. The other probabilities can be determined in a similar manner, allowing a direct experimental test of the inequality. GHSZ also show that the fair sampling assumption can be dispensed with if the detector efficiencies are at least 90.8%.

The special was later released on DVD on September 2, 2008 as a bonus feature on Warner Home Video's remastered deluxe DVD of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.Charlie Brown/Peanuts Specials DVD news: Rear Box Art for It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown: Remastered Deluxe Edition  TVShowsOnDVD.com Plot Snoopy takes a book out from the library ‚Äì on Charlie Brown's card ‚Äì and the book is about magic tricks, which inspires Snoopy to hold a magic show, taking the stage name \\"The Great Houndini\\", using Marcie and Sally as his assistants. In the show, once Snoopy silences a kid heckling his \\"Woodstock-out-of-the-hat\\" trick, he does the \\"stick-in-the-hole\\" trick to Franklin, the \\"amputation-decapitation\\" trick to Peppermint Patty, cutting Linus' trademark security blanket into strips, the \\"levitation\\" trick to Lucy Van Pelt, and biggest of all, making Charlie Brown literally disappear. Unfortunately, a sudden rainstorm ends the show early, and Charlie Brown is left invisible. Convinced he's going to remain that way for the rest of his life, he prepares to \\"roam the world as a lost soul\\", and Sally begins moving her stuff into his room. When Snoopy realizes he can't yet reverse the trick, he tries a couple of different ideas to make Charlie Brown somewhat visible again, including draping a sheet over his head, which scares Sally, and causes Charlie Brown to faint when he sees himself in the mirror. Meanwhile, Snoopy tries working on reversing the invisible trick, but still has trouble with it even after seeing his supper dish floating in mid-air. While Snoopy searches for a counterspell, Charlie Brown realizes he has a golden opportunity to kick Lucy's infamous football without her usual pulling- away prank. Taking advantage of his invisibility, Charlie Brown finally kicks the ball out of Lucy's hand and taunts her about it. Lucy is at a loss to know what is going on as she can only hear Charlie Brown's voice. But when he tries another attempt, Snoopy casts the counterspell to make him visible again just as he runs toward the football, and this time Lucy does her usual prank, with Charlie Brown again landing flat on his back. Nevertheless, Charlie Brown is happy that he finally kicked the ball at least once with Snoopy as a witness. When Lucy scoffs at Snoopy, the insulted beagle magically levitates Lucy into the sky, and leaves her stuck there for payback. Snoopy and Charlie Brown happily laugh and dance away to conclude a satisfying day, while Linus eventually pulls Lucy down with his blanket.

They have released five studio albums, and have sold over 5 million units worldwide. The band's cover of Michael Jackson's \\"Smooth Criminal\\" topped the Billboard Alternative songs charts in 2001, and was featured in the film American Pie 2. They released their debut album Greatest Hits independently in 1999, then signed to DreamWorks Records in 2000. Their second album ANThology was released in 2001 and has been certified platinum by the RIAA, selling over one million copies and reaching number 11 on the Billboard 200. Following up that was their third album, TruANT, released in 2003. The album was produced by brothers Robert and Dean DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots, and made it to 42 on the Billboard 200. In 2005 the band recorded the next album 3rd Draft, however the album's release was denied by the label after Geffen bought out DreamWorks. It was eventually released in 2006 as Up in the Attic, charting at number 114 on the Billboard 200. After several years of sporadic touring, the band's fifth studio album Always and Forever was released in February 2015. History=Early years (1996‚Äì2000)= The band was formed in 1996 in Riverside, California. The original lineup consisted of Dryden Mitchell (vocals), Terry Corso (guitars), Mike Cosgrove (drums) and Tye Zamora (bass). Their name comes from an idea original guitarist Terry Corso had about aliens and the Earth: \\"it was just my daydream about our planet being seeded by entities from other dimensions.\\" In 1996 they recorded a demo tape entitled the $100 EP containing five songs, and in 1998 they recorded a second demo tape Love Songs, featuring four songs. In 1999, Alien Ant Farm released their debut album, titled Greatest Hits that featured a first version of \\"Smooth Criminal\\". It went on to win Best Independent Album in the L.A. Music Awards that year. In 2000, after forging a friendship with the band Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm signed with Dreamworks SKG for their second studio album, Anthology. They proceeded to tour with Papa Roach to support the album. =ANThology (2001‚Äì2002)= Alien Ant Farm in 2001 In 2001, their cover of Michael Jackson's song, \\"Smooth Criminal\\", was a No. 1 single in Australia and New Zealand, a No. 3 single in the UK, and No. 1 on the US Modern Rock charts. The music video features numerous homages to Michael Jackson and his videos. Terry Corso, the band's guitarist, addressed this in an MTV interview on the set of the music video, saying, \\"We want to pay homage to Michael Jackson, but on our level. Obviously we're not that glitzy, so we just want to tastefully take the stuff that's cool in his videos and apply it in our own dirty little backyard way.\\" The song appeared on the soundtrack of the first season of WWE Tough Enough and in the film American Pie 2. Their following single \\"Movies\\" was a Top 5 hit in the UK and a Top 20 hit in New Zealand. The band began touring in promotion of these two singles and their album, which later went platinum. In spring of 2002, the band contributed \\"Bug Bytes\\" to the first Spider-Man soundtrack. In May 2002, the band was involved in a bus accident while touring in Spain. While the whole band suffered minor injuries, the driver, 26-year-old Christopher Holland, was killed, and lead singer Dryden Mitchell suffered a fractured C2 vertebra. =TruANT (2003‚Äì2004)= Alien Ant Farm soon returned to the studio to work on their next album, Truant, which was released in 2003 and produced by Stone Temple Pilots' Robert and Dean DeLeo. The video for \\"These Days\\", the first single from the album, was filmed on top of a nearby building during the Red Carpet at the 2003 BET Awards. \\"Glow\\" was a mainstream radio success, achieving long lasting Top 20 success in New Zealand. Two months after this album was released, however, their record label closed its doors. This hindered the album's popularity over time, and the album was much less successful than their platinum selling d√©but. In October 2003, guitarist Terry Corso split with the band citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\". Victor Camacho (a long time friend of the band and guitar player) immediately joined the band and completed the remainder of the Truant tour until the band returned home. Joe Hill was named the new guitarist in 2005 (formerly in Spiderworks). In 2004, the band recorded the song \\"Dark in Here\\" for The Punisher video game. The band was forced to wait for Geffen to allow them to record another album (after Universal Music bought DreamWorks and assigned the band to its Geffen Records label). =3rd Draft and Up in the Attic (2005‚Äì2007)= In 2005, the band recorded with producer Jim Wirt (who recorded their independent, debut release Greatest Hits) and planned to release the album during that summer. However, Geffen shelved the album and subsequently denied the band the rights to release it themselves. The band hit the road and made bootleg copies of the album material available to all of their fans. This unofficial release was dubbed 3rd Draft by fans. Four video games have featured the band's songs. Their song \\"Wish\\" was in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, while the song \\"Courage\\" also featured in Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder and ATV Offroad Fury 2. The song \\"These Days\\" was featured in Madden NFL 2004 and the song \\"S.S Recognize\\" were featured in NHL 2004. In late 2005, Geffen finally agreed to let the band release the album on another Universal label, Universal Music Enterprises (its catalog division). On May 30, 2006 the new album, Up in the Attic, was released digitally on iTunes and sold at various retailers. The Best Buy Edition included a bonus track, \\"Repeat Defender\\". The first single was \\"Forgive and Forget\\", the one added track to 3rd Draft. In April 2006, bassist Tye Zamora left the band and decided to go to college. The short amount of live shows thereafter featured Alex Barreto on bass. On June 29, 2006, the band performed on G4's Attack of the Show, and on July 18, 2006, Up In The Attic was released worldwide, along with BUSted: The Definitive DVD. Included on the DVD were music videos for \\"Forgive and Forget\\", \\"Around the Block\\", and \\"She's Only Evil\\". Notably, the three videos feature only Dryden Mitchell and Mike Cosgrove. The band released \\"Around the Block\\", the second single from Up in the Attic, on the iTunes Store in 2007. =Rejoining of Zamora and Corso (2007‚Äì2010)= On February 11, 2008, the band posted a statement on their website stating Terry Corso and Tye Zamora had rejoined the band. It was also revealed that the band had \\"unofficially broken up\\" in 2007 due to the fact that 2006's Up in the Attic was their least successful album. Around this time, vocalist Dryden Mitchell formed a new band, Send the Sages. Guitarist Terry Corso and drummer Michael Cosgrove worked on a side project titled Ghost In The Flesh, bassist Tye Zamora worked with the band eEnik. Alien Ant Farm toured sporadically, and released a new live album, Alien Ant Farm: Live In Germany. In 2009, they played the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, UK on August 1. They had also performed \\"Smooth Criminal\\" at the 2009 Vans' Warped Tour in memory of Michael Jackson, who had recently died. On February 9, 2010, Alien Ant Farm posted on their official website that the original line up (Dryden Mitchell, Terry Corso, Tye Zamora and Mike Cosgrove) was back together for the first time since 2003. On February 27, 2010, the Alien Ant Farm official website released the band's first \\"webizode\\" titled Bassmasters. =Always And Forever and upcoming sixth studio album (2011‚Äìpresent)= Alien Ant Farm playing in 2015. The band's \\"ANTicipation\\" 2011 Tour took place across the continental U.S. from July to October 2011. They also took part in the \\"Michael Forever Tribute Concert\\" which took place on October 8, 2011 in Cardiff, Wales. Alien Ant Farm started writing new material and in July 2012 started recording their fifth album, Always and Forever, at Groovemaster Studios in Chicago in July 2012. In March 2013 they set up a crowdfund, using PledgeMusic, to finance the album's release. The first single from Always and Forever, \\"Let 'Em Know\\", was released in May 2013. Also in the summer of 2013, Alien Ant Farm participated in \\"The Big Night Out Tour\\", opening for Hoobastank and Fuel. Founding member and bassist Tye Zamora left Alien Ant Farm in March 2014 and was replaced by Tim Peugh. At the same time Michael Anaya joined as a touring member of the band, providing backing vocals, percussion, and keyboards. Another single, Homage, was released in September 2014, followed a month later by E.P. Phone Home. The album Always and Forever was released on February 24, 2015. On March 31, 2016, Alien Ant Farm announced on their official Facebook page that they were writing material for a new album. On May 17, 2016, the band took part in the Make America Rock Again super tour throughout the summer and fall 2016. In addition, they announced a headlining tour where they intend to perform the album Anthology in its entirety. In 2018 they toured as part of the \\"Gen-X Tour\\", alongside Buckcherry, P.O.D., and Lit. On May 8, 2020, the new single \\"Everything she wants\\" was released digitally on streaming services. It is a cover of the song by Wham!. Musical style and influences Although initially grouped in with the nu metal movement of the late 90s and early 2000s, the band's sound also crosses over into other genres, such as alternative rock, alternative metal, punk rock, and pop punk. Spin stated in 2003 that their hit cover of Michael Jackson's \\"Smooth Criminal\\" proved that \\"nu metal could be funny on purpose\\". The band's influences include Faith No More and Primus.

He is best known for his travel novels set on one hand in the American Old West with Winnetou and Old Shatterhand as main protagonists and on the other hand in the Orient and Middle East with Kara Ben Nemsi and Hadschi Halef Omar. May also wrote novels set in Latin America and Germany, poetry, a play, and composed music; he was a proficient player of several musical instruments. Many of his works were adapted for film, stage, audio dramas and comics. Later in his career, May turned to philosophical and spiritual genres. He is one of the best-selling German writers of all time, with about 200,000,000 copies worldwide.  Life and career  The house in which May was born = Youth = May was the fifth child of a poor family of weavers in Ernstthal, Sch√∂nburgische Rezessherrschaften (then part of the Kingdom of Saxony). He had 13 siblings, of whom nine died in infancy. During his school years, he received instruction in music and composition. At 12, May was making money at a skittle alley, where he was exposed to rough language.May K. Mein Leben und Streben (My Life and Aspirations) Karl May, 2014 in German , 9786050342987. = Delinquency = In 1856, May commenced teacher training in Waldenburg but in 1859 was expelled for stealing six candles. After an appeal, he was allowed to continue in Plauen. Shortly after graduation, when his roommate accused him of stealing a watch, May was jailed in Chemnitz for six weeks and his license to teach was permanently revoked. After this, May worked with little success as a private tutor, an author of tales, a composer and a public speaker. For four years, from 1865 to 1869, May was jailed in the workhouse at Osterstein Castle, Zwickau. With good behaviour, May became an administrator of the prison library which gave him the chance to read widely. He made a list of the works he planned to write (Repertorium C. May.) On his release, May continued his life of crime, impersonating various characters (policemen, doctors etc.) and spinning fantastic tales as a method of fraud. He was arrested, but when he was transported to a crime scene during a judicial investigation, he escaped and fled to Bohemia, where he was detained for vagrancy. For another four years, from 1870 to 1874, May was jailed in Waldheim, Saxony. There he met a Catholic Catechist, Johannes Kochta, who assisted May.M. Bugmann, Savage To Saint: The Karl May Story (2016). = Early years as a writer = After his release in May 1874, May returned to his parents' home in Ernstthal and began to write. In November 1874, Die Rose von Ernstthal (\\"The Rose from Ernstthal\\") was published.Sudhoff D. and Steinmetz H. Karl-May-Chronik Karl-May-Verlag, 2006. , 9783780201706. May then became an editor in the publishing house of Heinrich Gotthold M√ºnchmeyer in Dresden. May managed entertainment papers such as Schacht und H√ºtte (\\"Mine and Mill\\") and continued to publish his own works such as Geographische Predigten (\\"Collected Travel Stories\\") (1876). May resigned in 1876 and was employed by Bruno Radelli of Dresden. In 1878, May became a freelance writer. In 1880, he married Emma Pollmer. Once again, May was insolvent. In 1882, May returned to the employ of M√ºnchmeyer and began the first of five large colportage novels. One of these was Das Waldr√∂schen (1882‚Äì1884). From 1879, May was also published in Deutscher Hausschatz (\\"German House Treasure\\"), a Catholic weekly journal from the press of Friedrich Pustet in Regensburg. In 1880, May began the Orient Cycle, which ran, with interruption, until 1888. May was also published in the teenage boys' journal Der Gute Kamerad (\\"The Good Comrade\\") of Wilhelm Spemann, Stuttgart. In 1887, it published Der Sohn des B√§renj√§gers (\\"Son of the Bear Hunter\\"). In 1891 Der Schatz im Silbersee (\\"The Treasure of Silver Lake\\") was published. May published in other journals using pseudonyms. In all, he published over one hundred articles. In October 1888, May moved to K√∂tzschenbroda (a part of Radebeul) and 1891 to Villa Agnes in Oberl√∂√ünitz. In 1891, Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld offered to print the Deutscher Hausschatz \\"Son of the Bear Hunter\\" stories as books. In 1892, the publication of Carl May's Gesammelte Reiseromane (Collected Travel Accounts or Karl May's Gesammelte Reiseerz√§hlungen) brought financial security and recognition. May became deeply absorbed in the stories he wrote and the lives of his characters. Readers wrote to May, addressing him as the protagonists of his books. May conducted talking tours in Germany and Austria and allowed autographed cards to be printed and photos in costume to be taken. In December 1895, May moved to the Villa Shatterhand in Alt-Radebeul, which he purchased from the Ziller brothers.Bugmann, Savage To Saint: The Karl May Story (2016). = Later career = Karl May and Sascha Schneider, 1904 Tomb of Karl and Klara May In 1899, May traveled to Egypt then Sumatra with his servant, Sejd Hassan. In 1900, he was joined by Klara and Richard Pl√∂hn. The group returned to Radebeul in July 1900. May demonstrated some emotional instability during his travels.Bartsch E. and Wollschl√§ger H.

Hermann Cardauns and Rudolf Lebius criticised May for his self-promotion with the Old Shatterhand legend. He was also reproached for his writing for the Catholic Deutscher Hausschatz and several Marian calendars. There were also charges of unauthorised book publications and the use of an illegal doctoral degree. In 1902, May did receive a Doctor honoris causa from the Universitas Germana-Americana, Chicago for Im Reiche des Silbernen L√∂wen (\\"In the Realm of the Silver Lion.\\")Heermann C. Winnetous Blutsbruder: Karl-May-Biografie. Zweite, √ºberarbeitete und erg√§nzte Auflage. Karl-May-Verlag, Bamberg / Radebeul 2012. , 9783780201614. p. 425‚àí427. In 1908, Karl and Klara May spent six weeks in North America. They traveled through Albany, New York, Buffalo, New York, the Niagara Falls and visited friends in Lawrence, Massachusetts. May was inspired to write Winnetou IV. However, on his return, May began work on complex allegorical texts. He considered the \\"question of mankind\\", pacifism and the raising of humans from evil to good. Sascha Schneider provided symbolistic covers for the Fehsenfeld edition. On 22 March 1912, May was invited by the Academic Society for Literature and Music in Vienna to present a lecture entitled Empor ins Reich der Edelmenschen (\\"Upward to the Realm of Noble Men\\"). There, he met Bertha von Suttner. Karl May died one week later in his own Villa Shatterhand on 30 March 1912. According to the register of deaths, the cause was cardiac arrest, acute bronchitis and asthma, but according to Ralf Harder from the Karl-May- Stiftung, May's death certificate does not include the cause of death.http://www.bild.de/regional/dresden/karl-may/karl-may-starb-an- blei-45126002.bild.html Scientists examining the remains of May in 2014 found excessive quantities of lead and other heavy metals, and concluded that his death was probably due to a long-time exposure to lead in water as well as tobacco. May was buried in Radebeul East. His tomb was inspired by the Temple of Athena Nike.  Works = Introduction = May used many pseudonyms, including \\"Capitan Ramon Diaz de la Escosura\\", \\"D. Jam\\", \\"Emma Pollmer\\", \\"Ernst von Linden\\", \\"Hobble-Frank\\", \\"Karl Hohenthal\\", \\"M. Gisela\\", \\"P. van der L√∂wen\\", \\"Prinz Muhamel Lautr√©amont\\" and \\"Richard Pl√∂hn\\". Most pseudonymously or anonymously published works have been identified. For the novels set in America, May created the characters of Winnetou, the wise chief of the Apaches and Old Shatterhand, Winnetou's white blood brother. Another series of novels were set in the Ottoman Empire. In these, the narrator-protagonist, Kara Ben Nemsi, travels with his local guide and servant Hadschi Halef Omar through the Sahara desert to the Near East, experiencing many exciting adventures. May's writing developed from the anonymous first-person observer-narrator (for example Der Gitano, 1875) to a narrator with heroic skills and equipment, to a fully formed first-person narrator-hero. With few exceptions, May had not visited the places he described, but he compensated successfully for his lack of direct experience through a combination of creativity, imagination, and documentary sources including maps, travel accounts and guidebooks, as well as anthropological and linguistic studies. The work of writers such as James Fenimore Cooper, Gabriel Ferry, Friedrich Gerst√§cker, Balduin M√∂llhausen and Mayne Reid served as his models. Non-dogmatic Christian values play an important role in May's works. Some of the characters are described as being of German, particularly Saxon, origins. In a letter to a young Jew who intended to become a Christian after reading May's books, May advised him first to understand his own religion, which he described as holy and exalted, until he was experienced enough to choose.May K. Letter to Herbert Friedl√§nder (13 April 1906) in Wohlgschaft H. Karl May, Leben und Werk, Buecherhaus Bargfeld, Germany, 2005 p1555f. . In his later works (after 1900) May left the adventure fiction genre to write symbolic novels with religious and pacifistic content. The change is best shown in Im Reiche des silbernen L√∂wen, where the first two parts are adventurous and the last two parts belong to the mature work. = Early work = In his early work, May wrote in a variety of genres until he showed his proficiency in travel stories.Lowsky M. Karl May Metzler, Stuttgart, 1987, vol 231 p38. During his time as an editor, he published many of these works within the periodicals for which he was responsible. * Das Buch der Liebe (1876, educational work) * Geographische Predigten (1876, educational work) * Der beiden Quitzows letzte Fahrten (1877, unfinished) * Auf hoher See gefangen (Auf der See gefangen, parts later revised for Old Surehand II) (1878) * Scepter und Hammer (1880) * Im fernen Westen (reworked in Old Firehand (1875) and later in Winnetou II)(1879) * Der Waldl√§ufer (reworked in \\"Le Coureur de Bois\\", a novel by Gabriel Ferry) * Die Juweleninsel (1882) The shorter stories of the early work can be grouped as follows, although in some works genres overlap. Some of the shorter stories were later published in anthologies, for example, Der Karawanenw√ºrger und andere Erz√§hlungen (1894), Humoresken und Erz√§hlungen (1902) and Erzgebirgische Dorfgeschichten (1903). * Adventure fiction and early travel stories (for example, Inn-nu-woh, der Indianerh√§uptling, 1875) * Crime fiction (for example, Wanda, 1875) * Historical fiction (for example, Robert Surcouf, 1882) * Humorous stories (for example, Die Fastnachtsnarren, 1875) * Series about \\"the Old Dessauer\\", Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (for example, Pandur und Grenadier, 1883) * Stories of villages in the Ore Mountains (for example, Die Rose von Ernstthal, 1874 or 1875) * Natural history works (for example, Sch√§tze und Schatzgr√§ber, 1875) * Letters and poems (for example, Meine einstige Grabinschrift, 1872). = Colportage novels = Cover for Waldr√∂schen May wrote five large (many thousands of pages) colportage novels, which he published either anonymously or under pseudonyms between 1882 and 1888. * Das Waldr√∂schen (1882‚Äì84, a part was later revised for Old Surehand II) * Die Liebe des Ulanen (1883‚Äì85) * Der verlorne Sohn oder Der F√ºrst des Elends (1884‚Äì86) * Deutsche Herzen (Deutsche Helden) (1885‚Äì88) * Der Weg zum Gl√ºck (1886‚Äì88) From 1900 to 1906, M√ºnchmeyer's successor Adalbert Fischer published the first book editions. These were revised by third hand and published under May's real name instead of pseudonyms. This edition was not authorized by May and he tried to stop its publication. = Travel stories = Cover of Orangen und Datteln by Fritz Bergen (1893) Thirty-three volumes of Carl May's Gesammelte Reiseromane, (Karl May's Gesammelte Reiseerz√§hlungen) were published from 1892 to 1910 by Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld. Most had been previously published in Deutscher Hausschatz, but some were new. The best known titles are the Orient Cycle (volumes 1 - 6) and the Winnetou-Trilogy (volumes 7 - 9). Beyond these shorter cycles, the works are troubled by chronological inconsistencies arising when original articles were revised for book editions. # Durch W√ºste und Harem (1892, since 1895 titled Durch die W√ºste) # Durchs wilde Kurdistan (1892) # Von Bagdad nach Stambul (1892) # In den Schluchten des Balkan (1892) # Durch das Land der Skipetaren (1892) # Der Schut (1892) # Winnetou I (1893, also titled Winnetou der Rote Gentleman I) # Winnetou II (1893, also titled Winnetou der Rote Gentleman II) # Winnetou III (1893, also titled Winnetou der Rote Gentleman III) * Orangen und Datteln (1893, an anthology) * Am Stillen Ocean (1894, an anthology) * Am Rio de la Plata (1894) * In den Cordilleren (1894) * Old Surehand I (1894) * Old Surehand II (1895) * Im Lande des Mahdi I (1896) * Im Lande des Mahdi II (1896) * Im Lande des Mahdi III (1896) * Old Surehand III (1897) * Satan und Ischariot I (1896) * Satan und Ischariot II (1897) * Satan und Ischariot III (1897) * Auf fremden Pfaden (1897, an anthology) * Weihnacht! (1897) * Im Reiche des silbernen L√∂wen I (1898) * Im Reiche des silbernen L√∂wen II (1898) * Am Jenseits (1899) May's oeuvre includes some shorter travel stories that were not published within this series (for example, Eine Befreiung in Die Rose von Ka√Ørwan, 1894). After the founding of the Karl May Press in 1913, works in Gesammelte Werke were revised (sometimes extensively) and many received new titles. Texts (other than those from Fehsenfeld Press) were also added to the new series. = Stories for young readers = Cover of Der blaurote Methusalem by Oskar Herrfurth These stories were written from 1887 to 1897 for the magazine Der Gute Kamerad. Most of the stories are set in the Wild West, but Old Shatterhand is just a figure and not the first-person narrator as he is in the travel stories. The best-known volume is Der Schatz im Silbersee. In the broadest sense, the early works Im fernen Westen and Der Waldl√§ufer belong in this category. * Der Sohn des B√§renj√§gers (1887, since 1890 within Die Helden des Westens) * Der Geist des Llano estakata (1888, since 1890 correctly titled as Der Geist des Llano estakado within Die Helden des Westens) * Kong-Kheou, das Ehrenwort (1888/89, since 1892 titled Der blaurote Methusalem) * Die Sklavenkarawane (1890) * Der Schatz im Silbersee (1891) * Das Verm√§chtnis des Inka (1892) * Der Oelprinz (1894, since 1905 titled as Der √ñlprinz) * Der schwarze Mustang (1897) * Replies to letters from readers in Der Gute Kamerad. = Mature work = Ardistan und Dschinnistan, 1909, cover by Sascha Schneider showing Marah Durimeh May's mature work dates to 1900, after his travels to the East.Schmid E. A. Gestalt und Idee. p. 367-420 in Karl May. ICH 39th Edition Verlag, Bamberg, 1995 Many of them were published by Fehsenfeld. * Himmelsgedanken (1900, poem collection) * Im Reiche des silbernen L√∂wen III (1902) * Erzgebirgische Dorfgeschichten (1903, anthology) * Im Reiche des silbernen L√∂wen IV (1903) * Und Friede auf Erden! (1904) * Babel und Bibel (1906, drama) * Ardistan und Dschinnistan I (1909) * Ardistan und Dschinnistan II (1909) * Winnetou IV (1910) * Mein Leben und Streben (1910, autobiography) * Schamah (1907) and other short stories. * Briefe √ºber Kunst (1907) and other articles. * \\"Karl May als Erzieher\\" und \\"Die Wahrheit √ºber Karl May\\" oder Die Gegner Karl Mays in ihrem eigenen Lichte (1902) and other legal proceedings. = Other works = May was a member of the \\"Lyra\\" choir in about 1864 and composed musical works, including a version of Ave Maria and Vergiss mich nicht within Ernste Kl√§nge, 1899.K√ºhne H. and Lorenz C. F. Karl May und die Musik. Verlag, Bamberg and Radebeul, 1999. During his last years, May lectured on his philosophical ideas. * Drei Menschheitsfragen: Wer sind wir? Woher kommen wir? Wohin gehen wir? (Lawrence, 1908) * Sitara, das Land der Menschheitsseele (Augsburg, 1909) * Empor ins Reich der Edelmenschen (Vienna, 1912) Furthermore, there are posthumous publications of fragments of stories and dramas, lyrics, musical compositions, letters and the library catalog.  Reception = Number of copies and translations = It is stated that Karl May is the \\"most read writer of the German tongue\\". The total number of copies published is about 200 million, half in German.Petzel M. and Wehnert J. Das neue Lexikon rund um Karl May. Lexikon Imprint Verlag, Berlin 2002. It was considered that May's first translated work was the first half of the Orient Cycle into a French daily in 1881.von Th√ºna U. √úbersetzungen in Ueding G.Karl- May-Handbuch K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, 2001 p519‚Äì522. , 9783826018138. Recently, it was discovered, and confirmed by Hans Dieter Steinmet (Karl May Museum) that Croatian writer Nikola Tordinac published translation of May's novel Tree carde monte in the magazine Sriemski Hrvat in 1880. Glas Slavonije otkrio je prvi, Tordinƒçev prijevod Karla Maya u svijetu! Glas Slavonije, 20 December 2016. Acces date 8 June 2020. Tordinac's translation became in 2017 a part of permanent exhibition of the Karl May Museum. Since that time, May's work has been translated into more than 30 languages, including Latin, Bulgarian and Esperanto. In the 1960s, UNESCO said that May was the most translated German writer. His most popular translations are Bulgarian, Czech, Hungarian and Dutch. Seabury Press, New York, began publishing English translations by Michael Shaw in 1977. In 2001, Nemsi Books Publishing Company, Pierpont, South Dakota, was one of the first English publishing houses to produce the unabridged translations of May's oeuvre. = Influence = May had a substantial influence on a number of well-known German-speaking people and on the German population itself.\\"Ich bin ein Cowboy\\" The Economist, 24 May 2001. The popularity of his writing, and indeed his (generally German) protagonists, are seen as having filled a lack in the German psyche which had few popular heroes until the 19th century. His readers longed to escape from an industrialised, capitalist society, an escape which May offered.Camurat D. The American Indian in the Great War, Real and Imagined May \\"helped shape the collective German dream of feats far beyond middle-class bounds.\\"Tales Of The Grand Teutons: Karl May Among The Indians. The New York Times, 4 January 1987 and contributed to the popular image of Native Americans in German-speaking countries. The name Winnetou has an entry in the German dictionary, Duden. The wider influence on the populace also surprised US occupation troops after World War II, who realised that thanks to May, \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" were familiar concepts to local children (though fantastic and removed from reality). Many well-known German-speaking people used May's heroes as models in their childhood.M√ºller E. Aufgespie√üt in KMG-Nachrichten Albert Einstein enjoyed May's books and said, \\"My whole adolescence stood under his sign. Indeed, even today, he has been dear to me in many a desperate hour...\\"  May as an influence on the Nazis  Adolf Hitler was an admirer, who noted in Mein Kampf that the novels \\"overwhelmed\\" him as a boy, going as far as to ensure \\"a noticeable decline\\" in his school grades. According to an anonymous friend, Hitler attended the lecture given by May in Vienna in March 1912 and was enthusiastic about the event.Anonymous Mein Freund Hitler in Moravsky ilustrovany zpravodaj. 1935, No. 40 p10. Ironically, the lecture was an appeal for peace, also heard by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Bertha von Suttner. Claus Roxin doubts the anonymous description, because Hitler had said much about May, but not that he had seen him.Roxin C. Letter dated 24 February 2004. Cited in Wohlgschaft Karl May - Leben und Werk, p. 2000. Hitler defended May against critics in the men's hostel where he lived in Vienna, as the evidence of May's earlier time in jail had come to light; although it was true, Hitler confessed that May had never visited the sites of his American adventure stories. This made him a greater writer in Hitler's view since it showed the author's powers of imagination. May died suddenly only ten days after the lecture, leaving the young Hitler deeply upset.Hamman B. Hitler's Vienna: A Dictator's Apprenticeship Oxford University Press, New York 1999 p382 - 385 . Hitler later recommended the books to his generals and had special editions distributed to soldiers at the front, praising Winnetou as an example of \\"tactical finesse and circumspection\\", though some note that the latter claims of using the books as military guidance are not substantiated. However, as told by Albert Speer, \\"when faced by seemingly hopeless situations, he [Hitler] would still reach for these stories,\\" because \\"they gave him courage like works of philosophy for others or the Bible for elderly people.\\"Grafton A. Mein Buch The New Republic, December 2008. Hitler's admiration for May led the German writer Klaus Mann to accuse May of having been a form of \\"mentor\\" for Hitler. In his admiration, Hitler ignored May's Christian and humanitarian approach and views completely, not mentioning his relatively sympathetic description of Jews and other persons of non-Northern European ancestry. The fate of Native Americans in the United States was used during the world wars for anti-American propaganda. The National Socialists in particular tried to use May's popularity and his work for their purposes.  Indianert√ºmelei  The popularity of May's books sparked a fascination in German popular culture with the Indians of North America that continues to this day. In 1985, the German scholar Hartmut Lutz invented the term Deutsche Indianert√ºmelei (\\"German Indian Enthusiasm\\") for the phenomenon.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.12 The phrase Indianert√ºmelei is a reference to the German term Deutscht√ºmelei (\\"German Enthusiasm\\") which mockingly describes the phenomenon of celebrating in an excessively nationalistic and romanticized manner Deutschtum (\\"Germanness\\").Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.12 In the English-speaking world, the phenomenon of the German obsession with the First Nations of North America is known as \\"Indianthusiasm\\".Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.12 In a 1999 speech delivered in the United States in English, Lutz declared: As part of the phenomenon of Indianert√ºmelei a number of Western and Indian theme parks operate in Germany, the most popular of which are the Pullman City theme park outside of Munich and El Dorado theme park outside of Berlin.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.16 May's books also inspired hobbyist clubs, where Germans pretend to be cowboys or Indians, the first of which was the Cowboy Club founded in Munich in 1913.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.16 In 2019, it was estimated that between 40,000-100,000 Germans are involved in Indianer hobbyist clubs at any given moment.Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.16 Interviewed in 2007, one member of an Indianer club stated: \\"Our camp is always in summer, in July for two weeks. During this time, we live in tipis, we wear only Indian clothes. We don't use technology and we try to follow Indian traditions. We have those [pretending to be] Lakota, Oglala, Blackfeet, Blood, Siksika, Pawneee...and we go on the warpath against each other day and night, anytime at all. In two weeks, every tribe can fight each other. We don't know when somebody will attack or when they will come to steal our horses. And the battles are always exciting, too. I really enjoy them\\".Watchman, Renne, Lutz, Hartmut & Strzelczyk, Florence Indianthusiasm, Waterloo: Wilfred Laurier Press, 2020 p.16-17  Influence on other authors  The German writer Carl Zuckmayer was intrigued by May's Apache chief and named his daughter Maria Winnetou. Max von der Gr√ºn said he read May as a young boy. When asked whether reading May's books had given him anything, he answered, \\"No. It took something away from me. The fear of bulky books, that is.\\"Thor Heyerdahl Gymnasium, Anecdotes in German. Heinz Werner H√∂ber, the twofold Glauser prize winner, was a follower of May. He said, \\"When I was about 12 years old I wrote my first novel on Native Americans which was, of course, from the beginning to the end completely stolen from Karl May.\\" He had pleaded with friends to get him to Radebeul \\"because Radebeul meant Karl May\\". There, he was deeply impressed by the museum and said, \\"My great fellow countryman from Hohenstein-Ernstthal and his immortal heroes have never left me ever since.\\"Eik J. Der Mann, der Jerry Cotton war. Erinnerungen des Bestsellerautors Heinz Werner H√∂ber. Das Neue Berlin, Berlin, 1996. = Adaptations = May's poem Ave Maria (1896) was set to music in at least 19 versions. Other poems, especially from the collection Himmelsgedanken were also set to music. Carl Ball wrote Harp Clangs for the drama Babel und Bibel for May. The Swiss composer Othmar Schoeck adapted Der Schatz im Silbersee for opera. May's concepts, such as Winnetou's death, inspired musical works.K√ºhne H. Vertonungen in Ueding's Karl-May-Handbuch p532 - 535. The first stage adaptation of May's work was Winnetou (1919) by Hermann Dimmler. Dimmler and Ludwig K√∂rner made revised editions of the play. Different novel revisions have been played on outdoor stages since the 1940s. The Karl May Festival in Bad Segeberg has been held every summer since 1952 and in Lennestadt-Elspe since 1958. At some of these festivals, Pierre Brice has played Winnetou. Another festival has been conducted on a rock stage in Rathen, in Saxon Switzerland near Radebeul in 1940 and then since 1984.Hatzig H. Dramatisierungen in Ueding's Karl-May-Handbuch, p523 - 526. In 1920, May's friend Marie Luise Droop, her husband Adolf Droop and the Karl May Press founded Ustad-Film, a production company. Ustad-Film made three silent movies (Auf den Tr√ºmmern des Paradieses, Die Todeskarawane and Die Teufelsanbeter) after the Orientcycle. The company became bankrupt in 1921 and the films are lost. In 1936 a first sound movie Durch die W√ºste was shown. ' (1958) and its sequel ' (1959) were the first colour movies. From 1962 to 1968, a series of May movies were made.Hatzig H. Verfilmungen in Ueding's Karl-May-Handbuch p. 527 - 531. While most of the seventeen movies of this series were Wild West movies (beginning with Der Schatz im Silbersee), three were based on the Orientcycle and two on Das Waldr√∂schen. Most of these movies were made separately by the two competitors Horst Wendlandt and Artur Brauner. Several actors were employed, including Lex Barker (Old Shatterhand, Kara Ben Nemsi, Karl Sternau), Pierre Brice (Winnetou), Gojko Mitiƒá (Winnetou), Stewart Granger (Old Surehand), Milan Srdoƒç (Old Wabble) and Ralf Wolter (Sam Hawkens, Hadschi Halef Omar, Andr√© Hasenpfeffer). The film score by Martin B√∂ttcher and the landscape of Yugoslavia are associated with the movies. Other movies such as Die Spur f√ºhrt zum Silbersee (1990) and TV productions such as Das Buschgespenst (1986) and the television series Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi (1973) were produced. The productions vary from the original written works. In 2016, German RTL Television premiered three-part television movies based on Winnetou, directed by Philipp St√∂lzl.Winnetou (2016 film) In the part \\"Winnetou and Old Shatterhand\\", Gojko Mitiƒá, one of the actors who played Winnetou in the '60s movies, portrayed a character named Intschu Tschuna. May's works (about 300) have been adapted for audio dramas, particularly in the 1960s.Karl May audio drama database The first, Der Schatz im Silbersee, was written by G√ºnther Bibo in 1929. There are also Czech and Danish versions of the audio dramas. In 1988, Der Schatz im Silbersee was read by Gert Westphal and published as an audiobook. Wann sehe ich dich wieder, du lieber, lieber Winnetou? (1995) is a compendium of Karl May texts read by Hermann Wiedenroth. In the 1950s Croatian comic book artist Walter Neugebauer finished his 1930s comic book adaptation of Karl May's stories. Serbian artist Aleksandar Hecl also drew one.In the 1960s and 1970s, May's works were adapted for German comics including an eight-issue series based on Winnetou and a further nine-issue series titled Karl May (1963‚Äì1965). The series was drawn by Helmut Nickel and Harry Ehrt and published by Walter Lehning Verlag. Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen created a whole series of comics based on May's stories, simply titled Karl May (1962-1977). Eighty-seven issues of Karl May were published by Standaard Uitgeverij from 1962 to 1987. Comics based on May's novels were also produced in Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Mexico, Spain and Sweden.Petzel M. Comics und Bildergeschichten in Ueding: Karl-May-Handbuch p539 - 545. May's life has been the subject of screen works, novels and a stage play, including * Freispruch f√ºr Old Shatterhand (1965, directed by Hans Heinrich) * Karl May (1974, directed by Hans-J√ºrgen Syberberg) * Karl May (1992, directed by. Klaus √úberall, a television series in 8 episodes) * Swallow, mein wackerer Mustang (1980) by Erich Loest * Vom Wunsch, Indianer zu werden. Wie Franz Kafka Karl May traf und trotzdem nicht in Amerika landete (1994) by Peter Henisch * Old Shatterhand in Moabit (1994) by Walter P√ºschel * Karl May und der Wettermacher (2001) by J√ºrgen Heinzerling * Die Taschenuhr des Anderen by Willi Olbrich. = Copies, parodies, and sequels = May was copied or parodied during his lifetime. Some wrote similar Wild West stories. Others, such as Franz Treller, published under May's name.Wehnert J. Fortsetzungen, Erg√§nzungen und Bearbeitungen. in Karl-May- Handbuch p509 - 511. Novelizations of May's characters include * Hadschi Halef Omar (2010) J√∂rg Kastner describes the first contact of the titular character with Kara Ben Nemsi. * In Mekka (1923) Franz Kandolf, a sequel to Am Jenseits (Karl May's Gesammelte Werke volume 50). * \\"Die Schatten des Schah-in-Schah\\" (2006) Heinz Grill, an alternative to Im Reiche des silbernen L√∂wen III/IV. * Winnetous Testament Jutta Laroche and Reinhard Marheinecke, a series of eight volumes as a sequel to Winnetou IV. * Der Schuh des Manitu (2001) Michael Herbig, a parody on the Karl May films of the 1960s. = Legacy = Asteroid 15728 Karlmay is named in May's honour.15728 Karlmay NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory ‚Äì Small-Body Database. Accessed 16 October 2012.  Karl May institutions = Karl May Foundation = In his will, May made his second wife, Klara, his sole heiress. He instructed that after her death all of his property and any future earnings from his work should go to a foundation. This foundation should support the education of the gifted poor including writers, journalists, and editors. One year after May's death, on 5 March 1913, Klara May established the \\"Karl May Foundation\\" (\\"Karl-May-Stiftung\\"). Contributions have been made since 1917. Klara and Karl May's estate went to the foundation. The foundation established the Karl May Museum to maintain the Villa Shatterhand, the estates, the collections and May's tomb.Schmid E. Karl Mays Tod und Nachla√ü. in Karl May ICH 39th edition. Karl-May-Verlag, Bamberg, 1995, pp. 327‚Äì365.Wagner R. Karl-May-Stiftung (Radebeul) in Ueding: Karl-May- Handbuch, pp. 549‚Äì551. In 1960, the Karl May Foundation received the Karl May Press. = Karl May Press = On 1 July 1913, Klara May, Friedrich Ernst Fehsenfeld (May's main publisher) and the jurist Euchar Albrecht Schmid established the \\"Foundation Press Fehsenfeld & Co.\\" (\\"Stiftungs-Verlag Fehsenfeld & Co.\\") in Radebeul. In 1915, the name changed to \\"Karl May Press\\" (\\"Karl-May-Verlag\\" (KMV)). The KMV consolidated the rights to May's works from internal discord and from other publishers.Wehnert, J√ºrgen. Der Karl-May- Verlag in Ueding: Karl-May-Handbuch p. 554 - 558. Third-hand revisions of these texts were added to the series Karl May‚Äôs Gesammelte Reiseerz√§hlungen, which was renamed to Karl May‚Äôs Gesammelte Werke (und Briefe). The existing 33 volumes of the original series were also revised, some extensively. By 1945 there were 65 volumes. The press is exclusive to May's work and subsidiary literature. Besides the Gesammelte Werke (the classical \\"green volumes\\"), which have 91 volumes today, the press has a huge reprint programme. The Karl May Press aims to rehabilitate May from literary criticism and to support the Karl May Foundation. In 1921, Fehsenfeld left and in 1960, the foundation fell to Klara May's estate, and thus the Press is owned by the Schmid family. In 1959, due to censorship in the Soviet occupation zone and East Germany, the Press moved to Bamberg (Germany). In 1963, when copyright ended, the Press began commercialising May's works. After German reunification, in 1996, the Press took a second office in Radebeul. The name \\"Karl May\\" is a registered trade mark of the \\"Karl May Verwaltungs- und Vertriebs-GmbH\\", which belongs to the Karl May Press. = Museums = Radebeul  Karl May's Villa Shatterhand Villa B√§renfett The Karl May Museum is in the Villa Shatterhand in Radebeul and contains artifacts from May's life as well as from life on the American frontier and Native American life of that era. It was founded in 1928 by May's widow and an eccentric Austrian named Ernst Tobis. When the Nazis took over Germany, they appropriated the museum and the image of May, and were especially focused on swastikas that appeared in some of the Native American artwork. Hitler Youth were encouraged to visit the museum and hear stories from Tobis. After World War II, the original museum was in East Germany and a replica was built in Bamberg in West Germany. From 1956 to 1984, the museum in Radebul was called the \\"Indianer Museum\\", because May's books were suppressed by the East German government; its original name was restored in 1986. Around 2010, controversy arose over scalps, some of them from Native Americans, that were in the museum's collection.  Hohenstein-Ernstthal  The \\"Karl May House\\" (\\"Karl-May-Haus\\") is the three-centuries-old weaver house where May was born. Since 12 March 1985, it has been a memorial and museum. It shows an original weaving room and non-German book editions. The garden has been arranged according to May's description in his memoirs. Opposite the house is the International Karl May Heritage Center (\\"Karl-May-Begegnungsst√§tte\\"), which is used for events and special exhibitions. In Hohenstein-Ernstthal, called \\"Karl May Home Town\\" since 1992, every May-related place has a commemorative plaque. These places are connected by a \\"Karl May Path\\" (\\"Karl- May-Wanderweg\\"). Outside the city lies the \\"Karl May Cave\\" (\\"Karl-May-H√∂hle\\"), where May found shelter during his criminal times.Neubert A. Karl-May-Haus (Hohenstein-Ernstthal) in Karl-May-Handbuch p. 546 - 547. = Societies = In the 1890s, there were Karl May clubs.Wohlgschaft: Karl May ‚Äì Leben und Werk. p. 1029 Today, various entities focus on research about the author.Heinemann E. Organe und Perspektiven der Karl-May-Forschung. In: Ueding: Karl-May- Handbuch, p559 - 564. These organisations exist in German-speaking regions, the Netherlands, Australia and Indonesia. While such societies are responsible for the release of most May-related periodicals, for example, Der Beobachter an der Elbe, Karl-May-Haus Information, Wiener Karl-May-Brief, and Karl May in Leipzig, the magazine Karl May & Co. is published independently. The \\"Karl May Society\\" (KMG), founded on 22 March 1969, is the largest organisation, with approximately 1800 members.Satzung der Karl-May-Gesellschaft e.V. 2 March 2010. The KMG publishes Jahrbuch, Mitteilungen, Sonderhefte der Karl-May- Gesellschaft, and KMG-Nachrichten and reprints.

Based in New York City and formed in the 1990s, Nada Surf continues to tour. Their ninth album, Never Not Together, was released on 7 February 2020. History=1990s= Nada Surf was formed in 1992 by Matthew Caws and Daniel Lorca. They originally went by the name Helicopter but later changed it to Nada Surf, which Caws said is \\"actually referring to something much more existential, it's just surfing on nothing. Being lost in your head or in your imagination but you know, whenever I listen to music I always find myself off somewhere. Somewhere in space. You know, in mental space and it's a reference to that.\\" The members met in the Lyc√©e Fran√ßais de New York; both spent some of their childhood in France and Belgium, and played in many bands, including The Cost of Living and Because Because Because. Their first drummer, Dan (later alluded to in the song \\"The Plan\\" from the album High/Low), was replaced by Aaron Conte, with whom the band recorded their first 7\\", The Plan/Telescope (1994), as well as the demo tape Tafkans, the raw version of High/Low. Those raw versions were later released on their second 7\\", Deeper Well/Pressure Free (1995), on the Karmic, and on North 6th Street. In 1995, Conte left the band and was replaced by Ira Elliot, former drummer of the Fuzztones, a band from the 1980s New York scene, and of whom both Caws and Lorca were fans. After a Blonde Redhead show at the Knitting Factory, Nada Surf met former Cars frontman and Weezer producer Ric Ocasek. With little hope, they presented him with a copy of Tafkans. Three weeks later, Ocasek called back with news of his intention to produce the album. Soon after, the band was finalizing a contract with Elektra Records through an executive, Josh Deutsch. In early 1996, they released High/Low, their debut album, which was recorded and mastered within a 19-day period. Prior to this, the band released the EP Karmic on No. 6 Records, a label run by Elektra A&R; head Terry Tolkin. That summer, as Nada Surf toured the United States with Superdrag, their song \\"Popular\\" became a summer anthem, and the band toured overseas. In 1998, they released The Proximity Effect, their follow-up album, in Europe. Produced by Fred Maher, the album gained little commercial success in the US. Their record label, thinking the album lacked a hit like \\"Popular\\", had the band record several covers, including \\"Black & White\\" (The dBs) and \\"Why Are You So Mean to Me?\\" (Vitreous Humor), to use as singles. Tired of the requirements of the A&R; director, the band judged the album was perfect as-is (even though Elektra suggested the inclusion of an acoustic version of \\"Popular\\"), and broke their contract. As a consequence, Elektra did not release the album in the US and dropped the band while they were on a promotional tour in Europe. Despite these events, this album was critically acclaimed in France, where the band did a 30-show tour the following year. =2000s= In 2000, Nada Surf released The Proximity Effect in the United States on their own label, MarDev (named after Caws' maternal grandmother, Margaret Devereux Lippitt, daughter of the painter Margaret Walthour Lippitt), after being dropped by Elektra. Subsequently, the band performed at their record release party at Luna Lounge in New York City and toured extensively for several months to rebuild their North-American fan base. From 1999 to 2002, the band members took regular day jobs: Caws worked at a Brooklyn record store called Earwax, Lorca worked on some computer projects, and Elliot did drum and guitar session work for other artists. Caws later referred to these times as a period of luxury, and the record store job as his \\"favorite job ever.\\" In 2002, they released Let Go, a critically acclaimed album which included the successful single \\"Inside of Love\\". They went on tour for several months, including many European festivals, in the summer of 2003. Mostly recorded the year before, the album was produced by their friends Louie Lino and Chris Fudurich, who had engineered The Proximity Effect; the band paid them with $1 and $5 bills, the money earned from tour merchandise sales. In 2005, Nada Surf released The Weight Is a Gift on Barsuk Records, an album produced by Chris Walla (among others), and finished touring for this album in October of the following year. The record was made during a month spent at John Vanderslice's Tiny Telephone studio in San Francisco. In 2008, the band released Lucky, an album made with producer John Goodmanson at the Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, from material recorded the year before. That same year, their song \\"No Quick Fix\\" was featured as the Spinner MP3 of the Day, and they were featured on the cover of Beyond Race Magazine for the publication's winter issue. =2010s= Nada Surf performing in 2012 In 2010, the band released If I Had a Hi-Fi, an album of covers including songs by the likes of Depeche Mode, Kate Bush, Spoon, and The Go-Betweens. Milwaukee noise rock band IfIHadAHiFi reciprocally titled their next album Nada Surf EP+3. In 2012, Nada Surf released The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy, an album which included the single \\"Waiting for Something\\" and introduced former Guided by Voices guitarist Doug Gillard as a fourth band member. In 2012, Caws, who had moved to England, recorded acoustic versions of five of the songs from The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy as b-sides, in collaboration with record producer Lee Russell. The material was released as The Dulcitone Files EP. The group released a compilation of rarities called B-Sides in 2014. Nada Surf's eighth studio album, You Know Who You Are, with an official release date of 4 March 2016, was released for streaming in late February 2016. In 2018, for the 15th anniversary of Let Go, the charity cover album Standing at the Gates: The Songs of Nada Surf‚Äôs Let Go was released, benefiting ACLU and The Pablove Foundation. The album featured artists such as The Long Winters, Ed Harcourt, and Aimee Mann. =2020s= In November 2019, Nada Surf announced that their ninth studio album, Never Not Together, would be released via Barsuk Records (USA) and City Slang (UK) on 7 February 2020. At the time of the announcement, they released a new single and lyric video, \\"Something I Should Do\\". According to the band, their experience while celebrating the 15th anniversary of Let Go in 2017 pushed them into a different creative mindset. They recorded many demos before thinning down the selection in an effort to find focus. The band also announced a major world tour to celebrate the album's release, starting on 14 January in Seattle, before moving through the US and also encompassing dates in the UK, Germany, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Another single followed in December, entitled \\"Looking for You\\", accompanied by a music video directed by the band themselves. Nada Surf opened the new decade with a single release - \\"So Much Love\\" - on 8 January, the third from Never Not Together. It garnered Rolling Stone's attention, who reviewed the single favorably. Double J in Australia added it and the previous single \\"Something I Should Do\\" to their playlist. On 15 January, Nada Surf began their Never Not Together world tour at Neptune Theatre in Seattle.

The band currently consists of Jordan Pundik (lead vocals), Ian Grushka (bass guitar), Chad Gilbert (lead guitar, backing vocals), and Cyrus Bolooki (drums). Longtime rhythm guitarist and lyricist Steve Klein departed from the band in late 2013. During their lengthy recording career, the band have released ten studio albums, one live album, two EPs, and four cover albums. After forming in 1997, New Found Glory released their debut studio album Nothing Gold Can Stay in 1999. The band then released their self-titled major label debut in 2000, with the album's song \\"Hit or Miss\\" peaking at number 15 the Alternative Songs chart. In 2002, the band became mainstream with their album Sticks and Stones and the album's hit \\"My Friends Over You\\". The groups popularity continued with their 2004 album Catalyst, of which the video for \\"All Downhill From Here\\" was nominated for a VMA for Breakthrough Video of the Year. Lead by single \\"It's Not Your Fault\\", the mid-tempo and critically acclaimed Coming Home followed in 2006. The release showcased a temporarily move to an alternative rock style instead of their usual pop punk sound. The quintet returned to their energetic roots with the release of Not Without a Fight in 2009. They have since released four more albums; Radiosurgery in 2011, Resurrection in 2014, Makes Me Sick in 2017, and their tenth studio album Forever + Ever x Infinity in 2020. Emerging as part of the second wave of pop punk in the late 1990s, music critics consider them a key pioneer of the genre. Often labelled the \\"godfathers of pop punk\\", AllMusic credits them for \\"practically serving alongside the work of Blink-182 as the blueprint to the entire genre for the early 2000s.\\" Alternative Press have praised the group for their \\"innovative and entirely irresistible fusion of punk melodies and hardcore breakdowns.\\" As such, New Found Glory are considered highly influential in the development of the sub genre easycore. History=Formation and debut releases (1997‚Äì1999)= The origins of New Found Glory date back to 1997 when Jordan Pundik (vocals) and Ian Grushka (bass) played together in the band \\"Inner City Kids\\" and later \\"Flip 60\\". After disbanding \\"Flip 60\\", they recruited Stephen Klein (guitar), who Pundik met at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and had previously played with him in the band \\"Fallview\\". The three began to jam together. Practicing in Grushka's garage, they later invited Joe \\"Taco Joe\\" Marino to play drums. Shortly thereafter, Chad Gilbert (lead guitar), former vocalist of Shai Hulud, joined to complete the quintet. Pundik later stated the band name was created while he and Klein were working at Red Lobster together; \\"We came up with A New Found Glory, we wrote it on a napkin. I think we pulled some of it from \\"A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts\\" by the Get Up Kids\\". The band recorded their debut EP, It's All About the Girls (1997) in a friend's apartment, and the EP was distributed by local independent label Fiddler Records. Soon after, Marino was replaced by current drummer Cyrus Bolooki after two rehearsal sessions. The band went on to tour up and down the East Coast and quickly sold out the entire pressing of the EP. The band's underground success soon caught the attention of Eulogy Recordings and the quintet subsequently signed shortly afterwards in order to increase distribution of their music. Following the success of their EP, the band recorded their debut full-length album, Nothing Gold Can Stay (1999), initially selling one-page insert copies at their shows supporting MxPx. Richard Reines, co-founder of Drive-Thru Records had also noted their devout following and held talks with the band. Drive-Thru subsequently signed the five-piece and paid Eulogy $5,000 to license Nothing Gold Can Stay, which went on to sell more than 300,000 copies. =Rise in popularity and stardom (2000‚Äì2005)= The five-piece signed their first proper record deal with Drive-Thru Records, and released an EP of cover songs from film soundtracks entitled From the Screen to Your Stereo in 2000. Drive-Thru's relationship with MCA Records ensured that the smaller label's more popular bands would be picked up by the major. Later that year, debut single \\"Hit or Miss\\" peaked at No. 15 on the US Modern Rock Chart, which helped propel the band to a mainstream audience. Subsequently, their self-titled second album and major label debut New Found Glory (2000) reached number one on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, and spent 21 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart. In a Kerrang! magazine article years later, they referred to the album as the band's Essential Purchase. They wrote, \\"marking one of the biggest and quickest improvements in alternative music, the major label debut hurled them to the forefront of the punk scene barely 12 months after its predecessor. Packed with infectious melodies and sing-along anthems, it would see them jostling with the likes of Blink-182 for the genre's crown.\\" The album also marked the official debut of the band's new moniker, which dropped the indefinite article \\"A\\" from their original name due to some fans struggling to find the band's records in stores. The album was certified gold by the RIAA. In 2001 the band performed at EdgeFest Calgary. Between 2002 and 2004, the band experienced the height of their popularity with headline slots on the Warped Tour with Blink-182 and a supporting tour with Green Day. Third album Sticks and Stones was released on June 11, 2002 and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. The record spawned two popular singles; \\"My Friends Over You\\" and \\"Head on Collision\\". Following the success of the album, the band headlined the 2002 Warped Tour and later saw the album certified gold by the RIAA. The lead single for their fourth album, \\"All Downhill from Here\\" reached number eleven in the Rock Chart before Catalyst (2004) was released. The album peaked at a career-high number three on the Billboard 200, selling 146,000 copies in its first week. The heavier style of the record, which included some metal and new wave influences, was due to the comparisons that magazines and other media outlets would make between New Found Glory and other popular bands. Chad Gilbert stated: \\"Well, when Sticks and Stones came out and we were doing that Honda Civic Tour, we were getting compared to bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan we were angry with that. At that point, we were getting compared to more pop bands and we aren't a pop band.\\" The band promoted the album with a supporting tour with Green Day during the fall of 2004 on the American Idiot Tour. The song, \\"This Disaster\\", was featured in EA Sports' Madden NFL 2005, and \\"At Least I'm Known for Something\\" was featured in EA's Burnout 3: Takedown. This became the band's third record to be certified gold by the RIAA. =Maturity into later albums (2006‚Äì2009)= Demos for the next album were tracked with long-term friend and studio engineer Paul Miner, before the band worked with Thom Panunzio (Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, Ozzy Osbourne) having moved into a house together in Malibu, California called the Morning View Mansion to write and record. Gilbert took into the studio a book containing over 40 riff ideas that were written during the previous tour. Unlike their previous releases, Gilbert and Pundik also worked on lyrics alongside primary lyricist Steve Klein for the first time. The band had decided against working with Neal Avron, who had produced the band's three previous albums, as they wanted to try something different. Their fifth album titled Coming Home was released on September 19, 2006 with first single, \\"It's Not Your Fault\\" in July 2006. The release proved popular with many critics giving the album positive reviews. It was acclaimed for its \\"matured and nuanced songwriting\\", and was generally recognised as being the band's most mature work. From the Screen to Your Stereo Part II, the band's follow-up to From the Screen to Your Stereo - a full-length album, containing 11 songs plus one bonus track for the Japanese edition and iTunes - was released on September 18, 2007 via Drive-Thru Records. The first and only single from the album was \\"Kiss Me\\", which would become the band's last charting single. The music video can be viewed on MySpace. In March 2008, a compilation named Hits was released. Two previously unreleased songs, \\"Situations\\" and \\"Constant Static,\\" are also featured on the album. This was their last release on Drive-Thru/Geffen before signing with independent labels, Bridge Nine Records and Epitaph Records. In April 2008, the band released a new EP Tip of the Iceberg on CD, 7\\" and through digital music outlets on Bridge 9 Records containing both new material that paid homage to their melodic hardcore influences. The CD also included an extra disc from The International Superheroes of Hardcore, named Takin' It Ova!. Their sixth studio album, Not Without a Fight, was released on March 10, 2009, and was produced by Mark Hoppus. It was released through the band's new label, Epitaph Records. Hoppus has said that during recording, they had felt like a different band altogether. The lead single from the album was called \\"Listen to Your Friends\\". The music video for the song was filmed in Los Angeles. The single was released December 23, 2008 in the US & a day earlier in the UK, both via iTunes & AmazonMP3. Following the album's release, the quintet set out on the \\"Not Without a Fight Tour\\" with support from Set Your Goals, Bayside and Shai Hulud. The video for second single \\"Don't Let Her Pull You Down\\" premiered on October 15, and was released on October 20 via limited orange and sky blue vinyl prints. On October 17 the band played a free show for around 120 fans packed into the studio where the band played a setlist made up of fan requests. Chad Gilbert performs in Oklahoma City on September 11, 2010 =Return to pop punk sound and line-up change (2010‚Äì2013)= A special edition re-release to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their self-titled album was released on January 26, 2010 through Geffen Records. The additional material included new liner notes, demos, b-sides, The Story So Far DVD and a remix of debut single \\"Hit or Miss\\" by the late Jerry Finn. A full tour was also confirmed where the band would play the record in its entirety, with support from Saves the Day, Hellogoodbye and Fireworks. On the 29th and 30 May, the band headlined the Pop-Punk festival SlamDunk Festival held in Hatfield and Leeds. Shortly before the start of the band's commemorative tour, Gilbert visited his doctor for pneumonia. After suspicious cells were discovered in his thyroid, he underwent surgery which caused him to miss the first three dates of the new tour. Anthony Raneri of Bayside replaced him for this period. The surgery was a success. Later that year, the band headlined the Slam Dunk Festival along with Alkaline Trio and Capdown. New Found Glory began the new year by participating in the 2011 Soundwave Festival, and were later confirmed for the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August. The band also played a full tribute set to The Ramones with Marky Ramone on drums at The Bamboozle 2011 Festival. They returned to the studio in April to record their seventh album, titled Radiosurgery with Neal Avron the producer having also produced their second, third and fourth albums. Chad Gilbert has said that Radiosurgery \\"is the most upbeat, fun record we've ever recorded. Catchy but not in a fake pop sounding way. I wanted to go back to more of the roots of punk rock and pop punk and put a whole new NFG spin on it. The record goes from song to song never letting up the energy.\\" The lead single and title track, \\"Radiosurgery\\" was released on August 2. In March 2012, New Found Glory had announced via their website that they would be a part of the Vans Warped Tour lineup. New Found Glory will celebrate the 10th anniversary of Sticks And Stones by going on a small club tour in the fall, all around the country. In November Pundik said that the band will take a break and won't release a new album until 2014. AbsolutePunk confirmed that the band would be releasing A Very New Found Glory Christmas via cassette tape on December 1, as well as a live album some time in 2013. The band recorded 3 new songs which are on their upcoming live album Kill It Live released on October 7. Also announced in this period was the departure of founding member and rhythm guitarist Steve Klein, due to him being charged with multiple counts of inappropriate contact with a minor. On their Facebook page the band noted that there had been some disparity in the intended direction progressing forward, and that Steve and the remaining members had experienced insurmountable differences \\"over the years.\\" =Post-Klein activities (2014‚Äìpresent)= On February 25, 2014, the band announced an 11 date UK tour with main support by The Story So Far, stopping in cities around the country including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Cardiff and Leeds. On May 18, the band announced on their Facebook page that they would release a new album in the fall of 2014. They also mentioned that it would be released by Hopeless Records. On May 27, the band announced that they had left Epitaph Records and would be signing to Hopeless Records, where their new album will be released in the fall of 2014. On August 5, they released a new single \\"Selfless\\" from the upcoming album Resurrection. The band also filmed a music video to release with the single. On September 9, they released a new single \\"Ready and Willing\\" from the upcoming album Resurrection. The band also filmed a music video to release with the single. On October 7, 2014, they released Resurrection. On July 22, 2015, the band announced they would reissue the album on October 8, retitled Resurrection: Ascension. It features two brand new studio tracks, two reworked songs and three acoustic tracks. On the day of announcement, they also rereleased \\"Vicious Love\\" featuring Hayley Williams on vocals. New Found Glory live at Strand Festival in 2015 On September 28, 2016, New Found Glory announced via Facebook that pre-production had officially began for a new album and have since been posting pictures showing the progress of the writing process. On January 25, 2017, the band's next album, Makes Me Sick was announced for release on April 28. The first single \\"Happy Being Miserable\\", along with its music video, was released on February 15, 2017. The influence for the music video came from the pie eating scene from the movie Stand By Me. In January 2019, New Found Glory announced the third instalment of their cover series, the From the Screen to Your Stereo 3 EP, for release in May. On February 20, 2019, the band released the first song/video off their new cover series EP From The Screen To Your Stereo 3. They covered \\"The Power Of Love\\" by Huey Lewis and the News, which comes from the Back To The Future movies. It was also revealed they'll be covering songs from Frozen, Rocky and Twilight on the new release. On February 10, 2020, the band announced their tenth studio album Forever + Ever x Infinity, slated for release for May 29, 2020. The album features 15 songs, as the band did not want to cut any of the recorded material for the album. The first single, called \\"Greatest of All Time\\" was made available for listen the same day. On April 16, 2020, the band confirmed that they had delayed the release of Forever + Ever x Infinity to June 19, 2020, because it would initially be sold exclusively at Target and the band didn't want fans to have to go to the store during the COVID-19 pandemic. Side projects and collaborations The International Superheroes of Hardcore is a side project of all members of the band and features Gilbert on vocals and Pundik on guitar, with the remaining members playing the same instruments they play in New Found Glory. All the members use pseudonyms for their \\"characters\\" in the band (e.g. Gilbert is known as \\"Captain Straightedge\\"). The band also recorded an internet-only music video for \\"Dig My Own Grave\\" with director Joseph Pattisall. In April 2008 a compilation from the Punk Goes... series, called Punk Goes Crunk, was released, and features New Found Glory covering \\"Tennessee\\", originally by Arrested Development. New Found Glory had previously released another cover song, \\"Heaven\\", on Punk Goes Metal. During \\"Not Without a Fight\\" tour, a split EP with Shai Hulud titled Not Without a Heart Once Nourished by Sticks and Stones Within Blood Ill- Tempered Misanthropy Pure Gold Can Stay was exclusively released. There were two colors limited to a total of only 500 copies and only for sale from either Shai Hulud or New Found Glory at these shows. Dashboard Confessional were to be main support for New Found Glory's headline American tour in 2010. However, shortly before the tour was due to commence, Dashboard withdrew due to personal reasons and the tour was subsequently cancelled. A split EP, titled Swiss Army Bro-Mance had initially been due for sale on the previously cancelled tour, but was later made available online on a limited pressing of 2,500 copies. The two bands played several acoustic dates in December 2010. On December 10, 2011, New Found Glory performed a live set for \\"Guitar Center Sessions\\" on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt. Style, influences and legacy New Found Glory are widely recognized for their fast and energetic pop punk music. The band temporarily moved to an alternative rock style with their album Coming Home in 2006, and is sometimes described as such in general. The aforementioned Coming Home was viewed as a change in direction for the band with its more layered and mid- tempo sound and has been described as a \\"somber, honest, polished and alternative record.\\" They have also been described as melodic hardcore. The band's traditional sound has been described as \\"chunky and melodic\\", with Rolling Stone noting their penchant for \\"catchy, riffy punk-rock.\\" Consequence of Sound writer Megan Ritt called the band \\"paragons\\" of the pop punk genre and noted how \\"the seasoned Floridian rockers are renowned for their heartfelt guitar anthems.\\" The band's music typically builds upon verse-chorus song structures, combining pop-influenced melodies with fast punk rock tempos, hardcore-tinged breakdowns, and often gang vocals. Their fusion of pop punk with hardcore breakdowns has been labeled as easycore, a genre they are considered to have helped pioneer and named with one of their tours. Critics have praised the band for their ability to write infectious hooks and the sincerity of their lyrics, often about growing up and relationships. Chad Gilbert has noted that, \\"if the delivery is honest and real, that's what keeps it from being the corniest thing you've ever heard before. New Found Glory is a band that people enjoy listening to not because we give off this harsh message. We write about who we are and what affects us in life and those are our relationships\\". Bassist Ian Grushka has stated that \\"all of the lyrics are based on real life experiences.

He also performs as a children's artist under the pseudonym Caspar Babypants. Biography Ballew grew up in Seattle and attended middle and high school at The Bush School, where he met Dave Dederer, with whom he would later form The Presidents of the United States of America. In the late 1980s and early 90s Ballew lived in Boston, where he performed as a street musician in a duo called Egg with Phil Franklin (later of Caroliner Rainbow and Sunburned Hand of the Man).Chris Ballew Bandography, accessed August 19, 2010. Many of Ballew's songs with Egg would become well-known Presidents songs, most notably ‚ÄúNaked and Famous‚Äù, which is performed by Egg as a bonus track on a 2005 reissue of the Presidents' eponymous debut album. The two members of Egg were also part of the experimental triple-bass guitar ensemble Balls, which released a 12\\" EP in 1991. While in Boston, Ballew also played briefly with Mary Lou Lord, and with Mark Sandman of Treat Her Right and Morphine in a duo called Supergroup, in which they developed the oddly stringed instruments that would become a staple of both the Presidents' and Morphine's sound. Ballew moved to Los Angeles in the early 90s where he shared an apartment with alternative artist Beck and played in his live band. Ballew told Seattle Weekly that playing with Beck \\"was the beginning of my professional career as a guy getting paid to make music.\\" He returned to his native Washington in 1993 and started the Presidents of the United States of America. The band released six studio albums before splitting up in 2016. In 1998, Ballew released a solo album credited to The Giraffes. The band has been performing live since 2000 with the help of Jason Staczek (organ, clarinet) and Mike Musburger (drums).http://pusabase.com/songography_giraffes.html In 2009, Ballew launched a project targeted toward toddlers called Caspar Babypants. Ballew uses a three-string acoustic guitar when performing Caspar Babypants songs. To date, Caspar Babypants has released seventeen full-length albums, all with exclamatory titles such as Here I Am!, More Please!, This Is Fun!, Sing Along!, Hot Dog!, I Found You!, Baby Beatles!, Rise And Shine!, Night Night!, Beatles Baby!, and Away We Go!. In 2015, 15 years after the last official release, Chris Ballew put together We Hear Music, a 33-track double album consisting of previously unreleased Giraffes material. The album was shared privately with a few fans through the internet, with a note allowing the recipients to redistribute the music freely.http://pusabase.com/wordpress/2015/05/05/torrent-alert-the-giraffes-we- hear-music-2cd/ Equipment Ballew is endorsed by Epiphone Guitars and Orange amplifiers, utilising an Epiphone SG-400 guitar (converted into a two- string \\"basitar\\") as well as an AD200B MK 3 200-Watt Bass Head from Orange. No distortion pedals are used live, just the natural distortion of the amp is heard. Regarding his two-string \\"basitar\\", Ballew admits: \\"I'm technically not really a bass player, although, I play as if I'm playing bass lines, a lot of times I strum like (on a) guitar and make chords.

It was published by Jonathan Cape on 5 April 1955 and featured a cover design conceived by Fleming. The plot is derived from a Fleming screenplay that was too short for a full novel so he added the passage of the bridge game between Bond and the industrialist Hugo Drax. In the latter half of the novel, Bond is seconded to Drax's staff as the businessman builds the Moonraker, a prototype missile designed to defend England. Unknown to Bond, Drax is German, an ex-Nazi now working for the Soviets; his plan is to build the rocket, arm it with a nuclear warhead, and fire it at London. Uniquely for a Bond novel, Moonraker is set entirely in Britain, which raised comments from some readers, complaining about the lack of exotic locations. Moonraker, like Fleming's previous novels, was well received by critics. Moonraker plays on a number of 1950s fears, including attack by rockets (following the V-2 strikes of the Second World War), nuclear annihilation, Soviet communism, the re-emergence of Nazism and the \\"threat from within\\" posed by both ideologies. Fleming examines Englishness, and the novel shows the virtues and strength of England. Adaptations include a broadcast on South African radio in 1956 starring Bob Holness and a 1958 Daily Express comic strip. The novel's name was used in 1979 for the eleventh official film in the Eon Productions Bond series and the fourth to star Roger Moore as Bond; the plot was significantly changed from the novel to include excursions into space. Plot The British Secret Service agent James Bond is asked by his superior, M, to join him at M's club, Blades. A club member, the multi-millionaire businessman Sir Hugo Drax, is winning considerable money playing bridge, seemingly against the odds. M suspects Drax is cheating, and while claiming indifference, is concerned as to why a multi-millionaire and national hero would cheat. Bond confirms Drax's deception and manages to turn the tables‚Äîaided by a stacked deck of cards‚Äîand wins ¬£15,000. Drax is the product of a mysterious background, purportedly unknown even to himself. Presumed to have been a British Army soldier during the Second World War, he was badly injured and stricken with amnesia in the explosion of a bomb planted by a German saboteur at a British field headquarters. After extensive rehabilitation in an army hospital, he returned home to become a wealthy industrialist. After building his fortune and establishing himself in business and society, Drax started building the \\"Moonraker\\", Britain's first nuclear missile project, intended to defend Britain against its Cold War enemies. The Moonraker rocket was to be an upgraded V-2 rocket using liquid hydrogen and fluorine as propellants; to withstand the ultra-high combustion temperatures of its engine, it used columbite, in which Drax had a monopoly. Because the rocket's engine could withstand high heat, the Moonraker was able to use these powerful fuels, greatly expanding its effective range. After a Ministry of Supply security officer working at the project is shot dead, M assigns Bond to replace him and also to investigate what has been going on at the missile-building base, located between Dover and Deal on the south coast of England. All the rocket scientists working on the project are German. At his post on the complex, Bond meets Gala Brand, a beautiful police Special Branch officer working undercover as Drax's personal assistant. Bond also uncovers clues concerning his predecessor's death, concluding that the man may have been killed for witnessing a submarine off the coast. Drax's henchman Krebs is caught by Bond snooping through his room. Later, an attempted assassination by triggering a landslide nearly kills Bond and Brand, as they swim beneath the Dover cliffs. Drax takes Brand to London, where she discovers the truth about the Moonraker by comparing her own launch trajectory figures with those in a notebook picked from Drax's pocket. She is captured by Krebs, and finds herself captive in a secret radio homing station‚Äîintended to serve as a beacon for the missile's guidance system‚Äîin the heart of London. While Brand is being taken back to the Moonraker facility by Drax, Bond gives chase, but is also captured by Drax and Krebs. Drax tells Bond that he was never a British soldier and has never suffered from amnesia: his real name is Graf Hugo von der Drache, the German commander of a Werwolf commando unit. He was the saboteur whose team placed the car bomb at the army field headquarters, only to be injured himself in the detonation. The amnesia story was simply a cover he used while recovering in hospital, in order to avoid Allied retribution, although it would lead to a whole new British identity. Drax remains a dedicated Nazi, bent on revenge against England for the wartime defeat of his Fatherland and his prior history of social slights suffered as a youth growing up in an English boarding school before the war. He explains that he now means to destroy London, with a Soviet-supplied nuclear warhead that has been secretly fitted to the Moonraker. He also plans to play the stock market the day before to make a huge profit from the imminent disaster. Brand and Bond are imprisoned where the blast from the Moonraker's engines will incinerate them, to leave no trace of them once the missile is launched. Before the launch, the couple escape. Brand gives Bond the coordinates he needs to redirect the gyros and send the Moonraker into the sea. Having been in collaboration with Soviet Intelligence all along, Drax and his henchman attempt to escape by Soviet submarine‚Äîonly to be killed as the vessel makes its escape through the waters onto which the Moonraker has been re-targeted. After their debriefing at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company‚Äîbut they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer. Background and writing history In early 1953 the film producer Alexander Korda read a proof copy of Live and Let Die, and informed its author, Ian Fleming, that he was excited by the book, but that it would not make a good basis for a film. Fleming told the producer that his next book was to be an expansion of an idea for a screenplay, set in London and Kent, adding that the location would allow \\"for some wonderful film settings\\". A V-2 rocket launch from summer 1943: the threat remembered from the war was the basis of the novel. Fleming undertook a significant amount of background research in preparation for writing Moonraker; he asked his fellow correspondent on The Sunday Times, Anthony Terry, for information on the Second World War German resistance force‚Äîthe Werewolves‚Äîand German V-2 rockets. The latter was a subject on which he wrote to the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and the British Interplanetary Society. Fleming also visited the Wimpole Street psychiatrist Eric Strauss to discuss the traits of megalomaniacs; Strauss lent him the book Men of Genius, which provided the link between megalomania and childhood thumb-sucking. Fleming used this information to give Drax diastema, a common result of thumb- sucking. According to his biographer Andrew Lycett, Fleming \\"wanted to make Moonraker his most ambitious and personal novel yet.\\" Fleming, a keen card player, was fascinated by the background to the 1890 royal baccarat scandal, and when in 1953 he met a woman who had been present at the game, he questioned her so intently that she burst into tears. In January 1954 Fleming and his wife, Ann, travelled to their Goldeneye estate in Jamaica for their annual two-month holiday. He had already written two Bond novels, Casino Royale, which had been published in April 1953, and Live and Let Die, whose publication was imminent. He began writing Moonraker on his arrival in the Caribbean. He later wrote an article for Books and Bookmen magazine describing his approach to writing, in which he said: \\"I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day.\\" By 24 February he had written over 30,000 words, although he wrote to a friend that he felt like he was already parodying the two earlier Bond novels. Fleming's own copy bears the following inscription, \\"This was written in January and February 1954 and published a year later. It is based on a film script I have had in my mind for many years.\\" He later said that the idea for the film had been too short for a full novel, and that he \\"had to more or less graft the first half of the book onto my film idea in order to bring it up to the necessary length\\". Fleming considered a number of titles for the story; his first choice had been The Moonraker, until No√´l Coward reminded him of a novel of the same name by F. Tennyson Jesse. Fleming then considered The Moonraker Secret, The Moonraker Plot, The Inhuman Element, Wide of the Mark, The Infernal Machine, Mondays are Hell and Out of the Clear Sky. George Wren Howard of Jonathan Cape suggested Bond & the Moonraker, The Moonraker Scare and The Moonraker Plan, while his friend, the writer William Plomer, suggested Hell is Here; the final choice of Moonraker was a suggestion by Wren Howard. Although Fleming provided no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor‚Äîboth of whom have written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications‚Äîput the events of Moonraker in 1953; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story to have taken place in May of that year. Development=Plot inspirations= Boodle's, a gentlemen's club in London, was the model for Blades; Fleming was a member of three clubs, including Boodle's. The locations draw from Fleming's personal experiences. Moonraker is the only Bond novel that takes place solely in Britain, which gave Fleming the chance to write about the England he cherished, such as the Kent countryside, including the White Cliffs of Dover, and London clubland. Fleming owned a cottage in St Margaret's at Cliffe, near Dover, and he went to great lengths to get the details of the area right, including lending his car to his stepson to time the journey from London to Deal for the car chase passage. Fleming used his experiences of London clubs for the background of the Blades scenes. As a clubman, he enjoyed membership of Boodle's, White's and the Portland Club, and a combination of Boodles and the Portland Club is thought to be the model for Blades; the author Michael Dibdin found the scene in the club to be \\"surely one of the finest things that Ian Fleming ever did.\\" The early chapters of the novel centre on Bond's private life, with Fleming using his own lifestyle as a basis for Bond's. Fleming used further aspects of his private life, such as his friends, as he had done in his previous novels: Hugo Drax was named after his brother-in-law Hugo Charteris and a navy acquaintance Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, while Fleming's friend Duff Sutherland (described as \\"a scruffy looking chap\\") was one of the bridge players at Blades. The name of the Scotland Yard superintendent, Ronnie Vallance, was made up from those of Ronald Howe, the actual assistant commissioner at the Yard, and of Vallance Lodge & Co., Fleming's accountants. Other elements of the plot came from Fleming's knowledge of wartime operations carried out by T-Force, a secret British Army unit formed to continue the work of the Fleming-established 30 Assault Unit. =Characters= According to the author Raymond Benson, Moonraker is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming's previous work, which allows the author to develop the characters further. As such, Bond \\"becomes something more than ... [the] cardboard figure\\" that he had been in the previous two novels. The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines, which Fleming describes as \\"Elastic office hours from around ten until six, ... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends, ... or making love, with rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married women.\\" This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming's own, which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing \\"a sourness\\" in the author's character. According to Chancellor, two of Bond's other vices were also displayed in the book: his fondness for gambling‚Äîillegal except in private members clubs in 1955‚Äîand excessive drink and drug taking, neither of which were frowned upon in post-war upper class circles. In preparation for beating Drax at cards, Bond consumes a vodka martini, a carafe of vodka shared with M, two bottles of champagne and a brandy; he also mixes a quantity of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, into a glass of the champagne. According to The Times journalist and historian Ben Macintyre, to Fleming the alcohol consumption \\"meant relaxation, ritual and reliability\\". Benzedrine was regularly taken by troops during the war to remain awake and alert, and Fleming was an occasional consumer. Drax is physically abnormal, as are many of Bond's later adversaries. He has very broad shoulders, a large head and protruding teeth with diastema; his face is badly scarred from a wartime explosion. According to the writers Kingsley Amis and Benson‚Äîboth of whom subsequently wrote Bond novels‚ÄîDrax is the most successful villain in the Bond canon. Amis considers this to be \\"because the most imagination and energy has gone into his portrayal. He lives in the real world ... [and] his physical presence fills Moonraker. The view is shared by Chancellor, who considers Drax \\"perhaps the most believable\\" of all Fleming's villains. The cultural historian Jeremy Black writes that as with Le Chiffre and Mr Big‚Äîthe villains of the first two Bond novels‚ÄîDrax's origins and war history are vital to an understanding of the character. Like several other antagonists in the Bond canon, Drax was German, reminding readers of a familiar threat in 1950s Britain. Because Drax is without a girlfriend or wife he is, according to the norms of Fleming and his works, abnormal in Bond's world. Benson considers Brand to be one of the weakest female roles in the Bond canon and \\"a throwback to the rather stiff characterization of Vesper Lynd\\" from Casino Royale. Brand's lack of interest in Bond removes sexual tension from the novel; she is unique in the canon for being the one woman that Bond does not seduce. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett write that the perceived reserve shown by Brand to Bond was not due to frigidity, but to her engagement to a fellow police officer. M is another character who is more fully realised than in the previous novels, and for the first time in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show ¬£100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head of the Secret Service is ¬£6,500 a year. Style Benson analysed Fleming's writing style and identified what he described as the \\"Fleming Sweep\\": a stylistic technique that sweeps the reader from one chapter to another using 'hooks' at the end of each chapter to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next: Benson feels that the sweep in Moonraker was not as pronounced as Fleming's previous works, largely due to the lack of action sequences in the novel. According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek, in his examination of 20th-century British spy novels, in Moonraker Fleming uses a technique closer to the detective story than to the thriller genre. This manifests itself in Fleming placing clues to the plot line throughout the story, and leaving Drax's unveiling of his plan until the later chapters. Black sees that the pace of the novel is set by the launch of the rocket (there are four days between Bond's briefing by M and the launch) while Amis considers that the story to have a \\"rather hurried\\" ending. Moonraker uses a literary device Fleming employs elsewhere, that of having a seemingly trivial incident between the main characters‚Äîthe card game‚Äîthat leads to the uncovering of a greater incident‚Äîthe main plot involving the rocket. Dibdin sees gambling as the common link, thus the card game acts as an \\"introduction to the ensuing encounter ... for even higher stakes\\". Savoye sees this concept of competition between Bond and villain as a \\"notion of game and the eternal fight between Order and Disorder\\", common throughout the Bond stories. Themes The \\"totemic significance\\" of the White Cliffs of Dover helps make Moonraker \\"the most British of the Bond novels\\", according to Black. Parker describes the novel as \\"a hymn to England\\", and highlights Fleming's description of the white cliffs of Dover and the heart of London as evidence. Even the German Krebs is moved by the sight of the Kent countryside in a country he hates. The novel places England‚Äîand particularly London and Kent‚Äîin the front line of the cold war, and the threat to the location further emphasises its importance. Bennett and Woollacott consider that Moonraker defines the strengths and virtues of England and Englishness as being the \\"quiet and orderly background of English institutions\\", which are threatened by the disturbance Drax brings. The literary critic Meir Sternberg considers the theme of English identity can be seen in the confrontation between Drax and Bond. Drax‚Äîwhose real name is German for dragon‚Äîis in opposition to Bond, who takes the role of Saint George in the conflict. As with Casino Royale and Live and Let Die, Moonraker involves the idea of the \\"traitor within\\". Drax, real name Graf Hugo von der Drache, is a \\"megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman\\", while Krebs bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff. Black sees that, in using a German as the novel's main enemy, \\"Fleming ... exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.\\" Moonraker uses two of the foes feared by Fleming, the Nazis and the Soviets, with Drax being German and working for the Soviets; in Moonraker the Soviets were hostile and provided not just the atomic bomb, but support and logistics to Drax. Moonraker played on fears of the audiences of the 1950s of rocket attacks from overseas, fears grounded in the use of the V-2 rocket by the Nazis during the Second World War. The story takes the threat one stage further, with a rocket based on English soil, aimed at London and \\"the end of British invulnerability\\". Publication and reception=Publication history= Moonraker was published in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies before the end of the year. In December that year the US paperback was published under the title Too Hot to Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print. =Reception= No√´l Coward considered Moonraker the best of the first three Bond novels. Fleming's friend‚Äîand neighbour in Jamaica‚ÄîNo√´l Coward considered Moonraker to be the best thing Fleming had written to that point: \\"although as usual too far-fetched, not quite so much so as the last two ... His observation is extraordinary and his talent for description vivid.\\" Fleming received numerous letters from readers complaining about the lack of exotic locations; one of which protested \\"We want taking out of ourselves, not sitting on the beach in Dover.\\" Julian Symons, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, found Moonraker \\"a disappointment\\", and considered that \\"Fleming's tendency ... to parody the form of the thriller, has taken charge in the second half of this story.\\" Maurice Richardson, in his review for The Observer, was more welcoming: \\"Do not miss this\\", he urged, saying that \\"Mr. Fleming continues to be irresistibly readable, however incredible\\". Hilary Corke, writing in The Listener, thought that \\"Fleming is one of the most accomplished of thriller-writers\\", and considered that Moonraker \\"is as mercilessly readable as all the rest\\". Corke warned Fleming away from being over-dramatic, declaring that \\"Mr Fleming is evidently far too accomplished to need to lean upon these blood-and-thunder devices: he could keep our hair on end for three hundred pages without spilling more blood than was allowed to Shylock.\\" The reviewer in The Scotsman considered that Fleming \\"administers stimuli with no mean hand ... 'Astonish me!' the addict may challenge: Mr Fleming can knock him sideways.\\" John Metcalf for The Spectator thought the book \\"utterly disgraceful‚Äîand highly enjoyable ... without [Moonraker] no forthcoming railway journey should be undertaken\\", although he also considered that it was \\"not one of Mr. Fleming's best\\". Anthony Boucher, writing in The New York Times, was equivocal, saying \\"I don't know anyone who writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming and I only wish the other parts of his books lived up to their gambling sequences\\". Richard Lister in the New Statesman thought that \\"Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing.\\" Writing for The Washington Post, Al Manola believed that the \\"British tradition of rich mystery writing, copious description and sturdy heroism all blend nicely\\" in Moonraker, providing what he considered was \\"probably the best action novel of the month\\". Adaptations Roger Moore appeared as Bond in the 1979 adaptation of Moonraker. The actor John Payne attempted to take up the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the attempt. The Rank Organisation also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise fell through. The novel was not one of Fleming's stories acquired by Eon Productions in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired the rights and commissioned Gerry Anderson to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and Tony Barwick prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of The Spy Who Loved Me. The first adaptation of Moonraker was for South African radio in 1956, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond. According to The Independent, \\"listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob's cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination\\". The novel was adapted as a comic strip that was published in the Daily Express newspaper and syndicated worldwide. The adaptation was written by Henry Gammidge and illustrated by John McLusky, and ran daily from 30 March to 8 August 1959. Titan Books reprinted the strip in 2005 along with Casino Royale and Live and Let Die as a part of the Casino Royale anthology. \\"Moonraker\\" was used as the title for the eleventh James Bond film, produced by Eon Productions and released in 1979. Directed by Lewis Gilbert and produced by Albert R. Broccoli, the film features Roger Moore in his fourth appearance as Bond. The Nazi-inspired element of Drax's motivation in the novel was indirectly preserved with the \\"master race\\" theme of the film's plot. Since the screenplay was original, Eon Productions and Glidrose Publications authorised the film's writer, Christopher Wood, to produce his second novelization based on a film; this was entitled James Bond and Moonraker. Elements of Moonraker were also used in the 2002 film Die Another Day, with a scene set in the Blades club. The actress Rosamund Pike, who plays Miranda Frost in the film, later said that her character was originally to have been named Gala Brand.

This spanned the Kingdom of Ireland (1541‚Äì1800) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801‚Äì1922). The office, under its various names, was often more generally known as the Viceroy, and his wife was known as the vicereine. The government of Ireland in practice was usually in the hands of the Lord Deputy up to the 17th century, and later of the Chief Secretary for Ireland. Although in the Middle Ages some Lords Deputy were Irish noblemen, only men from Great Britain, usually peers, were appointed to the office of Lord Lieutenant. Role The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland was the ex officio Grand Master of the Order of St Patrick (uniform shown here worn by William Ward, 2nd Earl of Dudley, Lord Lieutenant from 1902 to 1905). The Lord Lieutenant possessed a number of overlapping roles. He was * the representative of the King (the \\"viceroy\\"); * the head of the executive in Ireland; * (on occasion) a member of the English or British Cabinet; * the fount of mercy, justice and patronage; * (on occasion) commander-in-chief in Ireland. * Grand Master of the Order of St. Patrick Prior to the Act of Union 1800 which abolished the Irish parliament, the Lord Lieutenant formally delivered the Speech from the Throne outlining his Government's policies. His Government exercised effective control of parliament through the extensive exercise of the powers of patronage, namely the awarding of peerages, baronetcies and state honours. Critics accused successive viceroys of using their patronage power as a corrupt means of controlling parliament. On one day in July 1777, Lord Buckinghamshire as Lord Lieutenant promoted 5 viscounts to earls, 7 barons to viscounts, and created 18 new barons. The power of patronage was used to bribe MPs and peers into supporting the Act of Union 1800, with many of those who changed sides and supported the Union in Parliament awarded peerages and honours for doing so. Constitutional structure The Lord Lieutenant was advised in the governance by the Irish Privy Council, a body of appointed figures and hereditary title holders, which met in the Council Chamber in Dublin Castle and on occasion in other locations. The chief constitutional figures in the viceregal court were: * Chief Secretary for Ireland: From 1660, originally the chief administrator, but by the end of the 19th century effectively the prime minister in the administration, with the Lord Lieutenant becoming a form of constitutional monarch. * Under-Secretary for Ireland: The head of the civil service in Ireland. * Lord Justices: Three office-holders who acted in the Lord Lieutenant's stead during his absence. The Lord Justices were before 1800 the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, and the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh as Primate of All Ireland. Lords Lieutenant were appointed for no set term but served for \\"His/Her Majesty's pleasure\\" (in reality, as long as wished by the British government). When a ministry fell, the Lord Lieutenant was usually replaced by a supporter of the new ministry. Officeholders Until the 16th century, Irish or Anglo-Irish noblemen such as the 8th Earl of Kildare and the 9th Earl of Kildare traditionally held the post of Justiciar or Lord Deputy. Following the plantations, however, noblemen from Great Britain were given the post. The last Irish Catholic to hold the position was Lord Tyrconnell from 1685‚Äì91, during the brief Catholic Ascendancy in the reign of James II that was ended by the Williamite war in Ireland. Until 1767 none of the latter lived full- time in Ireland. Instead they resided in Ireland during meetings of the Irish Parliament (a number of months every two years). However the British cabinet decided in 1765 that full-time residency should be required to enable the Lord Lieutenant to keep a full-time eye on public affairs in Ireland.Joseph Robins, Champagne and Silver Buckles: The Viceregal Court at Dublin Castle 1700‚Äì1922 p.56 (Lillyput Press, 2001) In addition to the restriction that only English or British noblemen could be appointed to the viceroyalty, a further restriction following the Glorious Revolution excluded Roman Catholics, though it was the faith of the overwhelming majority on the island of Ireland, from holding the office. The office was restricted to members of the Anglican faith. The first Catholic appointed to the post since the reign of the Catholic King James II was in fact the last viceroy, Lord FitzAlan of Derwent, in April 1921. His appointment was possible because the Government of Ireland Act 1920 ended the prohibition on Catholics being appointed to the position. FitzAlan was also the only Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to hold office when Ireland was partitioned into Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland. Importance of the post The post ebbed and flowed in importance, being used on occasion as a form of exile for prominent British politicians who had fallen afoul of the Court of St. James's or Westminster. On other occasions it was a stepping stone to a future career. Two Lords Lieutenant, Lord Hartington and the Duke of Portland, went from Dublin Castle to 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Great Britain, in 1756 and 1783 respectively. By the mid-to- late 19th century the post had declined from being a powerful political office to that of being a symbolic quasi-monarchical figure who reigned, not ruled, over the Irish administration. Instead it was the Chief Secretary for Ireland who became central, with he, not the Lord Lieutenant, sitting on occasion in the British cabinet. Official residence The Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle ‚Äì the official 'season' residence of the Lord Lieutenant The official residence of the Lord Lieutenant was the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle, where the Viceregal Court was based. Other summer or alternative residences used by Lord Lieutenant or Lords Deputy included Abbeville in Kinsealy, Chapelizod House, in which the Lord Lieutenant lived while Dublin Castle was being rebuilt following a fire but which he left due to the building being supposedly haunted, Leixlip Castle and St. Wolstan's in Celbridge. The Geraldine Lords Deputy, the 8th Earl of Kildare and the 9th Earl of Kildare, being native Irish, both lived in, among other locations, their castle in Maynooth, County Kildare. Lord Essex owned Durhamstown Castle near Navan in County Meath, a short distance from the residence of the Lord Bishop of Meath at Ardbraccan House. The decision to require the Lord Lieutenant to live full-time in Ireland necessitated a change in living arrangements. As the location of the Viceregal Court, the Privy Council and of various governmental offices, Dublin Castle became a less than desirable full- time residence for the viceroy, vicereine and their family. In 1781 the British government bought the former ranger's house in Phoenix Park to act as a personal residence for the Lord Lieutenant. The building was rebuilt and named the Viceregal Lodge. It was not however until major renovations in the 1820s that the Lodge came to be used regularly by viceroys. It is now known as √Åras an Uachtar√°in and is the residence of the President of Ireland. By the mid-19th century, Lords Lieutenant lived in the Castle only during the Social Season (early January to St. Patrick's Day, 17 March), during which time they held social events; balls, drawing rooms, etc. By tradition the coat of arms of each Lord Lieutenant was displayed somewhere in the Chapel Royal in Dublin Castle; some were incorporated into stained glass windows, some carved into seating, etc. Irish attitudes pew in St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin The office of Lord Lieutenant, like the British government in Ireland, was greatly resented by some Irish nationalists, though it was supported with varying degrees of enthusiasm by the minority Irish unionist community. Some Lords Lieutenant did earn a measure of popularity in a personal capacity among nationalists. From the early 19th century, calls were made frequently for the abolition of the office and its replacement by a \\"Secretary of State for Ireland\\". Though on one occasion, a Bill was introduced by one government to make this change, the office survived until the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. Irish nationalists throughout the 19th century and early 20th century campaigned for a form of Irish self-government. Daniel O'Connell sought repeal of the Act of Union, while later nationalists such as Charles Stewart Parnell sought a lesser measure, known as home rule. All four Home Rule bills provided for the continuation of the office. Abolition The Government of Ireland Act 1920 divided Ireland into two devolved entities inside the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. Two institutions were meant to join the two; a Council of Ireland (which was hoped would evolve into a working all-Ireland parliament) and the Lord Lieutenant who would be the nominal chief executive of both regimes, appointing both prime ministers and dissolving both parliaments. In fact only Northern Ireland functioned, with Southern Ireland being quickly replaced by the Irish Free State with its own Governor-General. The Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 provided that, once the Parliament of Northern Ireland opted out of the Free State, the office of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland would be abolished and its residual powers transferred to the new position of Governor of Northern Ireland. This duly happened on 8 December 1922, two days after the Free State Constitution came into force.

Collingwood played in back- to-back grand-finals (2002‚Äì03) within three years of his appointment. 2010 brought \\"tears of joy\\" for McGuire when Collingwood defeated St Kilda in the AFL Grand Final replay. The first match resulted in a draw, prompting McGuire to say before the replay that \\"he had seen more drawn Collingwood Grand Finals (1977 and 2010) than he had seen premierships\\". CEO of the Nine Network On 9 February 2006, it was announced that McGuire would become the new CEO of the Nine Network, filling a vacancy created by the departure of David Gyngell in May 2005. McGuire had to sacrifice his on-air commitments including hosting The AFL Footy Show and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, as well as AFL commentary, for what turned out to be a very short term tenure. According to Business Review Weekly McGuire's on-air salary was $3.5 million a year. Gyngell had earned $1.1 million a year by comparison. According to the 2006 PBL annual report, McGuire was reported to be on a $4 million fixed remuneration contract. In May 2006, McGuire travelled to Beaconsfield, Tasmania, to rally Nine News reporters covering the mine collapse. McGuire came out of on-air retirement to host the event, which was broadcast as part of The AFL Footy Show (both versions). Before leaving for the Munich edition of The Footy Show, he announced the elimination of 100 jobs, most in news and current affairs. Despite a vigorous publicity campaign by the CEO these cost- cutting measures severely damaged morale at the network. On one program, McGuire's required job-cuts exceeded the actual number of employees. This raised questions in both the media and within Channel 9 itself about the competence of Nine's executives. The troubles worsened when an affidavit written by a Channel 9 executive affected by the purges was leaked to the press and Nine failed in its attempts to suppress it. It contained allegations regarding McGuire's treatment of employees. The document's author, Mark Llewellyn (previous head of news and current affairs who has since found work at Channel 7), claimed that McGuire and his staff had told him that he would be forced to \\"eat a shit sandwich\\" (accept a dramatic pay-cut). He also recalled conversations with McGuire where the CEO had spoken of wanting to \\"bone\\" (reported to mean \\"fire\\") Jessica Rowe, co-host of the network's Today show. Following these allegations McGuire guaranteed Rowe her position on the program. McGuire has never denied the allegations. On 6 May 2007, Llewellyn's position was vindicated when it was announced that Jessica Rowe would not be returning to Channel 9. McGuire's decision to force Jana Wendt off the Sunday program backfired with the relaunch of the show on 3 September 2006.

This episode was considered by many in the media as a failure by the 'P-plated CEO' (a term coined by Sydney tabloids) to manage the network in a professional and ethical manner. It also fuelled speculation as to his longevity in his position as CEO of Nine. On 30 June 2007, McGuire resigned as CEO of the Nine Network and took on a new position in programming services as well as more on-screen roles. Summer Olympics (London) During the 2012 London Olympics, McGuire presented his Triple M radio program from London each weekday. In addition, he called events for the Nine Network and Foxtel and co- hosted the opening and closing ceremonies with Leila McKinnon. McGuire and McKinnon's commentary of the Olympic opening ceremony was widely criticised in newspapers and on Twitter. Errors including spoilers before surprise appearances, ill-timed remarks, reference to the Peter Pan character Captain Hook as Captain Cook, and Abraham Lincoln as a prime minister of the United Kingdom. The McGuire and McKinnon commentary was not used for Foxtel's coverage of the opening ceremony.

During the second half of the century, Peruvian literature became more widely known because of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa, a leading member of the Latin American Boom.Gerald Martin, \\"Narrative since c. 1920\\", pp. 186-188. ArtArchitecture thumbrightHuacas del Sol y de la Luna, located six kilometers south from Trujillo Peruvian architecture is a conjunction of European styles exposed to the influence of indigenous imagery. Two of the most well-known examples of the Early Colonial period are the Cathedral of Cusco and the Church of Santa Clara of Cuzco. After this period, the mestization reached its richer expression in the Baroque. Some examples of this Baroque period are the Convento de San Francisco, the Iglesia de la Compa√±√≠a, and the facade of the University of Cuzco and, overall, the churches of San Agust√≠n and Santa Rosa of Arequipa. Although these later examples are rarer; the Independence War left a creative emptiness that was filled by the Neoclassicism. The 20th century was characterized by the eclectic architecture, which has been in stark opposition to constructive functionalism. Its considerable example is San Martin Plaza in Lima. Music A Peruvian man playing the zampo√±a. Peruvian music is an amalgamation of sounds and styles drawing on the Peru's Andean music roots and influenced by Quechua, Aymara and Spanish music. Celebrations sling made of alpaca hair Popular celebrations are the product of every town's traditions and legends. These celebrations include music, meals and typical drinks. In addition to the religious celebrations like Christmas and Corpus Christi, there are others that express the syncretism of the indigenous beliefs with the Christians. An example is the Marinera which is one of the main dances found in Peru. Many families find it fascinating to watch a performance. They also have a guinea pig festival each year. Sports Claudio Pizarro, former captain of the Peru national football team. Football is the most popular sport in Peru. Football in Peru is governed by the Peruvian Football Federation (PFF), which organizes the men's and women's national teams. Football legends from Peru include Alejandro Villanueva, Teodoro Fern√°ndez, Valeriano L√≥pez, Alberto Terry, Hugo Sotil, C√©sar Cueto, Roberto Challe, H√©ctor Chumpitaz and Te√≥filo Cubillas, Peru's most successful striker in the World Cup finals with ten goals. Nolberto Solano Current renowned players include defender Carlos Zambrano (Rubin Kazan), midfielder Juan Manuel Vargas (Universitario) and strikers Claudio Pizarro (Werder Bremen), Paolo Guerrero (Flamengo) and Jefferson Farf√°n (Lokomotiv Moscow). Alianza Lima, Sporting Cristal and Universitario de Deportes are the biggest teams in Peru. In 2003, Cienciano won the Copa Sudamericana after defeating Argentinian club River Plate, and then proceeded to beat Latin American powerhouse Boca Juniors (also from Argentina) in the Recopa Sudamericana played in Miami. Sporting Cristal was finalist in the Copa Libertadores de Am√©rica 1997, South America's most important football tournament. Also Universitario de Deportes, but in 1972. Achievements from the Peru national football team include competing at the FIFA World Cup, in 1930, 1970 (Quarterfinalists), 1978, and 1982, being Te√≥filo Cubillas, among the top 10 goal scorers in the history of the World Cup and having a record as the only player to score 5 goals in 2 different World Cups. The national team won two Copa Am√©rica's in 1939 and 1975. Claudio Pizarro holds the record as the top scorer from a foreign country in the history of Bundesliga. Paolo Guerrero holds the record as the current all time top scorer in the history of the Copa Am√©rica still active, finishing as the top scorer in all three of these tournaments (2011, 2015 and 2019), which is also a record. 180px Achievements from the Peru women's national football team include finishing third place at the 1998 Sudamericano Femenino, and finishing fourth place at the 2003 Sudamericano Femenino. Women's volleyball is a popular and also successful sport in Peru (Silver medal in the 1988 Summer Olympics, Runners-up in the Volleyball World Championship, and 14 times South American Champion). Tennis, Surfing and Rugby in Peru are a minor, but growing sports. Sof√≠a Mul√°novich is the first South American ever to win the Surfing World Title, which she did in 2004. She is also the first Peruvian surfer ever to win a World Surf League World Championship Tour event. In 2004, she won three out of the six World Championship Tour events, and finished the season as World Champion. Cuisine Ceviche, the national dish of Peru Peru has a varied cuisine with ingredients like maize, tomato, potatoes, uchu or Aj√≠ (Capsicum pubescens), oca, ulluco, avocado, fruits such as chirimoya, l√∫cuma and pineapple, and animals like taruca (Hippocamelus antisensis), llama and guinea pig (called cuy). The combination of Inca and Spanish culinary traditions, resulted in new meals and ways of preparing them. The arrival of African and Chinese immigrants in the 19th century also resulted in the development of Creole cuisine in the city of Lima, where the vast majority of these immigrants settled. Some typical Peruvian dishes are ceviche (fish and shellfish marinated in citrus juice), chupe de camarones (a soup made of shrimp known as cryphiops caementarius), anticuchos (cow's heart roasted en brochette), olluco con charqui (a casserole dish made of ulluco and charqui), pachamanca (meat, tubers and beans cooked in a stone oven), lomo saltado (meat fried lightly with tomato and onion, served with french fries and rice) that has a Chinese influence, and the picante de cuy (a casserole dish made of fried guinea pig with some spices). Peruvian food can be accompanied by typical drinks like the chicha de jora (a chicha made of tender corn dried by the sun). There are also chichas made of purple corn or peanuts.

Together with Doug Clifford, Stu Cook, and his brother Tom Fogerty, he founded the band Creedence Clearwater Revival (\\"CCR\\"), for which he was the lead singer, lead guitarist, and principal songwriter. The group had nine top-10 singles and eight gold albums between 1968 and 1972, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Since CCR parted ways in 1972, Fogerty has had a successful solo career, which continues as of 2020. He was listed on Rolling Stone magazine's list of 100 Greatest Songwriters (at number 40) and the list of 100 Greatest Singers (at number 72). His songs include \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Bad Moon Rising\\", \\"Fortunate Son\\", \\"Green River\\", \\"Down on the Corner\\", \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\", and \\"Centerfield\\". Early life Fogerty was born in Berkeley, California, and grew up in El Cerrito, California, one of five sons born to Galen Robert and Edith Lucile Fogerty. His father was a native of South Dakota, and worked as a Linotype operator for the Berkeley Gazette in California. Lucile Fogerty taught 2nd grade and was from Great Falls, Montana. He first attended a Catholic school, the School of the Madeleine, in Berkeley California. In his memoir, Fortunate Son, Fogerty was critical of the school, saying when in class he was not permitted to go to the bathroom when he asked, and frequently wet himself and was forced to sit in his wet clothing. After one year, Fogerty enrolled in nearby Harding Grammar School. In his book, he stated that his parents were alcoholics and that they divorced when he was in the third or fourth grade. He later attended St. Mary's High School, then transferred to El Cerrito High School, where he met the other future members of CCR and took guitar lessons from Berkeley Folk Festival creator/producer Barry Olivier. Fogerty's older brother Tom was a guitarist and bandmate in the group that eventually became CCR. Fogerty spent summer vacations at Putah Creek, near Winters, California, which became the subject of the CCR song \\"Green River\\".Thompson, Art. \\"John Fogerty Summons His Creedence-Era Spirit on Revival\\"Greene, Andy. Q&A;: John Fogerty on All-Star Duets LP, Unlikely Creedence Reunion, Rolling Stone, May 4, 2012. While in junior high school in 1959, Fogerty formed a cover band with bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford called the Blue Velvets. The band was inspired by rock and roll pioneers, especially Little Richard and Bo Diddley. Later, Fogerty's brother Tom joined the group. In 1964, the band signed with Fantasy Records, which without the band's knowledge or approval, changed the band's name from the Blue Velvets to The Golliwogs. This group recorded seven singles that were not commercially successful.  Military service  Fogerty received his draft notice for military service during the Vietnam War in 1966. The same day he received the notice, he went to a local United States Army Reserve recruiter, who signed him up immediately for training as a supply clerk. Fogerty believes the recruiter dated the paperwork to take effect before the draft letter arrived. During his time in the Army Reserve, Fogerty attended training at Fort Bragg, Fort Knox, and Fort Lee. He completed his active duty for training in July 1967, then served as a part-time reservist until being discharged in 1968.  Creedence Clearwater Revival (1968‚Äì1972)  After Fogerty's military service, the Golliwogs resumed playing, releasing an album in late 1967. In 1968, they changed their name to Creedence Clearwater Revival, with John Fogerty taking his brother's place as lead singer. The band released their eponymous debut album and also had their first hit single, \\"Susie Q\\". Many other hit singles and albums followed, beginning with \\"Proud Mary\\" and the album Bayou Country. Fogerty, as writer of the songs for the band as well as lead singer and lead guitarist, felt that his musical opinions should count for more than those of the others, leading to resentments within the band. These internal rifts, and Tom's feeling that he was being taken for granted, caused Tom to leave the group in January 1971. The two other group members, bassist Cook and drummer Clifford, wanted a greater role in the band's future. Fogerty, in an attempt to keep things together, insisted Cook and Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on what became the band's final album, Mardi Gras, released in April 1972, which included the band's last two singles, the 1971 hit \\"Sweet Hitch-Hiker\\", and \\"Someday Never Comes\\", which made it into the Billboard Top 20. Cook and Clifford told Fogerty that the fans would not accept Mardi Gras as a CCR LP, but Fogerty told them, \\"My voice is a unique instrument, and I will not lend it to your songs.\\" Fogerty gave them an ultimatum: either they would do it or Fogerty would quit immediately. They accepted Fogerty's ultimatum. The album received poor reviews, but was a commercial success, peaking at number 12 and achieving gold-record status. It did, however, generate weaker sales than previous albums. The group disbanded shortly after the album was released. The only reunion of all four original members was at Tom Fogerty's wedding in 1980. Fogerty, Clifford, and Cook played a 45-minute set at their 20th El Cerrito high school class reunion in 1983, and Fogerty and Clifford were reunited again for a brief set at their 25th class reunion. Even early in his career, ‚ÄúFogerty‚Äôs attitude toward music [was] serious, practiced, even perfectionistic. He drilled his bandmates in rehearsal after rehearsal, insisting that his songs be performed his way. ‚Ä¶[He] was known for not indulging in drugs, and although John struggled with alcohol later in life he had only contempt for musicians whose habits interfered with their performances.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot in my band,‚Äù he writes in his memoir, Fortunate Son. ‚ÄúYou dare not be stoned playing music around me.... When you‚Äôre working, you‚Äôre supposed to be working.‚Äù  Solo career =1972‚Äì1985= As CCR was coming to an end, Fogerty began working on a solo album of country and western covers, on which he produced, arranged, and played all of the instruments. Despite the solo nature of the recordings, however, Fogerty elected to credit the album to The Blue Ridge Rangers‚Äîa band of which he was the only member. The eponymous The Blue Ridge Rangers was released in 1973; it spun off the top-20 hit \\"Jambalaya\\", as well as a lesser hit in \\"Hearts Of Stone\\". Fogerty, still using \\"The Blue Ridge Rangers\\" name, then released a self-penned rock- and-roll single: \\"You Don't Owe Me\\" b/w \\"Back in the Hills\\" (Fantasy F-710). It was a commercial flop, failing to make the Hot 100 in the U.S., though \\"You Don't Owe Me\\" was a minor hit in Canada, reaching number 79. Fogerty thereafter abandoned the \\"Blue Ridge Rangers\\" identity, and released all his subsequent work under his own name. In early 1974, Fogerty released \\"Comin' Down The Road\\"--backed with the instrumental \\"Ricochet\\". His first official solo album, John Fogerty, was released in 1975. Sales were slim and legal problems delayed a follow-up, though it yielded \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\", a number-27 hit for Fogerty in the United States. In 1977, British boogie rockers Status Quo recorded their version of \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\", which became a huge hit and made the song world-famous. Status Quo played it at the opening of the 1985 Live Aid concert. In 1976, Fogerty finished an album called Hoodoo. A single, \\"You Got The Magic\\" backed with \\"Evil Thing\\", preceded the album's release, but it performed poorly. The album, for which covers had already been printed, was rejected by Asylum Records a few weeks before its scheduled release, and Fogerty agreed that it was not up to his usual high standards. Fogerty told Asylum Records to destroy the master tapes for Hoodoo sometime in the 1980s. =1985‚Äì1997= After a hiatus of several years from the music industry, Fogerty's solo career re-emerged with 1985's Centerfield, his first album for Warner Bros. Records, which had taken co- ownership of Asylum's contract with Fogerty. Centerfield went to the top of the charts and included a top-10 hit in \\"The Old Man Down the Road.\\" The title track is frequently played on classic rock radio and at baseball games to this day, but the album led to legal problems for Fogerty. Two songs on the album, \\"Zanz Kant Danz\\" and \\"Mr. Greed,\\" were believed to be attacks on Fogerty's former boss at Fantasy Records, Saul Zaentz. \\"Zanz Kant Danz\\" was about a pig that cannot dance, but would \\"steal your money\\". When Zaentz responded with a lawsuit, Fogerty issued a revised version: \\"Vanz Kant Danz\\" (changing the lead character's name to Vanz). Another lawsuit (Fantasy, Inc. v. Fogerty) claimed that \\"The Old Man Down The Road\\" shared the same chorus as \\"Run Through the Jungle\\", a song from Fogerty's days with CCR to which Fantasy Records still owned the publishing rights. Fogerty ultimately won his case when he proved that the two songs were distinct compositions. Fogerty then countersued for attorney fees (Fogerty v. Fantasy). After losing in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Fogerty won his case in the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that a trial court has discretion in awarding fees to defendants or plaintiffs. On May 31, 1985, Fogerty filmed a one-hour music and interview special for Showtime called John Fogerty's All-Stars. The set list consisted of rhythm and blues tunes from the 1960s, as well as material from the Centerfield LP and the song \\"No Love in You\\" written by Michael Anderson, which Fogerty found on the Textones' debut album Midnight Mission and he later recorded with Textones' band leader Carla Olson. John Fogerty's All-Stars was recorded in front of an audience of Warners Bros. Music employees and other invited guests at A&M; Records on La Brea in Hollywood. The band included Albert Lee, Booker T. Jones, Duck Dunn, Steve Douglas, and Prairie Prince. The follow-up album to Centerfield was Eye of the Zombie in 1986, but it was significantly less successful than its predecessor. Fogerty toured behind the album, but he refused to play any CCR material. Eye of the Zombie took on a darker mood, talking about a troubled society, terrorism, and pop stars selling out. For over 20 years after the Eye of the Zombie tour ended in late 1986, Fogerty refused to play material from the album in concert. However, \\"Change in the Weather\\" was included in the set list for his 2009 tour, and it was even re- recorded for that year's solo release, The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again. Fogerty played CCR material again at a concert in Washington, DC, for Vietnam veterans that took place on July 4, 1987. The show was aired on HBO. Aside from a guest appearance at the Palomino and performance at the 1986 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, this was the first time Fogerty had performed any Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a large audience since 1972. On May 27, 1989, he played a set of CCR material at Oakland Coliseum for the Concert Against AIDS. His backing band that night consisted of Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir on guitars, Randy Jackson on bass, and Steve Jordan on drums. In 1990, Tom Fogerty died of complications from AIDS at the age of 48, specifically from a tuberculosis infection, having contracted HIV from blood transfusions during surgery for a back ailment. John Fogerty has mentioned that the darkest moments in his life were when his brother took the record company's side in their royalties dispute, and the fact that when his brother died, the two of them were not speaking to each other.VH1 Legends: John Fogerty--Viacom International, VH1, 1996 In the eulogy he delivered at Tom's funeral, he said: \\"We wanted to grow up and be musicians. I guess we achieved half of that, becoming rock 'n roll stars. We didn't necessarily grow up.\\" Fogerty traveled to Mississippi in 1990 for inspiration, and visited the gravesite of blues legend Robert Johnson. According to him, while there, he had the realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, thus Fogerty decided to start making a new album and to perform his old CCR material regularly in concert. At this time, visiting the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church cemetery, Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation, the Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty subsequently funded headstones for Charlie Patton, James Son Thomas, Mississippi Joe Callicott, Eugene Powell, and Lonnie Pitchford, and helped with financial arrangements for numerous others. Creedence Clearwater Revival was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Fogerty refused to perform with his former bandmates and fellow inductees Stu Cook and Doug Clifford during the musical portion of the induction ceremony. In place of the surviving members of CCR, Fogerty recruited session musicians on drums and bass and was also joined by Bruce Springsteen and Robbie Robertson in performing three songs: \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\", \\"Born on the Bayou\\", and \\"Green River\\". During the induction speech, Springsteen said, \\"As a songwriter, only a few did as much in three minutes [as John Fogerty]. He was an Old Testament, shaggy-haired prophet, a fatalist. Funny, too. He was severe, he was precise, he said what he had to say and he got out of there.\\"Barker, Derek (2009). Liner notes to Bruce Springsteen's Jukebox: The Songs that Inspired the Man [CD]. Chrome Dreams. =1997‚Äìpresent= Fogerty in concert, 2010 Fogerty returned to the commercial music industry in 1997 with Blue Moon Swamp. The layoff between Zombie and Swamp had been longer than his mid-1970s to mid-1980s break. The album was much more successful than Zombie and won the Grammy for best rock album in 1997. A live album, named Premonition, of the equally successful Blue Moon Swamp tour, was released to similar acclaim and good sales in 1998. A track from Blue Moon Swamp titled \\"Blue Moon Nights,\\" was used in the 2002 film The Rookie. On October 1, 1998, Fogerty was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 7000 Hollywood Blvd. In 2004, Fogerty released Deja Vu All Over Again through DreamWorks Records, which had taken over distribution of Fogerty's Warner catalog. Rolling Stone wrote: \\"The title track is Fogerty's indictment of the Iraq War as another Vietnam, a senseless squandering of American lives and power\\". On the album, Fogerty squeezed 10 songs into only 34 minutes. The sale of Fantasy Records to Concord Records in 2004 ended the 30-year estrangement between Fogerty and his former label, as the new owners took steps to restore royalty rights Fogerty had given up to be released from his contract with Fantasy in the mid-1970s. In September 2005, Fogerty returned to Fantasy Records, made possible when DreamWorks Records' noncountry-music unit was absorbed by Geffen Records, which dropped Fogerty, but continued to distribute his earlier solo albums. The first album released under the new Fantasy contract was The Long Road Home (November 2005), a compilation CD combining his CCR hits with solo material. A live CD and concert DVD were released the following year. Fogerty's touring schedule increased in the period after Deja Vu All Over Again. In October 2004, Fogerty appeared on the Vote for Change tour, playing seven of the concerts in U.S. swing states. He also appeared in a Christmas special video produced by the Australian children's group The Wiggles. Fogerty toured with John Mellencamp in the summer of 2005 and with Willie Nelson in the summer of 2006. On June 29, 2006, he played his first headlining British concert since 1972, at the Hammersmith Apollo theater in London, as part of the European leg of the tour. During that leg, he also performed in Sundsvall, Sweden, where 25,000 people came to see him perform at the town square. On Thanksgiving Day of 2006, Fogerty performed at halftime at the Miami Dolphins/Detroit Lions game and at the Denver Broncos/Kansas City Chiefs halftime later that evening.Thanksgiving game ‚Äì Volunteers needed!

On June 23, 2007, Fogerty appeared at Glastonbury Festival, playing an hour-long set of 17 songs, mainly CCR classics. Introducing \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\", Fogerty said he did not perform it at Woodstock as rumoured, but wrote the song inspired by the event. Revival was released October 2, 2007. Heavily promoted by the label, Revival debuted at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart with sales about 65,000 copies in its first week. Revival was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of 2008, but lost to the Foo Fighters. On February 10, 2008, Fogerty appeared with Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard on the Grammy Awards show. Along with these rock icons and his regular touring band, he played his 1973 single \\"Comin' Down The Road\\", leading into Lewis and Richard's performances of \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" and \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\", respectively. On March 16, 2008, Fogerty kicked off an Australian tour. On March 22 in Point Nepean, Australia, surprise guest Keith Urban joined Fogerty on stage, performing two songs: \\"Broken Down Cowboy\\", off Fogerty's newest album Revival, and \\"Cotton Fields\\", from CCR's album Willy & the Poor Boys. On June 24, 2008, Fogerty made a return to the Royal Albert Hall, a venue he last played with CCR in 1971. It was the last concert on his 2008 European tour. This concert was filmed (causing staging problems that annoyed some fans) and was released in 2009. On April 16, 2009, Fogerty performed his hit \\"Centerfield\\" from center field of the new Yankee Stadium, at its opening-day festivities. On July 2, 3, and 4, 2009, Fogerty performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl, which was sold out for these shows. Though billed as Fogerty with the LA Philharmonic, the orchestra began the night with music by US composers, and Fogerty and his band came on after intermission, playing only three songs with the orchestra. On August 31, 2009, Fogerty released The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again, a sequel 1973 solo debut The Blue Ridge Rangers.

The day commemorates Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, and celebrates the heritage and culture of the Irish in general. Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, c√©il√≠s, and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks. Christians who belong to liturgical denominations also attend church services and historically the Lenten restrictions on eating and drinking alcohol were lifted for the day, which has encouraged and propagated the holiday's tradition of alcohol consumption. Saint Patrick's Day is a public holiday in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador (for provincial government employees), and the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat. It is also widely celebrated in the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and New Zealand, especially amongst Irish diaspora. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated in more countries than any other national festival. Modern celebrations have been greatly influenced by those of the Irish diaspora, particularly those that developed in North America. However, there has been criticism of Saint Patrick's Day celebrations for having become too commercialised and for fostering negative stereotypes of the Irish people. Saint Patrick Saint Patrick was a 5th-century Romano-British Christian missionary and bishop in Ireland. Much of what is known about Saint Patrick comes from the Declaration, which was allegedly written by Patrick himself. It is believed that he was born in Roman Britain in the fourth century, into a wealthy Romano-British family. His father was a deacon and his grandfather was a priest in the Christian church. According to the Declaration, at the age of sixteen, he was kidnapped by Irish raiders and taken as a slave to Gaelic Ireland. It says that he spent six years there working as a shepherd and that during this time he \\"found God\\". The Declaration says that God told Patrick to flee to the coast, where a ship would be waiting to take him home. After making his way home, Patrick went on to become a priest. According to tradition, Patrick returned to Ireland to convert the pagan Irish to Christianity. The Declaration says that he spent many years evangelising in the northern half of Ireland and converted \\"thousands\\". Patrick's efforts against the druids were eventually turned into an allegory in which he drove \\"snakes\\" out of Ireland, despite the fact that snakes were not known to inhabit the region. Tradition holds that he died on 17 March and was buried at Downpatrick. Over the following centuries, many legends grew up around Patrick and he became Ireland's foremost saint. Celebration and traditions Traditional St Patrick's Day badges from the early 20th century, Museum of Country Life in County Mayo According to legend, Saint Patrick used the three- leaved shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity to Irish pagans. Today's Saint Patrick's Day celebrations have been greatly influenced by those that developed among the Irish diaspora, especially in North America. Until the late 20th century, Saint Patrick's Day was often a bigger celebration among the diaspora than it was in Ireland. Celebrations generally involve public parades and festivals, Irish traditional music sessions (c√©ilithe), and the wearing of green attire or shamrocks. There are also formal gatherings such as banquets and dances, although these were more common in the past. Saint Patrick's Day parades began in North America in the 18th century but did not spread to Ireland until the 20th century. The participants generally include marching bands, the military, fire brigades, cultural organisations, charitable organisations, voluntary associations, youth groups, fraternities, and so on. However, over time, many of the parades have become more akin to a carnival. More effort is made to use the Irish language, especially in Ireland, where the week of Saint Patrick's Day is \\"Irish language week\\".

Perhaps because of this, drinking alcohol ‚Äì particularly Irish whiskey, beer, or cider ‚Äì has become an integral part of the celebrations. The Saint Patrick's Day custom of \\"drowning the shamrock\\" or \\"wetting the shamrock\\" was historically popular, especially in Ireland. At the end of the celebrations, a shamrock is put into the bottom of a cup, which is then filled with whiskey, beer, or cider. It is then drunk as a toast to Saint Patrick, Ireland, or those present. The shamrock would either be swallowed with the drink or taken out and tossed over the shoulder for good luck.

Retrieved 12 March 2020 =Wearing green= Women wearing green in London On Saint Patrick's Day, it is customary to wear shamrocks, green clothing or green accessories. Saint Patrick is said to have used the shamrock, a three-leaved plant, to explain the Holy Trinity to the pagan Irish. This story first appears in writing in 1726, though it may be older. In pagan Ireland, three was a significant number and the Irish had many triple deities, a fact that may have aided St Patrick in his evangelisation efforts. Patricia Monaghan says there is no evidence that the shamrock was sacred to the pagan Irish. However, Jack Santino speculates that it may have represented the regenerative powers of nature, and was recast in a Christian contexticons of St Patrick often depict the saint \\"with a cross in one hand and a sprig of shamrocks in the other\\". Roger Homan writes, \\"We can perhaps see St Patrick drawing upon the visual concept of the triskele when he uses the shamrock to explain the Trinity\\". The first association of the colour green with Ireland is from the 11th century pseudo- historical book Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn (The Book of the Taking of Ireland), which forms part of the Mythological Cycle in Irish Mythology and describes the story of Go√≠del Glas who is credited as the eponymous ancestor of the Gaels and creator of the Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Manx). In the story Go√≠del Glas, who was the son of Scota and Niul, was bitten by a snake and was saved from death by Moses placing his staff on the snakebite. As a reminder of the incident he would retain a green mark that would stay with him and he would lead his people to a land that would be free of snakes. This is emphasized in his name Go√≠del which was anglicised to the word Gaelic and Glas which is the Irish word for green. Another story from the Lebor Gab√°la √ârenn written after the adventures of Go√≠del Glas refers to √çth climbing the tower (in reference to the Tower of Hercules) his father Breog√°n builds in Brigantia (modern day Corunna in Galicia, Spain) on a winters day and is so captivated by the sight of a beautiful green island in the distance that he must set sail immediately. This story also introduces three national personifications of Ireland, Banba, F√≥dla and √âriu. The colour green was further associated with Ireland from the 1640s, when the green harp flag was used by the Irish Catholic Confederation. Green ribbons and shamrocks have been worn on St Patrick's Day since at least the 1680s. The Friendly Brothers of St Patrick, an Irish fraternity founded in about 1750,Kelly, James.

Cork University Press, 1995. p.65 adopted green as its colour.The Fundamental Laws, Statutes and Constitutions of the Ancient Order of the Friendly Brothers of Saint Patrick. 1751. However, when the Order of St. Patrick‚Äîan Anglo-Irish chivalric order‚Äîwas founded in 1783 it adopted blue as its colour, which led to blue being associated with St Patrick. During the 1790s, green would become associated with Irish nationalism, due to its use by the United Irishmen. This was a republican organisation‚Äîled mostly by Protestants but with many Catholic members‚Äîwho launched a rebellion in 1798 against British rule. The phrase \\"wearing of the green\\" comes from a song of the same name, which laments United Irishmen supporters being persecuted for wearing green. The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries have seen the re-emergence of Irish cultural symbols, such as the Irish Language, Irish mythology, and the colour green, through the Gaelic Revival and the Irish Literary Revival which served to stir Irish nationalist sentiment. The influence of green was more prominently observable in the flags of the 1916 Easter Rising such as the Sunburst flag, the Starry Plough Banner, and the Proclamation Flag of the Irish Republic which was flown over the General Post Office, Dublin together with the Irish Tricolour. Throughout these centuries, the colour green and its association with St Patrick's Day grew. The wearing of the 'St Patrick's Day Cross' was also a popular custom in Ireland until the early 20th century. These were a Celtic Christian cross made of paper that was \\"covered with silk or ribbon of different colours, and a bunch or rosette of green silk in the centre\\". Celebrations by region=Ireland= A St Patrick's Day parade in Dublin General Post Office and the Spire on O'Connell Street on St. Patrick's Day Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland.Liam de Paor: St. Patrick's World, The Christian Culture of Ireland's Apostolic Age. Four Courts Press, Dublin, 1993 Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, which is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March.\\"Irish bishops move St. Patrick's Day 2008 over conflict with Holy Week\\", Catholic News St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160. However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day. In 1903, St Patrick's Day became an official public holiday in Ireland. This was thanks to the Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament introduced by Irish Member of Parliament James O'Mara. O'Mara later introduced the law which required that public houses be shut on 17 March after drinking got out of hand, a provision that was repealed in the 1970s. The first St Patrick's Day parade in Ireland was held in Waterford in 1903. The week of St Patrick's Day 1903 had been declared Irish Language Week by the Gaelic League and in Waterford they opted to have a procession on Sunday 15 March. The procession comprised the Mayor and members of Waterford Corporation, the Trades Hall, the various trade unions and bands who included the 'Barrack St Band' and the 'Thomas Francis Meagher Band'.Munster Express, 14 March 1903 The parade began at the premises of the Gaelic League in George's St and finished in the Peoples Park, where the public were addressed by the Mayor and other dignitaries.Munster Express, 21 March 1903, p.3Waterford Chronicle, 18 March 1903 On Tuesday 17 March, most Waterford businesses‚Äîincluding public houses‚Äîwere closed and marching bands paraded as they had two days previously.Waterford News, 20 March 1903 The Waterford Trades Hall had been emphatic that the National Holiday be observed. On St Patrick's Day 1916, the Irish Volunteers‚Äîan Irish nationalist paramilitary organisation‚Äîheld parades throughout Ireland. The authorities recorded 38 St Patrick's Day parades, involving 6,000 marchers, almost half of whom were said to be armed. The following month, the Irish Volunteers launched the Easter Rising against British rule. This marked the beginning of the Irish revolutionary period and led to the Irish War of Independence and Civil War. During this time, St Patrick's Day celebrations in Ireland were muted, although the day was sometimes chosen to hold large political rallies. The celebrations remained low-key after the creation of the Irish Free State; the only state-organized observance was a military procession and trooping of the colours, and an Irish-language mass attended by government ministers. In 1927, the Irish Free State government banned the selling of alcohol on St Patrick's Day, although it remained legal in Northern Ireland. The ban was not repealed until 1961. The first official, state-sponsored St Patrick's Day parade in Dublin took place in 1931.Armao, Frederic. \\"The Color Green in Ireland: Ecological Mythology and the Recycling of Identity\\".

A St Patrick's Day religious procession in Downpatrick, where Saint Patrick is said to be buried In Northern Ireland, the celebration of St Patrick's Day was affected by sectarian divisions. A majority of the population were Protestant Ulster unionists who saw themselves as British, while a substantial minority were Catholic Irish nationalists who saw themselves as Irish. Although it was a public holiday, Northern Ireland's unionist government did not officially observe St Patrick's Day. During the conflict known as the Troubles (late 1960s‚Äìlate 1990s), public St Patrick's Day celebrations were rare and tended to be associated with the Catholic community. In 1976, loyalists detonated a car bomb outside a pub crowded with Catholics celebrating St Patrick's Day in Dungannon; four civilians were killed and many injured. However, some Protestant unionists attempted to 're- claim' the festival, and in 1985 the Orange Order held its own St Patrick's Day parade. Since the end of the conflict in 1998 there have been cross- community St Patrick's Day parades in towns throughout Northern Ireland, which have attracted thousands of spectators. In the mid-1990s the government of the Republic of Ireland began a campaign to use St Patrick's Day to showcase Ireland and its culture. The government set up a group called St Patrick's Festival, with the aims: The first St Patrick's Festival was held on 17 March 1996. In 1997, it became a three-day event, and by 2000 it was a four-day event. By 2006, the festival was five days long; more than 675,000 people attended the 2009 parade. Overall 2009's five-day festival saw almost 1 million visitors, who took part in festivities that included concerts, outdoor theatre performances, and fireworks.

Since 1996, there has been a greater emphasis on celebrating and projecting a fluid and inclusive notion of \\"Irishness\\" rather than an identity based around traditional religious or ethnic allegiance. The week around St Patrick's Day usually involves Irish language speakers using more Irish during Seachtain na Gaeilge (\\"Irish Language Week\\").\\"Seachtain na Gaeilge\\", Dublin City Council Christian leaders in Ireland have expressed concern about the secularisation of St Patrick's Day. In The Word magazine's March 2007 issue, Fr Vincent Twomey wrote, \\"It is time to reclaim St Patrick's Day as a church festival\\". He questioned the need for \\"mindless alcohol-fuelled revelry\\" and concluded that \\"it is time to bring the piety and the fun together\\". As well as Dublin, many other cities, towns, and villages in Ireland hold their own parades and festivals, including Cork, Belfast, Derry, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, and Waterford. The biggest celebrations outside the cities are in Downpatrick, County Down, where Saint Patrick is said to be buried. The shortest St. Patrick's Day parade in the world formerly took place in Dripsey, County Cork. The parade lasted just 23.4 metres and traveled between the village's two pubs. The annual event began in 1999, but ceased after five years when one of the two pubs closed. =Elsewhere in Europe=England Saint Patrick's Day celebration at Trafalgar Square in London, 2006 In England, the British Royals traditionally present bowls of shamrock to members of the Irish Guards, a regiment in the British Army, following Queen Alexandra introducing the tradition in 1901.Proctor, Charlie (9 March 2018).

This event, which includes a parade, occurs each year during the weekend nearest St Patrick's Day. In Quebec City, there was a parade from 1837 to 1926. The Quebec City St-Patrick Parade returned in 2010 after more than 84 years. For the occasion, a portion of the New York Police Department Pipes and Drums were present as special guests. There has been a parade held in Toronto since at least 1863. There is a large parade in the city's downtown on the Sunday before 17 March. The Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team was known as the Toronto St. Patricks from 1919 to 1927, and wore green jerseys. In 1999, when the Maple Leafs played on St Patrick's Day, they wore green St Patrick's retro uniforms. Some groups, notably Guinness, have lobbied to make Saint Patrick's Day a national holiday. In March 2009, the Calgary Tower changed its top exterior lights to new green CFL bulbs just in time for St Patrick's Day. Part of an environmental non-profit organisation's campaign (Project Porchlight), the green represented environmental concerns. Approximately 210 lights were changed in time for Saint Patrick's Day, and resembled a Leprechaun's hat. After a week, white CFLs took their place. The change was estimated to save the Calgary Tower some $12,000 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 104 tonnes. Mexico The Saint Patrick's Battalion is honored in Mexico on Saint Patrick's Day. United States The Chicago River dyed green Saint Patrick's Day, while not a legal holiday in the United States, is nonetheless widely recognised and observed throughout the country as a celebration of Irish and Irish-American culture. Celebrations include prominent displays of the colour green, religious observances, numerous parades, and copious consumption of alcohol. The holiday has been celebrated in what is now the U.S since 1601.http://totallystaugustine.com/first-u-s-st-patricks-celebration- held-in-st-augustine-florida-in-1600/ In 2020, for the first time in over 250 years, the parade in New York City, the largest in the world, was postponed due to concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. \\"New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade, the largest such celebration in the world, was postponed late Wednesday over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus\\" =South America=Argentina Celebrations in Buenos Aires centre on Reconquista street. In Buenos Aires, a party is held in the downtown street of Reconquista, where there are several Irish pubs;. in 2006, there were 50,000 people in this street and the pubs nearby. Neither the Catholic Church nor the Irish community, the fifth largest in the world outside Ireland, take part in the organisation of the parties. Criticism Saint Patrick's Day celebrations have been criticised, particularly for their association with public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Some argue that the festivities have become too commercialised and tacky, and have strayed from their original purpose of honouring St Patrick and Irish heritage. Journalist Niall O'Dowd has criticised attempts to recast Saint Patrick's Day as a celebration of multiculturalism rather than a celebration of Irishness. Man in Leprechaun Outfit on St Patrick's Day Saint Patrick's Day celebrations have also been criticised for fostering demeaning stereotypes of Ireland and Irish people. An example is the wearing of 'leprechaun outfits', which are based on derogatory 19th century caricatures of the Irish. In the run up to St Patrick's Day 2014, the Ancient Order of Hibernians successfully campaigned to stop major American retailers from selling novelty merchandise that promoted negative Irish stereotypes. Some have described Saint Patrick's Day celebrations outside Ireland as displays of \\"Plastic Paddyness\\"; where foreigners appropriate and misrepresent Irish culture, claim Irish identity, and enact Irish stereotypes. LGBT groups in the US were banned from marching in Saint Patrick's Day parades in New York City and Boston, resulting in the landmark Supreme Court decision of Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston. In New York City, the ban was lifted in 2014, but LGBT groups still find that barriers to participation exist. In Boston, the ban on LGBT group participation was lifted in 2015.

Mellencamp (born October 7, 1951), previously known as Johnny Cougar, John Cougar, and John Cougar Mellencamp, is an American musician, singer- songwriter, painter, actor, and film director. He is known for his catchy, populist brand of heartland rock, which emphasizes traditional instrumentation. Mellencamp rose to fame in the 1980s while \\"honing an almost startlingly plainspoken writing style\\" that, starting in 1982, yielded a string of Top 10 singles, including \\"Hurts So Good\\", \\"Jack & Diane\\", \\"Crumblin' Down\\", \\"Pink Houses\\", \\"Lonely Ol' Night\\", \\"Small Town\\", \\"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.\\", \\"Paper in Fire\\", and \\"Cherry Bomb\\". He has amassed 22 Top 40 hits in the United States. In addition, he holds the record for the most tracks by a solo artist to hit number one on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, with seven. Mellencamp has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning one. His latest album of original songs, Sad Clowns & Hillbillies, was released on April 28, 2017. Mellencamp is also one of the founding members of Farm Aid, an organization that began in 1985 with a concert in Champaign, Illinois, to raise awareness about the loss of family farms and to raise funds to keep farm families on their land. Farm Aid concerts have remained an annual event over the past 35 years, and the organization has raised over $57 million to promote a strong and resilient family farm system of agriculture. Mellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 10, 2008. On June 14, 2018, Mellencamp was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. His biggest musical influences are Bob Dylan, Woody Guthrie, James Brown, and the Rolling Stones. Rolling Stone contributor Anthony DeCurtis said: \\"Mellencamp has created an important body of work that has earned him both critical regard and an enormous audience. His songs document the joys and struggles of ordinary people seeking to make their way, and he has consistently brought the fresh air of common experience to the typically glamour-addled world of popular music.\\" In 2001, Billboard magazine editor-in- chief Timothy White said: Former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty said of Mellencamp: Johnny Cash called Mellencamp \\"one of the 10 best songwriters\\" in music. Early life Mellencamp was born in Seymour, Indiana and is of German ancestry. He was born with spina bifida, for which he had corrective surgery as an infant. Mellencamp formed his first band, Crepe Soul, at the age of 14 and later played in the local bands Trash, Snakepit Banana Barn and the Mason Brothers. When Mellencamp was 18, he married his pregnant girlfriend Priscilla Esterline. Mellencamp became a father in December 1970, only six months after he graduated from high school. His daughter, Michelle, later became a mother at age 18, making Mellencamp a grandfather at 37. Mellencamp attended Vincennes University, a two-year college in Vincennes, Indiana, starting in 1972. During this time he abused drugs and alcohol, stating in a 1986 Rolling Stone interview, \\"When I was high on pot, it affected me so drastically that when I was in college there were times when I wouldn't get off the couch. I would lie there, listening to Roxy Music, right next to the record player so I wouldn't have to get up to flip the record over. I'd listen to this record, that record. There would be four or five days like that when I would be completely gone.\\" During his college years, Mellencamp played in several local bands, including the glitter-band Trash, which was named for a New York Dolls song, and he later got a job in Seymour installing telephones. During this period, Mellencamp, who had given up drugs and alcohol before graduating from college, decided to pursue a career in music and traveled to New York City in an attempt to land a record contract. Music career=1976‚Äì1982: Performing as Johnny Cougar and John Cougar= After about 18 months of traveling between Indiana and New York City in 1974 and 1975, Mellencamp finally found someone receptive to his music and image in Tony DeFries of MainMan Management. DeFries insisted that Mellencamp's first album, Chestnut Street Incident, a collection of covers and a handful of original songs, be released under the stage name Johnny Cougar, insisting that the bumpy German name \\"Mellencamp\\" was too hard to market. Mellencamp reluctantly agreed, but the album was a commercial failure, selling only 12,000 copies. Mellencamp confessed in a 2005 interview: \\"That [name] was put on me by some manager. I went to New York and everybody said, 'You sound like a hillbilly.' And I said, 'Well, I am.' So that's where he came up with that name. I was totally unaware of it until it showed up on the album jacket. When I objected to it, he said, 'Well, either you're going to go for it, or we're not going to put the record out.' So that was what I had to do... but I thought the name was pretty silly.\\" Mellencamp recorded The Kid Inside, the follow-up to Chestnut Street Incident, in 1977, but DeFries eventually decided against releasing the album and Mellencamp was dropped from MCA records (DeFries finally released The Kid Inside in early 1983, after Mellencamp achieved stardom). Mellencamp drew interest from Rod Stewart's manager, Billy Gaff, after parting ways with DeFries and was signed onto the small Riva Records label. At Gaff's request, Mellencamp moved to London, England, for nearly a year to record, promote and tour behind 1978's A Biography. The record wasn't released in the United States, but it yielded a top-five hit in Australia with \\"I Need a Lover\\". Riva Records added \\"I Need a Lover\\" to Mellencamp's next album released in the United States, 1979's John Cougar, where the song became a No. 28 single in late 1979. Pat Benatar recorded \\"I Need a Lover\\" on her debut album In the Heat of the Night. In 1980, Mellencamp returned with the Steve Cropper-produced Nothin' Matters and What If It Did, which yielded two Top 40 singles ‚Äì \\"This Time\\" (No. 27) and \\"Ain't Even Done With the Night\\" (No. 17). \\"The singles were stupid little pop songs,\\" he told Record Magazine in 1983. \\"I take no credit for that record. It wasn't like the title was made up ‚Äì it wasn't supposed to be punky or cocky like some people thought. Toward the end, I didn't even go to the studio. Me and the guys in the band thought we were finished, anyway. It was the most expensive record I ever made. It cost $280,000, do you believe that? The worst thing was that I could have gone on making records like that for hundreds of years. Hell, as long as you sell a few records and the record company isn't putting a lot of money into promotion, you're making money for 'em and that's all they care about. PolyGram loved Nothin' Matters. They thought I was going to turn into the next Neil Diamond.\\" In 1982, Mellencamp released his breakthrough album, American Fool, which contained the singles \\"Hurts So Good\\", an uptempo rock tune that spent four weeks at No. 2 and 16 weeks in the top 10, and \\"Jack & Diane\\", which was a No. 1 hit for four weeks. A third single, \\"Hand To Hold On To\\", made it to No. 19. \\"Hurts So Good\\" went on to win the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance at the 25th Grammys. \\"To be real honest, there's three good songs on that record, and the rest is just sort of filler,\\" Mellencamp told Creem Magazine of American Fool in 1984. \\"It was too labored over, too thought about, and it wasn't organic enough. The record company thought it would bomb, but I think the reason it took off was ‚Äì not that the songs were better than my others ‚Äì but people liked the sound of it, the 'bam- bam-bam' drums. It was a different sound.\\" =1983‚Äì1990: Performing as John Cougar Mellencamp= With some commercial success under his belt, Mellencamp had enough clout to force the record company to add his real surname, Mellencamp, to his stage moniker. The first album recorded under his new name John Cougar Mellencamp was 1983's Uh-Huh, a Top-10 album that spawned the Top 10 singles \\"Pink Houses\\" and \\"Crumblin' Down\\" as well as the No. 15 hit \\"Authority Song\\", which he said is \\"our version of \\"I Fought the Law'.\\" During the recording of Uh-Huh, Mellencamp's backing band settled on the lineup it retained for the next several albums: Kenny Aronoff on drums and percussion, Larry Crane and Mike Wanchic on guitars, Toby Myers on bass and John Cascella on keyboards. In 1988, Rolling Stone magazine called this version of Mellencamp's band \\"one of the most powerful and versatile live bands ever assembled.\\" On the 1984 Uh-Huh Tour, Mellencamp opened his shows with cover versions of songs he admired growing up, including Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", the Animals' \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\", Lee Dorsey's \\"Ya Ya\\" and the Left Banke's \\"Pretty Ballerina\\". Since college, Mellencamp, with the exception of his continuing addiction to nicotine, has lived a drug and alcohol-free lifestyle. In 1984, when asked about his views on drugs, he told Bill Holdship of Creem magazine, \\"If you want to stick needles in your arms, go ahead and fucking do it. You're the one that's going to pay the consequences. I don't think it's a good idea, and I sure don't advocate it, but I'm not going to judge people. Hell, if that was the case, you wouldn't like anyone in the music business because everyone's blowing cocaine.\\" In 1985, Mellencamp released Scarecrow, which peaked at No. 2 in the fall of 1985 and spawned five Top 40 singles: \\"Lonely Ol' Night\\" and \\"Small Town\\" (both No. 6), \\"R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A. (A Salute to '60s Rock)\\" (No. 2), \\"Rain on the Scarecrow\\" (No. 21) and \\"Rumbleseat\\" (No. 28). According to the February 1986 edition of Creem Magazine, Mellencamp wanted to incorporate the sound of classic '60s rock into Scarecrow, and he gave his band close to a hundred old singles to learn \\"almost mathematically verbatim\\" prior to recording the album. \\"Learning those songs did a lot of positive things,\\" Mellencamp explained to Creem writer Bill Holdship. \\"We realized more than ever what a big melting pot of all different types of music the '60s were. Take an old Rascals song for example ‚Äì there's everything from marching band beats to soul music to country sounds in one song. Learning those opened the band's vision to try new things on my songs. It wasn't let's go back and try to make this part fit into my song, but I wanted to capture the same feeling ‚Äì the way those songs used to make you feel. After a while, we didn't even have to talk about it anymore. If you listen to the lead Larry [Crane] plays on 'Face of the Nation,' he never would have played that 'cause he didn't really know who the Animals were. He's young, and he grew up listening to Grand Funk Railroad. You hear it, and it's like 'where did that come from?' It had to be from hearing those old records.\\" Scarecrow was the first album Mellencamp recorded at his own recording studio, jokingly dubbed \\"Belmont Mall\\", located in Belmont, Indiana and built in 1984. Mellencamp sees Scarecrow as the start of the alternative country genre: \\"I think I invented that whole 'No Depression' thing with the Scarecrow album, though I don't get the credit,\\" he told Classic Rock magazine in October 2008.UK's Classic Rock Magazine In-depth Mellencamp Interview Classic Rock Magazine December 2008. In the liner notes to Mellencamp‚Äôs 2010 box set On the Rural Route 7609, Anthony DeCurtis wrote of Mellencamp‚Äôs influence on the No Depression movement: Shortly after finishing Scarecrow, Mellencamp helped organize the first Farm Aid benefit concert with Willie Nelson and Neil Young in Champaign, Illinois on September 22, 1985. The Farm Aid concerts remain an annual event and have raised over $57 million for struggling family farmers . Prior to the 1985‚Äì86 Scarecrow Tour, during which he covered some of the same 1960s rock and soul songs he and his band rehearsed prior to the recording of Scarecrow, Mellencamp added fiddle player Lisa Germano to his band. Germano would remain in Mellencamp's band until 1994, when she left to pursue a solo career. Mellencamp's next studio album, 1987's The Lonesome Jubilee, included the singles \\"Paper in Fire\\" (No. 9), \\"Cherry Bomb\\" (No. 8), \\"Check It Out\\" (No. 14), and \\"Rooty Toot Toot\\" (No. 61) along with the popular album tracks \\"Hard Times for an Honest Man\\" and \\"The Real Life\\", both of which cracked the top 10 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart. \\"We were on the road for a long time after Scarecrow, so we were together a lot as a band,\\" Mellencamp said in a 1987 Creem Magazine feature. \\"For the first time ever, we talked about the record before we started. We had a very distinct vision of what should be happening here. At one point, The Lonesome Jubilee was supposed to be a double album, but at least 10 of the songs I'd written just didn't stick together with the idea and the sound we had in mind. So I just put those songs on a shelf, and cut it back down to a single record. Now, in the past, it was always 'Let's make it up as we go along' ‚Äì and we did make some of The Lonesome Jubilee up as we went along. But we had a very clear idea of what we wanted it to sound like, even before it was written, right through to the day it was mastered.\\" As Frank DiGiacomo of Vanity Fair wrote in 2007, \\"The Lonesome Jubilee was the album in which Mellencamp defined his now signature sound: a rousing, crystalline mix of acoustic and electric guitars, Appalachian fiddle, and gospel-style backing vocals, anchored by a crisp, bare-knuckle drumbeat and completed by his own velveteen rasp.\\" During the 1987‚Äì88 Lonesome Jubilee Tour, Mellencamp was joined onstage by surprise guest Bruce Springsteen at the end of his May 26, 1988 gig in Irvine, California, for a duet of Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", which Mellencamp performed as the penultimate song during each show on that tour. After the Lonesome Jubilee Tour, Mellencamp divorced his second wife, Vicki. In 1989, Mellencamp released the personal album Big Daddy, with the key tracks \\"Jackie Brown\\", \\"Big Daddy of Them All\\", and \\"Void in My Heart\\" accompanying the Top 15 single \\"Pop Singer\\". The album, which Mellencamp called at the time the most \\"earthy\\" record he'd ever made, is also the last to feature the \\"Cougar\\" moniker. In 1991, Mellencamp said: \\"'Big Daddy' was the best record I ever made. Out of my agony came a couple of really beautiful songs. You can't be 22 years old and had two dates and understand that album.\\" Mellencamp was heavily involved in painting at this time in his life and decided not to tour behind Big Daddy, stating: \\"What's the point?... This other step that people keep wanting me to take to become another level of recording artist ‚Äì to be Madonna? To sell out? To bend over? To kiss somebody's ass? I ain't gonna do it.\\" In his second painting exhibition, at the Churchman-Fehsenfeld Gallery in Indianapolis in 1990, Mellencamp's portraits were described as always having sad facial expressions and conveying \\"the same disillusionment found in his musical anthems about the nation's heartland and farm crisis.\\"Painting Provides a Respite The Argus- Press May 4, 1990. =1991‚Äì1997: Performing as John Mellencamp= Mellencamp's 1991 album, Whenever We Wanted, was the first with a cover billed to John Mellencamp; the \\"Cougar\\" was finally dropped for good. Whenever We Wanted yielded the Top 40 hits \\"Get a Leg Up\\" and \\"Again Tonight\\", but \\"Last Chance\\", \\"Love and Happiness\\" and \\"Now More Than Ever\\" all garnered significant airplay on rock radio. \\"It's very rock 'n' roll\\", Mellencamp said of Whenever We Wanted: \\"I just wanted to get back to the basics.\\" In 1993, he released Human Wheels, and the title track peaked at No. 48 on the Billboard singles chart. \\"To me, this record is very urban,\\" Mellencamp told Billboard magazine of Human Wheels in the summer of 1993. \\"We had a lot of discussions about the rhythm and blues music of the day. We explored what a lot of these (current) bands are doing ‚Äì these young black bands that are doing more than just sampling.\\" Mellencamp's 1994 Dance Naked album included a cover of Van Morrison's \\"Wild Night\\" as a duet with Meshell Ndegeocello. \\"Wild Night\\" became Mellencamp's biggest hit in years, peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also contained two protest songs in \\"L.U.V.\\" and \\"Another Sunny Day 12/25\\", in addition to the title track, which hit No. 41 on the Hot 100 in the summer of 1994. \\"This is as naked a rock record as you're going to hear,\\" Mellencamp said of Dance Naked in a 1994 Billboard magazine interview. \\"All the vocals are first or second takes, and half the songs don't even have bass parts. Others have just one guitar, bass, and drums, which I haven't done since American Fool.\\" With guitarist Andy York now on board as Larry Crane's full-time replacement, Mellencamp launched his Dance Naked Tour in the summer of 1994, but suffered a minor heart attack after a show at Jones Beach in New York on August 8 of that year that eventually forced him to cancel the last few weeks of the tour. \\"I was up to 80 cigarettes a day,\\" Mellencamp told the Boston Herald in September 1996 about the habits that led to his heart malfunction two years prior. \\"We'd finish a show and I'd go out and have steak and french fries and eggs at 4 in the morning and then go to sleep with all that in my gut. It was just a terrible lifestyle.\\" He returned to the concert stage in early 1995 by playing a series of dates in small Midwestern clubs under the pseudonym Pearl Doggy. In September 1996, the experimental album Mr. Happy Go Lucky, which was produced by Junior Vasquez, was released to critical acclaim. \\"It's been fascinating to me how urban records use rhythm and electronics, and it's terribly challenging to make that work in the context of a rock band\\", Mellencamp told Billboard magazine in 1996. \\"But we took it further than an urban record. The arrangements are more ambitious, with programs and loops going right along with real drums and guitars.\\" Mr. Happy Go Lucky spawned the No. 14 single \\"Key West Intermezzo (I Saw You First)\\" (Mellencamp's last Top 40 hit) and \\"Just Another Day\\", which peaked at No. 46. =1998‚Äì2003: Recording for Columbia= After the release of Mr. Happy Go Lucky and a subsequent four-month tour from March‚ÄìJuly 1997 to promote it, Mellencamp signed a four-album deal with Columbia Records, although he wound up making only three albums for the label. Issued a day before his 47th birthday in 1998, his self-titled debut for Columbia Records included the singles \\"Your Life Is Now\\" and \\"I'm Not Running Anymore\\", along with standout album tracks such as \\"Eden Is Burning\\", \\"Miss Missy\\", \\"It All Comes True\\" and \\"Chance Meeting at the Tarantula\\". The switch in labels coincided with Dane Clark replacing Aronoff on drums. \\"On this record, we ended up quite a bit away from where we started\\", Mellencamp told Guitar World Acoustic in 1998. \\"Initially, I wanted to make a record that barely had drums on it. Donovan made a record (in 1966), Sunshine Superman, and I wanted to start with that same kind of vibe‚ÄîEastern, very grand stories, fairy tales.\\" He released a book of his early paintings, titled Paintings and Reflections, in 1998. In 1999, Mellencamp covered his own songs as well as those by Bob Dylan and the Drifters for his album Rough Harvest (recorded in 1997), one of two albums he owed Mercury Records to fulfill his contract (the other was The Best That I Could Do, a best-of collection). In May 2000, he gave the Indiana University commencement address, in which he advised graduates to \\"play it like you feel it!\\" and that \\"you'll be all right\\". Following the delivery of his address, Indiana University bestowed upon him an honorary Doctorate of Musical Arts. In August 2000, Mellencamp played a series of unannounced free concerts in major cities on the East Coast and in the Midwest as a way of giving back to fans who had supported him the previous 24 years. With a lo-fi setup that included portable amps and a battery-powered P.A. system, Mellencamp, armed with an acoustic guitar and accompanied only by an accordionist and a violist, dubbed the jaunt \\"Live in the Streets: The Good Samaritan Tour\\". At these dozen shows, which ranged in length from 45 to 60 minutes, Mellencamp covered a number of rock and folk classics and sprinkled in a few of his own songs. \\"Nobody's selling anything, there's no souvenirs‚Äîexcept what's in everybody's heart\\", Mellencamp told Billboard magazine. \\"Think about it: Isn't that where music started? To anybody who's said thank you to me, I say, 'You're very nice, but, really, thank you.'\\" The early 21st century also found Mellencamp teaming up with artists such as Chuck D and India.Arie to deliver his second Columbia album, Cuttin' Heads and the single \\"Peaceful World\\". Cuttin' Heads also included a duet with Trisha Yearwood on a love song called \\"Deep Blue Heart\\". \\"He played me this song\\", Yearwood told Country.com, \\"and he said, 'I kind of have an idea of like when Emmylou Harris sang on Bob Dylan's record, just kind of harmony all the way through.'\\" Mellencamp embarked on the Cuttin' Heads Tour in the summer of 2001, before the album was even released. He opened each show on this tour with a cover of the Rolling Stones' \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and also played a solo acoustic version of the Cuttin' Heads track \\"Women Seem\\" at each show. In 2003, he released Trouble No More, a quickly recorded collection of folk and blues covers originally done by artists such as Robert Johnson, Son House, Lucinda Williams and Hoagy Carmichael. The album was also dedicated to Mellencamp's friend, Billboard magazine editor-in-chief Timothy White, who died from a heart attack in 2002. Mellencamp sang the gospel song \\"Will The Circle Be Unbroken\\" at White's funeral on July 2, 2002. In October 2002, Mellencamp performed the Robert Johnson song \\"Stones in My Passway\\" at two benefit concerts for White. Columbia Records executives, who were in attendance at the benefit shows, were so impressed with Mellencamp's live renditions of \\"Stones in My Passway\\" that they convinced him to record an album of vintage American songs, which ultimately became Trouble No More. Trouble No More spent several weeks at No. 1 on Billboards Blues Album charts. =2004‚Äì2007: Words and Music and Freedom's Road= Mellencamp participated in the Vote for Change tour in October 2004 leading up to the 2004 U.S. Presidential election. That same month he released the two-disc career hits retrospective Words & Music: John Mellencamp's Greatest Hits, which contained 35 of his radio singles (including all 22 of his Top 40 hits) along with two new tunes, \\"Walk Tall\\" and \\"Thank You\\" ‚Äì both produced by Babyface but written by Mellencamp. In 2005, Mellencamp toured with Donovan and John Fogerty. The first leg of what was called the Words and Music Tour in the spring of 2005 featured Donovan playing in the middle of Mellencamp's set. Mellencamp would play a handful of songs before introducing Donovan and then duetting with him on the 1966 hit \\"Sunshine Superman\\". Mellencamp would leave the stage as Donovan played seven or eight of his songs (backed by Mellencamp's band) and then return to finish off his own set after Donovan departed. On the second leg of the tour in the summer of 2005, Fogerty co-headlined with Mellencamp at outdoor amphitheaters across the United States. Fogerty would join Mellencamp for duets on Fogerty's Creedence Clearwater Revival hit \\"Green River\\" and Mellencamp's \\"Rain on the Scarecrow\\". Mellencamp (right) and his band perform at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2007. Mellencamp released Freedom's Road, his first album of original material in over five years, on January 23, 2007. He intended for Freedom's Road to have a 1960s rock sound while still remaining contemporary, and he feels that goal was achieved. \\"We wanted to make sure that it had the same feeling of some of the great songs from the '60s but also had the message of today and had the backbeat of today. I think we came up with a pretty timeless sounding album\\", Mellencamp told his online radio station in late 2006. \\"Our Country\\", the first single from Freedom's Road, was played as the opening song on Mellencamp's 2006 spring tour, and the band that opened for him on that tour, Little Big Town, was called on to record harmonies on the studio version of \\"Our Country\\", as well as seven other songs on Freedom's Road. Although Mellencamp had always been outspoken and adamant about not selling any of his songs to corporations to use in commercials, he changed his stance and let Chevrolet use \\"Our Country\\" in Chevy Silverado TV commercials that began airing in late September 2006. \\"I agonized\\", Mellencamp told USA Todays Edna Gundersen in 2007 over his decision to license \\"Our Country\\" to Chevrolet. \\"I still don't think we should have to do it, but record companies can't spend money to promote records anymore, unless you're U2 or Madonna. I'm taking heat because no one's ever done this before. People have licensed songs that have already been hits, but nobody's licensed a brand-new song to a major company, and people don't know how to react.\\" Mellencamp sang \\"Our Country\\" to open Game 2 of the 2006 World Series, and the song was nominated for a 2008 Grammy Award in the Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance category, but lost to Bruce Springsteen's \\"Radio Nowhere\\". Freedom's Road peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart by selling 56,000 copies in its first week on the market. =2008‚Äì2013: The T Bone Burnett Era= On August 13, 2007, Mellencamp began recording his 18th album of original material, titled Life, Death, Love and Freedom. The album, which was released on July 15, 2008, was produced by T Bone Burnett. The first song with video, \\"Jena\\", was introduced on Mellencamp's website in October 2007. In an interview with the Bloomington Herald-Times in March 2008, Mellencamp dubbed Life, Death, Love and Freedom \\"The best record I've ever made.\\" He signed with Starbucks' Hear Music label to distribute the album and said, \\"they think it's a fucking masterpiece\\". The album's first single was \\"My Sweet Love\\". A video for the song was filmed in Savannah, Georgia on June 9, 2008. Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town is featured in the video. She harmonizes with Mellencamp on \\"My Sweet Love\\" and provides background vocals to three other songs on Life, Death, Love and Freedom, which became the ninth Top 10 album of Mellencamp's career when it debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 the week of August 2, 2008. Like Freedom's Road, Life, Death, Love and Freedom also sold 56,000 copies in its first week. In its list of the 50 best albums of 2008, Rolling Stone magazine named Life, Death, Love and Freedom No. 5 overall and also dubbed \\"Troubled Land\\" No. 48 among the 100 best singles of the year. John Mellencamp and Sheryl Crow perform Mellencamp's 2008 single \\"My Sweet Love\\" in the Hunter Region, New South Wales, Australia on November 29, 2008. Mellencamp made a guest appearance at Billy Joel's concert on July 16, 2008 at Shea Stadium in New York, singing \\"Pink Houses.\\" On September 3, 2008, Mellencamp made available on his website a home-video recording of his solo acoustic cover of Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" as a sign that the 2008 Presidential Election was going to bring about change in America. On September 23, 2008, Mellencamp filmed a concert at the Crump Theatre in Columbus, Indiana for a new A&E; Biography series called Homeward Bound. The show featured performers returning to small venues where they performed during the early stages of their careers. Mellencamp had last played at the Crump Theatre on October 4, 1976. The program aired on December 11, 2008 and also featured an in-depth documentary tracing Mellencamp's roots. For the first time since the Whenever We Wanted Tour in 1992, Mellencamp toured Australia and New Zealand with opening act Sheryl Crow from November 15 ‚Äì December 7, 2008. Crow joined Mellencamp on stage to duet on \\"My Sweet Love\\" during the last seven shows. Mellencamp participated in a tribute concert for Pete Seeger's 90th birthday on May 3, 2009 at Madison Square Garden in New York City which raised funds for an environmental organization founded by Seeger to preserve and protect the Hudson River. Mellencamp performed solo acoustic renditions of Seeger and Lee Hays' \\"If I Had a Hammer\\" and his own \\"A Ride Back Home.\\" In the summer of 2009, Mellencamp embarked on a tour of minor league ballparks with Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson that ran from July 2 ‚Äì August 15. While he was on tour, Mellencamp recorded a new album titled No Better Than This that was again produced by T Bone Burnett. The tracks for the album were recorded at historic locations, such as the First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia as well as at the Sun Studio in Memphis and the Sheraton Gunter Hotel in San Antonio where blues pioneer Robert Johnson recorded \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" and \\"Crossroad Blues\\". Mellencamp recorded the album using a 1955 Ampex portable recording machine and only one microphone, requiring all the musicians to gather together around the mic. The album was recorded in mono. Mellencamp wrote over 30 songs for the record (only 13 made the final cut), and he wrote one song specifically for Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel Mellencamp told the San Antonio Express-News: No Better Than This was released on August 17, 2010 and peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard 200, becoming the 10th Top 10 album of his career. No Better Than This is the first mono-only release to make the top 10 since James Brown's Pure Dynamite! Live at the Royal, which peaked at No. 10 in April 1964. On December 6, 2009, Mellencamp performed \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" as a tribute to Bruce Springsteen, who was one of the honorees at the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors. \\"I was very proud and humbled to have been able to play 'Born in the U.S.A.' in a different fashion that I think was true to the feelings that Bruce had when he wrote it\\", Mellencamp said. He performed \\"Down by the River\\" on January 29, 2010 in Los Angeles in tribute to Neil Young, who was honored at the 20th annual MusiCares Person of the Year gala. Mellencamp sang the hymn \\"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize\\" at \\"In Performance at the White House: A Celebration of Music from the Civil Rights Movement\\" on February 9, 2010. A career-spanning box set of album tracks and demos titled On the Rural Route 7609 was released on June 15, 2010, nine weeks before No Better Than This hit stores. \\"If you didn't get deeper into the original albums and know these songs, it will be like discovering new material\\", Mellencamp said about On the Rural Route 7609. Mellencamp, who co-headlined 11 shows in the summer of 2010 with Bob Dylan, launched the No Better Than This theater tour on October 29, 2010 in his hometown of Bloomington, Indiana. On this tour, which ran through the summer of 2012 and covered the entire United States and Canada and much of Europe, Mellencamp opened each concert with a showing of a Kurt Markus documentary about the making of No Better Than This called \\"It's About You\\" before hitting the stage to play three different sets: a stripped-down acoustic set with his band, a solo acoustic set, and a fully electrified rock set. \\"It'll be like Alan Freed, like the old Moondog shows\\", Mellencamp told Billboard magazine prior to the tour: Mellencamp played for over two hours and included 24 songs in his setlist on the tour. He brought the No Better Than This tour to Europe in the summer of 2011, opening in Copenhagen on June 24. One reviewer called the opening gig of the European leg of the tour \\"maybe the best rock- performance ever in Denmark.\\" The No Better Than This Tour returned to the U.S. for one final round of shows from October 25 ‚Äì November 19, 2011. The tour finally concluded with a tour of Canada in the summer of 2012. Mellencamp took part in two Woody Guthrie tribute concerts in 2012 as part of a year-long celebration surrounding the 100-year anniversary of the folk icon's birth. On July 8, 2014, Mellencamp released a new live album called Performs Trouble No More Live at Town Hall without any advance notice. The album captures his live performance at Town Hall in New York City on July 31, 2003, in which he performed every track from his 2003 Trouble No More covers album in addition to a rendition of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" by Bob Dylan and reworked versions of three of his own songs. Two songs performed at the 2003 Town Hall concert, the 1962 Skeeter Davis hit \\"The End of the World\\" and the traditional folk song \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", did not make the final track list despite the album's official press release stating that the CD and digital versions \\"feature the complete 15-song concert.\\" =2014‚Äì2018: Plain Spoken, Sad Clowns & Hillbillies and Other People's Stuff= In October 2013, Mellencamp revealed that he was working on a new album, and he offered this update on the project to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: \\"I've had a couple rehearsals with the band, and T Bone [Burnett] and I go in the studio in January. I'm not part of the music business. I want to write my songs, do some little shows.\\" A short time later, Mellencamp told Rolling Stone: \\"I've got a notebook with 85 new songs that I've written for my next record. T Bone Burnett is going to come out to Indiana sometime in early January and we're gonna go into the studio for however long it takes to make a new album. I haven't done one in five years.\\" In January 2014, Mellencamp began recording the project, which would ultimately be titled Plain Spoken and would become his 20th album of original material and 22nd studio album overall. The album was released on September 23, 2014. Although Mellencamp said that Burnett would serve as the producer of Plain Spoken, Burnett was only credited as the \\"executive producer\\" of the album. In the summer of 2014, Mellencamp conducted a brief 10-show tour. During these concerts, which primarily took place at casinos and festivals across the United States and Canada, he gave the first taste of Plain Spoken by playing \\"Troubled Man\\", the album's first track and first single. \\"Troubled Man\\" was released to iTunes on August 19, 2014 and was sent to radio stations for airplay on September 8. Mellencamp promoted Plain Spoken with a 120-show North American tour that began on January 21, 2015 in South Bend, Indiana and concluded, with its seventh and final leg, on November 4, 2016 in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Outside of the Plain Spoken Tour, Mellencamp's most noteworthy live performance in 2015 came on February 6, when he paid tribute to Bob Dylan at the annual MusiCares Person of the Year event by performing piano-and-vocal rendition of \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" (the piano was played by Troye Kinnett from Mellencamp's band). USA Today wrote: \\"The musical high point in a night of many highlights was probably John Mellencamp's interpretation of 'Highway 61 Revisited;' with a vocal tone and timbre that channeled Tom Waits', he made this usually scorching rocker into a blues dirge. Never has Mellencamp sounded so artful.\\" After a star-studded lineup paid tribute to Dylan with cover versions of some of his greatest songs, Dylan closed the evening with a 30-minute speech that included a reference to Mellencamp's 2008 song \\"Longest Days\\". Dylan said: \\"And like my friend John Mellencamp would singbecause John sang some truth today'one day you get sick and you don't get better.' That's from a song of his called 'Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days.' It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying.\\" Mellencamp said Dylan's endorsement was worth more than 10 Grammys. In December 2015, Mellencamp began recording a duets album with Carlene Carter, who was his opening act for all shows on the Plain Spoken Tour and would join Mellencamp for two songs during his set. \\"We really enjoyed singing together on tour,\\" Carter told The Advocate: \\"Our voices clicked really good. John got the idea to do an album together. I was blown away. I think we're onto something really interesting, but I won't give the surprise away.\\" Carter gave additional information to the Austin Chronicle: \\"We're actually making a duet record together starting in December, so I'm writing for that. It's different, because I've never really sat down and tried to write duets. That's going to be a fun challenge. Mellencamp and Carter's duets album, titled Sad Clowns & Hillbillies, was released on April 28, 2017. \\"We wrote a couple of songs together, and she wrote some and I wrote some,\\" Mellencamp told USA Today of the material on Sad Clowns & Hillbillies. Mellencamp and Carter debuted two songs from the album, \\"Indigo Sunset\\" and \\"My Soul's Got Wings\\", during Mellencamp's concert in Tulsa on April 1, 2016 (Carter served as the opening act for the show). \\"Indigo Sunset\\" was written by both Mellencamp and Carter, while Mellencamp wrote the music to \\"My Soul's Got Wings\\", giving life to a previously unheard lyric written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie. While it is considered a duets project, Carter gave Pacific University the first piece of insight that the album wouldn't consist strictly of duets. \\"Sad Clowns & Hillbillies is a wonderful conglomeration of [John's] songs and my songs. Some are duets and some are by themselvesit's different, but really kind of the way John and I roll. We are very like-minded and on musical ground that really feels right. It's been quite a wonderful ride.\\" Carter was featured on only five of Sad Clowns & Hillbillies 13 tracks and contributed to the writing of just two songs. Mellencamp released Easy Targetthe first single from Sad Clowns & Hillbillies and a \\"reflection on the state of our country\\" on January 19, 2017, which was the eve of the 2017 Presidential Inauguration. When debuting \\"Easy Target\\" on January 19, Mellencamp told Katie Couric: \\"I didn't even want to write the song. I know this sounds crazy, but it happens a lot, I think, to songwritersyou can't tell it by looking, but I was working outand all of a sudden I just started singing 'easy targets' and I thought, 'oh no, now I've got to stop what I'm doing\\" and it took me... you know, somebody just sent it to me and I just wrote it down. The melody came [intact], the lyrics... as fast as I could write is how long it took me to write the whole song.\\" Later in his interview with Couric, Mellencamp delivered further insights into Sad Clowns & Hillbillies: \\"It's crazy the way it startedit was going to be a religious record. It started out like 'Look, lets go back and do an old country religious record. We'll try to write songs that sound like those songs, but they'll be new.' And then it just kept evolving and evolving and evolving, and the songs that she was bringing and the songs that I was bringingthey weren't so religious. I write a lot of sad songs, so it's like Sad Clowns & Hillbilliesthat's where it came from.\\" The album's second single, \\"Grandview\\", was released on February 24, 2017. Mellencamp launched his Sad Clowns & Hillbillies Tour on June 5, 2017 in Denver, Colorado. The 2017 leg of the tour concluded on September 3 in Canfield, Ohio. Carter, Emmylou Harris, Jewel, and Lily & Madeleine served as supporting acts. Mellencamp concluded the Sad Clowns & Hillbillies Tour with a run of Canadian shows that began September 26, 2018 in Moncton, New Brunswick and wrapped up on November 14 in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Carter did not accompany Mellencamp on the Canadian portion of the tour. Instead, a 30-minute documentary film was shown before Mellencamp hit the stage each night. In addition to his work on Sad Clowns & Hillbillies, Mellencamp wrote the title song to the 2017 American war movie The Yellow Birds, which was released on June 15, 2018 by Saban Films. On February 1, 2018, Netflix began streaming a concert that took place on October 25, 2016 at the Chicago Theatre as part of Mellencamp's Plain Spoken Tour. The 80-minute film is more of a documentary than a true concert film, as Mellencamp narrates the entire presentation with stories about his childhood, his early days in music, his relationship with his family, the music business and many more topics. A CD/DVD/Blu-Ray release of the documentary and of the concert without Mellencamp's narration, titled Plain Spoken: From the Chicago Theatre, was released on May 11, 2018. Mellencamp released a compilation album of cover songs titled Other People's Stuff on December 7, 2018.John Mellencamp Debuts at No. 1 on Top Rock Albums With 'Other People's Stuff Billboard, December 19, 2018. Retrieved December 20, 2018 He began a 39-date theater tour in February 2019, dubbed \\"The John Mellencamp Show\\", that concluded April 30, 2019 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. =2019‚Äìpresent: Jack & Diane musical and new album= In two separate 2018 television interviews, Mellencamp teased a new musical he is working on based on his 1982 No. 1 hit \\"Jack & Diane\\". On June 12, 2019, Republic Records, Federal Films and Universal Music Theatricals announced that the musical is officially in development. Mellencamp (music/lyrics) will team with Naomi Wallace (book) to form the creative team behind the still-untitled musical, with Kathleen Marshall, winner of three Tonys out of nine nominations, signed on to direct and choreograph. \\"This is a story about those people who live, love and die on the underside of the American Dream in small towns all across our country,\\" the backers of the musical said in the official announcement. \\"This is a tale, laced with humor and visceral energy, about star-crossed lovers, and their stubborn refusal to give up, to lie down, to let go of the potential their youthful dreams once promised. This is also a story about a town in free-fall, and the tough choices people make, not always in their best interests.\\" On February 27, 2020, Mellencamp's official social media accounts confirmed that he‚Äôs currently recording a new album at his Belmont Mall recording studio. In a September 2020 interview, Mellencamp guitarist Andy York said that 10 songs have already been recorded and mixed for the new album, but a planned final session in April 2020 to complete the project was scuttled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Mellencamp has written at least 15 new songs, and it appears some of them will find their way onto the new record. The album was scheduled for release in 2020, but the pandemic has pushed its release time frame back indefinitely. Personal life Mellencamp lives five miles outside of Bloomington, Indiana, on the shores of Lake Monroe, but he also has a vacation home on Daufuskie Island, South Carolina. In January 2018, Mellencamp purchased an loft in the Soho district of New York City for $2.3 million that he is using as an art studio. Mellencamp was married to Priscilla Esterline from 1970 until 1981 and to Victoria Granucci from 1981 until 1989. He married fashion model Elaine Irwin on September 5, 1992. On December 30, 2010, Mellencamp announced that he and Irwin had separated after 18 years of marriage. Their divorce became official on August 12, 2011, with the couple negotiating \\"an amicable settlement of all issues involving property and maintenance rights, the custody and support of their children, and all other issues\\", according to the settlement agreement. Mellencamp has five children from his three marriages: daughter Michelle from his marriage to Esterline; daughters Teddi Jo and Justice from his marriage to Granucci; and sons Hud and Speck from his marriage to Irwin. Daughter Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave was a cast member The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills for three seasons. After his divorce from Irwin, Mellencamp began dating actress Meg Ryan. It was reported that Mellencamp and Ryan broke up in the middle of 2014 after dating for over three years. In September 2015, Mellencamp reportedly started dating former supermodel Christie Brinkley. In August 2016, the couple's publicist confirmed they had broken up. In July 2017, it was reported that Mellencamp and Ryan had reunited and were dating again. In November 2018, the couple became engaged. On October 30, 2019, it was reported the actress had ended their engagement. In April 2020, it was reported that Mellencamp has been dating skincare expert Jamie Sherrill since the beginning of the year. Politics and activism Mellencamp was critical of Ronald Reagan through his music in the 1980s and wrote some scathing lyrics about Reagan in his 1989 song \\"Country Gentleman:\\" \\"He ain't a-gonna help no children/He aint a-gonna help no women/He just gonna help his rich friends.\\" In 2003, Mellencamp became one of the first entertainers to speak out against the Iraq War when he released the song \\"To Washington\\", which was also critical of the 2000 U.S. Presidential elections. \\"When the song first came out I was in the car one day and we were driving to the airport and I had my kids with me and a radio station was playing 'To Washington' and having callers call in\\", Mellencamp said. \\"Some guy comes on and says, 'I don't know who I hate the most, John Mellencamp or Osama bin Laden.'\\" In an \\"Open Letter to America\\" on his website, Mellencamp stated: On his 2007 album, Freedom's Road, Mellencamp included a hidden track called \\"Rodeo Clown\\", which was a direct reference to George W. Bush (\\"The bloody red eyes of the rodeo clown\\"). In April 2007, Mellencamp performed for wounded troops at the Walter Reed Medical Center. His original intent was to duet on the Freedom's Road track, \\"Jim Crow\\", with singer and activist Joan Baez. However, Army officials barred Baez from performing. He told Rolling Stone magazine: According to a February 8, 2008, Associated Press report, Mellencamp's camp asked that the campaign for presidential candidate Sen. John McCain stop using his songs, including \\"Our Country\\" and \\"Pink Houses\\", during their campaign events. McCain's campaign responded by pulling the songs from their playlist. Mellencamp's publicist, Bob Merlis, noted to the Associated Press: Merlis also noted that the same songs had been used, with Mellencamp's approval, by John Edwards's campaign; in response, the McCain campaign ceased using the songs. Mellencamp performed \\"Small Town\\" at a Barack Obama rally in Evansville, Indiana on April 22, the night of the 2008 Pennsylvania primary. Mellencamp also performed \\"Our Country\\" at a rally for Hillary Clinton in Indianapolis, Indiana, on May 3, 2008, although he never came out in support of either Obama or Clinton during the primaries. \\"Neither candidate is as liberal as he would prefer, but he's happy to contribute what he can\\", Merlis said. On January 18, 2009, Mellencamp performed \\"Pink Houses\\" at the Obama inaugural celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. In 2010, Mellencamp's music was used by the National Organization for Marriage at events opposing same-sex marriage. In response, Mellencamp instructed Merlis to pen a letter to NOM stating \\"that Mr. Mellencamp's views on same sex marriage and equal rights for people of all sexual orientations are at odds with NOM's stated agenda\\" and requesting that NOM \\"find music from a source more in harmony with your views than Mr. Mellencamp in the future.\\" Mellencamp supported Michael Bloomberg in his 2020 presidential campaign by taping a Bloomberg 2020 campaign ad that featured Mellencamp singing Small Town. Musical style Mellencamp's musical style has generally been described as rock, heartland rock, roots rock and folk rock. AllMusic describes Mellencamp's sound as a \\"heartland blend of Stonesy hard rock and folk.\\" Visual art Noted art writer Hilarie M. Sheets, a contributing editor to ARTnews who writes regularly for The New York Times, called Mellencamp \\"a natural storyteller\\" in a 2012 essay she wrote about his artwork. Known over the course of his successful four-decade music career for his acutely observed songs about the American landscape and its cast of characters, Mellencamp has been equally productive as a painter mining similar terrain. Mellencamp's interest in painting began in early life, but was superseded in the 1980s by his skyrocketing musical career. However, throughout his life, Mellencamp has continued to seriously explore painting. Mellencamp's late mother, Marilyn, loved to paint landscapes and flowers and her son fell in love with both art and music at an early age. \\"I started messing around with oil paints when I was about ten but, you know, without instruction,\\" he remembers. Mellencamp came to New York in the mid-1970s with the intention of studying painting if his music-career aspirations didn't pan out. In 1988, he joined the Art Students League and had his first formal training with portrait painter David Leffel, who taught him the technique of painting dark to light in the manner of Rembrandt and other old masters. His discovery of early 20th-century modernists including Chaim Soutine, Walt Kuhn, and particularly the German Expressionists Otto Dix and Max Beckmann pointed the way toward a visceral, pared down approach to portraiture. He later studied with Jan Royce from the Herron School of Art and Design in Indianapolis. His portraiture evolved to a personal style that some critics describe as similar to the dark and shadowy paintings of the German Expressionists. They involve expressiveness by means of exaggeration and distortion of line and color, in favor of a simplified style intended to carry an emotional impact. According to Mellencamp, \\"German painting remains the basic foundation for what I do same as folk music is the foundation of my songs. Discovering Beckmann to me was like discovering Woody Guthrie or Bob Dylan.\\" Mellencamp's paintings from the 1990s‚Äîof family and friends and many of himself‚Äîshow lone figures isolated frontally against simple, shadowy backgrounds. They stare at the viewer or off into space with eyes both tough and vulnerable, projecting intensity akin to Beckmann's self-portraits with his sad, glowering eyes. Art writer Doug McClemont, in a review for Art Space, stated: \\"Mellencamp paints handsomely grotesque portraits in oil that are as solemn and stirring as his hit songs are catchy and inspirational. They depict existential scenes and human beings ridden with the angst of the everyday. There are no smiles on the faces of Mellencamp's painted figures. His sad clowns, ex-girlfriends, creative heroes, imagined outliers, and hillbilly singers are often endowed with oversize hands and facial features and always with deadpan, proud stares.\\" \\"I see sadness in the world,\\" Mellencamp says. Mellencamp's art work has been the focus of a number of exhibitions. He had his first major museum exhibition, Nothing Like I Planned, at Tennessee State Museum in Nashville, Tennessee from April 12 through June 10, 2012. \\"He is a great American musician from an agricultural heartland, which is close to our own agrarian roots,\\" said Lois Riggins-Ezzell, the Tennessee State Museum's executive director. \\"In his painting, he speaks to the voice of the heartland which is about doing the right thing and about equality and humanity and about the dignity of the farmer and the laborer.\\" An exhibition called The Paintings of John Mellencamp came to the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio from November 3, 2013 to January 12, 2014 and was Mellencamp's first major exhibition in an art museum. According to Dr. Louis A. Zona, director and curator of the Butler Institute: \\"I was interested in the dialogue between Mellencamp's work and the Butler's more traditional collection of 19th- and 20th- century American art by masters including John Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer, and Raphael Soyer. John's work is beautifully executed with incredibly fascinating studies.\\" A full-color 48-page catalogue with the aforementioned essay by Sheets accompanied the exhibition. Writes Sheets, \\"While Mellencamp has never been interested in whether he captures a faithful likeness of his subjects; he is after a kind of emotional realism and does follow certain \\"rules\\" of painting. For Mellencamp, painting has always been a refuge, a solitary antidote to the hectic life of touring and performing. He doesn't see it as a precious or rarified activity but rather about staying productive, keeping his mind engaged, making something out of nothing.\\" \\"Every day that I walk up in my art studio and I complete a painting, I have something to show for my time\\", says Mellencamp, who sees himself painting through old age. \\"I have millions of them in me.\\" Mellencamp has also honed his skills by his own self-education in art history, visiting museums across Europe and America whenever he was on tour and studying a broad spectrum of artists and the mechanics of their work and by looking at signs and billboards out the windows of cars and buses while crisscrossing the country. According to Sheets, \\"In recent years, Mellencamp has incorporated the looser, more jangly rhythms of street art into panoramic canvases that reflect his social and political activism also present in his music.\\" \\"The songwriting and the painting are very closely knitted together,\\" says Mellencamp, who often will pick up his guitar or start a canvas without premeditation and see what suggests itself to him. \\"Everything is a possible song. Everything is a possible painting.\\" Nationally known art writer Lilly Wei, who interviewed Mellencamp for Studio International, also wrote a brief essay, in which she points out, \\"Mellencamp is a writer and often uses words in his paintings, from the graffiti scribbled across earlier work inspired by what he saw in the streets and Jean-Michel Basquiat to his present versions of text painting, a genre that is increasingly commonplace in works by artists such as Lawrence Weiner, Richard Prince, Glenn Ligon and Christopher Wool. Mellencamp, who works in a very different, very personal idiom, makes plainspoken paintings, he says, because he's a plainspoken man. If these works are any indication, plain painting can be extraordinarily eloquent.\\" An exhibit of Mellencamp's paintings, titled \\"American Dreams: Paintings by John Mellencamp\\", was on view at the Morris Museum of Art in Augusta, Georgia from January 11 to April 12, 2015. The exhibit included 50 oil and mixed-media paintings, including several never- before seen by the public. The most recent showing of Mellencamp's artwork, titled \\"John Mellencamp: The Isolation of Mister\\", ran from October 22 until December 19, 2015 at the ACA Galleries in New York City. Mellencamp's latest painting exhibition, titled Life, Death, Love, and Freedom (named in honor of his critically acclaimed 2008 album's 10th anniversary), ran at the ACA Galleries from April 26 through June 2, 2018. In addition to the exhibitions listed above, Mellencamp was part of a group show at the Gerald Peters Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico. His work has also been exhibited at Herron School of Art and Design, a division of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. In 1989, he was part of a two-man show with jazz legend Miles Davis at The Triangle Gallery in Los Angeles. Harper Collins published Paintings and Reflections, an overview of Mellencamp's earlier work as a painter, in 1998. Collaboration with George Green Mellencamp co-wrote several of his best-known songs with his childhood friend George Green who, like Mellencamp, was born and raised in Seymour, Indiana. Green contributed lyrics to numerous Mellencamp radio hits and classic album tracks, including \\"Human Wheels\\", \\"Minutes to Memories\\", \\"Hurts So Good\\", \\"Crumblin' Down\\", \\"Rain on the Scarecrow\\", \\"Your Life is Now\\", and \\"Key West Intermezzo\\", in addition to songs recorded by Barbra Streisand, Hall & Oates, Jude Cole, Ricky Skaggs, Sue Medley, The Oak Ridge Boys, Percy Sledge, and Carla Olson. Mellencamp and Green's final collaboration was \\"Yours Forever\\", a song that was included on the soundtrack to the 2000 movie, The Perfect Storm. Mellencamp and Green had a falling out in the early 2000s, and Green ultimately moved from Bloomington, Indiana to Taos, New Mexico in 2001. \\"Like when you're married, when you're friends with somebody for a long time, the more things build up the more things can go wrong,\\" Mellencamp said in the liner notes to his 2010 box set, On the Rural Route 7609. \\"There were personal problems, cross-pollinated with professional issues. George has written some great lyrics and we've written some great songs together, but I just couldn't do it any more.\\" On August 28, 2011, Green died in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of 59 after losing a battle with a rapid-forming small cell lung cancer. \\"I've known George since we were in the same Sunday school class. We had a lot of fun together when we were kids. Later on, we wrote some really good songs together,\\" Mellencamp told the Bloomington Herald Times shortly after Green's death. \\"George was a dreamer, and I was sorry to hear of his passing.\\"Songwriter, Mellencamp collaborator George Green dies at 59. Bloomington Herald Times. Film career Mellencamp has made several forays into acting over the years, appearing in four films: Falling from Grace (which he also directed) (1992), Madison (2005, narration only), After Image (2001), and Lone Star State of Mind (2002). His older brother, Joe Mellencamp, appears in Falling from Grace as the bandleader during the country club scene along with his band Pure Jam. In 1980, Mellencamp turned down the lead role in the movie The Idolmaker because, as he told the Toledo Blade in 1983, \\"I was afraid that if I made too much money, I'd have no motivation to make records anymore.\\" Mellencamp told VH1 that he was originally offered the Brad Pitt role in Thelma and Louise: \\"You know they used to want me to be an actor all the time and I used to get more movie role offers. That's when I was ‚Äì believe it or not, I used to not be as ugly as I am now. And they gave me this script called Thelma & Louise and they said, 'The guy wrote the part with you in mind, John, you really gotta do this part.' And I read the script and I thought, 'Yeah, I get it but I don't want to take my shirt off.' So Brad Pitt took his shirt off and look what happened to Brad Pitt. I was that close.\\" Mellencamp could've been a movie star . VH1. In April 2007, Mellencamp was a \\"guest critic\\" on At the Movies, filling in for Roger Ebert. Ghost Brothers of Darkland County Mellencamp began working on a musical with horror author Stephen King, entitled Ghost Brothers of Darkland County, in 2000. The musical debuted in the spring of 2012 at Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia, where it ran from April 4 through May 13. A CD/DVD deluxe edition, featuring the dialog, soundtrack, handwritten lyrics and a mini-documentary about the making of the musical, was released on June 4, 2013. Production on the musical's recorded soundtrack began on June 15, 2009, when T Bone Burnett, who served as the project's musical producer, began laying down tracks in Los Angeles for the songs Mellencamp wrote for the project. The soundtrack includes Rosanne Cash, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello, Taj Mahal, Ryan Bingham, Will Dailey and Neko Case among others singing the songs Mellencamp wrote. In November 2010, Mellencamp told the Chicago Tribune: Ryan D'Agostino of Esquire stated in a review of a New York rehearsal of Ghost Brothers of Darkland County in the fall of 2007, \\"Musicals aren't usually a guy thing. This one, though, is not only tolerable, it's good. It may be the first-ever musical written by men for men. There's no orchestra, just two twangy acoustic guitars, an accordion, and a fiddle. The songs are both haunting and all-American.\\" The Alliance Theatre described the show as a \\"Southern Gothic musical fraught with mystery, tragedy and ghosts of the past.\\" The official description of Ghost Brothers of Darkland County from the Alliance Theatre website: Ghost Brothers of Darkland County received mixed reviews upon its initial run in Atlanta. The musical toured 20 U.S. cities as a \\"radio play\\" in the fall of 2013 and toured 18 more cities across the U.S. in the fall of 2014. In 2015, the show was further developed in London, although King and Mellencamp are no longer as actively involved: \\"Steve and I are taking a step back ... but if they called and said they needed a song, I would write one,\\" Mellencamp told USA Today. In October 2018, it was announced that Broadway Licensing have redeveloped Ghost Brothers of Darkland County and made it available for worldwide licensing beginning in 2019. Ithaca Mellencamp wrote the score for the Meg Ryan movie Ithaca, which premiered on October 23, 2015 at the Middleburg Film Festival in Virginia and was released in theaters and on-demand by Momentum Pictures on September 9, 2016. \\"Not one note [in Ithaca] is anything other than Mellencamp. He did everything,\\" said Ryan, Mellencamp's on-again, off-again girlfriend. In a May 6, 2016 Q&A; after a screening of the movie at Geena Davis' Bentonville Film Festival, Ryan said: \\"The music is so beautiful. John Mellencamp wrote every note ‚Äì everything ‚Äì the tiny little needle drops you hear in the back. He wrote about half of it after I read him the script, and then the next half after he saw the movie. He's just incredible.\\" In addition to the score, Mellencamp wrote two original songs for Ithaca: \\"Sugar Hill Mountain\\" (sung by Carlene Carter) and \\"Seeing You Around\\" (sung by Leon Redbone). \\"Sugar Hill Mountain\\" is a fiddle-driven folk song that describes an idyllic location where there's \\"bubble gum and cigarette trees\\", no clocks, every day is spring, and anything you need is \\"gratis.\\" (The song would later be included, in a re-recorded version, on Mellencamp's 2017 album Sad Clowns & Hillbillies.) Meanwhile, the piano-heavy \\"Seeing You Around\\" has the sound of a 1940s standard (the movie takes place during World War II) and is made all the more authentically '40s-sounding by Redbone's gruff, baritone vocals. Mellencamp's band provided the backing on both tracks and performed all the music that is in the movie. Said Carter in 2015: \\"The way John Mellencamp and I met was he invited me to come and sing this song he had written for the movie that Meg Ryan has coming out called Ithaca. That was when we became friends, when I went to Indiana and recorded with him and the guys this really cool song called 'Sugar Hill Mountain' that's in the movie. And the movie is wonderful. We got to see a rough cut of it and I was very impressed.\\" Influence on Keith Urban Country music star Keith Urban has consistently cited Mellencamp's influence on his music. It originated when Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee tour went to Australia in 1988 - Urban was in attendance at one of the concerts and described the experience as an \\"epiphany.\\" Urban told the Vancouver Sun in 2016: Urban went into more detail on the impact Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee Tour concert had on him when CMT asked him about the concert that most influenced him: Urban has covered numerous Mellencamp songs in his concerts over the years, including \\"Hurts So Good\\", \\"Jack and Diane\\", \\"Authority Song\\", and \\"Rumbleseat\\". In 2015, Urban and Mellencamp performed \\"Pink Houses\\" together twice during nationally televised events. Urban's 2015 hit single \\"John Cougar, John Deere, John 3:16\\" further illustrated Mellencamp's influence on his music. Honors and awards Mellencamp has won one Grammy Award (Best Male Rock Performer for \\"Hurts So Good\\" in 1983) and been nominated for 12 others. He has also been bestowed with the Nordoff-Robbins Silver Clef Special Music Industry Humanitarian Award (1991), the Billboard Century Award (2001), the Woody Guthrie Award (2003), and the ASCAP Foundation Champion Award (2007). On October 6, 2008, Mellencamp won the prestigious Classic Songwriter Award at the 2008 Q Awards in London, England. Mellencamp was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 14, 2018. On August 30, 2018, Mellencamp was bestowed with the Woody Guthrie Prize in Tulsa, Oklahoma. On September 9, 2010, Mellencamp received the Americana Lifetime Achievement Award in Nashville. On July 30, 2012 in San Jose, CA, Mellencamp was bestowed with the John Steinbeck Award, given to those individuals who exemplify the spirit of \\"Steinbeck's empathy, commitment to democratic values, and belief in the dignity of the common man.\\" On April 27, 2016, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) presented Mellencamp with its prestigious Founders Award at the 33rd annual ASCAP Pop Music Awards in Los Angeles. The ASCAP Founders Award goes to pioneering ASCAP songwriters who have made exceptional contributions to music by inspiring and influencing their fellow music creators. \\"For the last four decades, John Mellencamp has captured the American experience in his songs\\", said ASCAP President Paul Williams. \\"His infectious melodies and compassionate lyrics, wrapped in workingman's rock, crystallize life's joys and struggles and illuminate the human condition. A national treasure, he's also one of the truly great music creators that can make us care, move, clap and sing along.\\" In June 2019, WhyHunger bestowed Mellencamp with the ASCAP Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award, which shines a spotlight on artists who have proven their commitment to striving for social justice and creating real change in combating hunger worldwide. Mellencamp was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's Class of 2008. The induction ceremony took place in New York City on March 10, 2008, and Mellencamp was inducted by his good friend Billy Joel, who asked Mellencamp to induct him into the Rock Hall back in 1999 (Mellencamp had to opt out because of another commitment, so Ray Charles inducted Joel). During his induction speech for Mellencamp, Joel said: Band=Current members= * Mike Wanchic ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (1976‚Äìpresent) * Andy York ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (1994‚Äìpresent) * Miriam Sturm ‚Äì violin (1996‚Äìpresent) * Dane Clark ‚Äì drums, backing vocals (1996‚Äìpresent) * John Gunnell ‚Äì bass (1999‚Äìpresent) * Troye Kinnett ‚Äì keyboards, accordion, backing vocals (2006‚Äìpresent) =Former members= * Larry Crane ‚Äì guitars, backing vocals (1976‚Äì1991) * Robert \\"Ferd\\" Frank ‚Äì bass, backing vocals (1977‚Äì1981) * Tom Knowles ‚Äì drums, backing vocals (1977‚Äì1979) * Eric Rosser ‚Äì piano, keyboards (1979‚Äì1981) * Kenny Aronoff ‚Äì drums (1980‚Äì1996) * Kenneth Lax backing vocals (1979-1982) * Pat Peterson ‚Äì backing vocals (1981‚Äì2006) * Toby Myers ‚Äì bass, backing vocals (1982‚Äì1999) * Lisa Germano ‚Äì violin (1985‚Äì1994) * Crystal Taliefero ‚Äì backing vocals (1985‚Äì1989) * John Casella ‚Äì keyboards, accordion (1984‚Äì1992) * David Grissom ‚Äì guitars (1989, 1991‚Äì1993) * Michael Ramos ‚Äì keyboards, accordion (2002‚Äì2005) * Moe Z M.D. ‚Äì keyboards, organ, backing vocals (1996‚Äì2002) Discography Studio albums * Chestnut Street Incident (1976) * A Biography (1978) * John Cougar (1979) * Nothin' Matters and What If It Did (1980) * American Fool (1982) * The Kid Inside (1983) * Uh-Huh (1983) * Scarecrow (1985) * The Lonesome Jubilee (1987) * Big Daddy (1989) * Whenever We Wanted (1991) * Human Wheels (1993) * Dance Naked (1994) * Mr. Happy Go Lucky (1996) * John Mellencamp (1998) * Rough Harvest (1999) * Cuttin' Heads (2001) * Trouble No More (2003) * Freedom's Road (2007) * Life, Death, Love and Freedom (2008) * No Better Than This (2010) * Plain Spoken (2014) * Sad Clowns & Hillbillies (2017) See also * List of best-selling music artists * List of artists who reached number one on the U.S. Mainstream Rock chart * Bruce Robb ReferencesExternal links 2007 Vanity Fair feature Category:1951 births Category:American agnostics Category:American expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:American male singers Category:American people of German descent Category:American rock singers Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Indiana Democrats Category:Indiana University alumni Category:Living people Category:Mercury Records artists Category:People from Seymour, Indiana Category:People with spina bifida Category:Republic Records artists Category:Singers from Indiana Category:Songwriters from Indiana Category:Vincennes University alumni ","title":"John Mellencamp"},{"id":"170029","text":"A-ha (usually stylised as a-ha; ) is a Norwegian synth-pop band formed in Oslo in 1982. Founded by Paul Waaktaar-Savoy (guitars), Magne Furuholmen (keyboards, guitars), and Morten Harket (vocals), the band rose to fame during the mid-1980s. A-ha achieved their biggest success with their debut album Hunting High and Low in 1985. That album peaked at number one in their native country Norway, number 2 in the UK, and number 15 on the US Billboard album chart; yielded two international number-one singles: \\"Take On Me\\" and \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\\"; and earned the band a Grammy Award nomination as Best New Artist. In the UK, Hunting High and Low continued its chart success into the following year, becoming one of the best-selling albums of 1986. The band released studio albums in 1986, 1988, and 1990, with single hits including \\"Hunting High and Low\\", \\"The Living Daylights\\", \\"Stay on These Roads\\", and \\"Crying in the Rain\\". In 1994, after their fifth studio album, Memorial Beach (1993), failed to achieve the commercial success of their previous albums, the band went on hiatus. Following a performance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, A-ha recorded their sixth album, 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, which was another number-one album in Norway and Germany. This album was followed by Lifelines (2002); Analogue (2005), which was certified Silver in the UK; and Foot of the Mountain (2009), which was certified Silver in the UK and reached the Top Five 5 in many European countries. On 15 October 2009, the band announced they would split after the 2010 worldwide Ending on a High Note Tour. Thousands of fans from at least 40 different countries on six continents congregated to see A-ha for the last leg of the tour. On 4 December 2014, A-ha officially announced its participation at Rock in Rio 2015, which celebrated 30 years for both the band and the event. In 2015, it was announced that A-ha would re-unite and their tenth studio album, Cast in Steel, was released on 4 September 2015, and the band toured in support of the album. The band has released ten studio albums, several compilations and four live albums. In less than a year, during 2010, the band earned an estimated 500 million Norwegian kroner from concert tickets, merchandise and the release of a greatest hits album, making them one of the 40‚Äì50 highest-grossing bands in the world. The band were listed in the Guinness World Records book for having the biggest- paying rock concert attendance; they drew an audience of 198,000 at Maracan√£ Stadium during Rock in Rio festival. Their exact sale figures are somewhat controversial; according to their label, Rhino Entertainment, they have sold 55 million records, but other sources assert that they have sold more than 100 million units, albums and singles combined. Biography=Formation= The trio, composed of lead vocalist Morten Harket; guitarist P√•l Waaktaar-Savoy and keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, formed in 1982 and left Norway for London in order to make a career in music. \\"We were trying to think of what to call themselves, focusing on Norwegian words people could say in English.\\" They jettisoned that idea when Morten spotted a song called \\"A-ha\\" in Waaktaar's songbook. \\"It was a terrible song but a great name,\\" says Morten.Rolling Stone; circa 1986. \\"The Icemen Cometh\\" by David Fricke, page 18. They chose the studio of musician, producer, and soon-to-be-manager John Ratcliff because it had a Space Invaders machine. John Ratcliff introduced them to his manager, Terry Slater, and after a few meetings, A-ha enlisted Ratcliff as a manager as well. Slater and Ratcliff formed TJ Management. Ratcliff dealt with technical and musical aspects and Slater acted as the group's international business manager and as liaison to Warner Brothers' head office in Los Angeles. =Hunting High and Low (1984‚Äì1986)= An early version of \\"Take On Me\\" was the first song that Morten Harket had heard Magne Furuholmen and P√•l Waaktaar play in Asker. At that time, the song was called \\"Miss Eerie\\", and the two men were still known as Bridges. Morten stated it sounded more like a \\" Juicy fruit song \\" for a gum advert - It was renamed \\"Lesson One\\" when it was first recorded by A-ha. After some re-writing, multiple re-recordings, and three releases, \\"Take On Me\\" became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1985. The first version of the song, released in 1984, was promoted by a video of the band performing the song in front of a blue background. The song was then re- recorded with production by Alan Tarney, but this new release failed to chart. The song was re-released with a new, groundbreaking video; this time, the song peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 and at number two on the UK Singles Chart. A-ha became the first Norwegian band to have a number one hit in the U.S. The popularity of \\"Take on Me\\" earned the band a spot on the American television series Soul Train in 1985, making them one of the few white artists to appear on the black music-oriented show. (Gino Vanelli, Elton John, David Bowie, Hall & Oates, Sheena Easton, and Teena Marie all had performed on Soul Train prior to A-ha's 1985 performance.) The video used a pencil-sketch animation/live-action combination called rotoscoping, in which individual frames of live video are drawn over or coloured. It became one of the most instantly recognisable and most enduringly popular music videos in the US where it was nominated for eight awards at the third annual MTV Video Awards in 1986, winning six, including Best New Artist in a Video, Best Concept Video, Best Direction, Best Special Effects, and Viewer's Choice and Best Video of the Year. Their six MTV Award wins for that video gave them twice as many wins as Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" and more than any artist in the three years of the awards combined. The band's second single worldwide was \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\\", even though \\"Love Is Reason\\" was the second single in Norway. In the US, the song peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number 17 on Radio & Records airplay chart. A remix version was a club hit, rising to number 5 on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart. The music video for the song was another popular and critical success, nominated in three categories at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards and winning two, Best Cinematography and Best Editing, bringing A-ha's total to 11 nominations and eight wins. The following year, Peter Gabriel would earn 13 nominations and win nine awards, also for two separate videos. In successive years, even as the award categories expanded, only a few artists have approached‚Äîand none have surpassed the single-year award totals of A-ha and Gabriel. A-ha's American success culminated in their 1986 Grammy nomination in the Best New Artist category, which was eventually won by Sade. \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\" turned out to be A-ha's last Hot 100 top 40 single, and to this day in the United States, A-ha is remembered by the general public almost entirely because of their number one hit single, \\"Take On Me\\". As such, the band is frequently considered a one-hit wonder there, despite their two top 40 hits. In the UK, however, the story was very different: \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\" became their only number one there. In the UK, A-ha enjoyed continued success with two more hit singles from the same album‚Äî\\"Train of Thought\\" and \\"Hunting High and Low\\" (with another innovative video) ‚Äîand the band remained popular throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. The band's first album, 1985's Hunting High and Low, became a worldwide bestseller, spending most of October and November in the top 20 of Billboard's Top 200 album chart. The album and its four hit singles garnered international recognition for A-ha. Hunting High and Low earned triple platinum status in the UK and reached platinum status in the US and Germany, while earning gold in Brazil and the Netherlands. Hunting High and Low has sold 11 million copies worldwide. The album peaked at number 15 on the US on the Billboard 200 albums chart and at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart; it spent 38 weeks in the top 10 in Norway, including eight weeks at number one. =Golden age (1986‚Äì1994)= Magne Furuholmen in 2007 A-ha's second album, Scoundrel Days, was released in the midst of the 1986 world tour, and represented a move towards alternative rock, as synthpop began to fall out of style. Although the album received favourable reviews and had three singles become international hits, the album's sales (6.4 million copies) did not match those of its predecessor (except for Switzerland, where it is A-ha's best-selling album). \\"Cry Wolf\\" would be the last A-ha single to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. After the release of the album, A-ha toured in the US, its last appearance there for 20 years. The album has been certified platinum in the UK, Switzerland and Brazil, and has earned gold certification in Germany. Ned Raggett of AllMusic Guide would later write of the album, \\"The opening two songs alone make for one of the best one-two opening punches around: the tense edge of the title track, featuring one of Morten Harket's soaring vocals during the chorus and a crisp, pristine punch in the music, and 'The Swing of Things,' a moody, elegant number with a beautiful synth/guitar arrangement (plus some fine drumming courtesy of studio pro Michael Sturgis) and utterly lovelorn lyrical sentiments that balance on the edge of being overheated without quite going over...The '80s may be long gone, but Scoundrel Days makes clear that not everything was bad back then.\\" In May 1988, A-ha released their third studio album, titled Stay on These Roads, which matched the number-two chart peak of its two predecessors on the British album charts. Stay on These Roads has been certified Platinum in Brazil and France, and Gold in Switzerland, Germany, the UK, and the Netherlands. The album includes the title-track theme song to the James Bond film The Living Daylights. The version that appears on their album is a re-recording of the film version and single. The band has said that they are particularly proud of the title track, and all three members contributed to its writing. \\"Stay on These Roads\\" and \\"The Living Daylights\\" would remain part of their live set throughout the rest of the band's history. After the release of the album, the band went on a 74-city world tour. The album has sold more than 4.2 million copies worldwide. P√•l Waaktaar-Savoy live at Cologne, 29 October 2005 East of the Sun, West of the Moon featured a cover version of The Everly Brothers' 1963 single, \\"Crying in the Rain\\". In the late 1980s and early 1990s, A-ha were very popular in South America, especially in Brazil, where the band sold out some of the largest stadiums in the world. At the Rock in Rio II festival in January 1991, A-ha shocked the international entertainment press by drawing an audience of 198,000 at Maracan√£ stadium for their top-billed evening concert‚Äîa Guinness World Record for biggest rock concert attendance. In contrast, the other performers (George Michael, Prince, and Guns N' Roses) each drew less than a third of that audience, 60,000 each. In a 2009 interview from Cody Eide in Musicweek, celebrating A-ha's up and coming 25-year anniversary, the band members revealed that the record-breaking concert and the lack of media attention they received were a devastating blow to the band. The 1991 Rock in Rio festival, which should have been the band's crowning achievement, was instead a moment of crushing disappointment. \\"MTV interviewed everybody except us\\", remembers Waaktaar-Savoy. \\"They were all calling their bosses and saying, 'We must cover A-ha; it's the only night that has sold out.' But they weren't allowed to.\\" \\"I felt very alienated,\\" says Furuholmen. \\"It made us feel hopeless. We played to the biggest crowd in the world, and they ignored it.\\" East of the Sun, West of the Moon was certified Gold in Switzerland, Brazil, and Germany and Silver in the UK. Steven McDonald of AllMusic said of their fourth album, \\"This is a nicely crafted collection of songs, performed and sung beautifully, with lots of echoes and suggestions tucked into the music. While not an album one can discuss at length, it's an album that's a pleasure to listen to.\\" The album sold 3.2 million copies worldwide. Their last album before their hiatus was Memorial Beach, in 1993. Relative to previous releases, the album was a commercial disappointment. The only single from the album to chart officially outside of Norway was \\"Dark Is the Night\\", which peaked at number 19 in the United Kingdom. Memorial Beach is notably the last official American release by A-ha to date, although their material has continued to have limited availability there as imports. Despite the commercial reception, Q magazine listed the album as one of the 50 best albums of 1993. The following February, A-ha performed two concerts during the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, followed by tours of South Africa and Norway. A-ha were also chosen to compose the official song for the Winter Paralympic Games in Lillehammer, which they entitled \\"Shapes That Go Together\\". In 1994, the band unofficially entered a hiatus, and band members then focused on solo projects. =First comeback (1998‚Äì2007)= A-ha live at Cologne, 29 October 2005 The band was invited to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998. Paul wrote \\"Summer Moved On\\" especially for this performance.interview on \\"A-ha live at valhall homecoming\\" DVD, 2001 They also performed \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\". This performance was A-ha's comeback into the world of music, yet the band's set was controversially omitted from a programme of highlights of that concert that was televised in the UK, and even more controversially in the US by FOX. Nevertheless, the band returned to the studio. Those recording sessions resulted in 2000's Minor Earth Major Sky, an international tour, and a webcast performance of the band opening the new Vallhall Arena in Oslo on 24 and 25 March 2001. News item announcing the webcast. A-ha's video for \\"I Wish I Cared\\" was one of the first fully web- based animated flash music videos to be made available. (The first was Duran Duran's flash video for the 2000 song \\"Someone Else Not Me\\".) The album reached platinum status, with sales of 1.5 million copies, and spawned four singles: \\"Summer Moved On\\", \\"Minor Earth Major Sky\\", \\"Velvet\\" and \\"The Sun Never Shone That Day\\". \\"Summer Moved On\\" went to No. 1 in 17 countries. A-ha made a return appearance at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 2001, performing a new song, Differences, and Hunting High and Low. The subsequent album, Lifelines, was released in 2002, going platinum in Norway and producing two top 5 hits there, \\"Forever Not Yours\\" and \\"Lifelines\\". Jesper Hiro directed the video for \\"Lifelines\\", based on the short film A Year Along the Abandoned Road, which was directed by Morten Skallerud in 1991. The original short film was 12 minutes long; it shows a whole year passing by in one shot at 50,000 times the normal speed. A live album from their 2002 tour, titled How Can I Sleep with Your Voice in My Head, was released in March 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 hit \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV.\\" In 2004, a book entitled \\"The Swing of Things\\" was published, which also featured a CD of early demo material. That year A-ha celebrated their 20th anniversary with the release of a new singles collection, The Definitive Singles Collection 1984‚Äì2004. This compilation brought them back into the UK Top 20 Album Charts, where they reached number 13 and earned a Gold album. On 2 July 2005, A-ha performed at the Berlin edition of Live 8, in front of an audience of nearly 200,000 people. They began with \\"Hunting High and Low\\", followed by \\"Take On Me\\", during which Morten Harket had difficulties hearing himself when his in- ear monitor failed: he requested a two-minute break, which he used to comment on the cause of Live 8. The intended two minutes became almost seven, and the third song, \\"Summer Moved On,\\" became the last of their set. Although four songs had been rehearsed, the band's time had run out and the organisers told them to leave the stage. Lead vocalist Morten Harket live at Cologne, 29 October 2005 On 12 September 2005, A-ha played a quickly sold-out show at Irving Plaza in New York City, the band's first concert in North America since 1986 despite not having released any material there since 1993. On 27 August 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in Frogner Park in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway. On 4 November 2005, the band released its eighth studio album, Analogue. The UK release of the single \\"Analogue\\" gave A-ha their first top 10 hit in the UK since 1988. The album includes a guest appearance by Graham Nash of Crosby Stills & Nash performing backup vocals on the songs \\"Over the Treetops\\" and \\"Cosy Prisons\\". The song \\"Celice\\" became the band's ninth to go No. 1 on a major national chart, and its music video sparked criticism for its sexual content. The following tour included a gig at London's Shepherd's Bush in February 2006, along with a TV special in Africa. In 2006, A-ha recorded a cover of John Lennon's \\"No. 9 Dream\\" for Amnesty International. It was released in June 2007 on the album \\"Make Some Noise\\". On 30 October 2006 in London, A-ha received the prestigious Q Magazine Inspiration Award for their long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business. On 15 September 2007, A-ha played a free outdoor concert in Kiel, Germany. The band played on a floating stage in the harbour. This concert was streamed live on the internet via MSN. On 24 January 2009, 25 years after its first release, A-ha won the Norwegian Spellemann award for Hit of All Time for \\"Take On Me\\" on the 50th anniversary of the official hit list in Norway. =New direction and farewell (2008‚Äì2010)= On 20‚Äì22 May 2008, Morten Harket, Magne Furuholmen and P√•l Waaktaar-Savoy performed concerts in Oslo, Norway, to promote their respective solo material before coming together as A-ha to play \\"Train of Thought\\", \\"Take On Me\\", and two new songs, \\"Riding the Crest\\" and \\"Shadowside\\", which previewed the new A-ha album, Foot of the Mountain. These events led up to their performance at London's Royal Albert Hall on 24 May. On 24 April 2009, A-ha surprised their fan base by releasing their new single, \\"Foot of the Mountain\\", premiering that day on Norwegian radio. The single had been completed only the night before. The song is based upon the track \\"The Longest Night\\" by Magne Furuholmen, which was released on his album A Dot of Black in the Blue of Your Bliss. The single was released on 22 May in Germany. The band promoted the song by playing it during the final of Germany's Next Topmodel on 21 May in the Lanxess Arena, Cologne. Foot of the Mountain, A-ha's ninth studio album, was released in Europe on 19 June 2009. The album's material marked a return to synth pop, similar to the band's earliest work, although the first single (and title track) was not wholly indicative of this. The band collaborated with successful producer Steve Osborne, who has produced albums for such artists as Suede, New Order, Starsailor, Doves, Elbow, and U2. \\"What There Is\\", an earlier solo track by Magne Furuholmen, was re-recorded for the album. Foot of the Mountain entered the German album chart at number 1, the UK album chart at number 5 and debuted on European Album Sales Chart at number 8. In January 2010, Foot of the Mountain was certified platinum in Germany. \\"I feel more connected to Depeche Mode (compared with other acts of the '80s),\\" claimed Magne Furuholmen. A-ha performed a cover of \\"A Question of Lust\\" during a live performance for BBC Radio 2 ‚Äì The Dermot O'Leary Show on 25 July 2009. A-ha headlined the iTunes Live festival on 24 July 2009. The performance was recorded and made available for download on the iTunes site as with the previous festivals. In the Norwegian iTunes Store A-ha's release has yet to see the light of day. On 15 October 2009, the band announced they would split after a worldwide concert tour in 2010 ending in Oslo, Norway, at the Oslo Spektrum arena on 4 December 2010, News Item from Official Website. Retrieved 21 August 2014. with ticket sales starting the next day. The concert sold out the first day on sale. On 19 October 2009, a second farewell show was announced for 3 December 2010. To coincide with their split, the band released The Singles: 1984 ‚Äì 2004 in the US and re-released deluxe versions of their first two albums (Hunting High and Low and Scoundrel Days) as well as a third and final compilation album, a new live DVD and a re-release of the book The Swing of Things by Jan Omdahl. A new single titled \\"Butterfly, Butterfly\\" was revealed on 14 June 2010 and released as a single on 5 July to promote the new, double CD compilation, 25. It was announced that this was to be A-ha's last-ever recording. On 6 July 2010, the albums Hunting High and Low and Scoundrel Days were released as deluxe editions in the US through Rhino Records, featuring remixes, B-sides, demo versions, and extensive liner notes. Available in 2-disc CD and digital versions (with additional material), both albums debuted in the top 40 Billboard Top Internet Sales Chart, Hunting High and Low at number 34 and Scoundrel Days at number 36. Furuholmen revealed in an interview published in Magasinet, the magazine section of Norway's third largest newspaper, Dagbladet, that he suffers from atrial fibrillation. The news was picked up the same day by the electronic music magazine Side-Line. At the Spellemannprisen award show on 5 March 2011 in Oslo, Norway, various Norwegian artists from various music genres including Kaizers Orchestra, Ida Maria and Bertine Zetlitz performed a cover of one of A-ha's biggest hits, \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\", in honour of the band. After the performance, the band received the Spellemannprisen honorary award handed out by A-ha's Norwegian music colleagues with the words \\"Our Heroes ‚Äì Once upon a time, now ‚Äì still and forever\\". A-ha's final concerts in Oslo, Norway, were recorded by ten HD cameras with digital, surround-sound audio. Ending on a High Note Live, mixed by Toby Alington, is available in several formats, including the band's first Blu-ray release. A single-disc live album on CD culls sixteen tracks, while twenty tracks are featured on the Blu-ray, DVD, and deluxe edition double-CD set, which comes with a DVD. A bonus documentary appears in the deluxe set and Blu-ray versions. An NTSC version is released in the US and Japan. On 1 April 2011, A-ha released the DVD as well as the box-set containing both the DVD and the CD of their last concert, Ending on a High Note ‚Äì The Final Concert. The Blu-ray of the concert, however, was released on 11 April 2011. A-ha played at Oslo Spektrum on 21 August 2011, performing the song \\"Stay on These Roads\\" for a national memorial service dedicated to the victims of the 2011 Norway attacks. =Post-A-ha activities and anniversary releases (2011‚Äì2014)= After A-ha's break-up, Morten Harket released two studio albums, Out of My Hands (2012) and Brother (2014). P√•l Waaktaar-Savoy released two songs to the general public: with New Jersey-based vocalist Jimmy Gnecco he presented Weathervane as a new project in June 2011. Their self- titled single (Weathervane) was featured on the soundtrack for the movie Headhunters (based on the book Hodejegerne by Jo Nesb√∏). A second new song was \\"Manmade Lake\\" which was originally planned for A-ha's album Foot of the Mountain was released to Soundcloud in 2013. In 2012, Magne Furuholmen became a mentor on the show The Voice ‚Äì Norges beste stemme. His talent Martin Halla won the contest and had his first album produced by Furuholmen himself who is also an esteemed songwriter/producer for other artists. In 2014, Furuholmen agreed to compose the songs and supervise the recordings for the Norwegian film Beatles. =Second comeback (2015‚Äì2016)= In late 2014, rumours about new A-ha activities in 2015 embarked, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of \\"Take On Me\\". During an A-ha fan convention in Oslo in October 2014, manager Harald Wilk announced plans to re-release A-ha's first five albums on vinyl and albums 3 to 5 as deluxe editions. In December 2014, four years to the day of their final concert, the band announced that they had been invited to reunite to perform in Rock in Rio 2015. Later that year, on 21 March 2015, it was confirmed in national Norwegian newspapers that A-ha had reunited for a two-year period and writing new material. A-ha's tenth studio album, Cast in Steel, was released on 4 September 2015. On 26 October 2015 it was announced that A-ha would again be performing at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway. The album was promoted with a European tour from March through May 2016. In March 2016, they played a live concert which was broadcast on the BBC's Red Button service and on BBC Radio 2 as part of their \\"In Concert\\" strand. In Oslo Spektrum on 3 May 2016, A-ha cleared away their normal stage- production to give room for a very different concert performance in collaboration with Void, a Norwegian computational design studio working in the intersection between design, architecture, art and technology. The collaboration resulted in a unique one-of-a-kind concert with advanced scenography using 360 virtual reality technology. On 3 May 2016, A-ha gave a multimedia performance in collaboration with Void, a Norwegian computational design studio. The stereoscopic VR experience was made available for Android users directly through a YouTube app and also made available for iPhone users and other platforms. The concept involved several motion detectors that reacted to the band's movements, voices and instruments. 3D cameras, 20,000 lines of code, 1,000 square meters of projection film and massive projectors were set up as a visual show that turned the Spektrum arena in Oslo into a light installation and visual experience that unfolded live for the audience instead of a pre-programmed sequence. =MTV Unplugged tour (2017‚Äì18) and Hunting High and Low Tour (2019‚àí2020) = In December 2016, A-ha announced that they would go on a European acoustic tour in early 2018. They also stated that they were going to be producing an album and film from a series of acoustic performances, slated for June 2017, with the release scheduled for November 2017. In mid-June 2017, they recorded an MTV Unplugged special in the remote Norwegian island of Giske under close secrecy, with no phones or recording equipment being allowed into the studio. The CD, DVD, and Blu-ray recordings were released in October 2017. The European acoustic tour was also renamed from \\"An acoustic evening with A-ha\\" to the \\"MTV Unplugged tour 2018\\". In August 2017, the band confirmed the acoustic album would be titled Summer Solstice, and would feature two new A-ha songs, titled \\"This Is Our Home\\" and \\"A Break in the Clouds\\". The video for \\"This Is Our Home\\" was released in September 2017, followed by the Unplugged versions of \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\", \\"The Living Daylights\\" and \\"Take On Me\\", the latter of which received widespread acclaim for re-imagining the pop classic. The acoustic version of \\"Take On Me\\" was included in the movie Deadpool 2, released in May 2018. On 29 October 2019, A-ha started their \\"Hunting High and Low\\" tour in Dublin. They play, among other songs, their debut album in full length. The tour will stretch until the end of 2020 and includes next to many European countries also South Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and the United States. On the tour, they presented one new song called \\"Digital River\\". Legacy To date the band is the most successful global pop music act to have emerged from Norway. In its heyday in the mid-1980s the band achieved chart topping success in Britain and the United States, and it was subsequently commercially successful in non-English- speaking areas of the world such as Germany, France and in South American countries. In 1986, A-ha received eight MTV Video Music Awards during one award show. Their music video for the song \\"Take On Me\\" is considered to be one of the most distinctive music videos from the 1980s. On 17 February 2020 the music video reached 1 billion views on YouTube. At the time only four songs from the entire 20th century had reached that elusive mark ‚Äî \\"November Rain\\" and \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" by Guns N' Roses, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by Nirvana and Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" ‚Äî making \\"Take on Me\\" the fifth video from that time period to ever do so. Songs by A-ha, either in original form or in the form of cover versions have also been included as background music and performances in episodes of popular television series, such as Baywatch, Melrose Place, South Park, Smallville, Cougar Town, Private Practice, The Leftovers, and The Simpsons, as well as in promotions for shows like Dance Moms. A-ha's music has also been featured in movies such as One Night at McCool's, Grosse Pointe Blank and Corky Romano. They have written and performed a James Bond theme song‚Äî\\"The Living Daylights\\" for the film The Living Daylights. They have a Guinness World Record from 1991 for drawing the largest paying audience at a pop concert with 198,000 people at the Est√°dio do Maracan√£ stadium in Rio de Janeiro. In 2006 the band was awarded the Q Awards Inspiration Award. Ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro, a poll made it clear that the Norwegian band A-ha's appearance in 1991 and their record audience number that year was what people remembered best and the highlight of its 30-year history. As a result of this, A-ha were invited to reunite for a performance at the festival, celebrating 30 years since their debut album's release. Several bands and artists have mentioned that they like A-ha, including Chris Martin of Coldplay, Sarah Brightman, Adam Clayton of U2, Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Pitbull. Christina Aguilera and Pitbull performed the song \\"Feel This Moment\\" which contains sampling of A-ha's \\"Take On Me\\" live at the MGM Grand during the 2013 Billboard Music Awards with a surprise appearance from Morten Harket. Awards Following the success of their debut, the band was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1986 but did not win. A-ha did win eight MTV Video Music Awards, six for \\"Take On Me\\" and two for \\"The Sun Always Shines on TV\\". \\"Take On Me\\" was also nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Video at the American Music Awards of 1986. A-ha have won 10 Spellemannprisen awards, the Norwegian equivalent of the Grammy Awards. In November 2012, all three bandmates were appointed Knights of the 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for their contribution to Norwegian music.

The lordship was created as a papal fief following the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169‚Äì1171. As the lord of Ireland was also the king of England, he was represented locally by a governor, variously known as justiciar, lieutenant, or lord deputy. The kings of England claimed lordship over the whole island, but in reality the king's rule only ever extended to parts of the island. The rest of the island‚Äîknown as Gaelic Ireland‚Äîremained under the control of various Gaelic Irish kingdoms or chiefdoms, who were often at war with the Anglo-Normans. The area under English rule and law grew and shrank over time, and reached its greatest extent in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. The lordship then went into decline, brought on by its invasion by Scotland in 1315‚Äì18, the Great Famine of 1315‚Äì17, and the Black Death of the 1340s. The fluid political situation and English feudal system allowed a great deal of autonomy for the Anglo-Norman lords in Ireland, who carved out earldoms for themselves and had almost as much authority as some of the native Gaelic kings. Some Anglo-Normans became Gaelicised and rebelled against the English administration. The English attempted to curb this by passing the Statutes of Kilkenny (1366), which forbade English settlers from taking up Irish law, language, custom and dress. The period ended with the creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1542. History=Arrival of the Normans in Ireland= The authority of the Lordship of Ireland's government was seldom extended throughout the island of Ireland at any time during its existence but was restricted to the Pale around Dublin, and some provincial towns, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford and their hinterlands. It owed its origins to the decision of a Leinster dynast, Diarmait Mac Murchada (Diarmuid MacMorrough), to bring in a Norman knight based in Wales, Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (alias 'Strongbow'), to aid him in his battle to regain his throne, after being overthrown by a confederation led by the new Irish High King (the previous incumbent had protected MacMurrough). Henry II of England invaded Ireland to control Strongbow, who he feared was becoming a threat to the stability of his own kingdom on its western fringes (there had been earlier fears that Saxon refugees might use either Ireland or Flanders as a base for a counter-offensive after 1066); much of the later Plantagenet consolidation of South Wales was in furtherance of holding open routes to Ireland. =Henry Plantagenet and Laudabiliter= From 1155 Henry claimed that Pope Adrian IV had given him authorisation to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland. Religious practices and ecclesiastical organisation in Ireland had evolved divergently from those in areas of Europe influenced more directly by the Holy See, although many of these differences had been eliminated or greatly lessened by the time the bull was issued in 1155.. Further, the former Irish church had never sent its dues (\\"tithes\\") to Rome. Henry's primary motivation for invading Ireland in 1171 was to control Strongbow and other Norman lords. In the process he accepted the fealty of the Gaelic kings at Dublin in November 1171 and summoned the Synod of Cashel in 1172, this bringing the Irish Church into conformity with English and European norms. In 1175 the Treaty of Windsor was agreed by Henry and Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, High King of Ireland. The popes asserted the right to grant sovereignty over islands to different monarchs on the basis of the Donation of Constantine (now known to be a forgery). Doubts were cast by eminent scholars on Laudabiliter itself in the 19th century, but it was confirmed by the letters of Pope Alexander III. The Papal power to grant also fell within the remit of Dictatus papae (1075‚Äì1087). While Laudabiliter had referred to the \\"kingdom\\" of Ireland, the Papacy was ambiguous about continuing to describe it as a kingdom as early as 1185. =John Lackland as Lord of Ireland= Having captured a small part of Ireland on the east coast, Henry used the land to solve a dispute dividing his family. For he had divided his territories between his sons, with the youngest being nicknamed Johan sanz Terre (in English, \\"John Lackland\\") as he was left without lands to rule. At the Oxford parliament in May 1177, Henry replaced William FitzAldelm and granted John his Irish lands, so becoming Lord of Ireland (Dominus Hiberniae) in 1177 when he was 10 years old, with the territory being known in English as the Lordship of Ireland. Henry had wanted John to be crowned King of Ireland on his first visit in 1185, but Pope Lucius III specifically refused permission, citing the dubious nature of a claim supposedly provided by Pope Adrian IV years earlier.. \\"Dominus\\" was the usual title of a king who had not yet been crowned, suggesting that it was Henry's intention. Lucius then died while John was in Ireland, and Henry obtained consent from Pope Urban III and ordered a crown of gold and peacock feathers for John. In late 1185 the crown was ready, but John's visit had by then proved a complete failure, so Henry cancelled the coronation.. Following the deaths of John's older brothers he became King of England in 1199, and so the Lordship of Ireland, instead of being a separate country ruled by a junior Norman prince, came under the direct rule of the Angevin crown. In the legal terminology of John's successors, the \\"lordship of Ireland\\" referred to the sovereignty vested in the Crown of England; the corresponding territory was referred to as the \\"land of Ireland\\". =Perennial struggle with Gaeldom= The Pale (grey) in 1450 The Lordship thrived in the 13th century during the Medieval Warm Period, a time of warm climate and better harvests. The feudal system was introduced, and the Parliament of Ireland first sat in 1297. Some counties were created by shiring, while walled towns and castles became a feature of the landscape. But little of this engagement with mainstream European life was of benefit to those the Normans called the \\"mere Irish\\". \\"Mere\\" derived from the Latin merus, meaning \\"pure\\". Environmental decay and deforestation continued unabated throughout this period, being greatly exacerbated by the English newcomers and an increase in population. The Norman √©lite and churchmen spoke Norman French and Latin. Many poorer settlers spoke English, Welsh, and Flemish. The Gaelic areas spoke Irish dialects. The Yola language of County Wexford was a survivor of the early English dialects. The Kildare Poems of c. 1350 are a rare example of humorous local culture written in Middle English. The Lordship suffered invasion from Scotland by Edward Bruce in 1315‚Äì1318, which destroyed much of the economy and coincided with the great famine of 1315‚Äì1317. The earldom of Ulster ended in 1333, and the Black Death of 1348‚Äì1350 impacted more on the town-dwelling Normans than on the remaining Gaelic clans. The Norman and English colonists exhibited a tendency to adopt much of the native culture and language, becoming \\"Gaelicized\\" or in the words of some \\"More Irish than the Irish themselves\\". In 1366 the Statute of Kilkenny tried to keep aspects of Gaelic culture out of the Norman-controlled areas albeit in vain. As the Norman lordships became increasingly Gaelicized and made alliances with native chiefs, whose power steadily increased, crown control slowly eroded. Additionally, the Plantagenet government increasingly alienated the Irish chiefs and people on whom they often relied for their military strength. It had been a common practice for the Norman lordships as well as government forces to recruit the native Irish who were allied to them or living in English controlled areas (i.e. Leinster including Meath and Ossory, Munster and some parts of Connacht). This was easy to do as the native Irish had no great sense of national identity at that time and were prone to mercenarism and shifting alliances. But the Irish chiefs became increasingly alienated by the oppressive measures of the English government and began openly rebelling against the crown. Some of the more notable among those clans who had formerly cooperated with the English but became increasingly alienated until turning openly anti-Norman and a thorn in the side of the Dublin administration were the O'Connor Falys, the MacMurrough-Kavanagh dynasty, the Byrnes and the O'Mores of Leix. These clans were able to successfully defend their territories against English attack for a very long time through the use of asymmetrical guerrilla warfare and devastating raids into the lands held by the colonists. Additionally, the power of native chiefs who had never come under English domination such as the O'Neills and the O'Donnells increased steadily until these became once again major power players on the scene of Irish politics. Historians refer to a Gaelic revival or resurgence as occurring between 1350 and 1500, by which time the area ruled for the Crown ‚Äì \\"the Pale\\" ‚Äì had shrunk to a small area around Dublin. Between 1500 and 1542 a mixed situation arose. Most clans remained loyal to the Crown most of the time, at least in theory, but using a Gaelic-style system of alliances based on mutual favours, centered on the Lord Deputy who was usually the current Earl of Kildare. The Battle of Knockdoe in 1504 saw such a coalition army fight the Burkes in Galway. However, a rebellion by the 9th Earl's heir Silken Thomas in 1535 led on to a less sympathetic system of rule by mainly English- born administrators. The end of this rebellion and Henry VIII's seizure of the Irish monasteries around 1540 led on to his plan to create a new kingdom based on the existing parliament. =Transformation into a Kingdom= English monarchs continued to use the title \\"Lord of Ireland\\" to refer to their position of conquered lands on the island of Ireland. The title was changed by the Crown of Ireland Act passed by the Irish Parliament in 1542 when, on Henry VIII's demand, he was granted a new title, King of Ireland, with the state renamed the Kingdom of Ireland. Henry VIII changed his title because the Lordship of Ireland had been granted to the Norman monarchy by the Papacy; Henry had been excommunicated by the Catholic Church and worried that his title could be withdrawn by the Holy See. Henry VIII also wanted Ireland to be become a full kingdom to encourage a greater sense of loyalty amongst his Irish subjects, some of whom took part in his policy of surrender and regrant. To provide for greater security, a Royal Irish Army was established.

The right blue side is the intake port and the left brown side is the exhaust port. The cylinder wall is a thin sleeve surrounding the piston head which creates a space for the combustion of fuel and the genesis of mechanical energy. A four-stroke (also four-cycle) engine is an internal combustion (IC) engine in which the piston completes four separate strokes while turning the crankshaft. A stroke refers to the full travel of the piston along the cylinder, in either direction. The four separate strokes are termed: #Intake: Also known as induction or suction. This stroke of the piston begins at top dead center (T.D.C.) and ends at bottom dead center (B.D.C.). In this stroke the intake valve must be in the open position while the piston pulls an air-fuel mixture into the cylinder by producing vacuum pressure into the cylinder through its downward motion. The piston is moving down as air is being sucked in by the downward motion against the piston. #Compression: This stroke begins at B.D.C, or just at the end of the suction stroke, and ends at T.D.C. In this stroke the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in preparation for ignition during the power stroke (below). Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed during this stage. #Combustion: Also known as power or ignition. This is the start of the second revolution of the four stroke cycle. At this point the crankshaft has completed a full 360 degree revolution. While the piston is at T.D.C. (the end of the compression stroke) the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in a gasoline engine) or by heat generated by high compression (diesel engines), forcefully returning the piston to B.D.C. This stroke produces mechanical work from the engine to turn the crankshaft. #Exhaust: Also known as outlet. During the exhaust stroke, the piston, once again, returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the exhaust valve is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the exhaust valve.  History = Otto cycle = An Otto Engine from 1880s US Manufacture Nicolaus August Otto was a traveling salesman for a grocery concern. In his travels, he encountered the internal combustion engine built in Paris by Belgian expatriate Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir. In 1860, Lenoir successfully created a double-acting engine that ran on illuminating gas at 4% efficiency. The 18 litre Lenoir Engine produced only 2 horsepower. The Lenoir engine ran on illuminating gas made from coal, which had been developed in Paris by Philip Lebon. In testing a replica of the Lenoir engine in 1861, Otto became aware of the effects of compression on the fuel charge. In 1862, Otto attempted to produce an engine to improve on the poor efficiency and reliability of the Lenoir engine. He tried to create an engine that would compress the fuel mixture prior to ignition, but failed as that engine would run no more than a few minutes prior to its destruction. Many other engineers were trying to solve the problem, with no success. In 1864, Otto and Eugen Langen founded the first internal combustion engine production company, NA Otto and Cie (NA Otto and Company). Otto and Cie succeeded in creating a successful atmospheric engine that same year. The factory ran out of space and was moved to the town of Deutz, Germany in 1869, where the company was renamed to Deutz Gasmotorenfabrik AG (The Deutz Gas Engine Manufacturing Company). In 1872, Gottlieb Daimler was technical director and Wilhelm Maybach was the head of engine design. Daimler was a gunsmith who had worked on the Lenoir engine. By 1876, Otto and Langen succeeded in creating the first internal combustion engine that compressed the fuel mixture prior to combustion for far higher efficiency than any engine created to this time. Daimler and Maybach left their employ at Otto and Cie and developed the first high-speed Otto engine in 1883. In 1885, they produced the first automobile to be equipped with an Otto engine. The Daimler Reitwagen used a hot-tube ignition system and the fuel known as Ligroin to become the world's first vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine. It used a four-stroke engine based on Otto's design. The following year, Karl Benz produced a four-stroke engined automobile that is regarded as the first car.Ralph Stein (1967). The Automobile Book. Paul Hamlyn Ltd In 1884, Otto's company, then known as Gasmotorenfabrik Deutz (GFD), developed electric ignition and the carburetor. In 1890, Daimler and Maybach formed a company known as Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft. Today, that company is Daimler-Benz. = Atkinson cycle = This 2004 Toyota Prius hybrid has an Atkinson-cycle engine as the petrol-electric hybrid engine The Atkinson Gas Cycle The Atkinson-cycle engine is a type of single stroke internal combustion engine invented by James Atkinson in 1882. The Atkinson cycle is designed to provide efficiency at the expense of power density, and is used in some modern hybrid electric applications. The original Atkinson-cycle piston engine allowed the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes of the four-stroke cycle to occur in a single turn of the crankshaft and was designed to avoid infringing certain patents covering Otto-cycle engines. Due to the unique crankshaft design of the Atkinson, its expansion ratio can differ from its compression ratio and, with a power stroke longer than its compression stroke, the engine can achieve greater thermal efficiency than a traditional piston engine. While Atkinson's original design is no more than a historical curiosity, many modern engines use unconventional valve timing to produce the effect of a shorter compression stroke/longer power stroke, thus realizing the fuel economy improvements the Atkinson cycle can provide. =Diesel cycle= Audi Diesel R15 at Le Mans The diesel engine is a technical refinement of the 1876 Otto- cycle engine. Where Otto had realized in 1861 that the efficiency of the engine could be increased by first compressing the fuel mixture prior to its ignition, Rudolf Diesel wanted to develop a more efficient type of engine that could run on much heavier fuel. The Lenoir, Otto Atmospheric, and Otto Compression engines (both 1861 and 1876) were designed to run on Illuminating Gas (coal gas). With the same motivation as Otto, Diesel wanted to create an engine that would give small industrial companies their own power source to enable them to compete against larger companies, and like Otto, to get away from the requirement to be tied to a municipal fuel supply. Like Otto, it took more than a decade to produce the high-compression engine that could self- ignite fuel sprayed into the cylinder. Diesel used an air spray combined with fuel in his first engine. During initial development, one of the engines burst, nearly killing Diesel. He persisted, and finally created a successful engine in 1893. The high-compression engine, which ignites its fuel by the heat of compression, is now called the diesel engine, whether a four-stroke or two-stroke design. The four-stroke diesel engine has been used in the majority of heavy-duty applications for many decades. It uses a heavy fuel containing more energy and requiring less refinement to produce. The most efficient Otto- cycle engines run near 30% thermal efficiency. Thermodynamic analysis p-V diagram: the intake (A) stroke is performed by an isobaric expansion, followed by the compression (B) stroke, performed by an adiabatic compression. Through the combustion of fuel an isochoric process is produced, followed by an adiabatic expansion, characterizing the power (C) stroke. The cycle is closed by an isochoric process and an isobaric compression, characterizing the exhaust (D) stroke. The thermodynamic analysis of the actual four-stroke and two-stroke cycles is not a simple task. However, the analysis can be simplified significantly if air standard assumptions are utilized. The resulting cycle, which closely resembles the actual operating conditions, is the Otto cycle. During normal operation of the engine, as the air/fuel mixture is being compressed, an electric spark is created to ignite the mixture. At low rpm this occurs close to TDC (Top Dead Centre). As engine rpm rises, the speed of the flame front does not change so the spark point is advanced earlier in the cycle to allow a greater proportion of the cycle for the charge to combust before the power stroke commences. This advantage is reflected in the various Otto engine designs; the atmospheric (non- compression) engine operates at 12% efficiency whereas the compressed-charge engine has an operating efficiency around 30%. Fuel considerations A problem with compressed charge engines is that the temperature rise of the compressed charge can cause pre-ignition. If this occurs at the wrong time and is too energetic, it can damage the engine. Different fractions of petroleum have widely varying flash points (the temperatures at which the fuel may self- ignite). This must be taken into account in engine and fuel design. The tendency for the compressed fuel mixture to ignite early is limited by the chemical composition of the fuel. There are several grades of fuel to accommodate differing performance levels of engines. The fuel is altered to change its self ignition temperature. There are several ways to do this. As engines are designed with higher compression ratios the result is that pre- ignition is much more likely to occur since the fuel mixture is compressed to a higher temperature prior to deliberate ignition. The higher temperature more effectively evaporates fuels such as gasoline, which increases the efficiency of the compression engine. Higher Compression ratios also means that the distance that the piston can push to produce power is greater (which is called the Expansion ratio). The octane rating of a given fuel is a measure of the fuel's resistance to self-ignition. A fuel with a higher numerical octane rating allows for a higher compression ratio, which extracts more energy from the fuel and more effectively converts that energy into useful work while at the same time preventing engine damage from pre-ignition. High Octane fuel is also more expensive. Many modern four-stroke engines employ gasoline direct injection or GDI. In a gasoline direct-injected engine, the injector nozzle protrudes into the combustion chamber. The direct fuel injector injects gasoline under a very high pressure into the cylinder during the compression stroke, when the piston is closer to the top. Diesel engines by their nature do not have concerns with pre-ignition. They have a concern with whether or not combustion can be started. The description of how likely Diesel fuel is to ignite is called the Cetane rating. Because Diesel fuels are of low volatility, they can be very hard to start when cold. Various techniques are used to start a cold Diesel engine, the most common being the use of a glow plug. Design and engineering principles= Power output limitations = right250pxthumbThe four-stroke cycle 1=TDC 2=BDC A: Intake B: Compression C: Power D: Exhaust The maximum amount of power generated by an engine is determined by the maximum amount of air ingested. The amount of power generated by a piston engine is related to its size (cylinder volume), whether it is a two- stroke engine or four-stroke design, volumetric efficiency, losses, air-to- fuel ratio, the calorific value of the fuel, oxygen content of the air and speed (RPM). The speed is ultimately limited by material strength and lubrication. Valves, pistons and connecting rods suffer severe acceleration forces. At high engine speed, physical breakage and piston ring flutter can occur, resulting in power loss or even engine destruction. Piston ring flutter occurs when the rings oscillate vertically within the piston grooves they reside in. Ring flutter compromises the seal between the ring and the cylinder wall, which causes a loss of cylinder pressure and power. If an engine spins too quickly, valve springs cannot act quickly enough to close the valves. This is commonly referred to as 'valve float', and it can result in piston to valve contact, severely damaging the engine. At high speeds the lubrication of piston cylinder wall interface tends to break down. This limits the piston speed for industrial engines to about 10 m/s.  Intake/exhaust port flow  The output power of an engine is dependent on the ability of intake (air‚Äìfuel mixture) and exhaust matter to move quickly through valve ports, typically located in the cylinder head. To increase an engine's output power, irregularities in the intake and exhaust paths, such as casting flaws, can be removed, and, with the aid of an air flow bench, the radii of valve port turns and valve seat configuration can be modified to reduce resistance. This process is called porting, and it can be done by hand or with a CNC machine. = Waste heat recovery of an internal combustion engine = An internal combustion engine is on average capable of converting only 40-45% of supplied energy into mechanical work. A large part of the waste energy is in the form of heat that is released to the environment through coolant, fins etc. If we could somehow recover the waste heat we can improve the engine's performance. It has been found that even if 6% of the entirely wasted heat is recovered it can increase the engine efficiency greatly. Many methods have been devised in order to extract waste heat out of an engine exhaust and use it further to extract some useful work, decreasing the exhaust pollutants at the same time. Use of the Rankine Cycle, turbocharging and thermoelectric generation can be very useful as a waste heat recovery system. Though these systems are used more frequently some issues, like their low efficiency at lower heat supply rates and high pumping losses, remain a cause of concern.  Supercharging  One way to increase engine power is to force more air into the cylinder so that more power can be produced from each power stroke. This can be done using some type of air compression device known as a supercharger, which can be powered by the engine crankshaft. Supercharging increases the power output limits of an internal combustion engine relative to its displacement. Most commonly, the supercharger is always running, but there have been designs that allow it to be cut out or run at varying speeds (relative to engine speed). Mechanically driven supercharging has the disadvantage that some of the output power is used to drive the supercharger, while power is wasted in the high pressure exhaust, as the air has been compressed twice and then gains more potential volume in the combustion but it is only expanded in one stage.  Turbocharging  A turbocharger is a supercharger that is driven by the engine's exhaust gases, by means of a turbine. A turbocharger is incorporated into the exhaust system of a vehicle to make use of the expelled exhaust. It consists of a two piece, high-speed turbine assembly with one side that compresses the intake air, and the other side that is powered by the exhaust gas outflow. When idling, and at low-to-moderate speeds, the turbine produces little power from the small exhaust volume, the turbocharger has little effect and the engine operates nearly in a naturally aspirated manner. When much more power output is required, the engine speed and throttle opening are increased until the exhaust gases are sufficient to 'spool up' the turbocharger's turbine to start compressing much more air than normal into the intake manifold. Thus, additional power (and speed) is expelled through the function of this turbine. Turbocharging allows for more efficient engine operation because it is driven by exhaust pressure that would otherwise be (mostly) wasted, but there is a design limitation known as turbo lag. The increased engine power is not immediately available due to the need to sharply increase engine RPM, to build up pressure and to spin up the turbo, before the turbo starts to do any useful air compression. The increased intake volume causes increased exhaust and spins the turbo faster, and so forth until steady high power operation is reached. Another difficulty is that the higher exhaust pressure causes the exhaust gas to transfer more of its heat to the mechanical parts of the engine. = Rod and piston-to-stroke ratio = The rod-to-stroke ratio is the ratio of the length of the connecting rod to the length of the piston stroke. A longer rod reduces sidewise pressure of the piston on the cylinder wall and the stress forces, increasing engine life. It also increases the cost and engine height and weight. A \\"square engine\\" is an engine with a bore diameter equal to its stroke length. An engine where the bore diameter is larger than its stroke length is an oversquare engine, conversely, an engine with a bore diameter that is smaller than its stroke length is an undersquare engine. = Valve train = The valves are typically operated by a camshaft rotating at half the speed of the crankshaft. It has a series of cams along its length, each designed to open a valve during the appropriate part of an intake or exhaust stroke. A tappet between valve and cam is a contact surface on which the cam slides to open the valve. Many engines use one or more camshafts ‚Äúabove‚Äù a row (or each row) of cylinders, as in the illustration, in which each cam directly actuates a valve through a flat tappet. In other engine designs the camshaft is in the crankcase, in which case each cam usually contacts a push rod, which contacts a rocker arm that opens a valve, or in case of a flathead engine a push rod is not necessary. The overhead cam design typically allows higher engine speeds because it provides the most direct path between cam and valve.  Valve clearance  Valve clearance refers to the small gap between a valve lifter and a valve stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too-small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly. This results in a loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each with a feeler gauge. Most modern production engines use hydraulic lifters to automatically compensate for valve train component wear. Dirty engine oil may cause lifter failure. =Energy balance= Otto engines are about 30% efficient; in other words, 30% of the energy generated by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine, while the remainder being losses due to waste heat, friction and engine accessories. There are a number of ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat. The use of a Turbocharger in Diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect, provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement. The Mack Truck company, decades ago, developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed back into the engine's transmission. In 2005, BMW announced the development of the turbosteamer, a two-stage heat-recovery system similar to the Mack system that recovers 80% of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by 15%. By contrast, a six-stroke engine may reduce fuel consumption by as much as 40%. Modern engines are often intentionally built to be slightly less efficient than they could otherwise be. This is necessary for emission controls such as exhaust gas recirculation and catalytic converters that reduce smog and other atmospheric pollutants. Reductions in efficiency may be counteracted with an engine control unit using lean burn techniques. In the United States, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy mandates that vehicles must achieve an average of compared to the current standard of . As automakers look to meet these standards by 2016, new ways of engineering the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) have to be considered. Some potential solutions to increase fuel efficiency to meet new mandates include firing after the piston is farthest from the crankshaft, known as top dead centre, and applying the Miller cycle. Together, this redesign could significantly reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

During the First World War he served in the small War Cabinet of Prime Minister David Lloyd George as Leader of the House of Lords (from December 1916), as well as the War Policy Committee. He served as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1919 to 1924. Despite his successes as both Viceroy and Foreign Secretary, in 1923 Curzon was denied the office of prime minister. Bonar Law and other Conservative Party leaders preferred to have Stanley Baldwin rather than Curzon as prime minister and these views were made known to King George V. Sir David Gilmour, in his biography Curzon: Imperial Statesman (1994), contends that Curzon deserved the top position.  Early life  Curzon was educated at All Souls College, Oxford, of which he was a Prize Fellow Curzon was the eldest son and the second of the eleven children of Alfred Curzon, 4th Baron Scarsdale (1831‚Äì1916), who was the Rector of Kedleston in Derbyshire. George Curzon's mother was Blanche (1837‚Äì1875), the daughter of Joseph Pocklington Senhouse of Netherhall in Cumberland. He was born at Kedleston Hall, built on the site where his family, who were of Norman ancestry, had lived since the 12th century. His mother, exhausted by childbirth, died when George was 16; her husband survived her by 41 years. Neither parent exerted a major influence on Curzon's life. Scarsdale was an austere and unindulgent father who believed in the long-held family tradition that landowners should stay on their land and not go \\"roaming about all over the world\\". He thus had little sympathy for those journeys across Asia between 1887 and 1895 which made his son one of the most travelled men who ever sat in a British cabinet. A more decisive presence in Curzon's childhood was that of his brutal, sadistic governess, Ellen Mary Paraman, whose tyranny in the nursery stimulated his combative qualities and encouraged the obsessional side of his nature. Paraman used to beat him and periodically forced him to parade through the village wearing a conical hat bearing the words liar, sneak, and coward. Curzon later noted, \\"No children well born and well-placed ever cried so much and so justly.\\"Empire, Niall Ferguson Curzon at Eton, 1870s He was educated at Wixenford School,Philip Holden, Autobiography and Decolonization: Modernity, Masculinity, and the Nation-state (2008), p. 46 Eton College,Eton, the Raj and modern India; By Alastair Lawson; 9 March 2005; BBC News. and Balliol College, Oxford. At Eton, he was a favourite of Oscar Browning, an over-intimate relationship that led to his tutor's dismissal.\\"... Oscar Browning (1837‚Äì1923), who had been sacked from Eton in September 1875 under suspicion of paederasty, partly because of his involvement with young George Nathaniel Curzon\\" in Michael Kaylor, Secreted Desires 2006 p.98\\"His intimate, indiscreet friendship with a boy in another boarding-house, G. N. Curzon [...] provoked a crisis with [Headmaster] Hornby [‚Ä¶.] Amid national controversy he was dismissed in 1875 on the pretext of administrative inefficiency but actually because his influence was thought to be sexually contagious\\" in Richard Davenport-Hines, Oscar Browning DNB A spinal injury incurred whilst riding during his adolescence left Curzon in lifelong pain, which often caused insomnia, and which required him to wear a metal corset for the duration of his life. At Oxford, Curzon was President of the Union and Secretary of the Oxford Canning Club (a Tory political club named for George Canning): as a consequence of the extent of his time-expenditure on political and social societies, he failed to achieve a first class degree in Greats, although he subsequently won both the Lothian and Arnold Prizes, the latter for an essay on Sir Thomas More, about whom he confessed to having known almost nothing before commencing study). In 1883, Curzon received the most prestigious fellowship at the university, a Prize Fellowship at All Souls College. Whilst at Eton and at Oxford, Curzon was a contemporary and close friend of Cecil Spring Rice and Edward Grey. However, Spring Rice contributed, alongside John William Mackail, to the composition of a famous sardonic doggerel about Curzon that was published as part of The Balliol Masque, about which Curzon wrote in later life \\"never has more harm been done to one single individual than that accursed doggerel has done to me.\\" It ran: :My name is George Nathaniel Curzon, :I am a most superior person. :My cheek is pink, my hair is sleek, :I dine at Blenheim once a week. When Spring-Rice was British Ambassador to the United States, he was suspected by Curzon of trying to prevent Curzon's engagement to the American Mary Leiter, whom Curzon nevertheless married. However, Spring Rice assumed for a certainty, like many of Curzon's other friends, that Curzon would inevitably become Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: he wrote to Curzon in 1891, 'When you are Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs I hope you will restore the vanished glory of England, lead the European concert, decide the fate of nations, and give me three month's leave instead of two'.Garter-encircled shield of arms of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, KG, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel.  Early political career  Curzon became Assistant Private Secretary to Salisbury in 1885, and in 1886 entered Parliament as Member for Southport in south-west Lancashire. His maiden speech, which was chiefly an attack on home rule and Irish nationalism, was regarded in much the same way as his oratory at the Oxford Union: brilliant and eloquent but also presumptuous and rather too self-assured. Subsequent performances in the Commons, often dealing with Ireland or reform of the House of Lords (which he supported), received similar verdicts. He was Under- Secretary of State for India in 1891‚Äì92 and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in 1895‚Äì98. Asian travels and writings In the meantime he had travelled around the world: Russia and Central Asia (1888‚Äì89), a long tour of Persia (September 1889 ‚Äì January 1890), Siam, French Indochina and Korea (1892), and a daring foray into Afghanistan and the Pamirs (1894). He published several books describing central and eastern Asia and related policy issues. A bold and compulsive traveler, fascinated by oriental life and geography, he was awarded the Patron's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his exploration of the source of the Amu Darya (Oxus). His journeys allowed him to study the problems of Asia and their implications for British India, whilst reinforcing his pride in his nation and her imperial mission. Curzon believed Russia to be the most likely threat to India, Britain's most valuable colony, from the 19th century through the early 20th century.Curzon, Russia in Central Asia (1967), p. 314. In 1879 Russia had begun construction of the Transcaspian Railroad along the Silk Road, officially solely to enforce local control. The line starts from the city of Kzyzl Su (Krasnovodsk) (nowadays Turkmenbashi) (on the Caspian Sea), travels southeast along the Karakum Desert, through Ashgabat, continues along the Kopet Dagh Mountains until it reaches Tejen. Curzon dedicated an entire chapter in his book Russia in Central Asia to discussing the perceived threat to British control of India.Curzon, Russia in Central Asia (1967), p. 272. This railroad connected Russia with the most wealthy and influential cities in Central Asia at the time, including the Persian province of Khorasan,Denis Wright, \\"Curzon and Persia,\\" The Geographical Journal 153#3 (November 1987): 343. and would allow the rapid deployment of Russian supplies and troops into the area. Curzon also believed that the resulting greater economic interdependence between Russia and Central Asia would be damaging to British interests.Curzon, Russia in Central Asia p. 277. Persia and the Persian Question, written in 1892, has been considered Curzon's magnum opus and can be seen as a sequel to Russia in Central Asia.Denis Wright, \\"Curzon and Persia,\\" The Geographical Journal 153#3 (November 1987):346. Curzon was commissioned by The Times to write several articles on the Persian political environment, but while there he decided to write a book on the country as whole. This two- volume work covers Persia's history and governmental structure, as well as graphics, maps and pictures (some taken by Curzon himself). Curzon was aided by General Albert Houtum-Schindler and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), both of which helped him gain access to material to which as a foreigner he would not have been entitled to have access. General Schindler provided Curzon with information regarding Persia's geography and resources, as well as serving as an unofficial editor.Wright, \\"Curzon and Persia,\\" pp 346‚Äì7 Curzon was appalled by his government's apathy towards Persia as a valuable defensive buffer to India from Russian encroachment. Years later Curzon would lament that \\"Persia has alternatively advanced and receded in the estimation of British statesmen, occupying now a position of extravagant prominence, anon one of unmerited obscurity.\\"George N. Curzon, Persia and the Persian Question (Volume 1). New York: Barnes & Noble, 1966, p 605.  First marriage (1895‚Äì1906)  Mary Victoria Leiter by Alexandre Cabanel, 1887 In 1895 he married Mary Victoria Leiter, the daughter of Levi Ziegler Leiter, an American millionaire of German Mennonite origin and co-founder of the Chicago department store Field & Leiter (later Marshall Field). Initially, he had just married her for her money so he could save his estate but ended up nursing feelings for her. Mary had a long and nearly fatal illness near the end of summer 1904, from which she never really recovered. Falling ill again in July 1906, she died on the 18th of that month in her husband's arms, at the age of 36.Maximilian Genealogy Master Database, Mary Victoria LEITER, 2000 It was the greatest personal loss of his life. She was buried in the church at Kedleston, where Curzon designed his memorial for her, a Gothic chapel added to the north side of the nave. Although he was neither a devout nor a conventional churchman, Curzon retained a simple religious faith; in later years he sometimes said that he was not afraid of death because it would enable him to join Mary in heaven. They had three daughters during a firm and happy marriage: Mary Irene, who inherited her father's Barony of Ravensdale and was created a life peer in her own right; Cynthia, who became the first wife of the fascist politician Sir Oswald Mosley; and Alexandra Naldera (\\"Baba\\"), who married Edward \\"Fruity\\" Metcalfe, the best friend, best man and equerry of Edward VIII. Mosley exercised a strange fascination for the Curzon women: Irene had a brief romance with him before either were married; Baba became his mistress; and Curzon's second wife, Grace, had a long affair with him.

Curzon and his wife and staff on tour of the Persian Gulf in 1903 In January 1899 he was appointed Viceroy of India. He was created a Peer of Ireland as Baron Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, on his appointment. This peerage was created in the Peerage of Ireland (the last so created) so that he would be free, until his father's death, to re-enter the House of Commons on his return to Britain. Reaching India shortly after the suppression of the frontier risings of 1897‚Äì98, he paid special attention to the independent tribes of the north-west frontier, inaugurated a new province called the North West Frontier Province, and pursued a policy of forceful control mingled with conciliation. The only major armed outbreak on this frontier during the period of his administration was the Mahsud‚ÄìWaziri campaign of 1901. In the context of the Great Game between the British and Russian Empires for control of Central Asia, he held deep mistrust of Russian intentions. This led him to encourage British trade in Persia, and he paid a visit to the Persian Gulf in 1903. Curzon argued for an exclusive British presence in the Gulf, a policy originally proposed by John Malcolm. The British government was already making agreements with local sheiks/tribal leaders along the Persian Gulf coast to this end. Curzon had convinced his government to establish Britain as the unofficial protector of Kuwait with the Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899. The Lansdowne Declaration in 1903 stated that the British would counter any other European power's attempt to establish a military presence in the Gulf.M. E. Yapp, \\"British Perceptions of the Russian Threat to India,\\" Modern Asian Studies 21#4 (1987): 655. Only four years later this position was abandoned and the Persian Gulf declared a neutral zone in the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, prompted in part by the high economic cost of defending India from Russian advances.Yapp, pp 655, 664. At the end of 1903, Curzon sent a British expedition to Tibet under Francis Younghusband, ostensibly to forestall a Russian advance. After bloody conflicts with Tibet's poorly armed defenders, the mission penetrated to Lhasa, where a treaty was signed in September 1904. No Russian presence was found in Lhasa. During his tenure, Curzon undertook the restoration of the Taj Mahal and expressed satisfaction that he had done so. Within India, Curzon appointed a number of commissions to inquire into education, irrigation, police and other branches of administration, on whose reports legislation was based during his second term of office as viceroy. Reappointed Governor-General in August 1904, he presided over the 1905 partition of Bengal, which roused such bitter opposition among the people of the province that it was later revoked (1911). = Indian Army = Curzon also took an active interest in military matters. In 1901, he founded the Imperial Cadet Corps, or ICC. The ICC was a corps d'elite, designed to give Indian princes and aristocrats military training, after which a few would be given officer commissions in the Indian Army. But these commissions were \\"special commissions\\" which did not empower their holders to command any troops. Predictably, this was a major stumbling block to the ICC's success, as it caused much resentment among former cadets. Though the ICC closed in 1914, it was a crucial stage in the drive to Indianise the Indian Army's officer Corps, which was haltingly begun in 1917. Military organisation proved to be the final issue faced by Curzon in India. It often involved petty issues that had much to do with clashes of personality: Curzon once wrote on a document \\"I rise from the perusal of these papers filled with the sense of the ineptitude of my military advisers\\", and once wrote to the Commander-in-Chief in India, Kitchener, advising him that signing himself \\"Kitchener of Khartoum\\" took up too much time and space, which Kitchener thought petty (Curzon simply signed himself \\"Curzon\\" as if he were a hereditary peer, although he later took to signing himself \\"Curzon of Kedleston\\").Reid 2006, p116 A difference of opinion with Kitchener, regarding the status of the military member of the council in India (who controlled army supply and logistics, which Kitchener wanted under his own control), led to a controversy in which Curzon failed to obtain the support of the home government. He resigned in August 1905 and returned to England. = Indian famine = A major famine coincided with Curzon's time as viceroy in which 1 to 4.5 million people died.Fagan, Brian (2009), Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations, Basic Books. p. 13 Quote: \\"In the later nineteenth century there was a series of disastrous crop failures in India leading not only to starvation but to epidemics. Most were regional, but the death toll could be huge. Thus, to take only some of the worst famines for which the death rate is known, some 800,000 died in the North West Provinces, Punjab, and Rajasthan in 1837‚Äì38; perhaps 2 million in the same region in 1860‚Äì61; nearly a million in different areas in 1866‚Äì67; 4.3 million in widely spread areas in 1876‚Äì78, an additional 1.2 million in the North West Provinces and Kashmir in 1877‚Äì78; and, worst of all, over 5 million in a famine that affected a large population of India in 1896‚Äì97. In 1899‚Äì1900 more than a million were thought to have died, conditions being worse because of the shortage of food following the famines only two years earlier. Thereafter the only major loss of life through famine was in 1943 under exceptional wartime conditions.(p. 132)\\"Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. pg 158 Large parts of India were affected and millions died, and Curzon has been criticised for allegedly having done little to fight the famine.Mike Davis: Late Victorian Holocausts Curzon did implement a variety of measures, including opening up famine relief works that fed between 3 and 5 million, reducing taxes and spending vast amounts of money on irrigation works.David Gilmour's Curzon and Ruling Caste. In Curzon he writes that 3.5 million were on famine relief, in Ruling Caste he writes it was over five million. But he also stated that \\"any government which imperiled the financial position of India in the interests of prodigal philanthropy would be open to serious criticism; but any government which by indiscriminate alms-giving weakened the fibre and demoralized the self-reliance of the population, would be guilty of a public crime.\\"Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. pg 162 He also cut back rations that he characterized as \\"dangerously high\\" and stiffened relief eligibility by reinstating the Temple tests.Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1. Verso, 2000. pg 164  Return to Britain  Arthur Balfour's refusal to recommend an earldom for Curzon in 1905 was repeated by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Liberal Prime Minister, who formed his government the day after Curzon returned to England. In deference to the wishes of the King and the advice of his doctors, Curzon did not stand in the general election of 1906 and thus found himself excluded from public life for the first time in twenty years. It was at this time, the nadir of his career, that he suffered the greatest personal loss of his life. Mary died in 1906 and Curzon devoted himself to private matters, including establishing a new home. After the death of Lord Goschen in 1907, the post of Chancellor of Oxford University fell vacant. Curzon successfully became elected as Chancellor of Oxford after he won by 1001 votes to 440 against Lord Rosebery. He proved to be quite an active Chancellor ‚Äì \\"[he] threw himself so energetically into the cause of university reform that critics complained he was ruling Oxford like an Indian province.\\"Oxford DNB House of Lords In 1908, Curzon was elected a representative peer for Ireland, and thus relinquished any idea of returning to the House of Commons. In 1909‚Äì1910 he took an active part in opposing the Liberal government's proposal to abolish the legislative veto of the House of Lords, and in 1911 was created Baron Ravensdale, of Ravensdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to his daughters, Viscount Scarsdale, of Scarsdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to the heirs male of his father, and Earl Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, with the normal remainder, all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He became involved with saving Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire, from destruction. This experience strengthened his resolve for heritage protection. He was one of the sponsors of the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913. On 5 May 1914, he spoke out against a bill in the House of Lords that would have permitted women who already had the right to vote in local elections the right to vote for members of Parliament.  First World War  Curzon joined the Cabinet, as Lord Privy Seal, when Asquith formed his coalition in May 1915. Like other politicians (e.g. Austen Chamberlain, Arthur Balfour) Curzon favoured British Empire efforts in Mesopotamia, believing that the increase in British prestige would discourage a German-inspired Muslim revolt in India.Woodward, 1998, pp113, 118‚Äì9 Curzon was a member of the Dardanelles Committee and told that body (October 1915) that the recent Salonika expedition was \\"quixotic chivalry\\".Woodward, 1998, p.16 Early in 1916 Curzon visited Sir Douglas Haig (newly appointed Commander- in-Chief of British forces in France) at his headquarters in France. Haig was impressed by Curzon's brains and decisiveness, considering that he had mellowed since his days as Viceroy (the then Major-General Haig had been Inspector-General of Cavalry, India, at the time) and had lost \\"his old pompous ways\\".Groot 1988, p.226‚Äì7 Curzon served in Lloyd George's small War Cabinet as Leader of the House of Lords from December 1916, and he also served on the War Policy Committee. With Allied victory over Germany far from certain, Curzon wrote a paper (12 May 1917) for the War Cabinet urging that Britain seize Palestine and possibly Syria.Woodward, 1998, pp.155‚Äì7 However, like other members of the War Cabinet, Curzon supported further Western Front offensives lest, with Russian commitment to the war wavering, France and Italy be tempted to make a separate peace. At the War Policy Committee (3 October 1917) Curzon objected in vain to plans to redeploy two divisions to Palestine, with a view to advancing into Syria and knocking Turkey out of the war altogether. Curzon's commitment wavered somewhat as the losses of Third Ypres mounted.Woodward, 1998, pp134, 159‚Äì61, In the summer of 1917 the CIGS General Robertson sent Haig a biting description of the members of the War Cabinet, who he said were all frightened of Lloyd George; he described Curzon as \\"a gasbag\\". During the crisis of February 1918, Curzon was one of the few members of the government to support Robertson, threatening in vain to resign if he were removed.Woodward, 1998, p.200 Despite his continued opposition to votes for women (he had been co-president of the National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage), the House of Lords voted conclusively in its favour.  Second marriage (1917)  Grace Elvina, second wife After a long affair with the romantic novelist Elinor Glyn, Curzon married the former Grace Elvina Hinds in January 1917. She was the wealthy Alabama-born widow of Alfredo Huberto Duggan (died 1915), a first-generation Irish Argentinian appointed to the Argentine Legation in London in 1905. Elinor Glyn was staying with Curzon at the time of the engagement and read about it in the morning newspapers. Grace had three children from her first marriage, two sons, Alfred and Hubert, and a daughter, Grace Lucille. Alfred and Hubert, as Curzon's step-sons, grew up within his influential circle. Curzon had three daughters from his first marriage, but he and Grace (despite fertility-related operations and several miscarriages) did not have any children together, which put a strain on their marriage. Letters written between them in the early 1920s imply that they still lived together, and remained devoted to each other. In 1923, Curzon was passed over for the office of Prime Minister partly on the advice of Arthur Balfour, who joked that Curzon \\"has lost the hope of glory but he still possesses the means of Grace\\" (a humorous allusion to the well known \\"General Thanksgiving\\" prayer of the Church of England, which thanks God for \\"the means of grace, and for the hope of glory\\"). In 1917, Curzon bought Bodiam Castle in East Sussex, a 14th- century building that had been gutted during the English Civil War. He restored it extensively, then bequeathed it to the National Trust.Channel 4 history microsites: Bodiam Castle  Foreign Secretary (1919‚Äì24)  Statue of Curzon in front of the Calcutta Victoria Memorial =Relations with Lloyd George= Curzon did not have David Lloyd George's support. Curzon and Lloyd George had disliked one another since the 1911 Parliament Crisis. The Prime Minister thought him overly pompous and self-important, and it was said that he used him as if he were using a Rolls-Royce to deliver a parcel to the station; Lloyd George said much later that Churchill treated his Ministers in a way that Lloyd George would never have treated his: \\"They were all men of substance ‚Äî well, except Curzon.\\"Michael Foot: Aneurin Bevan Multiple drafts of resignation letters written at this time were found upon Curzon's death. Despite their antagonism, the two were often in agreement on government policy.Johnson, Gaynor \\"Preparing for Office: Lord Curzon as Acting Foreign Secretary, January- October 1919.\\" Contemporary British History 18.3 (2004): 56. Lloyd George needed the wealth of knowledge Curzon possessed so was both his biggest critic and, simultaneously, his largest supporter. Likewise, Curzon was grateful for the leeway he was allowed by Lloyd George when it came to handling affairs in the Middle East.G.H. Bennett, \\"Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919‚Äì22,\\" Australian Journal of Politics & History 45#4 (1999): 479. Other cabinet ministers also respected his vast knowledge of Central Asia but disliked his arrogance and often blunt criticism. Believing that the Foreign Secretary should be non-partisan, he would objectively present all the information on a subject to the Cabinet, as if placing faith in his colleagues to reach the appropriate decision. Conversely, Curzon would take personally and respond aggressively to any criticism. It has been suggested that Curzon's defensiveness reflected institutional insecurity by the Foreign Office as a whole. During the 1920s the Foreign Office was often a passive participant in decisions which were mainly reactive and dominated by the Prime Minister.Sharp, Alan \\"Adapting to a New World? British Foreign Policy in the 1920s.\\" Contemporary British History 18.3 (2004): 76. The creation of the job of Colonial Secretary, the Cabinet Secretariat and the League of Nations added to the Foreign Office's insecurity. =Policy under Lloyd George= Formerly German provinces annexed by Poland after World War II. Grey: Pre‚ÄìWorld War II Polish territory east of the Curzon Line annexed by the Soviet Union after the war. After nine months as acting Secretary while Balfour was at the Paris Peace Conference,Gaynor Johnson, \\"Preparing for Office: Lord Curzon as Acting Foreign Secretary, January‚ÄìOctober 1919\\", Contemporary British History, vol. 18, n¬∞3, 2004, pp. 53‚Äì73. Curzon was appointed Foreign Secretary in October 1919. He gave his name to the British government's proposed Soviet-Polish boundary, the Curzon Line of December 1919. Although during the subsequent Polish-Soviet War, Poland conquered ground in the east, after World War II, Poland was shifted westwards, leaving the border between Poland and its eastern neighbours today approximately at the Curzon Line. Curzon was largely responsible for the Peace Day ceremonies on 19 July 1919. These included the plaster Cenotaph, designed by the noted British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, for the Allied Victory parade in London. It was so successful that it was reproduced in stone, and still stands. In 1918, during World War I, as Britain occupied Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), Curzon tried to convince the Indian government to reconsider his scheme for Persia (Iran) to be a buffer against Russian advances.Yapp, p. 654. British and Indian troops were in Persia protecting the oilfields at Abadan and watching the Afghan frontier ‚Äì Curzon believed that British economic and military aid, sent via India, could prop up the Persian government and make her a British client state. However, the agreement of August 1919 was never ratified and the British government rejected the plan as Russia had the geographical advantage and the defensive benefits would not justify the high economic cost.Yapp, p. 653. Small British forces had twice occupied Baku on the Caspian in 1918, while an entire British division had occupied Batum on the Black Sea, supervising German and Turkish withdrawal. Against Curzon's wishes, but on the advice of Sir George Milne, the commander on the spot, the CIGS Henry Wilson, who wanted to concentrate troops in Britain, Ireland, India, and Egypt,Jeffery 2006, pp. 251‚Äì252. and of Churchill (Secretary of State for War), the British withdrew from Baku (the small British naval presence was also withdrawn from the Caspian Sea), at the end of August 1919 leaving only 3 battalions at Batum. In January 1920 Curzon insisted that British troops remain in Batum, against the wishes of Wilson and the Prime Minister. In February, while Curzon was on holiday, Wilson persuaded the Cabinet to allow withdrawal, but Curzon had the decision reversed on his return, although to Curzon's fury (he thought it \\"abuse of authority\\") Wilson gave Milne permission to withdraw if he deemed it necessary. At Cabinet on 5 May 1920 Curzon \\"by a long-winded jaw\\" (in Wilson's description) argued for a stay in Batum. After a British garrison at Enzeli (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on a withdrawal from Batum early in June 1920. For the rest of 1920 Curzon, supported by Milner (Colonial Secretary), argued that Britain should retain control of Persia. When Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull troops out of Persia to put down the rebellion in Mesopotamia and Ireland, Lloyd George blocked the move, saying that Curzon \\"would not stand it\\". In the end, financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal from Persia in the spring of 1921.Jeffery 2006, pp. 233‚Äì234, 247‚Äì251. Curzon worked on several Middle Eastern problems. He designed the Treaty of S√®vres (August 10, 1920) between the victorious Allies and Ottoman Turkey. The treaty abolished the Ottoman Empire and obliged Turkey to renounce all rights over Arab Asia and North Africa. However a new government in Turkey under Kemal Atat√ºrk rejected the treaty. The Greeks invaded Turkey. Curzon tried and failed to induce the Greeks to accept a compromise on the status of Smyrna and failed to force the Turks to renounce their nationalist program. Lloyd George tried to use force at Chanak but lost support and was forced to step down as prime minister. Curzon remained as foreign minister and helped tie down loose ends in the Middle East at the peace conference at Lausanne.Domna Visvizi-Dontas, \\"The Allied powers and the Eastern Question 1921-1923.\\" Balkan Studies 17.2 (1976): 331-357 online. He helped to negotiate Egyptian independence (granted in 1922) and the division of the British Mandate of Palestine, despite the strong disagreement he held with the policy of his predecessor Arthur Balfour, and helped create the Emirate of Transjordan for Faisal's brother, which may also have delayed the problems there. According to Sir David Gilmour, Curzon \\"was the only senior figure in the British government at the time who foresaw that its policy would lead to decades of Arab‚ÄìJewish hostility\\". During the Irish War of Independence, but before the introduction of martial law in December 1920, Curzon suggested the \\"Indian\\" solution of blockading villages and imposing collective fines for attacks on the police and army.Jeffery 2006, pp. 266‚Äì267. In 1921 Curzon was created Earl of Kedleston, in the County of Derby, and Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. In 1922, he was the chief negotiator for the Allies of the Treaty of Lausanne, which officially ended the war with the Ottoman Empire and defined the borders of Turkey. =Under Bonar Law= Unlike many leading Conservative members of Lloyd George's Coalition Cabinet, Curzon ceased to support Lloyd George over the Chanak Crisis and had just resigned when Conservative backbenchers voted at the Carlton Club meeting to end the Coalition in October 1922. Curzon was thus able to remain Foreign Secretary when Bonar Law formed a purely Conservative ministry. In 1922‚Äì23 Curzon had to negotiate with France after French troops occupied the Ruhr to enforce the payment of German reparations; he described the French Prime Minister (and former President) Raymond Poincar√© as a \\"horrid little man\\". Curzon had expansive ambitions and was not much happier with Bonar Law, whose foreign policy was based on \\"retrenchment and withdrawal\\", than he had been with Lloyd George. However he provided invaluable insight into the Middle East and was instrumental in shaping British foreign policy in that region.Bennett, \\"Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919‚Äì22,\\" p. 477. Passed over for prime minister, 1923 Lord Curzon of Kedleston by John Singer Sargent, 1914. Royal Geographical Society On Bonar Law's retirement as prime minister in May 1923, Curzon was passed over for the job in favour of Stanley Baldwin, despite his eagerness for the job. This decision was taken on the private advice of leading members of the party including former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour. Balfour advised the monarch that in a democratic age it was inappropriate for the prime minister to be a member of the House of Lords, especially when the Labour Party, which had few peers, had become the main opposition party in the Commons. In private Balfour admitted that he was prejudiced against Curzon, whose character was objectionable to some. George V shared this prejudice. A letter purporting to detail the opinions of Bonar Law but actually written by Baldwin sympathisers was delivered to the King's Private Secretary Lord Stamfordham, though it is unclear how much impact this had in the final outcome. Curzon felt he was cheated because Lord Davidson--to whom Baldwin was loyal--and Sir Charles Waterhouse falsely claimed to Lord Stamfordham that the resigned Prime Minister Bonar Law had recommended that George V appoint Stanley Baldwin, not Curzon, as his successor. Harry Bennett says Curzon's arrogance and unpopularity probably prevented him from becoming prime minister despite his brilliance, great capacity for work, and prior accomplishments.Harry Bennett, \\"Lord Curzon of Kedleston: 'Easily misunderstood' and 'Easily misrepresented',\\" The Historian, No. 49, 1996. pp. 17-19. Winston Churchill, one of Curzon's main rivals, accurately contended that Curzon \\"sow[ed] gratitude and resentment along his path with equally lavish hands\\".Winston S. Churchill, Great Contemporaries, However, even contemporaries who envied Curzon, such as Baldwin, conceded that Curzon was, in the words of his biographer Leonard Mosley, \\"a devoted and indefatigable public servant, dedicated to the idea of Empire\\". Curzon, summoned by Stamfordham, rushed to London assuming he was to be appointed. He burst into tears when told the truth. He later ridiculed Baldwin as \\"a man of the utmost insignificance\\", although he served under Baldwin and proposed him for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Curzon remained foreign secretary under Baldwin until the government fell in January 1924. When Baldwin formed a new government in November 1924 he appointed Curzon Lord President of the Council. Curzon's rejection was a turning point in the nation's political history. Henceforth Lords were barred from leading political parties and becoming prime minister. It was now an age of democracy that made it unacceptable for the prime minister to be based in an unelected and largely powerless chamber.Chris Cooper, \\"Heir not Apparent: Douglas Hailsham, the role of the House of Lords, and the Succession to the Conservative Leadership 1928‚Äì31.\\" Parliamentary History 31.2 (2012): 206-229. Death The last photograph taken of Curzon on his way to attend a cabinet meeting (1925) In March 1925 Curzon suffered a severe haemorrhage of the bladder. Surgery was unsuccessful and he died in London on 20 March 1925 at the age of 66. His coffin, made from the same tree at Kedleston that had encased his first wife, Mary, was taken to Westminster Abbey and from there to his ancestral home in Derbyshire, where he was interred beside Mary in the family vault at All Saints Church on 26 March. In his will, proven on 22 July, Curzon bequeathed his estate to his wife and his brother Francis; his estate was valued for probate at ¬£343,279 10s. 4d. (roughly equivalent to ¬£ in ). Upon his death the Barony, Earldom and Marquessate of Curzon of Kedleston and the Earldom of Kedleston became extinct, whilst the Viscountcy and Barony of Scarsdale were inherited by a nephew. The Barony of Ravensdale was inherited by his eldest daughter Mary and is today held by his second daughter Cynthia's great-grandson, Daniel Nicholas Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale. There is now a blue plaque on the house in London where Curzon lived and died, No. 1 Carlton House Terrace, Westminster.  Titles  On his appointment as Viceroy of India in 1898, he was created Baron Curzon of Kedleston, in the County of Derby. This title was created in the Peerage of Ireland to enable him to potentially return to the House of Commons, as Irish peers did not have an automatic right to sit in the House of Lords. His was the last title to be created in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1908, he was elected a representative of the Irish peerage in the British House of Lords, from which it followed that he would be a member of the House of Lords until death; indeed, his representative peerage would continue even if (as proved to be the case) he later received a United Kingdom peerage entitling him to a seat in the House of Lords in his own right. In 1911 he was created Earl Curzon of Kedleston, Viscount Scarsdale, and Baron Ravensdale. All of these titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Upon his father's death in 1916, he also became 5th Baron Scarsdale, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The title had been created in 1761. In the 1921 Birthday Honours, he was created Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. The title became extinct upon his death in 1925, as he was survived by three daughters and no sons.  Assessment  Few statesmen have experienced such changes in fortune in both their public and their personal lives. Sir David Gilmour, 4th Baronet, concludes: > Curzon's career was an almost unparallelled blend of triumph and > disappointment. Although he was the last and in many ways the greatest of > Victorian viceroys, his term of office ended in resignation, empty of > recognition and devoid of reward.... he was unable to assert himself fully > as Foreign Secretary until the last weeks of Lloyd George's premiership. > Finally, after he had restored his reputation at Lausanne, his ultimate > ambition was thwarted by George V.David Gilmour, \\"Curzon, George Nathaniel, > Marquess Curzon of Kedleston (1859‚Äì1925)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National > Biography Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 30 > Sept 2014 Critics generally agreed that Curzon never reached the heights that his youthful talents had seemed destined to reach. This sense of opportunities missed was summed up by Winston Churchill in his book Great Contemporaries (1937): > The morning had been golden; the noontide was bronze; and the evening lead. > But all were polished till it shone after its fashion. Churchill also wrote there was certainly something lacking in Curzon: > it was certainly not information nor application, nor power of speech nor > attractiveness of manner and appearance. Everything was in his equipment. > You could unpack his knapsack and take an inventory item by item. Nothing on > the list was missing, yet somehow or other the total was > incomplete.Churchill, Great Contemporaries, Chapter on Curzon His Cabinet colleague The Earl of Crawford provided a withering personal judgment in his diary; \\"I never knew a man less loved by his colleagues and more hated by his subordinates, never a man so bereft of conscience, of charity or of gratitude. On the other hand the combination of power, of industry, and of ambition with a mean personality is almost without parallel. I never attended a funeral ceremony at which the congregation was so dry- eyed!\\" The first leader of independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, paid Curzon a surprising tribute, referring to the fact that Curzon as Viceroy exhibited real love of Indian culture and ordered a restoration project for several historic monuments, including the Taj Mahal: > After every other Viceroy has been forgotten, Curzon will be remembered > because he restored all that was beautiful in India. Legacy By special remainders, although he had no son, two of Curzon's peerages survive to the present day. His barony of Ravensdale went first to his eldest daughter, Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale, and then to his grandson Nicholas Mosley, both of whom sat in the House of Lords, while his Viscount Scarsdale title went to a nephew. His great-great-grandson Daniel Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale, is a current member of the House of Lords, having been elected as a representative hereditary peer. Curzon Hall, the home of the faculty of science at the University of Dhaka, is named after him. Lord Curzon himself inaugurated the building in 1904. Curzon Gate, a ceremonial gate, was erected by Maharaja Bijay Chand Mahatab in the heart of Burdwan town and was renamed to commemorate Lord Curzon's visit to the town in 1904, which was renamed as Bijay Toran after the independence of India in 1947. In Kolkata, which was, as Calcutta, the capital of British India during Curzon's tenure as viceroy, Curzon park was named in his honour. It has since been renamed as Surendranath Park, but the old name is still in popular use. Curzon Road, the road connecting India Gate, the memorial dedicated to the Indian fallen during the Great War of 1914‚Äì18, and Connaught Place, in New Delhi was named after him. It has since been renamed Kasturba Gandhi Marg. The apartment buildings on the same road are still named after him.

In analysis, numerical integration comprises a broad family of algorithms for calculating the numerical value of a definite integral, and by extension, the term is also sometimes used to describe the numerical solution of differential equations. This article focuses on calculation of definite integrals. The term numerical quadrature (often abbreviated to quadrature) is more or less a synonym for numerical integration, especially as applied to one-dimensional integrals. Some authors refer to numerical integration over more than one dimension as cubature; others take quadrature to include higher-dimensional integration. The basic problem in numerical integration is to compute an approximate solution to a definite integral :\\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx to a given degree of accuracy. If is a smooth function integrated over a small number of dimensions, and the domain of integration is bounded, there are many methods for approximating the integral to the desired precision.  History  The term \\"numerical integration\\" first appears in 1915 in the publication A Course in Interpolation and Numeric Integration for the Mathematical Laboratory by David Gibb. Quadrature is a historical mathematical term that means calculating area. Quadrature problems have served as one of the main sources of mathematical analysis. Mathematicians of Ancient Greece, according to the Pythagorean doctrine, understood calculation of area as the process of constructing geometrically a square having the same area (squaring). That is why the process was named quadrature. For example, a quadrature of the circle, Lune of Hippocrates, The Quadrature of the Parabola. This construction must be performed only by means of compass and straightedge. The ancient Babylonians used the trapezoidal rule to integrate the motion of Jupiter along the ecliptic. Antique method to find the Geometric mean For a quadrature of a rectangle with the sides a and b it is necessary to construct a square with the side x =\\\\sqrt {ab} (the Geometric mean of a and b). For this purpose it is possible to use the following fact: if we draw the circle with the sum of a and b as the diameter, then the height BH (from a point of their connection to crossing with a circle) equals their geometric mean. The similar geometrical construction solves a problem of a quadrature for a parallelogram and a triangle. The area of a segment of a parabola Problems of quadrature for curvilinear figures are much more difficult. The quadrature of the circle with compass and straightedge had been proved in the 19th century to be impossible. Nevertheless, for some figures (for example the Lune of Hippocrates) a quadrature can be performed. The quadratures of a sphere surface and a parabola segment done by Archimedes became the highest achievement of the antique analysis. * The area of the surface of a sphere is equal to quadruple the area of a great circle of this sphere. * The area of a segment of the parabola cut from it by a straight line is 4/3 the area of the triangle inscribed in this segment. For the proof of the results Archimedes used the Method of exhaustion of Eudoxus. In medieval Europe the quadrature meant calculation of area by any method. More often the Method of indivisibles was used; it was less rigorous, but more simple and powerful. With its help Galileo Galilei and Gilles de Roberval found the area of a cycloid arch, Gr√©goire de Saint-Vincent investigated the area under a hyperbola (Opus Geometricum, 1647), and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa, de Saint-Vincent's pupil and commentator, noted the relation of this area to logarithms. John Wallis algebrised this method: he wrote in his Arithmetica Infinitorum (1656) series that we now call the definite integral, and he calculated their values. Isaac Barrow and James Gregory made further progress: quadratures for some algebraic curves and spirals. Christiaan Huygens successfully performed a quadrature of some Solids of revolution. The quadrature of the hyperbola by Saint-Vincent and de Sarasa provided a new function, the natural logarithm, of critical importance. With the invention of integral calculus came a universal method for area calculation. In response, the term quadrature has become traditional, and instead the modern phrase \\"computation of a univariate definite integral\\" is more common. Reasons for numerical integration There are several reasons for carrying out numerical integration. Methods for one-dimensional integrals Numerical integration methods can generally be described as combining evaluations of the integrand to get an approximation to the integral. The integrand is evaluated at a finite set of points called integration points and a weighted sum of these values is used to approximate the integral. The integration points and weights depend on the specific method used and the accuracy required from the approximation. An important part of the analysis of any numerical integration method is to study the behavior of the approximation error as a function of the number of integrand evaluations. A method that yields a small error for a small number of evaluations is usually considered superior. Reducing the number of evaluations of the integrand reduces the number of arithmetic operations involved, and therefore reduces the total round-off error. Also, each evaluation takes time, and the integrand may be arbitrarily complicated. A 'brute force' kind of numerical integration can be done, if the integrand is reasonably well-behaved (i.e. piecewise continuous and of bounded variation), by evaluating the integrand with very small increments. =Quadrature rules based on interpolating functions= A large class of quadrature rules can be derived by constructing interpolating functions that are easy to integrate. Typically these interpolating functions are polynomials. In practice, since polynomials of very high degree tend to oscillate wildly, only polynomials of low degree are used, typically linear and quadratic. Illustration of the rectangle rule. The simplest method of this type is to let the interpolating function be a constant function (a polynomial of degree zero) that passes through the point \\\\left( \\\\frac{a+b}{2}, f \\\\left( \\\\frac{a+b}{2} \\\\right)\\\\right) . This is called the midpoint rule or rectangle rule :\\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\, dx \\\\approx (b-a) f\\\\left(\\\\frac{a+b}{2}\\\\right). Illustration of the trapezoidal rule. The interpolating function may be a straight line (an affine function, i.e. a polynomial of degree 1) passing through the points \\\\left( a, f(a)\\\\right) and \\\\left( b, f(b)\\\\right) . This is called the trapezoidal rule :\\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\, dx \\\\approx (b-a) \\\\left(\\\\frac{f(a) + f(b)}{2}\\\\right). Illustration of Simpson's rule. For either one of these rules, we can make a more accurate approximation by breaking up the interval [a,b] into some number n of subintervals, computing an approximation for each subinterval, then adding up all the results. This is called a composite rule, extended rule, or iterated rule. For example, the composite trapezoidal rule can be stated as : \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\, dx \\\\approx \\\\frac{b-a}{n} \\\\left( {f(a) \\\\over 2} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\\\left( f \\\\left( a+k \\\\frac{b-a}{n} \\\\right) \\\\right) + {f(b) \\\\over 2} \\\\right), where the subintervals have the form [a+k h,a+ (k+1)h] \\\\subset [a,b], with h = \\\\frac{b-a}{n} and k = 0,\\\\ldots,n-1. Here we used subintervals of the same length h but one could also use intervals of varying length \\\\left( h_k \\\\right)_k . Interpolation with polynomials evaluated at equally spaced points in [a,b] yields the Newton‚ÄìCotes formulas, of which the rectangle rule and the trapezoidal rule are examples. Simpson's rule, which is based on a polynomial of order 2, is also a Newton‚ÄìCotes formula. Quadrature rules with equally spaced points have the very convenient property of nesting. The corresponding rule with each interval subdivided includes all the current points, so those integrand values can be re-used. If we allow the intervals between interpolation points to vary, we find another group of quadrature formulas, such as the Gaussian quadrature formulas. A Gaussian quadrature rule is typically more accurate than a Newton‚ÄìCotes rule, which requires the same number of function evaluations, if the integrand is smooth (i.e., if it is sufficiently differentiable). Other quadrature methods with varying intervals include Clenshaw‚ÄìCurtis quadrature (also called Fej√©r quadrature) methods, which do nest. Gaussian quadrature rules do not nest, but the related Gauss‚ÄìKronrod quadrature formulas do. = Generalized midpoint rule formula = A generalized midpoint rule formula is given by : \\\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty{\\\\frac{{{{\\\\left({-1}\\\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\\\left({2M}\\\\right)}^{n+1}}\\\\left({n+1}\\\\right)!}}{{\\\\left.{{f^{\\\\left(n\\\\right)}}\\\\left(x\\\\right)}\\\\right}_{x=\\\\frac{M}}}}} or : \\\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=\\\\lim_{M\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\\\sum_{n=0}^N{\\\\frac{{{{\\\\left({-1}\\\\right)}^n}+1}}{{{{\\\\left({2M}\\\\right)}^{n+1}}\\\\left({n+1}\\\\right)!}}{{\\\\left.{{f^{\\\\left(n\\\\right)}}\\\\left(x\\\\right)}\\\\right}_{x=\\\\frac{M}}}}}, where f^{(n)}(x) denotes n-th derivative. For example, substituting M=1 and : f(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{1+\\\\theta^2 x^2} in the generalized midpoint rule formula, we obtain an equation of the inverse tangent : \\\\tan^{-1}(\\\\theta)=i\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(1+2i/\\\\theta\\\\right)^{2n-1}}-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\left(1-2i/\\\\theta\\\\right)^{2n-1}}\\\\right)=2\\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}{\\\\frac{1}{2n-1}\\\\frac{{{a}_{n}}\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)}{a_{n}^{2}\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)+b_{n}^{2}\\\\left(\\\\theta\\\\right)}}, where i=\\\\sqrt{-1} is imaginary unit and :\\\\begin{align} a_1(\\\\theta) &= \\\\frac{2}{\\\\theta},\\\\\\\\\\\\ b_1(\\\\theta) &= 1,\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_n(\\\\theta) &= \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4}{\\\\theta^2}\\\\right)\\\\,a_{n-1}(\\\\theta) + \\\\frac{4}{\\\\theta}\\\\,b_{n-1}(\\\\theta),\\\\\\\\\\\\ b_n(\\\\theta) &= \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4}{\\\\theta^2}\\\\right)\\\\,b_{n-1}(\\\\theta) - \\\\frac{4}{\\\\theta}\\\\,a_{n-1}(\\\\theta). \\\\end{align} Since at each odd n the numerator of the integrand becomes (-1)^n + 1 = 0 , the generalized midpoint rule formula can be reorganized as : \\\\int_0^1{f(x)dx}=2\\\\sum_{m=1}^M{\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty{\\\\frac{{{{\\\\left({2M}\\\\right)}^{2n+1}}\\\\left({2n+1}\\\\right)!}}{{\\\\left.{{f^{(2n)}}(x)}\\\\right}_{x=\\\\frac{M}}}}}\\\\,\\\\,. The following example of Mathematica code generates the plot showing difference between inverse tangent and its approximation truncated at M = 5 and N = 10 : f[theta_, x_] := theta/(1 + theta^2*x^2); aTan[theta_, M_, nMax_] := 2*Sum[(Function[x, Evaluate[D[f[theta, x], {x, 2*n} ][(m - 1/2)/ M])/((2*n + 1)!*(2*M)^(2*n + 1)), {m, 1, M}, {n, 0, nMax}]; Plot[{ArcTan[theta] - aTan[theta, 5, 10]}, {theta, -Pi, Pi}, PlotRange -> All] For a function g(t) defined over interval (a,b) , its integral is : \\\\int_a^b {g(t) dt} = \\\\int_0^{b-a} {g(\\\\tau+a) d\\\\tau}= (b-a)\\\\int_0^1 {g((b-a)x+a) dx}. Therefore, we can apply the generalized midpoint integration formula above by assuming that f(x) = (b-a)\\\\,g((b-a)x+a) . = Adaptive algorithms = If f(x) does not have many derivatives at all points, or if the derivatives become large, then Gaussian quadrature is often insufficient. In this case, an algorithm similar to the following will perform better: def calculate_definite_integral_of_f(f, initial_step_size): \\"\\"\\" This algorithm calculates the definite integral of a function from 0 to 1, adaptively, by choosing smaller steps near problematic points. \\"\\"\\" x = 0.0 h = initial_step_size accumulator = 0.0 while x < 1.0: if x + h > 1.0: h = 1.0 - x # At end of unit interval, adjust last step to end at 1. if error_too_big_in_quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x, x + h]): h = make_h_smaller(h) else: accumulator += quadrature_of_f_over_range(f, [x, x + h]) x += h if error_too_small_in_quadrature_of_over_range(f, [x, x + h]): h = make_h_larger(h) # Avoid wasting time on tiny steps. return accumulator Some details of the algorithm require careful thought. For many cases, estimating the error from quadrature over an interval for a function f(x) isn't obvious. One popular solution is to use two different rules of quadrature, and use their difference as an estimate of the error from quadrature. The other problem is deciding what \\"too large\\" or \\"very small\\" signify. A local criterion for \\"too large\\" is that the quadrature error should not be larger than t * h where t, a real number, is the tolerance we wish to set for global error. Then again, if h is already tiny, it may not be worthwhile to make it even smaller even if the quadrature error is apparently large. A global criterion is that the sum of errors on all the intervals should be less than t. This type of error analysis is usually called \\"a posteriori\\" since we compute the error after having computed the approximation. Heuristics for adaptive quadrature are discussed by Forsythe et al. (Section 5.4). = Extrapolation methods = The accuracy of a quadrature rule of the Newton- Cotes type is generally a function of the number of evaluation points. The result is usually more accurate as the number of evaluation points increases, or, equivalently, as the width of the step size between the points decreases. It is natural to ask what the result would be if the step size were allowed to approach zero. This can be answered by extrapolating the result from two or more nonzero step sizes, using series acceleration methods such as Richardson extrapolation. The extrapolation function may be a polynomial or rational function. Extrapolation methods are described in more detail by Stoer and Bulirsch (Section 3.4) and are implemented in many of the routines in the QUADPACK library. = Conservative (a priori) error estimation = Let f have a bounded first derivative over [a,b], i.e. f \\\\in C^1([a,b]). The mean value theorem for f, where x \\\\in [a,b), gives : (x - a) f'(\\\\xi_x) = f(x) - f(a), for some \\\\xi_x \\\\in (a,x] depending on x . If we integrate in x from a to b on both sides and take the absolute values, we obtain : \\\\left \\\\int_a^b f(x)\\\\, dx - (b - a) f(a) \\\\right = \\\\left \\\\int_a^b (x - a) f'(\\\\xi_x)\\\\, dx \\\\right . We can further approximate the integral on the right-hand side by bringing the absolute value into the integrand, and replacing the term in f' by an upper bound where the supremum was used to approximate. Hence, if we approximate the integral \\\\int_a^b f(x) \\\\, dx by the quadrature rule (b - a) f(a) our error is no greater than the right hand side of . We can convert this into an error analysis for the Riemann sum (*), giving an upper bound of : {n^{-1} \\\\over 2} \\\\sup_{0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 1} \\\\left f'(x) \\\\right for the error term of that particular approximation. (Note that this is precisely the error we calculated for the example f(x) = x.) Using more derivatives, and by tweaking the quadrature, we can do a similar error analysis using a Taylor series (using a partial sum with remainder term) for f. This error analysis gives a strict upper bound on the error, if the derivatives of f are available. This integration method can be combined with interval arithmetic to produce computer proofs and verified calculations. = Integrals over infinite intervals = Several methods exist for approximate integration over unbounded intervals. The standard technique involves specially derived quadrature rules, such as Gauss-Hermite quadrature for integrals on the whole real line and Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for integrals on the positive reals. Monte Carlo methods can also be used, or a change of variables to a finite interval; e.g., for the whole line one could use : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x) \\\\, dx = \\\\int_{-1}^{+1} f\\\\left( \\\\frac{t}{1-t^2} \\\\right) \\\\frac{1+t^2}{(1-t^2)^2} \\\\, dt, and for semi-infinite intervals one could use : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int_a^{\\\\infty}f(x) \\\\, dx &= \\\\int_0^1 f\\\\left(a + \\\\frac{t}{1-t}\\\\right) \\\\frac{dt}{(1-t)^2}, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^a f(x) \\\\, dx &= \\\\int_0^1 f\\\\left(a - \\\\frac{1-t}{t}\\\\right) \\\\frac{dt}{t^2}, \\\\end{align} as possible transformations.  Multidimensional integrals  The quadrature rules discussed so far are all designed to compute one-dimensional integrals. To compute integrals in multiple dimensions, one approach is to phrase the multiple integral as repeated one-dimensional integrals by applying Fubini's theorem (the tensor product rule). This approach requires the function evaluations to grow exponentially as the number of dimensions increases. Three methods are known to overcome this so-called curse of dimensionality. A great many additional techniques for forming multidimensional cubature integration rules for a variety of weighting functions are given in the monograph by Stroud. = Monte Carlo = Monte Carlo methods and quasi-Monte Carlo methods are easy to apply to multi-dimensional integrals. They may yield greater accuracy for the same number of function evaluations than repeated integrations using one- dimensional methods. A large class of useful Monte Carlo methods are the so- called Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, which include the Metropolis- Hastings algorithm and Gibbs sampling. = Sparse grids = Sparse grids were originally developed by Smolyak for the quadrature of high-dimensional functions. The method is always based on a one-dimensional quadrature rule, but performs a more sophisticated combination of univariate results. However, whereas the tensor product rule guarantees that the weights of all of the cubature points will be positive if the weights of the quadrature points were positive, Smolyak's rule does not guarantee that the weights will all be positive. = Bayesian Quadrature = Bayesian Quadrature is a statistical approach to the numerical problem of computing integrals and falls under the field of probabilistic numerics. It can provide a full handling of the uncertainty over the solution of the integral expressed as a Gaussian Process posterior variance. It is also known to provide very fast convergence rates which can be up to exponential in the number of quadrature points n.  Connection with differential equations  The problem of evaluating the integral :F(x) = \\\\int_a^x f(u)\\\\, du can be reduced to an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation by applying the first part of the fundamental theorem of calculus. By differentiating both sides of the above with respect to the argument x, it is seen that the function F satisfies : \\\\frac{d F(x)}{d x} = f(x), \\\\quad F(a) = 0. Methods developed for ordinary differential equations, such as Runge‚ÄìKutta methods, can be applied to the restated problem and thus be used to evaluate the integral. For instance, the standard fourth-order Runge‚ÄìKutta method applied to the differential equation yields Simpson's rule from above. The differential equation F'(x) = f(x) has a special form: the right-hand side contains only the independent variable (here x) and not the dependent variable (here F). This simplifies the theory and algorithms considerably. The problem of evaluating integrals is thus best studied in its own right.

He is best known for two fundamental discoveries in astronomy, the aberration of light (1725‚Äì1728), and the nutation of the Earth's axis (1728‚Äì1748). These discoveries were called \\"the most brilliant and useful of the century\\" by Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre, historian of astronomy, mathematical astronomer and director of the Paris Observatory, in his history of astronomy in the 18th century (1821), because \\"It is to these two discoveries by Bradley that we owe the exactness of modern astronomy. ... This double service assures to their discoverer the most distinguished place (after Hipparchus and Kepler) above the greatest astronomers of all ages and all countries.\\"  Biography  Bradley was born at Sherborne, near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, to William Bradley and Jane Pound in September 1692. His brother John was also an astronomer. After attending Westwood's Grammar School at Northleach in Gloucestershire, he entered Balliol College, Oxford, on 15 March 1711, and took degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts in 1714 and 1717 respectively. His early observations were made at the rectory of Wanstead in Essex, under the tutelage of James Pound, his uncle and a skilled astronomer. Bradley was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 6 November 1718. He took orders on becoming vicar of Bridstow in Herefordshire in the following year, and a small sinecure living in Wales was also procured for him by his friend Samuel Molyneux. He resigned his ecclesiastical preferments in 1721, when appointed to the Savilian chair of astronomy at Oxford, while as reader on experimental philosophy from 1729 to 1760, he delivered 79 courses of lectures at the Ashmolean Museum. In 1742, Bradley was appointed to succeed Edmond Halley as Astronomer Royal; his reputation enabled him to apply successfully for a set of instruments costing ¬£1,000; and with an 8-foot quadrant completed for him in 1750 by John Bird, he accumulated at Greenwich in ten years materials of inestimable value for the reform of astronomy. A crown pension of ¬£250 a year was conferred upon him in 1752. Bradley retired in broken health, nine years later, to the Cotswold village of Chalford in Gloucestershire. He had medical attention from a local doctor, and Daniel Lysons from Oxford. He died at Skiveralls House on 13 July 1762. He was buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity church, Minchinhampton in Gloucestershire. His wife died before him, in 1757. He was survived by one daughter. Works In 1722 Bradley measured the angular diameter of Venus with a large aerial telescope with an objective focal length of . Bradley's discovery of the aberration of light was made while attempting to detect stellar parallax. Bradley worked with Samuel Molyneux until Molyneux's death in 1728, trying to measure the parallax of Gamma Draconis. This stellar parallax ought to have shown up, if it existed at all, as a small annual cyclical motion of the apparent position of the star. However, while Bradley and Molyneux did not find the expected apparent motion due to parallax, they found instead a different and unexplained annual cyclical motion. Shortly after Molyneux's death, Bradley realised that this was caused by what is now known as the aberration of light. The basis on which Bradley distinguished the annual motion actually observed from the expected motion due to parallax, was that its annual timetable was different. Calculation showed that if there had been any appreciable motion due to parallax, then the star should have reached its most southerly apparent position in December, and its most northerly apparent position in June. What Bradley found instead was an apparent motion that reached its most southerly point in March, and its most northerly point in September; and that could not be accounted for by parallax: the cause of a motion with the pattern actually seen was at first obscure. A story has often been told, probably apocryphally, that the solution to the problem eventually occurred to Bradley while he was in a sailing boat on the River Thames. He noticed that when the boat turned about, a small flag at the top of the mast (a telltale) changed its direction, even though the wind had not changed; the only thing that had changed was the direction and speed of the boat. Bradley worked out the consequences of supposing that the direction and speed of the earth in its orbit, combined with a consistent speed of light from the star, might cause the apparent changes of stellar position that he observed. He found that this fitted the observations well, and also gave an estimate for the speed of light, and showed that the stellar parallax, if any, with extremes in June and December, was far too small to measure at the precision available to Bradley. (The smallness of any parallax, compared with expectations, also showed that the stars must be many times more distant from the Earth than anybody had previously believed.) This discovery of what became known as the aberration of light was, for all realistic purposes, conclusive evidence for the movement of the Earth, and hence for the correctness of Aristarchus' and Kepler's theories; it was announced to the Royal Society in January 1729 (Phil. Trans. xxxv. 637). The theory of the aberration also gave Bradley a means to improve on the accuracy of the previous estimate of the speed of light, which had previously been estimated by the work of Ole R√∏mer and others. The earliest observations upon which the discovery of the aberration was founded were made at Molyneux's house on Kew Green, and were continued at the house of Bradley's uncle James Pound in Wanstead, Essex. After publication of his work on the aberration, Bradley continued to observe, to develop and check his second major discovery, the nutation of the Earth's axis, but he did not announce this in print until 14 February 1748 (Phil. Trans. xlv. I), when he had tested its reality by minute observations during an entire revolution (18.6 years) of the moon's nodes. The publication of Bradley's observations was delayed by disputes about their ownership; but they were finally issued by the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in two folio volumes (1798, 1805). The insight and industry of Friedrich Bessel were, however, needed for the development of their fundamental importance.

It is composed of three sections, \\"Chaos: The Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchism\\", \\"Communiques of the Association for Ontological Anarchy\\" and \\"The Temporary Autonomous Zone\\". Themes The book describes the socio-political tactic of creating temporary spaces that elude formal structures of control. The essay uses various examples from history and philosophy, all of which suggest that the best way to create a non-hierarchical system of social relationships is to concentrate on the present and on releasing one's own mind from the controlling mechanisms that have been imposed on it. In the formation of a temporary autonomous zone, Bey argues, information becomes a key tool that sneaks into the cracks of formal procedures. A new territory of the moment is created that is on the boundary line of established regions. Any attempt at permanence that goes beyond the moment deteriorates to a structured system that inevitably stifles individual creativity. It is this chance at creativity that is real empowerment. Bey later expanded the concept beyond the \\"temporary\\", saying, \\"We've had to consider the fact that not all existing autonomous zones are 'temporary.' Some are ... more-or-less 'permanent.'\\" Hence, the concept of the permanent autonomous zone. The titular section is divided up into the following subsections: # Pirate Utopias # Waiting for the Revolution # The Psychotopology of Everyday Life # The Net and the Web # \\"Gone to Croatan\\" # Music as an Organizational Principle # The Will To Power as Disappearance # Ratholes in the Babylon of Information The ideas which inspired the \\"Gone to Croatan\\" chapter -- i.e. the disappearance of the Roanoke Colony -- were later used as the basis for the book Gone To Croatan: The Origins of North American Dropout Culture, edited by Ron Sakolsky and James Koehnline. Use in music The 1992 album Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis) by Praxis has quotes from TAZ in its liner notes. Bill Laswell produced an album with Hakim Bey reading excerpts from TAZ with music by Material featuring Wu Man, Nicky Skopelitis and Buckethead. It was released by Axiom in 1994. The six tracks were \\"Chaos\\", \\"Poetic Terrorism\\" and \\"Amour Fou\\" (all from \\"Chaos: The Broadsheets of Ontological Anarchism\\"), \\"Immediatism\\" and \\"The Tong\\" (both from the book Immediatism), and \\"Boycott Cop Culture\\" (from \\"Communiques of the Association for Ontological Anarchy\\"). Bey's line \\"art as crime; crime as art\\" from \\"Poetic Terrorism\\" was sampled by Negativland in their song \\"Downloading\\" on their album No Business. With lyrical pattern and subject matter similar to The Wild Party, the three song cycle of \\"Just the Best Party\\", \\"Go WIth It Girl\\" and \\"The Naughty Little Rat Makes New Friends\\" on The World/Inferno Friendship Society's 2002 album Just the Best Party details a story of love and loss from within a temporary autonomous zone. Frontman Jack Terricloth's vocal commitment to anarchist philosophy in the band's lyrics makes clearer the reference to Hakim Bey's concept. The title of the ninth album by the Spanish rock band Los Planetas is named after TAZ's Spanish title Zona temporalmente aut√≥noma (El Ej√©rcito Rojo - El Volc√°n M√∫sica, 2017). Implementations The concept of TAZ was put into practice on a large scale by the Cacophony Society in what it called Trips to the Zone, or Zone Trips. Its co-founder John Law, also co-founded Black Rock City, now called the Burning Man Festival. The annual Rainbow Gathering is another example, occurring every year since 1972 on public land in the United States, and having no formal organizational structure. In 2004 the 5-Day Electronic Music & Arts Festival called Mythopoeia (the making of myths), was designed and implemented as a Temporary Autonomous Zone - a fully decentralised, fully interactive event. The organisers Eamon Wyss and Brendan O‚ÄôKeeffe intentionally and successfully designed themselves out of the way, so the entire event of a thousand people ran all by itself without any central governing body at all.

Depending on taxonomic viewpoint, between 50 and 67 species of junipers are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere, from the Arctic, south to tropical Africa, from Ziarat, Pakistan, east to eastern Tibet in the Old World, and in the mountains of Central America. The highest-known juniper forest occurs at an altitude of in southeastern Tibet and the northern Himalayas, creating one of the highest tree-lines on earth. Description Cones and leaves of Juniperus communis Junipers vary in size and shape from tall trees, tall, to columnar or low-spreading shrubs with long, trailing branches. They are evergreen with needle-like and/or scale-like leaves. They can be either monoecious or dioecious. The female seed cones are very distinctive, with fleshy, fruit-like coalescing scales which fuse together to form a \\"berry\\"-like structure, long, with one to 12 unwinged, hard-shelled seeds. In some species, these \\"berries\\" are red-brown or orange, but in most they are blue; they are often aromatic and can be used as a spice. The seed maturation time varies between species from 6 to 18 months after pollination. The male cones are similar to those of other Cupressaceae, with six to 20 scales. In zones 7 through 10, junipers can bloom and release pollen several times each year. A few species of junipers bloom in autumn, while most species pollinate from early winter until late spring. Detail of Juniperus chinensis shoots, with juvenile (needle-like) leaves (left), and adult scale leaves and immature male cones (right) Many junipers (e.g. J. chinensis, J. virginiana) have two types of leaves; seedlings and some twigs of older trees have needle- like leaves long, and the leaves on mature plants are (mostly) tiny (), overlapping, and scale-like. When juvenile foliage occurs on mature plants, it is most often found on shaded shoots, with adult foliage in full sunlight. Leaves on fast-growing 'whip' shoots are often intermediate between juvenile and adult. In some species (e.g. J. communis, J. squamata), all the foliage is of the juvenile needle-like type, with no scale leaves. In some of these (e.g. J. communis), the needles are jointed at the base, while in others (e.g. J. squamata) the needles merge smoothly with the stem. The needle-leaves of junipers are hard and sharp, making the juvenile foliage very prickly to handle. This can be a valuable identification feature in seedlings, as the otherwise very similar juvenile foliage of cypresses (Cupressus, Chamaecyparis) and other related genera is soft and not prickly. Juniper is the exclusive food plant of the larvae of some moths and butterflies, including Bucculatrix inusitata, juniper carpet, Chionodes electella, Chionodes viduella, juniper pug, and pine beauty. Those of the tortrix moth Cydia duplicana feed on the bark around injuries or canker. Junipers are gymnosperms, which means they have seeds, but no flowers or fruits. Depending on the species, the seeds they produce take 1‚Äì3 years to develop. The impermeable coat of the seed keeps water from getting in and protects the embryo when being dispersed. It can also result in a long dormancy that is usually broken by physically damaging the seed coat. Dispersal can occur from being swallowed whole by frugivores and mammals. The resistance of the seed coat allows it to be passed down through the digestive system and out without being destroyed along the way. These seeds last a long time, as they can be dispersed long distances over the course of a few years. Classification Juniper needles, magnified. Left, Juniperus communis (Juniperus sect. Juniperus, needles 'jointed' at base). Right, Juniperus chinensis (Juniperus sect. Sabina, needles merging smoothly with the stem, not jointed at base) Cones and seeds The number of juniper species is in dispute, with two studies giving very different totals: Farjon (2001) accepted 52 species and Adams (2004) accepted 67 species. The junipers are divided into several sections, though (particularly among the scale-leaved species) which species belong to which sections is still far from clear, with research still ongoing.

The junipers from Lahaul valley can be found in dry, rocky locations planted in stony soils. These plants are being rapidly used up by grazing animals and the villagers. There are several important features of the leaves and wood of this plant that cause villagers to cut down these trees and make use of them. Additionally, the western juniper plants, a particular species in the juniper genus, are found in woodlands where there are large, open spaces. Junipers are known to encompass open areas so that they have more exposure to rainfall. Decreases in fires and a lack of livestock grazing are the two major causes of western juniper takeover. This invasion of junipers is driving changes in the environment. For instance, the ecosystem for other species previously living in the environment and farm animals has been compromised. When junipers increase in population, there is a noticeable decrease in woody species like mountain big sagebrush and aspen. Among the juniper trees themselves, there is a lot of competition. The cost of this is a decrease in berry production. Herbaceous cover decreases, and junipers are often mistaken for weeds. As a result, several farmers have thinned the juniper trees or removed them completely. However, this reduction did not result in any significant difference on wildlife survival. Some small mammals found it advantageous to have thinner juniper trees, while cutting down the entire tree was not favorable. Some junipers are susceptible to Gymnosporangium rust disease, and can be a serious problem for those people growing apple trees, an alternate host of the disease. Cultivation and uses Juniperus communis wood pieces, with a U.S. penny for scale, showing the narrow growth rings of the species Plymouth Gin factory, UK =Timber= Some junipers are given the common name \\"cedar,\\" including Juniperus virginiana, the \\"red cedar\\" that is used widely in cedar drawers and closets. The lack of space or a hyphen between the words \\"red\\" and \\"cedar\\" is sometimes used to indicate that this species is not a true cedar, Cedrus. Juniper in weave is a traditional cladding technique used in Northern Europe, e.g. at Havr√•, Norway. =Culinary use= Juniper berries are a spice used in a wide variety of culinary dishes and best known for the primary flavoring in gin (and responsible for gin's name, which is a shortening of the Dutch word for juniper, jenever). A juniper based spirit is made by fermenting juniper berries and water to create a \\"wine\\" that is then distilled. This is often sold as a juniper brandy in eastern Europe. Juniper berries are also used as the primary flavor in the liquor Jenever and sahti- style of beers. Juniper berry sauce is often a popular flavoring choice for quail, pheasant, veal, rabbit, venison, and other game dishes. =Essential oil= Juniper (Juniperus osteosperma and scopulorum) essential oil Juniper berries are steam distilled to produce an essential oil that may vary from colorless to yellow or pale green. Some of its chemical components are terpenoids and aromatic compounds, such as cadinene, a sesquiterpene. =Ethnic and herbal use= Most species of juniper are flexible and have a high compression strength-to-weight ratio. This has made the wood a traditional choice for the construction of hunting bows among some of the Native American cultures in the Great Basin region. These bow staves are typically backed with sinew to provide tension strength that the wood may lack. Some Indigenous peoples of the Americas use juniper in traditional medicine; for instance the Dineh, who use it for diabetes. Juniper ash has also been historically consumed as a source of calcium by the Navajo people. Juniper is traditionally used in Scottish folkloric and Gaelic Polytheist saining rites, such as those performed at Hogmanay (New Year), where the smoke of burning juniper, accompanied by traditional prayers and other customary rites, is used to cleanse, bless, and protect the household and its inhabitants. =Wood and leaves= Local people in Lahaul Valley present juniper leaves to their deities as a folk tradition. It is also useful as a folk remedy for pains and aches, as well as epilepsy and asthma. They are reported to collect large amounts of juniper leaves and wood for building and religious purposes. =Ornamental use= Juniperus √ó pfitzeriana ‚ÄòGold Coast‚Äô Junipers are among the most popular conifers to be cultivated as ornamental subjects for parks and gardens. They have been bred over many years to produce a wide range of forms, in terms of colour, shape and size. They include some of the dwarfest (miniature) cultivars. They are also used for bonsai. Some species found in cultivation include: *Juniperu chinensis *Juniperus communis *Juniperus horizontalis *Juniperus √ó pfitzeriana *Juniperus procumbens *Juniperus rigida *Juniperus scapulorum *Juniperus squamata Allergenic potential In drier areas, juniper pollen easily becomes airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs. This pollen can also irritate the skin and cause contact dermatitis. Cross-allergenic reactions are common between juniper pollen and the pollen of all species of cypress. Monoecious juniper plants are highly allergenic, with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 9 out of 10. Completely male juniper plants have an OPALS rating of 10, and release abundant amounts of pollen. Conversely, all-female juniper plants have an OPALS rating of 1, and are considered \\"allergy-fighting\\". ReferencesFurther reading *Adams, R. P. (2004). Junipers of the World: The genus Juniperus.

He is credited along with Warren Hastings for laying the foundation of the British Empire in India. He began as a writer for the East India Company (EIC) who established the military and political supremacy of the EIC by securing a decisive victory in Bengal. In return for supporting the Nawab of Bengal Mir Jafar on the throne, Clive was granted a jaghire of ¬£30,000 (¬£9 million in 2009) per year which was the rent the EIC would otherwise pay to the Nawab for their tax farming concession, when he left India he had a fortune of ¬£180,000 (¬£54 million in 2009) which he remitted through the Dutch East India Company.Clive of India, by John Watney, published 1974, p.149 Blocking impending French mastery of India, and eventual British expulsion from the continent, Clive improvised a military expedition that ultimately enabled the EIC to adopt the French strategy of indirect rule via puppet government. Hired by the EIC to return a second time to India, Clive conspired to secure the Company's trade interests by overthrowing the ruler of Bengal, the richest state in India. Back in England, he used his treasure from India to secure an Irish barony from the then Whig PM, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, and a seat for himself in Parliament, via Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis, representing the Whigs in Shrewsbury, Shropshire (1761‚Äì1774), as he had previously in Mitchell, Cornwall (1754‚Äì1755). Clive has become one of the most controversial figures in British colonial history, being labelled an \\"unstable sociopath\\" by renowned historian William Dalrymple for his brutal atrocities against native populations and his policies during his management of the EIC that contributed to the Great Bengal famine of 1770. His achievements included checking French Imperial ambitions on the Coromandel Coast and establishing EIC control over Bengal, thereby taking the first step towards establishing the British Raj, though he worked only as an agent of the East India Company, not the British government. He was vilified by his political rivals in Britain, and put on trial before Parliament.Charles Messenger, ed., Reader's Guide to Military History (2001) pp 112‚Äì13. Early life Robert Clive was born at Styche, the Clive family estate, near Market Drayton in Shropshire, on 29 September 1725 to Richard Clive and Rebecca (n√©e Gaskell) Clive.Arbuthnot, p. 1 The family had held the small estate since the time of Henry VII and had a lengthy history of public service: members of the family included an Irish chancellor of the exchequer under Henry VIII, and a member of the Long Parliament. Robert's father, who supplemented the estate's modest income by practising as a lawyer, also served in Parliament for many years, representing Montgomeryshire. Robert was their eldest son of thirteen children; he had seven sisters and five brothers, six of whom died in infancy.Harvey (1998), p. 11 St. Mary's in Market Drayton, whose tower Clive is reputed to have climbed Clive's father was known to have a temper, which the boy apparently inherited. For reasons that are unknown, Clive was sent to live with his mother's sister in Manchester while still a toddler. Biographer Robert Harvey suggests that this move was made because Clive's father was busy in London trying to provide for the family.Harvey (1998), p. 10 Daniel Bayley, the sister's husband, reported that the boy was \\"out of measure addicted to fighting\\".Arbuthnot, p. 2 He was a regular troublemaker in the schools he was sent to. When he was older he and a gang of teenagers established a protection racket that vandalised the shops of uncooperative merchants in Market Drayton. Clive also exhibited fearlessness at an early age. He is reputed to have climbed the tower of St Mary's Parish Church in Market Drayton and perched on a gargoyle, frightening those down below.Treasure, p. 196 When Clive was nine his aunt died, and, after a brief stint in his father's cramped London quarters, he returned to Shropshire. There he attended the Market Drayton Grammar School, where his unruly behaviour (and an improvement in the family's fortunes) prompted his father to send him to Merchant Taylors' School in London. His bad behaviour continued, and he was then sent to a trade school in Hertfordshire to complete a basic education. Despite his early lack of scholarship, in his later years he devoted himself to improving his education. He eventually developed a distinctive writing style, and a speech in the House of Commons was described by William Pitt as the most eloquent he had ever heard. First journey to India (1744‚Äì1753) Clive House at Fort St. George, Chennai Plaque at Clive House In 1744 Clive's father acquired for him a position as a \\"factor\\" or company agent in the service of the East India Company, and Clive set sail for India. After running aground on the coast of Brazil, his ship was detained for nine months while repairs were completed. This enabled him to learn some Portuguese,Harvey (1998), pp. 18‚Äì21 one of the several languages then in use in south India because of the Portuguese centre at Goa. At this time the East India Company had a small settlement at Fort St. George near the village of Madraspatnam, later Madras, now the major Indian metropolis of Chennai,Harvey (1998), pp. 23‚Äì24 in addition to others at Calcutta, Bombay, and Cuddalore.Harvey (1998), p. 30 Clive arrived at Fort St. George in June 1744, and spent the next two years working as little more than a glorified assistant shopkeeper, tallying books and arguing with suppliers of the East India Company over the quality and quantity of their wares. He was given access to the governor's library, where he became a prolific reader.Harvey (1998), pp. 24‚Äì29 Political situation in south India The India Clive arrived in was divided into a number of successor states to the Mughal Empire. Over the forty years since the death of the Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, the power of the emperor had gradually fallen into the hands of his provincial viceroys or Subahdars. The dominant rulers on the Coromandel Coast were the Nizam of Hyderabad, Asaf Jah I, and the Nawab of the Carnatic, Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan. The nawab nominally owed fealty to the nizam, but in many respects acted independently. Fort St. George and the French trading post at Pondicherry were both located in the nawab's territory. The relationship between the Europeans in India was influenced by a series of wars and treaties in Europe, and by competing commercial rivalry for trade on the subcontinent. Through the 17th and early 18th centuries, the French, Dutch, Portuguese, and British had vied for control of various trading posts, and for trading rights and favour with local Indian rulers. The European merchant companies raised bodies of troops to protect their commercial interests and latterly to influence local politics to their advantage. Military power was rapidly becoming as important as commercial acumen in securing India's valuable trade, and increasingly it was used to appropriate territory and to collect land revenue.Harvey (1998), pp. 29‚Äì30 First Carnatic War Portrait by Charles Clive, c. 1764 In 1720 France effectively nationalized the French East India Company, and began using it to expand its imperial interests. This became a source of conflict with the British in India with the entry of Britain into the War of the Austrian Succession in 1744. The Indian theatre of the conflict is also known as the First Carnatic War, referring to the Carnatic region on the southeast coast of India. Hostilities in India began with a British naval attack on a French fleet in 1745, which led the French Governor-General Dupleix to request additional forces.Harvey (1998), p. 31 On 4 September 1746, Madras was attacked by French forces led by La Bourdonnais. After several days of bombardment the British surrendered and the French entered the city. The British leadership was taken prisoner and sent to Pondicherry. It was originally agreed that the town would be restored to the British after negotiation but this was opposed by Dupleix, who sought to annex Madras to French holdings.Harvey (1998), pp. 31‚Äì34 The remaining British residents were asked to take an oath promising not to take up arms against the French; Clive and a handful of others refused, and were kept under weak guard as the French prepared to destroy the fort. Disguising themselves as natives, Clive and three others eluded their inattentive sentry, slipped out of the fort, and made their way to Fort St. David (the British post at Cuddalore), some to the south.Harvey (1998), pp. 35‚Äì36 Upon his arrival, Clive decided to enlist in the Company army rather than remain idle; in the hierarchy of the Company, this was seen as a step down.Harvey (1998), p. 39 Clive was, however, recognized for his contribution in the defence of Fort St. David, where the French assault on 11 March 1747 was repulsed with the assistance of the Nawab of the Carnatic, and was given a commission as ensign.Harvey (1998), p. 41 In the conflict, Clive's bravery came to the attention of Major Stringer Lawrence, who arrived in 1748 to take command of the British troops at Fort St. David.Harvey (1998), p. 41 During the 1748 Siege of Pondicherry Clive distinguished himself in successfully defending a trench against a French sortie: one witness of the action wrote Clive's \\"platoon, animated by his exhortation, fired again with new courage and great vivacity upon the enemy.\\"Harvey (1998), p. 42 The siege was lifted in October 1748 with the arrival of the monsoons, but the war came to a conclusion with the arrival in December of news of the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle. Madras was returned to the British as part of the peace agreement in early 1749. Tanjore expedition The end of the war between France and Britain did not, however, end hostilities in India. Even before news of the peace arrived in India, the British had sent an expedition to Tanjore on behalf of a claimant to its throne. This expedition, on which Clive, now promoted to lieutenant, served as a volunteer, was a disastrous failure. Monsoons ravaged the land forces, and the local support claimed by their client was not in evidence. The ignominious retreat of the British force (which lost its baggage train to the pursuing Tanjorean army while crossing a swollen river) was a blow to the British reputation.Harvey (1998), p. 46 Major Lawrence, seeking to recover British prestige, led the entire Madras garrison to Tanjore in response. At the fort of Devikottai on the Coleroon River the British force was confronted by the much larger Tanjorean army. Lawrence gave Clive command of 30 British soldiers and 700 sepoys, with orders to lead the assault on the fort. Clive led this force rapidly across the river and toward the fort, where the small British unit became separated from the sepoys and were enveloped by the Tanjorean cavalry. Clive was nearly cut down and the beachhead almost lost before reinforcements sent by Lawrence arrived to save the day. The daring move by Clive had an important consequence: the Tanjoreans abandoned the fort, which the British triumphantly occupied. The success prompted the Tanjorean rajah to open peace talks, which resulted in the British being awarded Devikottai and the costs of their expedition, and the British client was awarded a pension in exchange for renouncing his claim. Lawrence wrote of Clive's action that \\"he behaved in courage and in judgment much beyond what could be expected from his years.\\"Harvey (1998), pp. 46‚Äì47 On the expedition's return the process of restoring Madras was completed. Company officials, concerned about the cost of the military, slashed its size, denying Clive a promotion to captain in the process. Lawrence procured for Clive a position as the commissary at Fort St. George, a potentially lucrative posting (its pay included commissions on all supply contracts).Harvey (1998), pp. 47‚Äì48 Second Carnatic War The death of Asaf Jah I, the Nizam of Hyderabad, in 1748 sparked a struggle to succeed him that is known as the Second Carnatic War, which was also furthered by the expansionist interests of French Governor-General Dupleix. Dupleix had grasped from the first war that small numbers of disciplined European forces (and well-trained sepoys) could be used to tip balances of power between competing interests, and used this idea to greatly expand French influence in southern India. For many years he had been working to negotiate the release of Chanda Sahib, a longtime French ally who had at one time occupied the throne of Tanjore, and sought for himself the throne of the Carnatic. Chanda Sahib had been imprisoned by the Marathas in 1740; by 1748 he had been released from custody and was building an army at Satara. Upon the death of Asaf Jah I, his son, Nasir Jung, seized the throne of Hyderabad, although Asaf Jah had designated as his successor his grandson, Muzaffar Jung. The grandson, who was ruler of Bijapur, fled west to join Chanda Sahib, whose army was also reinforced by French troops sent by Dupleix. These forces met those of Anwaruddin Mohammed Khan in the Battle of Ambur in August 1749; Anwaruddin was slain, and Chanda Sahib victorious entered the Carnatic capital, Arcot. Anwaruddin's son, Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah, fled to Trichinopoly where he sought the protection and assistance of the British. In thanks for French assistance, the victors awarded them a number of villages, including territory nominally under British sway near Cuddalore and Madras. The British began sending additional arms to Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah and sought to bring Nasir Jung into the fray to oppose Chanda Sahib. Nasir Jung came south to Gingee in 1750, where he requested and received a detachment of British troops. Chanda Sahib's forces advanced to meet them, but retreated after a brief long-range cannonade. Nasir Jung pursued, and was able to capture Arcot and his nephew, Muzaffar Jung. Following a series of fruitless negotiations and intrigues, Nasir Jung was assassinated by a rebellious soldier. This made Muzaffar Jung nizam and confirmed Chanda Sahib as nawab of the Carnatic, both with French support. Dupleix was rewarded for French assistance with titled nobility and rule of the nizam's territories south of the Kistna River. His territories were \\"said to yield an annual revenue of over 350,000 rupees\\".Keay, John, The Honourable Company‚ÄîA History of the English East India Company, HarperCollins, London, 1991, p. 289. Robert Clive was not in southern India for many of these events. In 1750 Clive was afflicted with some sort of nervous disorder, and was sent north to Bengal to recuperate. It was there that he met and befriended Robert Orme, who became his principal chronicler and biographer. Clive returned to Madras in 1751. Siege of Arcot Clive at the siege of Arcot (1751) In the summer of 1751, Chanda Sahib left Arcot to besiege Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah at Trichinopoly. This placed the British at Madras in a precarious position, since the latter was the last of their major allies in the area. The British company's military was also in some disarray, as Stringer Lawrence had returned to England in 1750 over a pay dispute, and much of the company was apathetic about the dangers the expanding French influence and declining British influence posed. The weakness of the British military command was exposed when a force was sent from Madras to support Muhammed Ali at Trichinopoly, but its commander, a Swiss mercenary, refused to attack an outpost at Valikondapuram. Clive, who accompanied the force as commissary, was outraged at the decision to abandon the siege. He rode to Cuddalore, and offered his services to lead an attack on Arcot if he was given a captain's commission, arguing this would force Chanda Sahib to either abandon the siege of Trichinopoly or significantly reduce the force there. Madras and Fort St. David could supply him with only 200 Europeans, 300 sepoys, and three small cannons; furthermore, of the eight officers who led them, four were civilians like Clive, and six had never been in action. Clive, hoping to surprise the small garrison at Arcot, made a series of forced marches, including some under extremely rainy conditions. Although he did fail to achieve surprise, the garrison, hearing of the march being made under such arduous conditions, opted to abandon the fort and town; Clive occupied Arcot without firing a shot. The fort was a rambling structure with a dilapidated wall a mile long (too long for his small force to effectively man), and it was surrounded by the densely packed housing of the town. Its moat was shallow or dry, and some of its towers were insufficiently strong to use as artillery mounts. Clive did the best he could to prepare for the onslaught he expected. He made a foray against the fort's former garrison, encamped a few miles away, which had no significant effect. When the former garrison was reinforced by 2,000 men Chanda Sahib sent from Trichinopoly it reoccupied the town on 15 September. That night Clive led most of his force out of the fort and launched a surprise attack on the besiegers. Because of the darkness, the besiegers had no idea how large Clive's force was, and they fled in panic. The next day Clive learned that heavy guns he had requested from Madras were approaching, so he sent most of his garrison out to escort them into the fort. That night the besiegers, who had spotted the movement, launched an attack on the fort. With only 70 men in the fort, Clive once again was able to disguise his small numbers, and sowed sufficient confusion against his enemies that multiple assaults against the fort were successfully repulsed. That morning the guns arrived, and Chanda Sahib's men again retreated. Over the next week Clive and his men worked feverishly to improve the defences, aware that another 4,000 men, led by Chanda Sahib's son Raza Sahib and accompanied by a small contingent of French troops, was on its way. (Most of these troops came from Pondicherry, not Trichinopoly, and thus did not have the effect Clive desired of raising that siege.) Clive was forced to reduce his garrison to about 300 men, sending the rest of his force to Madras in case the enemy army decided to go there instead. Raza Sahib arrived at Arcot, and on 23 September occupied the town. That night Clive launched a daring attack against the French artillery, seeking to capture their guns. The attack very nearly succeeded in its object, but was reversed when enemy sniper fire tore into the small British force. Clive himself was targeted on more than one occasion; one man pulled him down and was shot dead. The affair was a serious blow: 15 of Clive's men were killed, and another 15 wounded. Over the next month the besiegers slowly tightened their grips on the fort. Clive's men were subjected to frequent sniper attacks and disease, lowering the garrison size to 200. He was heartened to learn that some 6,000 Maratha forces had been convinced to come to his relief, but that they were awaiting payment before proceeding. The approach of this force prompted Raza Sahib to demand Clive's surrender; Clive's response was an immediate rejection, and he further insulted Raza Sahib by suggesting that he should reconsider sending his rabble of troops against a British-held position. The siege finally reached critical when Raza Sahib launched an all-out assault against the fort on 14 November. Clive's small force maintained its composure, and established killing fields outside the walls of the fort where the attackers sought to gain entry. Several hundred attackers were killed and many more wounded, while Clive's small force suffered only four British and two sepoy casualties. The historian Thomas Babington Macaulay wrote a century later of the siege: > ... the commander who had to conduct the defence ... was a young man of five > and twenty, who had been bred as a book-keeper ... Clive ... had made his > arrangements, and, exhausted by fatigue, had thrown himself on his bed. He > was awakened by the alarm, and was instantly at his post ... After three > desperate onsets, the besiegers retired behind the ditch. The struggle > lasted about an hour ... the garrison lost only five or six men.Thomas > Babington Macaulay, \\"Lord Clive,\\" Essays (London), 1891, pp.511‚Äì13 (First > published in the Edinburgh Review, January 1840). His conduct during the siege made Clive famous in Europe. The Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder described Clive, who had received no formal military training whatsoever, as the \\"heaven-born general\\", endorsing the generous appreciation of his early commander, Major Lawrence. The Court of Directors of the East India Company voted him a sword worth ¬£700, which he refused to receive unless Lawrence was similarly honoured. Clive and Major Lawrence were able to bring the campaign to a successful conclusion. In 1754, the first of the provisional Carnatic treaties was signed between Thomas Saunders, the Company president at Madras, and Charles Godeheu, the French commander who displaced Dupleix. Mohammed Ali Khan Wallajah was recognized as Nawab, and both nations agreed to equalize their possessions. When war again broke out in 1756, during Clive's absence in Bengal, the French obtained successes in the northern districts, and it was Mohammed Ali Khan Wallajah's efforts which drove them from their settlements. The Treaty of Paris (1763) formally confirmed Mohammed Ali Khan Wallajah as Nawab of the Carnatic. It was a result of this action and the increased British influence that in 1765 a firman (decree) came from the Emperor of Delhi, recognizing the British possessions in southern India. Clive left Madras for home, after ten years' absence, early in 1753, but not before marrying Margaret Maskelyne, the sister of his friend Nevil Maskelyne who was afterwards well known as Astronomer Royal. Clive also briefly sat as Member of Parliament for the Cornwall rotten borough of St Michael's, which then returned two Members, from 1754 to 1755. He and his colleague, John Stephenson were later unseated by petition of their defeated opponents, Richard Hussey and Simon Luttrell. Second journey to India (1755‚Äì1760) In July 1755, Clive returned to India to act as deputy governor of Fort St. David at Cuddalore. He arrived after having lost a considerable fortune en route, as the Doddington, the lead ship of his convoy, was wrecked near Port Elizabeth, losing a chest of gold coins belonging to Clive worth ¬£33,000 (¬£9.9 million in 2009). Nearly 250 years later in 1998, illegally salvaged coins from Clive's treasure chest were offered for sale, and in 2002 a portion of the coins were given to the South African government after protracted legal wrangling. Clive, now promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the British Army, took part in the capture of the fortress of Gheriah, a stronghold of the Maratha Admiral Tuloji Angre. The action was led by Admiral James Watson and the British had several ships available, some Royal troops and some Maratha allies. The overwhelming strength of the joint British and Maratha forces ensured that the battle was won with few losses. A fleet surgeon, Edward Ives, noted that Clive refused to take any part of the treasure divided among the victorious forces as was custom at the time.Keay, John, The Honourable Company‚ÄîA History of the English East India Company, HarperCollins, London, 1991, p. 269. Fall and recapture of Calcutta (1756‚Äì57) Following this action Clive headed to his post at Fort St. David and it was there he received news of twin disasters for the British. Early in 1756, Siraj Ud Daulah had succeeded his grandfather Alivardi Khan as Nawab of Bengal. In June, Clive received news that the new Nawab had attacked the British at Kasimbazar and shortly afterwards on 20 June he had taken the fort at Calcutta. The losses to the Company because of the fall of Calcutta were estimated by investors at ¬£2,000,000 (¬£0.6 billion in 2009). Those British who were captured were placed in a punishment cell which became infamous as the Black Hole of Calcutta. In stifling summer heat, it was reported that 43 of the 64 prisoners died as a result of suffocation or heat strokeD. L. Prior, Holwell's biographer in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, reports figures of 64 prisoners and 21 survivors.. While the Black Hole became infamous in Britain, it is debatable whether the Nawab was aware of the incident.H.E. Busteed, Echoes from Old Calcutta (Calcutta), 1908, pp.30‚Äì56. By Christmas 1756, as no response had been received to diplomatic letters to the Nawab, Admiral Charles Watson and Clive were dispatched to attack the Nawab's army and remove him from Calcutta by force. Their first target was the fortress of Baj-Baj which Clive approached by land while Admiral Watson bombarded it from the sea. The fortress was quickly taken with minimal British casualties. Shortly afterwards, on 2 January 1757, Calcutta itself was taken with similar ease. Approximately a month later, on 3 February 1757, Clive encountered the army of the Nawab itself. For two days, the army marched past Clive's camp to take up a position east of Calcutta. Sir Eyre Coote, serving in the British forces, estimated the enemy's strength as 40,000 cavalry, 60,000 infantry and thirty cannon. Even allowing for overestimation this was considerably more than Clive's force of approximately 540 British infantry, 600 Royal Navy sailors, 800 local sepoys, fourteen field guns and no cavalry. The British forces attacked the Nawab's camp during the early morning hours of 5 February 1757. In this battle, unofficially called the 'Calcutta Gauntlet', Clive marched his small force through the entire Nawab's camp, despite being under heavy fire from all sides. By noon, Clive's force broke through the besieging camp and arrived safely at Fort William. During the assault, around one tenth of the British attackers became casualties. (Clive reported his losses at 57 killed and 137 wounded.) While technically not a victory in military terms, the sudden British assault intimidated the Nawab. He sought to make terms with Clive, and surrendered control of Calcutta on 9 February, promising to compensate the East India Company for damages suffered and to restore its privileges. War with Siraj Ud Daulah \\"9 (Plassey) Battery Royal Artillery\\" of the British Military. As Britain and France were once more at war, Clive sent the fleet up the river against the French colony of Chandannagar, while he besieged it by land. There was a strong incentive to capture the colony, as capture of a previous French settlement near Pondicherry had yielded the combined forces prizes valued at ¬£130,000 (¬£39 million in 2009). After consenting to the siege, the Nawab unsuccessfully sought to assist the French. Some officials of the Nawab's court formed a confederacy to depose him. Jafar Ali Khan, also known as Mir Jafar, the Nawab's commander-in-chief, led the conspirators. With Admiral Watson, Governor Drake and Mr. Watts, Clive made a gentlemen's agreement in which it was agreed to give the office of viceroy of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha to Mir Jafar, who was to pay ¬£1,000,000 (¬£0.3 billion in 2009) to the Company for its losses in Calcutta and the cost of its troops, ¬£500,000 (¬£150 million in 2009) to the British inhabitants of Calcutta, ¬£200,000 (¬£60 million in 2009) to the native inhabitants, and ¬£70,000 (¬£21 million in 2009) to its Armenian merchants. Clive employed Umichand, a rich Bengali trader, as an agent between Mir Jafar and the British officials. Umichand threatened to betray Clive unless he was guaranteed, in the agreement itself, ¬£300,000 (¬£90 million in 2009). To dupe him a second fictitious agreement was shown to him with a clause to this effect. Admiral Watson refused to sign it. Clive deposed later to the House of Commons that, \\"to the best of his remembrance, he gave the gentleman who carried it leave to sign his name upon it; his lordship never made any secret of it; he thinks it warrantable in such a case, and would do it again a hundred times; he had no interested motive in doing it, and did it with a design of disappointing the expectations of a rapacious man.\\" It is nevertheless cited as an example of Clive's unscrupulousness. =Plassey= Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive of Plassey, meeting with Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, by Francis Hayman. National Portrait Gallery, London. The whole hot season of 1757 was spent in negotiations with the Nawab of Bengal. In the middle of June Clive began his march from Chandannagar, with the British in boats and the sepoys along the right bank of the Hooghly River. During the rainy season, the Hooghly is fed by the overflow of the Ganges to the north through three streams, which in the hot months are nearly dry. On the left bank of the Bhagirathi, the most westerly of these, above Chandernagore, stands Murshidabad, the capital of the Mughal viceroys of Bengal. Some miles farther down is the field of Plassey, then an extensive grove of mango trees. On 21 June 1757, Clive arrived on the bank opposite Plassey, in the midst of the first outburst of monsoon rain. His whole army amounted to 1,100 Europeans and 2,100 sepoy troops, with nine field-pieces. The Nawab had drawn up 18,000 horse, 50,000-foot and 53 pieces of heavy ordnance, served by French artillerymen. For once in his career Clive hesitated, and called a council of sixteen officers to decide, as he put it, \\"whether in our present situation, without assistance, and on our own bottom, it would be prudent to attack the Nawab, or whether we should wait till joined by some country (Indian) power.\\" Clive himself headed the nine who voted for delay; Major Eyre Coote led the seven who counselled immediate attack. But, either because his daring asserted itself, or because of a letter received from Mir Jafar, Clive was the first to change his mind and to communicate with Major Eyre Coote. One tradition, followed by Macaulay, represents him as spending an hour in thought under the shade of some trees, while he resolved the issues of what was to prove one of the decisive battles of the world. Another, turned into verse by Sir Alfred Lyall, pictures his resolution as the result of a dream. However that may be, he did well as a soldier to trust to the dash and even rashness that had gained Arcot and triumphed at Calcutta since retreat, or even delay, might have resulted in defeat. After heavy rain, Clive's 3,200 men and the nine guns crossed the river and took possession of the grove and its tanks of water, while Clive established his headquarters in a hunting lodge. On 23 June, the engagement took place and lasted the whole day, during which remarkably little actual fighting took place. Gunpowder for the cannons of the Nawab were not well protected from rain. That impaired those cannons. Except for the 40 Frenchmen and the guns they worked, the Indian side could do little to reply to the British cannonade (after a spell of rain), which, with the 39th Regiment, scattered the host, inflicting on it a loss of 500 men. Clive had already made a secret agreement with aristocrats in Bengal, including Jagat Seth and Mir Jafar. Clive restrained Major Kilpatrick, for he trusted to Mir Jafar's abstinence, if not desertion to his ranks, and knew the importance of sparing his own small force. He was fully justified in his confidence in Mir Jafar's treachery to his master, for he led a large portion of the Nawab's army away from the battlefield, ensuring his defeat. Clive lost hardly any European troops; in all 22 sepoys were killed and 50 wounded. It is curious in many ways that Clive is now best-remembered for this battle, which was essentially won by suborning the opposition rather than through fighting or brilliant military tactics. Whilst it established British military supremacy in Bengal, it did not secure the East India Company's control over Upper India, as is sometimes claimed. That would come only seven years later in 1764 at the Battle of Buxar, where Sir Hector Munro defeated the combined forces of the Mughal Emperor and the Nawab of Awadh in a much more closely fought encounter. Siraj Ud Daulah fled from the field on a camel, securing what wealth he could. He was soon captured by Mir Jafar's forces and later executed by the assassin Mohammadi Beg. Clive entered Murshidabad and established Mir Jafar as Nawab, the price which had been agreed beforehand for his treachery. Clive was taken through the treasury, amid ¬£1,500,000 (¬£450 million in 2009) sterling's worth of rupees, gold and silver plate, jewels and rich goods, and besought to ask what he would. Clive took ¬£160,000 (¬£48 million in 2009), a vast fortune for the day, while ¬£500,000 (¬£150 million in 2009) was distributed among the army and navy of the East India Company, and provided gifts of ¬£24,000 (¬£7.2 million in 2009) to each member of the company's committee, as well as the public compensation stipulated for in the treaty. In this extraction of wealth Clive followed a usage fully recognized by the company, although this was the source of future corruption which Clive was later sent to India again to correct. The company itself acquired revenue of ¬£100,000 (¬£30 million in 2009) a year, and a contribution towards its losses and military expenditure of ¬£1,500,000 sterling (¬£450 million sterling in 2009). Mir Jafar further discharged his debt to Clive by afterwards presenting him with the quit-rent of the company's lands in and around Calcutta, amounting to an annuity of ¬£27,000 (¬£8.1 million in 2009) for life, and leaving him by will the sum of ¬£70,000 (¬£21 million in 2009), which Clive devoted to the army. Further campaigns=Battle of Condore= While busy with the civil administration, Clive continued to follow up his military success. He sent Major Coote in pursuit of the French almost as far as Benares. He dispatched Colonel Forde to Vizagapatam and the northern districts of Madras, where Forde won the Battle of Condore (1758), pronounced by Broome \\"one of the most brilliant actions on military record\\". =Mughals= The Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II, as a pensioner of the British East India Company, 1781. Clive came into direct contact with the Mughal himself, for the first time, a meeting which would prove beneficial in his later career. Prince Ali Gauhar escaped from Delhi after his father, the Mughal Emperor Alamgir II, had been murdered by the usurping Vizier Imad-ul- Mulk and his Maratha associate Sadashivrao Bhau. Prince Ali Gauhar was welcomed and protected by Shuja-ud-Daula, the Nawab of Awadh. In 1760, after gaining control over Bihar, Odisha and some parts of the Bengal, Ali Gauhar and his Mughal Army of 30,000 intended to overthrow Mir Jafar and the Company in order to reconquer the riches of the eastern Subahs for the Mughal Empire. Ali Gauhar was accompanied by Muhammad Quli Khan, Hidayat Ali, Mir Afzal, Kadim Husein and Ghulam Husain Tabatabai. Their forces were reinforced by the forces of Shuja-ud-Daula and Najib-ud-Daula. The Mughals were also joined by Jean Law and 200 Frenchmen, and waged a campaign against the British during the Seven Years' War. Prince Ali Gauhar successfully advanced as far as Patna, which he later besieged with a combined army of over 40,000 in order to capture or kill Ramnarian, a sworn enemy of the Mughals. Mir Jafar was terrified at the near demise of his cohort and sent his own son Miran to relieve Ramnarian and retake Patna. Mir Jafar also implored the aid of Robert Clive, but it was Major John Caillaud, who defeated and dispersed Prince Ali Gauhar's army. =Dutch aggression= While Clive was preoccupied with fighting the French, the Dutch directors of the outpost at Chinsurah, not far from Chandernagore, seeing an opportunity to expand their influence, agreed to send additional troops to Chinsurah. Despite Britain and the Dutch Republic not formally being at war, a Dutch fleet of seven ships, containing more than fifteen hundred European and Malay troops, came from Batavia and arrived at the mouth of the Hooghly River in October 1759, while Mir Jafar, the Nawab of Bengal, was meeting with Clive in Calcutta. They met a mixed force of British and local troops at Chinsurah, just outside Calcutta. The British, under Colonel Francis Forde, defeated the Dutch in the Battle of Chinsurah, forcing them to withdraw. The British engaged and defeated the ships the Dutch used to deliver the troops in a separate naval battle on 24 November. Thus Clive avenged the massacre of Amboyna ‚Äì the occasion when he wrote his famous letter; \\"Dear Forde, fight them immediately; I will send you the order of council to-morrow\\". Meanwhile, Clive improved the organization and drill of the sepoy army, after a European model, and enlisted into it many Muslims from upper regions of the Mughal Empire. He re-fortified Calcutta. In 1760, after four years of hard labour, his health gave way and he returned to England. \\"It appeared\\", wrote a contemporary on the spot, \\"as if the soul was departing from the Government of Bengal\\". He had been formally made Governor of Bengal by the Court of Directors at a time when his nominal superiors in Madras sought to recall him to their help there. But he had discerned the importance of the province even during his first visit to its rich delta, mighty rivers and teeming population. Clive selected some able subordinates, notably a young Warren Hastings, who, a year after Plassey, was made Resident at the Nawab's court. The long-term outcome of Plassey was to place a very heavy revenue burden upon Bengal. The company sought to extract the maximum revenue possible from the peasantry to fund military campaigns, and corruption was widespread amongst its officials. Mir Jafar was compelled to engage in extortion on a vast scale in order to replenish his treasury, which had been emptied by the company's demand for an indemnity of 2.8 crores of rupees (¬£3 million)., 144. Return to Great Britain In 1760, the 35-year-old Clive returned to Great Britain with a fortune of at least ¬£300,000 (¬£90 million in 2009) and the quit-rent of ¬£27,000 (¬£8.1 million in 2009) a year. He financially supported his parents and sisters, while also providing Major Lawrence, the commanding officer who had early encouraged his military genius, with a stipend of ¬£500 (¬£1.5 lacs in 2009) a year. In the five years of his conquests and administration in Bengal, the young man had crowded together a succession of exploits that led Lord Macaulay, in what that historian termed his \\"flashy\\" essay on the subject, to compare him to Napoleon Bonaparte, declaring that \\"[Clive] gave peace, security, prosperity and such liberty as the case allowed of to millions of Indians, who had for centuries been the prey of oppression, while Napoleon's career of conquest was inspired only by personal ambition, and the absolutism he established vanished with his fall.\\" Macaulay's ringing endorsement of Clive seems more controversial today, as some would argue that Clive's ambition and desire for personal gain set the tone for the administration of Bengal until the Permanent Settlement 30 years later. The immediate consequence of Clive's victory at Plassey was an increase in the revenue demand on Bengal by at least 20%, much of which was appropriated by Zamindars and corrupt Company Officials, which led to considerable hardship for the rural population, particularly during the famine of 1770. During the three years that Clive remained in Great Britain, he sought a political position, chiefly that he might influence the course of events in India, which he had left full of promise. He had been well received at court, had been made Baron Clive of Plassey, County Clare, had bought estates, and had a few friends as well as himself returned to the House of Commons. Clive was MP for Shrewsbury from 1761 until his death. He was allowed to sit in the Commons because his peerage was Irish. He was also elected Mayor of Shrewsbury for 1762‚Äì63. The non-graduate Clive received an honorary degree as DCL from Oxford University in 1760, and in 1764 he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath. Clive set himself to reform the home system of the East India Company, and began a bitter dispute with the chairman of the Court of Directors, Laurence Sulivan, whom he defeated in the end. In this he was aided by the news of reverses in Bengal. Mir Jafar had finally rebelled over payments to British officials, and Clive's successor had put Kasim Ali Khan, Mir Jafar's son-in-law upon the musnud (throne). After a brief tenure, Kasim Ali had fled, ordering Walter Reinhardt Sombre (known to the Muslims as Sumru), a Swiss mercenary of his, to butcher the garrison of 150 British at Patna, and had disappeared under the protection of his brother, the Viceroy of Awadh. The whole company's service, civil and military, had become mired in corruption, demoralized by gifts and by the monopoly of inland and export trade, to such an extent that the Indians were pauperised, and the Company was plundered of the revenues Clive had acquired. For this Clive himself must bear much responsibility, as he had set a very poor example during his tenure as Governor. Nevertheless, the Court of Proprietors, forced the Directors to hurry Lord Clive to Bengal with the double powers of Governor and Commander- in-Chief. Third journey to India Clive meeting with Emperor Shah Alam II, 1765 On 3 May 1765 Clive landed at Calcutta to learn that Mir Jafar had died, leaving him personally ¬£70,000 (¬£21 million in 2009). Mir Jafar was succeeded by his son-in-law Kasim Ali, though not before the government had been further demoralized by taking ¬£100,000 (¬£30 million in 2009) as a gift from the new Nawab; while Kasim Ali had induced not only the viceroy of Awadh, but the emperor of Delhi himself, to invade Bihar. At this point a mutiny in the Bengal army occurred, which was a grim precursor of the Indian rebellion of 1857, but on this occasion it was quickly suppressed by blowing the sepoy ringleader from a gun. Major Munro, \\"the Napier of those times\\", scattered the united armies on the hard-fought field of Buxar. The emperor, Shah Alam II, detached himself from the league, while the Awadh viceroy threw himself on the mercy of the British. Miniature of Al-Khidr, from the \\"Small Clive Album\\" thought to have been given to Clive on his 1765‚Äì67 visit to India by Shuja ud- Daula, the Nawab of Awadh. The Album contains 62 folia of Mughal miniature paintings, drawing and floral pattern studies. The binding is from Indian brocade silk brought home by the 2nd Lord Clive, who served as Governor of Madras, 1799 to 1803. Acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1956. Clive had now an opportunity of repeating in Hindustan, or Upper India, what he had accomplished in Bengal. He might have secured what is now called Uttar Pradesh, and have rendered unnecessary the campaigns of Wellesley and Lake. But he believed he had other work in the exploitation of the revenues and resources of rich Bengal itself, making it a base from which British India would afterwards steadily grow. Hence he returned to the Awadh viceroy all his territory save the provinces of Allahabad and Kora, which he presented to the weak emperor. Mughal Firman In return for the Awadhian provinces Clive secured from the emperor one of the most important documents in British history in India, effectively granting title of Bengal to Clive. It appears in the records as \\"firman from the King Shah Aalum, granting the diwani rights of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha to the Company 1765.\\" The date was 12 August 1765, the place Benares, the throne an English dining-table covered with embroidered cloth and surmounted by a chair in Clive's tent. It is all pictured by a Muslim contemporary, who indignantly exclaims that so great a \\"transaction was done and finished in less time than would have been taken up in the sale of a jackass\\". By this deed the company became the real sovereign rulers of thirty million people, yielding a revenue of ¬£4,000,000 sterling (¬£1.2 billion sterling in 2009). On the same date Clive obtained not only an imperial charter for the company's possessions in the Carnatic, completing the work he began at Arcot, but a third firman for the highest of all the lieutenancies of the empire, that of the Deccan itself. This fact is mentioned in a letter from the secret committee of the court of directors to the Madras government, dated 27 April 1768. The British presence in India was still tiny compared to the number and strength of the princes and people of India, but also compared to the forces of their ambitious French, Dutch and Danish rivals. Clive had this in mind when he penned his last advice to the directors, as he finally left India in 1767: > \\"We are sensible that, since the acquisition of the dewany, the power > formerly belonging to the soubah of those provinces is totally, in fact, > vested in the East India Company. Nothing remains to him but the name and > shadow of authority. This name, however, this shadow, it is indispensably > necessary we should seem to venerate.\\" Attempts at administrative reform Having thus founded the Empire of British India, Clive sought to put in place a strong administration. The salaries of civil servants were increased, the acceptance of gifts from Indians was forbidden, and Clive exacted covenants under which participation in the inland trade was stopped. Unfortunately this had very little impact in reducing corruption, which remained widespread until the days of Warren Hastings. Clive's military reforms were more effective. He put down a mutiny of the British officers, who chose to resent the veto against receiving presents and the reduction of batta (extra pay) at a time when two Maratha armies were marching on Bengal. His reorganisation of the army, on the lines of that which he had begun after Plassey, neglected during his absence in Great Britain, subsequently attracted the admiration of Indian officers. He divided the whole army into three brigades, making each a complete force, in itself equal to any single Indian army that could be brought against it. Clive was also instrumental in making the company virtual master of North India by introducing his policy of \\"Dual system of government\\". According to the new arrangement enforced by him, the company became liable only for revenue affairs of Bengal (Diwani) and Bihar while the administration and law and order was made a prerogative of the Nawab. An office of \\"Deputy Nawab\\" was created, who was at the helms of all the affairs vis a vis revenue of two of the richest province of India besides being company's representative while the Nizamat(Law and order) remained in the hands of Nawab who appointed his own representative to deal with the company. This system proved to be detrimental for the administration of Bengal and ultimately the \\"Dual system of government\\" was abolished by the Warren Hastings. Retirement and death Clive left India for the last time in February 1767. In 1768, he lived for a time at the Chateau de Larzac in P√©zenas in the H√©rault d√©partement of the Languedoc-Roussillon region in southern France. Local tradition says that he was responsible for introducing the local pastry makers of P√©zenas to a sweet pastry, le petit p√¢t√© de P√©zenas, the size and shape of a large cotton reel with a sweet centre, and that he (or, more likely, his chef) had brought the recipe from India as a refined version of the savoury keema naan.Domaine de Larzac , coolvines.com, accessed 30 January 2012 P√©zenas is now known for these delicacies. A plaque in memory of Lord Clive in P√©zenas (France), where he stayed in 1768, and introduced a local delicacy, le petit p√¢t√© de P√©zenas. Later in 1768, Clive was made a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) and in the same year served as treasurer of the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury. In 1769, he acquired the house and gardens at Claremont near Esher and commissioned Lancelot \\"Capability\\" Brown to remodel the garden and rebuild the house. In 1772 Parliament opened an inquiry into the Company's practices in India. Clive's political opponents turned these hearings into attacks on Clive. Questioned about some of the large sums of money he had received while in India, Clive pointed out that they were not contrary to accepted company practice, and defended his behaviour by stating \\"I stand astonished at my own moderation\\" given opportunities for greater gain. The hearings highlighted the need for reform of the Company, and a vote to censure Clive for his actions failed. Later in 1772, Clive was invested Knight of the Bath (eight years after his knighthood had been awarded), and was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire. There was a great famine in Bengal between 1769 and 1773, which reduced the population of Bengal by a third. It was argued that the activities and aggrandizement of company officials was to blame for the famine, particularly the abuse of monopoly rights on trade and land tax used for the personal benefit of company officials.Smith, Adam (1776). The Wealth of Nations, Book 4, Chap. 5, Par. 45.Dirks, Nicholas (2006) The scandal of Empire- India and the creation of Imperial Britain These revelations and the subsequent debates in parliament reduced Clive's political popularity considerably. Clive continued to be involved in ongoing Parliamentary discussions on company reforms. During these, in 1773, General John Burgoyne, one of Clive's most vocal enemies, pressed the case that some of Clive's gains were made at the expense of the Company and the government. Clive again made a spirited defence of his actions, and closed his testimony by stating \\"Take my fortune, but save my honour.\\" The vote that followed completely exonerated Clive, who was commended for the \\"great and meritorious service\\" he rendered to the country. Immediately thereafter Parliament began debating the Regulating Act of 1773, which significantly reformed the East India Company's practices. On 22 November 1774 Clive died, aged forty-nine, at his Berkeley Square home in London. There was no inquest on his death and he cut his throat with a paper knife penknife, while a few newspapers reported his death as due to an apoplectic fit or stroke. One 20th-century biographer, John Watney, concluded: \\"He did not die from a self-inflicted wound ... He died as he severed his juglur with a blunt paper knife brought on by an overdose of drugs\\". While Clive left no suicide note, Samuel Johnson wrote that he \\"had acquired his fortune by such crimes that his consciousness of them impelled him to cut his own throat\\". Though Clive's demise has been linked to his history of depression and to opium addiction, the likely immediate impetus was excruciating pain resulting from illness (he was known to suffer from gallstones) which he had been attempting to abate with opium . Shortly beforehand, he had been offered command of British forces in North America which he had turned down.Harvey p.160 He was buried in St Margaret's Parish Church at Moreton Say, near his birthplace in Shropshire. Clive was awarded an Irish peerage in 1762, being created Baron Clive of Plassey, County Clare; he bought lands in County Limerick and County Clare, Ireland, naming part of his lands near Limerick City, Plassey. Following Irish independence, these lands became state property. In the 1970s a technical college, which later became the University of Limerick, was built at Plassey. Family George Clive and his family with an Indian maid, by Joshua Reynolds, 1765 Robert Clive married Margaret Maskelyne (d. 28 December 1817) on 18 February 1753, sister of the Rev. Dr Nevil Maskelyne, fifth Astronomer Royal, in Madras. They had nine children: * Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis (b. 7 March 1754, d. 16 May 1839) * Rebecca Clive (b. 15 September 1760, bapt 10 October 1760 Moreton Say, d.

The historian William Dalrymple has called Clive an \\"unstable sociopath\\", due to these policies and his actions leading to famines and other atrocities towards native populations in Bengal. Changes caused by Clive to the revenue system and existing agricultural practices, to maximize profits for the East India Company, led to the Bengal Famine of 1770 and increased poverty in Bengal. A proportion of the loot of Bengal went directly into Clive's pocket. Clive quoted about the oppression of Bengal: :I shall only say that such a scene of anarchy, confusion, bribery, corruption, and extortion was never seen or heard of in any country but Bengal; nor did such and so many fortunes acquire in so unjust and rapacious a manner. The three provinces of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa producing a clear revenue of ¬£3 millions sterling, have been under the absolute management of the company's servants, ever since Mir Jafar's restoration to the subahship; and they have, both civil and military, exacted and levied contributions from every man of power and consequence, from the Nawab down to the lowest zamindar. Following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May 2020 and the toppling by Black Lives Matter protestors of the statue of slave-trader Edward Colston in Bristol, several petitions were launched calling for the removal of the statue of Clive in the centre of The Square in Shrewsbury. Despite more than 20,000 signatures supporting such a move, on 16 July 2020 Shropshire Council voted 28-17 to retain the statue. Similar petitions have been launched to remove Robert Clive's statue from outside the FCO in Whitehall, accruing over 80,000 signatures.https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/2020/08/13/thug-of- hindustan.html Legacy A statue of Clive stands tall in Shrewsbury Square * Robert Clive's desk from his time at Market Drayton Grammar School is on display at Market Drayton museum complete with his carved initials.

Following the completion of the relocation of The Crystal Palace from Hyde Park to what is now Upper Norwood in 1854, the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway was opened on 10 June 1854 to cope with crowds visiting the Crystal Palace. This led to a huge increase in employment in the area and a subsequent increase in the building of residential properties.

Personal Leo was the brother of Carlos Cruz. Carlos had conquered the world Lightweight title by beating Carlos Ortiz in 1968, but lost his life in the Dominicana DC-9 air disaster of February 15, 1970. Early life Leo moved to Puerto Rico early in the 1970s, and began identifying himself as half Puerto Rican almost immediately. Pro career He began his successful professional boxing career in Puerto Rico, with a string of wins. Despite having beaten future two time world champion Lupe Pintor, however, Cruz was still a virtual unknown when given a chance to win the WBC world Jr. Featherweight championship. Despite losing by a knockout in the 13th round against world champion Wilfredo G√≥mez, his stock around the boxing world rose after that fight. Cruz kept on fighting, and winning, until he was given a second world title try, this time by the WBA world champion Sergio Victor Palma, in Buenos Aires. Cruz was beaten by a decision in 15 by the Argentine world champion, but in a rematch on 12 June 1982 at Miami, Cruz became world champion by defeating Palma by a decision, also in 15 rounds. Cruz in his first defense knocked out Benito Badilla of Chile in eight rounds, at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. When G√≥mez left his WBC title vacant soon after, Cruz became recognized by most fans as the universal world champion. Then, he defeated South Korean challenger Soon-Hyun Chung, by decision in 15; after dropping him in round eight; also in San Juan. In his first defense at his home country, Cruz put his title on the line on August 1983 against Nicaraguan challenger Cleo Garcia at Santo Domingo. Cruz retained the title by a decision. With a defense against Puerto Rican Victor Luvi Callejas looming ahead, Cruz went to Milan in February 1984, and, while defending his crown against Italian Loris Stecca, was stopped in round 12, therefore losing the WBA world junior featherweight title. Comeback Cruz attempted a comeback in 1985, winning one fight, but retiring for good after that.

Goodman (1963) proposed on this basis to include the great apes (orang utan, gorilla and chimpanzee) in the family Hominidate, a view revived by Groves (1986) and increasingly adopted since then. Increasingly, too, the vernacular term 'Great Apes' has come to be used as a pure synonym for Hominidae, so that humans are also 'Great Apes.' The only remaining systemic controversy seems to be whether chimpanzees and gorillas together form the sister-group of humans, or chimpanzees and humans together constitute the sister-group of gorillas.\\"Karcher, Karen. \\"The Great Ape Project\\" in Marc Bekoff (ed.).

Status Hercules and Leo Habeas Corpus Order On February 28, 2007, the parliament of the Balearic Islands, an autonomous community of Spain, passed the world's first legislation that would effectively grant legal personhood rights to all great apes. The act sent ripples out of the region and across Spain, producing public support for the rights of great apes. On June 25, 2008 a parliamentary committee set forth resolutions urging Spain to grant the primates the rights to life and liberty. If approved \\"it will ban harmful experiments on apes and make keeping them for circuses, television commercials, or filming illegal under Spain's penal code.\\" These precedents followed years of European legal efforts. In 1992, Switzerland amended its constitution to recognize animals as beings and not things. However, in 1999 the Swiss constitution was completely rewritten. A decade later, Germany guaranteed rights to animals in a 2002 amendment to its constitution, becoming the first European Union member to do so. New Zealand created specific legal protections for five great ape species in 1999. The use of any gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo, or orangutan in research, testing or teaching being limited to only those activities intended to benefit the animal subject or its species. A New Zealand animal protection group later argued the restrictions conferred weak legal rights.\\"A STEP AT A TIME: NEW ZEALAND'S PROGRESS TOWARD HOMINID RIGHTS\\" BY ROWAN TAYLOR Several European countries (including Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden) completely banned the use of great apes in animal testings. Austria was the first country to ban experimentation on lesser apes. Under EU Directive 2010/63/EU, the entire European Union banned great ape experimentation in 2013. Argentina granted a captive orangutan basic human rights, starting from late 2014. On April 20, 2015, Justice Barbara Jaffe of New York State Supreme Court ordered a writ of habeas corpus to two captive chimpanzees but the next day the ruling was amended to strike the words \\"writ of habeas corpus\\".David Kravets Ars Technica (8/3/2015) No habeas corpus; chimps are lab ‚Äúproperty‚Äù: \\"Animals, including chimpanzees,\\" judge rules, \\"are considered property.\\" Advocacy Well-known advocates include primatologist Jane Goodall, who was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations to fight the bushmeat trade and end ape extinction; Richard Dawkins, former Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University; Peter Singer, professor of philosophy at Princeton University; and attorney and former Harvard professor Steven Wise, founder and president of the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP), whose aim is to work through U.S. common law on a state-by-state basis to achieve recognition of legal personhood for great apes and other self-aware, autonomous nonhuman animals; all advocate for great ape personhood. In December 2013, the NhRP filed three lawsuits on behalf of four chimpanzees being held in captivity in New York State, arguing that they should be recognized as legal persons with the fundamental right to bodily liberty (i.e. not to be held in captivity) and that they are entitled to common law writs of habeas corpus and should be immediately freed and moved to sanctuaries. All three petitions for writs of habeas corpus were denied, allowing for the right to appeal. The NhRP is in the process of appealing all three decisions. Goodall's longitudinal studies revealed the social and family life of chimps to be very similar to that of human beings in some respects. She herself calls them individuals, and says they relate to her as an individual member of the clan. Laboratory studies of ape language ability began to reveal other human traits, as did genetics, and eventually three of the great apes were reclassified as hominids. Other studies, such as one done by Beran & Evans, indicate other qualities that humans share with non-human primates, namely the ability to self-control. In order for chimpanzees to control their impulsivity, they use self-distraction techniques similar to those that are used by children. Great apes also exhibited ability to plan as well as project \\"oneself into the future\\", known as the process of mental time travel. Such complicated tasks require self- awareness, which great apes appear to possess: \\"the capacity that contribute to the ability to delay gratification, since a self-aware individual may be able to imagine future states of the self\\". This, alongside the increasing risk of great ape extinction, had led the animal rights movement to put pressure on nations to recognize apes as having limited rights and being legal \\"persons.\\" In response, the United Kingdom introduced a ban on research using great apes, although testing on other primates has not been limited. Writer and lecturer Thomas Rose makes the argument that granting legal rights afforded to humans to non-humans is nothing new. He points out that in the majority of the world, \\"corporations are recognized as legal persons and are granted many of the same rights humans enjoy, the right to sue, to vote and to freedom of speech.\\" Dawn Prince-Hughes has written that great apes meet the commonly accepted standards for personhood: \\"self-awareness; comprehension of past, present, and future; the ability to understand complex rules and their consequences on emotional levels; the ability to choose to risk those consequences, a capacity for empathy, and the ability to think abstractly.\\" Gary Francione questions the concept of granting personhood on the basis of whether the animal in question is human-like (as some have argued for great apes), and clarifies that sentience is the sole characteristic an animal requires to have basic rights. Therefore, he asserts, other animals‚Äîincluding mice and rats‚Äîshould also be granted such rights. Interpretation Depending on the precise wording of any proposed or adopted declaration, personhood for the Great Apes may raise questions concerning protections and obligations under national and international laws, such as: * Articles 7‚Äì29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights * The 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness regarding nationality and citizenship for persons * Provisions 4 & 5 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child See also * Animal testing on non-human primates * Biolinguistics * Emotion in animals * Great Ape Project * International Primate Day * International trade in primates * List of notable apes * Primate cognition * Speciesism * The Mentality of Apes * The Mind of an Ape * Theory of mind References Category:Animal rights Category:Apes Category:Personhood Category:Primatology Category:Legal entities ","title":"Great ape personhood"},{"id":"170124","text":"Paul Charles Dominic Doherty (born 21 September 1946)Profile, Shelfari.com; accessed 14 April 2014.] is an English author, educator, lecturer and historian.

Plot In New York City, Karen (Rainbow Harvest) is a streetwise teen from a lower-middle-class family with a emotionally and sometimes physically abusive father who pursues a friendship with 11-year-old Lonnie (Sarah Boyd). Lonnie is from a wealthy, upper-class family. After becoming friends, over the course of the summer they expose each other to the very different lifestyles they live. In the process, they learn lessons each culture has to offer. The situation becomes complicated when Karen's brother, Johnny (Neill Barry), shows interest in Lonnie and Lonnie begins to develop a crush on him. Soon, a sensual new neighbor (Roxanne Hart) moves into Karen's apartment building, and Johnny becomes slightly infatuated with her. Circumstances arise that will test Karen and Lonnie's friendship.

The process governing the exposures arguably resembles random assignment. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment. Natural experiments are most useful when there has been a clearly defined exposure involving a well defined subpopulation (and the absence of exposure in a similar subpopulation) such that changes in outcomes may be plausibly attributed to the exposure. In this sense, the difference between a natural experiment and a non-experimental observational study is that the former includes a comparison of conditions that pave the way for causal inference, but the latter does not. Natural experiments are employed as study designs when controlled experimentation is extremely difficult to implement or unethical, such as in several research areas addressed by epidemiology (like evaluating the health impact of varying degrees of exposure to ionizing radiation in people living near Hiroshima at the time of the atomic blast) and economics (like estimating the economic return on amount of schooling in US adults). History John Snow's map showing the clustering of cholera cases in Soho during the London epidemic of 1854 One of the best-known early natural experiments was the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in London, England. On 31 August 1854, a major outbreak of cholera struck Soho. Over the next three days, 127 people near Broad Street died. By the end of the outbreak 616 people died. The physician John Snow identified the source of the outbreak as the nearest public water pump, using a map of deaths and illness that revealed a cluster of cases around the pump. In this example, Snow discovered a strong association between the use of the water from the pump, and deaths and illnesses due to cholera. Snow found that the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company, which supplied water to districts with high attack rates, obtained the water from the Thames downstream from where raw sewage was discharged into the river. By contrast, districts that were supplied water by the Lambeth Waterworks Company, which obtained water upstream from the points of sewage discharge, had low attack rates. Given the near-haphazard patchwork development of the water supply in mid-nineteenth century London, Snow viewed the developments as \\"an experiment...on the grandest scale.\\"Snow, J. (1855). On the Mode of Communication of Cholera (2nd ed.). London: Churchill. Excerpted in MacMahon, B. & Pugh, T.F. (1970). Epidemiology. Boston: Little Brown. Of course, the exposure to the polluted water was not under the control of any scientist. Therefore, this exposure has been recognized as being a natural experiment.The 1854 cholera outbreak is the example of a natural experiment discussed often by David A. Freedman, e.g. in Statistical Models: Theory and Practice (Cambridge University Press) , chapter 1.3 (pp. 6‚Äì9).MacMahon, B., & Pugh, T.F. (1970). Epidemiology: Principles and Methods. Boston: Little, Brown.Snow's studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle. After the handle of the well-pump was replaced, the incidence of new cases dropped. In stopping the use of water from the well- pump, the authorities conducted, in effect, a second study, an uncontrolled intervention study, a study with an intervention group but no control group. Recent examples=Family size= An aim of a study Angrist and Evans (1998) was to estimate the effect of family size on the labor market outcomes of the mother. For at least two reasons, the correlations between family size and various outcomes (e.g., earnings) do not inform us about how family size causally affects labor market outcomes. First, both labor market outcomes and family size may be affected by unobserved \\"third\\" variables (e.g., personal preferences). Second, labor market outcomes themselves may affect family size (called \\"reverse causality\\"). For example, a woman may defer having a child if she gets a raise at work. The authors observed that two-child families with either two boys or two girls are substantially more likely to have a third child than two-child families with one boy and one girl. The sex of the first two children, then, constitutes a kind of natural experiment: it is as if an experimenter had randomly assigned some families to have two children and others to have three. The authors were then able to credibly estimate the causal effect of having a third child on labor market outcomes. Angrist and Evans found that childbearing had a greater impact on poor and less educated women than on highly educated women although the earnings impact of having a third child tended to disappear by that child's 13th birthday. They also found that having a third child had little impact on husbands' earnings. =Game shows= Within economics, game shows are a frequently studied form of natural experiment. While game shows might seem to be artificial contexts, they can be considered natural experiments due to the fact that the context arises without interference of the scientist. Game shows have been used to study a wide range of different types of economic behavior, such as decision making under risk and cooperative behavior. =Smoking ban= In Helena, Montana a smoking ban was in effect in all public spaces, including bars and restaurants, during the six-month period from June 2002 to December 2002. Helena is geographically isolated and served by only one hospital. The investigators observed that the rate of heart attacks dropped by 40% while the smoking ban was in effect. Opponents of the law prevailed in getting the enforcement of the law suspended after six months, after which the rate of heart attacks went back up. This study was an example of a natural experiment, called a case-crossover experiment, where the exposure is removed for a time and then returned. The study also potentially suggests that the inability to control variables in natural experiments can impede investigators from drawing firm conclusions. Critics argued that the particularly large percentage fluctuation in the rate of myocardial infarction was likely due to chance, given the small population size. =Nuclear weapons testing= Nuclear weapons testing released large quantities of radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere, some of which could be incorporated into biological tissues. The release stopped after the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which prohibited atmospheric nuclear tests. This resembled a large-scale pulse-chase experiment, but could not have been performed as a regular experiment in humans due to scientific ethics. Several types of observations were made possible (in people born before 1963), such as determination of the rate of replacement for cells in different human tissues. =Vietnam War draft= An important question in economics research is what determines earnings. Angrist (1990) evaluated the effects of military service on lifetime earnings. Using statistical methods developed in econometrics,Lambert, B. (2013). Natural experiments in econometrics. Youtube video Angrist capitalized on the approximate random assignment of the Vietnam War draft lottery, and used it as an instrumental variable associated with eligibility (or non-eligibility) for military service. Because many factors might predict whether someone serves in the military, the draft lottery frames a natural experiment whereby those drafted into the military can be compared against those not drafted because the two groups should not differ substantially prior to military service. Angrist found that the earnings of veterans were, on average, about 15 percent less than the earnings of non- veterans. =Industrial melanism= With the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, many species of moth, including the well-studied peppered moth, responded to the atmospheric pollution of sulphur dioxide and soot around cities with industrial melanism, a dramatic increase in the frequency of dark forms over the formerly abundant pale, speckled forms. In the twentieth century, as regulation improved and pollution fell, providing the conditions for a large-scale natural experiment, the trend towards industrial melanism was reversed, and melanic forms quickly became scarce. The effect led the evolutionary biologists L. M. Cook and J. R. G. Turner to conclude that \\"natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline\\".

Biography La Bourdonnais entered the service of the French East India Company as a lieutenant. In 1724, he was promoted to captain, and displayed such bravery in the capture of Mah√© on the Malabar Coast that the name of the town was added to his own; although an alternative account suggests that the town adopted his name, rather than the other way around. For two years he was in the service of the Portuguese Viceroy, but in 1735 he returned to French service as governor of the Isle de France (now Mauritius) and the √éle de Bourbon (R√©union). His first five years' administration of the islands was vigorous and successful. His name was also given to the main island (Mah√© Island) of the Seychelles archepellego by Lazare Picault 1742 in his honour while he was goveronor of Mauritius.

In a Fermi gas, the lowest occupied state is taken to have zero kinetic energy, whereas in a metal, the lowest occupied state is typically taken to mean the bottom of the conduction band. The term \\"Fermi energy\\" is often used to refer to a different yet closely related concept, the Fermi level (also called electrochemical potential).The use of the term \\"Fermi energy\\" as synonymous with Fermi level (a.k.a. electrochemical potential) is widespread in semiconductor physics. For example: Electronics (fundamentals And Applications) by D. Chattopadhyay, Semiconductor Physics and Applications by Balkanski and Wallis. There are a few key differences between the Fermi level and Fermi energy, at least as they are used in this article: * The Fermi energy is only defined at absolute zero, while the Fermi level is defined for any temperature. * The Fermi energy is an energy difference (usually corresponding to a kinetic energy), whereas the Fermi level is a total energy level including kinetic energy and potential energy. * The Fermi energy can only be defined for non-interacting fermions (where the potential energy or band edge is a static, well defined quantity), whereas the Fermi level remains well defined even in complex interacting systems, at thermodynamic equilibrium. Since the Fermi level in a metal at absolute zero is the energy of the highest occupied single particle state, then the Fermi energy in a metal is the energy difference between the Fermi level and lowest unoccupied single-particle state, at zero-temperature. Context In quantum mechanics, a group of particles known as fermions (for example, electrons, protons and neutrons) obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This states that two fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state. Since an idealized non-interacting Fermi gas can be analyzed in terms of single-particle stationary states, we can thus say that two fermions cannot occupy the same stationary state. These stationary states will typically be distinct in energy. To find the ground state of the whole system, we start with an empty system, and add particles one at a time, consecutively filling up the unoccupied stationary states with the lowest energy. When all the particles have been put in, the Fermi energy is the kinetic energy of the highest occupied state. As a consequence, even if we have extracted all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This speed is known as the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the related Fermi temperature, do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero. The Fermi energy is an important concept in the solid state physics of metals and superconductors. It is also a very important quantity in the physics of quantum liquids like low temperature helium (both normal and superfluid 3He), and it is quite important to nuclear physics and to understanding the stability of white dwarf stars against gravitational collapse. Formula and typical values The Fermi energy for a non-interacting ensemble of identical spin-¬Ω fermions in a three-dimensional (non-relativistic) system is given by : E_\\\\text{F} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m_0} \\\\left( \\\\frac{3 \\\\pi^2 N}{V} \\\\right)^{2/3}, where N is the number of particles, m0 the rest mass of each fermion, V the volume of the system, and \\\\hbar the reduced Planck constant. =Metals= Under the free electron model, the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas. The number density N/V of conduction electrons in metals ranges between approximately 1028 and 1029 electrons/m3, which is also the typical density of atoms in ordinary solid matter. This number density produces a Fermi energy of the order of 2 to 10 electronvolts. =White dwarfs= Stars known as white dwarfs have mass comparable to our Sun, but have about a hundredth of its radius. The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. Their Fermi energy is about 0.3 MeV. =Nucleus= Another typical example is that of the nucleons in the nucleus of an atom. The radius of the nucleus admits deviations, so a typical value for the Fermi energy is usually given as 38 MeV.  Related quantities  Using this definition of above for the Fermi energy, various related quantities can be useful. The Fermi temperature is defined as : T_\\\\text{F} = \\\\frac{E_\\\\text{F}}{k_\\\\text{B}}, where k_\\\\text{B} is the Boltzmann constant, and E_\\\\text{F} the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature can be thought of as the temperature at which thermal effects are comparable to quantum effects associated with Fermi statistics. The Fermi temperature for a metal is a couple of orders of magnitude above room temperature. Other quantities defined in this context are Fermi momentum : p_\\\\text{F} = \\\\sqrt{2 m_0 E_\\\\text{F}} and Fermi velocity : v_\\\\text{F} = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{F}}{m_0}. These quantities are respectively the momentum and group velocity of a fermion at the Fermi surface. The Fermi momentum can also be described as : p_\\\\text{F} = \\\\hbar k_\\\\text{F}, where k_\\\\text{F}, called the Fermi wavevector, is the radius of the Fermi sphere. These quantities may not be well-defined in cases where the Fermi surface is non-spherical.

Shown: distribution of particle speed for 106 oxygen particles at -100, 20 and 600 ¬∞C. In statistical mechanics, Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics describes the average distribution of non-interacting material particles over various energy states in thermal equilibrium, and is applicable when the temperature is high enough or the particle density is low enough to render quantum effects negligible. The expected number of particles with energy \\\\varepsilon_i for Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics is : \\\\langle N_i \\\\rangle = \\\\frac {g_i} {e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i - \\\\mu)/kT}} = \\\\frac{N}{Z}\\\\,g_i e^{-\\\\varepsilon_i/kT}, where: *\\\\varepsilon_i is the i-th energy level, *\\\\langle N_i \\\\rangle is the average number of particles in the set of states with energy \\\\varepsilon_i, *g_i is the degeneracy of energy level i, that is, the number of states with energy \\\\varepsilon_i which may nevertheless be distinguished from each other by some other means,For example, two simple point particles may have the same energy, but different momentum vectors. They may be distinguished from each other on this basis, and the degeneracy will be the number of possible ways that they can be so distinguished. *Œº is the chemical potential, *k is Boltzmann's constant, *T is absolute temperature, *N is the total number of particles: ::N = \\\\sum_i N_i, *Z is the partition function: ::Z = \\\\sum_i g_i e^{-\\\\varepsilon_i/kT}, *e(...) is the exponential function. Equivalently, the number of particles is sometimes expressed as : \\\\langle N_i \\\\rangle = \\\\frac {1} {e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i - \\\\mu)/kT}} = \\\\frac{N}{Z}\\\\,e^{-\\\\varepsilon_i/kT}, where the index i now specifies a particular state rather than the set of all states with energy \\\\varepsilon_i, and Z = \\\\sum_i e^{-\\\\varepsilon_i/kT}. Applications Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics may be used to derive the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution (for an ideal gas of classical particles in a three-dimensional box). However, they apply to other situations as well. Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics can be used to extend that distribution to particles with a different energy‚Äìmomentum relation, such as relativistic particles (Maxwell‚ÄìJ√ºttner distribution). In addition, hypothetical situations can be considered, such as particles in a box with different numbers of dimensions (four-dimensional, two-dimensional, etc.) Limits of applicability Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics are often described as the statistics of \\"distinguishable\\" classical particles. In other words, the configuration of particle A in state 1 and particle B in state 2 is different from the case in which particle B is in state 1 and particle A is in state 2. This assumption leads to the proper (Boltzmann) statistics of particles in the energy states, but yields non-physical results for the entropy, as embodied in the Gibbs paradox. At the same time, there are no real particles which have the characteristics required by Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics. Indeed, the Gibbs paradox is resolved if we treat all particles of a certain type (e.g., electrons, protons, etc.) as indistinguishable, and this assumption can be justified in the context of quantum mechanics. Once this assumption is made, the particle statistics change. Quantum particles are either bosons (following instead Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics) or fermions (subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, following instead Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics). Both of these quantum statistics approach the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics in the limit of high temperature and low particle density, without the need for any ad hoc assumptions. The Fermi‚ÄìDirac and Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics give the energy level occupation as: : \\\\langle N_i \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\mu)/kT}\\\\pm 1}. It can be seen that the condition under which the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics are valid is when :e^{(\\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm min}-\\\\mu)/kT} \\\\gg 1, where \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\rm min} is the lowest (minimum) value of \\\\varepsilon_i. * In the limit of low particle density, \\\\langle N_i \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\mu)/k_{\\\\rm B}T}\\\\pm 1} \\\\ll 1 , therefore e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\mu)/k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\pm 1 \\\\gg 1 or equivalently e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\mu)/k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\gg 1 . * In the limit of high temperature, the particles are distributed over a large range of energy values, therefore the occupancy on each state is again very small, \\\\langle N_i \\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\mu)/k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\pm 1} \\\\ll 1 . This again gives e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\mu)/k_{\\\\rm B}T} \\\\gg 1 . Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics are particularly useful for studying gases that are not very dense. Note, however, that all of these statistics assume that the particles are non- interacting and have static energy states.  Derivations  Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics can be derived in various statistical mechanical thermodynamic ensembles: * The grand canonical ensemble, exactly. * The canonical ensemble, but only in the thermodynamic limit. * The microcanonical ensemble, exactly In each case it is necessary to assume that the particles are non-interacting, and that multiple particles can occupy the same state and do so independently. = Derivation from microcanonical ensemble = Suppose we have a container with a huge number of very small particles all with identical physical characteristics (such as mass, charge, etc.). Let's refer to this as the system. Assume that though the particles have identical properties, they are distinguishable. For example, we might identify each particle by continually observing their trajectories, or by placing a marking on each one, e.g., drawing a different number on each one as is done with lottery balls. The particles are moving inside that container in all directions with great speed. Because the particles are speeding around, they possess some energy. The Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution is a mathematical function that describes about how many particles in the container have a certain energy. More precisely, the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution gives the non-normalized probability that the state corresponding to a particular energy is occupied. In general, there may be many particles with the same amount of energy \\\\varepsilon. Let the number of particles with the same energy \\\\varepsilon_1 be N_1, the number of particles possessing another energy \\\\varepsilon_2 be N_2, and so forth for all the possible energies \\\\\\\\{ \\\\varepsilon_i\\\\mid i=1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}. To describe this situation, we say that N_i is the occupation number of the energy level i. If we know all the occupation numbers \\\\\\\\{N_i \\\\mid i=1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}, then we know the total energy of the system. However, because we can distinguish between which particles are occupying each energy level, the set of occupation numbers \\\\\\\\{ N_i \\\\mid i=1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} does not completely describe the state of the system. To completely describe the state of the system, or the microstate, we must specify exactly which particles are in each energy level. Thus when we count the number of possible states of the system, we must count each and every microstate, and not just the possible sets of occupation numbers. To begin with, let's ignore the degeneracy problem: assume that there is only one way to put N_i particles into the energy level i . What follows next is a bit of combinatorial thinking which has little to do in accurately describing the reservoir of particles. For instance, let's say there is a total of k boxes labelled a,b,\\\\ldots,k. With the concept of combination, we could calculate how many ways to arrange N balls into respective l-th box in which there would be N_l balls without an order. To begin with, we select N_a balls from a total of N balls, placing them in box a, and continuing on selection from the remaining until no ball is left outside. The total number of arrangements is : \\\\begin{align} W & = \\\\frac{N!}{N_a!(N-N_a)!} \\\\times \\\\frac{(N-N_a)!}{N_b!(N-N_a-N_b)!} \\\\times \\\\frac{(N-N_a-N_b)!}{N_c!(N-N_a-N_b- N_c)!} \\\\times \\\\cdots \\\\times \\\\frac{(N-\\\\cdots-N_\\\\ell)!}{N_k!(N-\\\\cdots-N_\\\\ell- N_k)!} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\frac{N!}{N_a!N_b!N_c!\\\\cdots N_k!(N-\\\\cdots-N_\\\\ell-N_k)!} \\\\end{align} and because not even a single ball is to be left outside the boxes (all balls should be put in boxes), which implies that the sum made of the terms N_a, N_b, \\\\ldots, N_k must equal to N; thus the term (N - N_a - N_b - \\\\cdots - N_k)! in the relation above evaluates to 0! (0! = 1), and we simplify the relation as : W = N!\\\\prod_{\\\\ell=a,b,\\\\ldots}^k \\\\frac{1}{N_\\\\ell!} This is just the multinomial coefficient, the number of ways of arranging N items into k boxes, the l-th box holding Nl items, ignoring the permutation of items in each box. Now going back to the degeneracy problem which characterizes the reservoir of particles. If the i-th box has a \\"degeneracy\\" of g_i, that is, it has g_i \\"sub-boxes\\", such that any way of filling the i-th box where the number in the sub-boxes is changed is a distinct way of filling the box, then the number of ways of filling the i-th box must be increased by the number of ways of distributing the N_i objects in the g_i \\"sub-boxes\\". The number of ways of placing N_i distinguishable objects in g_i \\"sub-boxes\\" is g_i^{N_i} (the first object can go into any of the g_i boxes, the second object can also go into any of the g_i boxes, and so on). Thus the number of ways W that a total of N particles can be classified into energy levels according to their energies, while each level i having g_i distinct states such that the i-th level accommodates N_i particles is: :W=N!\\\\prod_{i}\\\\frac{g_i^{N_i}}{N_i!} This is the form for W first derived by Boltzmann. Boltzmann's fundamental equation S=k\\\\,\\\\ln W relates the thermodynamic entropy S to the number of microstates W, where k is the Boltzmann constant. It was pointed out by Gibbs however, that the above expression for W does not yield an extensive entropy, and is therefore faulty. This problem is known as the Gibbs paradox. The problem is that the particles considered by the above equation are not indistinguishable. In other words, for two particles (A and B) in two energy sublevels the population represented by [A,B] is considered distinct from the population [B,A] while for indistinguishable particles, they are not. If we carry out the argument for indistinguishable particles, we are led to the Bose‚ÄìEinstein expression for W: :W=\\\\prod_i \\\\frac{(N_i+g_i-1)!}{N_i!(g_i-1)!} The Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution follows from this Bose‚ÄìEinstein distribution for temperatures well above absolute zero, implying that g_i\\\\gg 1. The Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution also requires low density, implying that g_i\\\\gg N_i. Under these conditions, we may use Stirling's approximation for the factorial: : N! \\\\approx N^N e^{-N}, to write: :W\\\\approx\\\\prod_i \\\\frac{(N_i+g_i)^{N_i+g_i}}{N_i^{N_i}g_i^{g_i}}\\\\approx\\\\prod_i \\\\frac{g_i^{N_i}(1+N_i/g_i)^{g_i}}{N_i^{N_i}} Using the fact that (1+N_i/g_i)^{g_i}\\\\approx e^{N_i} for g_i\\\\gg N_i we can again use Stirling's approximation to write: :W\\\\approx\\\\prod_i \\\\frac{g_i^{N_i}}{N_i!} This is essentially a division by N! of Boltzmann's original expression for W, and this correction is referred to as '. We wish to find the N_i for which the function W is maximized, while considering the constraint that there is a fixed number of particles \\\\left(N=\\\\textstyle\\\\sum N_i\\\\right) and a fixed energy \\\\left(E=\\\\textstyle\\\\sum N_i \\\\varepsilon_i\\\\right) in the container. The maxima of W and \\\\ln(W) are achieved by the same values of N_i and, since it is easier to accomplish mathematically, we will maximize the latter function instead. We constrain our solution using Lagrange multipliers forming the function: : f(N_1,N_2,\\\\ldots,N_n)=\\\\ln(W)+\\\\alpha(N-\\\\sum N_i)+\\\\beta(E-\\\\sum N_i \\\\varepsilon_i) : \\\\ln W=\\\\ln\\\\left[\\\\prod\\\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\\\frac{g_i^{N_i}}{N_i!}\\\\right] \\\\approx \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\left(N_i\\\\ln g_i-N_i\\\\ln N_i + N_i\\\\right) Finally : f(N_1,N_2,\\\\ldots,N_n)=\\\\alpha N +\\\\beta E + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\left(N_i\\\\ln g_i-N_i\\\\ln N_i + N_i-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta\\\\varepsilon_i) N_i\\\\right) In order to maximize the expression above we apply Fermat's theorem (stationary points), according to which local extrema, if exist, must be at critical points (partial derivatives vanish): : \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial N_i}=\\\\ln g_i-\\\\ln N_i -(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta\\\\varepsilon_i) = 0 By solving the equations above (i=1\\\\ldots n) we arrive to an expression for N_i: : N_i = \\\\frac{g_i}{e^{\\\\alpha+\\\\beta \\\\varepsilon_i}} Substituting this expression for N_i into the equation for \\\\ln W and assuming that N\\\\gg 1 yields: :\\\\ln W = (\\\\alpha+1) N+\\\\beta E\\\\, or, rearranging: :E=\\\\frac{\\\\ln W}{\\\\beta}-\\\\frac{N}{\\\\beta}-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha N}{\\\\beta} Boltzmann realized that this is just an expression of the Euler-integrated fundamental equation of thermodynamics. Identifying E as the internal energy, the Euler-integrated fundamental equation states that : :E=TS-PV+\\\\mu N where T is the temperature, P is pressure, V is volume, and Œº is the chemical potential. Boltzmann's famous equation S=k\\\\,\\\\ln W is the realization that the entropy is proportional to \\\\ln W with the constant of proportionality being Boltzmann's constant. Using the ideal gas equation of state (PV = NkT), It follows immediately that \\\\beta=1/kT and \\\\alpha=-\\\\mu/kT so that the populations may now be written: : N_i = \\\\frac{g_i}{e^{(\\\\varepsilon_i-\\\\mu)/(kT)}} Note that the above formula is sometimes written: : N_i = \\\\frac{g_i}{e^{\\\\varepsilon_i/kT}/z} where z=\\\\exp(\\\\mu/kT) is the absolute activity. Alternatively, we may use the fact that :\\\\sum_i N_i=N\\\\, to obtain the population numbers as : N_i = N\\\\frac{g_i e^{-\\\\varepsilon_i/kT}}{Z} where Z is the partition function defined by: : Z = \\\\sum_i g_i e^{-\\\\varepsilon_i/kT} In an approximation where Œµi is considered to be a continuous variable, the Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation yields a continuous degeneracy g proportional to \\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon} so that: : \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\,e^{-\\\\varepsilon/k T}}{\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\sqrt{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\,e^{-\\\\varepsilon/k T}} which is just the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution for the energy. = Derivation from canonical ensemble = In the above discussion, the Boltzmann distribution function was obtained via directly analysing the multiplicities of a system. Alternatively, one can make use of the canonical ensemble. In a canonical ensemble, a system is in thermal contact with a reservoir. While energy is free to flow between the system and the reservoir, the reservoir is thought to have infinitely large heat capacity as to maintain constant temperature, T, for the combined system. In the present context, our system is assumed to have the energy levels \\\\varepsilon _i with degeneracies g_i. As before, we would like to calculate the probability that our system has energy \\\\varepsilon_i. If our system is in state \\\\; s_1, then there would be a corresponding number of microstates available to the reservoir. Call this number \\\\; \\\\Omega _ R (s_1). By assumption, the combined system (of the system we are interested in and the reservoir) is isolated, so all microstates are equally probable. Therefore, for instance, if \\\\; \\\\Omega _ R (s_1) = 2 \\\\; \\\\Omega _ R (s_2) , we can conclude that our system is twice as likely to be in state \\\\; s_1 than \\\\; s_2. In general, if \\\\; P(s_i) is the probability that our system is in state \\\\; s_i, :\\\\frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} = \\\\frac{\\\\Omega _ R (s_1)}{\\\\Omega _ R (s_2)}. Since the entropy of the reservoir \\\\; S_R = k \\\\ln \\\\Omega _R, the above becomes :\\\\frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} = \\\\frac{ e^{S_R(s_1)/k} }{ e^{S_R(s_2)/k} } = e^{(S_R (s_1) - S_R (s_2))/k}. Next we recall the thermodynamic identity (from the first law of thermodynamics): :d S_R = \\\\frac{1}{T} (d U_R + P \\\\, d V_R - \\\\mu \\\\, d N_R). In a canonical ensemble, there is no exchange of particles, so the d N_R term is zero. Similarly, d V_R = 0. This gives : S_R (s_1) - S_R (s_2) = \\\\frac{1}{T} (U_R (s_1) - U_R (s_2)) = - \\\\frac{1}{T} (E(s_1) - E(s_2)), where \\\\; U_R (s_i) and \\\\; E(s_i) denote the energies of the reservoir and the system at s_i, respectively. For the second equality we have used the conservation of energy. Substituting into the first equation relating P(s_1), \\\\; P(s_2): : \\\\frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} = \\\\frac{ e^{ - E(s_1) / kT } }{ e^{ - E(s_2) / kT} }, which implies, for any state s of the system : P(s) = \\\\frac{1}{Z} e^{- E(s) / kT}, where Z is an appropriately chosen \\"constant\\" to make total probability 1. (Z is constant provided that the temperature T is invariant.) :\\\\; Z = \\\\sum _s e^{- E(s) / kT}, where the index s runs through all microstates of the system. Z is sometimes called the Boltzmann sum over states (or \\"Zustandssumme\\" in the original German). If we index the summation via the energy eigenvalues instead of all possible states, degeneracy must be taken into account. The probability of our system having energy \\\\varepsilon _i is simply the sum of the probabilities of all corresponding microstates: :P (\\\\varepsilon _i) = \\\\frac{1}{Z} g_i e^{- \\\\varepsilon_i / kT} where, with obvious modification, :Z = \\\\sum _j g_j e^{- \\\\varepsilon _j / kT}, this is the same result as before. Comments on this derivation: *Notice that in this formulation, the initial assumption \\"... suppose the system has total N particles...\\" is dispensed with. Indeed, the number of particles possessed by the system plays no role in arriving at the distribution. Rather, how many particles would occupy states with energy \\\\varepsilon _i follows as an easy consequence. *What has been presented above is essentially a derivation of the canonical partition function. As one can see by comparing the definitions, the Boltzmann sum over states is equal to the canonical partition function. *Exactly the same approach can be used to derive Fermi‚ÄìDirac and Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics. However, there one would replace the canonical ensemble with the grand canonical ensemble, since there is exchange of particles between the system and the reservoir. Also, the system one considers in those cases is a single particle state, not a particle. (In the above discussion, we could have assumed our system to be a single atom.)

Languages which use the term Protocol include: * Clojure * Elixir * Java 8 * Logtalk * Objective-C * Swift * PythonOfficial Python 3 Documentation, Abstract Object Layer In these languages, a protocol is a common means for discrete objects to communicate with each other. These are definitions of methods and values which the objects agree upon, in order to co-operate, as part of an API. The protocol/interface is a description of: # The messages that are understood by the object. # The arguments that these messages may be supplied with. # The types of results that these messages return. # The invariants that are preserved despite modifications to the state of an object. # The exceptional situations that will be required to be handled by clients to the object. # (For the communications-style usage only:) The call sequence and decision points of the methods, such as would be represented in UML interaction diagrams: Communication diagram, Sequence diagram, Interaction overview diagram/Activity diagram, Timing diagram. If the objects are fully encapsulated then the protocol will describe the only way in which objects may be accessed by other objects. For example, in Java interfaces, the \`Comparable\` interface specifies a method \`compareTo()\` which implementing classes must implement. This means that a separate sorting method, for example, can sort any object which implements the Comparable interface, without having to know anything about the inner nature of the class (except that two of these objects can be compared by means of \`compareTo()\`). Some programming languages provide explicit language support for protocols/interfaces (Ada, C#, D, Dart, Delphi, Go, Java, Logtalk, Object Pascal, Objective-C, PHP, Racket, Seed7, Swift). In C++ interfaces are known as abstract base classes, and are implemented using pure virtual functions. The object-oriented features in Perl also support interfaces.  Non-object oriented languages  Although the Go programming language is not generally considered an object-oriented language, it does allow methods to be defined on user-defined types. Go has \\"interface\\" types that are compatible with any type that supports a given set of methods (the type does not need to explicitly implement the interface). The empty interface, \`interface{}\`, is compatible with all types. Note that functional programming and distributed programming languages use the term protocol akin to the communications usage (i.e. a specification of allowed exchanges of messages, emphasis on exchanges, not on messages). In particular, the following are also considered as part of a protocol in these languages: # The allowed sequences of messages, # Restrictions placed on either participant in the communication, # Expected effects that will occur as the message is handled.

As early as the 1st century CE, Tacitus wrote that the Suiones had a king, but the order of Swedish regnal succession up until King Eric the Victorious (died 995), is known almost exclusively through accounts in historically controversial Norse sagas (see Mythical kings of Sweden and Semi-legendary kings of Sweden). Originally, the Swedish king had combined powers limited to that of a war chief, a judge and a priest at the Temple at Uppsala (see Germanic king). However, there are thousands of runestones commemorating commoners, but no known chronicle about the Swedish kings prior to the 14th century (though a list of kings was added in the Westrogothic law), and there is a relatively small number of runestones that are thought to mention kings: Gs 11 (Emund the Old ‚Äì reigned 1050‚Äì1060), U 11 (H√•kan the Red ‚Äì late 11th century) and U 861 (Blot-Sweyn ‚Äì reigned 1080). About 1000 A.D., the first king known to rule both Svealand and G√∂taland was Olof Sk√∂tkonung, but further history for the next two centuries is obscure, with many kings whose tenures and actual influence/power remains unclear. The Royal Court of Sweden, however, does count Olof's father, Eric the Victorious, as Sweden's first king. The power of the king was greatly strengthened by the introduction of Christianity during the 11th century, and the following centuries saw a process of consolidation of power into the hands of the king. The Swedes traditionally elected a king from a favored dynasty at the Stones of Mora, and the people had the right to elect the king as well as to depose him. The ceremonial stones were destroyed around 1515. In the 12th century, the consolidation of Sweden was still affected by dynastic struggles between the Erik and Sverker clans, which ended when a third clan married into the Erik clan and the House of Bjelbo was established on the throne. That dynasty formed pre-Kalmar Union Sweden into a strong state, and finally king Magnus IV (reigned 1319‚Äì1364) even ruled Norway (1319‚Äì1343) and Scania (1332‚Äì1360). Following the Black Death, the union weakened, and Scania reunited with Denmark. In 1397, after the Black Death and domestic power struggles, Queen Margaret I of Denmark united Sweden (then including Finland), Denmark and Norway (then including Iceland) in the Union of Kalmar with the approval of the Swedish nobility. Continual tension within each country and the union led to open conflict between the Swedes and the Danes in the 15th century. The union's final disintegration in the early 16th century led to prolonged rivalry between Denmark-Norway and Sweden (with Finland) for centuries to come. = 16th- and 17th-century changes = Gustav I, portrayed here in 1542 by Jakob Binck, legally created the hereditary monarchy and organized the Swedish unitary state. Catholic bishops had supported the King of Denmark, Christian II, but he was overthrown in a rebellion led by nobleman Gustav Vasa, whose father had been executed at the Stockholm bloodbath. Gustav Vasa (hereinafter referred to as Gustav I) was elected King of Sweden by the Estates of the Realm, assembled in Str√§ngn√§s on 6 June 1523. Inspired by the teachings of Martin Luther, Gustav I used the Protestant Reformation to curb the power of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1527 he persuaded the Estates of the Realm, assembled in the city of V√§ster√•s, to confiscate church lands, which comprised 21% of the country's farmland. At the same time, he broke with the papacy and established a reformed state church: the Church of Sweden. Throughout his reign, Gustav I suppressed both aristocratic and peasant opposition to his ecclesiastical policies and efforts at centralisation, which to some extent laid the foundation for the modern Swedish unitary state. Legally Sweden has only been a hereditary monarchy since 1544 when the Riksdag of the Estates, through V√§ster√•s arvf√∂rening, designated the sons of King Gustav I as the heirs to the Throne. Tax reforms took place in 1538 and 1558, whereby multiple complex taxes on independent farmers were simplified and standardised throughout the district and tax assessments per farm were adjusted to reflect ability to pay. Crown tax revenues increased, but more importantly the new system was perceived as fairer. A war with L√ºbeck in 1535 resulted in the expulsion of the Hanseatic traders, who previously had had a monopoly on foreign trade. With its own burghers in charge, Sweden's economic strength grew rapidly, and by 1544 Gustav controlled 60% of the farmlands in all of Sweden. Sweden now built the first modern army in Europe, supported by a sophisticated tax system and an efficient bureaucracy.Michael Roberts, The Early Vasas: A History of Sweden 1523‚Äì1611 (1968); Jan Glete, War and the State in Early Modern Europe: Spain, the Dutch Republic, and Sweden as Fiscal- Military States, 1500‚Äì1660 (2002) online edition At the death of King Gustav I in 1560, he was succeeded by his oldest son Eric XIV. His reign was marked by Sweden's entrance into the Livonian War and the Northern Seven Years' War. The combination of Eric's developing mental disorder and his opposition to the aristocracy led to the Sture Murders in 1567 and the imprisonment of his brother John (III), who was married to Catherine Jagiellon, sister of King Sigismund II of Poland.Article \\"Johan III\\", from Nordisk familjebok In 1568 Eric was dethroned and succeeded by John III. In domestic politics John III showed clear Catholic sympathies, inspired by his queen, creating friction with the Swedish clergy and nobility. He reintroduced several Catholic traditions previously abolished, and his foreign policy was affected by his family connection to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, where his eldest son had been made King Sigismund III in 1587. Following the death of his father, Sigismund tried to rule Sweden from Poland, leaving Sweden under the control of a regent ‚Äì his paternal uncle (Gustav I's youngest son) Charles (IX) ‚Äì but was unable to defend his Swedish throne against the ambitions of his uncle. In 1598 Sigismund and his Swedish-Polish army was defeated at the Battle of St√•ngebro by the forces of Charles, and he was declared deposed by the Estates in 1599. The Lion of the North: King Gustavus Adolphus depicted at the turning point of the Battle of Breitenfeld (1631) against the forces of Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. In 1604, the Estates finally recognized the regent and de facto ruler as King Charles IX. His short reign was one of uninterrupted warfare. The hostility of Poland and the breakup of Russia involved him in overseas contests for the possession of Livonia and Ingria, the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War (1600‚Äì1611) and the Ingrian War, while his pretensions to claim Lapland brought on a war with Denmark (Kalmar War) in the last year of his reign. Gustavus Adolphus inherited three wars from his father when he ascended to the throne. From 1612, when Count Axel Oxenstierna was appointed Lord High Chancellor, which he remained until Gustavus Adolphus's death, the two men struck a long and successful partnership and complemented each other well: In Oxenstierna's own words, his \\"cool\\" balanced the King's \\"heat\\". The war against Russia (the Ingrian War) ended in 1617 with the Treaty of Stolbovo, which excluded Russia from the Baltic Sea. The final inherited war, the war against Poland, ended in 1629 with the Truce of Altmark, which transferred the large province of Livonia to Sweden and freed the Swedish forces for subsequent intervention in the Thirty Years' War in Germany, where Swedish forces had already established a bridgehead in 1628. Brandenburg was torn apart by a quarrel between the Protestants and the Catholics. When Gustavus Adolphus began his push into northern (Germany) in June‚ÄìJuly 1630, he had just 4,000 troops. But he was soon able to consolidate the Protestant position in the north, using reinforcements from Sweden and money supplied by France at the Treaty of B√§rwalde. Referring to Gustavus Adolphus was killed at the 1632 Battle of L√ºtzen. Queen Maria Eleonora and the king's ministers took over the government of the Realm on behalf of Gustavus Adolphus' underage daughter Christina, until she reached the age of majority. Gustavus Adolphus is often regarded by military historians as one of the greatest military commanders of all time, with innovative use of combined arms. As the heiress presumptive, at the age of six Christina succeeded her father on the Swedish throne (being the only person left in the line of succession), although a regency government would rule in her name until she turned 18 years of age. During the regency, Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna wrote the 1634 Instrument of Government, which although never approved by any monarch, nevertheless would continue to have an important normative role in the state administration. Christina early on showed an interest in literature and the sciences and famously brought Ren√© Descartes to Sweden. Sweden continued to be involved in the Thirty Years' War during reign of Christina and that conflict was settled at the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, and the Swedish monarch received representation at the Imperial Diet due to the German conquests (Bremen-Verden and Swedish Pomerania) that were made. After having decided not to get married, Christina abdicated the throne on 5 June 1654, in favor of her cousin Charles Gustav, went abroad and converted to Roman Catholicism. Charles XI at the Battle of Lund in 1676. Painting by David Kl√∂cker Ehrenstrahl. The Estates elected Charles X Gustav as their new King and his short reign is best characterized by foreign wars: first a lengthy campaign within Poland and then with Denmark. In the latter case, the risky 1658 March across the Belts which resulted in the Treaty of Roskilde, would prove to be the largest permanent territorial gain Sweden ever had: Sk√•ne, Blekinge and Bohusl√§n now became Swedish provinces and have remained so ever since. Charles X Gustav was not satisfied, as he wanted to crush Denmark once and for all, but the 1659 Assault on Copenhagen did not prove successful for the Swedes, much of it due to the Dutch naval intervention to the aid of the Danes. Charles X Gustav died in Gothenburg in 1660 and as the Crown passed to his five-year-old son Charles XI, a new regency government would assume the responsibilities of the state. The regency government, composed of aristocrats and led by Chancellor Count Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie, was more interested in feathering their own nests rather than to work in the interest of the country at large. When Charles XI came of age in 1672, the effectiveness of the armed forces had seriously deteriorated and the country was ill-prepared as the King of Denmark, Christian V, invaded to settle old scores. The Danes were ultimately unsuccessful in their attempts, and Charles XI would undertake several measures to prevent what had just almost happened from occurring again: reducing the influence of the aristocracy by nationalizing estates and properties which had been handed out to them by his predecessors, introducing the Allotment system () which would form the basis of the armed forces until the 20th century, and with the support of the Estates he was declared in 1680 an absolute monarch. Charles XI was succeeded by his son, Charles XII, who would prove to be an extremely able military commander, defeating far larger enemies with the small but highly professional Swedish army. His defeat of the Russians at Narva when just 18 years old was to be his greatest victory. However his campaigning at the head of his army during the Great Northern War would ultimately lead to catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Poltava after which he spent several years in Turkey (now Moldova). Some years later he was killed at the Siege of Fredriksten during an attempt to invade Norway. The Swedish Age of Greatness () had ended. =18th century to the present= Charles XII's sister, Ulrika Eleonora, had now inherited the throne but she was forced by the Estates to sign the 1719 Instrument of Government, which ended the absolute monarchy and made the Riksdag of the Estates the highest organ of the state and reduced the role of monarch to a figurehead. The Age of Liberty () with its parliamentary rule, dominated by two parties ‚Äì the Caps and the Hats ‚Äì had begun. Ulrika Eleonora had had enough after a year on the throne and abdicated in favor of her husband, Frederick, who had little interest in the affairs of state and was elected King by the Estates as King Frederick I, resulting in the 1720 Instrument of Government: content-wise almost identical to the one from 1719. Despite having many extra-marital affairs, Frederick I never sired a legitimate heir to the throne. The 1720 Instrument in Government was later replaced by the 1772 Instrument of Government in a self-coup orchestrated by King Gustav III. Charles John at the Battle of Leipzig (1813). Painting by Fredric Westin. On 17 September 1809 in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, as a result of the poorly managed Finnish War, Sweden had to surrender Finland to Russia. King Gustav IV Adolf and his descendants were deposed in a coup d'√©tat led by dissatisfied army officers. The childless uncle of the former king was almost immediately elected as King Charles XIII. The Instrument of Government of 1809 put an end to royal absolutism by dividing the legislative power between the Riksdag (primary) and the king (secondary), and vested executive power in the king when acting through the Council of State. The present Bernadotte dynasty was established in September 1810 when the Riksdag, convened in √ñrebro, elected French Marshal and Prince of Pontecorvo Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte as crown prince. This took place because Charles XIII had no legitimate heir, and a crown prince previously elected in January 1810, Charles August, suddenly had died of a stroke during a military exercise. Although the 19th century Bernadotte monarchs that would follow Charles XIV John's reign tried to defend the power and privileges they still had, the tide incrementally turned against \\"personal regal rule\\" () with the growth of the liberals, social democrats, and the expansion of the franchise.Larsson & B√§ck: pp. 66‚Äì67. When King Gustav V publicly objected to the defence budget cuts made by Prime Minister Karl Staaf and the cabinet just before the First World War in event known as the Courtyard Crisis accompanied by the Peasant armament support march (), it was seen as a deliberate provocation by conservatives and reactionaries against the uncodified norm of a parliamentary system supported by the liberals and the social democrats, leading to Staaf's resignation.Larsson & B√§ck: pp. 67‚Äì68. Gustaf V then appointed a caretaker government, supported by the conservatives, led by legal scholar Hjalmar Hammarskj√∂ld, which remained in power longer than expected due to the outbreak of World War I (in which Sweden remained neutral) and increased defence spending was no longer a controversial issue.Larsson & B√§ck: pp. 68‚Äì69. Nevertheless, in the year of the outbreak of the Russian revolution, social tensions continued to rise; the general election in 1917 gave the liberals and social democrats greatly strengthened representation in both Riksdag chambers and a conservative government was no longer a defensible option. Following the definite breakthrough of parliamentarism in 1917, with the appointment of the coalition government of liberals and social democrats led by Professor Nils Ed√©n, the political influence of the King was considerably reduced and an unwritten constitutional precedent was set that would remain in effect until 1975.Larsson & B√§ck: pp. 66‚Äì69.Lewin: pp. 112‚Äì115. Only during World War II, in the so-called Midsummer crisis (regarding the issue whether neutral Sweden should permit rail transport of German troops from Norway passing through to Finland), did Gustaf V allegedly try to intervene in the political process by threatening to abdicate.Larsson & B√§ck: p. 72. King Gustaf VI Adolf succeeded his elderly father who died in 1950, and he is generally regarded as a constitutional monarch who stayed out of politics and controversy. In 1954, a royal commission began work on whether Sweden should undergo constitutional reform to adapt the 1809 Instrument of Government to current political realities, or whether a new one should be written; ultimately the latter idea was chosen. The future role of the monarchy was settled in a manner well known within Swedish political discourse: a political compromise reached at the summer resort Torekov in 1971 (hence known as the Torekov compromise, ) by representatives of four of the parties in the Riksdag (the Social Democrats, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party, and the Moderate Party, that is all the parties except the Communists). It mandated that the monarchy would remain largely as it was but would become entirely ceremonial, without any residual political powers left.Torbj√∂rn Bergman (1999). \\"Trade-offs in Swedish Constitutional design: The Monarchy Under Challenge\\". In Wolfgang C. M√ºller and Kaare Str√∏m, eds., Policy? Office?, or Votes? How Political Parties Make Hard Choices. Cambridge University Press. . Following the required double Riksdag votes that took place in 1973 and 1974, a new Instrument of Government was brought into effect. The monarch's functions and duties, as defined in the 1974 Constitution Act, include heading the special cabinet council held when there is a change of government, but no executive powers with respect to the governance of the realm are vested in him. Carl XVI Gustaf became king on 15 September 1973 on the death of his grandfather Gustaf VI Adolf and because of his father's early death has become the longest reigning monarch in Swedish history. Constitutional and official role When, on 1 January 1975, it replaced the Instrument of Government of 1809 as part of the Constitution of Sweden, the Instrument of Government of 1974 () transformed the advisory Council of State () into the collegial Government (), to which all executive power was transferred.Nergelius: pp. 15‚Äì16.Nergelius: pp. 33‚Äì34. Responsibility for nominating and dismissing the prime minister (who, since 1975, is elected by the Riksdag) was transferred to the Speaker of the Riksdag; the prime minister appoints and dismisses the other ministers at his or her discretion.Larsson & B√§ck: pp. 166‚Äì170. Furthermore, bills passed by the Riksdag become law without royal assent: the prime minister or any other cabinet minister signs them \\"On Behalf of the Government\\" (). Although the unwritten precedent was set in 1917, when Gustaf V had little choice but to support the idea of a parliamentary system and promised Prime Minister Nils Ed√©n to stop seeking advice from secret advisors other than the duly appointed cabinet ministers and not to interfere in politics again;Larsson & B√§ck: pp. 65‚Äì69. the Torekov compromise, struck in 1971 by the four major parties at the time, provided, and continues to provide, a majority consensus in Swedish political discourse on the role of the monarchy within the constitutional framework.Nergelius: p. 41. The official motive for the radical changes which came to pass in 1975 was for it to be as descriptive as possible of the workings of the state and clear on how decisions actually are made. Minister of Justice Lennart Geijer further remarked on the 1973 government bill that any continued pretensions of royal involvement in government decision making would be of a \\"fictitious nature\\" and therefore \\"highly unsatisfactory\\". Thus, the monarch lost all formal executive powers, becoming a ceremonial and representative figurehead.Prop. 1973:90. Kungl. Maj:ts proposition med f√∂rslag till ny regeringsform och ny riksdagsordning m. m.; given Stockholms slott den 16 mars 1973. p. 172-175.Larsson & B√§ck: p. 166. The monarch, while explicitly referred to as the \\"Head of State\\" () in the 1974 Instrument of Government, is not even the nominal chief executive.Petersson: p. 44. The Instrument of Government of 1974 does grant the person serving as king or queen regnant absolute immunity from criminal (but not civil) charges for as long as he or she remains in office. The monarch therefore cannot be prosecuted or otherwise held to account for his or her actions, both official and private, in judicial proceedings.Nergelius: p. 42. None of the other members of the Royal Family or the employees the Royal Court enjoy similar immunity. At the request of the Speaker of the Riksdag, the monarch opens the annual session of the Riksdag () in the chamber of the Riksdag building. The king or queen regnant also receives Letters of Credence of foreign ambassadors sent to Sweden and signs those of Swedish ambassadors sent abroad. The monarch also chairs the Cabinet Council () in a session that establishes the new government following a general election or major cabinet reshuffle and also chairs information councils () approximately four times a year to get information from the assembled Government, apart from that given by ministers in individual audiences or through other means.Nergelius: pp. 41‚Äì42. Formally, it is the explicit responsibility of the prime minister to keep the monarch informed on the affairs of the realm; the failure to do so following the 2004 tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean (in which many Swedes perished) gave rise to wide criticism of Prime Minister G√∂ran Persson for his handling of the matter. The monarch also chairs the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs (), a body that enables the government of the day to inform not only the head of state, but also the speaker and representatives of the opposition parties in the Riksdag, on foreign affairs issues in a confidential manner. While the monarch is no longer the commander-in-chief () of the Swedish Armed Forces, as he once was under the 1809 Instrument of Government (and much older custom, as shown in the history section), King Carl XVI Gustaf is the foremost representative of the Swedish defence establishment and holds supreme rank in each of the service arms. He ranks as a four star admiral in the Swedish Navy and general in the Swedish Army and Air Force. As part of his court, the monarch has a military staff, which is headed by a senior officer (usually a general or admiral, retired from active service) and includes active duty military officers serving as aides-de-camp to the monarch and his or her family. Cultural role The monarch and members of the Royal Family undertake a variety of official, unofficial and other representative duties within Sweden and abroad. The monarch and his or her family play a central role in state visits to Sweden and conduct state visits to other nations on behalf of Sweden. Other members of the Royal Family may also represent the country abroad at lesser functions. The royal standard used by the monarch Many of the flag days in Sweden have direct royal connections; among them are the name days of the King (28 January), the Queen (8 August), and the Crown Princess (12 March); the birthdays of the King (30 April), the Queen (23 December), and the Crown Princess (14 July); and Gustavus Adolphus Day (), on 6 November, in memory of King Gustavus Adolphus, who was killed on that date (old style) in 1632 in the Battle of L√ºtzen. None of these flag days are public holidays, however. Perhaps the most globally known ceremony in which the Royal Family annually participate is the Nobel Prize award ceremony held at the Stockholm Concert Hall (and the subsequent banquet in the Stockholm City Hall), where the monarch hands out the Nobel Prizes on behalf of the Nobel Foundation for outstanding contributions to mankind in physics, chemistry, literature, physiology or medicine, and the economic sciences.Levinovitz, pp. 21‚Äì23 Eriksgata was the name of the traditional journey of newly elected medieval Swedish kings through important provinces to have their election confirmed by local Things. The actual election took place at the Stone of Mora in Uppland and participation was originally restricted to the people of that area; hence, the need of having the election confirmed by the other parts of the realm. The Eriksgata gradually lost its importance when, as of the 14th century, representatives of other parts of Sweden began to participate in the election. After 1544, when hereditary monarchy was instituted, that meant that the Eriksgata had little practical importance. The last king to travel the Eriksgata according to the old tradition was Charles IX, whose reign began in 1604. Later, kings, up until present times, have made visits to all the Swedish provinces and called them an Eriksgata, while those visits bear little resemblance to the medieval tradition. Titles The Silver Throne, used by all Swedish monarchs from Queen Christina in 1650 onward =Monarch= The full title of the Swedish monarch from 1544 to 1973 included: :In (By the Grace of God, King of the Swedes, the Goths/Geats, and the Wends) :In Sometimes the first part of the Latin title was or , all three words meaning \\"of the Swedes\\", not \\"of Sweden\\". (King of the Goths) dated back at least to Kings Magnus III, Erik the Saint, and Charles VII (and possibly to Inge the Elder, the title being used in a letter to Inge from the Pope). The title (King of the Swedes) dated to an older era. In the 16th century, it was changed to or (King of Sweden), a short form of the title that came be used sometimes in less formal circumstances. Before the accession of the first king of the House of Bernadotte, Charles XIV John, in 1818, the King of Sweden had many other titles relating to the wider Swedish Empire: :Grand Prince of Finland, Duke of Scania, Estonia, Livonia, Karelia, Bremen, Verden, Stettin, Pomerania, Kashubia and Wendia, Prince of R√ºgen, Lord of Ingria and Wismar, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, J√ºlich, Cleves and Berg. During the reign of the House of Holstein-Gottorp from 1751 to 1818, the title Heir to Norway () was also used,See the preamble to the Act of Succession. as well as other titles connected to the Dukes of Holstein-Gottorp. When, after the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was in personal union with Sweden, the title included King of Norway, in older Swedish spellings: . Upon his accession, Carl XVI Gustaf chose for his title simply (King of Sweden). SFS (1973:702) This was reflected in his personal motto (\\"For Sweden, with the times\\"). Queen Margrethe II of Denmark did the same in 1972 and, similarly, Harald V of Norway bears no titles except King of Norway. =Dynasts= The customary title of the heir apparent is crown prince (kronprins) or crown princess (kronprinsessa). The wife of a crown prince would also receive a corresponding title, but not the husband of a crown princess. The traditional official title used until 1980 for other dynastic male heirs was hereditary prince (arvfurste), although the word prince (prins) was used in constitutional legal texts such as the Act of Succession and also colloquially and informally. Female dynasts are titled princess (prinsessa). The Swedish Succession Act was altered in 1980 to allow for female succession to the throne. =Ducal titles= King Gustav III revived a tradition from the time of Gustav Vasa and the medieval era by giving male heirs to the throne ducal titles of Swedish provinces. The difference between the ducal titles from the Vasa era and those granted by Gustav III is they now are non-hereditary courtesy titles given at birth. Since 1980, they have been conferred to all royal heirs, male and female. The wives of royal dukes have always shared their husbands' titles; the husbands of royal duchesses have done so as of 2010.  Symbols of the monarchy = Regalia = The Crown of Eric XIV. The regalia of Sweden are kept deep in the vaults of the Treasury chamber (), located underneath the Royal Palace in Stockholm, in a museum which has been open to the public since 1970. Among the oldest objects in the collection are the sword of Gustav Vasa and the crown, orb, sceptre and key of King Erik XIV. The Regalia is state property and the government authority which holds it in trust is the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency. The last king to have been crowned was Oscar II. His son and successor, Gustaf V, abstained from having a coronation. While the crowns and coronets have not been worn by Swedish royalty since 1907, they are nevertheless still displayed on royal occasions such as at weddings, christenings and funerals. Until 1974, the crown and sceptre were also displayed on cushions beside the Silver Throne at the annual solemn opening of the Riksdag (). = Royal orders of chivalry = The Royal Orders of Sweden constituting the Royal Order of Knights The Royal orders have a historical basis, dating back to the 1606 founding of the now extinct Jehova Order. The Royal Orders of Knights of Sweden were only truly codified in the 18th century, with their formal foundation in 1748 by King Frederick I. In 1974 the Riksdag significantly changed the conditions and criteria under which orders and decorations could be awarded: that no Swedish citizen outside the Royal Family is eligible to receive such decorations. The Order of the Seraphim () is only awarded to foreign heads of state and members of the Swedish and foreign royal families, while the Order of the Polar Star () can be bestowed on any non-Swedish citizen.Orders, Swedish Royal Court, date accessed 2014-10-22. Following the reforms, the Order of the Sword () and the Order of Vasa () are no longer conferred: officially they have been declared as \\"dormant\\". Since 1975, H. M. The King's Medal () is the highest honour that can be awarded to Swedish citizens other than members of the Royal Family. = Royal residences = The Royal Palaces (including the Royal Palace in Stockholm, Drottningholm Palace, Haga Palace, Rosendal Palace, Ulriksdal Palace, Rosersberg Palace, Tullgarn Palace and Gripsholm Castle) are government property, managed by the National Property Board () and are at the disposal of the Monarch, an arrangement that has been in place since the beginning of the 19th century. There are also residences which are held privately by the Royal Family, such as Solliden Palace on the island of √ñland, a cottage in Storlien in the J√§mtland and Villa Mirage in Sainte-Maxime in southern France (originally acquired by Prince Bertil).  Royal Palace  Royal Palace in Stockholm, as seen from the tower of the Cathedral The Royal Palace (), also known as Stockholm Palace (), is the official residence of the king. The Royal Palace is located on Stadsholmen (\\"City Island\\"), commonly known as Gamla Stan (\\"the Old Town\\") in the national capital city Stockholm. The offices of the king, other members of the Swedish Royal Family, and the offices of the Royal Court are located in the palace. The Royal Palace is used for representative purposes and State occasions by the king. The Royal Palace is guarded by H√∂gvakten, a royal guard, consisting of regular service members of the Swedish Armed Forces. The tradition of having a regular unit of the Army guarding at the royal residence dates back to 1523. Until the mid-19th century, the royal guards also maintained law and order in the city and provided firefighting services. Tre Kronor, located on the site of today's palace, in a painting from 1661 by Govert Dircksz Camphuysen. The southern fa√ßade faces the grand style slope Slottsbacken; the eastern fa√ßade borders Skeppsbron, a quay which passes along the eastern waterfront of the old town; on the northern front Lejonbacken is a system of ramps named for the Medici lions, sculptures on the stone railings; and the western wings border the open space H√∂gvaktsterrassen. The Royal Palace in Stockholm is unique among European royal residences in that large portions of it are open year-round to visitors, who pay entrance fees. The first building on this site was a fortress with a core tower built in the 13th century by Birger Jarl to defend the entry into Lake M√§laren. The fortress gradually grew to a castle, known as Tre Kronor: named after the spire on the centre tower with Three Crowns, which have become the Swedish national symbol. In the late 16th century, work was done to transform the castle into a Renaissance palace during the reign of John III. In 1690, it was decided that the castle be rebuilt in Baroque style in a design by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. In 1692, work began on the northern row. However, much of the old castle was destroyed in a disastrous fire on 7 May 1697. Tessin rebuilt the damaged palace, and work continued for another 63 years. Semicirclular wings around the outer western courtyard were finished in 1734, the palace church was finished in the 1740s, and the exterior was finished in 1754. The royal family moved to the palace with the southwest, southeast, and northeast wings finished. The northwest wing was finished in 1760. In the north, Lejonbacken (the \\"Lion's Slope\\") was rebuilt from 1824 to 1830.  Drottningholm Palace  Drottningholm Palace, a UNESCO World Heritage site is the home residence of the King & Queen. Drottningholm Palace () is located at Drottningholm on the island of Lov√∂n (in Eker√∂ Municipality of Stockholm County), and is one of Sweden's Royal Palaces. It was originally built in the late 16th century. It has served as a residence of the Swedish royal family members for most of the 18th and 19th centuries. Apart from being the current private residence of the King and Queen, Drottningholm Palace is a popular tourist attraction. The gardens and park areas surrounding Drottningholm Palace and adjacent to its buildings are one of the main attractions for the tourists that visit the palace each year. The gardens have been established in stages since the palace was first built, resulting in many different styles. The royal domain of Drottningholm is a well-preserved milieu from the 17th and 18th centuries, inspired by French buildings such as the Chateau of Versailles, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, principally because of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre and the Chinese Pavilion at Drottningholm. It was added to the World Heritage List in 1991.  Haga Palace  Haga Palace is the residence of Crown Princess Victoria and her family. Haga Palace (), formerly known as the Queen's Pavilion (), is located in the Haga Park, Solna Municipality in Metropolitan Stockholm. The palace, built between 18021805, was modelled after balletmaster Louis Gallodier's Italian villa at Drottningholm by architect Carl Christoffer Gj√∂rwell on appointment by King Gustaf IV Adolf for the royal children. It has been the home or summer house of several members of the Swedish royal family ‚Äì notably it was the birthplace of the present King Carl XVI Gustaf ‚Äì until 1966 when King Gustaf VI Adolf transferred its disposal to the prime minister and it was turned into a guest house for distinguished foreign official visitors (heads of state and heads of government et cetera). In April 2009, it was announced by Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt that the rights of disposal of the palace would be transferred back to the King and thus could be used by Crown Princess Victoria and her husband, Prince Daniel, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland. They moved into the palace in the autumn after their wedding on 19 June 2010.  Royal Family  The Swedish Royal Family is, according to the Royal Court, currently categorized into three groups; * first, those with royal titles and style (manner of address) who perform official and unofficial engagements for the nation, are the members of the Royal Family () (currently this category only includes the King, Queen and their descendants, including spouses); * second, those with royal titles and style (manner of address) who perform no official engagements (, usually stylized with the shortform Kungl. Huset); * and third, the extended family of the King (, usually stylized with the shortform Kungl. Familjens √∂vriga medlemmar) which is other close relatives who are not dynasts and thus do not represent the country officially. However, in any case, there is no legislation or other public document which delineates the rules of membership in either the Royal House or Royal Family, as it is left to the sole discretion of the King. = The line of succession = 2010 royal wedding. The Act of Succession of 1810 provides the rules governing the line of succession and designates the legitimate heirs to the Swedish Throne; it also states in article 4 that the Monarch and dynastic members of the Royal House must at all times be a Protestant Christian of the pure evangelical faith (by implication the Church of Sweden).Nergelius: pp. 42‚Äì44. A rewrite of the Act, entering into force in 1980, fundamentally changed the rules of succession from agnatic primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. This allowed for the crown to pass to the eldest child regardless of gender and thus retroactively installed Princess Victoria as crown princess over her younger brother, Prince Carl Philip, who had been born as crown prince a few months before. In its present reading, Article 1 of the Act of Succession limits the potential number of claimants to the throne, so that only the descendants of Carl XVI Gustaf can inherit the Throne.See Act of Succession, Article 1. If the royal house were to be extinct, the Riksdag is not obligated to elect a new royal house, as it once was up until the constitutional reforms of the 1970s.

A parabolic microphone is a microphone that uses a parabolic reflector to collect and focus sound waves onto a transducer, in much the same way that a parabolic antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Though they lack high fidelity, parabolic microphones have great sensitivity to sounds in one direction, along the axis of the dish, and can pick up distant sounds. Typical uses of this microphone include nature sound recording such as recording bird calls, field audio for sports broadcasting, and eavesdropping on conversations, for example in espionage and law enforcement. Parabolic microphones were used in many parts of the world as early as World War II, especially by the Japanese. A Sony parabolic reflector, without a microphone. The microphone would face the reflector surface and sound captured by the reflector would bounce towards the microphone. Limitations Parabolic microphones are generally not used for high fidelity applications because dishes small enough to be portable have poor low-frequency response. This is because, from the Rayleigh criterion, parabolic dishes can only focus waves with a wavelength much smaller than the diameter of their aperture. The wavelength of sound waves at the low end of human hearing (20 Hz) is about ; focusing them would require a dish much larger than this. A typical parabolic microphone dish with a diameter of one metre has little directivity for sound waves longer than 30 cm, corresponding to frequencies below 1 kHz. For higher frequencies, a gain of about 15 dB can be expected, however, when the wavelength of the sound becomes comparable with the diameter of the parabolic dish the response falls away. A shotgun microphone, or a phased array of microphones, may be used as an alternative for applications requiring directional selectivity with high fidelity.

It is an expected or free or continuously changing behavior and may have a given individual social status or social position. It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist understandings of society. Social role posits the following about social behavior: # The division of labor in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, we call roles. # Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behavior and actions that recur in a group, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behavior in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society. # Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called actors. #When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role legitimate and constructive), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms. # Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change. # The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving prosocially, account for why agents conform to role requirements. The notion of the role can and is examined in the social sciences, more specifically economics, sociology and organization theory.  Definition  Stanley Wasserman and Katherine Faust Stanley cautioned that \\"there is considerable disagreement among social scientists about the definitions of the related concepts of social position, social status, and social role.\\" They note that while many scholars differentiate those terms, they can define those terms in a way that clashes with the definitions of another scholar; for example they state that \\"[Ralph] Linton uses the term 'status' in a way that is identical to our use of the term \\"position\\". Determinants and characteristics Roles may be achieved or ascribed or they can be accidental in different situations. An achieved role is a position that a person assumes voluntarily which reflects personal skills, abilities, and effort. An ascribed role is a position assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, and is usually forced upon a person. Roles can be semi-permanent (\\"doctor\\", \\"mother\\", \\"child\\"), or they can be transitory. A well-known example is the sick role as formulated by Talcott Parsons in the late 1940s. In the transitory \\"sick role\\", a person is exempted from their usual roles, but is expected to conform to transitory behavioral standards, such as following doctors' orders and trying to recover. For many roles, individuals must meet certain conditions, biological or sociological. For instance, a boy cannot ordinarily take the biological role of mother. Other roles require training or experience. For instance, in many cultures doctors must be educated and certified before practicing medicine. Role development can be influenced by a number of additional factors, including social, genetic predisposition, cultural or situational. *Societal influence: The structure of society often forms individuals into certain roles based on the social situations they choose to experience. Parents enrolling their children in certain programs at a young age increases the chance that the child will follow that role. *Genetic predisposition: People take on roles that come naturally to them. Those with athletic ability generally take on roles of athletes. Those with mental genius often take on roles devoted to education and knowledge. This does not mean that people must choose only one path, each individual can reprise multiple roles (i.e. Evelyn can be the point guard on the basketball team and the editor of her school newspaper). *Cultural influence: Different cultures place different values on certain roles based on their lifestyle. For instance, soccer players are regarded higher in European countries than in the United States, where soccer is less popular. *Situational influence: Roles can be created or altered based on the situation a person is put in outside their own influence. An example of this is students blaming failure on situational factors like \\"the test wasn't fair\\" and this effects their role as a student. Roles are also frequently interconnected in a role set, that complement of role-relationships in which persons are involved by virtue of occupying a particular social status. For example, a high school football player carries the roles of student, athlete, classmate, etc. Another example of a role is \\"an individual in the role of a parent is expected to care for their child and protect them from harm\\".  Role theory  Role theory is the sociological study of role development, concerned with explaining what forces cause people to develop the expectations of their own and others' behaviors. According to sociologist Bruce Biddle (1986), the five major models of role theory include: #Functional Role Theory, which examines role development as shared social norms for a given social position, #Symbolic Interactionist Role Theory, which examines role development as the outcome of individual interpretation of responses to behavior, #Structural Role Theory, which emphasises the influence of society rather than the individual in roles and utilizes mathematical models, #Organizational Role Theory, which examines role development in organizations, and #Cognitive Role Theory, which is summarized by Flynn and Lemay as \\"the relationship between expectations and behaviors\\" =Role in functionalist and consensus theory= The functionalist approach to role theory, which is largely borrowed from anthropology, sees a \\"role\\" as the set of expectations that society places on an individual. By unspoken consensus, certain behaviors are deemed \\"appropriate\\" and others \\"inappropriate\\". For example, an appropriate doctor dresses fairly conservatively, asks a series of personal questions about one's health, touches one in ways that would normally be forbidden, writes prescriptions, and shows more concern for the personal wellbeing of his or her clients than is expected of, say, an electrician or a shopkeeper. \\"Role\\" is what the doctor does (or, at least, is expected to do) while status is what the doctor is; in other words, \\"status\\" is the position an actor occupies, while \\"role\\" is the expected behavior attached to that position. Roles are not limited to occupational status, of course, nor does the fact that one is cast in the role of \\"doctor\\" during working hours prevent one from taking on other roles at other times: husband/wife, friend, father/mother, and so on. =Role in interactionist or social action theory= In interactionist social theory, the concept of role is crucial. The interactionist definition of \\"role\\" pre-dates the functionalist one. A role, in this conception, is not fixed or prescribed but something that is constantly negotiated between individuals in a tentative, creative way. Philosopher George Herbert Mead explored roles in his seminal 1934 work, Mind, self and society. Mead's main interest was the way in which children learn how to become a part of society by imaginative role-taking, observing and mimicking others. This is always done in an interactive way: it's not meaningful to think of a role for one person alone, only for that person as an individual who is both co-operating and competing with others. Adults behave similarly: taking roles from those that they see around them, adapting them in creative ways, and (by the process of social interaction) testing them and either confirming them or modifying them. This can be most easily seen in encounters where there is considerable ambiguity, but is nevertheless something that is part of all social interactions: each individual actively tries to \\"define the situation\\" (understand their role within it); choose a role that is advantageous or appealing; play that role; and persuade others to support the role. =Social norms theory= Social norms theory states that much of people's behavior is influenced by their perception of how other members of their social group behave. When individuals are in a state of deindividuation, they see themselves only in terms of group identity, and their behavior is likely to be guided by group norms alone. But while group norms have a powerful effect on behavior, they can only guide behavior when they are activated by obvious reminders or by subtle cues. People adhere to social norms through enforcement, internalization, the sharing of norms by other group members, and frequent activation. Norms can be enforced through punishment or reward. Individuals are rewarded for living up to their roles (i.e. students getting an \\"A\\" on their exam) or punished for not completing the duties of their role (i.e. a salesman is fired for not selling enough product). Social norm theory has been applied as an environmental approach, with an aim of influencing individuals by manipulating their social and cultural environments. It has been widely applied using social marketing techniques. Normative messages are designed for delivery using various media and promotional strategies in order to effectively reach a target population. Social norms theory has also been successfully applied through strategies such as curriculum infusion, creating press coverage, policy development, and small group inventions.(Main Frame 2002) The theory of planned behavior People display reactance by fighting against threats to their freedom of action when they find norms inappropriate. Attitudes and norms typically work together to influence behavior (directly or indirectly). The theory of planned behavior intentions are a function of three factors: attitudes about the behavior, social norms relevant to the behavior, and perceptions of control over the behavior. When attitudes and norms disagree, their influence on behaviour will depend on their relative accessibility. Team role theory As described in Working in Groups by Engleberg and Wynn, team role theory is when \\"members assume roles that are compatible with their personal characteristics and skills\\". Meredith Belbin, a psychologist, first explored the concept of team-role theory in the 1970s when he and his research team went about observing teams and wanted to find out what made teams work and what did not. According to Belbin and his research team \\"the research revealed that the difference between success and failure for a team was not dependent on factors such as intellect, but more on behavior\\".(Belbin) They began to identify separate clusters of behaviors and found that behavior was more influential on a team than anything else. These separate clusters of behaviors are known as the \\"Team Roles\\". The nine \\"team roles\\" are as follows: coordinator/chairperson, shaper, innovator, resource investigator, monitor/evaluator, implementer, teamworker, completer/finisher, and specialist.  Role conflict  There are situations where the prescribed sets of behavior that characterise roles may lead to cognitive dissonance in individuals. Role conflict is a special form of social conflict that takes place when one is forced to take on two different and incompatible roles at the same time. An example of role conflict is a father, who is a baseball coach, that is torn between his role as a father by wanting to let his son be the pitcher and his role as a coach who should let the more experienced pitcher play.  Role confusion  Role confusion occurs in a situation where an individual has trouble determining which role he or she should play, but where the roles are not necessarily incompatible. For example, if a college student attending a social function encounters his teacher as a fellow guest, he will have to determine whether to relate to the teacher as a student or a peer.  Role enhancement  Role enhancement or role enrichment refers to a situation in which roles which are held by a person are compatible and moreover enacting one role has beneficial spillover effects on the enactment of the other role. An example of role enhancement is a nurse who assists a patient in improving relationships by \\"clarifying and supplementing specific role behaviors\\". Some evidence indicates that role conflict and role enhancement can occur simultaneously, and further evidence suggests that mental health correlates with low role conflict and high role enhancement. Also certain personality traits, in particular traits linked to perceiving and seeking greater levels of support, are associated with lower inter-role conflict and increase inter-role enrichment.  Role strain  Role strain is \\"the incompatibility among roles corresponding to a single status\\". An example of role strain is \\"a student who is torn between the obligations of school, their parents, and their job\\". This is role strain because the status of being a student comes with multiple responsibilities that make it difficult to handle all at the same time.  Gender roles  Gender roles are \\"sets of behavioral norms assumed to accompany one's status as male or female\\". Gender roles are \\"one of the most popular strains of thought to evolve from role theory\\" because it can be applied to one's status as a male or female in everyday life. It has been argued that gender \\"constitutes as a master status\\" because the status of gender holds a power in society. An example of gender role is baby boys being associated with the color blue and baby girls being associated with the color pink. As people get older, women are traditionally assigned the role of being a stay at home mom and men are assigned the role of being the breadwinner of the family.

It was directed by Michael Anderson. The film recreates the true story of Operation Chastise when in 1943 the RAF's 617 Squadron attacked the M√∂hne, Eder, and Sorpe dams in Nazi Germany with Barnes Wallis's bouncing bomb. The film was based on the books The Dam Busters (1951) by Paul Brickhill and Enemy Coast Ahead (1946) by Guy Gibson. The film's reflective last minutes convey the poignant mix of emotions felt by the characters ‚Äì triumph over striking a successful blow against the enemy's industrial base is tempered by the sobering knowledge that many died in the process of delivering it. The film was widely praised and became the most popular motion picture at British cinemas in 1955. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted The Dam Busters the 68th greatest British film of the 20th century.British Film Institute ‚Äì Top 100 British Films (1999). Retrieved August 27, 2016 Its depiction of the raid, along with a similar sequence in the film 633 Squadron, provided the inspiration for the Death Star trench run in Star Wars: A New Hope. A remake has been in development since 2008, but has yet to be produced . Plot In early 1942, aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis is struggling to develop a means of attacking Germany's dams in the hope of crippling German heavy industry. Working for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, as well as his own job at Vickers, he works feverishly to make practical his theory of a bouncing bomb which would skip over the water to avoid protective torpedo nets. When it hit the dam, backspin would make it sink whilst retaining contact with the wall, making the explosion far more destructive. Wallis calculates that the aircraft will have to fly extremely low () to enable the bombs to skip over the water correctly, but when he takes his conclusions to the Ministry, he is told that lack of production capacity means they cannot go ahead with his proposals. Angry and frustrated, Wallis secures an interview with Sir Arthur \\"Bomber\\" Harris (played by Basil Sydney), the head of RAF Bomber Command, who at first is reluctant to take the idea seriously. Eventually, however, he is convinced and takes the idea to the Prime Minister, who authorises the project. Bomber Command forms a special squadron of Lancaster bombers, 617 Squadron, to be commanded by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, and tasked to fly the mission. He recruits experienced crews, especially those with low-altitude flight experience. While they train for the mission, Wallis continues his development of the bomb but has problems, such as the bomb breaking apart upon hitting the water. This requires the drop altitude to be reduced to . With only a few weeks to go, he succeeds in fixing the problems and the mission can go ahead. The bombers attack the dams. Eight Lancasters and their crews are lost, but two dams are breached and the overall mission succeeds.

The company's production manager was, however, of the opinion that, due to its numerous personnel and raids, it would not be able to film the book in its entirety. As a result, Clark requested that Brickhill provide a film treatment which described his vision for the film. Brickhill agree to do it without payment in the hope of selling the film rights. To assist him, Clark teamed him up with Walter Mycroft who was the company's director of production.Dando-Collins. p. 237. Brickhill decided to concentrate the film treatment on Operation Chastise and ignore the later raids. After the Air Ministry agreed to make available four Lancaster bombers at a cheap price which helped make the production viable, Associated British decided to proceed with the film and agreed with Brickhill on the film rights in December 1952 for what is believed to have been ¬£5,000.Dando-Collins. p. 241. After considering C.S. Forester, Terence Rattigan, as well as Emlyn Williams and Leslie Arliss, R. C. Sherriff was selected as the screenwriter with planned August delivery of the screenplay.Dando-Collins. p. 243. Sherriff agreed with Brickhill's opinion that the film needed to concentrate on Operation Chastise and exclude the later operations covered in the book. In preparation for writing the script, Sherriff met with Barnes Wallis at his home, later returning accompanied by Brickhill, Walter Mycroft and production supervisor W.A. \\"Bill\\" Whittaker on 22 March 1952 to witness Wallis demonstrating his original home experiment. To Wallis's embarrassment he couldn't get it to work, no matter how many times he tried.Dando-Collins. p. 245. Just prior to the film's scheduled release, Guy Gibson's widow Eve took legal action to prevent it, and Brickhill and Clark were mired in months of wrangling with her until references to her husband's book Enemy Coast Ahead were included. Production The flight sequences of the film were shot using real Avro Lancaster bombers supplied by the RAF. The aircraft, four of the final production B.VIIs, had to be taken out of storage and specially modified by removing the mid-upper gun turrets to mimic 617 Squadron's special aircraft, and cost ¬£130 per hour to run, which amounted to a tenth of the film's costs. A number of Avro Lincoln bombers were also used as \\"set dressing\\".Garbettt and Goulding 1971, pp. 142‚Äì143. (An American cut was made more dramatic by depicting an aircraft flying into a hill and exploding. This version used stock footage from Warner Brothers of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, not a Lancaster.) The Upper Derwent Valley in Derbyshire (the test area for the real raids) doubled as the Ruhr valley for the film. The scene where the Dutch coast is crossed was filmed between Boston, Lincolnshire and King's Lynn, Norfolk, and other coastal scenes near Skegness. Additional aerial footage was shot above Windermere, in the Lake District. An Avro Lancaster B.VII modified for the film with cut-out bomb bay and mock bouncing bomb demonstrating to a crowd at Coventry Airport in 1954 While RAF Scampton, where the real raid launched, was used for some scenes, the principal airfield used for ground location shooting was RAF Hemswell, a few miles north and still an operational RAF station at the time of filming. Guy Gibson had been based at Hemswell in his final posting and the airfield had been an operational Avro Lancaster base during the war. At the time filming took place it was then home to No. 109 Squadron and No. 139 Squadron RAF, which were both operating English Electric Canberras on electronic countermeasures and nuclear air sampling missions over hydrogen bomb test sites in the Pacific and Australia. However, part of the RAF's fleet of ageing Avro Lincolns had been mothballed at Hemswell prior to being broken up and several of these static aircraft appeared in background shots during filming, doubling for additional No 617 Squadron Lancasters. The station headquarters building still stands on what is now an industrial estate and is named Gibson House. The four wartime hangars also still stand, little changed in external appearance since the war.http://www.bcar.org.uk/hemswell-history Serving RAF pilots from both squadrons based at Hemswell took turns flying the Lancasters during filming and found the close formation and low level flying around Derwentwater and Windermere exhilarating and a welcome change from their normal high level solo Canberra sorties. Three of the four Lancaster bombers used in the film had also appeared in the Dirk Bogarde film Appointment in London two years earlier.\\" 'Appointment in London' (film)\\". imdb.com, 2009. Retrieved: 4 December 2009. The theatre scene showing the spotlights was filmed at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith. The dance troupe was The Television Toppers, on loan for one day filming, under contract from the BBC. The singer was June Powell, she sings the 1942 song \\"Sing Everybody Sing\\" by John P Long. The film featured several actors who would go on to be stars of cinema and TV. Robert Shaw was featured as Gibson's engineer Flt Sgt Pulford while George Baker played Flt Lt Maltby. Patrick McGoohan had a bit part as a security guard, standing guard outside the briefing room. He delivered the line‚Äî\\"Sorry, old boy, it's secret‚Äîyou can't go in. Now, c'mon, hop it!\\", which was cut from some prints of the film. Richard Thorp played Sqn Ldr Maudslay. =Soundtrack= The Dam Busters March, by Eric Coates, is for many synonymous with the film, as well as with the exploit itself, and remains a favourite military band item at flypasts and in the concert hall. Other than the introduction and trio section theme, the majority of the march as performed is not featured in the film soundtrack. Coates himself avoided writing music for the cinema, having been advised against it by Edward Elgar, and he only agreed to provide an overture for the film after he was persuaded by the film's producers it was of \\"national importance\\" and pressure was put on him via his publisher, Chappell. A march he had recently completed was found to fit well with the heroic subject and was thus submitted. The majority of the soundtrack including the theme played during the raid sequence in the film was composed by Leighton Lucas. Philip Lane, who reconstructed parts of Leighton Lucas's orchestral score (which had been lost) notes that Lucas created his own main theme \\"which seems to play hide and seek with Coates‚Äôs throughout the film, both vying for supremacy.\\" = Censorship = During World War II there was a dog called Nigger, a black Labrador belonging to Royal Air Force Wing Commander Guy Gibson, and the mascot of No. 617 Squadron. Gibson owned the dog when he was previously a member of 106 Squadron. Nigger often accompanied Gibson on training flights and was a great favourite of the members of both 106 and 617 Squadrons. He was noted for his liking of beer, which he drank from his own bowl in the Officers' Mess. Nigger died on 16 May 1943, the day of the \\"Dam Busters\\" raid, when he was hit by a car. He was buried at midnight as Gibson was leading the raid. The dog's name was used as a single codeword whose transmission conveyed that the M√∂hne Dam had been breached. In the film, the dog was portrayed in several scenes; his name and the codeword were mentioned several times. Some of the these scenes were sampled in the film Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall (1982). In 1999, British television network ITV broadcast a censored version of the film, removing all utterances of \\"Nigger\\". ITV blamed regional broadcaster London Weekend Television, which in turn alleged that a junior staff member had been responsible for the unauthorised cuts. When ITV again showed a censored version in June 2001, it was condemned by the Index on Censorship as \\"unnecessary and ridiculous\\" and because the edits introduced continuity errors.Milmo, Dan. \\"ITV attacked over Dam Busters censorship.\\" The Guardian, 11 June 2001. Retrieved: 4 December 2009. The British Channel 4 screened the censored American version in July 2007, in which the dialogue was dubbed so as to call the dog \\"Trigger\\", this screening took place just after the planned remake was announced. In September 2007, as part of the BBC Summer of British Film series, The Dam Busters was shown at selected cinemas across the UK in its uncut format. The original, uncensored, version was also shown on 1 and 5 January 2013, by Channel 5. It was the version, distributed by StudioCanal, containing shots of the bomber flying into a hill. In 2020, Film 4 has broadcast an edited version, possibly re- dubbed in a few places, where the dog's name is removed, addressed as \\"old boy\\" or referred to as \\"my dog\\". Historical accuracy A bomb aimer prepares to drop his bouncing bomb using an improvised device to determine the correct distance from the dam. The film is largely historically accurate, with only a small number of changes made for reasons of dramatic licence. Some errors derive from Paul Brickhill's book, which was written when much detail about the raid was not yet in the public domain. * Barnes Wallis said that he never encountered any opposition from bureaucracy. In the film, when a reluctant official asks what he can possibly say to the RAF to persuade them to lend a Vickers Wellington bomber for flight testing the bomb, Wallis suggests: \\"Well, if you told them that I designed it, do you think that might help?\\" Barnes Wallis was heavily involved with the design of the Wellington, as it used his geodesic construction method, though he was not actually its chief designer. * Instead of all of Gibson's tour-expired crew at 106 Squadron volunteering to follow him to his new command, only his wireless operator, Hutchinson, went with him to 617 Squadron. * Rather than the purpose as well as the method of the raid being Wallis's sole idea, the dams had already been identified as an important target by the Air Ministry before the war. * Gibson did not devise the spotlights altimeter after visiting a theatre; it was suggested by Benjamin Lockspeiser of the Ministry of Aircraft Production after Gibson requested they solve the problem. It was a proven method used by RAF Coastal Command aircraft for some time.\\"National Archives reveals inglorious truth behind classic World War Two movies.\\" culture24.org.uk, 2 September 2009. Retrieved: 23 December 2009. * The wooden \\"coat hanger\\" bomb sight intended to enable crews to release the weapon at the right distance from the target was not wholly successful; some crews used it, but others came up with their own solutions, such as pieces of string in the bomb-aimer's position and/or markings on the blister. * No bomber flew into a hillside near a target on the actual raid. This scene, which is not in the original version, was included in the copy released on the North American market (see above). Three bombers are brought down by enemy fire and two crashed due to hitting power lines in the valleys. * Some of the sequences showing the testing of Upkeep‚Äîthe code name for the weapon‚Äîin the film are of Mosquito fighter-bombers dropping the naval version of the bouncing bomb, code-named Highball, intended to be used against ships. This version of the weapon was never used operationally. * At the time the film was made, certain aspects of Upkeep were still held classified, so the actual test footage was censored to hide any details of the test bombs (a black dot was superimposed over the bomb on each frame), and the dummy bombs carried by the Lancasters were almost spherical but with flat sides rather than the true cylindrical shape. * The dummy bomb did not show the mechanism which created the back spin. * Ammunition shown being loaded into a Lancaster is .50 calibre for M2 Browning heavy machine guns, not that for the .303 calibre machine guns found on the Lancaster in 1943. * The scenes of the attack on the Eder Dam show a castle resembling Schloss Waldeck on the wrong side of the lake and dam. The position and angle of the lake in relation to the castle suggest that in reality the bombing-run would have needed a downhill approach to the west of the castle. * Wallis states that his idea came from Nelson's bouncing cannonballs into the sides of enemy ships. (He also states that Nelson sank one ship during the Battle of the Nile with a yorker, a cricket term for a ball that bounces under the bat, making it difficult to play.) There is no evidence for this claim. In a 1942 paper, Wallis mentioned the bouncing of cannonballs in the 16th and 17th centuries, but Nelson was not mentioned.Murray, Iain. Bouncing-Bomb Man: The Science of Sir Barnes Wallis. Sparkford, UK: Haynes, 2009. . * In the film Wallis (Redgrave) tells Gibson and Young that a mechanical problem with the release gear has been solved as the engineers had the correct oil in store. This is false; there was a technical problem which was solved by Sgt Charles Sackville-Bryant, who was awarded the BEM for this. Release The Dambusters received a Royal world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square on 16 May 1955, the twelfth anniversary of the raid.

Such wild rabbit populations are a serious mammalian pest and invasive species in Australia causing millions of dollars of damage to crops. Their spread may have been enhanced through the emergence of strong crossbreeds. Various methods in the 20th century have been attempted to control the Australian rabbit population. Conventional methods include shooting rabbits and destroying their warrens, but these had only limited success. In 1907, a rabbit-proof fence was built in Western Australia in an unsuccessful attempt to contain the rabbits. The myxoma virus, which causes myxomatosis, was introduced into the rabbit population in the 1950s and had the effect of severely reducing the rabbit population. However, the survivors have since adapted and partially recovered their previous numbers. History Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, rabbit shooting at Barwon Park, Victoria in the 1860s Rabbits were first introduced to Australia by the First Fleet in 1788. They were bred as food animals, probably in cages. In the first decades, they do not appear to have been numerous, judging from their absence from archaeological collections of early colonial food remains. However, by 1827 in Tasmania, a newspaper article noted \\"...the common rabbit is becoming so numerous throughout the colony, that they are running about on some large estates by thousands. We understand, that there are no rabbits whatever in the elder colony\\" i.e., New South Wales (NSW).Colonial Times and Tasmanian Advertiser 22 May 1827 This clearly shows a localised rabbit population explosion was underway in Tasmania in the early 19th century. At the same time in NSW, Cunningham noted, \\"... rabbits are bred around houses, but we have yet no wild ones in enclosures...\\" He also noted the scrubby, sandy rubble between Sydney and Botany Bay would be ideal for farming rabbits.Cunningham P. [1827] Two years in New South Wales, vol. 1, p. 304 Enclosures appear to mean more extensive rabbit-farming warrens, rather than cages. The first of these, in Sydney at least, was one built by Alexander Macleay at Elizabeth Bay House, \\"a preserve or rabbit-warren, surrounded by a substantial stone wall, and well stocked with that choice game.\\"Sydney Gazette 28 May 1831 In the 1840s, rabbit-keeping became even more common, with examples of the theft of rabbits from ordinary peoples' houses appearing in court records and rabbits entering the diets of ordinary people. In 1857‚Äì1858, Alexander Buchanan, overseer for F. H. Dutton's Anlaby Estate in the Mid-North of South Australia, released a number of rabbits for hunting sport. Their population remained fairly stable until around 1866, presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an Act of Parliament, but by 1867 was out of control. The population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators, but the emergence of a hardier breed by natural selection has subsequently been attributed to their spread. A load of rabbit skins, Northern Tablelands, New South Wales The current infestation appears to have originated with the release of 24 wild rabbits by Thomas Austin for hunting purposes in October 1859, on his property, Barwon Park, near Winchelsea, Victoria. While living in England, Austin had been an avid hunter, regularly dedicating his weekends to rabbit shooting. Upon arriving in Australia, which had no native rabbit population, Austin asked his nephew William Austin in England to send him 12 grey rabbits, five hares, 72 partridges, and some sparrows so he could continue his hobby in Australia by creating a local population of the species. At the time, he had stated, \\"The introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home, in addition to a spot of hunting\\". William could not source enough grey rabbits to meet his uncle's order, so he topped it up by buying domestic rabbits. One theory as to why the Barwon Park rabbits adapted so well to Australia is that the hybrid rabbits that resulted from the interbreeding of the two distinct types were much more suited to Australian conditions. Many other farms released their rabbits into the wild after Austin. The rabbits were extremely prolific creatures and spread rapidly across the southern parts of the country. Australia had ideal conditions for a rabbit population explosion. With mild winters, rabbits were able to breed the entire year. With widespread farming, areas that might otherwise have been scrub or woodlands were, instead, turned into vast areas with low vegetation, creating ideal habitats for rabbits. In a classic example of unintended consequences, rabbits had become so prevalent within 10 years of their introduction in 1859 that two million could be shot or trapped annually without having any noticeable effect on the population. It was the fastest spread ever recorded of any mammal anywhere in the world. Today, rabbits are entrenched in the southern and central areas of the country, with scattered populations in the northern deserts. Although the rabbit is a notorious pest, it proved useful to many people during the depressions of the 1890s and 1930s and during wartime. Trapping rabbits helped farmers, stockmen, and stationhands by providing food and extra income, and in some cases helped pay off farming debts. Rabbits were fed to working dogs and boiled to be fed to poultry. Later, frozen rabbit carcasses were traded locally and exported. Pelts, too, were used in the fur trade and are still used in the felt-hat industry. Effects on Australia's ecology The erosion of a gully in South Australia caused by rabbits overgrazing Since their introduction from Europe in the 19th century, the effect of rabbits on the ecology of Australia has been devastating. They are suspected of being the most significant known factor in species loss in Australia. Rabbits are believed to have had an immense impact on the abundance of natural resource availability, primarily concerning overgrazing. The rabbits would first deplete the natural pasture vegetation, and would then resort to consuming woody vegetation, which included small shrubs, and the leaves and bark of trees. The extent of plant species' loss is unknown at this time, though rabbits are known to often kill young trees in orchards, forests, and on properties by ringbarking them.Australian Encyclopaedia, Vol, VII, Grolier Society, Sydney Rabbits are also responsible for serious erosion problems, as they eat native plants, leaving the topsoil exposed and vulnerable to sheet, gully, and wind erosion. The removal of this topsoil is devastating to the land, as it takes many hundreds of years to regenerate. Control measures By 1887, losses from rabbit damage compelled the New South Wales government to offer a ¬£25,000 reward for \\"any method of success not previously known in the Colony for the effectual extermination of rabbits\\". The commission received 1456 suggestions, including several schemes involving biological controls (see below), but none was found to be both safe and effective. A Royal Commission was held to investigate the situation in 1901. Once the problem was understood, various control methods were tried to limit or reduce the population of rabbits in Australia. These methods had limited success until the introduction of biological control methods in the latter half of the 20th century. =Common control measures= baits to kill rabbits, Woolbrook, NSW Shooting rabbits is one of the most common control methods and can successfully be used to keep already low populations in check whilst providing food for people or pets, though it is ineffective for large-scale eradication. Destroying warrens through ripping (a procedure wherein rabbits are dismembered or buried alive as a bulldozer dragging sharp tines is driven over their warrens/burrows), ploughing, blasting, and fumigating is widely used, especially on large farms (known as \\"stations\\"). The sandy soil in many parts of Australia makes ripping and ploughing a viable method of control, and both tractors and bulldozers are used for this operation. Poisoning is probably the most widely used of the conventional techniques, as it requires the least effort, and capable of destroying a local population, though reinfestation given the mobility of the animal is almost inevitable. Laying baits of pollard laced with a phosphorus- based poison, such as \\"S.A.P.\\" manufactured by Sayers, Allport & Potter, was an early method. The advantage of phosphorus is that in dry weather, assuming it has not been laid in clumps (obviated by use of a poison cart), it soon degrades to innocuous phosphoric acid and presents no further danger to livestock or pets. It does, however, present a real fire risk, and concentrated fumes can be toxic to operators. More modern poisons for rabbit control are sodium fluoroacetate (\\"1080\\") and pindone. Another technique is hunting using ferrets, wherein ferrets are deployed to chase the rabbits out to be shot or into nets set over the burrows. Since the number of rabbits ferrets can kill is limited, this is more a hunting activity than a serious control method. Although ferrets and other mustelid species are used as control measures, Australia has significantly fewer wild mustelids to prey on the invasive rabbits while in their warrens or burrows compared to Europe and the United States. Historically, trapping was also frequently used; steel- jawed leg-holding traps were banned in most states in the 1980s on animal- cruelty grounds, though trapping continues at a lower level using rubber-jawed traps. All of these techniques are limited to working only in settled areas and are quite labour-intensive. =Fences= Ring-fencing can be highly effective way of providing a rabbit-free area. In the 1880s, James Moseley ringed Coondambo Station with wire netting and fenced off the watercourses; at the first heatwave, the rabbits perished of thirst. Shortly after 1900, he fenced off the deserted Yardea, Paney, Pondana, Yarloo, and Thurlga stations in the Gawler Ranges with of wire netting, turning them within a few years from degraded land overrun with rabbits into a profitable sheep run. Well- known modern examples, which also exclude foxes, dogs and cats are Warrawong and Yookamurra wildlife sanctuaries, pioneered by John Wamsley. Two well-known examples of much more extensive fences are: Queensland In July 1884 Ernest James Stevens, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, proposed that the Queensland Government erect a fence to prevent the infestation of rabbits in New South Wales from spreading into Queensland (his Logan electorate being very close to the New South Wales border).Gate in the Rabbit Fence at Stanthorpe, Queensland, 1934 In 1893, a rabbit-proof fence was commenced in Queensland. It was progressively extended through the years. In 1997, a final segment was built connecting it to the Dingo Fence. It extends from Mount Gipps (near Rathdowney) to Goombi between Chinchilla and Miles. Western Australia The No. 1 rabbit-fence in Western Australia (1926) In 1907, the rabbit-proof fence was built in Western Australia between Cape Keraudren and Esperance to try to control the spread of the rabbit population from the east into Western Australian pastoral areas. Given that European rabbits can both jump very high and burrow underground, a perfectly intact fence stretching for hundreds of kilometres, and whose gates farmers or graziers did not leave open for livestock or machinery, was still unlikely to succeed. As such, the Number 1 Rabbit-Proof Fence, which was erected in 1901, failed to keep the rabbit population away from the protected area. Even after this large scale fence had failed, smaller scale fencing projects continued to make a successful appearance. =Biological measures= Myxomatosis control trial, 1952 Releasing rabbit-borne diseases has proven somewhat successful in controlling the population of rabbits in Australia, but such success as has been achieved did not occur as quickly as was hoped. An offer by the New South Wales government of a ¬£25,000 reward for a biological control of rabbits attracted the attention of Louis Pasteur, who proposed using the chicken cholera bacillus (now known as Pasteurella multocida). Although that measure did not prove viable, the association with Pasteur accelerated the introduction of microbiology into Australia. On 16 April 1888, the New South Wales government appointed a royal commission \\"to make a full and diligent inquiry as to whether or not the introduction of contagious diseases amongst rabbits by inoculation or otherwise, or the propagation of diseases natural to rabbits ... will be accompanied or followed by danger to human health or life, or to animal life other than rabbits, or to interfere injuriously with the profitable carrying on of agricultural or pastoral pursuits ...\\" Under the aegis of the commission, tests were conducted at Rodd Island, and although rabbits who were given food adulterated with chicken cholera bacillus were killed, no evidence was found of the contagion spreading to healthy rabbits. In 1885, Professor Watson of Adelaide University suggested releasing rabbits inoculated with rabbit scab into an enclosed trial area. Limited trials suggested that the measure would be ineffective in the drier parts of the continent. In September 1887, Dr Herbert Butcher (1854-1893) of Wilcannia found a number of dead, emaciated rabbits at Tintinallogy Station. Dr H. Ellis of Sydney and he concluded that the animals had died of a novel disease, which they dubbed Tintinallogy virus. They felt it could be an effective control measure, but whatever the rabbits died from was never proved to be infectious or contagious. It may have been simple starvation caused by natural elements. In 1906 and 1907, Jean Danysz, of the Pasteur Institute of Paris, conducted trials on Broughton Island, New South Wales, of a strain of Pasteurella bacteria he had developed, which proved to be specific to rabbits, but it proved to be a less-than-satisfactory control measure. Dr Danysz felt that Broughton Island was a poor choice of test site, and that extensive experiments should be conducted on the mainland. Frank Tidswell, who was his chief Australian collaborator, continued Danysz's trials after he left in 1907, and also began trials of the Yalgogrin, Gundagai, and Picton microbes (named for the stations where infected rabbits were found), but financial support was lacking from the Federal government, or the collaboration of affected states, that would be necessary to prove that the measure safe and effective. The fact that these pathogens did not wipe out whole populations might have raised doubts as to their efficacy. In 1950, following research conducted by Frank Fenner, myxoma virus was deliberately released into the rabbit population, causing it to drop from an estimated 600 millionThe virus that stunned Australia's rabbits to around 100 million. Growing genetic resistance in the remaining rabbits had allowed the population to recover to 200‚Äì300 million by 1991. To combat that trend, over three years from June 1991, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) comprehensively tested the potential ofa Calicivirus, which causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), for biological control of wild rabbits. The virus escaped from a quarantine compound on Wardang Island, South Australia, where the field tests were being carried out, and by late October 1995, it was recorded in rabbits at Yunta and Gum Creek, in north-eastern South Australia. By the winter of 1996, the virus was established in Victoria, New South Wales, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The virus was discovered in these area by analyzing livers of dead rabbits. The success of the virus was found to be higher in dry areas, because of a benign calicivirus found in the colder, wetter areas of Australia, which was immunising rabbits against the more virulent form. A legal vaccine exists in Australia for RHD, but no cure is known for either myxomatosis or RHD, and many affected pets have to be euthanized. In Europe, where rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they are protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus with a genetically modified virusHorizontal Transmissible Protection against Myxomatosis and Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease by Using a Recombinant Myxoma Virus developed in Spain. A team headed by virologist Francisco Parra, working with the University of Oviedo, in Asturias, northern Spain, identified a new variant of the virus in 2012. The pathogen, a new strain of K5 (RHDV1), is both extremely lethal and highly contagious. In 2017, it was released by Australian authorities at around 600 points on the continent. Owners of domestic rabbits were advised to vaccinate their animals. In southern Europe, the scarcity of rabbits threatens the conservation of endangered predator species higher up the food chain, that depend on small game such as rabbits. These include the Iberian lynx and the Iberian imperial eagle. For this reason, biological warfare against rabbits in Australia is a serious concern for conservation activities in other parts of the world.

This is in contrast to the solo concerto which features a single solo instrument with the melody line, accompanied by the orchestra.  History  The form developed in the late seventeenth century, although the name was not used at first. Alessandro Stradella seems to have written the first music in which two groups of different sizes are combined in the characteristic way. The name was first used by Giovanni Lorenzo Gregori in a set of ten compositions published in Lucca in 1698.Treccani Dizionario Biografico The first major composer to use the term concerto grosso was Arcangelo Corelli. After Corelli's death, a collection of twelve of his concerti grossi was published. Not long after, composers such as Francesco Geminiani, Pietro Locatelli, and Giuseppe Torelli wrote concertos in the style of Corelli. He also had a strong influence on Antonio Vivaldi. Two distinct forms of the concerto grosso exist: # the concerto da chiesa (church concert) # the concerto da camera (chamber concert) The concerto da chiesa alternated slow and fast movements; the concerto da camera had the character of a suite, being introduced by a prelude and incorporating popular dance forms. (See also Sonata for a discussion about sonatas da camera and da chiesa.) These distinctions blurred over time. Corelli composed 48 trio sonatas, 12 violin and continuo sonatas,D.D. Boyden: \\"Corelli's Solo Violin Sonatas Grac'd by Dubourg\\", Festskrift Jens Peter Larsen, ed. N. Schi√∏rring, H. Glahn and C.E. Hatting (Copenhagen, 1972) and 12 concerti grossi. Six sets of twelve compositions, published between 1888 and 1891 by Chrysander, are authentically ascribed to Corelli, together with a few other works. * Opus 1: 12 sonate da chiesa (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1681) * Opus 2: 12 sonate da camera (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1685) * Opus 3: 12 sonate da chiesa (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1689) * Opus 4: 12 sonate da camera (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1694) * Opus 5: 12 Suonati a violino e violone o cimbalo (6 sonate da chiesa and 6 sonate da camera for violin and continuo) (Rome 1700) The last sonata is a set of variations on La Folia. * Opus 6: 12 concerti grossi (8 concerti da chiesa and 4 concerti da camera for concertino of 2 violins and cello, string ripieno, and continuo) (Amsterdam 1714) Corelli's concertino group consisted of two violins and a cello, with a string section as ripieno group. Both were accompanied by a basso continuo with some combination of harpsichord, organ, lute or theorbo. Handel wrote several collections of concerti grossi, and several of the Brandenburg Concertos by Bach also loosely follow the concerto grosso form. The concerto grosso form was superseded by the solo concerto and the sinfonia concertante in the late eighteenth century, and new examples of the form did not appear for more than a century. In the twentieth century, the concerto grosso has been used by composers including Igor Stravinsky, Ernest Bloch, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Bohuslav Martin≈Ø, Malcolm Williamson, Henry Cowell, Alfred Schnittke, William Bolcom, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Andrei Eshpai, Eino Tamberg, Krzysztof Penderecki, Jean Fran√ßaix, Airat Ichmouratov and Philip Glass. While Edward Elgar may not be considered a modern composer, his romantic Introduction and Allegro strongly resembled the instrumentation setup of a concerto grosso. Concertino A concertino, literally \\"little ensemble\\", is the group of soloists in a concerto grosso. This is opposed to the ripieno and tutti which is the larger group contrasting with the concertino. Though the concertino is the smaller of the two groups, its material is generally more virtuosic than that of the ripieno. Further, the concertino does not share thematic material with the ripieno, but presents unique ideas. This contrast of small group to large group and one thematic group against another is very characteristic of Baroque ideology‚Äîsimilar to terraced dynamics where the idea is significant contrast.

With the teeth aligned to electromagnet 1, they will be slightly offset from right electromagnet (2). Frame 2: The top electromagnet (1) is turned off, and the right electromagnet (2) is energized, pulling the teeth into alignment with it. This results in a rotation of 3.6¬∞ in this example. Frame 3: The bottom electromagnet (3) is energized; another 3.6¬∞ rotation occurs. Frame 4: The left electromagnet (4) is energized, rotating again by 3.6¬∞. When the top electromagnet (1) is again enabled, the rotor will have rotated by one tooth position; since there are 25 teeth, it will take 100 steps to make a full rotation in this example. A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application in respect to torque and speed. Switched reluctance motors are very large stepping motors with a reduced pole count, and generally are closed-loop commutated. Fundamentals of operation A stepper motor A bipolar hybrid stepper motor Brushed DC motors rotate continuously when DC voltage is applied to their terminals. The stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses (typically square waves) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft‚Äôs rotational position. Each pulse rotates the shaft through a fixed angle. Stepper motors effectively have multiple \\"toothed\\" electromagnets arranged as a stator around a central rotor, a gear-shaped piece of iron. The electromagnets are energized by an external driver circuit or a micro controller. To make the motor shaft turn, first, one electromagnet is given power, which magnetically attracts the gear's teeth. When the gear's teeth are aligned to the first electromagnet, they are slightly offset from the next electromagnet. This means that when the next electromagnet is turned on and the first is turned off, the gear rotates slightly to align with the next one. From there the process is repeated. Each of those rotations is called a \\"step\\", with an integer number of steps making a full rotation. In that way, the motor can be turned by a precise angle. The circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups, each group called a phase, and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group. The number of groups is chosen by the designer of the stepper motor. The electromagnets of each group are interleaved with the electromagnets of other groups to form a uniform pattern of arrangement. For example, if the stepper motor has two groups identified as A or B, and ten electromagnets in total, then the grouping pattern would be ABABABABAB. Electromagnets within the same group are all energized together. Because of this, stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires (or leads) to control the motor. Types There are three main types of stepper motors: # Permanent magnet stepper # Variable reluctance stepper # Hybrid synchronous stepper Permanent magnet motors use a permanent magnet (PM) in the rotor and operate on the attraction or repulsion between the rotor PM and the stator electromagnets. Pulses move the rotor in discrete steps, CW or CCW. If left powered at a final step a strong detent remains at that shaft location. This detent has a predictable spring rate and specified torque limit; slippage occurs if the limit is exceeded. If current is removed a lesser detent still remains, therefore holding shaft position against spring or other torque influences. Stepping can then be resumed while reliably being synchronized with control electronics. Variable reluctance (VR) motors have a plain iron rotor and operate based on the principle that minimum reluctance occurs with minimum gap, hence the rotor points are attracted toward the stator magnet poles. Whereas hybrid synchronous are a combination of the permanent magnet and variable reluctance types, to maximize power in a small size. VR motors do not have power off detents.  Two-phase stepper motors  There are two basic winding arrangements for the electromagnetic coils in a two phase stepper motor: bipolar and unipolar. = Unipolar motors = Unipolar stepper motor coils A unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase. Each section of windings is switched on for each direction of magnetic field. Since in this arrangement a magnetic pole can be reversed without switching the direction of current, the commutation circuit can be made very simple (e.g., a single transistor) for each winding. Typically, given a phase, the center tap of each winding is made common: giving three leads per phase and six leads for a typical two phase motor. Often, these two phase commons are internally joined, so the motor has only five leads. A microcontroller or stepper motor controller can be used to activate the drive transistors in the right order, and this ease of operation makes unipolar motors popular with hobbyists; they are probably the cheapest way to get precise angular movements. For the experimenter, the windings can be identified by touching the terminal wires together in PM motors. If the terminals of a coil are connected, the shaft becomes harder to turn. One way to distinguish the center tap (common wire) from a coil-end wire is by measuring the resistance. Resistance between common wire and coil-end wire is always half of the resistance between coil-end wires. This is because there is twice the length of coil between the ends and only half from center (common wire) to the end. A quick way to determine if the stepper motor is working is to short circuit every two pairs and try turning the shaft. Whenever a higher than normal resistance is felt, it indicates that the circuit to the particular winding is closed and that the phase is working. flatbed scanner. ULN2003 driver, is one of the most popular stepper motors among hobbyists. =Bipolar motors= DVD drives for moving the laser assembly. Bipolar motors have a single winding per phase. The current in a winding needs to be reversed in order to reverse a magnetic pole, so the driving circuit must be more complicated, typically with an H-bridge arrangement (however there are several off-the-shelf driver chips available to make this a simple affair). There are two leads per phase, none are common. A typical driving pattern for a two coil bipolar stepper motor would be: A+ B+ A‚àí B‚àí. I.e. drive coil A with positive current, then remove current from coil A; then drive coil B with positive current, then remove current from coil B; then drive coil A with negative current (flipping polarity by switching the wires e.g. with an H bridge), then remove current from coil A; then drive coil B with negative current (again flipping polarity same as coil A); the cycle is complete and begins anew. Static friction effects using an H-bridge have been observed with certain drive topologies.See \\"Friction and the Dead Zone\\" by Douglas W Jones https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~jones/step/physics.html#friction Dithering the stepper signal at a higher frequency than the motor can respond to will reduce this \\"static friction\\" effect. flatbed scanner. Because windings are better utilized, they are more powerful than a unipolar motor of the same weight. This is due to the physical space occupied by the windings. A unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space, but only half used at any point in time, hence is 50% efficient (or approximately 70% of the torque output available). Though a bipolar stepper motor is more complicated to drive, the abundance of driver chips means this is much less difficult to achieve. An 8-lead stepper is like a unipolar stepper, but the leads are not joined to common internally to the motor. This kind of motor can be wired in several configurations: * Unipolar. * Bipolar with series windings. This gives higher inductance but lower current per winding. * Bipolar with parallel windings. This requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced. * Bipolar with a single winding per phase. This method will run the motor on only half the available windings, which will reduce the available low speed torque but require less current  Higher-phase count stepper motors  Multi-phase stepper motors with many phases tend to have much lower levels of vibration. While they are more expensive, they do have a higher power density and with the appropriate drive electronics are often better suited to the application. Driver circuits Adafruit Motor Shield drive circuit for use with Arduino Stepper motor performance is strongly dependent on the driver circuit. Torque curves may be extended to greater speeds if the stator poles can be reversed more quickly, the limiting factor being a combination of the winding inductance. To overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly, one must increase the drive voltage. This leads further to the necessity of limiting the current that these high voltages may otherwise induce. An additional limitation, often comparable to the effects of inductance, is the back-EMF of the motor. As the motor's rotor turns, a sinusoidal voltage is generated proportional to the speed (step rate). This AC voltage is subtracted from the voltage waveform available to induce a change in the current. = L/R driver circuits = L/R driver circuits are also referred to as constant voltage drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions. However, it is winding current, not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft. The current I in each winding is related to the applied voltage V by the winding inductance L and the winding resistance R. The resistance R determines the maximum current according to Ohm's law I=V/R. The inductance L determines the maximum rate of change of the current in the winding according to the formula for an inductor dI/dt = V/L. The resulting current for a voltage pulse is a quickly increasing current as a function of inductance. This reaches the V/R value and holds for the remainder of the pulse. Thus when controlled by an constant voltage drive, the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed, the voltage U will be changing faster than the current I can keep up. In simple terms the rate of change of current is L / R (e.g. a 10 mH inductance with 2 ohms resistance will take 5 ms to reach approx 2/3 of maximum torque or around 24 ms to reach 99% of max torque). To obtain high torque at high speeds requires a large drive voltage with a low resistance and low inductance. With an L/R drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding. This will waste power in the resistors, and generate heat. It is therefore considered a low performing option, albeit simple and cheap. Modern voltage-mode drivers overcome some of these limitations by approximating a sinusoidal voltage waveform to the motor phases. The amplitude of the voltage waveform is set up to increase with step rate. If properly tuned, this compensates the effects of inductance and back- EMF, allowing decent performance relative to current-mode drivers, but at the expense of design effort (tuning procedures) that are simpler for current-mode drivers. =Chopper drive circuits= Chopper drive circuits are referred to as controlled current drives because they generate a controlled current in each winding rather than applying a constant voltage. Chopper drive circuits are most often used with two-winding bipolar motors, the two windings being driven independently to provide a specific motor torque CW or CCW. On each winding, a \\"supply\\" voltage is applied to the winding as a square wave voltage; example 8 kHz.. The winding inductance smooths the current which reaches a level according to the square wave duty cycle. Most often bipolar supply (+ and - ) voltages are supplied to the controller relative to the winding return. So 50% duty cycle results in zero current. 0% results in full V/R current in one direction. 100% results in full current in the opposite direction. This current level is monitored by the controller by measuring the voltage across a small sense resistor in series with the winding. This requires additional electronics to sense winding currents, and control the switching, but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than L/R drives. It also allows the controller to output predetermined current levels rather than fixed. Integrated electronics for this purpose are widely available. Phase current waveforms Different drive modes showing coil current on a 4-phase unipolar stepper motor. A stepper motor is a polyphase AC synchronous motor (see Theory below), and it is ideally driven by sinusoidal current. A full-step waveform is a gross approximation of a sinusoid, and is the reason why the motor exhibits so much vibration. Various drive techniques have been developed to better approximate a sinusoidal drive waveform: these are half stepping and microstepping. =Wave drive (one phase on) = In this drive method only a single phase is activated at a time. It has the same number of steps as the full-step drive, but the motor will have significantly less torque than rated. It is rarely used. The animated figure shown above is a wave drive motor. In the animation, rotor has 25 teeth and it takes 4 steps to rotate by one tooth position. So there will be 25√ó4 = 100 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/100 = 3.6 degrees. = Full-step drive (two phases on) = This is the usual method for full-step driving the motor. Two phases are always on so the motor will provide its maximum rated torque. As soon as one phase is turned off, another one is turned on. Wave drive and single phase full step are both one and the same, with same number of steps but difference in torque. =Half- stepping= When half-stepping, the drive alternates between two phases on and a single phase on. This increases the angular resolution. The motor also has less torque (approx 70%) at the full-step position (where only a single phase is on). This may be mitigated by increasing the current in the active winding to compensate. The advantage of half stepping is that the drive electronics need not change to support it. In animated figure shown above, if we change it to half-stepping, then it will take 8 steps to rotate by 1 teeth position. So there will be 25√ó8 = 200 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/200 = 1.8¬∞. Its angle per step is half of the full step. =Microstepping= What is commonly referred to as microstepping is often sine‚Äìcosine microstepping in which the winding current approximates a sinusoidal AC waveform. The common way to achieve Sine-cosine current is with chopper-drive circuits. Sine‚Äìcosine microstepping is the most common form, but other waveforms can be used.zaber.com, microstepping Regardless of the waveform used, as the microsteps become smaller, motor operation becomes more smooth, thereby greatly reducing resonance in any parts the motor may be connected to, as well as the motor itself. Resolution will be limited by the mechanical stiction, backlash, and other sources of error between the motor and the end device. Gear reducers may be used to increase resolution of positioning. Step size reduction is an important step motor feature and a fundamental reason for their use in positioning. Example: many modern hybrid step motors are rated such that the travel of every full step (example 1.8 degrees per full step or 200 full steps per revolution) will be within 3% or 5% of the travel of every other full step, as long as the motor is operated within its specified operating ranges. Several manufacturers show that their motors can easily maintain the 3% or 5% equality of step travel size as step size is reduced from full stepping down to 1/10 stepping. Then, as the microstepping divisor number grows, step size repeatability degrades. At large step size reductions it is possible to issue many microstep commands before any motion occurs at all and then the motion can be a \\"jump\\" to a new position. Some stepper controller ICs use increased current to minimise such missed steps, especially when the peak current pulses in one phase would otherwise be very brief. Theory A step motor can be viewed as a synchronous AC motor with the number of poles (on both rotor and stator) increased, taking care that they have no common denominator. Additionally, soft magnetic material with many teeth on the rotor and stator cheaply multiplies the number of poles (reluctance motor). Modern steppers are of hybrid design, having both permanent magnets and soft iron cores. To achieve full rated torque, the coils in a stepper motor must reach their full rated current during each step. Winding inductance and counter-EMF generated by a moving rotor tend to resist changes in drive current, so that as the motor speeds up, less and less time is spent at full current‚Äîthus reducing motor torque. As speeds further increase, the current will not reach the rated value, and eventually the motor will cease to produce torque. = Pull-in torque = This is the measure of the torque produced by a stepper motor when it is operated without an acceleration state. At low speeds the stepper motor can synchronize itself with an applied step frequency, and this pull-in torque must overcome friction and inertia. It is important to make sure that the load on the motor is frictional rather than inertial as the friction reduces any unwanted oscillations. The pull-in curve defines an area called the start/stop region. Into this region, the motor can be started/stopped instantaneously with a load applied and without loss of synchronism. = Pull-out torque = The stepper motor pull-out torque is measured by accelerating the motor to the desired speed and then increasing the torque loading until the motor stalls or misses steps. This measurement is taken across a wide range of speeds and the results are used to generate the stepper motor's dynamic performance curve. As noted below this curve is affected by drive voltage, drive current and current switching techniques. A designer may include a safety factor between the rated torque and the estimated full load torque required for the application. =Detent torque= Synchronous electric motors using permanent magnets have a resonant position holding torque (called detent torque or cogging, and sometimes included in the specifications) when not driven electrically. Soft iron reluctance cores do not exhibit this behavior. =Ringing and resonance= When the motor moves a single step it overshoots the final resting point and oscillates round this point as it comes to rest. This undesirable ringing is experienced as motor rotor vibration and is more pronounced in unloaded motors. An unloaded or under loaded motor may, and often will, stall if the vibration experienced is enough to cause loss of synchronisation. Stepper motors have a natural frequency of operation. When the excitation frequency matches this resonance the ringing is more pronounced, steps may be missed, and stalling is more likely. Motor resonance frequency can be calculated from the formula: : f=\\\\frac{100}{2\\\\pi} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2p M_h}{J_r} } ::;: Holding torque N¬∑m ::; : Number of pole pairs ::; : Rotor inertia kg¬∑m¬≤ The magnitude of the undesirable ringing is dependent on the back emf resulting from rotor velocity. The resultant current promotes damping, so the drive circuit characteristics are important. The rotor ringing can be described in terms of damping factor. Ratings and specifications Stepper motors' nameplates typically give only the winding current and occasionally the voltage and winding resistance. The rated voltage will produce the rated winding current at DC: but this is mostly a meaningless rating, as all modern drivers are current limiting and the drive voltages greatly exceed the motor rated voltage. Datasheets from the manufacturer often indicate Inductance. Back-EMF is equally relevant, but seldom listed (it is straightforward to measure with an oscilloscope). These figures can be helpful for more in-depth electronics design, when deviating from standard supply voltages, adapting third party driver electronics, or gaining insight when choosing between motor models with otherwise similar size, voltage, and torque specifications. A stepper's low- speed torque will vary directly with current. How quickly the torque falls off at faster speeds depends on the winding inductance and the drive circuitry it is attached to, especially the driving voltage. Steppers should be sized according to published torque curve, which is specified by the manufacturer at particular drive voltages or using their own drive circuitry. Dips in the torque curve suggest possible resonances, whose impact on the application should be understood by designers. Step motors adapted to harsh environments are often referred to as IP65 rated.More on what is an IP65 step motor: http://www.applied-motion.com/videos/intro-amps-ip65-rated-motors-motordrives The US National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) standardises various aspects of stepper motors. They are typically referred with NEMA DD, where DD is the diameter of the faceplate in inches multiplied by 10 (e.g., NEMA 17 has a diameter of 1.7 inches). There are further specifiers to describe stepper motors, and such details may be found in the ICS 16-2001 standard (section 4.3.1.1). There are also useful summaries and further information on the Reprap site. Applications Computer controlled stepper motors are a type of motion-control positioning system. They are typically digitally controlled as part of an open loop system for use in holding or positioning applications. In the field of lasers and optics they are frequently used in precision positioning equipment such as linear actuators, linear stages, rotation stages, goniometers, and mirror mounts. Other uses are in packaging machinery, and positioning of valve pilot stages for fluid control systems. Commercially, stepper motors are used in floppy disk drives, flatbed scanners, computer printers, plotters, slot machines, image scanners, compact disc drives, intelligent lighting, camera lenses, CNC machines and, more recently, in 3D printers. Stepper motor system A stepper motor system consists of three basic elements, often combined with some type of user interface (host computer, PLC or dumb terminal): ;Indexers: The indexer (or controller) is a microprocessor capable of generating step pulses and direction signals for the driver. In addition, the indexer is typically required to perform many other sophisticated command functions. ;Drivers: The driver (or amplifier) converts the indexer command signals into the power necessary to energize the motor windings. There are numerous types of drivers, with different voltage and current ratings and construction technology. Not all drivers are suitable to run all motors, so when designing a motion control system the driver selection process is critical. ;Stepper motors: The stepper motor is an electromagnetic device that converts digital pulses into mechanical shaft rotation. Advantages of step motors are low cost, high reliability, high torque at low speeds and a simple, rugged construction that operates in almost any environment. The main disadvantages in using a stepper motor is the resonance effect often exhibited at low speeds and decreasing torque with increasing speed. Advantages *Low cost for control achieved *High torque at startup and low speeds *Ruggedness *Simplicity of construction *Can operate in an open loop control system *Low maintenance *Less likely to stall or slip *Will work in any environment *Can be used in robotics in a wide scale. *High reliability *The rotation angle of the motor is proportional to the input pulse. *The motor has full torque at standstill (if the windings are energized) *Precise positioning and repeatability of movement since good stepper motors have an accuracy of 3‚Äì5% of a step and this error is non- cumulative from one step to the next. *Excellent response to starting/stopping/reversing. *Very reliable since there are no contact brushes in the motor. Therefore, the life of the motor is simply dependent on the life of the bearing. *The motors response to digital input pulses provides open- loop control, making the motor simpler and less costly to control. *It is possible to achieve very low-speed synchronous rotation with a load that is directly coupled to the shaft. *A wide range of rotational speeds can be realized as the speed is proportional to the frequency of the input pulses.

Early proponents of the theory were the Austrian Wunderteam of the 1930s, the Argentine side \\"La Maquina\\" of River Plate in the 1940s, the Golden Team of Hungary in the 1950s, English team Burnley in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and Brazilian side Santos in the 1960s. It was made popular by Dutch club Ajax in the early 1970s and the Netherlands national football team at the 1974 FIFA World Cup. In Total Football, a player who moves out of his position is replaced by another from his team, thus retaining the team's intended organisational structure. In this fluid system, no outfield player is fixed in a predetermined role; anyone can successively play as an attacker, a midfielder and a defender. The only player who must stay in a specified position is the goalkeeper. Total Football's tactical success depends largely on the adaptability of each footballer within the team, in particular the ability to quickly switch positions depending on the on-field situation. The theory requires players to be comfortable in multiple positions; hence, it requires very intelligent and technically diverse players. During the 1970s, Ajax played some of their finest football ever, achieving a perfect home record (46‚Äì0‚Äì0) for two full seasons (1971‚Äì72 and 1972‚Äì73), just one defeat in the whole of the 1971‚Äì72 season, and celebrating four titles in 1972 (the Netherlands national league, KNVB Cup, European Cup and Intercontinental Cup). History=Early developments= Jimmy Hogan The Golden Team (Mighty Magyars) in 1953 The first foundations for Total Football were laid by continental pioneer Jimmy Hogan, a Burnley native. Working with Austrian coach and his friend Hugo Meisl in the early 1930s, Meisl's Austrian national team (known as the \\"Wunderteam\\") became possibly the first side to play Total Football. Hogan's influence reached beyond the Austrian borders, as two decades later the Hungarian national team (also known as the \\"Golden Team\\") played a similar style of football under coach Guszt√°v Sebes. The then president of the Hungarian Football Association, Sandor Barcs, said: \\"Jimmy Hogan taught us everything we know about football\\". Another team who played a similar style as the Austrians, were Torino (\\"Grande Torino\\" as the team was called) in the 1940s. Between 1941 and 1947, Argentinian club River Plate formed a remarkable team, known as \\"La M√°quina\\" (The Machine), whose famous front formed by Carlos Mu√±oz, Jos√© Manuel Moreno, Adolfo Pedernera, √Ångel Labruna and F√©lix Loustau perfected the \\"false nine\\" style and the constant change of attack positions. \\"La M√°quina\\" won several Argentine and international titles. Also in the 1940s, English manager Jack Reynolds, implemented a Total Football style while at Dutch club Ajax. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Burnley F.C. were playing a renewed system in English football \\"where every player could play in every position\\" under manager Harry Potts. This Total Football system led Burnley to the 1959‚Äì60 league title and won many plaudits, including admiration from all-time English First Division top scorer Jimmy Greaves.Quelch (2015), p. 11 Another pioneer was Vic Buckingham, manager of West Bromwich Albion, Ajax and Barcelona in the 1950s and 1960s, as his philosophy was later further developed by Johan Cruyff, a player who was introduced into the Ajax first team by Buckingham. =Totaalvoetbal schools of Gloria Ajax and The Clockwork Orange (1960s‚Äì1970s)= Johan Cruyff playing with Ajax in 1971. Cruyff was instrumental in Ajax's dominance of European football in the early 1970s. Due to the way Cruyff played the game, he is still referred to as \\"the Total Footballer\\". In Cruyff's own words, \\"In my teams, the goalie (goalkeeper) is the first attacker and the striker the first defender.\\" Three of the most notable figures of the Totaalvoetbal school: Johan Neeskens, Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff Rinus Michels, who played under Reynolds, later became manager of Ajax in 1965. Michels reworked the theory, with his introduction of forward Johan Cruyff, perhaps the system's most famous exponent. Although Cruyff was fielded as centre forward, Michels encouraged Cruyff to roam freely around the pitch, using technical ability and intelligence to exploit the weaknesses in the opposition and create chances. Cruyff's teammates also worked to adapt themselves accordingly, regularly switching positions to ensure tactical roles in the team were consistently filled.'FIFA Classic Player: The Netherlands' Grand Master. FIFA.com. Retrieved 14 July 2014 Austrian coach Ernst Happel reworked the theory to introduce strength, encouraging his players to play tougher during his spells at ADO Den Haag and Feyenoord. Happel also managed the Netherlands national team to a runner-up finish in the 1978 World Cup. The major component was the use of space, with the need to consistently create space central to the concept of Total Football. Former Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff described it as \\"[the thing] we discussed the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where to run and where to stand, and when not to move\\". He further elaborated that position switching was only made possible due to apt spatial awareness. He also described Total Football being proactive, as well as highlighting the use of pressing, which would be used to win back the ball or put the opposition under considerable pressure. Michels and Cruyff saw unprecedented success with the system, winning eight Eredivisie titles, three European Cups, and one Intercontinental Cup. The stark rise of Total Football and its attacking prowess was also linked with the \\"death of Catenaccio\\", an Italian system reliant heavily on defense promoted by Internazionale during the 1960s. The Total Football system was prone to defeat, experienced notably in the final of the 1974 FIFA World Cup contested by the Dutch and West Germany. Michels and Cruyff saw their ability to introduce playmaking stifled in the second half of the match by the effective marking of Berti Vogts. This allowed Franz Beckenbauer, Uli Hoene√ü, and Wolfgang Overath to gain a stronghold in midfield, thus, enabling West Germany to win 2‚Äì1. Brazilian football manager and former player Tel√™ Santana mentioned in one interview, \\"My greatest satisfaction would be to manage a team such as 1974 Holland. It was a team where you could pick [Johan] Cruyff and place him on the right wing. If I had to put him in the left-wing, he would still play [the same]. I could choose Neeskens, who played both to the right and to the left of the midfield. Thus, everyone played in any position.\\" In an interview published in the 50th anniversary issue of World Soccer magazine, the captain of the Brazilian team that won the 1970 World Cup, Carlos Alberto, went on to say, \\"The only team I've seen that did things differently was Holland at the 1974 World Cup in Germany. Since then everything looks more or less the same to me.... Their 'carousel' style of play was amazing to watch and marvellous for the game.\\" =After the 1970s= FC Barcelona (particularly under manager Pep Guardiola) and the Spanish national team of the early 2010s developed a play style called Juego de Posici√≥n, based on the theory of Total Football, and the managerial philosophy of former Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff.

He died aboard when the ship sank in the North Atlantic Ocean. His body was never recovered. Early life Benjamin Guggenheim was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the fifth of seven sons of the wealthy mining magnate Meyer Guggenheim (1828‚Äì1905), and Barbara Myers (1834‚Äì1900), both originally from Lengnau, Aargau, Switzerland.Barbara Myers Guggenheim The first member of his family to enter an institute of higher learning, he entered Columbia College in 1882, matriculating with the class of 1887. However, he found most of his course boring and dropped out after his second year. He also attended the Peirce School of Business (now Peirce College), then one of the most prominent business schools in the country. Guggenheim was Jewish.http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/The-Titanic-and-Jews In 1894, he married Florette Seligman (1870‚Äì1937),Guggenheim-Seligman : New York Times (1894) ‚Äì October 25, 1894 daughter of James Seligman, a senior partner in the firm J. & W. Seligman & Co. and Rosa Seligman, n√©e Content. Her family originated in Baiersdorf, Franconia, Germany. Together, they had three daughters: Benita Rosalind Guggenheim (1895‚Äì1927), Marguerite \\"Peggy\\" Guggenheim (1898‚Äì1979) and Barbara Hazel Guggenheim (1903‚Äì1995). Guggenheim inherited a great deal of money from his mother. Due to business concerns, he grew distant from his wife and was frequently away from their New York City home. He maintained an apartment in Paris, France. Aboard the Titanic This The New York Times article relates a steward's account of Guggenheim's last hours. Guggenheim boarded the and was accompanied by his mistress, a French singer named L√©ontine Aubart (1887‚Äì1964); his valet, Victor Giglio (1888‚Äì1912); his chauffeur, Ren√© Pernot (1872‚Äì1912); and Madame Aubart's maid, Emma S√§gesser (1887‚Äì1964). His ticket was number 17593 and cost ¬£79 4s (other sources give the price as ¬£56 18s 7d). He and Giglio occupied stateroom cabin B84 while Aubart and S√§gesser occupied cabin B35. Pernot occupied an unknown cabin in second class. Guggenheim and Giglio slept through the Titanic encounter with the iceberg only to be awakened just after midnight ship's time by Aubart and S√§gesser, who had felt the collision. S√§gesser later quoted Giglio as saying, \\"Never mind, icebergs! What is an iceberg?\\" Guggenheim was persuaded to awaken and dress, and bedroom steward Henry Samuel Etches helped fit him with a lifebelt and a heavy sweater before sending Guggenheim, Giglio, and the two women up to the boat deck. As Aubart and S√§gesser reluctantly entered Lifeboat No. 9, Guggenheim spoke to the maid in German, saying, \\"We will soon see each other again! It's just a repair. Tomorrow the Titanic will go on again.\\" Realizing that the situation was much more serious than he had implied and that he was not going to be rescued, he returned to his cabin with Giglio and the two men changed into evening wear. Titanic survivor Rose Amelie Icard wrote in a letter, \\"The millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim after having helped the rescue of women and children, got dressed and put a rose at his buttonhole, to die.\\" He was heard to remark, \\"We've dressed up in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.\\" Etches, who survived the sinking, recorded Guggenheim's message: \\"If anything should happen to me, tell my wife in New York that I've done my best in doing my duty.\\" Etches reported that \\"shortly after the last few boats were lowered and I was ordered by the deck officer to man an oar, I waved good-bye to Mr. Guggenheim, and that was the last I saw of him and [Giglio].\\" Both men died in the sinking. Their bodies, if recovered, were never identified. Guggenheim's chauffeur Pernot was also lost in the disaster. Portrayals Guggenheim was among the most prominent American victims of the disaster. As such, he has been portrayed in numerous films, television series and a Broadway show based on the sinking: * Camillo Guercio (in an uncredited role) in Titanic (1953) * Harold Goldblatt in A Night to Remember (1958) * John Moffatt in SOS Titanic (1979) * Michael Ensign in Titanic (1997) See also * Guggenheim family ReferencesExternal links and references *Encyclopedia Titanica Biography of Benjamin Guggenheim *Benjamin Guggenheim on Titanic-Titanic.com *Encyclopedia Titanica Biography of Emma S√§gesser *Titanic: Triumph and Tragedy, by John P.

Until its dissolution in 1866, the institution was the highest authority in Sweden next to the King. It was a Diet made up of the Four Estates, which historically were the lines of division in Swedish society: * Nobility * Clergy * Burghers * Peasants Important assemblies House of Nobility, seat of the Swedish nobility. The meeting at Arboga in 1435 is usually considered to be the first Riksdag, but there is no indication that the fourth estate, the peasants, had been represented there. * The actual first meeting is likely the one that took place at Uppsala in 1436 after the death of rebel leader Engelbrekt. * At the Riksdag in 1517, regent Sten Sture the Younger and the Privy Council deposed archbishop Gustav Trolle. * At V√§ster√•s in 1527 Lutheranism was adopted as the new state religion instead of Roman Catholicism. * At Arboga in 1561, the term Riksdag was used for the first time. * At S√∂derk√∂ping in 1595, duke Charles was elected regent of Sweden instead of king Sigismund, who was a Catholic and the king of both Sweden and Poland. * In 1612 the Riksdag gave the nobility the privilege and right to hold all higher offices of government, after successful lobbying by Axel Oxenstierna. * The first open conflict between the different estates happened in 1650. * At the Riksdag in 1680 a large scale reduction (a return of lands to the Crown earlier granted to the nobility) was enacted, and Sweden became an absolute monarchy. * In 1719, the Riksdag elected Ulrika Eleonora as heir in place of her older sister's son, and Ulrika Eleonora accepted a new constitution restoring the powers of the Riksdag. * In 1771‚Äì1772, when Gustavus III after his Revolution of 1772 introduced a new Instrument of Government. * In 1789, the Riksdag accepted an addition to the instrument of government from 1772. This new law, the Union and Security Act, abolished most noble privileges and commoners, regardless of rank, could hold virtually any office Sweden. * In 1809, the Riksdag elected Charles XIII king after his nephew Gustav IV Adolf had been deposed, and after the new king had accepted a new constitution that ended Sweden's second Autocracy (1789‚Äì1809). * At the sessions in 1634, 1719, 1720, 1772 and 1809 new constitutions were adopted.  Replaced by the new Riksdag  The constitution of 1809 divided the powers of government between the monarch and the Riksdag of the Estates, and after 1866 between the monarch and the new Riksdag. In 1866 all the Estates voted in favor of dissolution and at the same time to constitute a new assembly, Sveriges Riksdag. The four former estates were abolished. The House of Nobility () remains as a quasi-official representation of the Swedish nobility. The modern Centre Party, which grew out of the Swedish farmers' movement, could be construed as a modern representation with a traditional bond to the Estate of the Peasants.  Riksdag in Finland  Following the Finnish War in 1809, Sweden ceded its eastmost provinces to the Russian Empire. Comprising much of present-day Finland, these became a Grand Duchy under the Emperor, but the political institutions were kept practically intact. The Finnish estates assembled in 1809 at Porvoo to confirm the change in their allegiance. This Diet of Finland followed the forms of the Swedish Riksdag, being the legislative body of the new autonomous region. However, during the reigns of Alexander I and Nicholas I it was not assembled and no new legislation was enacted. The diet was next assembled by tsar Alexander II in 1863, due to the need to modernize the laws. After this the Diet met regularly until 1905, when it passed an act forming a new unicameral parliament. That assembly has been Finland's legislative body since then. The Finnish House of Nobility (; ) carries on the tradition of the Estate of Nobility, but no new families have been ennobled since 1906.

The table provides water, peanuts, sunflower seeds and a seed mix. Bird feeding is the activity of feeding wild birds, often by means of a bird feeder. With a recorded history dating to the 6th century, the feeding of wild birds has been encouraged and celebrated in the United Kingdom and United States, with it being the United States' second most popular hobby having National Bird-Feeding Month congressionally decreed in 1994. Various types of food are provided by various methods; certain combinations of food and method of feeding are known to attract certain bird species. The feeding of wild birds has been shown to have possible negative as well as positive effects; while a study in Sheffield, England found that the abundance of garden birds increased with levels of bird feeding, multiple reports suggest that bird feeding may have various negative ecological effects and may be detrimental to the birds being fed, including increased risk of predatory action and malnutrition. It has been estimated that American adults spend approximately US$3.8 billion a year on food, feeders and related accessories. History The British naturalist James Fisher wrote that the first person recorded as feeding wild birds was the 6th- century monk Saint Serf of Fife who tamed a pigeon by feeding it. During the harsh winter of 1890‚Äì1891 in the United Kingdom national newspapers asked people to put out food for birds. In 1910 in the United Kingdom, Punch magazine declared that feeding birds was a \\"national pastime.\\"Moss, Stephen 2004 A bird in the bush.

Activity  Bird feeding is typically thought of as an activity of bird enthusiasts. People who feed wild birds often attempt to attract birds to suburban and domestic locations. This requires setting up a feeding station and supplying bird food. The food might include seeds, peanuts, bought food mixes, fat, kitchen scraps and suet. Additionally, a bird bath and grit (sand), that birds store in their crops to help grind food as an aid to digestion, can be provided. Feeding bread to waterfowl at parks, lakes and rivers is also a popular activity.  Types  Seabird feeding Certain foods tend to attract certain birds. Finches and siskin will be attracted by Niger, and jays love maize. Hummingbirds, sunbirds and other nectivorous birds love nectar. Mixed seed and black oil sunflower seed is favoured by many seed- eating species. In Australia, meat, especially raw beef mince (or ground beef), is commonly fed to wild, carnivorous birds such as Australian magpies and kookaburras. Birds such as white-eyes, barbets, and some thrushes will take fresh and cut fruit. Different feeders can be purchased specialized for different species. It is not only small birds that are attracted by bird feeding. In some urban areas of the UK, red kites are fed chicken and table scraps in gardens. Garden birds can be fed using peanuts, seed, coconut (but never desiccated coconut) or fat (but not oils that are liquid at room temperature) using a variety of feeders. After a station is established, it can take some weeks for birds to discover and start using it. This is particularly true if the feeding station is the first one in an area or (in cold-winter areas) if the station is being established in spring when natural sources of food are plentiful. Food, particularly unshelled foods, such as thistle seed and suet, left uneaten for too long may spoil. Birds also require a source of drinking water and a bird bath can attract as many birds as a feeding station. In North America, suet can be used to attract a variety of birds that may not reliably visit a birdfeeder containing seeds. In Texas, all common species of woodpeckers will use a suet feeder year round. In winter, yellow-rumped and orange-crowned warblers, golden-crowned kinglets and northern flickers could visit. In spring, northern oriole and other warblers may also visit.  Impact  Bird feeding in winter Feeding of seabirds in a harbor. A study conducted in Sheffield, England, found that the abundance of garden birds increased with levels of bird feeding. This effect was only apparent in those species that regularly take supplementary food, raising the possibility that bird feeding was having a direct effect on bird abundance. In contrast, the density of feeding stations had no effect on the number of different bird species present in a neighbourhood.Fuller, R.A., Warren, P.H., Armsworth, P.R., Barbosa, O. & Gaston, K.J. 2008. Garden bird feeding predicts the structure of urban avian assemblages. Diversity & Distributions 14, 131‚Äì137. The use of bird feeders has been claimed to cause environmental problems; some of these were highlighted in a front-page article in The Wall Street Journal.Sterba, James B. \\"Crying Fowl: Feeding Wild Birds May Harm Them and Environment\\", Wall Street Journal, December 27, 2002. Prior to the publication of The Wall Street Journal article, Canadian ornithologist Jason Rogers also wrote about the environmental problems associated with the use of bird feeders in the journal Alberta Naturalist.Rogers, J. 2002. Birdfeeding: Another viewpoint. Alberta Naturalist 31: 1-11. In this article, Rogers explains how the practice of feeding wild birds is inherently fraught with negative impacts and risks such as fostering dependency, altering natural distribution, density and migration patterns, interfering with ecological processes, causing malnutrition, facilitating the spread of disease and increasing the risk of death from cats, pesticides, hitting windows and other causes. In the UK, introduced eastern gray squirrels can consume significant volumes of food intended for birds. An experimental study providing supplementary food during the breeding season found that predation levels by corvids and eastern gray squirrels were higher when nests were located in close proximity to filled feeders. In a paper in the journal Oecologia, it was reported that feeding of blue tits and great tits with peanut cake over a long time period significantly reduced brood size. This was driven by smaller clutch sizes in both species and lower hatching success rates for blue tits. Studies by the University of Freiburg and Environment Canada found that blackcaps migrating to Great Britain from Germany had become adapted to eating food supplied by humans. In contrast blackcaps migrating to Spain had bills adapted to feeding on fruit such as olives. Providing supplementary food at feeding stations may also change interactions with other species. Aphids and carabid beetles are more likely to be predated by birds near bird feeders.  Economy  Large sums of money are spent by ardent bird feeders, who indulge their wild birds with a variety of bird foods and bird feeders. Over 55 million Americans over the age of 16 feed wild birds and spend more than $3 billion a year on bird food, and $800 million a year on bird feeders, bird baths, bird houses and other bird feeding accessories.\\"Survey of Fishing, Hunting, and Wildlife Associated Recreation‚ÄìNational Overview 2007.\\" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 2006. The activity has spawned an industry that sells supplies and equipment for the bird feeding hobby.

Life Marrying Shui Shifang (Chongqing, 1943) Robert van Gulik was born in Zutphen, the son of a medical officer in the Dutch army of what was then called the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia). He was born in the Netherlands, but from the age of three till twelve he lived in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta), where he was tutored in Mandarin and other languages. He went to Leiden University in 1929 and obtained his PhD in 1935 from Utrecht University. His talents as a linguist suited him for a job in the Dutch Foreign Service, which he joined in 1935; and he was then stationed in various countries, mostly in East Asia (Japan and China). He was in Tokyo when Japan declared war on the Netherlands in 1941, but he, along with the rest of the Allied diplomatic staff, was evacuated in 1942. He spent most of the rest of World War II as the secretary for the Dutch mission to Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government in Chongqing. While in Chongqing, he married a Chinese woman, Shui Shifang, the daughter of a Qing dynasty Imperial mandarin, and they had four children together. After the war ended, he returned to the Netherlands, then went to the United States as the counsellor of the Dutch Embassy in Washington, D.C. He returned to Japan in 1949 and stayed there for the next four years. While in Tokyo, he published his first two books, the translation Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee and a privately published book of erotic colored prints from the Ming dynasty. Later postings took him all over the world, from New Delhi, Kuala Lumpur, and Beirut (during the 1958 Civil War) to The Hague. In 1959 Van Gulik became correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, he resigned in 1963. In 1964 he became a full member, and the next year he became a foreign member. From 1965 until his death from cancer at The Hague in 1967, he was the Dutch ambassador to Japan. Judge Dee mysteries During World War II van Gulik translated the 18th-century detective novel Dee Goong An into English under the title Celebrated Cases of Judge Dee (first published in Tokyo in 1949). The main character of this book, Judge Dee, was based on the real statesman and detective Di Renjie, who lived in the 7th century, during the Tang Dynasty (AD 600‚Äì900), though in the novel itself elements of Ming Dynasty China (AD 1300‚Äì1600) were mixed in.Herbert, Rosemary. (1999) \\"Van Gulik, Robert H(ans)\\", in Herbert, The Oxford Companion to Crime and Mystery Writing. Oxford, Oxford University Press. .pp. 38‚Äì9. Thanks to his translation of this largely forgotten work, van Gulik became interested in Chinese detective fiction. To the translation he appended an essay on the genre in which he suggested that it was easy to imagine rewriting some of the old Chinese case histories with an eye toward modern readers. Not long afterward he himself tried his hand at creating a detective story along these lines. This became the book The Chinese Maze Murders (completed around 1950). As van Gulik thought the story would have more interest to Japanese and Chinese readers, he had it translated into Japanese by a friend (finished in 1951), and it was sold in Japan under the title Meiro-no-satsujin. With the success of the book, van Gulik produced a translation into Chinese, which was published by a Singapore book publisher in 1953. The reviews were good, and van Gulik wrote two more books (The Chinese Bell Murders and The Chinese Lake Murders) over the next few years, also with an eye toward Japanese and then Chinese editions. Next, van Gulik found a publisher for English versions of the stories, and the first such version was published in 1957. Later books were written and published in English first; the translations came afterwards. Van Gulik's intent in writing his first Judge Dee novel was, as he wrote in remarks on The Chinese Bell Murders, \\"to show modern Chinese and Japanese writers that their own ancient crime-literature has plenty of source material for detective and mystery-stories\\". In 1956, he published a translation of the T'ang-yin-pi-shih (\\"Parallel Cases from Under the Pear Tree\\"), a 13th-century casebook for district magistrates. He used many of the cases as plots in his novels (as he states in the postscripts of the novels). Van Gulik's Judge Dee mysteries follow in the long tradition of Chinese detective fiction, intentionally preserving a number of key elements of that writing culture. Most notably, he had Judge Dee solve three different (and sometimes unrelated) cases in each book, a traditional device in Chinese mysteries. The whodunit element is also less important in the Judge Dee stories than it is in the traditional Western detective story, though still more so than in traditional Chinese detective stories. Nevertheless, van Gulik's fiction was adapted to a more Western audience, avoiding the supernatural and religious traditions of Buddhism and Daoism in favour of rationality.Wright, Daniel Franklin (2004). Chinoiserie in the novels of Robert Hans van Gulik (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University Other works \\"Gibbons at play\\", painting by the Xuande Emperor (1427) Robert van Gulik studied Indisch Recht (Dutch Indies law) and Indologie (Indonesian culture) at Leiden University from 1929 until 1934, receiving his doctorate for a dissertation on the horse cult in Northeast Asia at Utrecht University. Though he made his career in the Dutch diplomatic service, he kept up his studies. During his life he wrote twenty-odd essays and monographs on various subjects, mainly but not exclusively on aspects of Chinese culture. Typically, much of his scholarly work was first published outside the Netherlands. In his lifetime van Gulik was recognized as a European expert on Imperial Chinese jurisprudence. Van Gulik was quite interested in Chinese painting. For example, in his book The Gibbon in China (1967), he devotes quite a few pages to the gibbon-themed paintings in China and Japan, from the Northern Song Dynasty on. Analyzing the portrayal of these apes throughout history, he notes how the realism of the pictures deteriorated as the gibbon population in most of China was extirpated. As an art critic, he greatly admired the portrayal of the apes by such renowned painters as Yi Yuanji and Muqi Fachang. Commenting on one of Ming Emperor Xuande's works, \\"Gibbons at Play\\", van Gulik says that while it is \\"not a great work of art\\", it is \\"ably executed\\". The lifelike images of the apes make one surmise that the emperor painted from the live models that could have been kept in the palace gardens.Van Gulik, Robert (1967).

The Kirtland Safety Society (KSS) was first proposed as a bank in 1836, and eventually organized on January 2, 1837, as a joint stock company, by leaders and followers of the Church of the Latter Day Saints. According to KSS's 1837 \\"Articles of Agreement\\", it was intended to serve the financial needs of the growing Mormon community in Kirtland, Ohio. Its preamble stated it was: > ... for the promotion of our temporal interests, and for the better > management of our different occupations, which consist in agriculture, > mechanical arts, and merchandising. However, by November 1837, KSS failed and its business closed. In the aftermath, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was fined for \\"running an illegal bank,\\" though he was employed as the institution's Cashier. While Smith appealed the fine and made arrangements to have Oliver Granger settle the affairs of the quasi-bank, many bankrupted Mormons left the church because they believed Smith had established the bank in order to enrich himself and the Mormon leadership.Adams, Chartering the Kirtland Bank. Economy in Kirtland By late 1836, many recent Latter Day Saint converts had gathered in Missouri and Kirtland, Ohio. The city of Kirtland experienced a significant population increase, growing from approximately 1,000 people in 1830 to 3,000 in 1836, with a similar increase in surrounding agricultural areas. The population growth was at least partially responsible for a rapid increase in land prices between 1832 and 1837. The average price per acre of land sold in Kirtland rose from approximately $7 in 1832 to $44 in 1837, only to fall back to $17.50 in 1839. (Ludlow, p. 283) Generalized inflation during the period accounted for between 25 and 40 percent of the price increase. Although the church held considerable real estate, estimated at approximately $60,000 in equity by historian Larry T. Wimmer, it also needed liquidity to repay outstanding loans. The credit needs of the church, growing population and ongoing land transactions required a local bank. Banks in the United States in the period before the Civil War issued and often backed their own currency. KSS organization A Kirtland Safety Society bank note for five dollars. After some discussion by the leadership of the Church, church apostle Orson Hyde went to the Ohio legislature to request a bank charter while Oliver Cowdery went to Philadelphia and acquired plates to print notes for the proposed Kirtland Safety Society bank. On January 2, Hyde returned to Kirtland empty-handed. He had been unable to persuade any legislator to sponsor a bill giving KSS a bank charter. Church president and founder Joseph Smith attributed the lack of sponsorship to disfavor toward the Mormons.Hill, Rooker, and Wimmer, p. 437. Hyde returned to the Ohio legislature in February with a petition, joined by several non-Mormons, for a bank based on far less capital stock. This time Hyde secured legislative sponsors, and the request was added as an amendment to another bill. However, the bill was defeated by the Ohio legislature. Grandison Newell, a professed antagonist to the Latter Day Saints in general and its president in particular, instigated several lawsuits against the Mormons in Ohio. Newell was close to three legislators who had taken the charter requests under consideration and used his influence to dissuade them.Hill, Rooker, and Wimmer, p. 441. Although this rejection has been attributed to both political and religious differences, this Ohio legislature was much more restrictive in issuing bank charters than the previous legislative body. The legislature was now dominated by the hard money wing of the Democratic party, the \\"Jacksonian Democrats\\". Due to their influence, the legislature refused all applications for bank charters but one during 1836 and 1837, in part because of endemic nationwide problems with land speculation, wildcat banking and counterfeiting. Under the advice of non- Mormon legal counsel, the Kirtland Safety Society Anti-Banking Company (KSSABC) was formed under revised articles on January 2, 1837 as a joint stock company to serve as a quasi-banking institution.Adams, p. 468; Hill, Rooker, and Wimmer, pp. 433-434. Quasi-banks operated as banks (sometimes in conjunction with other business activities) although they had no formal bank charter. These corporate institutions were not uncommon in Ohio at the time as banking regulations were limited. Whigs went so far as to encourage businesses to operate as quasi-banks. Even after the national bank failure in 1837, there was no widespread opposition to quasi-banks in Ohio until 1873.Adams, pp. 469-70; Hill, Rooker, and Wimmer, pp. 433-434. \\"Anti\\" and \\"ing\\" were engraved before and after \\"Bank\\"‚Äîin smaller typeface‚Äîon the printing plates Cowdery had previously purchased in Philadelphia. Subscribers and organizers of the KSSABC were members of the Kirtland community (merchants, farmers, etc.), many of whom became shareholders of the company. Sidney Rigdon served as the KSSABC's chairman and president, Warren Parrish as signatory, secretary and teller; Joseph Smith was cashier. Supporters hoped that they would eventually be able to secure a formal banking charter. In the interim, the KSSABC began issuing notes as a quasi-bank in early January 1837. The proposed capitalization of the \\"anti-bank\\" greatly exceeded the resources that were available from its backers, as noted by historian, Robert Kent Fielding: > As it was projected, there was never the slightest chance that the Kirtland > Safety Society anti-Bank-ing Company could succeed. Even though their > economy was in jeopardy, it could scarcely have suffered such a devastating > blow as that which they were themselves preparing to administer to it. ... > The Safety Society proposed no modest project befitting its relative worth > and ability to pay. Its organizers launched, instead, a gigantic company > capitalized at four million dollars, when the entire capitalization of all > the banks in the state of Ohio was only nine and one third million. Such > presumption could not have escaped the notice of bankers who would have been > led to examine its capital structure more closely. ... according to the > articles of incorporation capital stock was to be paid in by subscription > but that the amount of payments were left to the discretion of the company > managers. Furthermore, total issuance of notes was not prescribed, nor was > the relation of notes to capital and assets. The members, to be sure, > pledged themselves to redeem the notes and bound themselves individually by > their agreement under the penal sum of one hundred thousand dollars. But > there was no transfer of property deeds, no power of attorney, no legal > pains and penalties. To a banker, the articles fairly shouted: 'this is a > wildcat, beware!' National bank crisis The KSS failure, although unique in some ways, was part of a national bank crisis known as the Panic of 1837 that began in May of that year. Underlying causes of the nationwide financial panic included speculative and inflationary selling of public lands in western states like Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. The economic policies of the previous President Andrew Jackson, including the Specie Circular and the withdrawal of government funds from the Second Bank of the United States, also contributed to the crisis. On May 10, 1837 in New York, every chartered bank stopped payment in specie (gold and silver coinage), leaving banks and local institutions like the KSS holding notes without adequate liquid assets. Within two months the failures in New York alone aggregated nearly $100,000,000 in value. \\"Out of eight hundred and fifty banks in the United States, three hundred and forty- three closed entirely, sixty-two failed partially, and the system of State banks received a shock from which it never fully recovered.\\"The financial panic of 1837, The Great Republic by the Master Historians, edited by Hubert H. Bancroft, as found at publicbookshelf.com Smaller, privately held financial institutions, like the KSS, also failed in droves. The Panic was followed by a five-year depression, characterized by ongoing failures of banks and financial institutions and record unemployment levels. Opposition and failure In February 1837, at the behest of Newell, Samuel D. Rounds swore a writ against Smith and Rigdon for illegal banking and issuing unauthorized bank paper. At a hearing in March, this trial was postponed until autumn. Eventually Rounds voluntarily dropped all of the cases in his suit except those against Smith and Rigdon. Although Smith's only official capacity for KSSABC was cashier, other officers and parties with equal or greater responsibility were absolved from the suit. KSSABC continued issuing notes through June, but eventually failed due to insolvency, as most of the KSSABC reserves were tied up in land rather than silver as some erroneously believed. Smith transferred all of his holdings to Oliver Granger and J. Carter in June and resigned from the KSSABC in July. Parrish and Frederick G. Williams assumed management of the KSSABC until the institution closed its doors in November with about $100,000 in unresolved debt. Smith appointed Granger as his agent to clear up his Kirtland affairs, as Smith was named in seventeen lawsuits with claims totalling $30,206.44 over debts incurred in the failure of the KSSABC. According to LDS Church scholars, \\"Four of these suits were settled; three were voluntarily discontinued by the plaintiffs; and ten resulted in judgments against Joseph Smith and others. Of these ten judgments, three were satisfied in full, three were satisfied in part, and only four were wholly unsatisfied.\\" The church also raised and put up $38,000 in bail money for Smith at the Geauga County Court which was to be held to satisfy any judgment that might be rendered against Smith.Hill, Rooker, and Wimmer, p. 419. On July 28, Smith, Rigdon and Thomas B. Marsh headed to Upper Canada on church business and returned in late August. On September 27, Smith and Rigdon departed Kirtland for Missouri. They arrived about one month later, spent about two weeks in Missouri on Church business and returned to Kirtland on December 10. In their absence, in October, they were fined $1,000 for operating an illegal bank. According to Dale W. Adams, professor of agricultural economics at Ohio State University, other, larger quasi-banks had been operating in Ohio longer than KSSABC and were not being prosecuted. Among KSSABC's misfortunes, Smith also accused Parrish of embezzling $25,000 from KSSABC. In June Smith sought a search warrant to confirm the allegations against Parrish but was denied. Response in the Latter Day Saint community After Parrish started to stir up the Latter Day Saint community, many church members (including Church leaders) became disillusioned with the failure of the KSSABC and left the Church or were disfellowshipped or excommunicated. In May 1837, disgruntled church members (including Church leaders) and non-members alike began to publicly blame Smith for their losses. Some members, like Parley P. Pratt and Cowdery, were later reconciled to Smith and the church. Smith warned the community against speculation and counterfeiting. Shortly after his resignation from the KSSABC in July he stated in the August 1837 Messenger and Advocate: > I am disposed to say a word relative to the bills of the Kirtland Safety > Society Bank. I hereby warn them to beware of speculators, renegadoes > [defectors] and gamblers, who are duping the unsuspecting and the unwary, by > palming upon them, those bills, which are of no worth, here. I > discountenance and disapprove of any and all such practices. I know them to > be detrimental to the best interests of society, as well as to the > principles of religion.Joseph Smith, \\"Caution,\\" Latter Day Saints' Messenger > and Advocate 3/11 (August 1837), 560. Shortly before his resignation, Smith also took out a $1,225 loan from a separate bank to help keep KSSABC solvent. Smith publicly denied claims that the KSSABC was created for the purpose of surreptitiously enriching the church leadership, but many disaffected members felt otherwise. Regardless of the reasons for the KSSABC's failure, much of the blame was laid upon Smith. Half of The Quorum of Twelve Apostles accused Smith of improprieties in the banking scandal, and church Apostle Heber C. Kimball later said that the bank's failure was so shattering that afterwards \\"there were not twenty persons on earth that would declare that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.\\"Heber C. Kimball, \\"Emigration‚ÄîThe Saints Warned to Repent or Judgements Will Come Upon Them\\", Journal of Discourses 4:108 (September 28, 1856). Woodruff records that Smith had an alleged revelation on the topic, but declined to share it, saying only that \\"if we would give heed to the commandments the Lord had given this morning all would be well.\\" Then Woodruff expresses his own hopes that the KSSABC will \\"become the greatest of all institutions on EARTH.\\"The Kirtland Diary of Wilford Woodruff by Dean C. Jessee Fn, BYU Studies, vol. 12 (1971-1972), Number 4 - Summer 1972, p. 381. On January 12, 1838, faced with a warrant for his arrest on a charge of illegal banking, Smith fled with Rigdon to Clay County, Missouri just ahead of an armed group out to capture and hold Smith for trial. Smith and Rigdon were both acquainted with not only conflict and violent mobbing they experienced together in Pennsylvania and New York, but with fleeing from the law. According to Smith, they left \\"to escape mob violence, which was about to burst upon us under the color of legal process to cover the hellish designs of our enemies.\\" Brigham Young left Kirtland for Missouri weeks earlier on December 22 to avoid the dissidents who were angry with Young and threatened him because of his persistent public defense of Smith's innocence. Most of those who remained committed to the church moved to join the main body of the church in Missouri. Kirtland Safety Society notes One of the tangible connections from this episode to the present are the notes that were printed at the time. Some church leaders encouraged people to hold onto these notes as they said that someday they would have value again. While the notes never regained their face value, by the late 19th century they had become collector's items.Adams, footnote 33. A Kirtland Safety Society note bearing Joseph Smith's signature can be quite valuable; for example, in an auction in March 2006, a $100 note sold for $11,500 (about a 3% per year gain).Smythe Spring Sale Prices Strong from www.news- antique.com.

S. (1988). Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Quantitative Genetics (p. 537). Sinauer Associates. ‚Äå An auto mechanic who fixes an engine by recalling another car that exhibited similar symptoms is using case-based reasoning. A lawyer who advocates a particular outcome in a trial based on legal precedents or a judge who creates case law is using case-based reasoning. So, too, an engineer copying working elements of nature (practicing biomimicry), is treating nature as a database of solutions to problems. Case- based reasoning is a prominent type of analogy solution making. It has been argued that case-based reasoning is not only a powerful method for computer reasoning, but also a pervasive behavior in everyday human problem solving; or, more radically, that all reasoning is based on past cases personally experienced. This view is related to prototype theory, which is most deeply explored in cognitive science.  Process  Case-based reasoning has been formalized for purposes of computer reasoning as a four-step process:Agnar Aamodt and Enric Plaza, \\"Case-Based Reasoning: Foundational Issues, Methodological Variations, and System Approaches,\\" Artificial Intelligence Communications 7 (1994): 1, 39-52. # Retrieve: Given a target problem, retrieve from memory cases relevant to solving it. A case consists of a problem, its solution, and, typically, annotations about how the solution was derived. For example, suppose Fred wants to prepare blueberry pancakes. Being a novice cook, the most relevant experience he can recall is one in which he successfully made plain pancakes. The procedure he followed for making the plain pancakes, together with justifications for decisions made along the way, constitutes Fred's retrieved case. # Reuse: Map the solution from the previous case to the target problem. This may involve adapting the solution as needed to fit the new situation. In the pancake example, Fred must adapt his retrieved solution to include the addition of blueberries. # Revise: Having mapped the previous solution to the target situation, test the new solution in the real world (or a simulation) and, if necessary, revise. Suppose Fred adapted his pancake solution by adding blueberries to the batter. After mixing, he discovers that the batter has turned blue ‚Äì an undesired effect. This suggests the following revision: delay the addition of blueberries until after the batter has been ladled into the pan. # Retain: After the solution has been successfully adapted to the target problem, store the resulting experience as a new case in memory. Fred, accordingly, records his new-found procedure for making blueberry pancakes, thereby enriching his set of stored experiences, and better preparing him for future pancake-making demands.  Comparison to other methods  At first glance, CBR may seem similar to the rule induction algorithmsRule-induction algorithms are procedures for learning rules for a given concept by generalizing from examples of that concept. For example, a rule-induction algorithm might learn rules for forming the plural of English nouns from examples such as dog/dogs, fly/flies, and ray/rays. of machine learning. Like a rule-induction algorithm, CBR starts with a set of cases or training examples; it forms generalizations of these examples, albeit implicit ones, by identifying commonalities between a retrieved case and the target problem. If for instance a procedure for plain pancakes is mapped to blueberry pancakes, a decision is made to use the same basic batter and frying method, thus implicitly generalizing the set of situations under which the batter and frying method can be used. The key difference, however, between the implicit generalization in CBR and the generalization in rule induction lies in when the generalization is made. A rule-induction algorithm draws its generalizations from a set of training examples before the target problem is even known; that is, it performs eager generalization. For instance, if a rule-induction algorithm were given recipes for plain pancakes, Dutch apple pancakes, and banana pancakes as its training examples, it would have to derive, at training time, a set of general rules for making all types of pancakes. It would not be until testing time that it would be given, say, the task of cooking blueberry pancakes. The difficulty for the rule-induction algorithm is in anticipating the different directions in which it should attempt to generalize its training examples. This is in contrast to CBR, which delays (implicit) generalization of its cases until testing time ‚Äì a strategy of lazy generalization. In the pancake example, CBR has already been given the target problem of cooking blueberry pancakes; thus it can generalize its cases exactly as needed to cover this situation. CBR therefore tends to be a good approach for rich, complex domains in which there are myriad ways to generalize a case. In law, there is often explicit delegation of CBR to courts, recognizing the limits of rule based reasons: limiting delay, limited knowledge of future context, limit of negotiated agreement, etc. While CBR in law and cognitively inspired CBR have long been associated, the former is more clearly an interpolation of rule based reasoning, and judgment, while the latter is more closely tied to recall and process adaptation. The difference is clear in their attitude toward error and appellate review.  Criticism  Critics of CBR argue that it is an approach that accepts anecdotal evidence as its main operating principle. Without statistically relevant data for backing and implicit generalization, there is no guarantee that the generalization is correct. However, all inductive reasoning where data is too scarce for statistical relevance is inherently based on anecdotal evidence. There is recent work that develops CBR within a statistical framework and formalizes case-based inference as a specific type of probabilistic inference; thus, it becomes possible to produce case-based predictions equipped with a certain level of confidence.Eyke H√ºllermeier. Case-Based Approximate Reasoning. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 2007. One description of the difference between CBR and induction from instances is that statistical inference aims to find what tends to make cases similar while CBR aims to encode what suffices to claim similarly. Wilson, Robert Andrew, and Frank C. Keil, eds. The MIT encyclopedia of the cognitive sciences. MIT press, 2001.  History  CBR traces its roots to the work of Roger Schank and his students at Yale University in the early 1980s. Schank's model of dynamic memoryRoger Schank, Dynamic Memory: A Theory of Learning in Computers and People (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982). was the basis for the earliest CBR systems: Janet Kolodner's CYRUSJanet Kolodner, \\"Reconstructive Memory: A Computer Model,\\" Cognitive Science 7 (1983): 4. and Michael Lebowitz's IPP.Michael Lebowitz, \\"Memory- Based Parsing ,\\" Artificial Intelligence 21 (1983), 363-404. Other schools of CBR and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s, which directed at topics such as legal reasoning, memory-based reasoning (a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines), and combinations of CBR with other reasoning methods. In the 1990s, interest in CBR grew internationally, as evidenced by the establishment of an International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning in 1995, as well as European, German, British, Italian, and other CBR workshops. CBR technology has resulted in the deployment of a number of successful systems, the earliest being Lockheed's CLAVIER,Bill Mark, \\"Case- Based Reasoning for Autoclave Management,\\" Proceedings of the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop (1989). a system for laying out composite parts to be baked in an industrial convection oven.

Design competitions can be technical or purely aesthetic. The objective of technical competitions is to introduce students to real-world engineering situations and to teach students project-management and fabrication techniques used in industry. Aesthetic competitions usually require art and design skills. Both students and industry benefit from intercollegiate design competitions. Each competition allows students to apply the theories and information they have learning in the class room to real situations. Industry gains better prepared and more experienced engineers.  History  Through the 1970s only one competition of significance existed: Mini Baja. Today, almost every field of engineering has several design competitions, which have extended from college down into high school (e.g., FIRST Robotics) and even younger grades (e.g., FIRST Lego League).

It is a live action show mixed with claymation animated dinosaurs. During its original run, it was broadcast on the NBC television network. It later aired in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the \\"Krofft Superstars\\" package. In 1985, it returned to late Saturday mornings on CBS as a replacement for the canceled Pryor's Place (also a Krofft production) followed by another brief return to CBS in the summer of 1985. It was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel in the 1990s. Reruns of this series were aired on Saturday mornings on Me-TV and are streamed online at any time on their website. It has since become a cult classic and is now available on DVD. Krofft Productions remade the series in 1991, also titled Land of the Lost, and a big-budget film adaptation was released in 2009. Overview Land of the Lost details the adventures of the Marshall family (father Rick and his children Will and Holly), who are trapped in an alternate universe or time warp inhabited by dinosaurs, a primate-type people called Pakuni, and aggressive humanoid/lizard creatures called Sleestak. The series opens with a theme song accompanied by a banjo like instrument and a synthesizer. The episode storylines focus on the family's efforts to survive and find a way back to their own world, but the exploration of the exotic inhabitants of the Land of the Lost is also an ongoing part of the story. An article on renewed studio interest in feature-film versions of Land of the Lost and H.R. Pufnstuf commented that \\"decision-makers in Hollywood, and some big-name stars, have personal recollections of plopping down on the family- room wall-to-wall shag sometime between 1969 and 1974 to tune in to multiple reruns of the Kroffts' Saturday morning live-action hits,\\" and quoting Marty Krofft as saying that the head of Universal Studios, Ronald Meyer, and leaders at Sony Pictures all had been fans of Krofft programs. A number of well- respected writers in the science-fiction field contributed scripts to the series (mostly in the first and second seasons), including Larry Niven, Theodore Sturgeon, Ben Bova, and Norman Spinrad, and a number of people involved with Star Trek, such as D.C. Fontana, Walter Koenig, and David Gerrold. Gerrold, Niven, and Fontana also contributed commentaries to the DVD of the first season. The prolific Krofft team was influential in live-action children's television, producing many shows that were oddly formatted, highly energetic, and filled with special effects, with most of them following a \\"stranger in a strange land\\" storyline. Most of these shows were comedic in nature, but Land of the Lost was considerably more serious, especially during its first season, though as the series progressed, the dramatic tone diminished. =Plot and format= The Marshalls are brought to the mysterious world by means of a dimensional portal, a device used frequently throughout the series and a major part of its internal mythology. This portal opens when they are swept down a gigantic 1,000-foot waterfall. In \\"Circle\\", which explains the time paradox, this portal is actually opened by Rick Marshall himself, while in Enik's cave, as a way for the current Marshalls to return to Earth, resolving the paradox and allowing Enik to also return to his time. Outfitted only for a short camping trip, the resourceful family from California takes shelter in a natural cave and improvises the provisions and tools that they need to survive. Their most common and dangerous encounters are with dinosaurs, particularly a Tyrannosaurus rex they nickname \\"Grumpy\\", which frequents the location of their cave. However, many of the dinosaurs are herbivores, posing no threat to the Marshalls, unless unintentionally provoked. One is a particularly tame young Brontosaurus that Holly nicknames \\"Dopey\\", and upon which Holly looks as a pet. They also encounter the mostly hostile Sleestak (lizard men), and the primate-like creatures called Pakuni (one of whom, Cha-Ka, they befriend), as well as a variety of dangerous creatures, strange geography and unfamiliar technology. The main goal of the three is to find a way to return home. They are occasionally aided in this by the Altrusian castaway Enik. At the start of the third season, Rick Marshall (played by Spencer Milligan) is explained to have been accidentally returned to Earth alone, leaving his children behind. Rick is immediately replaced by his brother Jack. Rick Marshall abruptly disappeared while trying to use one of the pylons to get home; Jack stumbled upon his niece and nephew after he embarked on a search of his own to find them. Though the term \\"time doorway\\" is used throughout the series, Land of the Lost is not meant to portray an era in Earth's history, but rather an enigmatic zone whose place and time are unknown. Indeed, within the first few minutes of the pilot, the Marshall family father tells his children that he spotted three moons in the sky. The original creators of these time portals were thought to be the ancestors of the Sleestak, called Altrusians, though later episodes raised some questions about this. Many aspects of the Land of the Lost, including the time doorways and environmental processes, were controlled by the Pylons, metallic obelisk- shaped booths that were larger on the inside than the outside and housed matrix tables ‚Äì stone tables studded with a grid of colored crystals. Uncontrolled time doorways result in the arrival of a variety of visitors and castaways in the land.

To support the internal mythology, linguist Victoria Fromkin was commissioned to create a special language for the Pakuni, which she based on the sounds of West African speech and attempted to build into the show in a gradual way that would allow viewers to learn the language over the course of many episodes. The series' intention was to create a realistic fantasy world, albeit relying heavily on children's acceptance of minor inconsistencies. In a 1999 interview, first-season story editor and writer David Gerrold claimed that he largely created the show based on photographs of various science-fiction topoi that were bound together in a book and given him by Sid Krofft and Allan Foshko. It was a marked departure from the Krofft team's previous work, which mostly featured extremely stylized puppets and sets such as those in H.R. Pufnstuf and Lidsville. The series for the first two seasons was shot on a modular indoor soundstage at General Service Studios in Hollywood, and made economical use of a small number of sets and scenic props that were rearranged frequently to suggest the ostensibly vast jungles, ancient cities, and cave systems. As is traditional in many effect scenes, miniatures or scale-version settings were used for insertion of live-action scenes. Additional locations were often rendered using scale miniatures and chroma key. Spencer Milligan departed the show at the beginning of its third season for financial reasons. In addition to a salary increase, he believed the rest of the cast and he should receive compensation for using their images on various merchandise. His character Rick Marshall was replaced by his brother, Jack Marshall, played by actor Ron Harper. Milligan did not return for the brief scene, also shown in the credits of the third season, showing Rick Marshall being transported out of the Land of the Lost. One of the show's crew played the role, instead, wearing a wig resembling Milligan's hair and standing with his back to the camera. Nonhuman characters were portrayed by actors in latex rubber suits or heavy creature makeup. Dinosaurs in the series were created using a combination of stop motion animation miniatures, rear-projection film effects, and occasional hand puppets for close-ups of dinosaur heads. Wesley Eure points out on a commentary track for Land of the Lost's first-season DVD that the Grumpy hand puppet has no hole in the back of its throat, though it is often seen opening its mouth wide to roar. The series marked a rare example of matting filmed stop-motion sequences with videotape live action, so as to avoid the telltale blue 'fringe' produced in matting with less exacting processes. Though this occasionally worked very well, the difference in lighting between the video and film sequences sometimes brought inadvertent attention to the limitations of the process. Special-effects footage was frequently reused. Additional visual effects were achieved using manual film overlay techniques, the low- tech ancestor to current motion-control photography. Home media From 2004 to 2005, Rhino Entertainment owned the rights to the show, and released seasons one through three, and a complete series package, with several bonus features, including commentaries, on all of the releases. The DVDs of the series earned a Saturn nomination for best retro TV series release in 2004. On May 26, 2009, Universal Studios released two complete series releases, one in original packaging, and the other enclosed in a reproduction of the Land of the Lost vintage '70s lunchbox; the only bonus feature was a look at the film starring Will Ferrell. On October 13, 2009, Universal released the three seasons individually; the DVDs are identical to Universal's Complete Series Boxes. (However, the Region 4 version of the 2009 box set does include the commentaries and interviews, but not the look at the Ferrell film). The series is also available in digital media format. Remakes Despite a relatively short run, the show continued to be aired extensively through syndication. Based on that success, a remake of the series began in 1991 and ran for two seasons. On June 5, 2009 a feature film based on the 1974 TV series opened in U.S. theaters. Unlike the original series, which was a serious take on the story, the film was a comedy/parody. It was directed by Brad Silberling and starred Will Ferrell, with the Krofft brothers serving as co-producers. Although the original series was aimed for children, the film's target audience was adults. In 2015, Sid and Marty Krofft reportedly were working on a reboot to Land of the Lost following what they called \\"that other movie\\".http://comicbook.com/2015/07/12/sid-and-marty-krofft-talk-the-land-of- the-lost-reboot----and-the/ In a 2018 podcast interview with both Sid and Marty Krofft, they reconfirmed that they are still working on an updated remake to Land Of The Lost and that this time it will be an hour-long series.

The grape most likely gets its name from the French words sauvage (\\"wild\\") and blanc (\\"white\\") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 52 Workman Publishing 2001 It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white varietal wine. The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Romania, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Bulgaria, the states of Washington and California in the US. Some New World Sauvignon blancs, particularly from California, may also be called \\"Fum√© Blanc\\", a marketing term coined by Robert Mondavi in reference to Pouilly-Fum√©. Depending on the climate, the flavor can range from aggressively grassy to sweetly tropical. In cooler climates, the grape has a tendency to produce wines with noticeable acidity and \\"green flavors\\" of grass, green bell peppers and nettles with some tropical fruit (such as passion fruit) and floral (such as elderflower) notes. In warmer climates, it can develop more tropical fruit notes but risks losing much aroma from over-ripeness, leaving only slight grapefruit and tree fruit (such as peach) notes.Wine & Spirits Education Trust \\"Wine and Spirits: Understanding Wine Quality\\" pgs 6-9, Second Revised Edition (2012), London, Wine experts have used the phrase \\"crisp, elegant, and fresh\\" as a favorable description of Sauvignon blanc from the Loire Valley and New Zealand.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible pg 268 Workman Publishing 2001 Materman, \\"Stuff of legends: Marlborough Sauvignon blanc.\\" Sauvignon blanc, when slightly chilled, pairs well with fish or cheese, particularly ch√®vre. It is also known as one of the few wines that can pair well with sushi.Robert Joseph and Margaret Rand, KISS Guide to Wine DK Pub 2000 Along with Riesling, Sauvignon blanc was one of the first fine wines to be bottled with a screwcap in commercial quantities, especially by New Zealand producers. The wine is usually consumed young, as it does not particularly benefit from aging, as varietal Sauvignon blancs tend to develop vegetal aromas reminiscent of peas and asparagus with extended aging. Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-L√©ognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fum√© and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential. The first Friday in May is International Sauvignon Blanc Day. History The first plantings of Sauvignon blanc were introduced to California at Cresta Blanca Winery (pictured) in the Livermore Valley. The Sauvignon blanc grape traces its origins to western France in the Loire Valley and Bordeaux Regions. As noted above, it is not clear that the vine originated in western France. Ongoing research suggests it may have descended from Savagnin. It has also been associated with the Carmenere family. At some point in the 18th century, the vine paired with Cabernet Franc to parent the Cabernet Sauvignon vine in Bordeaux. In the 19th century, plantings in Bordeaux were often interspersed with Sauvignon vert (In Chile, known as Sauvignonasse) as well as the Sauvignon blanc pink mutation Sauvignon gris. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, the insect plague which devastated French vineyards in the 19th century, these interspersed cuttings were transported to Chile where the field blends are still common today. Despite the similarity in names, Sauvignon blanc has no known relation to the Sauvignon ros√© mutation found in the Loire Valley of France.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 221 Harcourt Books 2001 The first cuttings of Sauvignon blanc were brought to California by Charles Wetmore, founder of Cresta Blanca Winery, in the 1880s.Wine Pros Sauvignon blanc These cuttings came from the Sauternes vineyards of Ch√¢teau d'Yquem. The plantings produced well in Livermore Valley. Eventually, the wine acquired the alias of \\"Fum√© Blanc\\" in California by promotion of Robert Mondavi in 1968. The grape was first introduced to New Zealand in the 1970s as an experimental planting to be blended with M√ºller- Thurgau.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 225 Harcourt Books 2001 Climate and geography Vineyards in Sancerre will often plant roses around Sauvignon blanc vines as an early detector of powdery mildew. The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, which allows it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to overwhelming heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, the grape flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, the grape will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity. Rising global temperatures have caused farmers to harvest the grapes earlier than they have in the past.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 222 Harcourt Books 2001 The grape originated in France, in the regions of Bordeaux and the Loire Valley.Wine Lover's Page, \\"Sauvignon blanc\\" Plantings in California, Australia, Chile and South Africa are also extensive, and Sauvignon blanc is steadily increasing in popularity as white wine drinkers seek alternatives to Chardonnay. The grape can also be found in Italy and Central Europe. Wine regions=France= A Pouilly Fum√© from the Loire Valley. In France, Sauvignon blanc is grown in the maritime climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-L√©ognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) as well as the continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fum√©, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important in the development of the intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The gravel soil found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines. Pouilly Fum√© originate from the town of Pouilly-sur- Loire, located directly across the Loire River from the commune of Sancerre. The soil here is very flinty with deposits of limestone which the locals believed imparted a smoky, gun flint flavor to the wine and hence Fum√©, the French word for \\"smoky\\" was attached to the wine.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 272 Workman Publishing 2001 Along with S√©millon, Muscadelle and Ugni blanc, Sauvignon blanc is one of only four white grapes allowed in the production of white Bordeaux wine. Mostly used as a blending grape, Sauvignon blanc is the principal grape in Ch√¢teau Margaux's Pavillon Blanc,K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 123 Workman Publishing 2001 In the northern Rh√¥ne Valley, Sauvignon Blanc is often blended with Tressallier to form a tart white wine.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 120 Mitchell Beazley 1986 A dry white Bordeaux made from a blend of Sauvignon blanc and S√©millon. In the Sauternes region, the grape is blended with S√©millon to make the late harvest wine, Sauternes. The composition of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Sup√©rieur Ch√¢teau d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of S√©millon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1‚Äì2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 124 Mitchell Beazley 1986 Near the edge of the Chablis commune is an AOC called Saint-Bris that is gaining attention for its Sauvignon blanc production.M. Kramer Saved by Sauvignon The Wine Spectator pg 36 July 31st, 2007 =Australia= In Australia, particularly the Margaret River region, the grape is often blended with S√©millon. Varietal styles, made from only the Sauvignon blanc grape, from Adelaide Hills and Padthaway have a style distinctive from their New Zealand neighbors that tend to be more ripe in flavor with white peach and lime notes and slightly higher acidity. =Chile and Brazil= In the early 1990s, ampelographers began to distinguish Sauvignon blanc from Sauvignonasse plantings in Chile. The character of non- blended Chilean Sauvignon blanc are noticeably less acidic than the wines of New Zealand and more similar to the French style that is typical of Chilean wines. The region of Valpara√≠so is the most notable area for Sauvignon blanc in Chile due to its cooler climate which allows the grapes to be picked up to six weeks later than in other parts of Chile. In Brazil, ampelographers have discovered that the vines called Sauvignon blanc planted in the region are really Seyval blanc. =New Zealand= A Sauvignon blanc from Marlborough. In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc wines from the maritime climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough wine region, sandy soils over slate shingles have become the most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that are planted north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, and the types of harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc. The long narrow geography of the South Island ensures that no vineyard is more than from the coast. The cool, maritime climate of the area allows for a long and steady growing season in which the grapes can ripen and develop a natural balance of acids and sugars. This brings out the flavors and intensity that distinguish New Zealand Sauvignon blancs.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 807 Workman Publishing 2001 More recently, Waipara in the South Island and Gisborne and Hawkes Bay in the North Island have been attracting attention for their Sauvignon blanc releases, which often exhibit subtle differences to those from Marlborough. The asparagus, gooseberry and green flavor commonly associated with New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is derived from flavor compounds known as methoxypyrazines that becomes more pronounced and concentrated in wines from cooler climate regions. Riper flavors such as passion fruit, along with other notes such as boxwood, may be driven by thiol concentrations. =North America= A Sauvignon blanc from the Yakima Valley of Washington State. A California Sauvignon blanc. In North America, California is the leading producer of Sauvignon blanc with plantings also found in Washington state and on the Niagara Peninsula and Okanagan Valley in Canada. Sauvignon Blanc is also grown in small regions in Ohio along Lake Erie and the Ohio River. In California wine produced from the Sauvignon blanc grape is also known as Fum√© Blanc. This California wine was first made by Napa Valley's Robert Mondavi Winery in 1968. Mondavi had been offered a crop of particularly good Sauvignon blanc grapes by a grower. At that time the variety had a poor reputation in California due to its grassy flavor and aggressive aromas. Mondavi decided to try to tame that aggressiveness with barrel agings and released the wine under the name Fum√© Blanc as an allusion to the French Pouilly-Fum√©. The usage of the term is primarily a marketing base one with California wine makers choosing whichever name they prefer. Both oaked and unoaked Sauvignon blanc wines have been marketed under the name Fum√© Blanc.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 647 Workman Publishing 2001 California Sauvignon blancs tend to fall into two styles. The New Zealand-influenced Sauvignon blanc have more grassy undertones with citrus and passion fruit notes. The Mondavi-influenced Fum√© Blanc are more round with melon notes. =Other areas= Sauvignon blanc is also beginning to gain prominence in areas like South Africa's Stellenbosch and Durbanville and Italy's Collio Goriziano areas. It is also one of the main ingredients in Muffato della Sala, one of Italy's most celebrated sweet wines. Viticulture Sauvignon blanc vineyards in Marlborough, New Zealand, demonstrating restrictive pruning practices. Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile harvest the grapes at various intervals for the different blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine. Sauvignon blanc can be greatly influenced by decisions in the winemaking process. One decision is the amount of contact that the must has with the skins of the grape. In the early years of the New Zealand wine industry, there were no wineries in the South Island, which meant that freshly harvested grapes had to be trucked and then ferried to the North Island, often all the way up to Auckland. This allowed for prolonged exposure of the skins and juice which sharpened the intensity and pungency of the wine. Some winemakers, like the Loire, intentionally leave a small amount of must to spend some time in contact with the skin for later blending purposes. Other winemakers, like in California, generally avoid any contact with the skin due to the reduced aging ability of the resulting wine.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 223 Harcourt Books 2001 A Sauvignon blanc from Washington State labeled as a Fume blanc. Another important decision is the temperature of fermentation. French winemakers prefer warmer fermentations (around 16-18 ¬∞C) that bring out the mineral flavors in the wine while New World winemakers prefer slightly colder temperatures to bring out more fruit and tropical flavors. A small minority of Loire winemakers will put the wine through malolactic fermentation, a practice more often associated with New Zealand wines. Oak aging can have a pronounced effect on the wine, with the oak rounding out the flavors and softening the naturally high acidity of the grape. Some winemakers, like those in New Zealand and Sancerre, prefer stainless steel fermentation tanks over barrels with the intention of maintaining the sharp focus and flavor intensity.K.

A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. Historical development=Medieval era to 18th century= The master's degree dates back to the origin of European universities, with a Papal bull of 1233 decreeing that anyone admitted to the mastership in the University of Toulouse should be allowed to teach freely in any other university. The original meaning of the master's degree was thus that someone who had been admitted to the rank (degree) of master (i.e. teacher) in one university should be admitted to the same rank in other universities. This gradually became formalised as the (licence to teach). Originally, masters and doctors were not distinguished, but by the 15th century it had become customary in the English universities to refer to the teachers in the lower faculties (arts and grammar) as masters and those in the higher faculties as doctors. Initially, the Bachelor of Arts (BA) was awarded for the study of the trivium and the Master of Arts (MA) for the study of the quadrivium. From the late Middle Ages until the nineteenth century, the pattern of degrees was therefore to have a bachelor's and master's degree in the lower faculties and to have bachelor's and doctorates in the higher faculties. In the United States, the first master's degrees (, or Master of Arts) were awarded at Harvard University soon after its foundation. In Scotland, the pre-Reformation universities (St Andrews, Glasgow, and Aberdeen) developed so that the Scottish MA became their first degree, while in Oxford, Cambridge and Trinity College, Dublin, the MA was awarded to BA graduates of a certain standing without further examination from the late seventeenth century, its main purpose being to confer full membership of the university. At Harvard the 1700 regulations required that candidates for the master's degree had to pass a public examination, but by 1835 this was awarded Oxbridge-style three years after the BA. =Nineteenth century= The nineteenth century saw a great expansion in the variety of master's degrees offered. At the start of the century, the only master's degree was the MA, and this was normally awarded without any further study or examination. The Master in Surgery degree was introduced by the University of Glasgow in 1815. By 1861 this had been adopted throughout Scotland as well as by Cambridge and Durham in England and the University of Dublin in Ireland. When the Philadelphia College of Surgeons was established in 1870, it too conferred the Master of Surgery, \\"the same as that in Europe\\". In Scotland, Edinburgh maintained separate BA and MA degrees until the mid-nineteenth century, although there were major doubts as to the quality of the Scottish degrees of this period. In 1832 Lord Brougham, the Lord Chancellor and an alumnus of the University of Edinburgh, told the House of Lords that \\"In England the Universities conferred degrees after a considerable period of residence, after much labour performed, and if they were not in all respects so rigorous as the statutes of the Universities required, nevertheless it could not be said, that Masters of Arts were created at Oxford and Cambridge as they were in Scotland, without any residence, or without some kind of examination. In Scotland, all the statutes of the Universities which enforced conditions on the grant of degrees were a dead letter.\\" It was not until 1837 that separate examinations were reintroduced for the MA in England, at the newly established Durham University (even though, as in the ancient English universities, this was to confer full membership), to be followed in 1840 by the similarly new University of London, which was only empowered by its charter to grant degrees by examination. However, by the middle of the century the MA as an examined second degree was again under threat, with Durham moving to awarding it automatically to those who gained honours in the BA in 1857, along the lines of the Oxbridge MA, and Edinburgh following the other Scottish universities in awarding the MA as its first degree, in place of the BA, from 1858. At the same time, new universities were being established around the then British Empire along the lines of London, including examinations for the MA: the University of Sydney in Australia and the Queen's University of Ireland in 1850, and the Universities of Bombay (now the University of Mumbai), Madras and Calcutta in India in 1857. In the US, the revival of master's degrees as an examined qualification began in 1856 at the University of North Carolina, followed by the University of Michigan in 1859, although the idea of a master's degree as an earned second degree was not well established until the 1870s, alongside the PhD as the terminal degree. Sometimes it was possible to earn an MA either by examination or by seniority in the same institution, e.g. in Michigan the \\"in course\\" MA was introduced in 1848 and was last awarded in 1882, while the \\"on examination\\" MA was introduced in 1859. Probably the most important master's degree introduced in the 19th century was the Master of Science (MS in the US, MSc in the UK). At the University of Michigan this was introduced in two forms in 1858: \\"in course\\", first awarded in 1859, and \\"on examination\\", first awarded in 1862. The \\"in course\\" MS was last awarded in 1876. In Britain, however, the degree took a while longer to arrive. When London introduced its Faculty of Sciences in 1858, the University was granted a new charter giving it the power \\"to confer the several Degrees of Bachelor, Master, and Doctor, in Arts, Laws, Science, Medicine, Music\\", but the degrees it awarded in science were the Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Science. The same two degrees, again omitting the master's, were awarded at Edinburgh, despite the MA being the standard undergraduate degree for Arts in Scotland. In 1862, a Royal Commission suggested that Durham should award master's degrees in theology and science (with the suggested abbreviations MT and MS, contrary to later British practice of using MTh or MTheol and MSc for these degrees), but its recommendations were not enacted. In 1877, Oxford introduced the Master of Natural Science, along with the Bachelor of Natural Science, to stand alongside the MA and BA degrees and be awarded to students who took their degrees in the honours school of natural sciences. In 1879 a statute to actually establish the faculty of Natural Sciences at Oxford was promulgated, but in 1880 a proposal to rename the degree as a Master of Science was rejected along with a proposal to grant Masters of Natural Sciences a Master of Arts degree, in order to make them full members of the University. This scheme would appear to have then been quietly dropped, with Oxford going on to award BAs and MAs in science. The Master of Science (MSc) degree was finally introduced in Britain in 1878 at Durham, followed by the new Victoria University in 1881. At the Victoria University both the MA and MSc followed the lead of Durham's MA in requiring a further examination for those with an ordinary bachelor's degree but not for those with honours. =Twentieth century= At the start of the twentieth century, there were, therefore, four different sorts of master's degree in the UK: the Scottish MA, granted as a first degree; the Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin), granted to all BA graduates a certain period after their first degree without further study; master's degrees that could be gained either by further study or by gaining an honours degree (which, at the time in the UK involved further study beyond the ordinary degree, as it still does in Scotland and some Commonwealth countries); and master's degrees that could only be obtained by further study (including all London master's degrees). In 1903, the London Daily News criticised the practice of Oxford and Cambridge, calling their MAs \\"the most stupendous of academic frauds\\" and \\"bogus degrees\\". Ensuing correspondence pointed out that \\"A Scotch M.A., at the most, is only the equivalent of an English B.A.\\" and called for common standards for degrees, while defenders of the ancient universities said that \\"the Cambridge M.A. does not pretend to be a reward of learning\\" and that \\"it is rather absurd to describe one of their degrees as a bogus one because other modern Universities grant the same degree for different reasons\\". In 1900, Dartmouth College introduced the Master of Commercial Science (MCS), first awarded in 1902. This was the first master's degree in business, the forerunner of the modern MBA. The idea quickly crossed the Atlantic, with Manchester establishing a Faculty of Commerce, awarding Bachelor and Master of Commerce degrees, in 1903. Over the first half of the century the automatic master's degrees for honours graduates vanished as honours degrees became the standard undergraduate qualification in the UK. In the 1960s, new Scottish universities (except for Dundee, which inherited the undergraduate MA from St Andrews) reintroduced the BA as their undergraduate degree in Arts, restoring the MA to its position as a postgraduate qualification. Oxford and Cambridge retained their MAs, but renamed many of their postgraduate bachelor's degrees in the higher faculties as master's degrees, e.g. the Cambridge LLB became the LLM in 1982, and the Oxford BLitt, BPhil (except in philosophy) and BSc became the MLitt, MPhil and MSc. In 1983, the Engineering Council issued a \\"'Statement on enhanced and extended undergraduate engineering degree courses\\", proposing the establishment of a four-year first degree (Master of Engineering). These were up and running by the mid 1980s and were followed in the early 1990s by the MPhys for physicists and since then integrated master's degrees in other sciences such as MChem, MMath, and MGeol, and in some institutions general or specific MSci (Master in Science) and MArts (Master in Arts) degrees. This development was noted by the Dearing Report into UK Higher Education in 1997, which called for the establishment of a national framework of qualifications and identified five different routes to master's degrees: * Four year (five in Scotland) first degrees such as the MEng * Conversion degrees, sometimes below the standard of undergraduate degrees in the same subject * The honours arts degree of the ancient universities of Scotland * Specialist postgraduate programmes, such as the MA and MSc * The Oxbridge MA, awarded without additional work This led to the establishment of the Quality Assurance Agency, which was charged with drawing up the framework. =Twenty-first century= In 2000 renewed pressure was put on Oxbridge MAs in the UK Parliament, with Labour MP Jackie Lawrence introducing an early day motion calling for them to be scrapped and telling the Times Higher Education it was a \\"discriminatory practice\\" and that it \\"devalues and undermines the efforts of students at other universities\\". The following month the Quality Assurance Agency announced the results of a survey of 150 major employers showing nearly two thirds mistakenly thought the Cambridge MA was a postgraduate qualification and just over half made the same error regarding the Edinburgh MA, with QAA chief executive John Randall calling the Oxbridge MA \\"misleading and anachronistic\\". The QAA released the first \\"framework for higher education qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland\\" in January 2001. This specified learning outcomes for M-level (master's) degrees and advised that the title \\"Master\\" should only be used for qualifications that met those learning outcomes in full. It addressed many of the Dearing Report's concerns, specifying that shorter courses at H-level (honours), e.g. conversion courses, should be styled Graduate Diploma or Graduate Certificate rather than as master's degrees, but confirmed that the extended undergraduate degrees were master's degrees, saying that \\"Some Masters degrees in science and engineering are awarded after extended undergraduate programmes that last, typically, a year longer than Honours degree programmes\\". It also addressed the Oxbridge MA issue, noting that \\"the MAs granted by the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are not academic qualifications\\". The first \\"framework for qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland\\", also published in January 2001, used the same qualifications descriptors, adding in credit values that specified that a stand-alone master should be 180 credits and a \\"Masters (following an integrated programme from undergraduate to Masters level study)\\" should be 600 credits with a minimum of 120 at M-level. It was specified that the title \\"Master\\" should only be used for qualifications that met the learning outcomes and credit definitions, although it was noted that \\"A small number of universities in Scotland have a long tradition of labelling certain first degrees as 'MA'. Reports of Agency reviews of such provision will relate to undergraduate benchmarks and will make it clear that the title reflects Scottish custom and practice, and that any positive judgement on standards should not be taken as implying that the outcomes of the programme were at postgraduate level.\\" The Bologna declaration in 1999 started the Bologna Process, leading to the creation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This established a three-cycle bachelor's‚Äîmaster's‚Äîdoctorate classification of degrees, leading to the adoption of master's degrees across the continent, often replacing older long-cycle qualifications such as the (arts), (sciences) and state registration (professional) awards in Germany. As the process continued, descriptors were introduced for all three levels in 2004, and ECTS credit guidelines were developed. This led to questions as to the status of the integrated master's degrees and one-year master's degrees in the UK. However, the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland have both been aligned with the overarching framework for the EHEA with these being accepted as masters-level qualifications. Titles Master's degrees are commonly titled using the form 'Master of ...', where either a faculty (typically Arts or Science) or a field (Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Business Administration, etc.) is specified. The two most common titles of master's degrees are the Master of Arts (MA/M.A./A.M) and Master of Science (MSc/M.Sc./M.S./S.M.) degrees, which normally consist of a mixture of research and taught material. The title of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) indicates (in the same manner as Doctor of Philosophy) an extended degree with a large research component. Other generically named master's programs include the Master of Studies (MSt)/Master of Advanced Study (MASt)/Master of Advanced Studies (M.A.S.), and Professional Master's (MProf). Integrated master's degrees and postgraduate master's degrees oriented towards professional practice are often more specifically named for their field of study (\\"tagged degrees\\"), including, for example, Master of Business Administration, Master of Divinity, Master of Engineering and Master of Physics. The form \\"Master in ...\\" is also sometimes used, particularly where a faculty title is used for an integrated master's in addition to its use in a traditional postgraduate master's, e.g. Master in Science (MSci) and Master in Arts (MArts). This form is also sometimes used with other integrated master's degrees and occasionally for postgraduate master's degrees (e.g. Master's in Accounting). Some universities use Latin degree names; because of the flexibility of syntax in Latin, the Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees may be known in these institutions as and or reversed from the English order to and . Examples of the reversed usage include Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and MIT, leading to the abbreviations A.M. and S.M. for these degrees. The forms \\"Master of Science\\" and \\"Master in Science\\" are indistinguishable in Latin. In the UK, full stops (periods) are not commonly used in degree abbreviations. In the US, The Gregg Reference Manual recommends placing periods in degrees (e.g. B.S., Ph.D.), while The Chicago Manual of Style recommends writing degrees without periods (e.g. BS, PhD). Master of Science is generally abbreviated M.S. or MS in countries following United States usage and MSc or M.Sc. in countries following British usage, where MS would refer to the degree of Master of Surgery. In Australia, some extended master's degrees use the title \\"doctor\\": Juris doctor and Doctors of Medical Practice, Physiotherapy, Dentistry, Optometry and Veterinary Practice. Despite their titles these are still master's degree and may not be referred to as doctoral degrees, nor may graduates use the title \\"doctor\\". =Types= * Postgraduate/graduate master's degrees (MA/M.A./A.M., MPhil/M.Phil., MSc/M.S./SM, MBA/M.B.A., LLM/LL.M., MAsc, etc.) are the traditional formal form of master's degree, where the student already holds an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree on entry. Courses normally last one year in the UK and two years in the US. * Integrated master's degrees (MChem, MEng, MMath, MPharm, MPhys, MPsych, MSci, etc.) are UK degrees that combine an undergraduate bachelor's degree course with an extra year at master's level (i.e. a total of four years in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and five years in Scotland). A 2011 survey of UK Higher Education Institutes found that 64% offered integrated master's course, mostly in STEM disciplines, with the most common degrees being MEng, MSci and MChem. 82% of respondents conferred only a master's degree for the course, while 9% conferred a bachelor's degree at the end of the bachelor's-level stage and a master's degree at the end of the course and a further 9% conferred both bachelor's and master's degrees at the end of the course. *Non-master's level master's degrees The ancient universities of the UK and Ireland have traditionally awarded MAs in a different manner to that usual today. The Scottish MA is a bachelor's-level qualification offered by the ancient universities of Scotland. The Oxbridge MA is not an academic qualification; it is granted without further examination to those who have gained a BA from Oxford or Cambridge Universities in England, and the MA of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland is granted to its graduates in a similar manner. The UK Quality Assurance Agency defines three categories of master's degrees: * Research master's degrees are primarily research based, although may contain taught elements, particularly on research methods. Examples are the MLitt (usually, but not always a research degree), the Master's by Research, and the MPhil. The Master's by Research (MbyRes, ResM), which is a research degree, is distinct from the Master of Research (MRes), which is a taught degree concentrating on research methods. * Specialised or advanced study master's degrees are primarily taught degrees, although commonly at least a third of the course is devoted to a research project assessed by dissertation. These may be stand-alone master's courses, leading to, e.g., MSc, MA or MRes degrees, or integrated master's degrees. * Professional or practice master's degrees (see also professional degree) are designed to prepare students for a particular professional career and are primarily taught, although they may include work placements and independent study projects. Some may require professional experience for entry. Examples include MBA, MDiv, LLM and MSW as well as some integrated master's degrees. The name of the degree normally includes the subject name. The United States Department of Education classifies master's degrees as research or professional. Research master's degrees in the US (e.g., M.A./A.M. or M.S.) require the completion of taught courses and examinations in a major and one or more minor subjects, as well as (normally) a research thesis. Professional master's degrees may be structured like research master's (e.g., M.E./M.Eng.) or may concentrate on a specific discipline (e.g., M.B.A.) and often substitute a project for the thesis. The Australian Qualifications Framework classifies master's degrees as research, coursework or extended. Research master's degrees typically take one to two years, and two thirds of their content consists of research, research training and independent study. Coursework master's degrees typically also last one to two years, and consist mainly of structured learning with some independent research and project work or practice-related learning. Extended master's degrees typically take three to four years and contain significant practice- related learning that must be developed in collaboration with relevant professional, statutory or regulatory bodies. In Ireland, master's degrees may be either Taught or Research. Taught master's degrees are normally one to two year courses, rated at 60 - 120 ECTS credits, while research master's degrees are normally two year courses, either rated at 120 ECTS credits or not credit rated. Structure There is a range of pathways to the degree with entry based on evidence of a capacity to undertake higher level studies in a proposed field. A dissertation may or may not be required depending on the program. In general, structure and duration of a program of study leading to a master's degree will differ by country and university. =Duration= Master's programs in the US and Canada are normally two years (full-time) in length. In some fields/programs, work on a doctorate begins immediately after the bachelor's degree, but a master's may be granted along the way as an intermediate qualification if the student petitions for it. Some universities offer evening options so that students can work during the day and earn a master's degree in the evenings. In the UK, postgraduate master's degrees typically take one to two years full-time or two to four years part-time. Master's degrees may be classified as either \\"research\\" or \\"taught\\", with taught degrees (those where research makes up less than half of the volume of work) being further subdivided into \\"specialist or advanced study\\" or \\"professional or practice\\". Taught degrees (of both forms) typically take a full calendar year (180 UK credits, compared to 120 for an academic year), while research degrees are not typically credit rated but may take up to two years to complete. An MPhil normally takes two calendar years (360 credits). An integrated master's degree (which is always a taught degree) combines a bachelor's degree course with an additional year of study (120 credits) at master's level for a four (England, Wales and Northern Ireland) or five (Scotland) academic year total period. In Australia, master's degrees vary from one year for a \\"research\\" or \\"coursework\\" master's following on from an Australian honours degree in a related field, with an extra six months if following on straight from an ordinary bachelor's degree and another extra six months if following on from a degree in a different field, to four years for an \\"extended\\" master's degree. At some Australian universities, the master's degree may take up to two years. In the Overarching Framework of Qualifications for the European Higher Education Area defined as part of the Bologna process, a \\"second cycle\\" (i.e. master's degree) programme is typically 90‚Äì120 ECTS credits, with a minimum requirement of at least 60 ECTS credits at second-cycle level. The definition of ECTS credits is that \\"60 ECTS credits are allocated to the learning outcomes and associated workload of a full-time academic year or its equivalent\\", thus European master's degrees should last for between one calendar year and two academic years, with at least one academic year of study at master's level. The Framework for Higher Education Qualification (FHEQ) in England Wales and Northern Ireland level 7 qualifications and the Framework for Qualification of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland (FQHEIS) level 11 qualifications (postgraduate and integrated master's degrees, except for MAs from the ancient universities of Scotland and Oxbridge MAs) have been certified as meeting this requirement. Irish master's degrees are 1‚Äì2 years (60‚Äì120 ECTS credits) for taught degrees and 2 years (not credit rated) for taught and research degrees. These have also been certified as compatible with the FQ-EHEA. =Admission= Admission to a master's degree normally requires successful completion of study at bachelor's degree level either (for postgraduate degrees) as a stand-alone degree or (for integrated degrees) as part of an integrated scheme of study. In countries where the bachelor's degree with honours is the standard undergraduate degree, this is often the normal entry qualification. In addition, students will normally have to write a personal statement and, in the arts and humanities, will often have to submit a portfolio of work. In the UK, students will normally need to have a 2:1. Students may also have to provide evidence of their ability to successfully pursue a postgraduate degree to be accepted into a taught master's course, and possibly higher for a research master's. Graduate schools in the US similarly require strong undergraduate performance, and may require students to take one or more standardised tests, such as the GRE, GMAT or LSAT. Comparable European degrees In some European countries, a magister is a first degree and may be considered equivalent to a modern (standardized) master's degree (e.g., the German, Austrian and Polish university Diplom/Magister, or the similar five- year Diploma awarded in several subjects in Greek, Spanish, Portuguese, and other universities and polytechnics). Under the Bologna Process, countries in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) are moving to a three-cycle (bachelor's - master's - doctorate) system of degrees. Two-thirds of EHEA countries have standardised on 120 ECTS credits for their second-cycle (master's) degrees, but 90 ECTS credits is the main form in Cyprus, Ireland and Scotland and 60-75 credits in Montenegro, Serbia and Spain. The combined length of the first and second cycle varies from \\"3 + 1\\" years (240 ECTS credits), through \\"3 + 2\\" or \\"4 + 1\\" years (300 ECTS credits), to \\"4 + 2\\" years (360 ECTS credits). As of 2015, 31 EHEA countries have integrated programmes that combine the first and second cycle and lead to a second-cycle qualification (e.g. the UK integrated master's degree), particularly in STEM subjects and subjects allied to medicine. These typically have a duration of 300 ‚Äì 360 ECTS credits (five to six years), with the integrated master's degrees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland being the shortest at 240 ECTS credits (four years). * In Denmark there are two forms of master's degree. The Master's Degree or candidatus is a FQ-EHEA second-cycle qualification worth 120 ECTS credits. These degrees are research-based and offered through universities (e.g. University of Copenhagen and Copenhagen Business School). The second form is the Master Degree (no possessive) within the adult further education system, which is worth 60 ECTS credits and is taught part-time. The candidatus degree is abbreviated cand. and upon completion of, for instance, an engineering master's degree, a person becomes cand.polyt. (polytechnical). Similar abbreviations, inspired by Latin, apply to a large number of fields, e.g.: sociology (cand.scient.soc), economics (cand.merc., cand.polit. or cand.oecon), law (cand.jur), humanities (cand.mag) etc. Use of a cand. title requires a master's degree. Holders of a cand. degree are also entitled to use M.Sc. or M.A. titles, depending on the field of study. In Finland and Sweden, the title of kandidaatti/kandidat (abbreviated kand.) equates to a bachelor's degree. * In France, the master's degree (dipl√¥me de master) takes two years and is worth 120 ECTS credits. The two years are often called the master 1 (M1) and master 2 (M2), following the Bologna Process. Depending on the goal of the student (a doctorate or a professional career) the master can also be called a \\"Master Recherche\\" (research master) or a \\"Master Professionnel\\" (professional master), each with different requirements. A French dipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur (postgraduate degree in engineering of grandes √©coles) is also the equivalent of a master's degree, provided the diploma is recognised by the Commission des titres d'ing√©nieur, as are qualifications recognised at Level 7 of the r√©pertoire national des certifications professionnelles (national register of professional certificates). * In Italy the master's degree is equivalent to the two-year Laurea magistrale, which can be earned after a Laurea (a three-year undergraduate degree, equivalent to a bachelor's degree). In particular fields, namely law, pharmacy and medicine, this distinction is not made. University courses are therefore single and last five to six years, after which the master's degree is awarded (in this case referred to as Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico). The old Laurea degree (Vecchio Ordinamento, Old Regulations), which was the only awarded in Italy before the Bologna process, is equivalent to the current Laurea Magistrale. * In the Netherlands the titles ingenieur (ir.), meester (mr.) and doctorandus (drs.) may be rendered, if obtained in the Netherlands from a university, after the application of the Bologna process, as: MSc instead of ir., LLM instead of mr. and MA or MSc instead of drs. This is because a single program that led to these degree was in effect before 2002, which comprised the same course load as the bachelor and master programs put together. Those who had already started the program could, upon completing it, bear the appropriate title (MSc, LLM or MA), but alternatively still use the old-style title (ir., mr. or drs.), corresponding to their field of study. Since these graduates do not have a separate bachelor's degree (which is ‚Äì in retrospect ‚Äì incorporated into the program), the master's degree is their first academic degree. Bearers of foreign master's degree can use the titles ir., mr. and drs. only after obtaining a permission to bear such titles from the Dienst Uitvoering Onderwijs. Those who received their mr., ir. or drs. title after the application of the Bologna process have the option of signing as A. Jansen, MA or A. Jansen, MSc, depending on the field in which the degree was obtained, since the ir., mr. and drs. titles are similar to a master's degree, and the shortcut MA or MSc. may officially be used in order to render such title as an international title. * In Switzerland, the old Licence or Diplom (4 to 5 years in duration) is considered equivalent to the master's degree. * In Slovenia and Croatia, during the pre-Bologna process education, all academic degrees were awarded after a minimum of four years of university studies and a successful defence of a written thesis and are considered equivalent to the master's degree. After the completion of that first cycle of the pre-Bologna higher education, the students obtained professional degrees with the titles of Professor (abbreviation \\"prof.\\") for educational studies, Engineer (abbreviation \\"ing.\\") for technical studies, or Licensed professional of their field of expertise (abbreviation \\"dipl.\\" with a reference to the profession) for other studies. The title of Magister Scientiae (abbreviation \\"mr. sc.\\") was awarded to students who completed a postgraduate university programme (and therefore qualified for a doctorate programme), while the title of Scientiae Doctor (abbreviation \\"dr. sc.\\") was awarded to students who completed a postgraduate doctoral programme. Slovenia is a full member of the Bologna Process since 1999 and Croatia since 2001. * In Baltic countries there is a two-year education program that offers a chance to gain a master's degree in interdisciplinary issues. The system offers an education in different areas, such as humanities, environmental and social issues, whilst paying specific consideration to the Baltic Sea area. It is a joint-degree program, which is part of a team effort with four universities. There is for example the University of Tartu in Estonia, Vytautas Magnus University in Lithuania and the University of Latvia. The educational programmes allow students to be mobile within the system, for example one semester may be taken in a confederate school without paying additional membership or tuition fees. Subsequently, after passing the qualifications provided, people may procure teaching qualifications and continue their scholastic research around doctoral studies, or carry on studying within their career in the private or public sector. Graduates of the program, within the Baltic Sea area are also given the chance to continue onwards with their studies within the postgraduate system if they have studied the social sciences or humanities field. * In Greece, the metaptychiako (ŒºŒµœÑŒ±œÄœÑœÖœáŒπŒ±Œ∫œå) which literally translates as post- degree (...programme or title), lasts normally from one to, more often, two years, and can be studied after a, at least, four-years undergraduate ptychio, which means degree. Also, the five-year diploma (Œ¥ŒØœÄŒªœâŒºŒ±) awarded in all Polytechnics (schools of engineering) and the Athens School of Fine Arts is considered equal to a graduate degree plus a master's degree. * In Russia master (–º–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä) degree can be obtained after a two-year master course (–º–∞–≥–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞) which is available after a four-year bachelor or a five-year specialist course. A graduate may choose a master course completely different from his/her previous one. During these two years master students attend specialized lectures in chosen profile, choose a faculty advisor and prepare their master thesis which is eventually defended before certifying commission consisting mostly of professors, leading by the professor from another university. * In the United Kingdom, first degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science are considered equivalent to master's degrees despite, for historical reasons, often having the titles of bachelor's degrees. * The old Spanish degrees of Licenciado (Licenciate), Arquitecto (Architect) and Ingeniero (Engineer) are also equivalent to master's degrees. They were integrated programmes of study that combined first and second cycles and led to a second cycle qualification. The Spanish government issued a royal decree in 2014 establishing the official equivalences between the Spanish pre-Bologna degrees and the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) levels. Most (if not all) Licenciado, Arquitecto and Ingeniero degrees were placed in level 7 (Master) of the EQF. These programmes have been phased out and replaced with the new Bologna programmes of M√°ster, to be completed after completion of a programme of Grado (Bachelor's). Brazil After acquiring a Bachelor's or Licenciate Degree, students are qualified to continue their academic career through Master's Degree (\\"mestrado\\", in Portuguese, a.k.a. stricto sensu post-graduation) or Specialization Degree (\\"especializa√ß√£o\\", in Portuguese, a.k.a. lato sensu post-graduation) programs. At the Master's program there are 2‚Äì3 years of graduate-level studies. Usually focused on academic research, the Master's Degree requires, on any specific knowledge area, the development of a thesis to be presented and defended before a board of professors after the period of research. Conversely, the Specialization Degree, also comprehends a 1‚Äì2 years studies, but does not require a new thesis to be proposed and defended, being usually attended by professionals looking for complementary training on a specific area of their knowledge. In addition, many Brazilian universities offer an MBA program. However, those are not the equivalent to a United States MBA degree, as it does not formally certify the student with a Master's degree (stricto sensu) but with a Specialization Degree (lato sensu) instead. A regular post-graduation course has to comply with a minimum of 360 class- hours, while a M.B.A. degree has to comply with a minimum of 400 class-hours. Master's degree (stricto sensu) does not require a set minimum of class-hours, but it's practically impossible to finish it in less than 18 months due to the workload and research required; an average time for the degree is 2.5 years. Specialization (lato sensu) and M.B.A. degrees can be also offered as distance education courses, while the master's degree (stricto-sensu) requires physical attendance. In Brazil, the degree often serves as additional qualification for those seeking to differentiate themselves in the job market, or for those who want to pursue a Ph.D. It corresponds to the European (Bologna Process) 2nd Cycle or the North American master's. Asia=Hong Kong= M.Arch., M.L.A., M.U.D., M.A., M.Sc., M.Soc.Sc., M.S.W., M.Eng., LL.M. * Hong Kong requires one or two years of full-time coursework to achieve a master's degree. For part-time study, two or three years of study are normally required to achieve a postgraduate degree. M.Phil. * As in the United Kingdom, M.Phil/MPhil/Master of Philosophy is the most advanced master's degree and usually includes both a taught portion and a research portion which requires candidates to complete an extensive original research for their thesis. Regardless of subject, students in all faculties (including sciences, arts, humanities and social sciences) may be awarded the Master of Philosophy. =Pakistan= In Pakistani education system, there are two different master's degree programmes: * 2 years master's programmes: these are mostly Master of Arts (M.A.) leading to M.Phil. * 4 years master's programmes: these are mostly Master of Science (M.S.) leading to Ph.D Both M.A. and M.S. are offered in all major subjects. =India= In the Indian system, a master's degree is a postgraduate degree following a Bachelor's degree and preceding a Doctorate, usually requiring two years to complete. The available degrees include but are not limited to the following: * Master of Arts (M.A.) *Master of Social Work (MSW) * Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) * Master of Computer Applications (M.C.A.) * Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) * Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) * Master of Science (M.Sc.) * Master of Technology (M.Tech.) * Master of Statistics (M.Stat.) * Master of Laws (LL.M.) * Master of Commerce (M.Com.) * Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) * Master of Veterinary Science (MVSc) =Indonesia= In the Indonesian higher education system, a master's degree () is a postgraduate degree following a Bachelor's degree and preceding a Doctorate, requiring maximum of four years to complete.https://lldikti3.ristekdikti.go.id/v5/2016/01/15/permenristedikti- nomor-44-tahun-2015-tentang-standar-nasional-pendidikan-tinggi/ Master's student is required to submit their thesis () for examination by two or three examiners.

Degrees awarded are the M.A., M.Sc., M.B.A. and LLM; the Technion awards a non-thesis M.Eng. There also exists \\"a direct track\\" doctorate degree, which lasts four to five years. Taking this route, students prepare a preliminary research paper during their first year, after which they must pass an exam before being allowed to proceed, at which point they are awarded a master's degree. =Nepal= In Nepal, after bachelor's degree about to at least three or four years with full-time study in college and university with an entrance test for those people who want to study further can study in master and further Ph.D. and doctorate degree. All doctoral and Ph.D. or third cycle degree are based on research and experience oriented and result based. Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), Master of Education (M.Ed.), Master of Arts (M.A.) and all law and medicine related courses are studied after completion of successful bachelor towards doctoral degree. M.B.B.S. is only a medical degree with six and half years of study resulting medical doctor and need to finish its study o 4 years of period joining after master degree with minimum education with 15 or 16 years of university bachelor's degree education. The most professional and internationalised program in Nepal are as follows: * Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) * Master of Computer Applications (M.C.A.) * Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) * Master of Science (M.Sc.) * Master of Science in Information Technology (M.Sc.I.T.) * Master of Business Studies (M.B.S.) * Master of Education (M.Ed) * Master of Arts (M.A.) * Master of Science in Agriculture (M.Sc.Ag.) * Master of Laws (LL.M.) * Master of Management (M.M.) =Taiwan= In Taiwan, bachelor's degrees are about four years (with honors) and there is an entrance examination required for people who want to study in master and Ph.D. degrees. The courses offered for master and PhD normally are research-based. Programs are entirely in English and tuition is less than would be paid in North America, with as little as US$5000 for an M.B.A. As an incentive to increase the number of foreign students, the government of Taiwan and universities have made extra efforts to provide a range of quality scholarships available. These are university-specific scholarships ranging from tuition waivers, up to NT$20,000 per month. The government offers the Taiwan Scholarship ranging from NT$20,000‚Äì30,000 per month for two years. (US$18,000‚Äì24,000 for a two-year program) See also * Associate's degree * Bachelor's degree * British degree abbreviations * Diploma mill * Doctorate * Educational specialist * Engineer's degree * Euromaster * European Joint Master degree in Economics * Graduate school * Licentiate * List of master's degrees * Magister (degree) * Master of Advanced Studies * Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin) * Master of Arts (Scotland) * Master of Engineering * Master of Laws * Master of Science * Master's degree in Europe * Master's degree in North America * Master's degree non- Euroamerican * Professional Science Master's degree * Terminal degree  Notes  References  Category:Academic degrees of the United States ","title":"Master's degree"},{"id":"170348","text":"Poetry analysis is the process of investigating a poem's form, content, structural semiotics and history in an informed way, with the aim of heightening one's own and others' understanding and appreciation of the work. The words poem and poetry derive from the Greek poiƒìma (to make) and poieo (to create). That is, a poem is a made thing: a creation; an artifact. One might think of a poem as, in the words of William Carlos Williams, a \\"machine made of words\\". Machines produce some effect, or do some work. They do whatever they are designed to do. The work done by this \\"machine made of words\\" is the effect it produces in the reader's mind. A reader analyzing a poem is akin to a mechanic taking apart a machine in order to figure out how it works. Like poetry itself, poetry analysis can take many forms, and be undertaken for many different reasons. A teacher might analyze a poem in order to gain a more conscious understanding of how the poem achieves its effects, in order to communicate this to his or her students. A writer learning the craft of poetry might use the tools of poetry analysis to expand and strengthen his or her own mastery. A reader might use the tools and techniques of poetry analysis in order to discern all that the work has to offer, and thereby gain a fuller, more rewarding appreciation of the poem. Overview=\\"The Destruction of Sennacherib\\", by Lord Byron= Similarly, one can derive pleasureLouise Bogan, 'The Pleasures of Formal Poetry', in Reginald Gibbons (ed.), The Poet‚Äôs Work: 29 Poets On The Origins And Practice Of Their Art (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1979) from two of the most fundamental tools in the poet's toolbox‚Äîmeter and rhyme‚Äîwithout necessarily knowing a lot of terminology, as in this, the first stanza of Byron's \\"The Destruction of Sennacherib\\": :The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold, :And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold; :And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea, :When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee. Byron's use of meter and rhyme is especially evident and rewarding when one reads the lines out loud. The lines have a powerful, rolling, and very evident rhythm, and they rhyme in a way that is impossible to ignore. In other words, the physicality of the language‚Äîhow it sounds and feels‚Äîaccounts for a large measure of the poem's effect. The poem does not have a deep, hidden, symbolic meaning. Rather, it is simply pleasurable to read, say, and hear. Critical terminology becomes useful when one attempts to account for why the language is pleasurable, and how Byron achieved this effect. The lines are not simply rhythmic: the rhythm is regular within a line, and is the same for each line. A poem having a regular rhythm (not all poems do) is said to follow a certain meter. In \\"The Destruction of Sennacherib\\", each line has the basic pattern of two unstressed syllables followed by a third stressed syllable, with this basic pattern being repeated four times in a line. Those basic patterns are called feet, and this particular pattern (weak weak STRONG) is called an anapest. A line with four feet is said to be in tetrameter (tetra-, from the Greek for four). This poem has a pleasurable and appropriate rhythm, and that rhythm has a name: this poem is written in anapestic tetrameter. (This process of analyzing a poem's rhythms is called scansion.) The poem also rhymes (not all poems do), and the rhymes follow a pattern (they do not have to). In this case, the rhymes come right next to each other, which emphasizes them, and therefore emphasizes the sound, the physical nature, of the language. The effect of the poem's language derives in part from Byron's choice of an appropriate pattern of rhyme (or rhyme scheme): these adjacent, rhyming lines are called couplets. The sound, the physical nature, of the language is also emphasized by alliteration, as in the repetition of s sounds in the third line: \\"And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea\\". Tools=Poetic forms= Poems can have many forms. Some forms are strictly defined, with required line counts and rhyming patterns, such as the sonnet or limerick. Such poems exhibit closed form. Others (which exhibit open form) have less structure or, indeed, almost no apparent structure at all. This appearance, though, is deceptive: successful open form poems are informed throughout by organic structure which may resist formal description but is nonetheless a crucial element of the poem's effect on the reading mind. Closed forms A poet writing in closed form follows a specific pattern, a specific design. Some designs have proven so durable and so suited to the English language that they survive for centuries and are renewed with each generation of poets (sonnets, sestinas, limericks, and so forth), while others come into being for the expression of one poem and are then set aside (Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" is a good example). Of all closed forms in English prosody, none has demonstrated greater durability and range of expression than blank verse, which is verse that follows a regular meter but does not rhyme. In English, iambic pentameter is by far the most frequently employed meter. Among the many exemplary works of blank verse in English are Milton's Paradise Lost and most of the verse passages from Shakespeare's plays, such as this portion of a famous soliloquy from Hamlet: :To be, or not to be‚Äîthat is the question. :Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer :The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, :Or to take arms against a sea of troubles :And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep ‚Äî :No more, and by a sleep to say we end :The heartache and the thousand natural shocks :That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation :Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep, :To sleep‚Äîperchance to dream. Aye, there's the rub. Note that Shakespeare does not rigidly follow a pattern of five iambs per line. Rather, most lines have five strong syllables, and most are preceded by a weak syllable. The meter provides a rhythm that informs the line: it is not an invariable formula. Rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines form the heroic couplet. Two masters of the form are Alexander Pope and John Dryden. The form has proven especially suited to conveying wit and sardonic humor, as in the opening of Pope's An Essay on Criticism. :‚ÄôTis hard to say, if greater want of skill :Appear in writing or in judging ill; :But, of the two, less dang‚Äôrous is th‚Äô offence, :To tire our patience, than mislead our sense. :Some few in that, but numbers err in this, :Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss; :A fool might once himself alone expose, :Now one in verse makes many more in prose. Fourteen lines of iambic pentameter arranged in a more elaborate rhyme scheme form a sonnet. There are two major variants. The form originated in Italy, and the word derives from \\"sonetto\\", which is Italian for \\"little song\\". The Italian sonnet or Petrarchan sonnet follows a rhyme scheme of ABBA ABBA CDE CDE, ABBA ABBA CD CD CD, ABBA ABBA CCE DDE, or ABBA ABBA CDD CEE. In each of these, a group of eight lines (the octave) is followed by a group of six (the sextet). Typically, the octave introduces a situation, idea, or problem to which the sestet provides a response or resolution. For example, consider Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's \\"The Sound of the Sea\\": :The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep, :And round the pebbly beaches far and wide :I heard the first wave of the rising tide :Rush onward with uninterrupted sweep; :A voice out of the silence of the deep, :A sound mysteriously multiplied :As of a cataract from the mountain's side, :Or roar of winds upon a wooded steep. :So comes to us at times, from the unknown :And inaccessible solitudes of being, :The rushing of the sea-tides of the soul; :And inspirations, that we deem our own, :Are some divine foreshadowing and foreseeing :Of things beyond our reason or control. The octave presents the speaker's experience of the sound of the sea, coming to him from some distance. In the sestet, this experience mutates into a meditation on the nature of inspiration and man's connection to creation and his experience of the numinous. English has (proportionally) far fewer rhyming words than Italian. Recognizing this, Shakespeare adapted the sonnet form to English by creating an alternate rhyme scheme: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. The poet using this, the English sonnet or Shakespearean sonnet form, may use the fourteen lines as single unit of thought (as in \\"The Silken Tent\\" above), or treat the groups of four rhyming lines (the quatrains) as organizational units, as in Shakespeare's Sonnet 73: :That time of year thou mayst in me behold :When yellow leaves, or none, or few do hang :Upon those boughs which shake against the cold :Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang. :In me thou seest the twilight of such day :As after sunset fadeth in the west, :Which by and by black night doth steal away, :Death's second self, which seals up all in rest. :In me thou seest the glowing of such fire :That on the ashes of his youth doth lie, :As the deathbed whereon it must expire, :Consumed with that which it was nourished by. :This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong, :To love that well which thou must leave ere long. In lines 1‚Äì4, the speaker compares his time of life to autumn. In lines 5‚Äì8, the comparison is to twilight; in lines 9‚Äì12, the comparison is to the last moments of a dying fire. Each quatrain presents a shorter unit of time, creating a sense of time accelerating toward an inevitable end, the death implied in the final couplet. At the \\"high end\\" of closed forms are the sestina and villanelle. At the \\"low end\\" are forms such as the limerick, which follows a metrical pattern of two lines of anapestic trimeter (three anapests per line), followed by two lines of anapestic dimeter (two anapests per line), followed by one line of anapestic trimeter. (The beginning of the metrical foot does not have to coincide with the beginning of the line.) Any poem following this metrical pattern would generally be considered a limerick, however most also follow an AABBA rhyme scheme. Most limericks are humorous, and many are ribald, or outright obscene (possible rhymes that could follow an opening like \\"There once was a man from Nantucket\\" are left as an exercise for the reader). Nonetheless, the form is capable of sophisticated and playful expression: :Titian was mixing rose madder. :His model posed nude on a ladder. ::Her position to Titian ::Suggested coition :So he nipped up the ladder and had her.  Open forms  In contrast, a poet using free verse (sometimes called \\"open form\\") seeks to find fresh and uniquely appropriate forms for each poem, letting the structure grow out of the poem's subject matter or inspiration. A common perception is that open form is easier and less rigorous than closed form (Frost likened it to \\"playing tennis with the net down\\"Address at Milton Academy, Massachusetts (17 May 1935) , but such is not necessarily the case (skeptics should try playing tennis without a net): success with the open form requires great sensitivity to language and a particular type of adaptable understanding. In the best open form poems, the poet achieves something that is inaccessible through closed form. As X. J. Kennedy has said, \\"Should the poet succeed, then the discovered arrangement will seem exactly right for what the poem is saying\\" (582). The metre of ‚Äòclassical‚Äô poetry is replaced in open verse by cadence in rhythm, line indentation, with pauses implied by the syntax, thus the limiting factor of one human breath was naturally incorporated in the poetry, essential to an oral art form, composed to be read aloud.Sounds Aloud http://soundsaloud.blogspot.co.uk Walt Whitman was an important innovator of open form, and he demonstrates its merits in \\"A Noiseless Patient Spider\\". :A noiseless patient spider, :I marked where on a little promontory it stood isolated, :Marked how to explore the vacant vast surrounding, :It launched forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself, :Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them. :And you O my soul where you stand, :Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space, :Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them, :Till the bridge you will need to be formed, till the ductile anchor hold, :Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul. The long, rolling lines‚Äîunified, held together like strong cords, by alliteration and assonance‚Äîpartake of the same nature as the spider's filaments and the soul's threads. Two balanced stanzas, one describing a spider, the other the speaker's soul, perfectly frame the implicit comparison, with neither being privileged over the other. Just as the spider and the soul quest outward for significance, the two stanzas throw links to each other with subtly paired words: isolated/detached, launched/fling, tirelessly/ceaselessly, surrounding/surrounded. In this poem, Whitman uses synonyms and antonyms to give structural integrity to a poem comprising two yoked stanzas, much like (but not exactly like) the way poets working within closed forms use meter and rhyme to give structural integrity to their poems. The poem has form, but the form was not imposed by previous conventions. It has open form. =Imagery and symbolism= Most poetry can be read on several levels. The surface is not necessarily the essence of the poem although in some cases (notably, the works of William McGonagall) there is little beyond the immediate. Allegory, connotation and metaphor are some of the subtler ways in which a poet communicates with the reader. Before getting seduced into explorations of subtle nuance, however, the reader should establish the theme of the poem. What is the 'story' that is being told? Not the literal story but the heart of the poem. For example: \\"Another\\" tells of a buried child; \\"The Destruction of Sennacherib\\" tells of the annihilation of an Assyrian army by divine intervention; \\"The Silken Tent\\" compares a woman to a tent. Part of this involves recognising the voice of the poem (who is speaking), and the rest of Kipling's \\"six honest serving men\\": the events in the poem; when these occur; where is the 'speaker' and where do the events occur; why does the speaker speak? William Harmon has suggested that starting an analysis with: \\"This poem dramatizes the conflict between ...\\" is a key technique. George Herbert in his poem Jordan (I)Herbert pp. 68‚Äì69. asks if poetry must be about the imaginary. The poem opens: :Who sayes that fictions onely and false hair :Become a verse? Is there in truth no beautie? :Is all good structure in a winding stair? :May no lines passe, except they do their dutie :Not to a true, but painted chair? He was railing against the prevalent enthusiasm for pastoral poetry above all other forms (as becomes apparent in subsequent verses). Curiously, this verse uses metaphors to challenge the use of indirect approaches to their subject. False hair and a painted chair are decorations of the mundane. The winding stair is obstructive concealment of meaning. Herbert is criticising the overuse of allegory, symbolism or elaborate language. For most poets‚Äîeven the plain-speaking Herbert‚Äîmetaphor is the fundamental means of communicating complexity succinctly. Some metaphors become so widely used that they are widely recognised symbols and these can be identified by using a specialist dictionary. Allegorical verse uses an extended metaphor to provide the framework for the whole work. It was particularly prevalent in seventeenth century English but a more recent example is Charles Williams' The Masque of the Manuscript, in which the process of publishing is a metaphor for the search for truth.Ingraham Allegories are usually readily apparent because of the heavy use of metaphor within them. The symbolism used in a poem may not always be as overt as metaphor. Often the poet communicates emotionally by selecting words with particular connotations. For example, the word \\"sheen\\" in The Destruction of Sennacherib has stronger connotations of polishing, of human industry, than does the similar \\"shine\\". The Assyrians did not simply choose shiny metal; they worked to make it so. The word hints at a military machine. Other tropes that may be used to increase the level of allusion include irony, litotes, simile, and metonymy (particularly synecdoche). =Meter and rhythm= English language poetic meter depends on stress, rather than the number of syllables. It thus stands in contrast to poetry in other languages, such as French, where syllabic stress is not present or recognized and syllable count is paramount. This often makes scansion (the analysis of metrical patterns) seem unduly arcane and arbitrary to students of the craft. In the final analysis, the terms of scansion are blunt instruments, clumsy ways of describing the infinitely nuanced rhythms of language. Nonetheless, they provide a tool for discerning and describing the underlying structure of poems (especially those employing closed form). The terms fall into two groups: the names of the different feet, and the names of the varying line lengths. The most common feet in poetry written in English are the iamb (weak STRONG), the anapest (weak weak STRONG), the trochee (STRONG weak), and the dactyl (STRONG weak weak). The iamb and anapest are known as rising meters (they move \\"up\\" from weak to strong syllables); the trochee and dactyl are falling meters (they move \\"down\\" from strong to weak). Less common, but frequently important for the variety and energy they bring to a line, are the monosyllabic foot (weak) and the spondee (STRONG STRONG). The terms for line length follow a regular pattern: a Greek prefix denoting the number of feet and the root \\"meter\\" (for \\"measure\\"): monometer, dimeter, trimeter, tetrameter, pentameter, hexameter, heptameter, and octameter (lines having more than eight feet are possible but quite rare). Another useful term is caesura, for a natural pause within a line. Meter and line length are not formulas for successful lines of poetry. They are rough forms of notation for the many satisfying and variable rhythms of language. Slavish adherence to meter produces doggerel. Skillful poets structure their poems around a meter and line length, and then depart from it and play against it as needed in order to create effect, as Robert Browning does in the first line of \\"My Last Duchess\\": :That's my last Duchess painted on the wall. The opening spondees, which throw the iambic line out of pattern, gives the Duke's words a certain virulent energy: he's spitting the words out. Gerard Manley Hopkins took this idea of poetric energy through departure from meter to its extreme, with his theory and practice of sprung rhythm, an approach to poetry in which the language constantly frustrates the reading mind's expectation of a regular meter. =Sound, tone, diction, and connotation= Analyzing diction and connotation‚Äîthe meanings of words as well as the feelings and associations they carry‚Äîis a good place to start for any poem. The use of specific words in the poem serve to create a tone‚Äîan attitude taken towards the subject. For example, consider the words \\"slither\\" and \\"sneak.\\" When used in a poem, the words conjure up images of a snake. The sibilant s sound reinforces the image. The connotations of the words suggest something surreptitious and undercover. From the tone, one can infer that the author is suspicious or fearful of the subject. A detached tone, or an opposite tone than the reader would expect, are sometimes purposely employed to elicit more of a response. In the opening lines of \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\", T. S. Eliot quickly sets a certain tone, and then creates effect by juxtaposing it with a very different tone: :Let us go then, you and I, :When the evening is spread out against the sky :Like a patient etherized upon a table =Visual and concrete poetry= Poets such as E. E. Cummings experiment with punctuation and the words' layout on a page. In doing so, they venture into a realm of poetry that really cannot be read aloud: it can only be experienced through the eye. :l(a :le :af :fa :ll :s) :one :l :iness Cummings has fractured language into its most atomic elements. To analyze the poem, the reader must first reassemble these into meaningful units: a brief, evocative image‚Äî\\"a leaf falls\\"‚Äîappearing, like an unbidden thought, in the middle of a word, \\"loneliness\\". A single falling leaf is by itself a fine image for the feeling of loneliness, but in order to fully experience the poem, the reader must then put the elements of language back into the visual form in which Cummings arranged them: a vertical line (like a leaf falling to the ground), followed by a horizontal series of letters (like a leaf laying flat on the ground). The vertical line is dominated by the word \\"one\\" (an absolutely appropriate expression of loneliness) and by the letter \\"l\\" (which, on the page, looks like the numeral 1... it looks like \\"one\\"). Numerous other poets, including George Herbert, Lewis Carroll, William Blake, Wyndham Lewis, and John Hollander have used the layout of words, letters, and images on the page to create effect in their poems. An analytic reader of poetry must attend to the eye as well as the ear and the mind. Approaches=Schools of poetry= There are many different 'schools' of poetry: oral, classical, romantic, modernist, etc. and they each vary in their use of the elements described above. Schools of poetry may be self-identified by the poets that form them (such as Imagism), or defined by critics who see unifying characteristics of a body of work by more than one poet (for example The Movement). To be a 'school' a group of poets must share a common style or a common ethos. A commonality of form is not in itself sufficient to define a school; for example, Edward Lear, George du Maurier and Ogden Nash do not form a school simply because they all wrote limericks. =Schools of criticism= Poetry analysis is almost as old as poetry itself, with distinguished practitioners going back to figures such as Plato. At various times and places, groups of like-minded readers and scholars have developed, shared, and promoted specific approaches to poetry analysis. The New Criticism dominated English and American literary criticism from the 1920s to the early 1960s. The New Critical approach insists on the value of close reading and rejects extra- textual sources. The New Critics also rejected the idea that the work of a critic or analyst is to determine an author's intended meaning (a view formalized by W.K. Wimsatt and Monroe Beardsley as the intentional fallacy). The New Critics prized ambiguity, and tended to favor works that lend themselves to multiple interpretations. Reader-response criticism developed in Germany and the United States as a reaction to New Criticism. It emphasises the reader's role in the development of meaning. Reception theory is a development of reader-response criticism that considers the public response to a literary work and suggests that this can inform analysis of cultural ideology at the time of the response. =Reading poetry aloud= All poetry was originally oral, it was sung or chanted; poetic form as we know it is an abstraction therefrom when writing replaced memory as a way of preserving poetic utterances, but the ghost of oral poetry never vanishes.Hollander, John Rymes Reason ‚Äì A Gude to English Verse, Yale University Press, New Haven 1981 Poems may be read silently to oneself, or may be read aloud solo or to other people. Although reading aloud to oneself raises eyebrows in many circles, few people find it surprising in the case of poetry. In fact, many poems reveal themselves fully only when they are read aloud.

The typically bald, rocky, or sandy surfaces in desert climates hold little moisture and evaporate the little rainfall they receive. Covering 14.2% of earth's land area, hot deserts are the most common type of climate on earth after polar climate. Although no part of Earth is known for certain to be absolutely rainless, in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile, the average annual rainfall over a period of 17 years was only . Some locations in the Sahara Desert such as Kufra, Libya record only of rainfall annually. The official weather station in Death Valley, United States reports annually, but in a 40-month period between 1931 and 1934 a total of of rainfall was measured. There are two variations of a desert climate: a hot desert climate (BWh), and a cold desert climate (BWk). To delineate \\"hot desert climates\\" from \\"cold desert climates\\", there are three widely used isotherms: most commonly a mean annual temperature of , or sometimes a mean temperature of in the coldest month, so that a location with a BW type climate with the appropriate temperature above whichever isotherm is being used is classified as \\"hot arid\\" (BWh), and a location with the appropriate temperature below the given isotherm is classified as \\"cold arid\\" (BWk). Most desert and arid climates receive between of rainfall annually. In the K√∂ppen classification system, a climate will be classed as arid if its mean annual precipitation in millimeters is less than ten times its defined precipitation threshold, and it will be classed as a desert if its mean annual precipitation is less than five times this threshold. The precipitation threshold is twice its mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius, plus a constant to represent the distribution of its rainfall throughout the year. This constant is 0 for regions that receive 70% or more of their rainfall during the six winter (colder) months, 28 for regions that receive such a share of rainfall during the six summer months, and 14 for those in-between. Hot desert climates Hot desert climates (BWh) are typically found under the subtropical ridge in the lower middle latitudes, often between 20¬∞ and 33¬∞ north and south latitude. In these locations, stable descending air and high pressure aloft create hot, arid, conditions with intense sunshine. Hot desert climates are generally hot, sunny and dry year- round. They are found across vast areas of North Africa, the Middle East, northwestern parts of the Indian Subcontinent, interior Australia, and smaller areas of the Southwestern United States, and Chile. This makes hot deserts present in every continent except Europe and Antarctica. At the time of high sun (summer), scorching, desiccating heat prevails. Hot-month average temperatures are normally between , and midday readings of are common. The world absolute heat records, over , are generally in the hot deserts, where the heat potential is the highest on the planet. This includes the record of in Death Valley, which is currently considered the highest temperature recorded on Earth. Some desert locations consistently experience very high temperatures all year long, even during wintertime. These locations feature some of the highest annual average temperatures recorded on Earth, exceeding . This last feature is seen in sections of Africa and Arabia. During colder periods of the year, night-time temperatures can drop to freezing or below due to the exceptional radiation loss under the clear skies. However, very rarely do temperatures drop far below freezing. Regions with hot desert climates Hot desert climates can be found in the deserts of North Africa such as the wide Sahara Desert, the Libyan Desert or the Nubian Desert; deserts of the Horn of Africa such as the Danakil Desert or the Grand Bara Desert; deserts of Southern Africa such as the Namib Desert or the Kalahari Desert; deserts of the Middle East such as the Arabian Desert, the Syrian Desert or the Lut Desert; deserts of South Asia such as Dasht-e Kavir or the Thar Desert of India and Pakistan; deserts of the United States and Mexico such as the Mojave Desert, the Sonoran Desert or the Chihuahuan Desert; deserts of Australia such as the Simpson Desert or the Great Victoria Desert and many other regions. Hot deserts are lands of extremes: most of them are among the hottest, the driest and the sunniest places on Earth because of nearly constant high pressure; the nearly permanent removal of low pressure systems, dynamic fronts and atmospheric disturbances; sinking air motion; dry atmosphere near the surface and aloft; the exacerbated exposure to the sun where solar angles are always high. Cold desert climates Regions with cold desert climates Cold desert climates (BWk) usually feature hot (or warm in a few instances), dry summers, though summers are not typically as hot as hot desert climates. Unlike hot desert climates, cold desert climates tend to feature cold, dry winters. Snow tends to be rare in regions with this climate. The Gobi Desert in Mongolia is a classic example for cold deserts. Though hot in the summer, it shares the very cold winters of the rest of Central Asia. Cold desert climates are typically found at higher altitudes than hot desert climates and are usually drier than hot desert climates. Cold desert climates are typically located in temperate zones, usually in the rain shadow of high mountains, which restrict precipitation from the westerly winds. An example of this is the Patagonian Desert in Argentina bounded by the Andes to its west. In the case of Central Asia, mountains restrict precipitation from the monsoon. The Kyzyl Kum, Taklamakan and Katpana Desert deserts of Central Asia and the drier portions of the Great Basin Desert of the western United States are other major examples of BWk climates. The Ladakh region, and the city of Leh in the Great Himalayas in India, also has a cold desert climate. The Hautes Plaines is another major example of cold desert climates, located in the northeastern section of Morocco and in Algeria. This is also found in Europe, primarily in Bardenas Reales near Tudela, Navarre, Spain and high altitude parts of the Tabernas Desert in Almer√≠a, Spain. Arctic and Antarctic regions also receive very little precipitation during the year, owing to the exceptionally cold dry air; however, both of them are generally classified as having polar climates because they have average summer temperatures below .

The errors do not need to be normal, nor do they need to be independent and identically distributed (only uncorrelated with mean zero and homoscedastic with finite variance). The requirement that the estimator be unbiased cannot be dropped, since biased estimators exist with lower variance. See, for example, the James‚ÄìStein estimator (which also drops linearity), ridge regression, or simply any degenerate estimator. The theorem was named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov, although Gauss' work significantly predates Markov's. But while Gauss derived the result under the assumption of independence and normality, Markov reduced the assumptions to the form stated above. A further generalization to non-spherical errors was given by Alexander Aitken. Statement Suppose we have in matrix notation, : \\\\underline{y} = X \\\\underline{\\\\beta} + \\\\underline{\\\\varepsilon},\\\\quad (\\\\underline{y},\\\\underline{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\underline{\\\\beta} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^K \\\\text{ and } X\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^{n\\\\times K}) expanding to, : y_i=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{K}\\\\beta_j X_{ij}+\\\\varepsilon_i \\\\quad \\\\forall i=1,2,\\\\ldots,n where \\\\beta_j are non-random but unobservable parameters, X_{ij} are non- random and observable (called the \\"explanatory variables\\"), \\\\varepsilon_i are random, and so y_i are random. The random variables \\\\varepsilon_i are called the \\"disturbance\\", \\"noise\\" or simply \\"error\\" (will be contrasted with \\"residual\\" later in the article; see errors and residuals in statistics). Note that to include a constant in the model above, one can choose to introduce the constant as a variable \\\\beta_{K+1} with a newly introduced last column of X being unity i.e., X_{i(K+1)} = 1 for all i . Note that though y_i, as sample responses, are observable, the following statements and arguments including assumptions, proofs and the others assume under the only condition of knowing X_{ij},but not y_i. The Gauss‚ÄìMarkov assumptions concern the set of error random variables, \\\\varepsilon_i: *They have mean zero: \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\varepsilon_i]=0. *They are homoscedastic, that is all have the same finite variance: \\\\operatorname{Var}(\\\\varepsilon_i)= \\\\sigma^2 < \\\\infty for all i and *Distinct error terms are uncorrelated: \\\\text{Cov}(\\\\varepsilon_i,\\\\varepsilon_j) = 0, \\\\forall i eq j. A linear estimator of \\\\beta_j is a linear combination :\\\\widehat\\\\beta_j = c_{1j}y_1+\\\\cdots+c_{nj}y_n in which the coefficients c_{ij} are not allowed to depend on the underlying coefficients \\\\beta_j, since those are not observable, but are allowed to depend on the values X_{ij} , since these data are observable. (The dependence of the coefficients on each X_{ij} is typically nonlinear; the estimator is linear in each y_i and hence in each random \\\\varepsilon, which is why this is \\"linear\\" regression.) The estimator is said to be unbiased if and only if :\\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left [\\\\widehat\\\\beta_j \\\\right ]=\\\\beta_j regardless of the values of X_{ij} . Now, let \\\\sum olimits_{j=1}^K\\\\lambda_j\\\\beta_j be some linear combination of the coefficients. Then the mean squared error of the corresponding estimation is :\\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left [\\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=1}^K\\\\lambda_j \\\\left (\\\\widehat\\\\beta_j-\\\\beta_j \\\\right )\\\\right)^2\\\\right ], in other words it is the expectation of the square of the weighted sum (across parameters) of the differences between the estimators and the corresponding parameters to be estimated. (Since we are considering the case in which all the parameter estimates are unbiased, this mean squared error is the same as the variance of the linear combination.) The best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) of the vector \\\\beta of parameters \\\\beta_j is one with the smallest mean squared error for every vector \\\\lambda of linear combination parameters. This is equivalent to the condition that :\\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\widetilde\\\\beta\\\\right)- \\\\operatorname{Var} \\\\left( \\\\widehat \\\\beta \\\\right) is a positive semi-definite matrix for every other linear unbiased estimator \\\\widetilde\\\\beta. The ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) is the function :\\\\widehat\\\\beta=(X'X)^{-1}X'y of y and X (where X' denotes the transpose of X ) that minimizes the sum of squares of residuals (misprediction amounts): :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(y_i-\\\\widehat{y}_i\\\\right)^2=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(y_i-\\\\sum_{j=1}^K \\\\widehat\\\\beta_j X_{ij}\\\\right)^2. The theorem now states that the OLS estimator is a BLUE. The main idea of the proof is that the least-squares estimator is uncorrelated with every linear unbiased estimator of zero, i.e., with every linear combination a_1y_1+\\\\cdots+a_ny_n whose coefficients do not depend upon the unobservable \\\\beta but whose expected value is always zero. = Remark = Proof that the OLS indeed MINIMIZES the sum of squares of residuals may proceed as follows with a calculation of the Hessian matrix and showing that it is positive definite. The MSE function we want to minimize is f(\\\\beta_0,\\\\beta_1,\\\\dots,\\\\beta_p) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\\\beta_0-\\\\beta_1x_{i1}-\\\\dots-\\\\beta_px_{ip})^2 for a multiple regression model with p variables.

Moreover, \\\\overrightarrow{k}^T\\\\overrightarrow{k} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{p+1}k_i^2>0\\\\implies \\\\lambda >0 Finally, as eigenvector \\\\overrightarrow{k} was arbitrary, it means all eigenvalues of \\\\mathcal{H} are positive, therefore \\\\mathcal{H} is positive definite. Thus, \\\\overrightarrow{\\\\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY is indeed a local minimum. Proof Let \\\\tilde\\\\beta = Cy be another linear estimator of \\\\beta with C = (X'X)^{-1}X' + D where D is a K \\\\times n non-zero matrix. As we're restricting to unbiased estimators, minimum mean squared error implies minimum variance. The goal is therefore to show that such an estimator has a variance no smaller than that of \\\\widehat\\\\beta, the OLS estimator. We calculate: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\tilde\\\\beta \\\\right] &= \\\\operatorname{E}[Cy] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left [\\\\left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \\\\right )(X\\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon) \\\\right ]\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \\\\right )X\\\\beta + \\\\left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \\\\right ) \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\varepsilon] \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \\\\right )X\\\\beta && \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\varepsilon] =0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (X'X)^{-1}X'X\\\\beta + DX\\\\beta \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= (I_K + DX)\\\\beta. \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} Therefore, since \\\\beta is unobservable, \\\\tilde\\\\beta is unbiased if and only if DX = 0 . Then: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\tilde\\\\beta\\\\right) &= \\\\operatorname{Var}(Cy) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= C \\\\text{ Var}(y)C' \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sigma^2 CC' \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sigma^2 \\\\left ((X'X)^{-1}X' + D \\\\right ) \\\\left (X(X'X)^{-1} + D' \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sigma^2 \\\\left ((X'X)^{-1}X'X(X'X)^{-1} + (X'X)^{-1}X'D' + DX(X'X)^{-1} + DD' \\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1} + \\\\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1} (DX)' + \\\\sigma^2 DX (X'X)^{-1} + \\\\sigma^2DD' \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}+ \\\\sigma^2DD' && DX =0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) + \\\\sigma^2DD' && \\\\sigma^2(X'X)^{-1} = \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) \\\\end{align} Since DD' is a positive semidefinite matrix, \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left( \\\\tilde \\\\beta \\\\right) exceeds \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) by a positive semidefinite matrix. Remarks on the proof As it has been stated before, the condition of \\\\operatorname{Var} \\\\left( \\\\tilde \\\\beta \\\\right)- \\\\operatorname{Var} \\\\left(\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) is equivalent to the property that the best linear unbiased estimator of \\\\ell^t\\\\beta is \\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta (best in the sense that it has minimum variance). To see this, let \\\\ell^t\\\\tilde\\\\beta another linear unbiased estimator of \\\\ell^t\\\\beta . : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\ell^t\\\\tilde\\\\beta\\\\right) &= \\\\ell^t \\\\operatorname{Var} \\\\left(\\\\tilde\\\\beta\\\\right) \\\\ell \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\sigma^2 \\\\ell^t (X'X)^{-1}\\\\ell+\\\\ell^tDD^t\\\\ell \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right)+(D^t\\\\ell)^t(D^t\\\\ell) && \\\\sigma^2 \\\\ell^t (X'X)^{-1}\\\\ell = \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) +\\\\D^t\\\\ell\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\geqslant \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta\\\\right) \\\\end{align} Moreover, equality holds if and only if D^t\\\\ell=0 . We calculate : \\\\begin{align} \\\\ell^t\\\\tilde\\\\beta &= \\\\ell^t \\\\left (((X'X)^{-1}X' + D) Y \\\\right ) && \\\\text{ from above}\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\ell^t(X'X)^{-1}X'Y + \\\\ell^tDY \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta +(D^t\\\\ell)^t Y \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta && D^t\\\\ell = 0 \\\\end{align} This proves that the equality holds if and only if \\\\ell^t\\\\tilde\\\\beta=\\\\ell^t\\\\widehat\\\\beta which gives the uniqueness of the OLS estimator as a BLUE. Generalized least squares estimator The generalized least squares (GLS), developed by Aitken, extends the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem to the case where the error vector has a non-scalar covariance matrix. The Aitken estimator is also a BLUE. Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem as stated in econometrics In most treatments of OLS, the regressors (parameters of interest) in the design matrix \\\\mathbf{X} are assumed to be fixed in repeated samples. This assumption is considered inappropriate for a predominantly nonexperimental science like econometrics. Instead, the assumptions of the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov theorem are stated conditional on \\\\mathbf{X}. =Linearity= The dependent variable is assumed to be a linear function of the variables specified in the model. The specification must be linear in its parameters. This does not mean that there must be a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The independent variables can take non-linear forms as long as the parameters are linear. The equation y = \\\\beta_{0} + \\\\beta_{1} x^2, qualifies as linear while y = \\\\beta_{0} + \\\\beta_{1}^2 x can be transformed to be linear by replacing \\\\beta_{1}^2 by another parameter, say \\\\gamma. An equation with a parameter dependent on an independent variable does not qualify as linear, for example y = \\\\beta_{0} + \\\\beta_{1}(x) \\\\cdot x, where \\\\beta_{1}(x) is a function of x. Data transformations are often used to convert an equation into a linear form. For example, the Cobb‚ÄìDouglas function‚Äîoften used in economics‚Äîis nonlinear: :Y = A L^\\\\alpha K^{1 - \\\\alpha} e^\\\\varepsilon But it can be expressed in linear form by taking the natural logarithm of both sides: : \\\\ln Y=\\\\ln A + \\\\alpha \\\\ln L + (1 - \\\\alpha) \\\\ln K + \\\\varepsilon = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1 \\\\ln L + \\\\beta_2 \\\\ln K + \\\\varepsilon This assumption also covers specification issues: assuming that the proper functional form has been selected and there are no omitted variables. One should be aware, however, that the parameters that minimize the residuals of the transformed equation not necessarily minimize the residuals of the original equation. =Strict exogeneity= For all n observations, the expectation‚Äîconditional on the regressors‚Äîof the error term is zero: :\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,\\\\varepsilon_{i}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{X} ] = \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,\\\\varepsilon_{i}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x_{1}}, \\\\dots, \\\\mathbf{x_{n}} ] = 0. where \\\\mathbf{x}_i = \\\\begin{bmatrix} x_{i1} & x_{i2} & \\\\dots & x_{ik} \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} is the data vector of regressors for the ith observation, and consequently \\\\mathbf{X} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{x_{1}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}} & \\\\mathbf{x_{2}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}} & \\\\dots & \\\\mathbf{x_{n}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}} \\\\end{bmatrix}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} is the data matrix or design matrix. Geometrically, this assumption implies that \\\\mathbf{x}_{i} and \\\\varepsilon_{i} are orthogonal to each other, so that their inner product (i.e., their cross moment) is zero. :\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,\\\\mathbf{x}_{j} \\\\cdot \\\\varepsilon_{i}\\\\,] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,{x}_{j1} \\\\cdot \\\\varepsilon_{i}\\\\,] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,{x}_{j2} \\\\cdot \\\\varepsilon_{i}\\\\,] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,{x}_{jk} \\\\cdot \\\\varepsilon_{i}\\\\,] \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\mathbf{0} \\\\quad \\\\text{for all } i, j \\\\in n This assumption is violated if the explanatory variables are stochastic, for instance when they are measured with error, or are endogenous. Endogeneity can be the result of simultaneity, where causality flows back and forth between both the dependent and independent variable. Instrumental variable techniques are commonly used to address this problem. =Full rank= The sample data matrix \\\\mathbf{X} must have full column rank. :\\\\operatorname{rank}(\\\\mathbf{X}) = k Otherwise \\\\mathbf{X'X} is not invertible and the OLS estimator cannot be computed. A violation of this assumption is perfect multicollinearity, i.e. some explanatory variables are linearly dependent. One scenario in which this will occur is called \\"dummy variable trap,\\" when a base dummy variable is not omitted resulting in perfect correlation between the dummy variables and the constant term. Multicollinearity (as long as it is not \\"perfect\\") can be present resulting in a less efficient, but still unbiased estimate. The estimates will be less precise and highly sensitive to particular sets of data. Multicollinearity can be detected from condition number or the variance inflation factor, among other tests. =Spherical errors= The outer product of the error vector must be spherical. :\\\\operatorname{E}[\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon^{\\\\mathsf{T}}} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{X} ] = \\\\operatorname{Var}[\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{X} ] = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\sigma^{2} & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\sigma^{2} & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & \\\\sigma^{2} \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\sigma^{2} \\\\mathbf{I} \\\\quad \\\\text{with } \\\\sigma^{2} > 0 This implies the error term has uniform variance (homoscedasticity) and no serial dependence. If this assumption is violated, OLS is still unbiased, but inefficient. The term \\"spherical errors\\" will describe the multivariate normal distribution: if \\\\operatorname{Var}[\\\\,\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{X} ] = \\\\sigma^{2} \\\\mathbf{I} in the multivariate normal density, then the equation f(\\\\varepsilon)=c is the formula for a ball centered at Œº with radius œÉ in n-dimensional space. Heteroskedasticity occurs when the amount of error is correlated with an independent variable. For example, in a regression on food expenditure and income, the error is correlated with income. Low income people generally spend a similar amount on food, while high income people may spend a very large amount or as little as low income people spend. Heteroskedastic can also be caused by changes in measurement practices. For example, as statistical offices improve their data, measurement error decreases, so the error term declines over time. This assumption is violated when there is autocorrelation. Autocorrelation can be visualized on a data plot when a given observation is more likely to lie above a fitted line if adjacent observations also lie above the fitted regression line. Autocorrelation is common in time series data where a data series may experience \\"inertia.\\" If a dependent variable takes a while to fully absorb a shock. Spatial autocorrelation can also occur geographic areas are likely to have similar errors. Autocorrelation may be the result of misspecification such as choosing the wrong functional form. In these cases, correcting the specification is one possible way to deal with autocorrelation. In the presence of spherical errors, the generalized least squares estimator can be shown to be BLUE.

Sprite comics are webcomics that consist primarily of computer sprites from video games. Art assets have been ripped from various classic games such as Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog, are edited and combined by amateur cartoonists, and are posted on the internet. Popularized by Bob and George in the early 2000s, the style is considered relatively easy for beginning cartoonists to get involved in, but sprite comics are generally looked down upon for being of low quality. History The 1998 webcomic Neglected Mario Characters was the first sprite comic to appear on the internet, though Bob and George was the first sprite comic to gain widespread popularity. Starting its run in 2000, Bob and George utilizes sprites from the Mega Man series of games, with most of the characters being taken directly from the games. Bob and George played a significant role in the popularity of sprite comics, as well as webcomics in general. Art assets were ripped from Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance games and were collected in online databases such as The Spriters Resource. A platform game such as Sonic Advance may contain hundreds of sprites of its protagonist running, jumping, and falling, though cartoonists frequently recolored characters or edited them to convey a broader range of emotion. Over time, sprite comic creators collaborated with projects such as the World Spriters Tournament, in which cartoonists let their sprite comic characters fight one another. Few sprite comics have gained mainstream attention since 8-Bit Theater ended in 2010. Though sprite comics are still highly popular among amateur cartoonists, Larry Cruz from Comic Book Resources noted that the aesthetic is played out.  Style and quality Sprite comics mainly use graphics from 1980s video games, such as Mega Man and Final Fantasy. Lore Sj√∂berg from Wired stated that sprite comics \\"re-create the feel of [such games] with a minimum of artistic effort.\\" Penny Arcades Mike Krahulik pointed out that sprite comics are a good way for people who can't draw well to create comics. Cruz pointed out that the aesthetic has \\"evolved and flourished in a variety of media\\" since. However, the style is also commonly criticized. Cruz described sprite comics as \\"the favorite style for the laziest webcomic creators,\\" while Sj√∂berg pointed out that sprite comics are often seen as substandard by comic fans. Both Chris Dlugosz and Michael Zole (Death to the Extremist) have criticized the style, Zole stating that creators of sprite comics \\"seem to think that they're scoring humor points just by reusing old pixelated characters,\\" and Dlugosz devoting his webcomic Pixel explicitly to making fun of the practice. In a review of the webcomic Kid Radd, Dani Atkinson of Sequential Tart noted that people without a gamer background may find that \\"much of the irony and humour in [sprite comics] goes swooshing over [their] head.\\" However, she also praised Kid Radd specifically for using original sprites, unique to the webcomic, allowing for a broader audience. She described this as a \\"fake\\" sprite comic. Legal situation Sprite comics are threatened by legal action, as the graphical sprites used in them are generally protected by copyright. Many sprite comics present themselves as parodies of the works they are based on, and as such they might be protected under fair use. However, seeing as many sprite comics have developed substantial plot-driven stories featuring the copyrighted characters and environments, it is quite possible that a sprite comic creator would lose a lawsuit if a game developer decided to sue. Thus far, no sprite comic has been subject to legal action yet. Capcom has stated that they will never \\"officially endorse\\" sprite comics, though no take-down request has ever taken place.

Guinier's work includes professional responsibilities of public lawyers, the relationship between democracy and the law, the role of race and gender in the political process, college admissions, and affirmative action.

Her uncle is Maurice Paprin. Ewart Guinier was, however, not given financial aid nor was he allowed to live in the dormitories on the purported grounds that he had failed to submit a photograph with his application. After dropping out of Harvard College in 1931 because he could not afford it, he ultimately returned to Harvard as a professor and chair of the Afro-American Studies Department in 1969.

President Clinton withdrew his nomination in June 1993, following a wave of negative press that was brought on by her controversial writings, some of which even Clinton himself called \\"anti-democratic\\" and \\"very difficult to defend\\".\\"Clinton Dumps Nominee\\", Chicago Tribune, June 04, 1993 Conservative journalists, as well as Republican Senators, mounted a campaign against Guinier's nomination. Guinier was dubbed a \\"quota queen\\", a phrase first used in a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Clint Bolick, a Reagan-era Justice Department official.Bolick, Clinton (1993) \\"Clinton's Quota Queens\\", Wall Street Journal op-ed, April 30, 1993. The term was perceived by some to be racially loaded, combining the \\"welfare queen\\" stereotype with \\"quota,\\" a buzzword used to challenge affirmative action.FAIR website In fact, Guinier was an opponent of racial quotas.\\"Lani Guinier - 'Quota Queen or Misquoted Queen?'\\", FAIR, July/August 1993 Some journalists also alleged that Guinier's writings indicated that she supported the shaping of electoral districts to ensure a black majority, a process known as \\"race-conscious districting.\\" One New York Times opinion piece claimed that Guinier was in favor of \\"segregating black voters in black-majority districts.\\" Guinier was portrayed as a racial polarizer who believed‚Äîin the words of George Will‚Äîthat \\"only blacks can represent blacks.\\" In the face of the negative media attention, many Democratic Senators, including David Pryor of Arkansas, Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois (the only African-American serving in the Senate at that time) informed President Clinton that her interviews with senators were going poorly and urged him to withdraw Guinier's nomination.Leff, Laurel (1993), \\"From legal scholar to quota queen: what happens when politics pulls the press into the groves of academe\\", Columbia Journalism Review 32:3 (Sept-Oct 1993) President Clinton took the senators' advice and withdrew Guinier's nomination on June 4, 1993. He stated that Guinier's writings \\"clearly lend themselves to interpretations that do not represent the views I expressed on civil rights during the [presidential] campaign.\\" Guinier, for her part, acknowledged that her writings were often \\"unclear and subject to vastly different interpretations,\\" but believed that the political attacks had distorted and caricatured her academic philosophies. William T. Coleman Jr., who had served as Secretary of Transportation under President Gerald Ford, wrote that the withdrawal was \\"a grave [loss], both for President Clinton and the country. The President's yanking of the nomination, caving in to shrill, unsubstantiated attacks, was not only unfair, but some would say political cowardice.\\"Notable Quotes for 1993 Civil rights theories=Alternative voting systems= In her publications, Guinier has suggested various ideas to strengthen minority groups' voting power, and rectify what she characterizes as an unfair voting system, not just for racial minorities, but for all numerical minority groups, including fundamentalist Christians, the Amish, or in states such as Alabama, Democrats. Guinier has also stated that she does not advocate any single procedural rule, but rather that all alternatives be considered in the context of litigation \\"after the court finds a legal violation.\\"(1994:14) Some of the ideas she considers are: *cumulative voting, a system in which each voter has \\"the same number of votes as there are seats or options to vote for, and they can then distribute their votes in any combination to reflect their preferences\\"--a system often used on corporate boards in 30 states, as well as by school boards and county commissions *multi-member \\"superdistricts\\", a strategy which \\"modifies winner- take-all majority rule to require that something more than a bare majority of voters must approve or concur before action is taken.\\" =Revising affirmative action= Since 2001, Guinier has been active in civil rights in higher education, coining the term \\"confirmative action\\" to reconceptualize issues of diversity, fairness, and affirmative action. The process of confirmative action, she says, \\"ties diversity to the admissions criteria for all students, whatever their race, gender, or ethnic background--including people of color, working-class whites, and even children of privilege\\".Guinier (2001), \\"Colleges Should Take 'Confirmative Action' in Admissions\\" , Chronicle of Higher Education. Retrieved on 28 February 2011. Because public and private institutions of higher learning are almost all to some extent publicly funded (i.e., federal student loans and research grants), Guinier has argued that the nation has a vested interest in seeing that all students have access to higher education and that these graduates \\"contribute as leaders in our democratic polity\\". By linking diversity to merit, Guinier thereby seeks to argue that preferential treatment of minority students \\"confirms the public character and democratic missions of higher-education institutions. Diversity becomes relevant not only to the college's admissions process but also to its students' educational experiences and to what its graduates actually contribute to American society.\\"Guinier (2001), \\"Colleges Should Take 'Confirmative Action' in Admissions\\" , Chronicle of Higher Education.

Without prior knowledge, a practiced cold-reader can quickly obtain a great deal of information by analyzing the person's body language, age, clothing or fashion, hairstyle, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, level of education, manner of speech, place of origin, etc. Cold readings commonly employ high-probability guesses, quickly picking up on signals as to whether their guesses are in the right direction or not, then emphasizing and reinforcing chance connections and quickly moving on from missed guesses. Psychologists believe that this appears to work because of the Forer effect and due to confirmation biases within people.Forer, BR (1949) \\"The fallacy of personal validation: A classroom demonstration of gullibility\\". Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology. 44, 118‚Äì23  Basic procedure  Before starting the actual reading, the reader will typically try to elicit cooperation from the subject, saying something such as, \\"I often see images that are a bit unclear and which may sometimes mean more to you than to me; if you help, we can together uncover new things about you.\\" One of the most crucial elements of a convincing cold reading is a subject eager to make connections or reinterpret vague statements in any way that will help the reader appear to make specific predictions or intuitions. While the reader will do most of the talking, it is the subject who provides the meaning. After determining that the subject is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether verbal or non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem to come from the reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct. Subtle cues such as changes in facial expression or body language can indicate whether a particular line of questioning is effective or not. Combining the techniques of cold reading with information obtained covertly (also called \\"hot reading\\") can leave a strong impression that the reader knows or has access to a great deal of information about the subject. Because the majority of time during a reading is spent dwelling on the \\"hits\\" the reader obtains, while the time spent recognizing \\"misses\\" is minimized, the effect gives an impression that the cold reader knows far more about the subject than an ordinary stranger could. James Underdown from Center for Inquiry and Independent Investigations Group said, \\"In the context of a studio audience full of people, cold reading is not very impressive.\\" Underdown explains cold-reading from a mathematical viewpoint. A typical studio audience consists of approximately 200 people, divided up into three sections. A conservative estimate assumes each person knows 150 people. Underdown says: Mentalist Mark Edward relates from personal experience as a \\"psychic performer\\" how powerful a hit can be when someone in a large audience \\"claims\\" a phrase such as a \\"clown in a graveyard\\" statement. Edward describes a mental image of a clown placing flowers on graves and adds, \\"Does that mean anything to someone?\\" whereupon a woman stands up and claims that he is speaking directly to her. She remembers it as Edward specifically stating that she knew a man who dressed as a clown and placed flowers on graves in her hometown. Edward reports that it took some convincing to get her to understand that he was not directly talking to her, but had thrown the statement out to the entire audience of 300 people. She made the connection, and because it seemed so personal and the situation so odd she felt that he was talking to her directly.  Specific techniques = Shotgunning = \\"Shotgunning\\" is a commonly used cold reading technique. This technique is named after the manner in which a shotgun fires a cluster of small projectiles in the hope that one or more of them will strike the target. The cold reader slowly offers a huge quantity of very general information, often to an entire audience (some of which is very likely to be correct, near correct or at the very least, provocative or evocative to someone present), observes their subjects' reactions (especially their body language), and then narrows the scope, acknowledging particular people or concepts and refining the original statements according to those reactions to promote an emotional response. A majority of people in a room will, at some point for example, have lost an older relative or known at least one person with a common name like \\"Mike\\" or \\"John\\". Shotgunning might include a series of vague statements such as: ;\\"I see a heart problem with a father-figure in your family.\\" :A vast variety of medical problems have chest pain as a symptom, and heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. \\"Father-figure\\" can refer to somebody's father, grandfather, uncle, cousin, or any male relative who is also a parent or has served in a parental role to the person. ;\\"I see a woman with blackness in the chest, lung cancer, heart disease, breast cancer...\\" :Most people will know a woman who was diagnosed with one of these problems, which are among the leading causes of illness and death. ;\\"I sense an older male figure in your life, who wants you to know while you may have had disagreements in your life, he still loved you.\\" :Nearly all people will have had such a person in their lives, and nearly all of them will have had a disagreement. = The Forer effect (Barnum statements) = The Forer effect relies in part on the eagerness of people to fill in details and make connections between what is said and some aspect of their own lives, often searching their entire life's history to find some connection, or reinterpreting statements in a number of different possible ways so as to make it apply to themselves. \\"Barnum statements\\", named after P. T. Barnum, the American showman, are statements that seem personal, yet apply to many people. And while seemingly specific, such statements are often open-ended or give the reader the maximum amount of \\"wiggle room\\" in a reading. They are designed to elicit identifying responses from people. The statements can then be developed into longer and more sophisticated paragraphs and seem to reveal great amounts of detail about a person. A talented and charismatic reader can sometimes even bully a subject into admitting a connection, demanding over and over that they acknowledge a particular statement as having some relevance and maintaining that they are just not thinking hard enough, or are repressing some important memory. Statements of this type might include: * \\"I sense that you are sometimes insecure, especially with people you don't know very well.\\" * \\"You have a box of old unsorted photographs in your house.\\" * \\"You had an accident when you were a child involving water.\\" * \\"You're having problems with a friend or relative.\\" * \\"Your father passed on due to problems in his chest or abdomen.\\" Regarding the last statement, if the subject is old enough, his or her father is quite likely to have died, and this statement would easily apply to a large number of medical conditions. The list includes: heart disease, pneumonia, diabetes, emphysema, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney failure, most types of cancer, and, for that matter, to any cause of death in which cardiac arrest precedes death, or damage to the brainstem responsible for cardiopulmonary function.  Warm reading  Warm reading is a performance tool used by professional mentalists and psychic scam artists.Huston, Peter. (2002). More Scams from the Great Beyond!: How to Make Even More Money Off the Creationism, Evolution, Environmentalism, Fringe Politics, Weird Science, the Occult, and Other Strange Beliefs. Paladin Press. While hot reading is the use of foreknowledge and cold reading works on reacting to the subject's responses, warm reading refers to the judicious use of Barnum effect statements. When these psychological tricks are used properly, the statements give the impression that the mentalist, or psychic scam artist, is intuitively perceptive and psychically gifted. In reality, the statements fit nearly all of humanity, regardless of gender, personal opinions, age, epoch, culture or nationality. Michael Shermer gives the example of jewelry worn by those in mourning. Most people in this situation will be wearing or carrying an item of jewelry with some connection to the person they have lost, but if asked directly in the context of a psychic reading whether they have such an item, the client may be shocked and assume that the reader learned the information directly from the deceased loved one. Robert Todd Carroll notes in The Skeptic's Dictionary that some would consider this to be cold reading.Robert Todd Carroll. \\"Warm Reading\\". The Skeptic's Dictionary. Retrieved 2014-02-10. = The rainbow ruse = The rainbow ruse is a crafted statement which simultaneously awards the subject a specific personality trait, as well as the opposite of that trait. With such a phrase, a cold reader can \\"cover all possibilities\\" and appear to have made an accurate deduction in the mind of the subject, despite the fact that a rainbow ruse statement is vague and contradictory. This technique is used since personality traits are not quantifiable, and also because nearly everybody has experienced both sides of a particular emotion at some time in their lives. Statements of this type include: * \\"Most of the time you are positive and cheerful, but there has been a time in the past when you were very upset.\\" * \\"You are a very kind and considerate person, but when somebody does something to break your trust, you feel deep-seated anger.\\" * \\"I would say that you are mostly shy and quiet, but when the mood strikes you, you can easily become the center of attention.\\" A cold reader can choose from a variety of personality traits, think of its opposite, and then bind the two together in a phrase, vaguely linked by factors such as mood, time, or potential.  Contrasting claims of performers  The mentalist branch of the stage-magician community approves of \\"reading\\" as long as it is presented strictly as an artistic entertainment and one is not pretending to be psychic.The Dance by Brad Henderson, Brad Henderson and Henderson Productions, 2007 Some performers who use cold reading are honest about their use of the technique. Lynne Kelly, Kari Coleman, Ian Rowland, and Derren Brown have used these techniques at either private fortune-telling sessions or open forum \\"talking with the dead\\" sessions in the manner of those who claim to be genuine mediums. Only after receiving acclaim and applause from their audience do they reveal that they needed no psychic power for the performance, only a sound knowledge of psychology and cold reading. In an episode of his Trick of the Mind series broadcast in March 2006, Derren Brown showed how easily people can be influenced through cold reading techniques by repeating Bertram Forer's famous demonstration of the personal validation fallacy, or Forer effect. Sitter misremembering In a detailed review of four sittings conducted by medium Tyler Henry, Edward and Susan Gerbic reviewed all statements made by him on the TV show Hollywood Medium. In their opinion not one statement made by Henry was accurate, yet each sitter felt that their reading was highly successful. In interviews with each sitter after their sitting, all four claimed specific statements made by Henry, but, after reviewing the show, it was shown that he had not made those statements. Each sitter had misremembered what Henry said. One of many examples of this was when Henry, during a session with celebrity Ross Matthews, stated \\"Bambi, why am I connecting to Bambi?\\" Matthews stated that his father, who was a hunter, would not shoot deer because of the movie Bambi. In the post-interview, Matthews stated that \\"It was weird that Henry knew that my father would not shoot deer because of Bambi\\", demonstrating that Matthews did not remember that he, not Henry, had supplied the connection to Bambi. Gerbic has pointed out the broader issue of the human brain attempting to make connections that then make it appear that the psychic was correct. She lists this among a number of techniques or situations that psychics take advantage of.  Subconscious cold reading  Former New Age practitioner Karla McLaren has spoken about developing a system of cold reading without realising, saying in a 2004 interview that \\"I didn't understand that I had long used a form of cold reading in my own work! I was never taught cold reading and I never intended to defraud anyone; I simply picked up the technique through cultural osmosis.\\" McLaren has said that since she was always very perceptive, she could easily figure out many of the issues that people brought into sessions with them. In order to reduce the appearance of unusual expertise that might have created a power differential, she posed her observations as questions rather than facts. This attempt to be polite, she realized, actually invited the other person, as McLaren has said, to \\"lean into the reading\\" and give her more pertinent information. After some people have performed hundreds of readings, their skills may improve to the point where they may start believing they can read minds. They may ask themselves if their success is because of psychology, intuition or a psychic ability. Paramiracles by Ted Lesley, Hermetic Press, 1994 This point of thought is known by some skeptics of the paranormal as the \\"transcendental temptation\\". Magic historian and occult investigator Milbourne Christopher has warned that the transcendental choice may lead one unknowingly into a belief in the occult and a deterioration of reason.ESP, Seers & Psychics: What the Occult Really is by Milbourne Christopher, Thomas Y.

It was settled by men from military garrisons and ships, who married native women from Saint Helena and the Cape Colony. Its people are multi-racial, descended from European male founders and mixed-race (African, Asian and European) and African women founders.  Discovery  Tristan da Cunha on February 6, 2013, as seen from the International Space Station The uninhabited islands of Tristan da Cunha were first sighted in May 1506 during a voyage to India by the Portuguese admiral Trist√£o da Cunha, although rough seas prevented a landing. He named the main island after himself, Ilha de Trist√£o da Cunha, which was later anglicised to Tristan da Cunha Island. His discovery appeared on nautical maps from 1509 and on Mercator's world map of 1541. Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing on Tristan in 1520, when the L√°s Rafael captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called for water.Arnaldo Faustini. The Annals of Tristan da Cunha, p9.  17th century  Though far west of the Cape of Good Hope, the islands were on the preferred route from Europe to the Indian Ocean in the 17th century; ships first crossed the Atlantic to Brazil on the Northeasterly Trades, followed the Brazil Current south to pass the Doldrums, and then picked up the Westerlies to cross the Atlantic again, where they could encounter Tristan da Cunha. The Dutch East India Company required their ships to follow this route, and on 17 February 1643 the crew of the Heemstede, captained by Claes Gerritszoon Bierenbroodspot, made the first confirmed landing. The Heemstede replenished their supplies with fresh water, fish, seals and penguins and left a wooden tablet with the inscription \\"Today, 17 February 1643, from the Dutch fluyt Heemstede, Claes Gerritsz Bierenbroodspot from Hoorn and Jan Coertsen van den Broec landed here.\\". Thereafter, the Dutch East India Company returned to the area four more times to explore whether the islands could function as a supply base for their ships. The first stop was in 5 September 1646 on a voyage to Batavia, Dutch East Indies, and the second was an expedition by the galliot Nachtglas (Nightglass), which left from Cape Town on 22 November 1655. The crew of the Nachtglas noticed the tablet left by the Heemstede on 10 January 1656 near a watering place. They left a wooden tablet themselves as well, like they also did on Nachtglas Eijland (now Inaccessible Island). The Nachtglas, commanded by Jan Jacobszoon van Amsterdam, examined Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island and made rough charts for the Dutch East India Company. Dutch sailors also stayed on the island for four weeks in 1658, and made their last stop in April 1669, when their idea of utilizing the islands as a supply base was abandoned, probably due to the absence of a safe harbour. In the 17th century ships were also sent from Saint Helena by the English East India Company to Tristan to report on a proposed settlement there, but that project also came to nothing.  18th century  The first survey of the archipelago was made by the French corvette Heure du Berger in 1767. Soundings were taken and a rough survey of the coastline was made. The presence of water at the large waterfall of Big Watron and in a lake on the north coast were noted, and the results of the survey were published by a Royal Navy hydrographer in 1781. A British naval officer who visited the group in 1760 gave his name to Nightingale Island. John Patten, the master of an English merchant ship, and part of his crew lived on Tristan from August 1790 to April 1791, during which time they captured 3600 seals. The first known attempt to climb Queen Mary's Peak was in 1793 by the French naturalist Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars, but this was without success. He did collect and catalogue hundreds of plants from this expedition.  19th century  Jonathan Lambert During this time American whalers frequented the neighboring waters, and in December 1810 an American named Jonathan Lambert \\"late of Salem, mariner and citizen thereof,\\" along with an Italian named Thomas Currie (anglicized version) and another named Williams, made Tristan their home, establishing the first permanent settlement on the island.Mackay, Margaret (1963) Angry Island: The Story of Tristan da Cunha, 1506‚Äì1963. London: Arthur Barker, p. 30 Lambert declared himself sovereign and sole possessor of the group (which he renamed Islands of Refreshment) \\"grounding my right and claim on the rational and sure ground of absolute occupancy\\". Lambert's sovereignty was short lived, as he and Williams were drowned while out fishing in May 1812. Currie was joined, however, by two other men and they began to cultivate vegetables, wheat and oats, and breed pigs. War having broken out in 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom, the islands were largely used as a base by American cruisers sent to prey on British merchant ships. This and other considerations urged by Lord Charles Somerset, then governor of Cape Colony, led the British government to authorize taking \\"possession\\" of the islands as dependencies of the Cape. The formal proclamation of annexation was made on 14 August 1816. The British wanted to ensure that the French, their repeated enemies, would not be able to use the islands as a base for a rescue operation to free Napoleon Bonaparte from his prison on Saint Helena. Attempts to colonize Inaccessible Island failed. The islands were occupied by a garrison of British Marines, and a civilian population was gradually built up. Whalers also set up on the islands as a base for operations in the Southern Atlantic. In January 1817 the first successful climb was made to the peak of Queen Mary's Peak. A small garrison was maintained on Tristan until November 1817. At their own request William Glass (d. 1853), a Scottish corporal from Kelso in the Royal Artillery, was left behind with his wife, two children and, two masons. Thus was begun the present settlement. From time to time additional settlers arrived or shipwrecked mariners decided to remain. In 1827 they persuaded five coloured women (these were of mixed race: African, Asian and European) from Saint Helena to migrate to Tristan to become the wives of the five desperate bachelors then on the island. Later, African women from Cape Colony married residents in the island. Other male settlers were of Dutch and Italian origin. As a consequence of this history, the inhabitants are of mixed race. DNA studies have shown that the founding men were primarily of European ancestry. Glass ruled over the little community from 1817 to 1853 in patriarchal fashion. Besides raising crops, the settlers possessed numbers of cattle, sheep and pigs. Their most lucrative occupation was seal-fishing. The island was still frequented by American whalers. In 1856, 25 people emigrated to the United States, out of a total island population of about 100. The next year 45 of the inhabitants removed to Cape Colony. Since then other younger or more restless members of the community have emigrated there; some took to a seafaring life. The inhabitants settled on the plain on the north-west of Tristan, as it was the only level land. Here a number of substantial stone cottages and a church were built. Pieter Willemszoon Groen (1808‚Äì1902), known as Peter William Green, was the \\"uncrowned king of Tristan da Cunha\\" After the death of Glass, the head of the community for some time was a named Cotton, who had served on a man of war ship, and for three years had been guard over Napoleon at Saint Helena. Cotton was succeeded by Peter William Green (anglicised from Pieter Willemszoon Groen), a native of Katwijk aan Zee, who had settled in the island in 1836. During Green's \\"reign,\\" the economic condition of Tristan suffered by the loss of ship traffic of the whalers. This was largely due to the outbreak of the American Civil War diverting resources. In addition, the Confederate cruisers CSS Alabama and CSS Shenandoah, captured and burned many Union whaling ships. As a result, the number of ships calling at Tristan considerably diminished and trade languished. With the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, together with the gradual transition from sailing ships to coal-fired steam ships, the isolation of the islands increased. They were no longer needed as a stopping port for sailing journeys from Europe to the Far East. Most ships went through the canal for a shorter route. In 1867, Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh and second son of Queen Victoria, visited the islands. The main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, was named in honour of his visit. In October 1873 the islands were carefully surveyed by the Challenger. Captain George Nares recorded that upon the ship's arrival, the men of Tristan came forward offering potatoes, albatross eggs, and other provisions to his crew.. The Captain recorded a total of 15 families and 86 individuals living on the island. This expedition also aided two German brothers named Stoltenhoff, in moving to the mainland at Cape Town. They had been living on Inaccessible Island since November 1871. They were the only ones to have attempted colonization of any island except the main one. In 1880 the population appears to have attained its maximum. In 1885 the islanders encountered disaster. A poor winter had left them short of food, and a boat sent to barter with a ship offshore was lost with all hands--fifteen men. Only four adult males were left on the island. At the same time a plague of rats-- survivors of a shipwrecked vessel--wrought much havoc among the crops. The British government planned to remove all the inhabitants to the Cape, but the majority preferred to remain. Stores and provisions were sent out to them by the British government. The ravages of the rats rendered the growing of wheat impossible; the wealth of the islanders now consisted of their cattle, sheep, potatoes, and apple and peach trees, and the only form of currency was the potato. The population in 1897 was only 64; in 1901 it was 74, and in 1909, 95. Tristan da Cunha's residents managed their own affairs without any written laws. The inhabitants have been described as moral, religious, hospitable to strangers, well-mannered and industrious, healthy and long-lived. They lack intoxicating liquors and were said to commit no crimes. , there have been no divorces. They were daring sailors, and in small canvas boats of their own building voyage to Nightingale and Inaccessible islands. They knit garments from the wool of their sheep, are good carpenters, and make serviceable carts. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel recruited the first missionary to the island, Rev. William F. Taylor, who served from 1851 to 1856. After his departure, the Bishop of St. Helena attempted to establish an Anglican mission on the island from 1866 onward, and this post was finally filled by Lewis Carroll's youngest brother, the Reverend Edwin Heron Dodgson, who arrived on the island 25 February 1881. Shortly after his arrival he recorded 16 families and 107 individuals living on the island. Reverend Dodgson returned to England in February 1885 and attempted to arrange for the evacuation of the Tristan, meeting with Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, citing dangerous isolation, but the evacuation was deemed impracticable. Following a disaster at sea that killed fifteen islanders, a large proportion of the working men, Dodgson returned to Tristan in 1886 and remained until December 1889.  20th century  In 1906 the islanders passed through a period of distress owing to great mortality among the cattle and the almost total failure of the potato crop. The majority again refused, however, to desert the island, though offered allotments of land in Cape Colony. Similar proposals were made and declined several times since the question was first mooted in 1886. A series of Anglican missionaries served the island parish: Rev. J. G. Barrow and his wife Katherine (1906‚Äì1909), Rev. H. M. Rogers and his wife Rose Annie (1922‚Äì1925), Rev. R. A. C. Pooley (1927‚Äì1929), Rev. A. G. Partridge (1929‚Äì1932), Rev. Harold Wilde (1934‚Äì1940). A 1938 stamp of Saint Helena overprinted for use in Tristan da Cunha from 1952. On 12 January 1938, by Letters Patent, the islands were declared a dependency of Saint Helena. Prior to this, passing ships stopped irregularly at the island for a period of mere hours.By Wireless from R.M.S. Empress of Australia. \\"Royal Gifts Gladden 172 On Lonely Atlantic Island\\" (Tristan da Cunya),\\" New York Times. 24 March 1935. During World War II, the islands were used as a top secret Royal Navy weather and radio station codenamed HMS Atlantic Isle, to monitor U Boats (which needed to surface to maintain radio contact) and German shipping movements in the South Atlantic Ocean. The only currency in use on the island at this time was the potato, and islanders labouring to construct the station were paid in kind with naval supplies for their own use, such as wood, paint and tea. Money was introduced the following year, as was the island's first newspaper, The Tristan Times. The first Administrator, Surgeon Lieutenant Commander E.J.S. Woolley, was appointed by the British government during this time. The second Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, visited the islands in 1957 as part of a world tour on board the royal yacht Britannia. In 1958 as part of an experiment, Operation Argus, the United States Navy detonated an atomic bomb high in the upper atmosphere about southeast of the main island. The 1961 eruption of Queen Mary's Peak forced the evacuation of the entire populationhttp://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1806-01= via Cape Town to wooden huts in the disused Pendell Army Camp in Merstham, Surrey, England, before moving to a more permanent site at a former Royal Air Force station in Calshot near Southampton, England, living mainly in a road called Tristan Close. In 1962, a Royal Society expedition went to the islands to assess the damage, and reported that the settlement Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had been only marginally affected. Most families returned in 1963 led by Willie Repetto (head of the ten-person island council) and Allan Crawford (the former island welfare officer). 21st century On 23 May 2001, the islands experienced an extratropical cyclone that generated winds up to . A number of structures were severely damaged and a large number of cattle were killed, prompting emergency aid from the British government. In 2005, the islands were given a United Kingdom post code (TDCU 1ZZ) to make it easier for the residents to order goods online. The St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 was made by Her Majesty the Queen and the Privy Council on 8 July and came into operation on 1 September 2009. The new Constitution replaced the 1988 version and among other changes limited the Governor's powers, included a Bill of Rights, established independence of the judiciary and the public service and formally designated the Governor of St Helena as, concurrently, the Governor for Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It also ended the \\"dependency\\" status of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha on St Helena. On 4 December 2007 an outbreak of an acute virus-induced flu was reported. This outbreak was compounded by Tristan's lack of suitable and sufficient medical supplies. The British coastguard in Falmouth co-ordinated international efforts to get appropriate medicines to Tristan to treat the virus. Tristan's elderly population and the very young were most at risk; however, only four elderly people were hospitalised. Royal Fleet Auxiliary Vessel RFA Gold Rover upon reaching the island with the required medical supplies found no emergency and the islanders in good general health. On 13 February 2008, fire destroyed the fishing factory and the four generators that supplied power to the island. Backup generators were used to power the hospital and give power for part of the day to the rest of the island. Power was on during the day and early evening and candlelight was used the rest of the time. On 14 March 2008, new generators were installed and uninterrupted power was restored. This fire was devastating to the island because fishing is a mainstay of the economy. Royal Engineers from the British Army worked on the harbour to help maintain it, as everything comes and goes by sea. This was supported by a LSDA vessel Lyme Bay from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The concrete topping put in place has subsequently been badly damaged and on-going repairs will be required to keep the harbour from breaking apart in winter storms. On 16 March 2011, the Maltese-registered freighter MS Oliva ran aground on Nightingale Island, spilling tons of heavy fuel oil into the ocean. The crew were rescued, but the ship broke up, leaving an oil slick that surrounded the island, threatening its population of rockhopper penguins. Nightingale Island has no fresh water, so the penguins were transported to Tristan da Cunha for cleaning.BBC News Oil-soaked rockhopper penguins in rehabilitation The Greek captain and his 21 Filipino crew stayed in Edinburgh of the Seven Seas and assisted the islanders in their work.Saint Helena Independent 25 March 2011 p. 3 In November 2011 the Volvo Ocean Race boat Puma's Mar Mostro headed to the island after the mast came down to meet a supporting vessel in the first leg between Alicante (Spain) and Cape Town (South Africa). This event put the archipelago in the world press that were reporting the race, making it known to a larger public.

As in the matrix case, normality means commutativity is preserved, to the extent possible, in the noncommutative setting. This makes normal operators, and normal elements of C*-algebras, more amenable to analysis. The spectral theorem states that a matrix is normal if and only if it is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, and therefore any matrix satisfying the equation is diagonalizable. Special cases Among complex matrices, all unitary, Hermitian, and skew-Hermitian matrices are normal. Likewise, among real matrices, all orthogonal, symmetric, and skew-symmetric matrices are normal. However, it is not the case that all normal matrices are either unitary or (skew-)Hermitian. For example, :A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} is neither unitary, Hermitian, nor skew-Hermitian, yet it is normal because :AA^* = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 2 \\\\end{pmatrix} = A^*A.  Consequences  :Proposition: A normal triangular matrix is diagonal. :Proof: Let be any normal upper triangular matrix. Since :: , :using subscript notation, one can write the equivalent expression using instead the th unit vector (\\\\,\\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i\\\\,) to select the th row and th column: ::\\\\hat\\\\mathrm e_i^\\\\mathsf T \\\\left(A^* A\\\\right) \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i = \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i^\\\\mathsf T \\\\left(A A^*\\\\right) \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i\\\\,. :The expression ::\\\\left( A \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i \\\\right)^* \\\\left( A \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i\\\\right) = \\\\left( A^* \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i \\\\right)^* \\\\left( A^* \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i\\\\right)\\\\, :is equivalent, and so is ::\\\\left \\\\A \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i \\\\right\\\\^2 = \\\\left \\\\A^* \\\\hat \\\\mathrm e_i \\\\right \\\\^2\\\\,, :which shows that the th row must have the same norm as the th column. :Consider . The first entry of row 1 and column 1 are the same (because of normality), and the rest of column 1 is zero (because of triangularity). This implies the first row must be zero for entries 2 through . Continuing this argument for row‚Äìcolumn pairs 2 through shows is diagonal.'''''' The concept of normality is important because normal matrices are precisely those to which the spectral theorem applies: :Proposition. A matrix is normal if and only if there exists a diagonal matrix and a unitary matrix such that . The diagonal entries of are the eigenvalues of , and the columns of are the eigenvectors of . The matching eigenvalues in come in the same order as the eigenvectors are ordered as columns of . Another way of stating the spectral theorem is to say that normal matrices are precisely those matrices that can be represented by a diagonal matrix with respect to a properly chosen orthonormal basis of . Phrased differently: a matrix is normal if and only if its eigenspaces span and are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the standard inner product of . The spectral theorem for normal matrices is a special case of the more general Schur decomposition which holds for all square matrices. Let be a square matrix. Then by Schur decomposition it is unitary similar to an upper- triangular matrix, say, . If is normal, so is . But then must be diagonal, for, as noted above, a normal upper-triangular matrix is diagonal. The spectral theorem permits the classification of normal matrices in terms of their spectra, for example: :Proposition. A normal matrix is unitary if and only if all of its eigenvalues (its spectrum) lie on the unit circle of the complex plane. :Proposition. A normal matrix is self-adjoint if and only if its spectrum is contained in \\\\R. In other words: A normal matrix is Hermitian if and only if all its eigenvalues are real. In general, the sum or product of two normal matrices need not be normal. However, the following holds: :Proposition. If and are normal with , then both and are also normal. Furthermore there exists a unitary matrix such that and are diagonal matrices. In other words and are simultaneously diagonalizable. In this special case, the columns of are eigenvectors of both and and form an orthonormal basis in . This follows by combining the theorems that, over an algebraically closed field, commuting matrices are simultaneously triangularizable and a normal matrix is diagonalizable ‚Äì the added result is that these can both be done simultaneously.  Equivalent definitions  It is possible to give a fairly long list of equivalent definitions of a normal matrix. Let be a complex matrix. Then the following are equivalent: # is normal. # is diagonalizable by a unitary matrix. # There exists a set of eigenvectors of which forms an orthonormal basis for . # \\\\left\\\\ Ax \\\\right\\\\ = \\\\left\\\\ A^* x \\\\right\\\\ for every . # The Frobenius norm of can be computed by the eigenvalues of : \\\\operatorname{tr} \\\\left(A^* A\\\\right) = \\\\sum olimits_j \\\\left \\\\lambda_j \\\\right^2 . # The Hermitian part and skew-Hermitian part of commute. # is a polynomial (of degree ) in .Proof: When is normal, use Lagrange's interpolation formula to construct a polynomial such that , where are the eigenvalues of . # for some unitary matrix .Horn, pp. 109 # and commute, where we have the polar decomposition with a unitary matrix and some positive semidefinite matrix . # commutes with some normal matrix with distinct eigenvalues. # for all where has singular values and eigenvalues . # The operator norm of a normal matrix equals the numerical and spectral radii of . (This fact generalizes to normal operators.) Explicitly, this means: #:\\\\sup_{ \\\\left\\\\ x \\\\right\\\\ = 1 } \\\\left\\\\ A\\\\,x \\\\right\\\\ = \\\\sup_{ \\\\left\\\\ x \\\\right\\\\ = 1 } \\\\left x^* A\\\\,x \\\\right = \\\\max \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\left \\\\lambda \\\\right : \\\\lambda \\\\in \\\\sigma(A) \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Some but not all of the above generalize to normal operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. For example, a bounded operator satisfying (9) is only quasinormal. Analogy It is occasionally useful (but sometimes misleading) to think of the relationships of different kinds of normal matrices as analogous to the relationships between different kinds of complex numbers: * Invertible matrices are analogous to non-zero complex numbers * The conjugate transpose is analogous to the complex conjugate * Unitary matrices are analogous to complex numbers on the unit circle * Hermitian matrices are analogous to real numbers * Hermitian positive definite matrices are analogous to positive real numbers * Skew Hermitian matrices are analogous to purely imaginary numbers As a special case, the complex numbers may be embedded in the normal 2√ó2 real matrices by the mapping :a + bi \\\\mapsto \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\\\\\\\\\ -b & a \\\\end{bmatrix} = a\\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} + b\\\\, \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\,. which preserves addition and multiplication. It is easy to check that this embedding respects all of the above analogies.  See also  *Hermitian matrix *Least-squares normal matrix  Notes  References  * .

The procession featured an elephant named Hanno, as a gift to the pope, and forty-two other beasts, including two leopards, a panther, some parrots, turkeys and rare Indian horses. Hanno carried a platform of silver on its back, shaped as a castle containing a safe with royal gifts, including vests embroidered with pearls and gems, and coins of gold minted for the occasion. The pope received the procession in the Castel Sant'Angelo.

On September 2, 2011, programming contact through the ReplayTV dialup system was terminated without any update message being sent to subscribers or posted on replaytv.com. DNNA filed for bankruptcy on July 20, 2015. EPG data from their servers ran out on July 15, 2015. Even with the end of support from DNNA, third party solutions are available to provide Electronic Program Guide data to Replays. History ReplayTV was founded in 1997. Initial sales to consumers were launched in April 1999, while volume production and sales did not begin until later in 2000. ReplayTV was purchased by SONICblue in 2001. On March 23, 2003, SONICblue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and on April 16 sold most of its assets, including ReplayTV, to the Japanese electronics giant D&M; Holdings. SONICblue was fighting a copyright infringement suit over the ReplayTV's ability to skip commercials when it filed for bankruptcy. On December 19, 2005, Digital Networks North America announced that it was exiting the hardware business as soon as current inventory was sold out. ReplayTV would then concentrate on PC software sales of its DVR technology in a partnership with Hauppauge Computer Works, a manufacturer of television cards for PCs. On December 13, 2007, D&M; Holdings sold most of the assets of ReplayTV to DirecTV. It still provided electronic program guide service to existing customers, using content from Tribune Media Services. The domains replay.com, replaytv.com, and replaytv.net used by the ReplayTV units to access the electronic program guide are owned by DirecTV. On June 15, 2011, D&M; Holdings announced it was permanently discontinuing the ReplayTV electronic program guide service: > \\"The ReplayTV Electronic Programming Guide (EPG) Service will be permanently > discontinued on July 31, 2011. After this date, owners of ReplayTV DVR units > will still be able to manually record analog TV programs, but will not have > the benefit of access to the interactive program guide. Effective > immediately, monthly billing for the ReplayTV service to remaining customers > has been suspended.\\" On June 14, 2011, D&M; announced they would continue providing guide service. The following was appearing on the ReplayTV website: > Important Announcement. After the announced shutdown of the ReplayTV > programming guide service, we have had many positive, enthusiastic comments > about the ReplayTV DVR products and services. In light of this response, > ReplayTV and its parent company Digital Networks North America, Inc. have > decided to continue the electronic programming guide service pursuant to the > terms of your service activation agreement. We thank you very much for all > of your support and enthusiasm over the many years these products have been > sold. Around July 4, 2015, new guide data was not being sent to ReplayTV units. The last day of guide data was July 15. ReplayTV said they were working on the problem, although it was never fixed. It is assumed this problem is a result of the bankruptcy. Bankruptcy On July 20, 2015, ReplayTV.com had this posting > Digital Networks North America, Inc. filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief > with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware on July > 20, 2015 and has ceased all business operations. A chapter 7 trustee will be > appointed by the Bankruptcy Court to oversee the administration and > liquidation of the bankruptcy estate for Digital Networks North America, > Inc. Creditors will receive a notice of the bankruptcy filing by mail. Bankruptcy confirmed. Legal battle On October 31, 2001, numerous TV companies, including the three major networks, filed a lawsuit against SONICblue, which at the time marketed the ReplayTV device. They alleged that the ReplayTV 4000 series was part of an ‚Äúunlawful scheme‚Äù that ‚Äúattacks the fundamental economic underpinnings of free television and basic nonbroadcast services‚Äù according to the lawsuit. The TV industry attacked ReplayTV for two reasons: #The machines enabled people to record television programs and then watch them without commercials via the optional \\"Commercial Advance\\" feature. This had the potential to undercut advertising revenues which the lawsuit called \\"the lifeblood of most television channels\\". #The machines allowed users to share programs they have recorded with others via the \\"Send Show\\" feature, which transmits digital copies of shows not only on a local network, but also over the Internet to other ReplayTV owners, thereby enabling people who had not paid for premium channels to watch premium content for free. Both the ‚ÄúCommercial Advance‚Äù and the ‚ÄúSend Show‚Äù features were alleged to violate U.S. copyright and other federal and state laws, according to the TV industry plaintiffs, who wanted sales of the ReplayTV 4000 devices‚Äîslated for shipment on Nov. 15, 2001‚Äîstopped. The lawsuit against SONICblue was stayed when the company filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2003. In August 2003, the ReplayTV 5500 series went on sale without the Autoskip and Send Show features though the features continued to be enabled on the earlier models. Operation ReplayTV service is only available in the United States via its subscription program. The hardware is no longer sold and the subscription service was ended in June 2011. The subscriptions service's feature of searchable program guides will end effective July 31, 2011. After this date, owners of ReplayTV DVR units will still be able to manually record analog TV programs, but will not have the benefit of access to the interactive program guide. Older units were only able to accomplish this download via a dial-up connection. Later models were also capable of downloading program guides via the user's existing internet connection (broadband or DSL), as well as via the dialup connection. Like other DVRs, ReplayTV allows users to record television programs. The subscription service was operated on a monthly fee, or one time payment, lifetime subscription. Each individual unit required a separate subscription. Older units, like the 2000 and 3000 series, did not require monthly subscription fees, and those units that are still in operation continue to receive programming data without a subscription until July 31, 2011. The price of the original ReplayTV units was higher than comparable TiVo units by approximately the same amount as TiVo's lifetime subscription, so a lifetime subscription was essentially priced into the units. Some ReplayTV models allow automatic commercial skipping with no user intervention. It scanned for the black frames local television stations used to insert commercials. Hardware and features The \\"4000 Series\\" and \\"5000 Series\\" ReplayTV units have Ethernet connections that allow the user to stream shows to another similar ReplayTV unit within the same local network, transfer shows to another similar ReplayTV unit (either on the local network or across the Internet) or to a personal computer. This capability enables users to move recorded programs to PCs using third-party programs. These units also have the capability to automatically skip commercial advertisements during playback (known as \\"Commercial Advance\\", which was trademarked by the original company). This commercial advance feature used several heuristics to detect commercials and had an accuracy of about 90 to 95 percent. Recording of television programs could be accomplished either manually, or through use of the program guide using various criteria. Shows to be recorded could also be described via thematic categories. The most recent \\"5500 Series\\" ReplayTV units had the ability to stream shows to another similar ReplayTV unit within the same local network, but when loaded with up-to-date system software they can no longer transfer shows to other ReplayTV units across the Internet. The \\"5500 Series\\" units have also had the automatic commercial advance feature removed in favor of a manual \\"ShowNav\\" feature. The units are otherwise identical to the \\"5000 Series\\" units. System software releases prior to version 5.1 build 144 retain the original features even in 5500-series hardware devices, but the software is automatically updated to 5.1 build 144 via through-the-web software updates. The \\"4000 Series\\", \\"5000 Series\\" and \\"5500 Series\\" ReplayTV units stored the content using MPEG2. :*Video: mpeg2video, yuv420p, 720x480, 29.97 frame/s, 7413 kbit/s :*Audio: mp2, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbit/s The operating system used on the \\"4000 Series\\", \\"5000 Series\\" and \\"5500 Series\\" was Vxworks. Several versions of the software were released, some older versions supported commercial advance even on newer units. Undocumented Features Beginning with the earliest models, ReplayTV units had an undocumented \\"random access skip\\" feature. While playing a recorded program, the user could enter a number from the remote control, then press the \\"Quick Skip\\" button to advance that number of minutes forward in the program, or press the \\"Skip Back\\" button to go back that number of minutes. If no number was entered, the skip buttons would advance 30 seconds or retreat 10 seconds, respectively. This feature spanned several models of ReplayTV. Models The first models released were the 2000 series from ReplayTV (the company name at that time). In 1999, the price of the ReplayTV 2001 was $995 and it provided 6 hours of video storage. The ReplayTV model 2004 was $1995 and provided 26 hours. Each of these models included a lifetime offer of program guide service. The ReplayTV 2020 model, offering 20 hours of recording storage, was also released in 1999 at a cost of $699. It replaced the previously released models. In the year 2000 the 3000-series models were released, as well as an equivalent \\"ShowStopper\\" model branded by Panasonic. This was followed by the 4000 line in the fall of 2001. The 4000-series models were the first to include an ethernet port, and to support the sharing of shows between different units either locally (using video streaming) or over the Internet (by duplicating the content). In 2002 the 4500-series was released. These had hardware that was much like the 4000-series, but they could be purchased without lifetime program guide service for a substantially reduced price. All subsequent models also unbundled the guide service from the hardware. Units without lifetime activation become almost completely unusable if the monthly activation is terminated. 2005 products with list prices (no longer available): * ReplayTV RTV5504 40-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($149.99) * ReplayTV RTV5508 80-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($299.99) * ReplayTV RTV5516 160-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($449.99) * ReplayTV RTV5532 320-Hour Digital Video Recorder ($799.99) The ReplayTV 5000 series included a JP1 remote which could be reprogrammed or upgraded using free software. Subscription The ReplayTV subscription has two different options, a monthly recurring charge of $12.95, or one-time lifetime activation fee of $299. Subscriptions for additional units were $6.95 a month. PC edition customers are charged $20 per year and come with one year of service. On June 15, 2011, ReplayTV announced that it would be permanently discontinuing its Electronic Programming Guide Service (the channel guide) on July 31, 2011. \\"After this day, your ReplayTV DVR will still be able to manually record analog TV programs, but will not have the benefit of access to the interactive program guide. All billing for your service has been suspended.\\" Their website states the reasoning as being that the industry conversion to HDTV is complete, and customers should contact their local providers for options. However, there may be options to keep service alive after official support ends using the WiRNS application as all units should be permanently activated if they contact ReplayTV servers before July 31, 2011. On July 29, 2011, D&M; Holdings reversed their previous decision and will continue the ReplayTV electronic program guide service. \\"For monthly subscribers of the ReplayTV service, we are exploring options by which you may continue paying for and receiving such service going forward. We apologize in advance should there be any minor disruptions in the ReplayTV service while we implement the continuation of the programming guide. Thank you. ReplayTV\\" On or around July 4, 2015, DirectTV apparently turned off their guide servers at production.replaytv.net. On July 15, 2015, the last guide data disappeared from ReplayTV units; it is doubtful that the guide data will return. However, alternatives exist which can provide ReplayTVs with guide data for as long as they (the Replay units themselves) are functional. Three such options are LaHO, WiRNS and Perc Data.

Copal is still used by a number of indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America as an incense, during sweat lodge ceremonies and sacred mushroom ceremonies. It is available in different forms. The hard, amber-like yellow copal is a less expensive version. The white copal, a hard, milky, sticky substance, is a more expensive version of the same resin. Copal resin from Hymenaea verrucosa (Fabaceae) is found in East Africa and is used in incense. By the 18th century, Europeans found it to be a valuable ingredient in making a good wood varnish. It became widely used in the manufacture of furniture and carriages. It was also sometimes used as a picture varnish.Mayer, Ralph (1976). The Artist's Handbook of Materials and Techniques. New York: Viking. pp. 194‚Äì196 By the late 19th and early 20th century varnish manufacturers in England and America were using it on train carriages, greatly swelling its demand. In 1859 Americans consumed 68 percent of the East African trade, which was controlled through the Sultan of Zanzibar, with Germany receiving 24 percent. The American Civil War and the creation of the Suez Canal led to Germany, India and Hong Kong taking the majority by the end of that century.Thaddeus Sunseri, Wielding the Ax: State Forestry and Social Conflict in Tanzania, 1820-2000, 2009, p 10-12 East Africa apparently had a higher amount of subfossil copal, which is found one or two meters below living copal trees, from roots of trees that may have lived thousands of years earlier. This subfossil copal produces a harder varnish. Subfossil copal is also well known from New Zealand (kauri gum from Agathis australis (Araucariaceae)), Japan, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Madagascar. It often has inclusions and is sometimes sold as \\"young amber\\". When it is treated or enhanced in an autoclave (as is sometimes done to industrialized Baltic amberBaltic Amber - Autoclave Treatment & Effect on Insect Inclusions.pdf, POLISH JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY ) it is used for jewelry. In its natural condition copal can be easily distinguished from old amber by its lighter citrine colour and its surface getting tacky with a drop of acetone or chloroform.David Grimaldi, Amber: Window to the Past, 1996, p 16-20, American Museum of Natural History Copal that is partly mineralized is known as copaline.

In novels (or sometimes sequences of novels) with a serious intent, this is often a thematic device used to portray particular historical events, changes of social circumstances, or the ebb and flow of fortunes from a multitude of perspectives.

It is preceded by Shrove Tuesday and falls on the first day of Lent, the six weeks of penitence before Easter. Ash Wednesday is traditionally observed by Western Catholics. It is observed by Anglicans, most Latin Rite Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Methodists, Moravians and Independent Catholics, as well many from the Reformed faith. As it is the first day of Lent, some Catholics begin Ash Wednesday by marking a Lenten calendar, praying a Lenten daily devotional, and making a Lenten sacrifice that they will not partake of until the arrival of Eastertide. Ash Wednesday derives its name from the placing of repentance ashes on the foreheads of participants to either the words \\"Repent, and believe in the Gospel\\" or the dictum \\"Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\\" The ashes are prepared by burning palm leaves from the previous year's Palm Sunday celebrations. Observances=Fasting and abstinence= Jesus Tempted in the Wilderness (J√©sus tent√© dans le d√©sert), James Tissot, Brooklyn Museum Many Catholic denominations emphasize fasting, as well as abstinence during the season of Lent and in particular, on its first day, Ash Wednesday. The First Council of Nic√¶a spoke of Lent as a period of fasting for forty days, in preparation for Eastertide. In many places, Catholic historically abstained from food for a whole day until the evening, and at sunset, Western Catholic traditionally broke the Lenten fast, which is often known as the Black Fast. In India and Pakistan, many Catholics continue this practice of fasting until sunset on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, with some fasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent. In the Roman Catholic Church, Ash Wednesday is observed by fasting, abstinence from meat, and repentancea day of contemplating one's transgressions. On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, Roman Catholics between the ages of 18 and 59 (whose health enables them to do so) are permitted to consume one full meal, along with two smaller meals, which together should not equal the full meal. Some Catholics will go beyond the minimum obligations put forth by the Church and undertake a complete fast or a bread and water fast until sunset. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are also days of abstinence from meat (mammals and fowl), as are all Fridays during Lent.1983 Code of Canon Law, canon 1251 Some Roman Catholics continue fasting throughout Lent, as was the Church's traditional requirement,1917 Code of Canon Law, canon 1252 ¬ß¬ß2‚Äì3 concluding only after the celebration of the Easter Vigil. Where the Ambrosian Rite is observed, the day of fasting and abstinence is postponed to the first Friday in the Ambrosian Lent, nine days later. A number of Lutheran parishes teach communicants to fast on Ash Wednesday, with some people choosing to continue doing so throughout the entire season of Lent, especially on Good Friday. One Lutheran congregation's A Handbook for the Discipline of Lent recommends that the faithful \\"Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day, usually without meat\\". In the Church of England, and throughout much of the Worldwide Anglican Communion, the entire forty days of Lent are designated days of fasting, while the Fridays are also designated as days of abstinence in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, with the Traditional Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion defining \\"Fasting, usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one half meal, on the forty days of Lent.\\" The same text defines abstinence as refraining from flesh meat on all Fridays of the Church Year, except for those during Christmastide. The historic Methodist homilies regarding the Sermon on the Mount stress the importance of the Lenten fast, which begins on Ash Wednesday. The United Methodist Church therefore states that: Rev. Jacqui King, the minister of Nu Faith Community United Methodist Church in Houston explained the philosophy of fasting during Lent as \\"I'm not skipping a meal because in place of that meal I'm actually dining with God\\". The Reformed Church in America describes Ash Wednesday as a day \\"focused on prayer, fasting, and repentance.\\" The liturgy for Ash Wednesday thus contains the following \\"Invitation to Observe a Lenten Discipline\\" read by the presider: Many of the Churches in the Reformed tradition retained the Lenten fast in its entirety, although it was made voluntary, rather than obligatory. =Ashes= A priest marks a cross of ashes on a worshipper's forehead, the prevailing form in English-speaking countries. Ashes are ceremonially placed on the heads of Catholics on Ash Wednesday, either by being sprinkled over their heads or, in English-speaking countries, more often by being marked on their foreheads as a visible cross. The words (based on Genesis 3:19) used traditionally to accompany this gesture are, \\"Memento, homo, quia pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.\\" (\\"Remember, man, that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return.\\") This custom is credited to Pope Gregory I the Great (c. 540‚Äì604). In the 1969 revision of the Roman Rite, an alternative formula (based on Mark 1:15) was introduced \\"Repent, and believe in the Gospel\\" and the older formula was translated as \\"Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\\" The old formula, based on the words spoken to Adam and Eve after their sin,The biblical text does not have the words \\"remember that\\", nor the vocative noun \\"homo\\" (human being) that is included in the pre-1970 Latin version of the formula. reminds worshippers of their sinfulness and mortality and thus, implicitly, of their need to repent in time.Richard P. Bucher, \\"The History and Meaning of Ash Wednesday\\" The newer formula makes explicit what was only implicit in the old. A deacon burning palm fronds from the previous Palm Sunday for Ash Wednesday Various manners of placing the ashes on worshippers' heads are in use within the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church, the two most common being to use the ashes to make a cross on the forehead and sprinkling the ashes over the crown of the head. Originally, the ashes were strewn over men's heads, but, probably because women had their heads covered in church, were placed on the foreheads of women. In the Catholic Church the manner of imposing ashes depends largely on local custom, since no fixed rule has been laid down. Although the account of √Ülfric of Eynsham shows that in about the year 1000 the ashes were \\"strewn\\" on the head, the marking of the forehead is the method that now prevails in English-speaking countries and is the only one envisaged in the Occasional Offices of the Anglican Church of Papua New Guinea, a publication described as \\"noticeably Anglo-Catholic in character\\". In its ritual of \\"Blessing of Ashes\\", this states that \\"the ashes are blessed at the beginning of the Eucharist; and after they have been blessed they are placed on the forehead of the clergy and people.\\" The Ash Wednesday ritual of the Church of England, Mother Church of the Anglican Communion, contains \\"The Imposition of Ashes\\" in its Ash Wednesday liturgy.Church of England, Lent Material , p. 230 On Ash Wednesday, the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, traditionally takes part in a penitential procession from the Church of Saint Anselm to the Basilica of Santa Sabina, where, in accordance with the custom in Italy and many other countries, ashes are sprinkled on his head, not smudged on his forehead, and he places ashes on the heads of others in the same way. A woman receives a cross of ashes on Ash Wednesday outside an Episcopal church The Anglican ritual, used in Papua New Guinea states that, after the blessing of the ashes, \\"the priest marks his own forehead and then the foreheads of the servers and congregation who come and kneel, or stand, where they normally receive the Blessed Sacrament.\\" The corresponding Catholic ritual in the Roman Missal for celebration within Mass merely states: \\"Then the Priest places ashes on the head of those present who come to him, and says to each one ...\\" Pre-1970 editions had much more elaborate instructions about the order in which the participants were to receive the ashes, but again without any indication of the form of placing the ashes on the head.Tridentine Roman Missal, \\"Feria IV Cinerum\\" The 1969 revision of the Roman Rite inserted into the Mass the solemn ceremony of blessing ashes and placing them on heads, but also explicitly envisaged a similar solemn ceremony outside of Mass.Roman Missal, Ash Wednesday The Book of Blessings contains a simple rite. While the solemn rite would normally be carried out within a church building, the simple rite could appropriately be used almost anywhere. While only a priest or deacon may bless the ashes, laypeople may do the placing of the ashes on a person's head. Even in the solemn rite, lay men or women may assist the priest in distributing the ashes. In addition, laypeople take blessed ashes left over after the collective ceremony and place them on the head of the sick or of others who are unable to attend the blessing. (In 2014, Anglican Liverpool Cathedral likewise offered to impose ashes within the church without a solemn ceremony.) In addition, those who attend such Catholic services, whether in a church or elsewhere, traditionally take blessed ashes home with them to place on the heads of other members of the family, and it is recommended to have envelopes available to facilitate this practice. At home the ashes are then placed with little or no ceremony. Unlike its discipline regarding sacraments, the Catholic Church does not exclude from receiving sacramentals, such as the placing of ashes on the head, those who are not Catholics and perhaps not even baptized. Even those who have been excommunicated and are therefore forbidden to celebrate sacramentals are not forbidden to receive them.Code of Canon Law, canon 1331 ¬ß1 2¬∞ After describing the blessing, the rite of Blessing and Distribution of Ashes (within Mass) states: \\"Then the Priest places ashes on the heads of all those present who come to him.\\" The Catholic Church does not limit distribution of blessed ashes to within church buildings and has suggested the holding of celebrations in shopping centres, nursing homes, and factories.Website of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kildare and Leighlin. Such celebrations presume preparation of an appropriate area and include readings from Scripture (at least one) and prayers, and are somewhat shorter if the ashes are already blessed.Order for the Blessing and Distribution of Ashes The Catholic Church and the Methodist Church say that the ashes should be those of palm branches blessed at the previous year's Palm Sunday service, while a Church of England publication says they \\"may be made\\" from the burnt palm crosses of the previous year. These sources do not speak of adding anything to the ashes other than, for the Catholic liturgy, a sprinkling with holy water when blessing them. An Anglican website speaks of mixing the ashes with a small amount of holy water or olive oil as a fixative. Where ashes are placed on the head by smudging the forehead with a sign of the cross, many Catholics choose to keep the mark visible throughout the day. The churches have not imposed this as an obligatory rule, and the ashes may even be wiped off immediately after receiving them; but some Catholic leaders, such as Lutheran pastor Richard P. Bucher and Catholic bishop Kieran Conry, recommend keeping the ashes on the forehead for the rest of the day as a public profession of the Catholic faith. Morgan Guyton, a Methodist pastor and leader in the Red-Letter Catholic movement, encourages Catholics to wear their ashed cross throughout the day as an exercise of religious freedom. Ashes to Go Anglican priests distribute ashes to passerby in the American city of Boca Raton as part of the Ashes to Go movement Since 2007, some members of major Christian Churches in the United States, including Anglicans, Catholics, Lutherans, and Methodists, have participated in 'Ashes to Go' activities, in which clergy go outside of their churches to public places, such as city centres, sidewalks and railroad stations, to distribute ashes to passers-by, even to people waiting in their cars for a stoplight to change. The Anglican priest Emily Mellott of Calvary Church in Lombard took up the idea and turned it into a movement, stated that the practice was also an act of evangelism. Anglicans and Catholics in parts of the United Kingdom such as Sunderland, are offering Ashes to Go together: Marc Lyden-Smith, the priest of Saint Mary's Church, stated that the ecumenical effort is a \\"tremendous witness in our city, with Catholics and Anglicans working together to start the season of Lent, perhaps reminding those who have fallen away from the Church, or have never been before, that the Catholic faith is alive and active in Sunderland.\\" The Catholic Student Association of Kent State University, based at the University Parish Newman Center, offered ashes to university students who were going through the Student Center of that institution in 2012, and Douglas Clark of St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Church in Statesboro, among others, have participated in Ashes to Go. On Ash Wednesday 2017, Father Paddy Mooney, the priest of St Patrick's Roman Catholic Church in the Irish town of Glenamaddy, set up an Ashes to Go station through which commuters could drive and receive ashes from their car; the parish church also had \\"drive-through prayers during Lent with people submitting requests into a box left in the church grounds without having to leave their car\\". Reverend Trey Hall, pastor of Urban Village United Methodist Church, stated that when his local church offered ashes in Chicago \\"nearly 300 people received ashesincluding two people who were waiting in their car for a stoplight to change.\\" In 2013, churches not only in the United States, but also at least one church each in the United Kingdom, Canada and South Africa, participated in Ashes to Go. Outside of their church building, Saint Stephen Martyr Lutheran Church in Canton offered Ashes to Go for \\"believers whose schedules make it difficult to attend a traditional service\\" in 2016. In the United States itself 34 states and the District of Columbia had at least one church taking part. Most of these churches (parishes) were Episcopal, but there were also several Methodist churches, as well as Presbyterian and Catholic churches. =Commination Office= St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral in Memphis, Tennessee on Ash Wednesday 2011 (the veiled altar cross and purple paraments are customary during Lent) Robin Knowles Wallace states that the traditional Ash Wednesday church service includes Psalm 51 (the Miserere), prayers of confession and the sign of ashes. No single one of the traditional services contains all of these elements. The Anglican church's traditional Ash Wednesday service, titled A Commination, contains the first two elements, but not the third. On the other hand, the Catholic Church's traditional service has the blessing and distribution of ashes but, while prayers of confession and recitation of Psalm 51 (the first psalm at Lauds on all penitential days, including Ash Wednesday) are a part of its general traditional Ash Wednesday liturgy, they are not associated specifically with the rite of blessing the ashes. The rite of blessing has acquired an untraditional weak association with that particular psalm only since 1970, when it was inserted into the celebration of Mass, at which a few verses of Psalm 51 are used as a responsorial psalm. Coincidentally, it was only about the same time that in some areas Anglicanism resumed the rite of ashes. In the mid-16th century, the first Book of Common Prayer removed the ceremony of the ashes from the liturgy of the Church of England and replaced it with what would later be called the Commination Office. In that 1549 edition, the rite was headed: \\"The First Day of Lent: Commonly Called Ash-Wednesday\\". The ashes ceremony was not forbidden, but was not included in the church's official liturgy. Its place was taken by reading biblical curses of God against sinners, to each of which the people were directed to respond with Amen.John Brand, Sir Henry Ellis, James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps, Observations on the Popular Antiquities of Great Britain (Bell & Daldy, 1873), vol. 1, p. 98 \\"Commination\\" in Elizabeth A. Livingstone (editor), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Catholic Church (Oxford University Press 2013 ) The text of the \\"Commination or Denouncing of God's Anger and Judgments against Sinners\\" begins: \\"In the primitive Church there was a godly discipline, that, at the beginning of Lent, such persons as stood convicted of notorious sin were put to open penance, and punished in this world, that their souls might be saved in the day of the Lord; and that others, admonished by their example, might be the more afraid to offend. Instead whereof, until the said discipline may be restored again, (which is much to be wished,) it is thought good that at this time (in the presence of you all) should be read the general sentences of God's cursing against impenitent sinners\\".Full text at the website of the Church of England In line with this, Joseph Hooper Maude wrote that the establishment of The Commination was due to a desire of the reformers \\"to restore the primitive practice of public penance in church\\". He further stated that \\"the sentences of the greater excommunication\\" within The Commination corresponded to those used in the ancient Church. The Anglican Church's Ash Wednesday liturgy, he wrote, also traditionally included the Miserere, which, along with \\"what follows\\" in the rest of the service (lesser Litany, Lord's Prayer, three prayers for pardon and final blessing), \\"was taken from the Sarum services for Ash Wednesday\\". From the Sarum Rite practice in England the service took Psalm 51 and some prayers that in the Sarum Missal accompanied the blessing and distribution of ashes.Sylvia A. Sweeney, An Ecofeminist Perspective on Ash Wednesday and Lent (Peter Lang 2010 ), pp. 107‚Äì110Bernard Reynolds, Handbook to the Book of Common Prayer (–†–∏–ø–æ–ª –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫ ), p. 431 In the Sarum Rite, the Miserere psalm was one of the seven penitential psalms that were recited at the beginning of the ceremony. In the 20th century, the Episcopal Church introduced three prayers from the Sarum Rite and omitted the Commination Office from its liturgy. =Low church ceremonies= In some of the low church traditions, other practices are sometimes added or substituted, as other ways of symbolizing the confession and penitence of the day. For example, in one common variation, small cards are distributed to the congregation on which people are invited to write a sin they wish to confess. These small cards are brought forth to the altar table where they are burned. =Regional customs= In Victorian era, theatres refrained from presenting costumed shows on Ash Wednesday, so they provided other entertainment, as mandated by the Church of England (Anglican Church). In Iceland, children \\"pin small bags of ashes on the back of some unsuspecting person\\", dress up in costumes, and sing songs for candy. Biblical significance of ashes Ashes were used in ancient times to express grief. When Tamar was raped by her half-brother, \\"she sprinkled ashes on her head, tore her robe, and with her face buried in her hands went away crying\\" (). The gesture was also used to express sorrow for sins and faults. In Job , Job says to God: \\"I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\\" The prophet Jeremiah calls for repentance by saying: \\"O daughter of my people, gird on sackcloth, roll in the ashes\\" (Jer 6:26). The prophet Daniel recounted pleading to God: \\"I turned to the Lord God, pleading in earnest prayer, with fasting, sackcloth and ashes\\" (Daniel 9:3). Just prior to the New Testament period, the rebels fighting for Jewish independence, the Maccabees, prepared for battle using ashes: \\"That day they fasted and wore sackcloth; they sprinkled ashes on their heads and tore their clothes\\" (1 Maccabees 3:47; see also 4:39). Examples of the practice among Jews are found in several other books of the Bible, including Numbers , , Jonah , Book of Esther , and Hebrews . Jesus is quoted as speaking of the practice in Matthew and Luke : \\"If the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago (sitting) in sackcloth and ashes.\\" Catholic use of ashes An 1881 Polish painting of a Roman Catholic priest sprinkling ashes on the heads of worshippers, the form prevailing in, for instance, Italy, Spain, and parts of Latin America Catholics continued the practice of using ashes as an external sign of repentance. Tertullian (c. 225) said that confession of sin should be accompanied by lying in sackcloth and ashes.Tertullian, On Repentance, chapter 9 The historian Eusebius (c. 260/265339/340) recounts how a repentant apostate covered himself with ashes when begging Pope Zephyrinus to readmit him to communion. John W. Fenton writes that \\"by the end of the 10th century, it was customary in Western Europe (but not yet in Rome) for all the faithful to receive ashes on the first day of the Lenten fast. In 1091, this custom was then ordered by Pope Urban II at the council of Benevento to be extended to the church in Rome. Not long after that, the name of the day was referred to in the liturgical books as \\"Feria Quarta Cinerum\\" (i.e., Ash Wednesday).\\" The public penance that grave sinners underwent before being admitted to Holy Communion just before Easter lasted throughout Lent, on the first day of which they were sprinkled with ashes and dressed in sackcloth. When, towards the end of the first millennium, the discipline of public penance was dropped, the beginning of Lent, seen as a general penitential season, was marked by sprinkling ashes on the heads of all. This practice is found in the Gregorian Sacramentary of the late 8th century. About two centuries later, √Ülfric of Eynsham, an Anglo-Saxon abbot, wrote of the rite of strewing ashes on heads at the start of Lent.The Lives of the Saints: \\"We read in the books both in the Old Law and in the New that the men who repented of their sins bestrewed themselves with ashes and clothed their bodies with sackcloth. Now let us do this little at the beginning of our Lent that we strew ashes upon our heads to signify that we ought to repent of our sins during the Lenten fast.\\"The Lives of the Saints: https://archive.org/details/aelfricslivesof01aelf. Divine Service The article on Ash Wednesday in the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica states that, after the Protestant Reformation, the ashes ceremony was not forbidden in the Church of England, a statement that may explain the research by Blair Meeks that the Lutheran and Anglican denominations \\"never lapsed in this observance\\". It was even prescribed under King Henry VIII in 1538 and under King Edward VI in 1550, but it fell out of use in many areas after 1600. In 1536, the Ten Articles issued by authority of Henry VIII commended \\"the observance of various rites and ceremonies as good and laudable, such as clerical vestments, sprinkling of holy water, bearing of candles on Candlemas- day, giving of ashes on Ash-Wednesday\\". After Henry's death in January 1547, Thomas Cranmer, within the same year, \\"procured an order from the Council to forbid the carrying of candles on Candlemas-day, and the use of ashes on Ash- Wednesday, and of palms on Palm-Sunday, as superstitious ceremonies\\", an order that was issued only for the ecclesiastical province of Canterbury, of which Cranmer was archbishop.Joseph Towers, British Biography (Goadby 1766), vol. 2, p. 275 John Strype, Memorials of Thomas Cranmer (London, Chiswell 1694), p. 159 John Foxe, John Milner, Ingram Cobbin, Foxe's Book of Martyrs (Knight and Son 1856), p. 500 The Church Cyclop√¶dia states that the \\"English office had adapted the very old Salisbury service for Ash-Wednesday, prefacing it with an address and a recital of the curses of Mount Ebal, and then with an exhortation uses the older service very nearly as it stood.\\" The new Commination Office had no blessing of ashes and therefore, in England as a whole, \\"soon after the Reformation, the use of ashes was discontinued as a 'vain show' and Ash Wednesday then became only a day of marked solemnity, with a memorial of its original character in a reading of the curses denounced against impenitent sinners\\".Robert Chambers, The Book of Days (1862), p. 240 The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, in the 19th century, observed Ash Wednesday: \\"as a day of fasting and humiliation, wherein we are publicly to confess our sins, meekly to implore God's mercy and forgiveness, and humbly to intercede for the continuance of his favour\\".Andrew Fowler, Episcopal Church, An Exposition of the Book of Common Prayer, and Administration of the Sacraments (1805), p. 119 In the 20th century, the Book of Common Prayer provided prayers for the imposition of ashes. An Episcopal priest has an Ashes to Go station for commuters at the Metro-North Railroad in the American state of Connecticut Monte Canfield and Blair Meeks state that after the Protestant Reformation, Anglicans and Lutherans kept the rite of blessing and distributing ashes to the faithful on Ash Wednesday, and that the Protestant denominations that did not keep it encouraged its use \\"during and after the ecumenical era that resulted in the Vatican II proclamations\\". Jack Kingsbury and Russell F. Anderson likewise state that the practice was continued among some Anglicans and Lutherans. On the other hand, Edward Traill Horn wrote: \\"The ceremony of the distribution of the ashes was not retained by the reformers, whether Lutheran, Anglican or Reformed\\", although these denominations honored Ash Wednesday as the first day of Lent.Edward Traill Horn, The Catholic Year (Muhlenberg Press 1957), p. 106 Frank Senn, a liturgical scholar, has been quoted as saying: \\"How and why the use of ashes fell out of Lutheran use is difficult to discern from the sources‚Ä¶ [C]hurch orders don't specifically say not to use ashes; they simply stopped giving direction for blessing and distributing them and eventually the pastors just stopped doing it.\\" As part of the liturgical revival ushered in by the ecumenical movement, the practice was encouraged in Protestant churches, including the Methodist Church.The United Methodist Church website: \\"When did United Methodists start the \\"imposition of ashes\\" on Ash Wednesday?\\" retrieved 1 March 2014  \\"While many think of actions such as the imposition of ashes, signing with the cross, footwashing, and the use of incense as something that only Roman Catholics or high church Episcopalians do, there has been a move among Protestant churches, including United Methodists to recover these more multisensory ways of worship.\\" It has also been adopted by Anabaptist and Reformed churches and some less liturgical denominations.Baptists mark Ash Wednesday Jeff Brumley 13 February 2013  While long associated with Catholic and various liturgical Protestant denominations, its observance has spread in recent years to traditions known more for avoiding liturgical seasons than embracing them. The Eastern Orthodox churches generally do not observe Ash Wednesday, although in recent times, the creation of the Antiochian Western Rite Vicariate has led to the observance of Ash Wednesday among Western Orthodox parishes. In this tradition, ashes \\"may be distributed outside of the mass or any liturgical service\\" although \\"commonly the faithful receive their ashes immediately before the Ash Wednesday mass\\". In Orthodoxy, historically, \\"serious public sinners in the East also donned sackcloth, including those who made the Great Fast a major theme of their entire lives such as hermits and desert-dwellers.\\" Byzantine Rite Catholics, although in the United States use \\"the same Gregorian calendar as the Roman Catholic rite\\", do not practice the distribution of ashes as it is \\"not part of their ancient tradition\\". In the Ambrosian Rite, ashes are blessed and placed on the heads of the faithful not on the day that elsewhere is called Ash Wednesday, but at the end of Mass on the following Sunday, which in that rite inaugurates Lent, with the fast traditionally beginning on Monday, the first weekday of the Ambrosian Lent. Lent Ash Wednesday by Carl Spitzweg: the end of Carnival Ash Wednesday marks the start of a 40-day period which is an allusion to the separation of Jesus in the desert to fast and pray. During this time he was tempted. , , and . While not specifically instituted in the Bible text, the 40-day period of fast and pray is also analogous to the 40 days during which Moses repented and fasted in response to the making of the Golden calf.(Exo. 34:27‚Äì28) (Jews today follow a 40-day period of repenting in preparation for and during the High Holy Days from Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur.) Dates Ash Wednesday is exactly 46 days before Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon. The earliest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 4 February (which is only possible during a common year with Easter on 22 March), which happened in 1598, 1693, 1761 and 1818 and will next occur in 2285. The latest date Ash Wednesday can occur is 10 March (when Easter Day falls on 25 April) which occurred in 1666, 1734, 1886 and 1943 and will next occur in 2038. Since the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, Ash Wednesday has never occurred on Leap Year Day (29 February) but it will do so for the first time in 2096. The only other years of the third millennium that will have Ash Wednesday on 29 February are 2468, 2688, 2840 and 2992.A Perpetual Easter and Passover Calculator: Days Dependent on Easter Sunday. (Ash Wednesday falls on 29 February only if Easter is on 15 April in a leap year starting on a Sunday.) Observing denominations Ash Wednesday is observed by Western Catholicity. Most Latin Rite Roman Catholics observe it, along with certain Protestants like Lutherans, Anglicans, some Reformed churches, Baptists, Nazarenes, Methodists, Evangelicals, and Mennonites. The Moravian Church Wesleyan Church and Metropolitan Community Churches observe Ash Wednesday. Some Independent Catholics, Ecclesia Gnostica and the Community of Christ also observe it. The Eastern Orthodox Church does not, in general, observe Ash Wednesday; instead, Orthodox Great Lent begins on Clean Monday. There are, however, a relatively small number of Orthodox Catholics who follow the Western Rite; these do observe Ash Wednesday, although often on a different day from the previously mentioned denominations, as its date is determined from the Orthodox calculation of Pascha, which may be as much as a month later than the Western observance of Easter.

It commemorates the Washing of the Feet (Maundy) and Last Supper of Jesus Christ with the Apostles, as described in the canonical gospels. It is the fifth day of Holy Week, preceded by Holy Wednesday (Spy Wednesday) and followed by Good Friday. \\"Maundy\\" comes from the Latin word mandatum, or commandment, reflecting Jesus' words \\"I give you a new commandment.\\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/Maundy%20Thursday#etymonline_v_12450 The day comes always between March 19 and April 22, inclusive, and will vary according to whether the Gregorian calendar or the Julian calendar is used. Eastern churches generally use the Julian system. Maundy Thursday initiates the Easter Triduum, the period which commemorates the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus; this period includes Good Friday and Holy Saturday, and ends on the evening of Easter. The Mass of the Lord's Supper or service of worship is normally celebrated in the evening, when Friday begins according to Jewish tradition, as the Last Supper was held on the feast of Passover, according to the three Synoptic Gospels.  Names  Washing of the Feet and the Last Supper, painting of Altar of Siena Cathedral in 14th century Use of the names \\"Maundy Thursday\\", \\"Holy Thursday\\", and others is not evenly distributed. The generally accepted name for the day varies according to geographical area and religious affiliation. Thus, although in England \\"Maundy Thursday\\" is the normal term, the term is less commonly used in Ireland, Scotland or Canada. People may use one term in a religious context and another in the context of the civil calendar of the country in which they live. The Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, which is the mother Church of the Anglican Communion, uses the name \\"Maundy Thursday\\" for this observance. The corresponding publication of the US Episcopal Church, which is another province of the Anglican Communion, also refers to the Thursday before Easter as \\"Maundy Thursday\\".\\"The Calendar of the Church Year\\", p. 17. Throughout the Anglican Communion, the term \\"Holy Thursday\\" is a synonym for Ascension Day. , the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church uses the name \\"Holy Thursday\\" in its official English-language liturgical books. The personal ordinariates in the Catholic Church, which have an Anglican patrimony, retain the traditional English term \\"Maundy Thursday\\", however. An article in the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia used the term \\"Maundy Thursday\\", and some Catholic writers use the same term either primarily, or alternatively. The Latin books use the name Feria quinta in C≈ìna Domini (\\"Thursday of the Supper of the Lord\\"). The Methodist Book of Worship for Church and Home (1965) uses the term \\"Maundy Thursday\\"; the Book of Worship (1992) uses the term \\"Holy Thursday\\", and other official sources of the United Methodist Church use both \\"Maundy Thursday\\" and \\"Holy Thursday\\". Both names are used by other Christian denominations as well, including the Lutheran Church or portions of the Reformed Church. The Presbyterian Church uses the term \\"Maundy Thursday\\" to refer to the holy day in its official sources. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the name for the holy day is, in the Byzantine Rite, \\"Great and Holy Thursday\\" or \\"Holy Thursday\\", and in Western Rite Orthodoxy \\"Maundy Thursday\\", \\"Holy Thursday\\" or both. The Coptic Orthodox Church uses the term \\"Covenant Thursday\\" or \\"Thursday of the Covenant\\". In the Maronite ChurchLiturgical Notes: Thursday of Mysteries and the Syriac Orthodox Church, the name is \\"Thursday of Mysteries\\". \\"Maundy Thursday\\" is the official name of the day in the civil legislation of England and the Philippines. The day has also been known in English as Shere Thursday (also spelled Sheer Thursday), from the word shere (meaning \\"clean\\" or \\"bright\\"). This name might refer to the act of cleaning, or to the fact that churches would switch liturgical colors from the dark tones of Lent, or because it was customary to shear the beard on that day, or for a combination of reasons.\\"The old English name for Maundy Thursday was 'Sheer Thursday', when the penitents obtained absolution, trimmed their hair and beards, and washed in preparation for Easter\\" (Hungarian Saints ). This name has cognates throughout Scandinavia, such as Danish Sk√¶rtorsdag, Swedish Sk√§rtorsdag, Norwegian Skj√¶rtorsdag, Faroese Sk√≠rh√≥sdagur and Sk√≠risdagur, and Icelandic Sk√≠rdagur. = Derivation of the name \\"Maundy\\" = Maundy ceremony in a Church in Wales parish church during a Maundy Thursday service of worship altar of this Methodist church was stripped and the crucifix of this Methodist church was veiled in black for Good Friday (black is the liturgical colour for Good Friday in the United Methodist Church). A wooden cross sits in front of the bare chancel for the veneration of the cross ceremony, which occurs during the United Methodist Good Friday liturgy. Maundy is the name of the Christian rite of footwashing, which traditionally occurs during Maundy Thursday church services. Most scholars agree that the English word maundy in that name for the day is derived through Middle English and Old French mand√©, from the Latin mandatum (also the origin of the English word \\"mandate\\"), the first word of the phrase \\"Mandatum novum do vobis ut diligatis invicem sicut dilexi vos\\" (\\"A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another.\\") This statement by Jesus in the Gospel of by which Jesus explained to the Apostles the significance of his action of washing their feet. The phrase is used as the antiphon sung in the Roman Rite during the Maundy (Ecclesiastical Latin: \\"Mandatum\\") ceremony of the washing of the feet, which may be held during Mass or as a separate event, during which a priest or bishop (representing Christ) ceremonially washes the feet of others, typically 12 persons chosen as a cross-section of the community. In 2016, it was announced that the Roman Missal had been revised to allow women to participate as part of the 12 in the Mandatum; previously, only males partook of the rite. Others theorize that the English name \\"Maundy Thursday\\" arose from \\"maundsor baskets\\" or \\"maundy purses\\" of alms which the king of England distributed to certain poor at Whitehall before attending Mass on that day. Thus, \\"maund\\" is connected to the Latin mendicare, and French mendier, to beg.Philip Schaff: History of the Christian Church, Volume IIIWhy is the Thursday preceding Easter known both as Holy Thursday and Maundy Thursday? A source from the Shepherd of the Springs, Lutheran Church likewise states that, if the name was derived from the Latin mandatum, we would call the day Mandy Thursday, or Mandate Thursday, or even Mandatum Thursday; and that the term \\"Maundy\\" comes in fact from the Latin mendicare, Old French mendier, and English maund, which as a verb means to beg and as a noun refers to a small basket held out by maunders as they maunded.Shepherd of the Springs, Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod Other sources reject this etymology. Services=Western Christianity=Services \\"The Last Supper\\" ‚Äì museum copy of Master Paul's sculpture With Maundy Thursday commemorating the Last Supper, Christian denominations who observe this day universally celebrate the sacrament of Holy Communion, which they teach was instituted by Jesus on this night. The Maundy (washing of the feet) is practiced among many Christian groups on Maundy Thursday, including the Anglican/Protestant Episcopal,Episcopal and the African Methodist Episcopal Church Book of Occasional Services, p. 93 (1994) Armenian, Ethiopian, Lutheran, Methodist, Eastern Catholic, Schwarzenau (German Baptist) Brethren, Church of the Brethren, Mennonite, Presbyterian and Roman Catholic traditions. In the Catholic Church and in some Anglican churches, the Mass of the Lord's Supper begins as usual, but the Gloria is accompanied by the ringing of church bells, which are then silent until the Easter Vigil. After the homily the washing of feet may be performed. The Blessed Sacrament remains exposed, at least in the Catholic Mass, until the service concludes with a procession taking it to the place of reposition. The altar is later stripped bare, as are all other altars in the church except the Altar of Repose. In pre-1970 editions, the Roman Missal envisages this being done ceremonially, to the accompaniment of ,Missale Romanum 1962, p. 161 a practice which continues in Anglican churches of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship. In other Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Church or Methodist Church, the stripping of the altar and other items on the chancel also occurs, as a preparation for the somber Good Friday service. Chrism Mass Chrism Mass in the Lateran Basilica The Chrism Mass is a religious service held in Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism.\\"Chrism Mass 2017\\", The Episcopal Diocese of Tennessee Maundy Thursday is notable for being the day on which the Chrism Mass is celebrated in each diocese. The Chrism Mass is one of the most solemn and important liturgies of the liturgical year. Usually held in the diocesean cathedral, it is generally held on the morning of Maundy Thursday, but may in some dioceses take place on another day during Holy Week.Saunders, William. \\"What is the Chrism Mass?\\", Arlington Catholic Herald, March 23, 2017 It is often the largest annual gathering of clergy and faithful held in most dioceses.Jalbert, Jason. \\"Chrism Mass\\", Diocese of Manchester (New Hampshire) The Mass is a celebration of the institution of the priesthood.\\"What is the Chrism Mass?\\", The Monitor, McAllen, Texas April 11, 2017 During the Mass, those present are called to renew their baptismal promises; priests/ministers and deacons also reaffirm their ministry by renewing the promises made at their ordination.\\"Chrism Mass\\", Cathedral of St. Mary's, Diocese of Lafayette-in- Indiana, April 4, 2017 The Mass takes its name from the blessing of the holy oils used in the sacraments throughout the year, which are then given to priests to take back to their parishes.Chatelain, Kim. \\"Chrism Mass to be celebrated at 10 a.m. at St. Louis Cathedral\\", Times-Picayune, April 11, 2017 The Rite of Reception of the Oils by representatives of the diocesan parishes is a sign of each parish's unity with the Bishop and the diocesan Church.\\"Reception of the Holy Oils\\", USCCB The service is a 1967 restoration of the rite recorded in the early 200s by the historian Hippolytus who writes of a ceremony taking place during the Easter Vigil at which two holy oils were blessed and one was consecrated. In the fifth century, the ceremony of the oils was transferred from the Holy Saturday Vigil to Holy Thursday during a special Mass for that purpose, distinct from the Mass of the Lord's Supper. In the decree renewing this rite Pope Paul VI said:‚ÄúThe Chrism Mass is one of the principal expressions of the fullness of the bishop‚Äôs priesthood and signifies the closeness of the priests with him.‚Äù Blessing Chrism The Holy Oils are: * Chrism ‚Äì used in the sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and Holy Orders, as well as for the consecration of altars and the dedication of churches.\\"Chrism Mass 2017\\", St. James Cathedral, Seattle, April 6, 2017 * the oil of catechumens ‚Äì also used in the sacrament of Baptism, and * the oil of the sick ‚Äì used in the rite of the Anointing of the Sick The oil of the catechumens and chrism are used on the upcoming Holy Saturday at the Easter Vigil, for the baptism and confirmation of those entering the church. While the Oil of the Catechumens and the Oil of the Sick, are simply \\"blessed,\\" the Sacred Chrism is \\"consecrated,\\". Holy chrism is a mixture of olive oil and balsam, an aromatic resin. Balsam is poured into the oil, which gives it a sweet smell intended to remind those who encounter it of the \\"odor of sanctity\\" to which those who are marked with it, are called to strive. The bishop breathes over the vessel containing the chrism, a gesture which symbolizes the Holy Spirit coming down to consecrate this oil, and recalls the actions of Jesus in John 20:22, when he breathed on the apostles and said, \\"Receive the Holy Spirit...\\"\\"Chrism Mass\\", Catholic Review, Archdiocese of Baltimore, March 27, 2008 With respect to Anglicanism, the 1979 Book of Common Prayer (p. 307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. During the Chrism Eucharist, the Bishop will bless the oils used throughout the next year for baptisms and healing. In addition, the Bishop and clergy in attendance will reaffirm their Ordination Vows. =Eastern Christianity=Eastern Orthodoxy Orthodox icon of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, Pskov school of iconography) In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the liturgical colours are brighter, white being common. On this day alone during Holy Week, the fast is relaxed to permit consumption of wine and oil. The primary service of this day is Vespers combined with the Liturgy of St. Basil the Great at which is read the first Passion Gospel (), known as the \\"Gospel of the Testament\\", and many of the normal hymns of the Divine Liturgy are substituted with the following troparion: > Of Thy Mystical Supper, O Son of God, accept me today as a communicant; for > I will not speak of Thy Mystery to Thine enemies, neither will I give Thee a > kiss like Judas. But like the Thief will I confess Thee: Remember me, O > Lord, in Thy Kingdom. When necessary to replenish the sacrament for communing the sick at a time not following a divine liturgy, an additional Lamb (Host) is consecrated on this day, intincted, covered, and left to dry until Holy Saturday when it is divided, completely dried with a candle flame, and the pieces placed in the artophorion. In cathedrals and monasteries the ceremony of the Washing of Feet is normally performed. When there is need to consecrate more chrism, that is performed by patriarchs and other heads of the various autocephalous churches. Reading of the 12th Passion Gospel on Great and Holy Thursday In the evening, after the Liturgy, all of the hangings and vestments are changed to black or some other dark colour, to signify the beginning of the Passion. Anticipating the Matins of Friday morning, the Holy Passion service of the reading of the Twelve Gospels is conducted. In these readings Christ's last instructions to his disciples are presented, as well as the prophecy of the drama of the Cross, Christ's prayer, and his new commandment. The twelve readings are:     Beginning on Holy and Great Thursday, the memorial service for the dead is forbidden until after Thomas Sunday. =Local customs= * In Greek practice, the Mystery of Unction is performed on Great Wednesday as preparation for the reception of Holy Communion on Great Thursday and Pascha, a custom that originated when Greece was under Ottoman control and parish priests, being uneducated, were not permitted to hear confession, so this sacrament, by which sins are believed to be forgiven, came to be performed. * In Greek tradition, a procession is made during the service of the Twelve Passion Gospels. It takes place after the reading of the fifth gospel during the singing of \\"Today He Who Hung\\". During this procession, a large cross with the body of Christ is carried throughout the church while lights are extinguished, bells are slowly tolled, and the faithful prostrate themselves. The cross, with Christ's body hung upon it, is placed in front of the Royal Doors. The icon of Christ on the cross (sometimes with nails affixing it) is struck upon the hands and feet with a stone multiple times, and is then stood up in front of the church, where it is censed. * In some Slavic traditions, a lesser procession is made after the Twelve Passion Gospels immediately prior to the dismissal with an icon of Christ's crucifixion which is placed on the central icon stand, where it is censed by the clergy, and then venerated. Oriental Orthodoxy Oriental Orthodoxy including Coptic (Egyptian) and Ethiopian Orthodoxy which is under papacy of Pope Tawadros II The Copts celebrate Covenant Thursday on 16 April which is 1 week after the Catholics celebrate it. They have praises and vespers every day of week and on Thursday and Saturday they stay praising God and reading about the First Liturgy and Judas‚Äô Betrayal. On Saturday they sing praises for the Entrance of the Messiah in Hades freeing all of the faithful ones including Moses and Abraham etc. Customs and names around the world Bishop Sebouh Chouldjian (Armenian Apostolic Church) washing the feet of children during the Washing of Feet ceremony * If statues and crucifixes have been covered during Passion Time (the last 2 weeks of Lent, at least in the 1962 Catholic missal), the crucifix covers are allowed to be white instead of purple for Holy Thursday. * Maundy Thursday celebrations in the United Kingdom (also called Royal Maundy) today involve the Monarch offering \\"alms\\" to deserving senior citizens - one man and one woman for each year of the sovereign's age. These coins, known as Maundy money or Royal Maundy, are distributed in red and white purses, and is a custom dating back to King Edward I. The red purse contains regular currency and is given in place of food and clothing; the white purse has money in the amount of one penny for each year of the Sovereign's age. Since 1822, rather than ordinary money, the Sovereign gives out Maundy coins,The Royal Mint which are specially minted 1, 2, 3 and 4 penny pieces, and are legal tender. The service at which this takes place rotates around English and Welsh churches, though in 2008 it took place for the first time in Northern Ireland at Armagh Cathedral. Until the death of King James II, the Monarch would also wash the feet of the selected poor people. There is an old sketch, done from life, of Queen Elizabeth I washing people's feet on Maundy Thursday. * The popular German name Gr√ºndonnerstag means either \\"mourning Thursday\\" or \\"green Thursday\\".The word is of medieval origin and may refer to the possible use of green vestments on this day in some regions, or to a custom of eating green salad or pancakes (cf. Deutsches W√∂rterbuch by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm). The name could also derive from Old High German grƒ´nan (\\"mourn\\" or \\"wail\\", cf. Engl. groan), referring to the death of Jesus or the penitents' return to the Eucharist on this day in olden times (K. K√ºppers, \\"Gr√ºndonnerstag\\", In Lexikon des Mittelalters, vol. IV, DTV, Munich, 2003). * In the Czech Republic and Slovakia the day is called Zelen√Ω ƒçtvrtek or Zelen√Ω ≈°tvrtok respectively, again meaning \\"Green Thursday\\", because the typical meals of this day were made of fresh, green vegetables etc. From that day there is no usage of the church bells until Holy Saturday, here called \\"White Saturday\\", because \\"they have flown to Rome\\" (a euphemism), in some regions they are replaced by groups of children walking round their village (or around the church) and making noise with wooden rattles. This is to announce to the people approaching beginning of the liturgy and to call the people to church. * The tradition of silent bells also occurs in Luxembourg: the bells fall silent until Easter, because \\"they have flown to Rome for Confession\\", so children take to the streets, calling people to church with melancholy wooden rattling.Festivals of Western Europe, by Dorothy Gladys Spicer, 1958 * In the Netherlands and Belgium, the day is called Witte Donderdag (White Thursday) referring to the liturgical colour of the day. * In Malta, Holy Thursday is known as ƒ¶amis ix- Xirka (Communion Thursday) and the tradition of visiting seven churches (see below) is called is-seba' visti or is-Sepulkri. * Eastern Slavic cultures traditionally carried out a range of cleansing ceremonies on Maundy Thursday (sometimes known in Russian as \\"Clean Thursday\\" ()). * In Welsh, Maundy Thursday is Dydd Iau Cablyd. * In Sweden Maundy Thursday (sk√§rtorsdagen) is connected to old folklore as the day of the witches. Young children often dress up as witches and knock on doors getting coins or candy for easter eggs. * In Bulgaria Maundy Thursday is called Veliki Chetvurtuk (Great Thursday), and is traditionally the day when people color their easter eggs and perform other household chores geared toward preparing for Razpeti Petuk (Crucifixion Friday), Velika Subota (Great Saturday) and Velikden (Easter Day). * In Kerala State in India, the day is called as Pesaha(‡¥™‡µÜ‡¥∏‡¥π), a Malayalam word derived from the Aramaic or Syriac word for Passover. Maundy Thursday and following Good Friday are observed as statewide public holiday declared by the Government of Kerala, given the high number of Christians in the state. The tradition of consuming Pesaha appam or Indariyappam is customary after special longer Holy Qurbana, which are conducted on the or at midnight till morning in churches of Saint Thomas Christians. On the evening before Good Friday the Pesaha bread is made at home. It is made with unleavened flour and they use a sweet drink call Pesaha Paal made up of coconut milk and jaggery along with this bread. On the Pesaha night the bread is steamed in a new vessel, immediately after rice flour is mixed with water and they pierce it many times with handle of the spoon to let out the steam so that the bread will not rise. This bread is cut by the head of the family and shared among the family members after prayers. In some families, Pesaha Paal a creamy dip made up of jaggery and coconut milk is used along with the Pesaha bread. If the family is in mourning following a death, Pesaha bread is not made at their home, but some of the Saint Thomas Christian neighbours share their bread with them.Sunish George J Alumkalnal, (2013). \\"Pesaha celebration of Nasranis: a sociocultural analysis.\\" Journal of Indo Judaic studies 13, pp. 57‚Äì71 The Saint Thomas Christians diaspora also celebrate this day by having Holy Communion services in the parishes according to their respective liturgies. The tradition of washing feet by priests is practiced in every parish commemorating Jesus washing the feet of his disciples symbolizing humbleness. * In the Philippines, the day is officially known as Huwebes Santo or \\"Maundy Thursday\\" (the term \\"Holy Thursday\\" is rarely used). Most businesses are closed during the Easter Triduum, with shopping malls opening on Black Saturday. Terrestrial television and radio stations either go completely off- air during the Triduum or operate on shorter hours with special programming; cable channels usually retain their normal programming. Newspapers do not publish on Good Friday and Black Saturday. =Public holiday= Christus, by the Lutheran Lucas Cranach the Elder. This woodcut of is from Passionary of the Christ and Antichrist. Maundy Thursday is a public holiday in most countries that were part of the Spanish empire (Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Spain,except in the regions of Catalonia and Valencia Uruguay and Venezuela), countries that were part of the Danish colonial empire (Denmark, Iceland, Norway and United States Virgin Islands), and in the Kerala State of India. Certain German states declare a public holiday for public sector employees. In the UK, civil servants were traditionally granted a half-day holiday (known as \\"privilege leave\\") on this date, but that was abolished after 2012. =Seven Churches Visitation= The tradition of visiting seven churches on Holy Thursday is an ancient practice, probably originating in Rome. and occurs among the faithful in countries around the world. In India, the custom is to visit fourteen churches, one per Station of the Cross. Traditionally, this is performed on Maundy Thursday evening but is more often done on the morning of Good Friday or on any day of Lent. Usually, whole families would participate, customarily fasting for the duration of the rite. It is also undertaken by parish devotional groups. In the Philippines the tradition is called Visita Iglesia (Spanish, \\"church visit\\") - people visit churches to pray, usually reciting the Stations of the Cross. The Stations are often distributed amongst one, seven, or fourteen churches; the custom until the 1970s was to pray all fourteen in each church. It is a chiefly urban custom, as churches are located closer to each other in cities, and supposedly because it originates in visiting the seven churches of Intramuros that stood until the 1945 Bombing of Manila. Of the seven, only Manila Cathedral and San Agust√≠n Church remain in situ following the Second World War. The original purpose of the ritual was to venerate the Blessed Sacrament in the Altar of Repose on Maundy Thursday night, but since no prayers were prescribed (apart from those for the Pope), the Stations of the Cross were recited. Some Filipino liturgists, however, have sought to revive the original vigil before the Blessed Sacrament, and have composed prayers to guide contemporary worshippers. In Singapore, the visiting of churches occurs shortly after the evening Mass of the Last Supper. Prayers at each church consist of seven repetitions of the Lord's Prayer, Ave Maria, and the Gloria Patri. Due to the new trend of late Mass times (sometimes 7 or 8 pm) to allow for more churchgoers, eight churches are the maximum number visited (even in the city area, where these are closer to each other than in outer residential areas) before these close at midnight. A festive atmosphere exists, with the sale of drinks, hot cross buns and other local snacks like the traditional kueh ko chee. Observant Catholics have a 'Last Supper' meal in anticipation of the next day's fast.

Nxg7 causes an \\"explosion\\" in which the capturing knight, captured pawn, and adjacent black rook and bishop are removed from play. Adjacent pawns are unaffected. Atomic chess is a chess variant. Standard rules of chess apply, but all captures result in an \\"explosion\\" through which all surrounding white and black pieces other than pawns are removed from play. Some variations additionally remove rules concerning check such that the king may be able to move into or remain in check. History In 1995 the German Internet Chess Server (GICS) introduced the game, based on rules one of its users collected from friends who played offline. It was soon after incorporated into the Middle East Wild Internet Server (MEWIS) and other smaller servers before being implemented at Chess Live and Internet Chess Club in 2000, Free Internet Chess Server in 2003 and Lichess in 2015. Rules and variations Rules of atomic chess are the same as standard chess with a few important differences concerning capturing, check, and winning conditions. =Capturing= In standard chess, the captured piece is removed from the board and the capturing piece takes its place. In atomic chess, a capture causes an \\"explosion\\" through which both pieces are removed from the board as well as all non-pawn pieces in the eight squares immediately surrounding the capture. Pawns are removed only when capturing, captured directly, or promoted. In case of en passant, the capture is considered to take place on the sixth rank square where the capturing pawn would have landed. Captures that result in the explosion of a player's own king are illegal, and therefore a king can never capture any other piece. =Check= Threats to the king can be direct or indirect. Putting a king in check is a direct attack and is sometimes called \\"atomic check\\". An indirect threat occurs when a player threatens to explode the king by capturing an adjacent piece. In most variations of atomic chess, players must respond to being checked in a similar way they would in traditional chess‚Äîby moving the king out of check, blocking the check, or removing the checking piece‚Äîbut an exception exists when the checked player can win the game by exploding the checking player's king. As the king cannot take another piece, it is possible to move the kings next to each other without a check occurring or to escape check. This possibility is often used by a losing player to defensively position his king next to his opponent's at endgame, hoping for a draw. Depending on the board setup, this strategy is sometimes optimal and the draw can be forced. At other times, a player can counter by forcing a win with a position such that a piece or pawn can be exploded next to their opponent's king without blowing up their own king, or by forcing the opposing king away using their king and the remaining pieces on the board, which typically will result in a loss for the retreating king. The variant of atomic chess played at the Internet Chess Club is one that does not enforce check at all, making legal any move, even one leaving the king to be captured directly in the next move. =Winning conditions= In all variations of atomic chess, a player wins by exploding the king of the opposite color without exploding their own king. This is usually done by capturing a piece on a square adjacent to the opponent's king or putting a queen next to the king which results in checkmate since a king can not take any piece. In variations that require a response to being checked, it is possible to checkmate an opponent to win the game, creating a situation in which a king is directly threatened and cannot make a legal move. This is sometimes called \\"atomic checkmate\\". It is likewise possible for the game to end in stalemate if a king is not directly threatened and no legal moves are possible. When typical rules of check are not enforced, victory is only attained via the explosion of the enemy king. In these variations without check, the king may be forced into check and thus capture through zugzwang. Strategy The first-move advantage enjoyed by White is much greater in this game than in standard chess. Hence, it is a game imbalanced against Black. Although the advantage is significant, no attempts to prove a win for White have been successful. Material sacrifices are more common in atomic chess than in chess. In the opening and middle-game it is common to offer a piece in order to seize an initiative enabled by the newly opened spaces captures create. =Opening= White has the initiative in atomic chess, and many openings begin with a quick attempt to explode Black's d-, e-, or f-pawns in front of the black king. For this reason atomic openings are fraught with traps and Black may have to respond precisely to defend. Several common traps begin with 1.Nf3 followed by Ng5 or Ne5, forcing Black to start with 1..f6 to maintain rough equality. Games between experienced players follow more traditional opening principles such as piece , controlling , and winning . =Endgame= As with atomic opening theory, a small amount of endgame theory and analyses have been published online by strong players. A common scenario in atomic endgames is to have two kings on adjacent squares. As a player cannot intentionally blow up his or her own king, a king can never capture another piece, including another king. Similarly, because a capture affects all adjacent squares, one king cannot be captured directly if it means destruction of the other. Moving one king towards the other is thus a strategy to achieve a draw. The player with the advantage must then maneuver into a position where a non-king piece can be captured that is adjacent to one king but not the other. If there is no piece that can be captured, the player with the advantage can promote two queens and force the opponent into zugzwang and therefore forcing the opponent's king away from his king. Creative use of zugzwang is a common tactic to force a win in these situations. The Internet Chess Club variation of atomic chess ignores check completely, and thus leads to different outcomes in certain situations. For example, a king and rook vs. king endgame that would be a draw under normal circumstances can become a forced win on ICC.

Biography=Childhood in London and Surrey= He was born in Bermondsey, London, in 1912 to Alice and William James Delderfield (c. 1873‚Äì1956). His father worked for a meat wholesaler in Smithfield Market, and was the first Liberal to be elected to Bermondsey Council. William supported women's suffrage and the Boer cause in the Boer War. He was a firm supporter of the temperance movement, and of David Lloyd George until the latter allied himself in government with the Conservative Party. From 1918 to 1923, the family lived at 22 Ashburton Avenue, Addiscombe, near Croydon, Surrey. The Avenue novels were based on Ronald's life in Addiscombe and Shirley Park. Delderfield attended an infant school in Bermondsey, then a \\"seedy and pretentious\\" small private school ‚Äî \\"seventy boys and four underpaid ushers, presided over by a jovial gentleman who wore blue serge\\". He then went to a council school, which he hated, but which provided him with the prototype for Mr. Short in The Avenue. This experience was followed by a grammar school whose dedicated teachers inspired several of his characters. Once the family moved to Devon, Delderfield first attended a co-educational grammar school and, finally, West Buckland School. In his autobiography For My Own Amusement, Delderfield joked that West Buckland could be likened to schools in The Spring Madness of Mr Sermon, The Avenue and A Horseman Riding By, and that it had earned its fees three times over. Again, in For My Own Amusement, Delderfield divided the nation into city and suburb dwellers, rural dwellers, and those who lived in coastal towns. On a family holiday in Swanage when he was young, Delderfield caught scarlet fever and had to spend three months in an isolation hospital. =Residence in East Devon= In 1923, Delderfield's father and a neighbour in Bermondsey bought the Exmouth Chronicle, a local newspaper in Exmouth, and William became the editor. In 1929, Delderfield joined the staff of the paper and later succeeded his father as editor. In For My Own Amusement, he describes his work‚Äîattending Magistrates' Courts and Council meetings, covering amateur dramatics and other events, visiting the bereaved to write local obituaries, even cycling after the fire engine to see if there was a story, as well as relying on a large number of local correspondents. His experiences during this period were clearly mirrored in the romantic novel Diana. In 1962 he had a house, 'Dove Cottage' (now 'Gazebo'), built on Peak Hill in Sidmouth. Delderfield's first published play was produced at Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1936; the Birmingham Post wrote \\"more please, Mr Delderfield\\". One of his plays, Worm's Eye View, had a run at the Whitehall Theatre in London, and was filmed in 1951 with Diana Dors. Following service in the RAF during World War II, he resumed his literary career, while also running an antiques business near Budleigh Salterton, Devon. Having begun with drama, Delderfield decided to switch to writing novels in the 1950s. His first novel, Seven Men of Gascony, a tale of French soldiers in the Napoleonic Wars, was published in 1949 by Werner Laurie. =Autobiography= In For My Own Amusement (1972), Delderfield discusses the inspiration for the storylines and tells in anecdotes the origin of several of his characters. He believed that authors draw inspiration from the scenes of their youth, pointing out that Charles Dickens' characters nearly always used the stagecoach, when he was writing in the age of the train. Delderfield calls his sources \\"character farms\\", the main ones being his time in Addiscombe, schooldays, and his time at the Exmouth Chronicle. Of The Avenue and A Horseman Riding By he said, \\"I set out to tell a straightforward story of a group of undistinguished British people‚Äîthe only kind of people I really know.\\" Delderfield pointed out in this autobiography that he had been criticized for his very conventional views of women's social roles. =Death= Delderfield died at his home in Sidmouth, then called Dove Cottage, of lung cancer, survived by his widow, the former May Evans, whom he married in 1936. They had a son and a daughter.R. F. Delderfield, Writer, Dies; Chronicler of English Life. .New York Times, 27 June 1972 A brother, Eric (1909‚Äì95) survived him and wrote several books on the history of England's West Country. Early 20th century social history as a subject of his writing Several of Delderfield's historical novels and series involve young men who return from war and lead lives in England that allow the author to portray the sweep of English history and delve deeply into social history from the Edwardian era to the early 1960s. = Examples = * David Powlett-Jones of To Serve Them All My Days begins his teaching of history at a rural public school shortly after being released from a shell- shock ward in 1918. That novel examines the changes in private education and the development of the Labour political movement between the world wars. * Adam Swann of the God is an Englishman series is a veteran of the British Army in India who forms a transport business in the mid-19th century. The series explores the economic history of England from the 1860s to the outbreak of the First World War. * In the A Horseman Riding By trilogy, Paul Craddock, also an ex-soldier, becomes a rural landlord in Delderfield's own Devon in the early 20th century. * The two-volume work The Avenue, which follows the residents of a middle-class suburban road over a few decades, begins shortly after the end of World War I with the return of one resident, who finds that his wife has died in the Spanish flu epidemic and left him with several children to care for.  Other works  Delderfield also published non-fiction books on Napoleonic history, historical novels involving the Napoleonic Wars, and some isolated novels set in more contemporary periods. His prose style tends to be straightforward and readable, lacking in any influence from post-modernist fiction, and his social attitudes are fairly traditional, though his politics, as expressed via his characters, are a mixture of progressive and free market. In general, Delderfield's novels celebrate English history, humanity, and liberalism while demonstrating little patience with entrenched class differences and snobbery yet also sometimes advocating individualism, self- reliance, and other traditional Victorian values. Delderfield wrote The Adventures of Ben Gunn (1956) which follows Ben Gunn from sexton's son to pirate and is narrated by Jim Hawkins in Gunn's words. It describes the life of Ben Gunn from the events which led him to leave Devon, and eventually to his presence on Treasure Island and involvement in the story told by Stevenson, and follows up with a brief summary of Ben Gunn's life afterwards.

Early life Princess Ingeborg's birthplace, Charlottenlund PalacePrincess Ingeborg was born on 2 August 1878 at Charlottenlund Palace north of Copenhagen as the second daughter and fifth child of Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark, the eldest son of King Christian IX. Her mother was Princess Louise of Sweden, the only surviving child of King Charles XV of Sweden and IV of Norway. Marriage Ingeborg, Duchess of V√§sterg√∂tland in mourning, 1900s In May 1897, Princess Ingeborg was engaged to Prince Carl of Sweden, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland. Prince Carl was the third son of King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway and Sophia of Nassau. They were, therefore, first cousins once-removed. They married on 27 August 1897 in the chapel at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen and spent their honeymoon in Germany. The couple had four children: # Princess Margaretha of Sweden, later Princess Axel of Denmark (1899‚Äì1977). # Princess M√§rtha of Sweden, later Crown Princess of Norway (1901‚Äì1954). # Princess Astrid of Sweden, later Queen of the Belgians (1905‚Äì1935). # Prince Carl Bernadotte, known as Carl Jr., later Prince Bernadotte, a Belgian title (1911‚Äì2003).

Family life Princess Ingeborg and her daughters. (1910) She lived a harmonious family life, and the family was known as \\"The happy family\\". The children were given a simple upbringing, and expected to learn household tasks: they were, for example, given a real stove in their play cottage, on which they cooked real food. She and Carl lived an informal and intimate family life with their children. Ingeborg was admired for her handling of the economic difficulties experienced when a bank they invested in crashed in 1922 and they had to sell their home. She was portrayed as a symbol of a wife and mother in many magazines and was for many years the most popular member of the royal house. In 1905, the Norwegian government discussed making them king and queen of Norway, but Carl declined the offer. Instead, her brother was elected monarch of Norway. Ingeborg's kinship to the Scandinavian dynasties helped bring the three royal houses together again after tension created due to Norway's 1905 secession. Politically, Ingeborg had democratic and liberal sympathies and disliked the conservatives, views she expressed during the governmental crisis in 1918. She detested the conservative Hammarsk√∂ljd cabinet and the 1914 policy, criticized the conservative press and viewed the resignation of the Liberal-Social Democratic cabinet of 1918 as a disaster, reportedly commented it with the words: \\"It must not happen! No no no!\\" During World War II in 1940‚Äì45, she demonstrated publicly against Nazi Germany by blocking the window of her house which faced the German embassy in Stockholm. Princess Ingeborg has the distinction of being the grandmother of three European monarchs: King Harald V of Norway, King Baudouin of Belgium and King Albert II of Belgium; and the great-grandmother of two: Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and King Philippe of Belgium. She is also grandaunt of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and great-grandaunt of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

Plants with bark include trees, woody vines, and shrubs. Bark refers to all the tissues outside the vascular cambium and is a nontechnical term. It overlays the wood and consists of the inner bark and the outer bark. The inner bark, which in older stems is living tissue, includes the innermost layer of the periderm. The outer bark on older stems includes the dead tissue on the surface of the stems, along with parts of the outermost periderm and all the tissues on the outer side of the periderm. The outer bark on trees which lies external to the living periderm is also called the rhytidome. Products derived from bark include: bark shingle siding and wall coverings, spices and other flavorings, tanbark for tannin, resin, latex, medicines, poisons, various hallucinogenic chemicals and cork. Bark has been used to make cloth, canoes, and ropes and used as a surface for paintings and map making.Taylor, Luke. 1996. Seeing the Inside: Bark Painting in Western Arnhem Land. Oxford Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology. Oxford: Clarendon Press. A number of plants are also grown for their attractive or interesting bark colorations and surface textures or their bark is used as landscape mulch.Sandved, Kjell Bloch, Ghillean T. Prance, and Anne E. Prance. 1993. Bark: the Formation, Characteristics, and Uses of Bark around the World. Portland, Or: Timber Press.Vaucher, Hugues, and James E. Eckenwalder. 2003. Tree Bark: a Color Guide. Portland: Timber Botanic description What is commonly called bark includes a number of different tissues. Cork is an external, secondary tissue that is impermeable to water and gases, and is also called the phellem. The cork is produced by the cork cambium which is a layer of meristematically active cells which serve as a lateral meristem for the periderm. The cork cambium, which is also called the phellogen, is normally only one cell layer thick and it divides periclinally to the outside producing cork. The phelloderm, which is not always present in all barks, is a layer of cells formed by and interior to the cork cambium. Together, the phellem (cork), phellogen (cork cambium) and phelloderm constitute the periderm.Dickison, WC. 2000. Integrative Plant Anatomy, Academic Press, San Diego, 186‚Äì195. Cork cell walls contain suberin, a waxy substance which protects the stem against water loss, the invasion of insects into the stem, and prevents infections by bacteria and fungal spores. The cambium tissues, i.e., the cork cambium and the vascular cambium, are the only parts of a woody stem where cell division occurs; undifferentiated cells in the vascular cambium divide rapidly to produce secondary xylem to the inside and secondary phloem to the outside. Phloem is a nutrient-conducting tissue composed of sieve tubes or sieve cells mixed with parenchyma and fibers. The cortex is the primary tissue of stems and roots. In stems the cortex is between the epidermis layer and the phloem, in roots the inner layer is not phloem but the pericycle. Tree cross section diagram From the outside to the inside of a mature woody stem, the layers include: # Bark ## Periderm ### Cork (phellem or suber), includes the rhytidome ### Cork cambium (phellogen) ### Phelloderm ## Cortex ## Phloem # Vascular cambium # Wood (xylem) ## Sapwood (alburnum) ## Heartwood (duramen) # Pith (medulla) Tecp√°n, Guatemala. In young stems, which lack what is commonly called bark, the tissues are, from the outside to the inside: # Epidermis, which may be replaced by periderm # Cortex # Primary and secondary phloem # Vascular cambium # Secondary and primary xylem. As the stem ages and grows, changes occur that transform the surface of the stem into the bark. The epidermis is a layer of cells that cover the plant body, including the stems, leaves, flowers and fruits, that protects the plant from the outside world. In old stems the epidermal layer, cortex, and primary phloem become separated from the inner tissues by thicker formations of cork. Due to the thickening cork layer these cells die because they do not receive water and nutrients. This dead layer is the rough corky bark that forms around tree trunks and other stems. Periderm Often a secondary covering called the periderm forms on small woody stems and many non-woody plants, which is composed of cork (phellem), the cork cambium (phellogen), and the phelloderm. The periderm forms from the phellogen which serves as a lateral meristem. The periderm replaces the epidermis, and acts as a protective covering like the epidermis. Mature phellem cells have suberin in their walls to protect the stem from desiccation and pathogen attack. Older phellem cells are dead, as is the case with woody stems. The skin on the potato tuber (which is an underground stem) constitutes the cork of the periderm. In woody plants the epidermis of newly grown stems is replaced by the periderm later in the year. As the stems grow a layer of cells form under the epidermis, called the cork cambium, these cells produce cork cells that turn into cork. A limited number of cell layers may form interior to the cork cambium, called the phelloderm. As the stem grows, the cork cambium produces new layers of cork which are impermeable to gases and water and the cells outside the periderm, namely the epidermis, cortex and older secondary phloem die. Within the periderm are lenticels, which form during the production of the first periderm layer. Since there are living cells within the cambium layers that need to exchange gases during metabolism, these lenticels, because they have numerous intercellular spaces, allow gaseous exchange with the outside atmosphere. As the bark develops, new lenticels are formed within the cracks of the cork layers. Rhytidome Living tree bark enveloping barbed wire The rhytidome is the most familiar part of bark, being the outer layer that covers the trunks of trees. It is composed mostly of dead cells and is produced by the formation of multiple layers of suberized periderm, cortical and phloem tissue. The rhytidome is especially well developed in older stems and roots of trees. In shrubs, older bark is quickly exfoliated and thick rhytidome accumulates. It is generally thickest and most distinctive at the trunk or bole (the area from the ground to where the main branching starts) of the tree. Chemical composition Bark tissues make up by weight between 10‚Äì20% of woody vascular plants and consists of various biopolymers, tannins, lignin, suberin, suberan and polysaccharides. Up to 40% of the bark tissue is made of lignin, which forms an important part of a plant, providing structural support by crosslinking between different polysaccharides, such as cellulose. Condensed tannin, which is in fairly high concentration in bark tissue, is thought to inhibit decomposition. It could be due to this factor that the degradation of lignin is far less pronounced in bark tissue than it is in wood. It has been proposed that, in the cork layer (the phellogen), suberin acts as a barrier to microbial degradation and so protects the internal structure of the plant. Analysis of the lignin in bark wall during decay by the white-rot fungi Lentinula edodes (Shiitake mushroom) using 13C NMR revealed that the lignin polymers contained more Guaiacyl lignin units than Syringyl units compared to the interior of the plant. Guaiacyl units are less susceptible to degradation as, compared to syringyl, they contain fewer aryl-aryl bonds, can form a condensed lignin structure and have a lower redox potential. This could mean that the concentration and type of lignin units could provide additional resistance to fungal decay for plants protected by bark. Uses Bark chips Cork, sometimes confused with bark in colloquial speech, is the outermost layer of a woody stem, derived from the cork cambium. It serves as protection against damage from parasites, herbivorous animals and diseases, as well as dehydration and fire. Cork can contain antiseptics like tannins, that protect against fungal and bacterial attacks that would cause decay. Backpack made of birch bark. Museum by Lake Baikal, Russia Bark of pine was used as emergency food in Finland during famine, last time during and after civil war in 1918. In some plants, the bark is substantially thicker, providing further protection and giving the bark a characteristically distinctive structure with deep ridges. In the cork oak (Quercus suber) the bark is thick enough to be harvested as a cork product without killing the tree; in this species the bark may get very thick (e.g. more than 20 cm has been reported). Some barks can be removed in long sheets; the smooth surfaced bark of birch trees has been used as a covering in the making of canoes, as the drainage layer in roofs, for shoes, backpacks etc. The most famous example of using birch bark for canoes is the birch canoes of North America.Adney, Tappan, and Howard Irving Chapelle. 1964. The Bark Canoes and Skin Boats of North America. Washington: Smithsonian Institution. The inner bark (phloem) of some trees is edible; in Scandinavia, bark bread is made from rye to which the toasted and ground innermost layer of bark of scots pine or birch is added. The Sami people of far northern Europe used large sheets of Pinus sylvestris bark that were removed in the spring, prepared and stored for use as a staple food resource and the inner bark was eaten fresh, dried or roasted. = Mechanical bark processing = Bark contains strong fibres known as bast, and there is a long tradition in northern Europe of using bark from coppiced young branches of the small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) to produce cordage and rope, used for example in the rigging of Viking Age longships. Among the commercial products made from bark are cork, cinnamon, quinineDuran-Reynals, Marie Louise de Ayala. 1946. The Fever Bark Tree; the Pageant of Quinine. Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday.

Murray. and aspirin (from the bark of willow trees). The bark of some trees notably oak (Quercus robur) is a source of tannic acid, which is used in tanning. Bark chips generated as a by-product of lumber production are often used in bark mulch in western North America. Bark is important to the horticultural industry since in shredded form it is used for plants that do not thrive in ordinary soil, such as epiphytes. = Bark chip extraction = Wood bark contains lignin; when it is pyrolyzed (subjected to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen), it yields a liquid bio-oil product rich in natural phenol derivatives. The phenol derivatives are isolated and recovered for application as a replacement for fossil-based phenols in phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins used in Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and plywood. Bark removal Cut logs are inflamed either just before cutting or before curing. Such logs and even trunks and branches found in their natural state of decay in forests, where the bark has fallen off, are said to be decorticated. A number of living organisms live in or on bark, including insects,Lieutier, Fran√ßois. 2004. Bark and Wood Boring Insects in Living Trees in Europe, a Synthesis. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers. fungi and other plants like mosses, algae and other vascular plants. Many of these organisms are pathogens or parasites but some also have symbiotic relationships.  Bark repair  The degree to which trees are able to repair gross physical damage to their bark is very variable. Some are able to produce a callus growth which heals over the wound rapidly, but leaves a clear scar, whilst others such as oaks do not produce an extensive callus repair. Frost crack and sun scald are examples of damage found on tree bark which trees can repair to a degree, depending on the severity.

He was the founder and first ruling member of the short-lived Doukid dynasty. During his reign, the Normans took over much of the remaining Byzantine territories in Italy while in the Balkans the Hungarians occupied Belgrade. He also suffered defeats by the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan. Reign Constantine Doukas was the son of Andronikos Doukas, a Paphlagonian Greek nobleman who may have served as governor of the theme of Moesia. Addicted to endless debates about philosophy and theology, Constantine gained influence after he married, as his second wife, Eudokia Makrembolitissa, a niece of Patriarch Michael Keroularios.Kazhdan 1991, p. 504 In 1057, Constantine supported the usurpation of Isaac I Komnenos, gradually siding with the court bureaucracy against the new emperor's reforms. In spite of this tacit opposition, Constantine was chosen as successor by the ailing Isaac in November 1059, under the influence of Michael Psellos.Norwich 1993, p. 337 Isaac abdicated, and on 24 November 1059, Constantine X Doukas was crowned emperor.Finlay 1854, p. 15 The new emperor quickly associated two of his young sons in power, Michael VII Doukas and Konstantios Doukas, appointed his brother John Doukas as kaisar (Caesar), and embarked on a policy favorable to the interests of the court bureaucracy and the church. Severely undercutting the training and financial support for the armed forces, Constantine X fatally weakened Byzantine defences by disbanding the Armenian local militia of 50,000 men at a crucial point of time, coinciding with the westward advance of the Seljuk Turks and their Turcoman allies.Norwich 1993, p. 341 Undoing many of the necessary reforms of Isaac I Komnenos, he bloated the military bureaucracy with highly paid court officials and crowded the Senate with his supporters.Finlay 1854, p. 17 His decisions to replace standing soldiers with mercenariesNorwich 1993, p. 339 and leaving the frontier fortifications unrepaired led Constantine to become naturally unpopular with the supporters of Isaac within the military aristocracy, who attempted to assassinate him in 1061. He also became unpopular with the general population after he raised taxes to try to pay the army. At the very start of his reign, the Normans under Robert Guiscard completed the conquest of Byzantine Calabria, but Constantine showed a resurgent interest in retaining Apulia. He appointed at least two catepans of Italy (Marules and Sirianus) and sent reinforcements on two further occasions (under \\"Miriarcha\\" and Michael Maurex). He also suffered invasions by Alp Arslan in Asia Minor in 1064, resulting in the loss of the Armenian capital,Norwich 1993, p. 342 and by the Oghuz Turks in the Balkans in 1065,Finlay 1854, p. 27 while Belgrade was lost to the Hungarians.Finlay 1854, p. 24 Already old and unhealthy when he came to power, Constantine died on 22 May 1067. His final act was to demand that only his sons succeed him, forcing his wife Eudokia Makrembolitissa to take a vow not to remarry.Norwich 1993, p. 343 Family By his first wife, a daughter of Constantine Dalassenos, Constantine X Doukas had no known children. By his second wife, Eudokia Makrembolitissa, he had the following issue: * Michael VII Doukas, who succeeded as emperor. * Andronikos Doukas, co-emperor from 1068 to 1078. * Konstantios Doukas, co-emperor from c. 1060 to 1078, died 1081. * Anna Doukaina, a nun * Theodora Anna Doukaina, who married Domenico Selvo, Doge of Venice. * Zoe Doukaina, who married Adrianos Komnenos, a brother of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos.

Silt may occur as a soil (often mixed with sand or clay) or as sediment mixed in suspension with water (also known as a suspended load) and soil in a body of water such as a river. It may also exist as soil deposited at the bottom of a water body, like mudflows from landslides. Silt has a moderate specific area with a typically non-sticky, plastic feel. Silt usually has a floury feel when dry, and a slippery feel when wet. Silt can be visually observed with a hand lens, exhibiting a sparkly appearance. It also can be felt by the tongue as granular when placed on the front teeth (even when mixed with clay particles).  Sources  Silt is created by a variety of physical processes capable of splitting the generally sand-sized quartz crystals of primary rocks by exploiting deficiencies in their lattice. These involve chemical weathering of rock and regolith, and a number of physical weathering processes such as frost shattering and haloclasty. The main process is abrasion through transport, including fluvial comminution, aeolian attrition and glacial grinding. It is in semi-arid environments that substantial quantities of silt are produced. Silt is sometimes known as \\"rock flour\\" or \\"stone dust\\", especially when produced by glacial action. Mineralogically, silt is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar. Sedimentary rock composed mainly of silt is known as siltstone. Liquefaction created by a strong earthquake is silt suspended in water that is hydrodynamically forced up from below ground level.  Grain size criteria  In the Udden‚ÄìWentworth scale (due to Krumbein), silt particles range between 0.0039 and 0.0625 mm, larger than clay but smaller than sand particles. ISO 14688 grades silts between 0.002 mm and 0.063 mm (sub-divided up into three grades fine, medium and coarse 0.002 mm to 0.006 mm to 0.020 mm to 0.063 mm). In actuality, silt is chemically distinct from clay, and unlike clay, grains of silt are approximately the same size in all dimensions; furthermore, their size ranges overlap. Clays are formed from thin plate-shaped particles held together by electrostatic forces, so present a cohesion. Pure silts are not cohesive. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Soil Texture Classification system, the sand‚Äìsilt distinction is made at the 0.05 mm particle size. The USDA system has been adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and the AASHTO Soil Classification system, the sand‚Äìsilt distinction is made at the 0.075 mm particle size (i.e., material passing the #200 sieve). Silts and clays are distinguished mechanically by their plasticity.  Environmental impacts  A silted lake located in Eichhorst, Germany Silt is easily transported in water or other liquid and is fine enough to be carried long distances by air in the form of dust. Thick deposits of silty material resulting from deposition by aeolian processes are often called loess. Silt and clay contribute to turbidity in water. Silt is transported by streams or by water currents in the ocean. When silt appears as a pollutant in water the phenomenon is known as siltation. Silt, deposited by annual floods along the Nile River, created the rich, fertile soil that sustained the Ancient Egyptian civilization. Silt deposited by the Mississippi River throughout the 20th century has decreased due to a system of levees, contributing to the disappearance of protective wetlands and barrier islands in the delta region surrounding New Orleans. In southeast Bangladesh, in the Noakhali district, cross dams were built in the 1960s whereby silt gradually started forming new land called \\"chars\\". The district of Noakhali has gained more than of land in the past 50 years. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began to help develop older chars in the late 1970s, and the effort has since become a multi-agency operation building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some to 21,000 families. A main source of silt in urban rivers is disturbance of soil by construction activity. A main source in rural rivers is erosion from plowing of farm fields, clearcutting or slash and burn treatment of forests.  Culture  The fertile black silt of the Nile river's banks is a symbol of rebirth, associated with the Egyptian god Anubis.

He has served on the faculties of Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is currently a Professor of the Practice of the Humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was one of the first people at MIT to have a joint faculty position in both the sciences and the humanities. In his thinking and writing, Lightman is known for exploring the intersection of the sciences and the humanities, especially the dialogue between science, philosophy, religion, and spirituality. He is the author of the international bestseller Einstein's Dreams. Einstein's Dreams has been translated into more than 30 languages and adapted into dozens of independent theatrical and musical productions worldwide, most recently (2019) at the off Broadway Prospect Theater in New York. It is one of the most widely used \\"common books\\" on college campuses. Lightman's novel The Diagnosis was a finalist for the National Book Award. He is also the founder of Harpswell, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance a new generation of women leaders in Southeast Asia. Lightman has received six honorary doctoral degrees. Early life and education Alan Lightman was born and grew up in Memphis, Tennessee. His father Richard Lightman was a movie theater owner and played a major role in desegregating movie theaters in the South in 1962. His mother Jeanne Garretson was a dance teacher and Braille typist. Early on, Lightman demonstrated an interest in both the sciences and the arts by winning city and state science fairs as well as being a state winner of the National Council of Teachers of English award. He graduated from White Station High School. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa with an A.B. in physics from Princeton University in 1970 after completing a senior thesis, titled \\"Design and construction of a gas scintillation detector capable of time-of- flight measurements of fission isomer decays\\", under the supervision of Robert Naumann. He then received a Ph.D. in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1974 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \\"I. Time- dependent accretion disks around compact objects. II. Theoretical frameworks for analyzing and testing gravitation theories\\", under the supervision of Kip S. Thorne. Career Lightman was a postdoctoral fellow in astrophysics at Cornell University (1974-1976); an assistant professor at Harvard University (1976-1979); a senior research scientist at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (1979-1989); and then a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (1989 - ). During this period he began publishing poetry in small magazines and eventually essays in Science 80, the Smithsonian, the New Yorker, and other magazines. At MIT, in the mid 1990s Lightman chaired the committee that established the communication requirement for all undergraduates. In 2005, he was a cofounder of the Catalyst Collaborative at MIT, a partnership between MIT and Central Square Theater, in Cambridge, that sponsors plays involving science and the culture of science. In the same year, Lightman cofounded the graduate program in science writing at MIT. Scientific work In his scientific work, Lightman has made contributions to the theory of astrophysical processes under extreme temperatures and densities. In particular, his research has focused on relativistic gravitation theory, the structure and behavior of accretion disks, stellar dynamics, radiative processes, and relativistic plasmas. Some of his significant achievements are his discovery, with Douglas Eardley, of a structural instability in orbiting disks of matter, called accretion disks, that form around massive condensed objects such as black holes, with wide application in astronomy;Astrophysical Journal Letters, vol. 187, pg. L1 (1974) his proof, with David L. Lee, that all gravitation theories obeying the Weak Equivalence Principle (the experimentally verified fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field) must be metric theories of gravity, that is, must describe gravity as a geometrical warping of time and space;Physical Review D, vol. 8, pg. 364 (1973) his calculations, with Stuart L. Shapiro, of the distribution of stars around a massive black hole and the rate of destruction of those stars by the hole;Astrophysical Journal, vol. 211, pg. 244 (1977) his discovery, independently of Roland Svensson of Sweden, of the negative heat behavior of optically thin, hot thermal plasmas dominated by electron-positron pairs, that is, the result that adding energy to thin hot gases causes their temperature to decrease rather than increase;Astrophysical Journal, vol. 253, pg. 842 (1982) and his work on unusual radiation processes, such as unsaturated inverse Compton scattering, in thermal media, also with wide application in astrophysics.Nature, vol. 262, pg. 196 (1976) His research articles have appeared in Physical Review, The Astrophysical Journal, Reviews of Modern Physics, Nature, and other journals. In 1990 he chaired the science panel of the National Academy of Sciences Astronomy and Astrophysics Survey Committee. He is a past chair of the High Energy Division of the American Astronomical Society.

There he met a Cambodian lawyer named Veasna Chea who told him that when she had been going to university in Phnom Penh in the mid 1990s, she and a handful of female students lived underneath the university building, in the two-meter crawl space between the bottom of the building and the mud, because there was no housing for female university students. Lightman and Chea together conceived the idea of a dormitory for female university students in Phnom Penh. That first facility was completed in 2006, the first dormitory for college women in the country. During this work, Lightman founded Harpswell, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to advance a new generation of women leaders in Southeast Asia. Harpswell now operates two dormitory and leadership centers in Phnom Penh. In addition to providing free housing, food, and medical care, the facility gives outstanding young women a rigorous in-house program in leadership skills and critical thinking. The in-house program includes English instruction, computer literacy, debate, analytical writing, comparative genocide studies, strategies for civic engagement, leadership training, and discussion and analysis of national and international events. As of Fall 2019, the Cambodian program has about 180 graduates and about 76 current students. Harpswell graduates are advancing into leadership positions as project managers at NGOs, lawyers, businesswomen, journalists, engineers, health care workers, teachers and professors, government staff, and bankers. In 2017, Harpswell launched a new program in leadership for young professional women from all ten countries of Southeast Asia: Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, and Brunei, plus Nepal. The Harpswell-ASEAN Program in Women's Leadership consists of an intense, two week summer program in Penang Malaysia, with lectures and workshops in critical thinking, civic engagement, Southeast Asian geography and society, technology and communication, and gender issues. The program has a total of 25 participants each year, who are flown to Penang from their respective countries.

G. Wodehouse's stories. Biography=Early life= Price was born in Ruscombe in Berkshire, the son of Brigadier-General Thomas Rose Caradoc Price (1875‚Äì1949) CMG DSOThe Times, 25 October 1949, p. 1 (who was a great-grandson of Sir Rose Price, 1st Baronet and, through his mother, a descendant of the Baillie baronets of Polkemmet, near Whitburn, West Lothian)Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th edition, vol. 3, ed. Charles Mosley, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 2003, p. 2315 and his wife Dorothy, n√©e Verey, daughter of Sir Henry Verey,Gaye, p. 1076 He attended Copthorne Prep School, Radley College and Worcester College, Oxford. He studied acting at the Embassy Theatre School of Acting. =Stage actor= Price made his first appearance on stage at the Croydon Repertory Theatre in June 1937, followed by a London debut at the Queen's Theatre on 6 September 1937 in Richard II. He served in the Royal Artillery from March 1940 to June 1942 during the Second World War, but returned to acting after being invalided out, appearing with No√´l Coward in This Happy Breed and Present Laughter and later as Charles Condomine in Blithe Spirit, which he later named in Who's Who in the Theatre as one of his two favourite parts along with the title role in Andr√© Obey's Noah.Gaye, p. 1076 =Film career= Price's first film role was in A Canterbury Tale (1944). He impressed Gainsborough Pictures, which put him under contract. According to Brian MacFarlane, Price was \\"mercilessly used by Gainsborough [Pictures] in one unsuitable role after another\\" in this period.Brian MacFarlane \\"Price, Dennis (1915-1973)\\", BFI screenonline, reprinted from MacFarlane (ed.) Encyclopaedia of British Cinema, London: Methuen/BFI, 2003, p.534 He was given a support role in A Place of One's Own (1945) starring James Mason. British National borrowed him for The Echo Murders (1946), a Sexton Blake film; he was then fourth-billed as the villain in a Gainsborough melodrama, Caravan (1946) with Stewart Granger and Jean Kent, playing the type of villainous part that had made James Mason a star (and that Mason was no longer interested in playing). It was a huge success. Price was a villain again in Gainsborough's The Magic Bow (1946) with Granger and Kent. Two Cities Films used him in one of its melodramas, Hungry Hill (1947). Gainsborough used him in villainous roles in Dear Murderer, Holiday Camp, Jassy and Master of Bankdam (all 1947). He made two for Bernard Knowles, supporting Margaret Lockwood in The White Unicorn and a comedy, Easy Money (both 1948). He followed this with a thriller, Snowbound, and a crime melodrama Good-Time Girl (both 1948). In 1948, British exhibitors voted Price the tenth-most popular British actor at the box office.\\"Britten's 'Rape of Lucretia': New York Divided\\", The Manchester Guardian (1901‚Äì1959) [Manchester (UK)] 31 Dec 1948, p.8 =Stardom= He was promoted to starring roles. He was given the title role in The Bad Lord Byron (1949); this was a huge flop at the box office, and helped kill off the Gainsborough melodrama. Much more successful, both at the box-office and among critics was Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), for Ealing Films; he played the suave serial murderer Louis Mazzini with Alec Guinness as the eight victims. Price was in a wartime drama, The Lost People (1949). In the same year, he was a guest judge on a BBC radio broadcast of the Piddingtons show. His role was to represent the eyes of listeners as the Piddingtons performed their telepathy act in the Piccadilly studios, and in the Tower of London. He was ensuring that no cheating was going on and overseeing the telepathy tests as a witness.http://www.thepiddingtons.com/broadcasts.html He was loaned to Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) to make two films: the musical The Dancing Years (1950), a sizeable hit; and the thriller Murder Without Crime (1950), less popular. Back at Rank, Price was a villain in The Adventurers, and was borrowed by 20th Century Fox for I'll Never Forget You (both 1951). He played the lead in Lady Godiva Rides Again (1951), and after a cameo in The Magic Box (1951) he had top billing in a comedy, Song of Paris (1952). =Supporting actor= Price supported in The Tall Headlines (1952) and had the lead in some B-films: Noose for a Lady (1953), Murder at 3am (1953) and Time Is My Enemy (1954). In \\"A\\" pictures he was now a supporting actor: The Intruder (1953), For Better, for Worse (1954), That Lady (1955), Oh... Rosalinda!! (1955), Private's Progress (1956), Charley Moon (1956) with Max Bygraves, Port Afrique (1956), A Touch of the Sun (1956), Fortune Is a Woman (1957), The Naked Truth (1957), Danger Within (1959), and I'm All Right Jack (1959). He was top billed in Don't Panic Chaps! (1959). In the 1950s, Price appeared in London and New York City in new plays and revivals of classics. It has been suggested that he was the first name actor on television to play a \\"more or less overtly gay role\\" in Crime on Our Hands (1954).Keith Howes \\"Are There Stars Out Tonight\\" in Robin Griffiths (ed) British Queer Cinema, Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 2006, p. 61-70, 63 In 1957, he made his debut in South Africa in lead roles in Separate Tables. As a radio actor, Price was the original \\"No. 1\\" in charge of the crew of HMS Troutbridge in the first series of the long-running radio comedy series The Navy Lark in 1959, but was unable to continue the role in the second series because of other work commitments; he was replaced by Stephen Murray. His film appearances from this period included Tunes of Glory (1960) and The Amorous Prawn (also known as The Playgirl and the War Minister, 1962). In Victim (1961) he portrayed one of several characters being blackmailed because of their (then illegal) homosexuality. In the horror spoof What a Carve Up! (1961) he starred alongside Kenneth Connor, Sid James, Shirley Eaton and Donald Pleasence, while in the science fiction film The Earth Dies Screaming (1964) he appeared alongside Willard Parker and Thorley Walters. In the BBC television series The World of Wooster (1965‚Äì67), Price's performance as Jeeves was described by The Times as \\"an outstanding success\\", and P. G. Wodehouse said Price had \\"that essential touch of Jeeves mystery\\". Working with Ian Carmichael as Bertie Wooster, this now almost completely lost series\\"(P. G. Wodehouse's) The World of Wooster\\", lostshows.com See also Michael Brooke \\"World of Wooster, The (1965-67)\\", BFI screenonline was based on the novels and short stories of P. G. Wodehouse. He also appeared in an episode of The Avengers. =Later years= In 1967, Price was declared bankrupt; he attributed his financial distress to \\"extravagant living and most inadequate gambling\\". He then moved to the tax haven island of Sark, which coincided with an escalation in his alcoholism. Towards the end of his life, Price appeared in a series of horror movies including Twins of Evil (1971), Horror Hospital (1973) and Theatre of Blood (1973), as well as five films directed by Jes√∫s Franco. One of his last film appearances was a star-studded version of Alice in Wonderland (1972) with Ralph Richardson, Robert Helpmann, Peter Sellers and Dudley Moore, among others.\\"Alice in Studioland\\", The Guardian, 10 June 1972, p. 8 On television, he had recurring roles in the ITC series Jason King (1971) and The Adventurer (1972). Price died of heart failure, complicated by a hip fracture, in Guernsey in 1973, at the age of 58. He is buried on Sark. In the book British Film Character Actors (1982), Terence Pettigrew wrote that Price's most successful screen characterisations were \\"refined, self-centred, caddish and contemptuous of a world inhabited by inferiors. Everything about him was deceptive. He could be penniless and still manage to look as if he owned the bank. But behind all that grand talk and lordly ways, there skulked, in his characters, the most ordinary of shabby, grasping souls.\\"Terence Pettigrew British Film Character Actors: Great Names and Memorable Moments, Newton Abbot, Devon: David & Charles, 1982, pp. 165‚Äì66  Personal life  Price was married to the actress Joan Schofield from 1939 to 1950. They had two daughters.The Guardian, 8 October 1973, p. 6 Price was bisexual. In April 1954, he tried to commit suicide by gas in a London guest house.The Manchester Guardian, 20 April 1954, p. 12 Public sympathy led to a revival of his career and the offer of film roles.

The Act, which was signed into law on 12 December 1936, was one of two passed hurriedly in the aftermath of the Edward VIII abdication crisis to sharply reduce the role of the Crown. It is also sometimes referred to as the External Relations Act. Background and provisions of the Act Under the Constitution of the Irish Free State as originally enacted, the executive authority of the Irish Free State was declared to be vested in the King and declared to be exercisable by the Governor-General as representative of the Crown. But the 1932 Irish general election was won by Fianna F√°il, led by √âamon de Valera and other republicans who had opposed the monarchial elements in the constitution, and part of their programme aimed to reduce the role and visibility of the monarch in Irish political life. In the aftermath of King Edward VIII's signing of an Instrument of Abdication on 10 December 1936, the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State enacted the Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolishing the office of the Governor-General so that thereafter the powers of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, insofar as internal matters were concerned, ceased to be exercised in the name of the King. While the Crown was thus abolished for the purposes of internal government, article 51 of the amendment allowed the Executive Council to, for the purposes of foreign relations, make use of \\"any organ used as a constitutional organ for the like purposes by [other nations of the Commonwealth].\\" The Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 was enacted the following day to implement that provision. It provided that the diplomatic and consular representatives of the Irish Free State in other countries should be appointed, and that the Irish Free State's international agreements should be concluded, by the King acting on the advice of the Executive Council (as. 1-2). Thus the Act preserved the Crown to a limited extent in the sphere of external relations. More particularly, the Act stipulated (s. 3(1)) that: It was in that manner specifically provided that so long as the Irish Free State was associated with the members of the British Commonwealth and so long as the members of the Commonwealth continue to recognize the King as the symbol of their special relationship and the King acts on their behalf in the sphere of external affairs, the King shall continue to act in the external relations of the Irish Free State. The meaning of this provision was a matter of considerable uncertainty. The Act also brought Edward VIII's Instrument of Abdication into effect for the purposes of Irish law (s. 3(2)). Due to the Act's phrasing, Edward VIII's abdication was actually back-dated to the day before that on which it took effect in the United Kingdom and most of the other Dominions. Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937 Unfortunately the speed with which the 1936 Act was passed also meant that some serious legal matters had been overlooked by the draughtsmen, touching on the top of the Irish legal hierarchy. In May 1937 these were covered by the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937. As the Governor-Generalship had not been actually abolished by the 1936 Act, this Act was required to validate the otherwise-unlawful appointment of the Chief Justice of Ireland Timothy Sullivan. Sullivan had in turn questionably appointed three High Court judges. The recent appointment of Patrick Lynch as the Attorney General of Ireland and even the pension of the outgoing Governor-General needed to be legalised. The External Relations Act and the 1937 constitution In 1937 the constitution of the Irish Free State was repealed and replaced by the Constitution of Ireland. Article 29.4 of the new constitution stated that: > 1¬∞ The executive power of the State in or in connection with its external > relations shall [...] be exercised by or on the authority of the Government. > 2¬∞ For the purpose of the exercise of any executive function of the State > in or in connection with its external relations, the Government may to such > extent and subject to such conditions, if any, as may be determined by law, > avail of or adopt any organ, instrument, or method of procedure used or > adopted for the like purpose by the members of any group or league of > nations with which the State is or becomes associated for the purpose of > international co-operation in matters of common concern. As a result, the role of the King remained unaffected and the External Relations Act remained in force. Repeal In the late 1940s, de Valera decided to change the law, though whether it would involve the total repeal of the Act or merely its amendment was not decided when he lost power in 1948. His then Attorney-General, Cearbhall √ì D√°laigh had been working on the various options when de Valera's Fianna F√°il administration was replaced by the First Inter-Party Government under Costello. The Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936 was finally repealed by the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force on 18 April 1949. The new Act vested the powers possessed by the King in the President of Ireland.

Mega Man, released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987, was the first in a series that expanded to over 50 games on multiple systems. As of December 31, 2019, the game series has sold 36 million units worldwide. The original Mega Man series consists of eleven main games, a side game titled Mega Man & Bass, as well as all Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear and other console games featuring the original design of Mega Man. Although the classic series has yet to reach an ending, the storyline shifts to the Mega Man X series, followed by the Mega Man Zero series, two Mega Man ZX games and three games for Mega Man Legends. All Mega Man series follow one continuous timeline except for Mega Man Battle Network and Mega Man Star Force.  Games = Original series = Mega Man battles mini-boss Hanabiran from Mega Man 9 in Hornet Man's stage. Note the run-and-gun and platform gameplay. In the story behind the original series, Mega Man is a robot originally named Rock, created as a lab assistant by the scientist Dr. Light with Dr. Wily as his partner. Following treachery by Dr. Wily in which he reprogrammed most of Dr. Light's robots, Rock volunteered to be converted into a fighting robot to defend the world from Wily's violent robotic threats, thus becoming Mega Man. Though all incarnations of Mega Man feature unique stories, settings, and characters, they share several common features. All main Mega Man games released prior to 1997 are side-scrolling action platformers. The player character must fight through the levels using Mega Man's \\"Mega Buster\\"‚Äîa cannon attached to his arm‚Äîto shoot the robotic enemies inhabiting his environment. When Mega Man was released in 1987, the characteristic that made it revolutionary was the choice given to the player of which robot master to attempt first. After defeating a Robot Master‚Äîthe boss of a level‚ÄîMega Man gains the ability to use that Robot Master's special weapon. Each Robot Master is representative of a specific element or object, with such bosses as Fire Man, Ice Man, Guts Man, Cut Man, Elec Man, and Bomb Man. The weapons Mega Man gains share the theme of the defeated boss. After defeating all of the Robot Masters, Mega Man travels to a multi-stage fortress to confront Dr. Wily, the person responsible for the robotic enemies' destructive acts. In the fortress, Mega Man fights past new bosses, clones of the game's Robot Masters, and Wily himself, who is usually in a large multi- phase war machine. Enemies are weak to at least one weapon; for instance, Fire Man will take more damage from Ice Man's weapon than from other weapons. This concept draws inspiration from rock-paper-scissors. Robot Master levels can generally be completed in any order, resulting in a strategic hallmark of the series: determining the best order to defeat bosses and earn weapons. Sequels of Mega Man games contain new enemies alongside familiar ones, new bosses and weapons, and perhaps new gadgets. Later installments of the game give the player the option of commanding other player characters with different abilities, such as Proto Man, Duo, and Bass. The Classic series has not reached a definite conclusion. Originally developed for the NES, the original Mega Man series experienced graphical improvements in fourth and fifth generation installments. The series had no games developed for sixth generation consoles but returned in the seventh generation purposely sporting graphics, sound and gameplay similar to the original NES games to inspire a nostalgic look and feel, distributed as downloadable content instead of retail games like the previous installments. On December 4, 2017, Capcom announced that a new game in the classic series, Mega Man 11, would release in late 2018. Unlike Mega Man 9 and 10, this game features modern, HD, cel-shaded graphics and is presented in a widescreen aspect ratio. When using a special weapon, in addition to changing colors, Mega Man's armor changes appearance as well. = Mega Man X = Capcom wanted a redesign in graphics and control as the Mega Man series moved from the NES to the SNES, prompting the creation of the Mega Man X series in 1993. Set in the future, this series follows the story of Mega Man's successor, Mega Man X, a new, advanced robot that has complete free will over his actions, thoughts and feelings. This character, often referred to as \\"X\\", is also a creation of Dr. Light, put into suspended animation and uncovered 100 years in the future by a researcher named Dr. Cain. The Mega Man X series features more detailed 16-bit graphics and greater freedom of movement. In the Mega Man X series, the characters grow in abilities and power as the game progresses. As the series progressed, various other player characters have appeared, such as fellow Maverick Hunter Zero who was created by Dr. Wily of the Classic series, OVER-1, created jointly by Dr. Light and Dr. Cossack, and Axl, a Reploid with an adolescent personality who has the ability to shape-shift into other Reploids. Zero would later star in his own spin-off series, Mega Man Zero. The Mega Man X series has not reached a conclusion, having been left unresolved since the eighth game in the spin- off franchise ended with a cliffhanger. A mobile game, Rockman X Dive, was released on March 23, 2020 in Taiwan. = Mega Man Zero = In 2002, a follow- up series to the Mega Man X franchise was developed for the Game Boy Advance which starred Zero, a character created for the Mega Man X series as a sidekick/ally of Mega Man. The series revolved around Zero battling a powerful human-supremacy force as he protects the oppressed remaining reploids. In the Mega Man Zero series, the gameplay is largely similar to Zero's play style in the later Mega Man X games and features an in-depth ranking system that rewards the player with new abilities and enhancements (such as copied abilities from boss characters) in exchange for better play performance. In the fourth game, Zero can also physically steal weapons from enemies (such as axes and guns). Mega Man Zero was, with its fourth game, the first series in the franchise to reach a definitive conclusion, although its storyline continues in the distant future with Mega Man ZX. The series has also been referenced in other media; in UMVC3, Zero's 4th skin was based on his appearance from Mega Man Zero. On April 1, 2020, Capcom Taiwan announced Zero from the Mega Man Zero Series would be playable in Rockman X DIVE. = Mega Man ZX = The first game in the Mega Man ZX series was released in 2006. It takes place about 200 years after the Zero series in which progression has led to the mixing of physical attributes between humans and robots; humans are given the physical advantages of robots, and robots are given lifespans. Therefore, this is the first game in the main storyline in which the player can control a human character. Players collect Biometals containing data on the legendary heroes of the past (including X, Zero, and the Four Guardians of the Mega Man Zero series). Using these Biometals, they are able to \\"Mega- Merge\\" with them to don the powers of the fallen heroes. Gameplay remains largely similar to the Mega Man Zero series, although the ranking system is mostly removed. In the second game, the player character is able to physically transform into fallen boss characters upon defeating them. The player is given the choice of choosing a male or female human protagonist in each installment, and the games imply that both characters do not exist in the same continuity. For example, Vent and Aile both have identical back-stories of being orphaned, have very similar appearances, and both work for Giro Express, but they are never seen together or mentioned to one another, therefore implying that they do not co-exist. The same occurs in the series's only sequel, Mega Man ZX Advent between protagonists Grey and Ashe, both of which meet either Aile or Vent respectively (depending on which player character is chosen), but not both. This makes ZX unique in that it creates two parallel timelines depending on which character is chosen: a timeline in which Aile and Grey exist and are the heroes donning the Biometals, or a timeline in which Vent and Ashe assume their roles instead. = Mega Man Legends = Beginning on the PlayStation in 1997, a 3D action game series called Mega Man Legends was created to take advantage of the console's advanced graphics hardware. The Legends series is set in the same world as the other Mega Man games, although thousands of years in the future. The world is covered by immense bodies of water and features the return of several major characters from the original series in different situations. The hero, Mega Man (Rock) Volnutt, is a relic hunter called a \\"Digger\\" who scavenges various ruins throughout the world in search of refractor shards that can be mined and traded as currency. Mega Man Legends brings the gameplay into 3D and is an action adventure with role-playing game elements. The Legends series concluded with only two main games and a spin-off starring mainstay antagonist Tron Bonne before being discontinued. Unlike Battle Network and Zero, the final game in the series does not resolve the storyline. A continuation to the Legends series has become an oft-requested game among many Capcom and Mega Man fans. A third game was once under development for the Nintendo 3DS, but on July 17, 2011, Capcom cancelled the project saying it did not meet certain requirements. This decision was met with criticism from fans and gaming news outlets. Despite the many years since the last new release in the series, various characters from the Legends series consistently appear in Capcom cross-over games such as Marvel vs. Capcom, and the Servbot characters have become iconic within the Capcom community, making many cameo appearances in non-Mega Man games, including Dead Rising and as part of the outfit obtained via achievements in Lost Planet 2. = Mega Man Battle Network = Mega Man Battle Network, a series primarily on the Game Boy Advance, began in 2001 as a way for the Mega Man games to branch out into the role-playing video game market and to celebrate MegaMans 15th anniversary. This series features a Net Navi called MegaMan.EXE. Net Navis act as virtual assistants to Operators, such as the protagonist Lan, an elementary school student and future hero who uses his Net Navi to help battle computer viruses and other Internet-based threats. The game combines elements from collectible card games to create a unique fast-paced battle system. An anime series, MegaMan NT Warrior, was also produced, ending with 209 episodes and a 50-minute film adaptation. Mega Man Network Transmission, the only entry in the series released on a home console rather than a handheld, takes place chronologically between the first two Battle Network games, although it was released between the third and fourth. It is also different from other games in the Battle Network universe in that its game play reminds strongly of the Classic series. Along with the Anime and Games, Mega Man Battle Network had toys mainly based on the Advanced PET from the series. the user would buy a starter pack which included 3 battle chips, and an Advanced PET, the toy came in two colors, Red (Based on Protoman.EXE), Black (Based on Bass.EXE), and Blue (Based on Megaman.EXE). several battle chip expansion packs were also released, when the toy was discontinued, a total of 333 Battle Chips were released. the toy could be linked together via a link cable with another Advanced PET to battle each other. Mega Man Battle Network was, with its sixth game, the second series in the franchise to reach a definitive conclusion, although the story continues in the distant future with Mega Man Star Force. = Mega Man Star Force = A follow-up to the Mega Man Battle Network series and released on the Nintendo DS, Star Forcess launch commemorated the 20th anniversary of the Mega Man franchise. The Star Force games are very similar to the Battle Network games, and also takes place roughly 200 years later in the timeline. Network technology has progressed with electromagnetic wave technology to connect the world via radio waves. The series stars a timid boy named Geo Stelar and an extraterrestrial EM-wave being named Omega-Xis who can merge into an EM-Human known as \\"Mega Man,\\" allowing the player to explore both the real world and the EM-world. Although each game has a different set of antagonists, they are usually EM-beings that are able to merge with humans to create new threats. The gameplay is very similar to the Battle Network series with an over-the-shoulder battle system and more simplified collectible card game elements, as well as faster-paced battle mechanics. An anime based on this series began airing on TV Tokyo in October 2006 for 76 episodes. = Rockman Xover = Rockman Xover („É≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éû„É≥ Xover Rokkuman Kurosu≈çbƒÅ, pronounced Rockman Crossover) is a game for Apple's iOS platform marking the 25th anniversary of the Mega Man franchise, and was released on November 29, 2012 on the Hong Kong iTunes Store. The game features a new protagonist, OVER-1 („Ç™„Éº„Éê„Éº „ÉØ„É≥ ≈åbƒÅ Wan), a Reploid created by Dr. Light and Dr. Cossack, confronting villains from the entire Mega Man franchise, who have crossed between dimensions to join forces. Capcom stated a North Americal release was cancelled due to largely negative feedback from Japanese fans.Mega Man Xover iOS game on hold in US. Retrieved January 2013 The game ceased operations on March 31, 2015.  In other media = In other video games = Various incarnations of Mega Man appear as playable fighters in the Marvel vs. Capcom series. The original was a playable fighter in Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes and Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes. He is assisted by his companion robots, Rush, Beat and Eddie. His sister robot, Roll, is also playable in both games, but is a secret character in the first game. Although he did not make a playable appearance in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, and its successor, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Zero from Mega Man X and Tron Bonne from Mega Man Legends appear as representatives for the series. Mega Man X appears as an alternate costume for Zero and Frank West and as a card in Heroes and Heralds mode. The original Mega Man appears in the arcade endings of Thor and Nova, and also appears on a poster in the Days of Future Past stage, and finally, as another card in Heroes and Heralds Mode. Mega Man X and Zero appear as playable characters in Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite, with Sigma appearing as both a DLC fighter and a major antagonist in the Story Mode, where he merges with the supervillain Ultron to become Ultron Sigma. MegaMan.EXE and Zero both appear as bonus playable characters in the fighting game Onimusha Blade Warriors, while a different version of Mega Man, based on his appearance on the American box art of the first game, appears as a playable fighter in the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions of Street Fighter X Tekken. Mega Man Volnutt and Roll also make an appearance in Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars, with Zero added to the U.S. version. In 2013, Mega Man appeared as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and its sequel, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. An amiibo based on his appearance was confirmed on November 11, and can be utilized in Super Smash Bros. as well as Mario Kart 8 where it can be scanned to unlock a costume for the player's Mii based on Mega Man's. In Super Mario Maker, the player can unlock a Mega Man costume by scanning the character's amiibo. In Monster Hunter: World, Mega Man is a playable character through downloadable content. = Television appearances = Mega Man's first television appearances were produced for the American market and were based on the classic series. First was Captain N: The Game Master (1989‚Äì91), a show that took place in a universe that was made up of many different Nintendo games. It featured Mega Man as a main character and also featured Dr. Wily as one of the antagonists. This was followed by Mega Man (1994‚Äì95), the first series to be based in the Mega Man universe. Mega Man next appeared in anime produced in Japan and based on spin-off series. First was MegaMan NT Warrior (2002‚Äì06), based on the Mega Man Battle Network video game series (both the anime and the video game series were known as Rockman.EXE in Japan). This was followed by Mega Man Star Force (2006‚Äì08), based on the video game series of the same name (both were known as Shooting Star Rockman in Japan). A series titled Mega Man: Fully Charged began airing in 2018. Unlike the previous anime, it is again an American-produced animated series loosely based on the classic series. = OVA = Mega Man starred in Mega Man: Upon a Star, a three-part OVA that was developed in Japan. Production on this series started in 1994, before the American TV series, but was not officially released in the United States until 2005. =Film adaptation= On September 2, 2015, 20th Century Fox, Chernin Entertainment and Capcom began developing a Mega Man movie with Peter Chernin producing along with Mike Ireland and Ryan Harrigan and David Ready and Michael Finfer overseeing the film. On July 19, 2017, Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman were hired to write and direct the film with Masi Oka producing. On August 8, 2019, it was reported that, following Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox's assets, the film along with numerous video game based movies in development at Fox were cancelled. However, on October 29, Capcom indicated to investors in a semi-annual report that the film is still in development at Disney. The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Mattson Tomlin will rewrite the script for Capcom and Chernin Entertainment. = Artbooks = Various artbooks and source books have been released for many years in Japan, often including conceptual artwork, interviews with production staff, and background information on the storyline and concepts that are not present within the games themselves. One of the most well-known is the Rockman Perfect Memories sourcebook released in 2002 which first confirmed the presence of an alternate timeline (for Battle Network), as well as exactly where the Legends series fit into the fictional Mega Man universe. Recently a series of artbooks called the Official Complete Works has been published for individual Mega Man series, showcasing a large collection of artwork and background information. To date, books for the Zero, Classic and X (released together as R20), Star Force, and Battle Network series have been produced. Although these books have for many years been exclusive to Japan, UDON Entertainment Corporation has finished translating the Official Complete Works series for the North American market, called \\"R25\\". Mega Man: Official Complete Works was re-released as a hardcover on October 16, 2018, Mega Man X: Official Complete Works was followed by a hardcover re-release on November 27, 2018. A hardcover re-release of Mega Man Zero: Official Complete Works was released on June 11, 2019. On April 2, 2019, it was announced that Mega Man Battle Network Official Complete Works would be getting a hardcover re-release on August 20, 2019. On October 31, 2019, it was announced that Mega Man Star Force Official Complete Works would be getting a hardcover re-release on May 5, 2020. = Comics = Mega Man has also been featured in many comics and manga in Japan, although few have been localized in North America. The most well-known series is produced by Hitoshi Ariga (who went on to provide character designs and artwork for future official Capcom releases, including the Super Famicom game Mega Man and Bass). The series began with Rockman Remix, followed with Rockman Megamix, and is currently being serialized as Rockman Gigamix. The Megamix portion of the series would eventually be brought to North American shores thanks to UDON Entertainment Corporation, also responsible for the localization of the short Mega Man ZX manga by Shin Ogino. In the original Mega Man series, Dr. Light was known as Dr. Right, so many of his robots featured in Ariga's comic have \\"R\\"s in their designs. UDON did not alter this detail in the English version of Mega Man Megamix.Ariga, Hitoshi. Mega Man Megamix Volume 1. UDON. Table of Contents. In addition, Viz Media localized the 13-volume Rockman EXE manga by Ryo Takamisaki under the name MegaMan NT Warrior. Takamisaki would later serialize a short adaptation of Mega Man Star Force 3 that was never published outside Japan. Some other manga series that have not been localized outside Japan include a 12-volume Rockman X adaptation by Yoshihiro Iwamoto, over 15 Classic and X adaptations by Shigeto Ikehara, a light-hearted adaptation of Rockman Zero by Hideto Kajima, a slapstick adaptation of Shooting Star Rockman by Masaya Itagaki, another Battle Network adaptation by Jun Keijima and Miho Asada called Rockman EXE Battle Story, and a short series of slapstick Battle Network and Star Force-themed adaptations by Takumi Kawano. Dreamwave Productions and Brazilian publisher Magnum Press made its own comic books based on the classic game series. The Brazilian series, Novas Aventuras de Megaman (\\"New Adventures of Megaman\\"), were originally published and sold in Brazil between 1996 and 1997 and drew certain criticism for featuring bizarrely altered storylines (with characters from several installments appearing at random, as well as erotic and sexual innuendo in Mega Man and X's relationship with Roll) as well for frequent nudity involving Roll5 Iconic Characters Who Got Insane Reboots in Foreign Comics and an original character named Princesa, which attempted to take over the status as the main character of the comics; its sudden end on a cliffhanger. The series was illustrated by Erica Awano, Eduardo Francisco, Daniel HDR and others.Megaman 1 The Dreamwave series lasted only four issues and also ended abruptly, with plot-threads from the first three issues being dropped completely in the final issue and the inclusion of a short story promising a Mega Man X follow-up that never materialized. This was one of several Dreamwave Capcom comics that were cut short or simply never made it to issue #1, including Maximo, Darkstalkers and Rival Schools. On July 20, 2017 it was announced that Mega Man Megamix would be getting remastered on January 24, 2018, titled ‚ÄúMega Man: Mastermix‚Äù These releases will contain remastered versions of the original stories and in full color provided by Josh Perez. And on September 29, 2018, It was announced that Mega Man Mastermix would be getting released in trade paperback form on April 2, 2019. Archie Comics In April 2011, Archie Comics released their first issue in an ongoing series of licensed comics based on the Mega Man franchise which features the titular character going against his nemesis Dr. Wily in various, original story arcs. The overall concept is created and almost exclusively written by Ian Flynn, who is also the current head writer for Archie Comics' other video game licensed comic series Sonic the Hedgehog. Consequently, as of May 2013, both series have been crossed-over in a major story arc called \\"Worlds Collide\\", which spans twelve issues between the Mega Man comics, the main Sonic the Hedgehog comics, and the latter's side-series Sonic Universe. The popularity of this crossover is such that another meeting of the two series, \\"Worlds Unite\\", was announced for spring of 2015. The series was put on ‚Äúindefinite hiatus‚Äù after Issue 55. = Junior novel = In 1990, a junior novel version of Mega Man 2 was released as part of the Worlds of Power novel series. Mega Man is turned human by Dr. Light during an accident in a machine designed to clone Mega Man. Instead of a Mega Buster, human Mega Man uses a hand gun, and instead of being able to copy the robot master's weapons, he instead takes them off of their arms. For some reason, being human does not affect him much and he is still able to consume E-drinks (Energy Tanks) and gain a power boost. The book follows the general plot of Mega Man 2 and even provides game hints at the end of some chapters. = Music = Ascertaining the identity of video game composers, especially prior to the fifth generation of consoles, can be difficult, as the composers were often uncredited or credited under a pseudonym. Recent soundtrack releases and interviews have discovered the true names of the composers; and in some cases, specific track credits. The indie rock music group The Protomen dedicated their first two albums to a rock opera based on Megaman, called The Protomen (2005) and Act II: The Father of Death (2009). Independent rap artist Mega Ran remixed several Megaman tracks for an album called Mega Ran (2007) and several follow-up albums, which were officially licensed by Capcom. He now holds a Guinness World Record for the most songs recorded referencing Megaman with 130. =Miscellaneous= In 1999, the Brazilian role-playing game magazine Drag√£o Brasil #14 published an adaptation for 3D&T; by Marcelo CassaroRevista Drag√£o Brasil and Jo√£o Paulo Nogueira.  Legacy collections  Being an older franchise, Mega Man has had many Legacy collections, Mega Man Legacy Collection 1 with 1‚Äì6 in the classic series and Legacy Collection 2 with 7, 8, 9, and 10. With the X series we have Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 with Mega Man X1-X4 and X Legacy Collection 2 having X5-X8. The Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection includes all four Mega Man Zero games, Mega Man ZX and Mega Man ZX Advent  Reception and legacy  According to GamesRadar, the Mega Man games were the first to feature a non-linear \\"level select\\" option. This was a stark contrast to both linear games (like Super Mario Bros.) and open world games (like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid). GamesRadar credits the \\"level select\\" feature of Mega Man as the basis for the non-linear mission structure found in most open-world, multi-mission, sidequest-heavy games, including modern games like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions. In Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist tenth episode \\"Raging Demon\\", Ryu and Ken were seen playing Mega Man 2 from a gift from Ken's father. The Mega Man X series has been positively received. The first Mega Man X game was widely acclaimed by critics since its release. Gaming magazines in the United States and Europe including Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM), GamePro, Game Players, Nintendo Power, Super Play, and the German version of Total! consistently lauded the game's visuals, audio, control, and overall gameplay. Game Players summarized Mega Man X as \\"a near-perfect cart with classic gameplay, excellent graphics and sound and tons of hidden items and power- ups\\". Nintendo Power stated that the game had \\"great control and fun\\" along with \\"challenging play\\". Websites such as IGN, GameSpot, GamesRadar, and 1UP.com retrospectively held Mega Man X as a successful milestone in transitioning the Mega Man series from its increasingly stale existence on the NES to the SNES. Brett Elston of GamesRadar stated, \\"X was a total reinvention of the series, a perfectly executed update that had fans anticipating its release with a fervor the franchise hadn't seen since the Mega Man 2 and 3 days.\\" Mega Man X received criticism from some publications as well. Ed Semrad, Danyon Carpenter, and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all noted that the game may have too low a difficulty level; Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well. Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging. \\"A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits,\\" Nicholson explained. \\"Within the level you'll also find restart points, extra lives, and no harsh time limit to put pressure on your performance. Couple this with a password system that records your level completion, status and weapon accumulation and you'll see we're not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player.\\" Nintendo Power criticized how little the game had changed stating that \\"the theme remains the same as the Game Boy and NES Mega Man titles.\\" The game's title initially proved a source of some confusion; the gaming media reported that many gamers mistook the \\"X\\" for the roman numeral 10. Mega Man X was ranked number 58 in Nintendo Power's \\"100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time\\" in its 100th issue in September 1997, number 103 in the publication's \\"Top 200 Games\\" list for its 200th issue in February 2006, and the 11th best SNES game of all time in its August 2008 issue. Both GamesRadar and ScrewAttack listed Mega Man X as the eighth best game in the SNES library. GamePro similarly listed it as the eighth greatest 16-bit video game. Game Informer considered it the 120th best game of all time in its own 200th issue in December 2009. IGN named it the twelfth-best on its own top 100 SNES games list in 2011. Mega Man X was a commercial success. The SNES version has sold 1.16 million copies worldwide to date, making it the 41st best-selling Capcom game of all time. IGN's Jeremy Dunham speculated that the game's more mature storyline and its inclusion of numerous gameplay extensions over the original Mega Man series helped create a \\"unique cadre of fans\\". A spin-off series, Mega Man Zero, began in 2002 on the Game Boy Advance handheld as a result of the immense popularity of the character Zero. The Mega Man Zero games have earned generally positive reviews. Review sources both criticized and praised the high difficulty level of the game and remarked that they were similar in nature to earlier installments in the Mega Man series. Positive reviews noted the variety of abilities and customization along with an engaging story than compared to its prequel series, while negative reviews focused on the series repetitiveness and lack of originality. Review scores were lower for the last two games in the series, with critics pointing out that the games were just using the same gameplay without introducing anything new. When the first game in the series came out, reviewers were quick to hail a return to what they considered \\"the Mega Man roots\\", however some fans criticized that the lack of knowing which boss the player will face next was a change for the worse and that it \\"takes away what made the series unique in the past\\". Overall, the character of Mega Man has been well received by critics. IGN called him an icon of Capcom. Nintendo Power listed Mega Man as their fourth favourite hero, citing his ability to steal weapons from downed Robot Masters. Mega Man was also listed as the best robot in video games by many sources such Joystick Division, UGO Networks, and Complex. GameDaily ranked him as the best Capcom character of all time. UGO Networks listed Mega Man as one of their best heroes of all time, and called him \\"one of the most iconic video game heroes of all time\\". He was included in GameSpot's \\"All Time Greatest Video Game Hero\\" contest and reached the \\"Elite Eight\\" round before losing to Mario. In a Famitsu poll done in February 2010, Mega Man was voted by readers as the twenty-second most popular video game character. The 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition lists Mega Man as the 23rd most popular video game character. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 12th \\"most memorable, influential, and badass\\" protagonist in games. Complex ranked him as having the tenth best fighting game cameos for his guest appearances in Street Fighter X Tekken in 2012. Joystick Division cited his rivalry with Dr. Wily as seventh of the ten greatest in video games, adding giving \\"great credit to this rivalry for its open-endedness\\" and GamesRadar listed him and Proto Man as having one of the best brotherly rivalries in gaming. UGO Networks have placed Mega Man as the eighth character who most deserves his own movie. 1UP.com described Mega Man as \\"Capcom's ill-treated mascot\\", and \\"one of the most incongruous characters of all time\\", saying \\"it wouldn't be completely incorrect to assume that the popularity of the series has almost nothing to do with Mega Man himself\\", but with \\"his rivals, his enemies, and their abilities.\\" IGN agreed with his dependency on support characters, saying Zero is \\"cooler than Mega Man\\". Den of Geek listed Mega Man's incarnation from Street Fighter X Tekken as the 15th best cameo in fighting game history due to how it represented Capcom's lack of interest in featuring other games as of 2012, as well as the apparent self-mockery of it due to Mega Man's poor characterization. Destructoid described this Mega Man as \\"legit\\" stating it was \\"an unexpected and interesting creative decision by [Capcom] using this version of Mega Man to represent them in what may be one of their biggest games of 2012\\". Mega Man series director Keiji Inafune announced the similarly themed Mighty No. 9 in September 2013, but after much controversy surrounding delays and mishandling, the game was released in June 2016 to a mixed-to- negative reception. Batterystaple Games released the Mega Man X-inspired 20XX in 2014.

It is not just the price mechanism but the entire system of regulation, qualification, credentials, reputations and clearing that surrounds that mechanism and makes it operate in a social context. Some authors use the term \\"market system\\" to refer to specifically to the free market system. This article focuses on the more general sense of the term according to which there are a variety of different market systems. Market systems are different from voting systems. A market system relies on buyers and sellers being constantly involved and unequally enabled; in a voting system, candidates seek the support of voters on a less regular basis. In addition (a) buyers make decisions on their own behalves, whereas voters make decisions for collectives, (b) voters are usually fully aware of their participation in social decision-making, whereas buyers are often unaware of the secondary repercussions of their acts, (c) responsibility for making purchasing decisions is concentrated on the individual buyer, whereas responsibility for making collective decisions is divided, (d) different buying decisions at the same time are made under conditions of scarcity --- the selection of one thing precludes the selection of another, whereas different voting decisions are not --- one can vote for a president and a judge in the same election without one vote precluding the other, and (e) under ordinary conditions, a buyer is choosing to buy an actual good and is therefore never overruled in his choice, whereas it is the nature of voting that the voter is choosing among potential alternatives and may be overruled by other voters. However, the interactions between market and voting systems are an important aspect of political economy, and some argue they are hard to differentiate; for example, systems like cumulative voting and runoff voting involve a degree of market-like bargaining and trade-off, rather than simple statements of choice. Types In economics, market forms are studied. These look at the impacts of a particular form on larger markets, rather than technical characteristics of how bidders and sellers interact. Heavy reliance on many interacting market systems and different forms of markets is a feature of capitalism, and advocates of socialism often criticize markets and aim to substitute markets with economic planning to varying degrees. Competition is the regulatory mechanism of the market system. This article does not discuss the political impact of any particular system nor applications of a particular mechanism to any particular problem in real life. For more on specific types of real-life markets, see commodity markets, insurance markets, bond markets, energy markets, flea markets, debt markets, stock markets, online auctions, media exchange markets, real estate market, each of which is explained in its own article with features of its application, referring to market systems as such if needed. One of the most important characteristics of a market economy, also called a free enterprise economy, is the role of a limited government. Protocols The market itself provides a medium of exchange for the contracts and coupons and cash to seek prices relative to each other, and for those to be publicized. This publication of current prices is a key feature of market systems, and is often relevant far beyond the current groups of buyers and sellers, affecting others' supply and demand decisions, e.g. whether to produce more of a commodity whose price is now falling. Market systems are more abstract than their application to any one use, and typically a 'system' describes a protocol of offering or requesting things for sale. Well-known market systems that are used in many applications include: *auctions - the most common, including: **Dutch auctions **reverse auctions **silent auctions *rationing *Administrative allocation (including the command economy of some states) *regulated market (including most real-life examples as above) *black market (the term 'black' indicating lack of regulation, or any trade, often illegal, operating in violation of official regulations) The term 'laissez- faire' (\\"let alone\\") is sometimes used to describe some specific compromise between regulation and black market, resulting in the political struggle to define or exploit \\"free markets\\". This is not an easy matter to separate from other debates about the nature of capitalism. There is no such thing as a \\"free\\" market other than in the sense of a black market, and most free-market advocates favor at least some form of regulated market, e.g. to prevent outright fraud, theft, and retain some degree of credibility with the larger public. This political debate is out of the scope of this article, other than to note that the \\"free\\" market is usually a \\"less regulated\\" market, but not qualitatively different from other regulated markets, in any society with laws, and that what opponents of \\"free markets\\" usually seek is some kind of moral purchasing rather than pure rationing. As this debate suggests, key debates over market systems relate to their accessibility, safety, fairness, and ability to guarantee clearance and closure of all transactions in a reasonable period of time. Importance of trust The degree of trust in a political or economic authority (such as a bank or central bank) is often critical in determining the success of a market. A market system depends inherently on a stable money system to ensure that units of account and standards of deferred payment are uniform across all players - and to ensure that the balance of contracts due within that market system are accepted as a store of value, i.e. as \\"collateral\\" of the holder of the contract, which justifies \\"credit\\" from a lender of cash. Banks, themselves, are often described in terms of markets, as \\"transducers of trust\\" between lenders (who deposit money) and borrowers (who take it out again). Trust in the bank to manage this process makes more economic activity possible. However, critics say, this trust is also quite easy to abuse, and has many times proven difficult to limit or control (see business cycle), resulting in 'runs on banks' and other such 'crises of trust' in 'the system'. Criticisms In The Economics of Innocent Fraud, Economist John Kenneth Galbraith criticized the concept of the \\"market system\\" as nonsensical and as a weasel word intended to replace the term \\"capitalism\\", but which does not specify anything specific.  Marketing System  Marketing System is a consistent pattern of provisioning relationships in society that exists between members of society including individuals, firms, communities and institutions. While marketing, in the sense of firm's micro marketing activities, can be the same across contexts, cultures, and nations, a marketing system is a unique market structure pertaining to a specific context (e.g. agricultural marketing systems in Africa). Marketing system is a differentiated subset of social system. Marketing system is a general term that represents how different patterns of the flows of goods/services from producers to consumers are culturally (uniquely) organised, whereas terms such as market system (a market based economic system of the West), horizontal marketing system (cooperation between two firms at the same level), and digital marketing system (a specific type of centralised channel distribution) represent its context-specific variations. Marketing systems are mostly researched within the discipline of macromarketing. = Definition = The notion of \\"aggregated marketing system\\" signifies all marketing practices at the societal level. Roger Layton defines a marketing system as \\"a network of individuals, groups and/or entities, embedded in a social matrix, linked directly or indirectly through sequential or shared participation in economic exchange, which jointly and/or collectively creates economic value with and for customers, through the offer of assortments of goods, services, experiences and ideas, that emerge in response to or anticipation of customer demand\\". Marketing systems can be rudimentary or complex, emergent or purposefully designed, spatio-temporal or virtual; these can also be aggregate, parallel, symbolic, dignity-based and chrematistics-driven. From the societal perspective, a marketing system represents a public good which can have value over and beyond goods/services it generates. = MAS theory = MAS (mechanism, action, structure) theory of marketing systems proposed by Layton focuses on social mechanisms, strategic action fields, and emergent marketing system structure to explicate potential sources and causes of marketing system's formation, adaptation, and evolution. Social mechanisms include cooperation, specialisation, and self-organisation, while strategic action fields comprise the action and practices of marketing system actors in their specific roles. Layton argues that marketing systems emerge as localised exchanges grow in scope and become stabilised while specialisation expands, and in addition, as key structures become formalised. = MSPG theory = MSPG (marketing systems as a public good) theory conceptualises a marketing system as a purposefully designed structure that resembles a \\"public good\\" in its features. According to this theory, the holistic design of a marketing system as a public good enables its structural elements (e.g. goods, value, exchanges and processes) to become meaningful. Hence, purposeful design precedes emergence. = Symbolism in Marketing Systems = Marketing systems are strongly driven by symbolism.

A queen consort usually shares her spouse's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the regent's political and military powers. In contrast, a queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch. Titles The title of prince consort for the husband of a reigning queen is rare. Examples are Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, in Scotland; Antoine of Bourbon-Vend√¥me in Navarre; Francis, Duke of C√°diz, in Spain; and Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in Portugal. Where some title other than that of king is held by the sovereign, his wife is referred to by the feminine equivalent, such as princess consort or empress consort. In monarchies where polygamy has been practiced in the past (such as Morocco and Thailand), or is practiced today (such as the Zulu nation and the various Yoruba polities), the number of wives of the king varies. In Morocco, King Mohammed VI has broken with tradition and given his wife, Lalla Salma, the title of princess. Prior to the reign of King Mohammed VI, the Moroccan monarchy had no such title. In Thailand, the king and queen must both be of royal descent. The king's other consorts are accorded royal titles that confer status. Other cultures maintain different traditions on queenly status. A Zulu chieftain designates one of his wives as \\"Great Wife\\", which would be the equivalent to queen consort. Conversely, in Yorubaland, all of a chief's consorts are essentially of equal rank. Although one of their number, usually the one who has been married to the chief for the longest time, may be given a chieftaincy of her own to highlight her relatively higher status when compared to the other wives; she does not share her husband's ritual power as a chieftain. When a woman is to be vested with an authority similar to that of the chief, she is usually a lady courtier in his service who is not married to him, but who is expected to lead his female subjects on his behalf. Role In general, the consorts of monarchs have no power , even when their position is constitutionally or statutorily recognized. However, often the queen consort of a deceased king (the dowager queen or queen mother) has served as regent if her child, the successor to the throne, was still a minor‚Äîfor example: * Anne of Kiev, wife of Henry I of France * Munjeong, mother of King Myeongjong of Korea * Mary of Guise, mother of Mary, Queen of Scots * Catherine of Austria, grandmother of Sebastian of Portugal * Marie de Medici, mother of Louis XIII of France * K√∂sem Sultan, mother of Sultan Murad IV of the Ottoman Empire * Luisa de Guzm√°n, mother of Afonso VI of Portugal * Lakshmi Bai, the Rani of Jhansi and mother of Damodar Rao * Maria Christina of Austria, mother of Alfonso XIII of Spain * Emma of Waldeck and Pyrmont, mother of Wilhelmina of the Netherlands *Anna Khanum, mother of Abbas II of Persia * Helen of Greece, mother of King Michael of Romania Besides these examples, there have been many cases of queens consort being shrewd or ambitious stateswomen and, usually (but not always) unofficially, being among the king's most trusted advisors. In some cases, the queen consort has been the chief power behind her husband's throne; e.g. Maria Luisa of Parma, wife of Charles IV of Spain. Examples of queens and empresses consort Anne of Bohemia and Hungary, consort of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor Queen Catherine (1550‚Äì1612), consort of King Eric XIV of Sweden Sophia Magdalene wearing the crown of the Queen of Sweden.

Traditionally needlepoint designs completely cover the canvas. Although needlepoint may be worked in a variety of stitches, many needlepoint designs use only a simple tent stitch and rely upon color changes in the yarn to construct the pattern. Needlepoint is the oldest form of canvas work. The degree of detail in needlepoint depends on the thread count of the underlying mesh fabric. Due to the inherent lack of suppleness of needlepoint, common uses include eyeglass cases, holiday ornaments, pillows, purses, upholstery, and wall hangings. History The roots of needlepoint go back thousands of years to the ancient Egyptians, who used small slanted stitches to sew up their canvas tents. Howard Carter, of Tutankhamen fame, found some needlepoint in the cave of a Pharaoh who had lived around 1500 BC. Modern needlepoint descends from the canvas work in tent stitch, done on an evenly woven open ground fabric that was a popular domestic craft in the 16th century. Further development of needlepoint was influenced in the 17th century by Bargello and in the 19th century by shaded Berlin wool work in brightly colored wool yarn. Upholstered furniture became fashionable in the 17th century, and this prompted the development of a more durable material to serve as a foundation for the embroidered works of art. In 18th century America, needlepoint was used as a preparatory skill to train young women to sew their own clothing. Terminology File:Fig. 254. Half cross stitch.jpgNeedlepoint is worked upon specialized types of stiff canvas that have openings at regular intervals. File:Borduurring.jpgEmbroidery that is not needlepoint often uses soft cloth and requires an embroidery hoop. When referring to handcrafted textile arts which a speaker is unable to identify, the appropriate generalized term is \\"needlework\\". The first recorded use of the term needlepoint is in 1869, as a synonym for point-lace. Mrs Beeton's Beeton's Book of Needlework (1870) does not use the term \\"needlework\\", but rather describes \\"every kind of stitch which is made upon canvas with wool, silk or beads\\" as Berlin Work (also spelled Berlinwork). Berlin Work refers to a subset of needlepoint, popular in the mid-19th Century that was stitched in brightly colored wool on needlepoint canvas from hand- colored charts. \\"Needlepoint\\" refers to a particular set of stitching techniques worked upon stiff openwork canvas. However, \\"needlepoint\\" is not synonymous with all types of embroidery. Because it is stitched on a fabric that is an open grid, needlepoint is not embellishing a fabric, as is the case with most other types of embroidery, but literally the making of a new fabric. It is for this reason that many needlepoint stitches must be of sturdier construction than other embroidery stitches. Needlepoint is often referred to as \\"tapestry\\" in the United Kingdom and sometimes as \\"canvas work\\". However, needlepoint‚Äîwhich is stitched on canvas mesh‚Äîdiffers from true tapestry‚Äîwhich is woven on a vertical loom. When worked on fine weave canvas in tent stitch, it is also known as \\"petit point\\". Additionally, \\"needlepoint lace\\" is also an older term for needle lace, an historic lace-making technique. Contemporary techniques=Materials= The thread used for stitching may be wool, silk, cotton or combinations, such as wool-silk blend. Variety fibers may also be used, such as metallic cord, metallic braid, ribbon, or raffia. Stitches may be plain, covering just one thread intersection with a single orientation, or fancy, such as in bargello or other counted-thread stitches. Plain stitches, known as tent stitches, may be worked as basketweave, continental or half cross. Basketweave uses the most wool, but does not distort the rectangular mesh and makes for the best-wearing piece. Several types of embroidery canvas are available: single thread and double thread embroidery canvas are open even-weave meshes, with large spaces or holes to allow heavy threads to pass through without fraying. Canvas is sized by mesh sizes, or thread count per inch. Sizes vary from 5 threads per inch to 24 threads per inch; popular mesh sizes are 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24. The different types of needlepoint canvas available on the market are interlock, mono, penelope, plastic, and rug. *Interlock Mono Canvas is more stable than the others and is made by twisting two thin threads around each other for the lengthwise thread and \\"locking\\" them into a single crosswise thread. Interlock canvas is generally used for printed canvases. Silk gauze is a form of interlock canvas, which is sold in small frames for petit-point work. Silk gauze most often comes in 32, 40 or 48 count, although some 18 count is available and 64, 128 and other counts are used for miniature work. *Mono canvas comes in the widest variety of colors (especially 18 mesh) and is plain woven, with one weft thread going over and under one warp thread. This canvas has the most possibilities for manipulation and open canvas. It is used for hand-painted canvases as well as counted thread canvaswork. *Penelope canvas has two threads closely grouped together in both warp and weft. Because these threads can be split apart, penelope sizes are often expressed with two numbers, such as 10/20. *Plastic canvas is a stiff canvas that is generally used for smaller projects and is sold as \\"pre-cut pieces\\" rather than by the yard. Plastic canvas is an excellent choice for beginners who want to practice different stitches. *Rug canvas is a mesh of strong cotton threads, twisting two threads around each other lengthwise forms the mesh and locking them around a crosswise thread made the same way; this cannot be separated. Canvases come in different gauges, and rug canvas is 3.3 mesh and 5 mesh, which is better for more detailed work. =Frames and hoops= Needlepoint canvas is stretched on a scroll frame or tacked onto a rectangular wooden frame to keep the work taut during stitching. Petit point is sometimes worked in a small embroidery hoop rather than a scroll frame. =Patterns= Commercial designs for needlepoint may be found in different forms: hand-painted canvas, printed canvas, trammed canvas, charted canvas, and free-form. In hand-painted canvas, the design is painted on the canvas by the designer, or painted to their specifications by an employee or contractor. Canvases may be stitch-painted, meaning each thread intersection is painstakingly painted so that the stitcher has no doubts about what color is meant to be used at that intersection. Alternatively, they may be hand-painted, meaning that the canvas is painted by hand but the stitcher will have to use their judgment about what colors to use if a thread intersection is not clearly painted. Hand-painted canvases allow the stitcher to give free range to their creativity with threads and unique stitches by not having to pay attention to a separate chart. In North America this is the most popular form of needlepoint canvas. Printed canvas is when the design is printed by silk screening or computer onto the needlepoint canvas. Printing the canvas in this means allows for faster creation of the canvas and thus has a lower price than Hand-Painted Canvas. However, care must be taken that the canvas is straight before being printed to ensure that the edges of the design are straight. Designs are typically less involved due to the limited color palette of this printing method. The results (and the price) of printed canvas vary extensively. Often printed canvases come as part of kits, which also dramatically vary in quality, based on the printing process and the materials used. This form of canvas is widely available outside North America. On a trammed canvas the design is professionally stitched onto the canvas by hand using horizontal stitches of varying lengths of wool of the appropriate colours. The canvas is usually sold together with the wool required to stitch the trammed area. The stitcher then uses tent stitch over the horizontal lines with the trame stitches acting as an accurate guide as to the colour and number of stitches required. This technique is particularly suited to designs with a large area of mono-colour background as such areas do not require tramming, reducing the cost of the canvas and allowing the stitcher to choose the background colour themselves. The Portuguese island of Madeira is the historic centre for the manufacture of trammed canvases. Charted canvas designs are available in book or leaflet form. They are available at book stores and independent needlework stores. Charted Canvas designs are typically printed in two ways: either in grid form with each thread intersection being represented with a symbol that shows what color is meant to be stitched on that intersection, or as a line drawing where the stitcher is to trace the design onto his canvas and then fill in those areas with the colors listed. Books typically include a grouping of designs from a single designer such as Kaffe Fassett or Candace Bahouth, or may be centered on a theme such as Christmas or Victorian Needlepoint. Leaflets usually include one to two designs and are usually printed by the individual designer. Free-form needlepoint designs are created by the stitcher. They may be based around a favorite photograph, stitch, thread color, etc. The stitcher just starts stitching! Many interesting pieces are created this way. It allows for the addition of found objects, appliqu√©, computer-printed photographs, goldwork, or specialty stitches. While traditionally needlepoint has been done to create a solid fabric, more modern needlepoint incorporates colored canvas, a variety of fibers and beadwork. Different stitching techniques also allow some of the unstitched, or lightly stitched, canvas to show through, adding an entirely new dimension to needlepoint work. Some of these techniques include \\"shadow\\" or \\"light\\" stitching, blackwork on canvas, and pattern darning. Needlepoint continues to evolve as stitchers use new techniques and threads, and add appliqu√© or found materials. The line between needlepoint and other forms of embroidery is becoming blurred as new stitchers adapt techniques and materials from other forms of embroidery to needlepoint. Famous needlepointers= Historical and political figures= Royal needlepointers include: Mary, Queen of Scots,The Marian Hanging, worked by Mary Queen of Scots between 1570 and 1585, an embroidered silk velvet in silks and silver-gilt thread, applied canvaswork, lined with silk.

In fact, the American Needlepoint Guild has established a Princess Grace Award (Needlepoint) for needlepoint completed entirely in tent stitch. (This award is not formally associated with the Princess Grace Foundation which presents the \\"Princess Grace Awards\\".) An American historical figure who was an avid needlepointer is Martha Washington, the wife of George Washington., where it states \\"Mrs. Washington was a notable needlewoman\\". = Modern celebrities= American football player Roosevelt \\"Rosey\\" Grier released a book titled Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men (1973) that shows Grier stitching and samples of his work. Actress Mary Martin's book Mary Martin's Needlepoint (1969) catalogues her works and provides needlework tips. The American actress Sylvia Sidney sold needlepoint kits featuring her designs, and she published two popular instruction books: Sylvia Sidney's Needlepoint Book and The Sylvia Sidney Question and Answer Book on Needlepoint. The MTV documentary 9 Days and 9 Nights with Ed Sheeran (2014) revealed that Taylor Swift made Sheeran a drake-themed needlepoint as a friendship gesture. Actress Loretta Swit's book, A Needlepoint Scrapbook (1986), includes a design for Ms. Pac-Man. Needlepoint stitches Most commercial needlework kits recommend one of the variants of tent stitch, although Victorian cross stitch and random long stitch are also used.The Tapestry Kit Collection: Recommended Stitches Authors of books of needlepoint designs sometimes use a wider range of stitches.e.g. Gordon, Jill Take Up Needlepoint 1994 London, Merehurst e.g. Russell, Beth Traditional Needlepoint 1992 Devon, David & Charles Historically, a very wide range of stitches have been used including: *Arraiolos stitch *Brick Stitch *(Victorian) Cross Stitch *Encroaching Upright Gobelin stitch *Gobelin stitch *Hungarian Ground stitch *Hungarian point stitch *Mosaic stitch *Old Florentine stitch *Parisian stitch *Random Long Stitch *Smyrna stitch *Tent stitches - Basketweave, Continental and Half cross variants *Upright cross stitch *Whipped flower stitch There are many books that teach readers how to create hundreds, if not thousands, of stitches. Some were written by famous stitchers, such as Mary Martin and Sylvia Sydney. However, the most popular and long-lived is The Needlepoint BookChristensen, Jo Ippolito, The Needlepoint Book, 2015, New York, Simon & Schuster by Jo Ippolito Christensen, Simon & Schuster. First published in 1976 by Prentice-Hall, the widely distributed text has been continuously in print and was revised in 2015. Over 425,000 copies have been sold as of 2017. It contains 436 stitches and 1680 illustrations in 560 pages. In popular culture A needlepoint stitched by Cullen Bohannon's murdered wife, Mary, is referred to repeatedly throughout Hell on Wheels season 1. For example, in episode 2, \\"Immoral Mathematics\\" (November 13, 2011), Bohannon flashes back to seeing Mary stitching the needlepoint; in episode 3, \\"A New Birth of Freedom\\"(November 20, 2011), Bohannon finds a piece of that finished needlework in the personal effects of the now-deceased foreman, Daniel Johnson (who in the previous episode had admitted to being part of the Union outfit that raped and killed Mary); and in episode 4, \\"Jamais je ne t'oublierai\\" (November 27, 2011), the inebriated Bohannon realizes he's lost the needlepoint, and he gets into a fight with Bolan, when the latter tauntingly reveals that he has the swatch.

The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story. The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity. For instance, the Dortmunder stories of Donald E. Westlake are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters -- in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property. By contrast, the same author's Parker stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime -- the criminal equivalent of the police procedural. Others, such as Lawrence Block's Bernie Rhodenbarr novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of burglar Rhodenbarr's criminal talents to solve murders. A caper may appear as a subplot in a larger work. For example, Tom Sawyer's plot to steal Jim out of slavery in the last part of Huckleberry Finn is a classic caper.  Etymology  The verb to caper means to leap in a frolicsome way,Caper; definition 2 from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary and probably derives from capriole,Capriole from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary which derives from the Latin for goat (Capra). The noun caperCaper; definition 3 from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary means a frolicsome leap, a capricious escapade or an illegal or questionable act.

In U.S. federal civil court cases, the term has been replaced by the renewed judgment as a matter of law, which emphasizes its relationship to the judgment as a matter of law, formerly called a directed verdict.See Rule 50, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended through Dec. 1, 2015. In U.S. federal criminal cases, the term is \\"judgment of acquittal\\".See Rule 29(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, as amended through Dec. 1, 2015. JNOV is the practice in American courts whereby the presiding judge in a civil jury trial may overrule the decision of a jury and reverse or amend their verdict. In literal terms, the judge enters a judgment notwithstanding the jury verdict. The rarely-granted intervention permits the judge to exercise discretion to avoid extreme and unreasonable jury decisions.Rule 50(b). Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. A judge may not enter a JNOV of \\"guilty\\" following a jury acquittal in United States criminal cases. Such an action would violate a defendant's Fifth Amendment right not to be placed in double jeopardy and Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. If the judge grants a motion to set aside judgment after the jury convicts, however, the action may be reversed on appeal by the prosecution. A JNOV is appropriate only if the judge determines that no reasonable jury could have reached the given verdict. For example, if a party enters no evidence on an essential element of their case but the jury still finds in their favor, the court may rule that no reasonable jury would have disregarded the lack of evidence on that key point and reform the judgment. The reversal of a jury's verdict by a judge occurs when the judge believes that there were insufficient facts on which to base the jury's verdict or that the verdict did not correctly apply the law. That procedure is similar to a situation in which a judge orders a jury to arrive at a particular verdict, called a directed verdict. A judgment notwithstanding the verdict is occasionally made when a jury refuses to follow a judge's instruction to arrive at a certain verdict.Rule 50(a). Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The user makes a request with their home library; which, acting as an intermediary, identifies libraries with the desired item, places the request, receives the item, makes it available to the user, as well as arranges for its return. The lending library usually sets a due date and overdue fees of the material borrowed. Although books and journal articles are the most frequently requested items, some libraries will lend audio recordings, video recordings, maps, sheet music, and microforms of all kinds. In some cases, nominal fees accompany the interlibrary loan services. The term document delivery may also be used for a related service, namely the supply of journal articles and other copies on a personalized basis, whether these come from other libraries or direct from the publishers. The end user is usually responsible for any fees, such as costs for postage or photocopying. Commercial document delivery services will borrow on behalf of any customer willing to pay for their rates. Procedures A patron picking up books they requested through interlibrary loan. Interlibrary loan, or resource sharing, has two operations: borrowing and lending. * A borrowing library sends an owning library a request to borrow, photocopy, or scan materials that is needed by their patron. * The owning library fills the request by sending materials to the borrowing library or supply a reason for why the request cannot be filled. * If the item is sent, the borrowing library notifies the patron when the item arrives. Interlibrary loan and resource sharing have a variety of systems and workflows, often based on the scale of service, regional networks, and library systems. Processes are automated by computer systems such as VDX based on ISO ILL standards 10161 and 10160. Two major systems are used heavily: ILLiad developed by Atlas Systems and Worldshare Management System by OCLC. In 2017, OCLC announced a new interlibrary loan management system called Tipasa, which is built on the OCLC WorldShare technology platform, and is the first entirely cloud-based interlibrary loan management system. Loan requests between branch libraries in the same local library system are usually filled promptly, while loan requests between library systems may take weeks to complete. However, if an item is rare, fragile, or exceptionally valuable, the owning library is under no obligation to release it for interlibrary loan. Some collections and volumes, especially bound journals and one-of-a-kind manuscripts, are non-circulating, meaning that they may not be borrowed. Books may be delivered by mail or by courier service. Photocopies may be faxed, or scanned and delivered electronically. Urgent requests are placed if the item is needed right away; sometimes for additional fees. Public libraries do not usually offer urgent service. = Journal articles = Interlibrary loan provides users with access to articles from journals that their library does not have in its collection or is subscribed to. In the United States, most libraries follow guidelines established by the Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted works (CONTU), which established that libraries should pay publishers' fees if more than 5 ILL requests are filled from within the past 5 years from a specific publication. This guideline is referred to in United States Libraries as the \\"Rule of Five.\\" In addition, many journal or database licenses specify whether a library can or cannot supply journal articles via ILL, with many libraries taking an approach to negotiate for ILL to be allowed in licenses. When licensed to send articles via Interlibrary Loan, and having examined the need to pay copyright fees for articles, article processing has become highly automated in Interlibrary Loan. In the early 1990s the Research Library Group (RLG) created and released Ariel, a software that made communicating both photocopies and native digital articles more efficient. In the early 2000s Atlas Systems, creators of the ILLiad software system, created Odyssey, which allowed for direct communication of articles between libraries, and ultimately direct sending of articles to library patrons. Although Odyssey usage and features increased quickly, OCLC realized an important need among its member libraries, and created Article Exchange, which is a cloud-based secure article sharing platform that automatically deletes articles after a specified number of downloads and/or a number of days. As many libraries shifted their journal subscriptions to digital, and citation information became much more available with tools such as Google Scholar, Interlibrary Loan of articles has effectively become a large part of Interlibrary Loan services. In the context of the big deal cancellations by several library systems in the world data analysis tools like Unpaywall Journals are used by libraries to assist with big deal cancellations and to calculate whether alternative access methods like ILL and green open access end up being more effective and less expensive than a potential subscription. History Inter-library loan has an extensive history. When the king of Franks, Charlemagne completed his conquering of Western Europe he began a campaign for the intellectual resurgence. Specifically, clerics under Charlemagne‚Äôs command became teachers in topics like grammar and music. Coincidentally, this change led to the need for copied materials to provide students for their studies. History witnesses another era where books are being collected for individuals and public areas alike. During this book demand comes the aspect of inter-library loan. Monastic libraries began to loan materials out ‚Äúas long as something of equal value was left . . . to guarantee the title‚Äôs timely return‚Äù as quoted in The Library: An Illustrated History. While the borrowers during this time were usually the higher class of individuals, this practice is still used today in many library systems all over the world. The difference now is that anyone can submit an inter-library loan request. =United States = Joseph C. Rowell In 1886 Joseph C. Rowell, Librarian at the University of California, Berkeley, sought permission to begin Interlibrary Loan; his request was granted during the years 1894‚Äì1898. In 1894 Rowell initiated U.C. Berkeley's first program of interlibrary lending, with the California State Library as partner. Later that year Rowell expanded the invitation for a group of libraries, such as NUCMC. Librarians then filled out a standardized form (i.e. an ALA Interlibrary Loan Request Form 2002) and sent it by postal mail to a library that owned a copy. This procedure is still used by the few libraries that are not members of an electronic interlibrary loan network. In 1994, the Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) of the ALA (America Library Association) formed an ALA Interlibrary Loan Code for the United States, which sought to establish resource sharing as a core service and to provide guidelines for libraries. The RUSA section on Resource Sharing has also engaged in initiatives to expand resource sharing, including the Rethinking Resource Sharing Initiative and Committee. Since the mid-1980s, searching for books located at other libraries has become easier, as many libraries have enabled their users to search their online catalogs at the library or over the Internet. Today, everyone can freely use WorldCat.org to identify which needed items that are not owned by their local libraries. Medical libraries primarily use DOCLINE, developed by the National Library of Medicine, which comprises libraries in the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. The Ohio State University and others in Ohio began integrating campus library systems at an early date. In the 1960s, state funds supported the development of the Ohio College Library Center (now the Online Computer Library Center). OCLC has since grown into an international organization with a database of 30 million entries representing materials held in more than 10,000 libraries. Link+ is an interlibrary loan scheme in California and Nevada, and OhioLINK is the system used in Ohio, where the catalogs and databases of the state's libraries are joined electronically. Resource sharing networks Libraries have established voluntary associations, often on a regional basis, to provide an online union catalog of all the items held by all member libraries. Whenever a library adds a new title to its catalog, a copy of the record is also added to the union list. This allows librarians to quickly determine which of the other libraries hold an item. Software then facilitates the request and supply tasks. In the U.S., Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) is used by public and academic libraries. Formerly, another network RLIN (Research Libraries Information Network) was used primarily by academic libraries but merged with OCLC on October 1, 2007. Australia and New Zealand use Libraries Australia and New Zealand Libraries' CatalogueNew Zealand Libraries' Catalogue. National Library of New Zealand. respectively, the national bibliographic networks of those countries. Online requests are usually submitted via OCLC's WorldCat or FirstSearch in the United States. Libraries without access to either can participate in interlibrary loan by submitting requests by postal mail, fax, email, or telephone call. These are referred to as manual requests. Manual requests can be submitted in the United States through the American Library Association. Some libraries establish reciprocal arrangements with each other to supply loans and copies for free. Examples of such arrangements in the United States include Libraries Very Interested in Sharing (LVIS), Amigos, Mid-America Association of Law Libraries (MAALL), Bibliographical Center for Research, and the Greater Western Library Alliance (formerly the Big 12 Plus Library Consortium). Sometimes these arrangements include other services such as the Trans-Amigos Express (TAE) courier services, which will ship and deliver items to Amigos members on the TAE route. Individual libraries can agree to reciprocal arrangements between each other. See also * Electronic funds transfer * Fair use doctrine ReferencesFurther reading * Boucher, Virginia.

The strait between Tierra del Fuego and Isla de los Estados was named the Le Maire Strait in his honor, though not without controversy. It was Le Maire himself who proposed to the council aboard Eendracht that the new passage should be called by his name and the council unanimously agreed with Le Maire.

Biography Jacob Le Maire was born in either Antwerp or Amsterdam, one of the 22 children of Maria Walraven of Antwerp and Isaac Le Maire (1558‚Äì1624) of Tournai, who was then already a prosperous merchant in Antwerp. Isaac and Maria married shortly before the Spanish siege of Antwerp in 1585 after which they fled to settle in Amsterdam. Jacob is thought to have been the oldest son, born perhaps the same year. Isaac was very successful in Amsterdam, and became one of the founders of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC). However, in 1605 Isaac Le Maire was forced to leave the company after a dispute and for the next decade tried to break the company's monopoly on the trade to the East Indies. By 1615 Isaac had established a new company (the Australian Company) with the goal to find a new route to the Pacific and the Spice Islands, thereby evading the restrictions of the VOC. He contributed to the outfitting of two ships, the Eendracht and Hoorn, and put his son Jacob in charge of trading during the expedition.\\"chiefe Marchant and principall factor\\" The experienced ship master Willem Schouten was captain of the Eendracht and a participant of the enterprise in equal shares with Isaac Le Maire.THE RELATION, The Preface On 14 June 1615 Jacob le Maire and Willem Schouten sailed from Texel in the United Provinces. On 29 January 1616 they rounded Cape Horn, which they named for the Hoorn, which was lost in a fire. The Dutch city of Hoorn was also the birthplace of Schouten. After failing to moor at the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands in early March, the ships crossed the Pacific in a fairly straight line, visiting several of the Tuamotus. Between 21 and 24 April 1616 they were the first Westerners to visit the (Northern) Tonga islands: \\"Cocos Island\\" (Tafahi), \\"Traitors Island\\" (Niuatoputapu), and \\"Island of Good Hope\\" (Niuafo'ou). On 28 April they discovered the Hoorn Islands (Futuna and Alofi), where they were very well received and stayed until 12 May. They then followed the north coasts of New Ireland and New Guinea and visited adjacent islands, including, on 24 July, what became known as the Schouten Islands. They reached the Northern Moluccas in August and finally Ternate, the headquarters of the VOC, on 12 September 1616. Here they were enthusiastically welcomed by Governor-General Laurens Reael, admiral Steven Verhagen, and the governor of Ambon, Jasper Jansz. The Eendracht sailed on to Java and reached Batavia on 28 October with a remarkable 84 of the original 87 crew members of both ships on board. Although they had opened an unknown route, Jan Pietersz Coen of the VOC claimed infringement of its monopoly of trade to the Spice Islands. Le Maire and Schouten were arrested and the Eendracht was confiscated. After being released, they returned from Batavia to Amsterdam in the company of Joris van Spilbergen, who was on a circumnavigation of the earth himself, be it via the traditional Strait of Magellan. Le Maire was aboard the ship Amsterdam on this journey home, but died en route. Van Spilbergen was at his deathbed and took Le Maire's report of his trip, which he included in his book Mirror of the East and West Indies. The rest of the crew arrived in the Netherlands on 1 July 1617, two years and 17 days after they departed. Jacob's father Isaac challenged the confiscation and the conclusion of the VOC, but it took him until 1622 until a court ruled in his favor. He was awarded 64,000 pounds and retrieved his son's diaries (which he then published as well), and his company was allowed trade via the newly discovered route. Unfortunately, by then, the Dutch West Indies Company had claimed the same waters. FootnotesReferences * Dirk J.

University of Michigan Museum of Art Jacques Villon (July 31, 1875 - June 9, 1963), also known as Gaston Duchamp, was a French Cubist and abstract painter and printmaker. Early life Born Emile M√©ry Fr√©d√©ric Gaston DuchampArchives nationales de France, Base de donn√©es L√©onore in Damville, Eure, in Normandy, France, he came from a prosperous and artistically inclined family. While he was a young man, his maternal grandfather Emile Nicolle, a successful businessman and artist, educated Villon and his siblings.

Walt Kuhn scrapbook of press clippings documenting the Armory Show, vol. 1, 1913. To distinguish himself from his siblings, Gaston Duchamp adopted the pseudonym of Jacques Villon as a tribute to the French medieval poet Fran√ßois Villon. In Montmartre, home to an expanding art community, Villon lost interest in the pursuit of a legal career, and for the next 10 years he worked in graphic media, contributing cartoons and illustrations to Parisian newspapers as well as drawing color posters. His work appeared in the satirical weekly Le Courrier fran√ßais.Le Courrier fran√ßais (Paris. 1884-1914), Biblioth√®que nationale de France In 1903 he helped organize the drawing section of the first Salon d'Automne in Paris.Salon d'automne; Soci√©t√© du Salon d'automne, Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art d√©coratif. Expos√©s au Petit Palais des Champs-√âlys√©es, 1903 In 1904-1905 he studied art at the Acad√©mie Julian. At first, he was influenced by Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, but later he participated in the fauvist, Cubist, and abstract impressionist movements. By 1906, Montmartre was a bustling community and Jacques Villon moved to Puteaux in the quiet outskirts of Paris. There, he began to devote more of his time to working in drypoint, an intaglio technique that creates dark, velvety lines that stand out against the white of the paper. During this time he worked closely to develop his technique with other important printmakers such as Manuel Robbe. His isolation from the vibrant art community in Montmartre, together with his modest nature, ensured that he and his artwork remained obscure for a number of years.

Walter Pach papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution In 1913, Villon created seven large drypoints in which forms break into shaded pyramidal planes. That year, he exhibited at the Armory Show in New York City, helping introduce European modern art to the United States. His works proved popular and all his art sold. From there, his reputation expanded so that by the 1930s he was better known in the United States than in Europe.Laurette E. McCarthy, Walter Pach, Walter Pach (1883‚Äì1958), The Armory Show and the Untold Story of Modern Art in America, Penn State Press, 2011 Honors Saint-Stephen Cathedral in Metz. An exhibition of Jacques Villon's work was held in Paris in 1944 at the Galerie Louis Carr√©, following which he received honors at a number of international exhibitions. In 1938 he was named Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion of Honor. In 1947 he was promoted to Officier (Officer) of the Legion of Honor. In 1950, Villon received the Carnegie Prize, the highest award for painting in the world, and in 1954 he was made a Commandeur (Commander) of the Legion of Honor. The following year he was commissioned to design stained- glass windows for the cathedral at Metz, France. In 1956 he was awarded the Grand Prix at the Venice Biennale exhibition. Among Villon's greatest achievements as a printmaker was his creation of a purely graphic language for cubism ‚Äì an accomplishment that no other printmaker, including his fellow cubists Pablo Picasso or Georges Braque, could claim. Villon died in his studio at Puteaux. In 1967, in Rouen, his last surviving artist brother Marcel helped organize an exhibition called Les Duchamp: Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Marcel Duchamp, Suzanne Duchamp. Some of this family exhibition was later shown at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris. Many important museums include works by Villon in their collections, including the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; Minneapolis Institute of Arts; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Art Institute of Chicago; Columbus Museum of Art (Columbus, Ohio); Museum of Modern Art, New York City; University of Michigan Museum of Art (Ann Arbor, Michigan); National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.; Art Gallery of New South Wales (Sydney, Australia); Biblioth√®que Nationale, Paris; and Mus√©e Jenisch (Vevey, Switzerland). Leading private collections which include the works of Villon are the Joachim Collection of Chicago, the Vess Collection of Detroit, and the Ginestet Collection of Paris.

Emerging from the new wave scene in the late 1970s, the line-up consisted of singer, rhythm guitarist and songwriter Ric Ocasek, bassist and singer Benjamin Orr, lead guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront of merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and flourishing in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style: \\"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends‚Äîpunk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop‚Äîand mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\\" Palmer, Robert. \\"Pop: Cars Merge Styles\\" The New York Times August 9, 1978: C17 The Cars were named Best New Artist in the 1978 Rolling Stone Readers' Poll and won Video of the Year for \\"You Might Think\\" at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. Their debut album The Cars sold six million copies and appeared on the Billboard 200 album chart for 139 weeks. As of 2001, the Cars had sold over 23 million albums in the United States. The band disbanded in 1988 and Ocasek stated that a reunion would never happen.\\"Life after the Cars\\" The Cincinnati Post October 11, 1997: 16A Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes joined with Todd Rundgren to form the spin-off band the New Cars, which performed classic Cars and Rundgren songs along with new material. The surviving original members reunited in 2010 to record the album Move Like This, which was released in May 2011, followed by a short tour.The Cars Reunite for First Album in 23 Years Billboard October 21, 2010 In April 2018, the Cars were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and reunited to perform at the induction ceremony. The reunion was their final performance with Ocasek, who died on September 15, 2019 of cardiovascular disease. History=Early years= Before the Cars, members of the band performed together in several different groups. Ric Ocasek and Benjamin Orr met in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1960s after Ocasek saw Orr performing with his band the Grasshoppers on the Big 5 Show, a local musical variety program. The two were in various bands in Columbus, Ohio and Ann Arbor, Michigan, then moved to Boston in the early 1970s. In Boston, Ocasek and Orr, along with lead guitarist Jas Goodkind, formed a Crosby, Stills and Nash-style folk rock band called Milkwood. In 1973, they released one album, How's the Weather, on Paramount Records, that failed to chart. After Milkwood, Ocasek and Orr formed the group Richard and the Rabbits, whose name was suggested by Jonathan Richman. The band included Greg Hawkes, who had studied at the Berklee School of Music and had played saxophone on Milkwood's album. Hawkes left to tour with Martin Mull and His Fabulous Furniture, a musical comedy act in which Mull played a variety of instruments. Ric Ocasek and Ben Orr then performed as an acoustic duo called simply Ocasek and Orr at the Idler coffeehouse in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Some of the songs they played became the early Cars songs. Later, Ocasek and Orr teamed with guitarist Elliot Easton (who had also studied at Berklee) in the band Cap'n Swing. Cap'n Swing also featured drummer Glenn Evans, later followed by Kevin Robichaud, and a jazzy bass player, which clashed with Ocasek's more rock-and-roll leanings. Benjamin Orr was the lead vocalist and did not play an instrument. Cap'n Swing soon came to the attention of WBCN disc jockey Maxanne Sartori, who began playing songs from their demo tape on her show. After being rejected by several record labels, Ocasek got rid of the bass player and drummer and decided to form a band that better fit his style of writing. Orr took over on bass and Robichaud was replaced by David Robinson, best known for his career with the Modern Lovers. Robinson had also played in DMZ and the Pop! Hawkes returned to play keyboards and the band became \\"The Cars\\", a name suggested by Robinson, whose sense of fashion had a strong influence on the band's image. =Rise in popularity, The Cars, and Candy-O (1978‚Äì1979)= The Cars played their first show at Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire on December 31, 1976, and spent early 1977 playing throughout New England, developing the songs that appeared on their debut album. A nine-song demo tape was recorded in early 1977 and soon \\"Just What I Needed\\" was getting heavy airplay on Boston radio stations WBCN and WCOZ.Carter Alan. Radio Free Boston: The Rise and Fall of WBCN. . Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2013, p. 109. By virtue of that airplay, the band was offered record deals from Arista Records and Elektra Records. The band signed to Elektra, due to its lack of new wave acts, allowing the band to stand out more compared to Arista which had many new wave artists. The band's debut album The Cars was released in June 1978, reaching No. 18 on the Billboard 200. \\"Just What I Needed\\" was released as the debut single from the album, followed by \\"My Best Friend's Girl\\" and \\"Good Times Roll\\", all three charting on the Billboard Hot 100. The album featured multiple album tracks that received substantial airplay, such as \\"You're All I've Got Tonight\\", \\"Bye Bye Love\\", and \\"Moving in Stereo\\". The band's second album Candy-O was released in June 1979. Featuring an album cover created by the famed Playboy artist Alberto Vargas, the album reached No. 3 on the Billboard chart. It featured their first Top-20 single \\"Let's Go\\". Follow-up singles \\"It's All I Can Do\\" and \\"Double Life\\" also were released, but with less success. =Change in sound, Panorama, and Shake It Up (1980‚Äì1983)= Following the success of Candy-O, the band's third studio album Panorama was released in 1980. The album, considered more experimental than its predecessors, featured only one top-40 hit with \\"Touch and Go\\". Although the album peaked at No. 5 in America, it did not receive the critical praise of The Cars and Candy-O, with Rolling Stone describing the album as \\"an out-and-out drag\\". In 1981, the Cars purchased Intermedia Studios in Boston, renaming it Syncro Sound.Morse, Steve. \\"Boston's Music Scene: A Hotbed of Rock and Roll\\" Boston Globe June 5, 1981 The only Cars album recorded there was the band's fourth album Shake It Up, a more commercial album than Panorama. It was their first album to spawn a top-10 single with the title track, and it included another hit in \\"Since You're Gone\\". Following their 1982 tour, the Cars took a short break and went to work on solo projects, with Ocasek and Hawkes both releasing debut albums (Beatitude and Niagara Falls, respectively). =Heartbeat City, Door to Door and first hiatus (1984‚Äì1988)= The Cars reunited and released their most successful album, Heartbeat City, in 1984. The first single, \\"You Might Think\\", helped the Cars win Video of the Year at the first MTV Video Music Awards. Other hit singles from the album included \\"Magic\\", \\"Hello Again\\", and \\"Why Can't I Have You\\". \\"Drive\\", their most successful single, with Orr on lead vocals, gained particular notability when it was used in a video of the [Ethiopian famine prepared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and introduced by David Bowie at the 1985 Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London (the Cars themselves performed in the Philadelphia Live Aid concert). Actor/director Timothy Hutton directed the band's 1984 \\"Drive\\" music video. After the resulting period of superstardom and another hit single, \\"Tonight She Comes\\", a No. 7 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 and a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart (their last No. 1), from their Greatest Hits, the Cars took time off again to pursue solo projects. Easton and Orr released their debut albums (Change No Change and The Lace, respectively), while Ocasek released his second solo album, This Side of Paradise. In 1987, the Cars released their sixth album, Door to Door. It contained their last major international hit \\"You Are the Girl\\", but the album failed to approach the success of their previous albums. The group announced their breakup in February 1988. =Post break-up, solo careers and Benjamin Orr's death (1989‚Äì2009)= In the late 1990s, rumors circulated of a Cars reunion, with nothing to follow after them. However, in 1995 Rhino Records released a two-CD set Just What I Needed: The Cars Anthology, containing all the group's hits mixed with rarities (demos and non-album B-sides). They followed up with the releases of The Cars: Deluxe Edition (1999), their debut album in a two-CD format, and Complete Greatest Hits. In the mid-1990s, Orr recorded tracks with guitarist John Kalishes for an unreleased follow-up to The Lace and performed with three bands: his own band ORR, the Voices of Classic Rock, and Big People. Orr did appear with his former band mates one last time in an interview for a documentary about the group before his death from pancreatic cancer at age 53 in 2000. Ocasek continued to perform as a solo artist, having released over seven studio albums. Robinson retired from music and spent most of his time working in his restaurant. In 2005, Easton and Hawkes combined their talents with Todd Rundgren, Prairie Prince (the Tubes, Journey), and Kasim Sulton (Utopia, Meat Loaf) in a revamped lineup, the New Cars, to perform classic Cars songs along with some new original material and selections from Rundgren's career. In 2008, the band's first album was released for the video game Rock Band. =Reunion, Move Like This and second hiatus (2010‚Äì2017)= In 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, in Millbrook, New York, on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, \\"Blue Tip\\", on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album. In October Billboard reported that a new album which might be supported by a tour was being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of the new song \\"Sad Song\\" was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called \\"Free\\" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for \\"Blue Tip\\" was released February 17. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band and NYC-based street artist Joe Iurato. According to Rolling Stone, the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts. The new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboards album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. \\"Sad Song\\" was released to radio stations on March 1 as the album's first single. In May 2011, the Cars went on a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August. On the tour, Orr's bass parts were performed by Hawkes on keyboard and bass; the vocals on songs originally sung by Orr (\\"Just What I Needed\\", \\"Let's Go\\" and \\"Moving in Stereo\\") were performed by Ocasek. In an interview, Ocasek was asked whether the band would have reunited if Ben Orr had still been alive. Ocasek responded \\"Ben and I had a real cold war going that lasted about 23 years. I could never really figure out exactly why, but I think there was a lot of jealousy because I wrote the songs and I got a lot of attention. And there was all kinds of weird stuff, like he said, 'My girlfriend writes songs, let's use one of those or two of those.' I said, 'No, that's not the Cars.'\\" The Cars once again became inactive after the tour's conclusion in 2011. On April 28, 2016, Ric Ocasek appeared on behalf of the Cars for a Q&A; with SiriusXM satellite radio. 2016 also saw a release of remastered Cars music on CD and vinyl. Ocasek supervised the remastering. =Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction and death of Ric Ocasek (2018‚Äì2019)= After seven years of inactivity, the group reconvened, along with Weezer's Scott Shriner on bass in Orr's stead, to play a four-song set (\\"You Might Think\\", \\"My Best Friend's Girl\\", \\"Moving in Stereo\\", \\"Just What I Needed\\") at their 2018 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. On September 15, 2019, NBC New York reported that Ocasek was found dead in his home in New York at the age of 75. Musical style The Cars' music has been described as new wave and power pop, and is influenced by proto-punk, garage rock, and bubblegum pop. They have also used rockabilly in songs such as \\"My Best Friend's Girl\\".Moore, Allan F. (2003). Analyzing Popular Music. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. pp. 188‚Äì190. . Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style: \\"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends‚Äîpunk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the 1950s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop‚Äîand mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\\" They have also written and recorded hard rock- oriented songs including \\"You're All I've Got Tonight\\".

Such conspiracy theories commonly argue that Earth governments, especially the Government of the United States, are in communication or cooperation with extraterrestrials despite public claims to the contrary, and further that some of these theories claim that the governments are explicitly allowing alien abduction.Paul Harris: Cold War hysteria sparked UFO obsession, study finds Various UFO conspiracy ideas have flourished on the internet and were frequently featured on Art Bell's program, Coast to Coast AM.Genoni Jr., Thomas C., Peddling the Paranormal: Late-Night Radio's Art Bell, Skeptical Briefs, Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, volume 8, issue #1, March 1998 http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/peddling_the_paranormal_late- night_radios_art_bell/ Individuals who have publicly stated that UFO evidence is being suppressed include Senator Barry Goldwater, British Admiral Lord Hill-Norton (former NATO head and chief of the British Defence Staff), Vice Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (first CIA director), astronauts Gordon Cooper and Edgar Mitchell, and former Canadian Defence Minister Paul Hellyer. Beyond their testimonies and reports they have presented no evidence to substantiate their statements and claims. According to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry little or no evidence exists to support them despite significant research on the subject by non-governmental scientific agencies.CSI  UFOs and Aliens in Space Chronology=1930s= On the night before Halloween in 1938, Orson Welles directed The Mercury Theatre on the Air live radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel, The War of the Worlds (serialized in 1897). By mimicking a news broadcast, the show was quite realistic sounding for its time, and some listeners were fooled into thinking that a Martian invasion was underway in the United States. Widespread confusion was followed by outrage and controversy. Some later studies have argued that the contemporary press exaggerated the extent of the panic, but it remains clear that many people were caught up, to some degree, in the confusion. In other countries, reactions were similar. In 1949, part of the script for The War of the Worlds was read out over the radio in Quito, Ecuador, without announcement, as if it were a major piece of breaking news. Huge crowds of people emerged onto the streets and sought refuge inside churches with their families. When the radio station was informed of this, its announcers broadcast the fact that no invasion was happening. An angry mob formed and burned the station to the ground, causing between six and twenty deaths. Many other countries also experienced problems when broadcasting The War of the Worlds. According to U.S. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt,Ruppelt: Roswell UFO Cover the Air Force's files often mentioned the panicked aftermath of the 1938 War of the Worlds broadcast as a possible reaction of the public to confirmed evidence of UFOs; however, the files have not been made available to corroborate his assertions. =1940s= Donald Keyhoe later began investigating flying saucers for True magazine. Keyhoe was one of the first significant conspiracy theorists, asserting eventually that the saucers were from outer space and were on some sort of scouting mission. Keyhoe claimed to derive his theory from his contacts in Air Force and Navy intelligence. Project Sign, based at Air Technical Intelligence Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and its successors Project Grudge and Project Blue Book were officially assigned to investigate the flying saucers. Edward Ruppelt's book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects,The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, Doubleday Books reports that many people within these research groups did in fact support the hypothesis that the flying saucers were from outer space. Keyhoe later founded NICAP, a civilian investigation group that asserted the U.S. government was lying about UFOs and covering up information that should be shared with the public. NICAP had many influential board members, including Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter, the first director of the CIA. To date no substantiating evidence for NICAP's assertions has been presented beyond accounts that are anecdotal and documented hear-say or rumor. The Great Los Angeles Air Raid \\"The Great Los Angeles Air Raid\\" also known as \\"The Battle of Los Angeles\\" is the name given by contemporary sources to the imaginary enemy attack and subsequent anti-aircraft artillery barrage which took place from late February 24 to early February 25, 1942 over Los Angeles, California. Initially, the target of the aerial barrage was thought to be an attacking force from Japan, but Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox speaking at a press conference shortly afterward called the incident a \\"false alarm.\\" A small number of modern-day UFOlogists have suggested the reported targets were extraterrestrial spacecraft.Documents Dated Prior to 1948 The Majestic Documents When documenting the incident in 1983, the U.S. Office of Air Force History attributed the event to a case of \\"war nerves\\" likely triggered by a lost weather balloon and exacerbated by stray flares and shell bursts from adjoining batteries.San Francisco virtual museum article Ghost rockets In 1946 and 1947, numerous reports occurred of so-called ghost rockets appearing over Scandinavian countries, primarily Sweden, which then spread into other European countries.Ghost Rockets: * Timothy Good, Above Top Secret, 1988, William Morrow & Co., * Timothy Good, Need to Know: UFOs, the Military, and Intelligence, 2007, Pegasus Books, * Donald Keyhoe, Aliens From Space, 1973, Doubleday & Co., * Jenny Randles, UFO Retrievals: The Recovery of Alien Spacecraft, 1985, Blandford Press, * Reuben Stone, Alien Worlds, 1993, Longmeadow Press, (Contains photo of search for ghost rocket seen crashing in Lake K√∂lmj√§rv) One USAF top secret document from 1948 stated that Swedish Air Force Intelligence informed them that some of their investigators felt that the reported objects were not only real but could not be explained as having earthly origins. Similarly, 20 years later, Greek physicist Dr. Paul Santorini publicly stated that in 1947 he was put in charge of a Greek military investigation into reports of ghost rockets sighted over Greece [ Timothy Good 1988, p 23; Donald Keyhoe, p 142]. Again, they quickly concluded the objects were real and not of conventional origin. Santorini claimed their investigation was killed by U.S. scientists and high military officials who had already concluded the objects were extraterrestrial in origin and feared public panic because no defense existed.Ghost Rockets: list of External links to sources. Roswell Incident In 1947, the United States Air Force issued a press release stating that a \\"flying disk\\" had been recovered near Roswell, New Mexico. This press release was quickly withdrawn, and officials stated that a weather balloon had been misidentified. The Roswell case quickly faded even from the attention of most UFOlogists until the 1970s. Speculation persisted despite the official denial that an alien spacecraft crashed near Roswell. In the 1990s, the US military published two reports disclosing the true nature of the crashed aircraft: a surveillance balloon from Project Mogul. Nevertheless, the Roswell incident continues to be of interest to the media, and conspiracy theories surrounding the event persist. Roswell has been described as \\"the world's most famous, most exhaustively investigated and most thoroughly debunked UFO claim\\". Mantell Incident In 1948, Air Force pilot Thomas Mantell was killed in a crash while pursuing what he described as \\"a metallic object...of tremendous size\\".Clark, Jerome, The UFO Book: Encyclopedia of the Extraterrestrial, Visible Ink, 1998 Project Blue Book concluded that Mantell had lost control of his aircraft while chasing a then- classified Skyhook balloon. Some UFOlogists reject Bluebook's conclusion because of its initial suggestion that Mantell was chasing \\"Venus or a comet\\". Project Sign The U.S. Air Force may have planted the seeds of UFO conspiracy theories with Project Sign (established 1947) (which became Project Grudge and Project Blue Book). Edward J. Ruppelt, the first director of Blue Book, characterized the Air Force's public behavior regarding UFOs as \\"schizophrenic\\": alternately open and transparent, then secretive and dismissive. Ruppelt also revealed that in mid-1948, Project Sign issued a top secret Estimate of the Situation concluding that the flying saucers were not only real but probably extraterrestrial in origin. According to Ruppelt, the Estimate was ordered destroyed by Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg. Project Sign's final report, published in early 1949, stated that while some UFOs appeared to represent actual aircraft, data were insufficient to determine their origin.Blum, Howard, Out There: The Government's Secret Quest for Extraterrestrials. Simon and Schuster, 1990 Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Some UFOlogists have claimed the existence of a U.S. government group called the \\"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit\\" allegedly established by General Douglas MacArthur that was \\"supposedly formed to investigate crashed and retrieved flying saucers\\".Stephen J. Spignesi. The Ufo Book of Lists. Citadel Press; 2000. . p. 24‚Äì. =1950s= The 1950s saw an increase in both governmental and civilian investigative efforts and reports of public disinformation and suppression of evidence. The UK Ministry of Defence‚Äôs UFO Project has its roots in a study commissioned in 1950 by the MOD‚Äôs then Chief Scientific Adviser, the great radar scientist Sir Henry Tizard. As a result of his insistence that UFO sightings should not be dismissed without some form of proper scientific study, the Department set up the Flying Saucer Working Party (or FSWP).Nick Pope, UFOs: An Official History. In August 1950, Montanan baseball manager Nicholas Mariana filmed several UFOs with his color 16mm camera. Project Blue Book was called in and, after inspecting the film, Mariana claimed it was returned to him with critical footage removed, clearly showing the objects as disc-shaped. The incident sparked nationwide media attention. Frank Scully's 1950 Behind the Flying Saucers suggested that the U.S. government had recovered a crashed flying saucer and its dead occupants near Aztec, New Mexico, in 1948. It was later revealed that Scully had been the victim of a prank by \\"two veteran confidence artists\\".J. P. Cahn expos√©, True Magazine, 1952. Donald Keyhoe was a retired U.S. Marine who wrote a series of popular books and magazine articles that were very influential in shaping public opinion, arguing that UFOs were indeed real and that the U.S. government was suppressing UFO evidence. Keyhoe's first article on the subject came out in True magazine, January 1950, and was a national sensation. His first book, Flying Saucers Are Real also came out in 1950, about the same time as Frank Scully's book, and was a bestseller. In 1956, Keyhoe helped establish NICAP, a powerful civilian UFO investigating group with many inside sources. Keyhoe became its director and continued his attacks on the Air Force. Other contemporary critics also charged that the United States Air Force was perpetrating a cover-up with its Project Blue Book. Canadian radio engineer Wilbert B. Smith, who worked for the Canadian Department of Transport, was interested in flying saucer propulsion technology and wondered if the assertions in the just-published Scully and Keyhoe books were factual. In September 1950, he had the Canadian embassy in Washington D.C. arrange contact with U.S. officials to try to discover the truth of the matter. Smith was briefed by Dr. Robert Sarbacher, a physicist and consultant to the Defense Department's Research and Development Board. Other correspondence, having to do with Keyhoe needing to get clearance to publish another article on Smith's theories of UFO propulsion, indicated that Bush and his group were operating out of the Research and Development Board.Roswell Proof: Smith Papers Smith then briefed superiors in the Canadian government, leading to the establishment of Project Magnet, a small Canadian government UFO research effort. Canadian documents and Smith's private papers were uncovered in the late 1970s, and by 1984, other alleged documents emerged claiming the existence of a highly secret UFO oversight committee of scientists and military people called Majestic 12, again naming Vannevar Bush. Sarbacher was also interviewed in the 1980s and corroborated the information in Smith's memos and correspondence. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Smith granted public interviews, and among other things stated that he had been lent crashed UFO material for analysis by a highly secret U.S. government group which he wouldn't name.Presidential UFO.com Roswell Proof.com A few weeks after the Robertson Panel, the Air Force issued Regulation 200-2, ordering air base officers to publicly discuss UFO incidents only if they were judged to have been solved, and to classify all the unsolved cases to keep them out of the public eye. In addition, UFO investigative duties started to be taken on by the newly formed 4602nd Air Intelligence Squadron (AISS) of the Air Defense Command. The 4602nd AISS was tasked with investigating only the most important UFO cases having intelligence or national security implications. These were deliberately siphoned away from Blue Book, leaving Blue Book to deal with the more trivial reports. In 1954 an automatic working station for UFO monitoring was installed at Shirley's Bay near Ottawa in Canada. After this station detected the first suspicious event, all data gained by this station was classified as secret, although the cameras of the monitoring station could not make any pictures because of fog.Canada's UFOs, Shirley's Bay, Ontario, Project Magnet, 1952, Library and Archives of Canada. 1956 saw the publication of Gray Barker's They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers, the book which publicized the idea of sinister Men in Black who appear to UFO witnesses and warn them to keep quiet. There has been continued speculation that the men in black are government agents who harass and threaten UFO witnesses. Also in 1956, the group Foundation for Earth-Space Relations, led by film producer Tzadi Sophit, tested their own flying saucer outside the Long Island town of Ridge Landing. It is speculated in Robertson's The Long Island Saucer that an FBI cover-up silenced witnesses. On January 22, 1958, when Donald Keyhoe appeared on CBS television, his statements on UFOs were censored by the Air Force. During the show when Keyhoe tried to depart from the censored script to \\"reveal something that has never been disclosed before\\", CBS cut the sound, later stating Keyhoe was about to violate \\"predetermined security standards\\" and about to say something he wasn't \\"authorized to release\\". What Keyhoe was about to reveal were four publicly unknown military studies concluding UFOs were interplanetary including the 1948 Project Sign Estimate of the Situation and a 1952 Project Blue Book engineering analysis of UFO motion presented at the Robertson Panel. Astronaut Gordon Cooper reported suppression of a flying saucer movie filmed in high clarity by two Edwards AFB range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by James McDonald, the photographers and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor the photographers ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that the photographers had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air. =1960s= Throughout much of the 1960s, atmospheric physicist James E. McDonald suggested‚Äîvia lectures, articles and letters‚Äîthat the U.S. Government was mishandling evidence that would support the extraterrestrial hypothesis.see James E. McDonald: External links. Vallee and the \\"Pentacle Memorandum\\" In June 1967, researcher Jacques Vallee was tasked with organizing files collected by Project Bluebook investigator J. Allen Hynek Jacque Vallee, Forbidden ScienceThe Phenomenon (2020) Among those files, Vallee found a memo dated 9 January 1953 addressed an assistant of Edward J. Ruppelt, an Air Force officer assigned to Bluebook. The memo was signed \\"H.C. Cross\\", but Vallee elected to refer to the author under the pseudonym \\"Pentacle\\". The memo referred to a previously-unknown analysis of several thousand UFO reports, along with calls for agreements about \\"what can and what cannot be discussed\\" with the 1953 Roberson Panel. Writing in his 1967 journal, Vallee expressed the opinion that the memo, if it were published, \\"would cause an even bigger uproar among foreign scientists than among Americans: it would prove the devious nature of the statements made by the Pentagon all these years about the non-existence of UFOs\\". =1970s= Jerome Clark comments that many UFO conspiracy theory tales \\"can be traced to a mock documentary Alternative 3, broadcast on British television on June 20, 1977 (but intended for April Fools' Day), and subsequently turned into a paperback book.\\"Clark The UFO Book, p. 213‚Äì14 Holloman Air Force Base Clark cites a 1973 encounter as perhaps the earliest suggestion that the U.S. government was involved with ETs. That year, Robert Emenegger and Allan Sandler of Los Angeles, California were in contact with officials at Norton Air Force Base in order to make a documentary film. Emenegger and Sandler report that Air Force Officials (including Paul Shartle) suggested incorporating UFO information in the documentary, including as its centerpiece genuine footage of a 1971 UFO landing at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. Furthermore, says Emenegger, he was given a tour of Holloman AFB and was shown where officials conferred with Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs). This was supposedly not the first time the U.S. had met these aliens, as Emenegger reported that his U.S. military sources had \\"been monitoring signals from an alien group with which they were unfamiliar, and did their ET guests know anything about them? The ETs said no\\" Clark The UFO Book, p. 144 The documentary was released in 1974 as UFO's: Past, Present and Future (narrated by Rod Serling) containing only a few seconds of the Holloman UFO footage, the remainder of the landing depicted with illustrations and re- enactments. In 1988, Shartle said that the film in question was genuine, and that he had seen it several times. In 1976 a televised documentary report UFOS: It Has BegunUFOS: It Has Begun, Producer Allan F.

Some sequences were recreated based upon the statements of eyewitness observers, together with the findings and conclusions of governmental civil and military investigations. The documentary uses a hypothetical UFO landing at Holloman AFB as a backdrop. Paul Bennewitz The late 1970s also saw the beginning of controversy centered on Paul Bennewitz of Albuquerque, New Mexico.see Paul Bennewitz: References and External Links. =1980s=MJ-12 The so-called Majestic 12 documents surfaced in 1982, suggesting that there was secret, high-level U.S. government interest in UFOs dating to the 1940s. Upon examination, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declared the documents to be \\"completely bogus\\", and many ufologists consider them to be an elaborate hoax. Linda Moulton Howe Linda Moulton Howe is an advocate of conspiracy theories that cattle mutilations are of extraterrestrial origin and speculations that the U.S. government is involved with aliens. Milton William Cooper In the 1980s, Milton William Cooper achieved a degree of prominence due to his conspiratorial writings.see Milton William Cooper: References. Bob Lazar In November 1989, Bob Lazar appeared in a special interview with investigative reporter George Knapp on Las Vegas TV station KLAS to discuss his alleged employment at S-4.KLAS-TV: 8 News Now: George Knapp, Investigative Reporter: \\"Bob Lazar The Man Behind Area 51: NEW: Area 51 Exposed retrieved 21 March 2013 In his interview with Knapp, Lazar said he first thought the saucers were secret, terrestrial aircraft, whose test flights must have been responsible for many UFO reports. Gradually, on closer examination and from having been shown multiple briefing documents, Lazar came to the conclusion that the discs must have been of extraterrestrial origin. He claims that they use moscovium, an element that decays in a fraction of a second, to warp space, and that ‚ÄúGrey‚Äù aliens are from the Zeta Reticuli star system. According to the Los Angeles Times, he never obtained the degrees he claims to hold from MIT and Caltech.Los Angeles Times: May 6, 1993, Rivenberg, Ray, \\"Unusually Fanatical Observers Ike Struck Deal With Aliens!\\"The Presidents UFO Website: The True Story of Area 51: A Look at the Actual Evidence, Written by Grant Cameron, Monday, 03 October 2011 18:29 retrieved 21 March 2013 UFO Cover-Up?: Live!

July 1989 MUFON Convention The Mutual UFO Network held their 1989 annual convention in Las Vegas, Nevada, on July 1, 1989. The Ufologist Bill Moore was scheduled as the main speaker, and he refused to submit his paper for review prior to the convention, and also announced that he would not answer any follow-up questions as was common practice. Unlike most of the convention's attendees, Moore did not stay at the same hotel that was hosting the convention. When he spoke, Moore said that he and others had been part of an elaborate, long-term disinformation campaign begun primarily to discredit Paul Bennewitz: \\"My role in the affair ... was primarily that of a freelancer providing information on Paul's (Bennewitz) current thinking and activities\\".Clark The UFO Book, p. 163 Air Force Sergeant Richard C. Doty was also involved, said Moore, though Moore thought Doty was \\"simply a pawn in a much larger game, as was I.\\" One of their goals, Moore said, was to disseminate information and watch as it was passed from person to person in order to study information channels. Moore said that he \\"was in a rather unique position\\" in the disinformation campaign: \\"judging by the positions of the people I knew to be directly involved in it, [the disinformation] definitely had something to do with national security. There was no way I was going to allow the opportunity to pass me by ... I would play the disinformation game, get my hands dirty just often enough to lead those directing the process into believing I was doing what they wanted me to do, and all the while continuing to burrow my way into the matrix so as to learn as much as possible about who was directing it and why.\\"Clark The UFO Book, p. 164 Once he finished the speech, Moore immediately left the hotel and Las Vegas that same night. Moore's claims sent shock waves through the small, tight-knit UFO community, which remains divided as to the reliability of his assertions. =1990s= On November 24, 1992, a UFO reportedly crashed in Southaven Park, Shirley, New York.UFO Crash At Southaven Park at www.ufocasebook.com John Ford, a Long Island MUFON researcher, investigated the crash. Four years later, on June 12, 1996, Ford was arrested and charged with plotting to poison several local politicians by sneaking radium in their toothpaste. On advice of counsel Ford pleaded insanity and was committed to the Mid Hudson Psychiatric Center. Critics say the charges are a frame-up. The Branton Files have circulated on the internet at least since the mid-1990s. They essentially recirculate the information presented above, with many asides from \\"Branton\\", the document's editor. Philip Schneider of the patriot movement, an engineer and geologist formerly working for the U.S. government, made a few appearances at UFO conventions in the 1990s, espousing essentially a new version of the theories mentioned above. He claimed to have played a role in the construction of Deep Underground Military Bases (DUMBs) across the United States, and as a result he said that he had been exposed to classified information of various sorts as well as having personal experiences with EBEs. He claimed to have survived the Dulce Base catastrophe and decided to tell his tale. He died by suicide on January 17, 1996, after a series of lectures given in late 1995 on topics including the Black Budget and underground alien bases. Others believe that Schneider did not take his own life and that he was actually murdered by the government. In 1999 a group in France published a study, \\"UFOs and Defense: What Must We Be Prepared For?\\" Among other topics, the study concluded that the United States government has withheld valuable evidence.UFO Evidence : COMETA Report at www.ufoevidence.org =2000s= 2003 saw the publication of Alien Encounters (), by Chuck Missler and Mark Eastman, which primarily re-stated the notions presented above (especially Cooper's) and presents them as fact. MoD secret files Eight files from 1978 to 1987 on UFO sightings were first released on May 14, 2008, to the National Archives' website by the British Ministry of Defence. Two hundred files were set to be made public by 2012. The files are correspondence from the public sent to government officials, such as the MoD and Margaret Thatcher. The information can be downloaded.UFO files from The National Archives at www.nationalarchives.gov.uk Copies of Lt. Col. Halt's letter regarding the sighting at RAF Woodbridge (see above) to the U.K. Ministry of Defence were routinely released (without additional comment) by the USA's base public affairs staff throughout the 1980s until the base closed. The MoD released the files due to requests under the Freedom of Information Act. The files included, among other things, alien craft flying over Liverpool and Waterloo Bridge in London.afp.google.com, The truth is out there: Britons 'spotted' UFOs, records say Disclosure In the early 2000s, the concept of \\"disclosure\\" became increasingly popular in the UFO conspiracy community: that the government had classified and withheld information on alien contact and full disclosure was needed, and was pursued by activist lobbying groups. In 1993, Steven M. Greer founded the Disclosure Project to promote the concept. In May 2001, Greer held a press conference at the National Press Club in D.C that demanded Congress hold hearings on \\"secret U.S. involvement with UFOs and extraterrestrials\\". It was described by an attending BBC reporter as \\"the strangest ever news conference hosted by Washington's august National Press Club.\\" The Disclosure Project's claims were met with by derision by skeptics and spokespeople for the U. S. Air Force. In 2013, the production company CHD2, LLC held a \\"Citizen Hearing on Disclosure\\" at the National Press Club in D.C from 29 April to 3 May 2013. The group paid former U.S. Senator Mike Gravel and former Representatives Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, Roscoe Bartlett, Merrill Cook, Darlene Hooley, and Lynn Woolsey $20,000 each to participate, and to preside over panels of academics and former government and military officials discussing UFOs and extraterrestrials. Other such groups include Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, founded in 1977. Allegations of evidence suppression Allegations of suppression of UFO related evidence have persisted for many decades. Some conspiracy theories also claim that some governments might have removed and/or destroyed/suppressed physical evidence; some examples follow. On July 7, 1947, William Rhodes photographed an unusual object over Phoenix, Arizona.Rhodes_Phoenix The photos appeared in a Phoenix newspaper and a few other papers. An Army Air Force intelligence officer and an FBI agent interviewed Rhodes on August 29 and convinced him to surrender the negatives, which he did the next day. He was informed he wouldn't get them back, but later he tried, unsuccessfully, to retrieve them.http://bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA- PBB1-913http://bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB1-920 The photos were analyzed and subsequently appeared in some classified Air Force UFO intelligence reports.

One memo suggested the FBI be used, then precluded the FBI getting involved. Another memo said \\"it would be nice if OSI could arrange to secure a copy of the film in some covert manner,\\" but if that wasn't feasible, one of the Air Force scientists might have to negotiate directly with the newspaper. In a recent interview, the photographer confirmed meeting with military intelligence and still having the film in his possession until then, but refused to say what happened to the film after that.Strange rocket-like UFO over California/Nevada, June 24, 1950 In another 1950 movie incident from Montana, Nicholas Mariana filmed some unusual aerial objects and eventually turned the film over to the U.S. Air Force, but insisted that the first part of the film, clearly showing the objects as spinning discs, had been removed when it was returned to him.Clark The UFO Book, p. 398 According to some conspiracy theorists, during the military investigation of green fireballs in New Mexico, UFOs were photographed by a tracking camera over White Sands Proving Grounds on April 27, 1949. They claim that the final report in 1951 on the green fireball investigation claimed there was insufficient data to determine anything. Conspiracy theorists claim that documents later uncovered by Dr. Bruce Maccabee indicate that triangulation was accomplished. The conspiracy theorists also claim that the data reduction and photographs showed four objects about 30 feet in diameter flying in formation at high speed at an altitude of about 30 miles. According to conspiracy theorists, Maccabee says this result was apparently suppressed from the final report.NCP-12: The White Sands Proof ‚Äì Maccabee On January 22, 1958, when NICAP director Donald Keyhoe appeared on CBS television, his statements on UFOs were censored by the Air Force. During the show when Keyhoe tried to depart from the censored script to \\"reveal something that has never been disclosed before,\\" CBS cut the sound, later stating Keyhoe was about to violate \\"predetermined security standards\\" and about to say something he wasn't \\"authorized to release.\\" Conspiracy theorists claim that what Keyhoe was about to reveal were four publicly unknown military studies concluding UFOs were interplanetary (including the 1948 Project Sign Estimate of the Situation and Blue Book's 1952 engineering analysis of UFO motion).

A March 1, 1967 memo directed to all USAF divisions, from USAF Lt. General Hewitt Wheless, Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, stated that unverified information indicated that unknown individuals, impersonating USAF officers and other military personnel, had been harassing civilian UFO witnesses, warning them not to talk, and also confiscating film, referring specifically to the Heflin incident. AFOSI was to be notified if any personnel were to become aware of any other incidents. (Document in Fawcett & Greenwood, 236.)Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood, The UFO Cover-Up (originally Clear Intent), New York: Fireside Books (Simon & Schuster), 1992, John Callahan, former Division Chief of the Accidents and Investigations Branch of the FAA, Washington D.C., also a Disclosure Project witness, said that following the Japan Air Lines flight 1628 incident that involved a giant UFO over Alaska, recorded by air and ground radar, the FAA conducted an investigation. Callahan held a briefing a few days later for President Reagan's Scientific Study Group, the FBI, and CIA. After the briefing, one of the CIA agents told everybody they \\"were never there and this never happened,\\" adding they were fearful of public panic.UFO Evidence.org documents According to one theory related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the CIA killed Kennedy in order to prevent him from leaking information to the Soviet Union about a covert program to reverse-engineer alien technology (i.e., Majestic 12). Nick Cook, an aviation investigative journalist for Jane's Information Group and researcher of Billion Dollar SecretReview of Billion Dollar Secret and The Hunt for Zero Point, \\"Into the Black\\" by Frank Bures, The Atlantic magazine. and author of The Hunt for Zero PointReview of \\"The Hunt for Zero Point\\" by Kurt Kleiner at Salon.com claims to have uncovered documentary evidence that top-secret US Defense Industry technology has been developed by government-backed Defense Industry programs, beginning in the 1940s using research conducted by Nazi scientists during WWII and recovered by Allied Military Intelligence, then taken to the U.S. and developed further with the collaboration of the same former German scientists at top-secret facilities established at White Sands, New Mexico, and later at Area 51, allegedly resulting in production of real-world prototype operational supersonic craft actually tested and used in clandestine military exercises, with other developments incorporated later into spy aircraft tasked with overflying hostile countries: the UFO story that evidence of alien technology is being suppressed and removed or destroyed was generated and then promoted by the CIA, beginning 1947, as false-lead disinformation to cover it all up for the sake of National Security, particularly during the Cold War, at a time when (his investigations found) the Soviet Union too was developing its own top-secret high-tech UFO craft. Cook's conclusions, alleging suppression of evidence of advanced human technology instead of alien, together with what he presents as declassified top-secret documents and blueprints, and his interviews of various experts (some of doubtful reliability), was developed and broadcast as a feature documentary on British television in 2005 as \\"UFOs: The Secret Evidence\\" and in the US in 2006 as a two-part episode on the History Channel's UFO Files, retitled \\"An Alien History of Planet Earth\\", with an added introduction by actor William Shatner. The History Channel program teaser promised \\"...a look at rumors of classified military aircraft incorporating alien technology into their designs.\\" In 1993, Steven M. Greer founded the Disclosure project to promote the concept of disclosing allegedly suppressed evidence of extraterrestrials. In May 2001, Greer held a press conference at the National Press Club in D.C that featured \\"20 retired Air Force, Federal Aviation Administration and intelligence officers\\" who demanded that Congress begin hearings on \\"secret U.S. involvement with UFOs and extraterrestrials\\" In 2013, Sen. Mike Gravel claimed that the government was suppressing evidence of extraterrestrials. Benjamin Radford has pointed out how unlikely such suppression of evidence is given that \\"[t]he UFO coverup conspiracy would have to span decades, cross international borders, and transcend political administrations\\" and that \\"all of the world's governments, in perpetuity, regardless of which political party is in power and even among enemies, [would] have colluded to continue the coverup.\\" In popular fiction In fiction and Sci reality, television programs (like The X-Files, Stargate, and Project Blue Book), films (such as Men in Black and Independence Day), and any number of novels have featured elements of UFO conspiracy theories. Fictionalized elements may include the government's sinister operatives from the men in black, the military bases known as Area 51, RAF Rudloe Manor or Porton Down, a rumored crash site in Roswell, New Mexico, the Rendlesham Forest Incident, a political committee dubbed \\"Majestic 12\\", or the successor of the UK Ministry of Defence's Flying Saucer Working Party (FSWP). The novel The Doomsday Conspiracy by Sidney Sheldon includes a UFO conspiracy in its plot.

The organization is claimed to be the code name of an alleged secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, formed in 1947 by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to facilitate recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft. The concept originated in a series of supposedly leaked secret government documents first circulated by ufologists in 1984. Upon examination, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declared the documents to be \\"completely bogus\\", and many ufologists consider them to be an elaborate hoax. Majestic 12 remains popular among some UFO conspiracy theorists and the concept has appeared in popular culture including television, film and literature. History The concept of \\"Majestic 12\\" emerged during a period in the 1980s when ufologists believed there had been a cover-up of the Roswell UFO incident and speculated some secretive upper tier of the United States government was responsible. Their suppositions appeared to be confirmed in 1984 when ufologist Jaime Shandera received an envelope containing film which, when developed, showed images of eight pages of documents that appeared to be briefing papers describing \\"Operation Majestic 12\\". The documents purported to reveal a secret committee of 12, supposedly authorized by United States President Harry S. Truman in 1952, and explain how the crash of an alien spacecraft at Roswell in July of 1947 had been concealed, how the recovered alien technology could be exploited, and how the United States should engage with extraterrestrial life in the future. Shandera and his ufologist colleagues Stanton T. Friedman and Bill Moore say they later received a series of anonymous messages that led them to find what has been called the \\"Cutler/Twining memo\\" in 1985 while searching declassified files in the National Archives. Purporting to be written by President Eisenhower's assistant Robert Cutler to General Nathan F. Twining and containing a reference to Majestic 12, the memo is widely held to be a forgery, likely planted as part of a hoax. Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the ufologists came to believe the story despite the documents being \\"obviously planted to bolster the legitimacy of the briefing papers\\". Claiming to be connected to the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations, a man named Richard Doty told filmmaker Linda Moulton Howe that the MJ-12 story was true, and showed Howe unspecified documents purporting to prove the existence of small, grey humanoid aliens originating from the Zeta Reticuli star system. Doty reportedly promised to supply Howe with film footage of UFOs and an interview with an alien being, although no footage ever materialized. Soon, distrust and suspicion led to disagreements within the ufology community over the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents, and Moore was accused of taking part in an elaborate hoax, while other ufologists and debunkers such as Philip J. Klass were accused of being \\"disinformation agents\\".  Analysis  Klass's investigation of the MJ-12 documents found that Robert Cutler was actually out of the country on the date he supposedly wrote the \\"Cutler/Twining memo\\", and that the Truman signature was \\"a pasted-on photocopy of a genuine signature ‚Äîincluding accidental scratch marks ‚Äî from a memo that Truman wrote to Vannevar Bush on October 1, 1947\\". Klass dismissed theories that the documents were part of a disinformation campaign as \\"ridiculous\\", saying they contained numerous flaws that could never fool Soviet or Chinese intelligence. Other discrepancies noted by Klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in Moore's personal letters, and a conversation reported by Brad Sparks in which Moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax Top Secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government's (alleged) UFO coverup to break their oaths of secrecy. The FBI began its own investigation of the supposed \\"secret\\" documents and quickly formed doubts as to their authenticity. The United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations stated that no such committee had ever been authorized or formed, and that the documents were \\"bogus\\". The FBI subsequently declared the MJ-12 documents to be \\"completely bogus\\". Later in 1996, a document called the MJ-12 \\"Special Operations Manual\\" circulated among ufologists. It is also widely considered to be a fake and \\"a continuation of the MJ-12 myth\\". Ufologists Linda Moulton Howe and Stanton T. Friedman believe the MJ-12 documents are authentic. Friedman examined the documents and has argued that the United States government has conspired to cover up knowledge of a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft. According to journalist Howard Blum the name \\"Majestic 12\\" had been prefigured in the UFO community when Bill Moore asked National Enquirer reporter Bob Pratt in 1982 to collaborate on a novel called MAJIK-12. Because of this, Blum writes, Pratt had always been inclined to think the Majestic 12 documents a hoax. Scientific skeptic author Brian Dunning investigated the history of the subject, and reported his findings in the 2016 Skeptoid podcast episode \\"The Secret History of Majestic 12\\". He cited ufologist Bill Moore‚Äôs suspicion that, rather than a hoax perpetrated by the UFO community, the papers were actually part of a disinformation campaign of the US government meant to deflect attention from secret Air Force projects.

His recordings with the funk and soul band Commodores and during his solo career made him one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s. Beginning in 1968, Richie was a member of the Commodores. The Commodores became established as a popular soul group; their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as \\"Machine Gun\\" and \\"Brick House\\". Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as \\"Easy\\", \\"Three Times a Lady\\", \\"Still\\", and the breakup ballad \\"Sail On\\". Richie launched a solo career in 1982 and his 1982 debut solo album, Lionel Richie, contained three hit singles: the U.S. number-one song \\"Truly\\", and the top five hits \\"You Are\\" and \\"My Love\\". The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over four million copies. His 1983 follow-up album, Can't Slow Down, sold over twice as many copies, propelling him into the first rank of international superstars. He also co-wrote the 1985 charity single \\"We Are the World\\" with Michael Jackson, which sold over 20 million copies. Over the course of his career, Richie has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time. He won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Can't Slow Down, and his other Grammy Awards include Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) in 1985 and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \\"Truly\\" in 1983. Richie has also been nominated for two Golden Globe awards and won one. In 1982 he was nominated for Best Original Song for the film Endless Love. In 1986 he won the Golden Globe award for Best Original Song for \\"Say You, Say Me\\", featured in the film White Nights. The song also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 2016, Richie received the Songwriters Hall of Fame's highest honor, the Johnny Mercer Award. He has served with Luke Bryan and Katy Perry as a judge for the singing competition American Idol since its move to ABC from the Fox network. Early life Richie was born and raised in Tuskegee, Alabama, the son of Lionel Brockman Richie Sr. and Alberta R. Foster.Richie, Lionel. Who Do You Think You Are?, March 4, 2011. He grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute. He graduated from Joliet Township High School, East Campus, in Joliet, Illinois. A star tennis player in Joliet, he accepted a tennis scholarship to attend Tuskegee Institute, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics. Richie considered studying divinity to become a priest in the Episcopal Church, but he ultimately decided he was not \\"priest material\\" and decided to continue his musical career. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi, a national honor fraternity for band members, and an active life member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Career=Commodores= As a student in Tuskegee, Richie formed a succession of R&B; groups in the mid-1960s. In 1968, he became a singer and saxophonist with the Commodores. They signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 1968 for one record before moving on to Motown Records initially as a support act to The Jackson 5. The Commodores then became established as a popular soul group. Their first several albums had a danceable, funky sound, as in such tracks as \\"Machine Gun\\" and \\"Brick House.\\" Over time, Richie wrote and sang more romantic, easy-listening ballads such as \\"Easy\\", \\"Three Times a Lady\\", \\"Still\\", and the breakup ballad \\"Sail On\\". In 1974, Richie achieved his first commercial success as a songwriter with \\"Happy People,\\" which he co-wrote with Jeffrey Bowen and Donald Baldwin. Originally intended as a Commodores track, it was recorded by The Temptations, who had their penultimate #1 R&B; with the song. By the late 1970s, Richie had begun to accept songwriting commissions from other artists. He composed \\"Lady\\" for Kenny Rogers, which hit No. 1 in 1980, and produced Rogers' album Share Your Love the following year. Richie and Rogers maintained a strong friendship in later years. Latin jazz composer and salsa romantica pioneer La Palabra enjoyed international success with his cover of \\"Lady,\\" which was played at Latin dance clubs. Also in 1981 Richie sang the theme song for the film Endless Love, a duet with Diana Ross. Issued as a single, the song topped the Canada, Brazil, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and US pop music charts, and became one of Motown's biggest hits. Its success encouraged Richie to branch out into a full-fledged solo career in 1982. He was replaced as lead singer for the Commodores by Skyler Jett in 1983. =Solo career= Richie's 1982 debut solo album, Lionel Richie, contained three hit singles: the U.S. number- one song \\"Truly\\", which continued the style of his ballads with the Commodores and launched his career as one of the most successful balladeers of the 1980s, and the top five hits \\"You Are\\" and \\"My Love\\". The album hit No. 3 on the music charts and sold over 4 million copies. His 1983 follow-up album, Can't Slow Down, sold over twice as many copies and won two Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, propelling him into the first rank of international superstars. The album contained the number-one hit \\"All Night Long\\" a Caribbean-flavored dance number that was promoted by a colorful music video produced by former Monkee Michael Nesmith. In 1984, he performed \\"All Night Long\\" at the closing ceremony of the XXIII Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Several more Top 10 hits followed, the most successful of which was the ballad \\"Hello\\" (1984), a sentimental love song that showed how far he had moved from his R&B; roots. Richie had three more top ten hits in 1984, \\"Stuck on You\\" (#3), \\"Running with the Night\\" (#7) and \\"Penny Lover\\" (#8), as well as writing & producing \\"Missing You\\" for former labelmate and duet partner Diana Ross (#10 Pop, #1 R&B;). In 1985, he wrote and performed \\"Say You, Say Me\\" for the film White Nights. The song won an Academy Award and reached No. 1 on the U.S. charts, staying there for four weeks, making it the number-two song of 1986 according to Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 chart, behind the charity single \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" by Dionne and Friends. He also collaborated with Michael Jackson on the charity single \\"We Are the World\\" by USA for Africa, another number-one hit. In 1986, Richie released Dancing on the Ceiling, his last widely popular album, which produced a run of five US and UK hits, \\"Say You, Say Me\\" (U.S. #1), \\"Dancing on the Ceiling\\" (U.S. #2), \\"Love Will Conquer All\\" (U.S. #9), \\"Ballerina Girl\\" (U.S. #7), and \\"Se La\\" (U.S. #20). He made his return to recording and performing following the release of his first greatest-hits collection, Back to Front, in 1992. Since then, his ever-more- relaxed schedule has kept his recording and live work to a minimum. He broke the silence in 1996 with Louder Than Words, on which he resisted any change of style or the musical fashion-hopping of the past decade, sticking instead with his chosen path of well-crafted soul music, which in the intervening years has become known as contemporary R&B.; Richie's albums in the 1990s such as Louder Than Words and Time failed to match the commercial success of his earlier work. Some of his recent albums, such as Renaissance, have returned to his older style and achieved success in Europe but only modest notice in the United States. =Later career= Richie was the headliner at a 2006 Fourth of July tribute concert with Fantasia Barrino at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. On May 7, 2006, Richie performed on the main stage (Acura Stage) at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, replacing Antoine \\"Fats\\" Domino, who had fallen ill. Richie released his eighth studio album titled \\"Coming Home\\" on September 12, 2006. The first single of the album was \\"I Call It Love\\" and was premiered in July 2006, becoming his biggest hit in the U.S. in ten years. The album was a big success for Richie in the United States, peaking at No. 6. On December 9, 2006, Richie hosted and performed live on the British television show An Audience with Lionel Richie. Two months later, he performed \\"Hello\\" on the 49th Grammy Awards show. On May 2, 2008, Richie was the 21st recipient of the George and Ira Gershwin Lifetime Achievement Award at UCLA's annual Spring Sing. In accepting the award, Richie said: \\"Forget about surviving 30 some odd years in the music business, Lionel Richie survived 27 years of Nicole Richie.\\" On December 31, 2008, Richie performed in Times Square for the New Year's Eve celebration and ball drop. He also performed on the 2009 season finale for American Idol with Danny Gokey. In May 2009, he announced that he would like to get The Commodores back together soon, \\"or in the next 10 years no one will care.\\" An album, Just Go, was released in 2009. On July 7, 2009, Richie performed \\"Jesus is Love\\" at Michael Jackson's memorial service. Richie and Guy Sebastian performing \\"All Night Long\\" during Richie's 2011 Australian and New Zealand tour On October 2, 2010, Richie performed at the AFL Grand Final Replay in Australia, both at the pre-game entertainment to a sell-out crowd and also post-match at AAMI Park.

Critiques of productivism center primarily on the limits to growth posed by a finite planet and extend into discussions of human procreation, the work ethic, and even alternative energy production. Arguments for productivism Although productivism is often meant pejoratively as a general problem in politics and economics, most countries and economies are productivist in nature. While critics of productivism and its political-economic variants, notably capitalism and socialism, challenge the notions of conventional political economy and argue for an economic policy more compatible with humanity, these views are often dismissed as utopian by economists and political scientists, who hold that there is no conflict between the roles of the worker and the citizen, the father and the mother, and so on. That is, that conventional economics, particularly macroeconomics, already accounts for the relationship between productivity and the freedom to enjoy that productivity. Criticism of productivism Anthony Giddens defines productivism as: :an ethos in which ‚Äúwork‚Äù, as paid employment, has been separated out in a clear-cut way from other domains of life. He further states: :[work] defines whether or not individuals feel worthwhile or socially valued. Although \\"productivism\\" can be considered pejorative, as it is unacceptable to many individuals and ideologies that it describes, these same individuals and ideologies often use phrases like \\"productivity\\", \\"growth\\", \\"economic sense\\", and \\"common sense\\" without argument, presupposing the primacy of industry. According to those who use the term \\"productivism\\", the difference between themselves and the promoters of conventional neoclassical economics is that a productivist does not believe in the idea of \\"uneconomic growth\\". That is, the productivist believes all growth is good, while the critic of productivism believes it can be more like a disease, measurably growing but interfering with life processes, and that it is up to the electorate, worker, and purchaser to put values on their free time and decide whether to use their time for production or their money for consumption. A key academic critic of productivism is Amartya Sen, winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economics. His theory of \\"development as freedom\\" is one of several human development theories that state that the growth of individual capital‚Äîthat is, \\"talent\\", \\"creativity\\", and \\"personal ingenuity\\"‚Äîis more significant than the growth of many other measurable quantities, such as the production of products for commodity markets. As long ago as 1975, in his essays, the British economist E. F. Schumacher remarked: :Infinite growth in consumption in a world of finite resources is an impossibility. and: :When my child grows, I am pleased. When I grow, less so!

Christmas cards are usually exchanged during the weeks preceding Christmas Day by many people (including some non- Christians) in Western society and in Asia. The traditional greeting reads \\"wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\\". There are innumerable variations on this greeting, many cards expressing more religious sentiment, or containing a poem, prayer, Christmas song lyrics or Biblical verse; others focus on the general holiday season with an all-inclusive \\"Season's greetings\\". The first modern Christmas card was by John Calcott Horsley. A Christmas card is generally commercially designed and purchased for the occasion. The content of the design might relate directly to the Christmas narrative with depictions of the Nativity of Jesus, or have Christian symbols such as the Star of Bethlehem or a white dove representing both the Holy Spirit and Peace. Many Christmas cards show Christmas traditions, such as seasonal figures (e.g., Santa Claus, snowmen, and reindeer), objects associated with Christmas such as candles, holly, baubles, and Christmas trees, and Christmastime activities such as shopping, caroling, and partying, or other aspects of the season such as the snow and wildlife of the northern winter. Some secular cards depict nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in 19th century streetscapes; others are humorous, particularly in depicting the antics of Santa and his elves. History The world's first commercially produced Christmas card, designed by John Callcott Horsley for Henry Cole in 1843 New York 1910 anthropomorphized frogs parading with banner and band. The first recorded Christmas cards were sent by Michael Maier to James I of England and his son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales in 1611. It was discovered in 1979 by Adam McLean in the Scottish Record Office. They incorporated Rosicrucian imagery, with the words of the greeting ‚Äì \\"A greeting on the birthday of the Sacred King, to the most worshipful and energetic lord and most eminent James, King of Great Britain and Ireland, and Defender of the true faith, with a gesture of joyful celebration of the Birthday of the Lord, in most joyand fortune, we enter into the new auspicious year 1612\\" ‚Äì being laid out to form a rose. The next cards were commissioned by Sir Henry Cole and illustrated by John Callcott Horsley in London on 1 May 1843.Christmas card sold for record price BBC News. Retrieved June 12, 2011.Gy√∂rgy Buday, George Buday (1992). The history of the Christmas card. p.8. Omnigraphics, 1992 The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor.The Times (London, England), 26 November 2001, p.8 12 cards from the original print run are said to survive: one, sent by Henry Cole and his wife to his grandmother, was sold in 2001 for ¬£20,000. Allegedly the image of the family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two batches totaling 2,050 cards were printed and sold that year for a shilling each. Early British cards rarely showed winter or religious themes, instead favoring flowers, fairies and other fanciful designs that reminded the recipient of the approach of spring. Humorous and sentimental images of children and animals were popular, as were increasingly elaborate shapes, decorations and materials. At Christmas 1873, the lithograph firm Prang and Mayer began creating greeting cards for the popular market in Britain The firm began selling the Christmas card in America in 1874, thus becoming the first printer to offer cards in America. Its owner, Louis Prang, is sometimes called the \\"father of the American Christmas card.\\"Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. ¬©1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. p 148 . By the 1880s, Prang was producing over five million cards a year by using the chromolithography process of printmaking. However, the popularity of his cards led to cheap imitations that eventually drove him from the market. The advent of the postcard spelled the end for elaborate Victorian- style cards, but by the 1920s, cards with envelopes had returned. The extensive Laura Seddon Greeting Card Collection from the Manchester Metropolitan University gathers 32,000 Victorian and Edwardian greeting cards, printed by the major publishers of the day, including Britain's first commercially produced Christmas card. The production of Christmas cards was, throughout the 20th century, a profitable business for many stationery manufacturers, with the design of cards continually evolving with changing tastes and printing techniques. The now widely recognized brand Hallmark Cards was established in 1913 by Joyce Hall with the help of brother Rollie Hall to market their self-produced Christmas cards. The Hall brothers capitalized on a growing desire for more personalized greeting cards, and reached critical success when the outbreak of World War I increased demand for cards to send to soldiers. The World Wars brought cards with patriotic themes. Idiosyncratic \\"studio cards\\" with cartoon illustrations and sometimes risque humor caught on in the 1950s. Nostalgic, sentimental, and religious images have continued in popularity, and, in the 21st century, reproductions of Victorian and Edwardian cards are easy to obtain. Modern Christmas cards can be bought individually but are also sold in packs of the same or varied designs. In recent decades changes in technology may be responsible for the decline of the Christmas card. The estimated number of cards received by American households dropped from 29 in 1987 to 20 in 2004. Email and telephones allow for more frequent contact and are easier for generations raised without handwritten letters - especially given the availability of websites offering free email Christmas cards. Despite the decline, 1.9 billion cards were sent in the U.S. in 2005 alone. Some card manufacturers now provide E-cards. In the UK, Christmas cards account for almost half of the volume of greeting card sales, with over 668.9 million Christmas cards sold in the 2008 festive period.Facts And Figures - GCA: The Greeting Card Association Retrieved 17 June 2011. In mostly non- religious countries (e.g. Czech Republic), the cards are rather called New Year Cards, however they are sent before Christmas and the emphasis (design, texts) is mostly given to the New Year, omitting religious symbols. =Official Christmas cards= President Johnson's 1967 White House Christmas card \\"Official\\" Christmas cards began with Queen Victoria in the 1840s. The British royal family's cards are generally portraits reflecting significant personal events of the year. There is a long-standing custom for the President and First Lady to send White House Christmas Cards each holiday season. The practice originated with President Calvin Coolidge, who was the first president to issue a written statement of peaceful tidings during the holidays in 1927. President Herbert Hoover was the first to give Christmas notes to the White House staff, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was the first president to utilize the card format (rather than the previously used notes or a written statement) that most closely resembles the Christmas cards of today. In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower issued the first official White House card. The cards usually depict White House scenes as rendered by prominent American artists. The number of recipients has snowballed over the decades, from just 2,000 in 1961 to 1.4 million in 2005. =Commercial Christmas cards= Tucker Corporation Christmas Card, 1947 Many businesses, from small local businesses to multi-national enterprises, send Christmas cards to the people on their customer lists, as a way to develop general goodwill, retain brand awareness and reinforce social networks. These cards are almost always discrete and secular in design, and do not attempt to sell a product, limiting themselves to mentioning the name of the business. The practice harkens back to trade cards of the 18th century, an ancestor of the modern Christmas card. =Charity Christmas cards= Royal typewriters Many organizations produce special Christmas cards as a fundraising tool. The most famous of these enterprises is probably the UNICEF Christmas card program,UNICEF Christmas Card Program, UNICEF Philippines launched in 1949, which selects artwork from internationally known artists for card reproduction.

Small decorative stickers are also made to seal the back of envelopes, typically showing a trinket or some symbol of Christmas. In 2004, the German post office gave away 20 million free scented stickers, to make Christmas cards smell of a fir Christmas tree, cinnamon, gingerbread, a honey-wax candle, a baked apple and an orange. =Collectors items= From the beginning, Christmas cards have been avidly collected. Queen Mary amassed a large collection that is now housed in the British Museum. The University College London's Slade School of Fine Art houses a collection of handmade Christmas Cards from alumni such as Paula Rego and Richard Hamilton and are displayed at events over the Christmas season, when members of the public can make their own Christmas cards in the Strang Print Room. Specimens from the \\"golden age\\" of printing (1840s‚Äì1890s) are especially prized and bring in large sums at auctions. In December 2005, one of Horsley's original cards sold for nearly ¬£9,000. Collectors may focus on particular images like Santa Claus, poets, or printing techniques. The Christmas card that holds the world record as the most expensive ever sold was a card produced in 1843 by J. C. Horsley and commissioned by civil servant Sir Henry Cole. The card, one of the world's first, was sold in 2001 by UK auctioneers Henry Aldridge to an anonymous bidder for a record breaking ¬£22,250.

Since the 19th century, many families and individuals have chosen to make their own Christmas cards, either in response to monetary necessity, as an artistic endeavour, or in order to avoid the commercialism associated with Christmas cards. With a higher preference of handmade gifts during the 19th century over purchased or commercial items, homemade cards carried high sentimental value as gifts alone. Many families make the creation of Christmas cards a family endeavour and part of the seasonal festivity, along with stirring the Christmas cake and decorating the tree. Over the years such cards have been produced in every type of paint and crayon, in collage and in simple printing techniques such as potato-cuts. A revival of interest in paper crafts, particularly scrapbooking, has raised the status of the homemade card and made available an array of tools for stamping, punching and cutting. Advances in digital photography and printing have provided the technology for many people to design and print their own cards, using their original graphic designs or photos, or those available with many computer programs or online as clip art, as well as a great range of typefaces. Such homemade cards include personal touches such as family photos and holidays snapshots. Crowdsourcing, another trend enabled by the Internet, has allowed thousands of independent and hobbyist graphic designers to produce and distribute holiday cards around the world. The Christmas card list Christmas Market in N√ºrnberg, lithography from the 19th century. Danish Christmas card, 1919 Many people send cards to both close friends and distant acquaintances, potentially making the sending of cards a multi-hour chore in addressing dozens or even hundreds of envelopes. The greeting in the card can be personalized but brief, or may include a summary of the year's news. The extreme of this is the Christmas letter (below). Because cards are usually exchanged year after year, the phrase \\"to be off someone's Christmas card list\\" is used to indicate a falling out between friends or public figures. =Christmas letters= Some people take the annual mass-mailing of cards as an opportunity to update those they know with the year's events, and include the so-called \\"Christmas letter\\" reporting on the family's doings, sometimes running to multiple printed pages. In the UK these are known as round-robin letters. While a practical notion, Christmas letters meet with a mixed reception; recipients may take it as boring minutiae, bragging, or a combination of the two, whereas other people appreciate Christmas letters as more personal than mass-produced cards with a generic missive and an opportunity to \\"catch up\\" with the lives of family and friends who are rarely seen or communicated with. Since the letter will be received by both close and distant relatives, there is also the potential for the family members to object to how they are presented to others; an entire episode of Everybody Loves Raymond was built around conflict over the content of just such a letter. Environmental impact and recycling Christmas card with holly Jacques Hnizdovsky Christmas card During the first 70 years of the 19th century it was common for Christmas and other greeting cards to be recycled by women's service organizations who collected them and removed the pictures, to be pasted into scrap books for the entertainment of children in hospitals, orphanages, kindergartens and missions. With children's picture books becoming cheaper and more readily available, this form of scrap-booking has almost disappeared. Recent concern over the environmental impact of printing, mailing and delivering cards has fueled an increase in e-cards. The U.K. conservation charity Woodland Trust runs an annual campaign to collect and recycle Christmas cards to raise awareness of recycling and collect donations from corporate sponsors and supporters. All recycled cards help raise money to plant more trees. In the 12 years that the Woodland Trust Christmas Card Recycling Scheme has been running, more than 600 million cards have been recycled. This has enabled the Woodland Trust to plant more than 141,000 trees, save over 12,000 tonnes of paper from landfill and stop over 16,000 tonnes of CO2 from going into the atmosphere ‚Äì the equivalent to taking more than 5,000 cars off the road for a year. The scheme has had celebrity supporters including Jo Brand, Dermot O' Leary and Sean Bean and is the longest running scheme of its type in the country.

History = Early history = During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, notebooks were often made by hand at home by drawing on them into gatherings that were then bound at a later date. The pages were blank and every notekeeper had to make ruled lines across the paper. Making and keeping notebooks was such an important information management technique that children learned how to do in school. = Legal pad = Legal pad and pencil According to a legend, Thomas W. Holley of Holyoke, Massachusetts, invented the legal pad around the year 1888 when he innovated the idea to collect all the sortings, various sorts of sub-standard paper scraps from various factories, and stitch them together in order to sell them as pads at an affordable and fair price. In about 1900, the latter then evolved into the modern, traditionally yellow legal pad when a local judge requested for a margin to be drawn on the left side of the paper. This was the first legal pad. The only technical requirement for this type of stationery to be considered a true \\"legal pad\\" is that it must have margins of 1.25 inches (3.17 centimeters) from the left edge. Here, the margin, also known as down lines,David Pescovitz, 19 September 2006. Inventing the yellow legal pad \\"The legal pad's margins, also called down lines, are drawn 1.25 inches from the left edge of the page. (This is the only requirement for a pad to qualify as a legal pad, though the iconic version has yellow paper, blue lines, and a red gummed top.) Holley added the ruling that defined the legal pad in the early 1900s at the request of a local judge who was looking for space to comment on his own notes\\", Retrieved 9 November 2010. is room used to write notes or comments. Legal pads usually have a gum binding at the top instead of a spiral or stitched binding. In 1902, J.A. Birchall of Birchalls, a Launceston, Tasmania, Australia-based stationery shop, decided that the cumbersome method of selling writing paper in folded stacks of \\"quires\\" (four sheets of paper or parchment folded to form eight leaves) was inefficient. As a solution, he glued together a stack of halved sheets of paper, supported by a sheet of cardboard, creating what he called the \\"Silver City Writing Tablet\\".  Binding and cover  Notebook with different color covers Principal types of binding are padding, perfect, spiral, comb, sewn, clasp, disc, and pressure, some of which can be combined. Binding methods can affect whether a notebook can lie flat when open and whether the pages are likely to remain attached. The cover material is usually distinct from the writing surface material, more durable, more decorative, and more firmly attached. It also is stiffer than the pages, even taken together. Cover materials should not contribute to damage or discomfort. A journal writing book. It is frequently cheaper to purchase notebooks that are spiral-bound, meaning that a spiral of wire is looped through large perforations at the top or side of the page. Other bound notebooks are available that use glue to hold the pages together; this process is \\"padding.\\"Adhesive Binding Today, it is common for pages in such notebooks to include a thin line of perforations that make it easier to tear out the page. Spiral-bound pages can be torn out, but frequently leave thin scraggly strips from the small amount of paper that is within the spiral, as well as an uneven rip along the top of the torn-out page. Hard-bound notebooks include a sewn spine, and the pages are not easily removed. Some styles of sewn bindings allow pages to open flat, while others cause the pages to drape. Variations of notebooks that allow pages to be added, removed, and replaced are bound by rings, rods, or discs. In each of these systems, the pages are modified with perforations that facilitate the specific binding mechanism's ability to secure them. Ring-bound and rod-bound notebooks secure their contents by threading perforated pages around straight or curved prongs. In the open position, the pages can be removed and rearranged. In the closed position, the pages are kept in order. Disc-bound notebooks remove the open or closed operation by modifying the pages themselves. A page perforated for a disc- bound binding system contains a row of teeth along the side edge of the page that grip onto the outside raised perimeter of individual discs.  Preprinting  Notebooks used for drawing and scrapbooking are usually blank. Notebooks for writing usually have some kind of printing on the writing material, if only lines to align writing or facilitate certain kinds of drawing. Inventor's notebooks have page numbers preprinted to support priority claims. They may be considered as grey literature.[https://guides.mclibrary.duke.edu/sysreview/greylit Many notebooks have graphic decorations. Personal organizers can have various kinds of preprinted pages.  Uses  Notes in a notebook Artists often use large notebooks, which include wide spaces of blank paper appropriate for drawing. Similarly composers utilize notebooks for writing their \\"lyrics\\". Lawyers use rather large notebooks known as legal pads that contain lined paper (often yellow) and are appropriate for use on tables and desks. These horizontal lines or \\"rules\\" are sometimes classified according to their space apart with \\"wide rule\\" the farthest, \\"college rule\\" closer, \\"legal rule\\" slightly closer and \\"narrow rule\\" closest, allowing more lines of text per page. When sewn into a pasteboard backing, these may be called composition books, or in smaller signatures may be called \\"blue books\\" or exam books and used for essay exams. In contrast, journalists prefer small, hand-held notebooks for portability (reporters' notebooks), and sometimes use shorthand when taking notes. Scientists and other researchers use lab notebooks to document their experiments. The pages in lab notebooks are sometimes graph paper to plot data. Police officers are required to write notes on what they observe, using a police notebook. Land surveyors commonly record field notes in durable, hard-bound notebooks called \\"field books.\\" Coloring enthusiasts use coloring notebooks for stress relief. The pages in coloring notebooks contain different adult coloring pages. Students take notes in notebooks, and studies suggest that the act of writing (as opposed to typing) improves learning. Notebook pages can be recycled via standard paper recycling. Recycled notebooks are available, differing in recycled percentage and paper quality.  Electronic successors  Since the late 20th century, many attempts have been made to integrate the simplicity of a notebook with the editing, searching, and communication capacities of computers through the development of note taking software. Laptop computers began to be called notebooks when they reached a small size in the mid 1990s, but they did not have any special note-taking ability. Most notably Personal digital assistants (PDAs) came next, integrating small liquid crystal displays with a touch-sensitive layer to input graphics and written text. Later on this role was taken over by smartphones and tablets. Digital paper combines the simplicity of a traditional pen and notebook with digital storage and interactivity. By printing an invisible dot pattern on the notebook paper and using a pen with a built in infrared camera the written text can be transferred to a laptop, mobile phone or backoffice for storage and processing.

Several changes occurred throughout its lifetime, initially from a 'blocking-force' to a more modern conventional force using helicopter deployment in combat. During the American intervention, the role of the ARVN was marginalised to a defensive role with an incomplete modernisation, and transformed again following Vietnamization, it was upgeared, expanded, and reconstructed to fulfill the role of the departing American forces. By 1974, it had become much more effective with foremost counterinsurgency expert and Nixon adviser Robert Thompson noting that Regular Forces were very well-trained and second only to the American and Israeli forces in the Free World and with General Creighton Abrams remarking that 70% of units were on par with the US Army. However, the withdrawal of American forces by Vietnamization meant the armed forces could not effectively fulfill all of the aims of the program and had become completely dependent on U.S. equipment since it was meant to fulfill the departing role of the United States. At its peak, an estimated 1 in 9 citizens of South Vietnam were enlisted and had become the fourth-largest army in the world composed of Regular Forces and the more voluntary Regional and Village-level militias. Unique in serving a dual military-civilian administrative purpose, in direct competition with the Viet Cong, the ARVN had also become a component of political power and suffered from continual issues of political loyalty appointments, corruption in leadership, factional infighting, and occasional open internal conflict. After the fall of Saigon to North Vietnam's People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), the ARVN was dissolved. While some high-ranking officers had fled the country to the United States or elsewhere, thousands of former ARVN officers were sent to re-education camps by the communist government of the unified Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Five ARVN generals committed suicide to avoid capture by the PAVN/VC. History=Vietnamese National Army (VNA) 1949‚Äì55= TDND 5 airborne unit fought several battles including Dien Bien Phu. On 8 March 1949, after the √âlys√©e Accords, the State of Vietnam was recognized by France as an independent country ruled by the Vietnamese Emperor B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i, and the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) was soon created. The VNA fought in joint operations with the French Union's French Far East Expeditionary Corps against the Viet Minh forces led by Ho Chi Minh. The VNA fought in a wide range of campaigns including the Battle of N√† S·∫£n (1952), Operation Atlas (1953) and the Battle of Dien Bien Phu (1954).Vietnamese National Army gallery (May 1951 ‚Äì June 1954) French Defense Ministry archives ECPAD Benefiting from French assistance, the VNA quickly became a modern army modeled after the Expeditionary Corps. It included infantry, artillery, signals, armored cavalry, airborne, airforce, navy and a national military academy. By 1953 troopers as well as officers were all Vietnamese, the latter having been trained in Ecoles des Cadres such as Da Lat, including Chief of Staff General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Hinh who was a French Union airforce veteran. After the 1954 Geneva agreements, French Indochina ceased to exist and by 1956 all French Union troops had withdrawn from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. In 1955, by the order of Prime Minister Di·ªám, the VNA crushed the armed forces of the B√¨nh Xuy√™n.** =Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 1955‚Äì75= Early unmodified ARVN M113 during the Vietnam War On 26 October 1955, the military was reorganized by the administration of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám who then formally established the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) on 30 December 1955. The air force was established as a separate service known as the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF). Early on, the focus of the army was the guerrilla fighters of the Viet Cong (VC), formed to oppose the Di·ªám administration. The United States, under President John F. Kennedy sent advisors and a great deal of financial support to aid the ARVN in combating the insurgents. A major campaign, developed by Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu and later resurrected under another name was the \\"Strategic Hamlet Program\\" which was regarded as unsuccessful by Western media because it was \\"inhumane\\" to move villagers from the countryside to fortified villages. ARVN leaders and President Di·ªám were criticized by the foreign press when the troops were used to crush armed anti-government religious groups like the Cao ƒê√†i and H√≤a H·∫£o as well as to raid Buddhist temples, which according to Di·ªám, were harboring VC guerrillas. The most notorious of these attacks occurred on the night of August 21, 1963, during the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids conducted by the Special Forces, which caused a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds. In 1963 Di·ªám was killed in a coup d'√©tat carried out by ARVN officers and encouraged by American officials such as Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. In the confusion that followed, General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh took control, but he was only the first in a succession of ARVN generals to assume the presidency of South Vietnam. During these years, the United States began taking more control of the war against the VC and the role of the ARVN became less and less significant. They were also plagued by continuing problems of severe corruption amongst the officer corps. Although the US was highly critical of the ARVN, it continued to be entirely US-armed and funded. Although the American news media has often portrayed the Vietnam War as a primarily American and North Vietnamese conflict, the ARVN carried the brunt of the fight before and after large-scale American involvement, and participated in many major operations with American troops. ARVN troops pioneered the use of the M113 armored personnel carrier as an infantry fighting vehicle by fighting mounted rather than as a \\"battle taxi\\" as originally designed, and the armored cavalry (ACAV) modifications were adopted based on ARVN experience. One notable ARVN unit equipped with M113s, the 3d Armored Cavalry Squadron, used the new tactic so proficiently and with such extraordinary heroism against hostile forces that they earned the United States Presidential Unit Citation. The ARVN suffered 254,256 recorded deaths between 1960 and 1974, with the highest number of recorded deaths being in 1972, with 39,587 combat deaths,Clarke, Jeffrey J. (1988), United States Army in Vietnam: Advice and Support: The Final Years, 1965‚Äì1973, Washington, D.C: Center of Military History, United States Army, p. 275 while approximately 58,000 U.S. troops died during the war. There were also many circumstances in which Vietnamese families had members on both sides of the conflict.

Major shortcomings identified by U.S. officers included a general lack of motivation, indicated, for example, by officers having an inclination for rear area jobs rather than combat command, and a continuing desertion problem. =Final campaigns= Starting in 1969 President Richard Nixon started the process of \\"Vietnamization\\", pulling out American forces and rendering the ARVN capable of fighting an effective war against the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and VC. Slowly, the ARVN began to expand from its counter-insurgency role to become the primary ground defense against the PAVN/VC. From 1969 to 1971 there were about 22,000 ARVN combat deaths per year. Starting in 1968, South Vietnam began calling up every available man for service in the ARVN, reaching a strength of one million soldiers by 1972. In 1970 they performed well in the Cambodian Incursion and were executing three times as many operations as they had during the American-led war period. However, the ARVN equipment continued to be of lower standards than their American and other allies, even as the U.S. tried to upgrade ARVN technology. The officer corps was still the biggest problem. Leaders were too often inept, being poorly trained, corrupt and lacking morale. Still, Sir Robert Thompson, a British military officer widely regarded as the worlds foremost expert in counterinsurgency warfare during the Vietnam War, thought that by 1972, the ARVN had developed into one of the best fighting forces in the world, comparing them favorably with the Israeli Defence Forces.Make For the Hills: The Autobiography of the World's Leading Counter Insurgency Expert. Leo Cooper (1989): page 114. Forced to carry the burden left by the Americans, the ARVN actually started to perform rather well, though with continued American air support. In 1972, the PAVN launched the Easter Offensive, an all-out attack against South Vietnam across the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone and from its sanctuaries in Laos and Cambodia. The assault combined infantry wave assaults, artillery and the first massive use of armored forces by the PAVN. Although the T-54 tanks proved vulnerable to LAW rockets, the ARVN took heavy losses. The PAVN forces took Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province and some areas along the Laos and Cambodian borders. M41 Walker Bulldog was used by the ARVN President Nixon dispatched bombers in Operation Linebacker to provide air support for the ARVN when it seemed that South Vietnam was about to be lost. In desperation, President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu fired the incompetent General Ho√†ng Xu√¢n L√£m and replaced him with General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng. He gave the order that all deserters would be executed and pulled enough forces together in order to prevent the PAVN from taking Hu·∫ø. Finally, with considerable US air and naval support, as well as hard fighting by the ARVN soldiers, the Easter Offensive was halted. ARVN forces counter-attacked and succeeded in driving some of the PAVN out of South Vietnam, though they did retain control of northern Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province near the DMZ. At the end of 1972, Operation Linebacker II helped achieve a negotiated end to the war between the U.S. and the Hanoi government. By March 1973, in accordance with the Paris Peace Accords the United States had completely pulled its troops out of Vietnam. The ARVN was left to fight alone, but with all the weapons and technologies that their allies left behind. With massive technological support they had roughly four times as many heavy weapons as their enemies. The U.S. left the ARVN with over one thousand aircraft, making the RVNAF the fourth largest air force in the world. These figures are deceptive, however, as the U.S. began to curtail military aid. The same situation happened to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, since their allies, the Soviet Union, and China has also cut down military support, forcing them to use obsolete T-34 tanks and SU-100 tank destroyers in battle. In the summer of 1974, Nixon resigned under the pressure of the Watergate scandal and was succeeded by Gerald Ford. With the war growing incredibly unpopular at home, combined with a severe economic recession and mounting budget deficits, Congress cut funding to South Vietnam for the upcoming fiscal year from 1 billion to 700 million dollars. Historians have attributed the fall of Saigon in 1975 to the cessation of American aid along with the growing disenchantment of the South Vietnamese people and the rampant corruption and incompetence of South Vietnam political leaders and ARVN general staff. Without the necessary funds and facing a collapse in South Vietnamese troop and civilian morale, it was becoming increasingly difficult for the ARVN to achieve a victory against the PAVN. Moreover, the withdrawal of U.S. aid encouraged North Vietnam to begin a new military offensive against South Vietnam. This resolve was strengthened when the new American administration did not think itself bound to this promise Nixon made to Thieu of a \\"severe retaliation\\" if Hanoi broke the 1973 Paris Peace Accords. The fall of Hu·∫ø to PAVN forces on 26 March 1975 began an organized rout of the ARVN that culminated in the complete disintegration of the South Vietnamese government. Withdrawing ARVN forces found the roads choked with refugees making troop movement almost impossible. North Vietnamese forces took advantage of the growing instability, and with the abandoned equipment of the routing ARVN, they mounted heavy attacks on all fronts. With collapse all but inevitable, many ARVN generals abandoned their troops to fend for themselves and ARVN soldiers deserted en masse. The 18th Division held out at Xu√¢n L·ªôc from 9 to 21 April before being forced to withdraw. President Thi·ªáu resigned his office on 21 April and left the country.\\"Flashbacks\\", Morley Safer, Random House / St Martins Press, 1991, p 322 At Bien Hoa, ARVN soldiers made a strong resistance against PAVN forces, however, ARVN defenses at Cu Chi and Hoc Mon start to collapse under the overwhelming PAVN attacks. In the Mekong Delta and Phu Quoc Island, many of ARVN soldiers were aggressive and intact to prevent VC taking over any provincial capitals. Less than a month after Hu·∫ø, Saigon fell and South Vietnam ceased to exist as a political entity. The sudden and complete destruction of the ARVN shocked the world. Even their opponents were surprised at how quickly South Vietnam collapsed. There were hundreds of soldiers, officers, and colonels who committed suicide, making a decision not to live under communism. Five ARVN generals committed suicide during late April to avoid capture by the PAVN/VC and potential reeducation camps. General Le Nguyen Vy committed suicide in Lai Khe shortly after hearing Duong Van Minh surrender from the radio. Both ARVN generals in Can Tho, Le Van Hung and Nguyen Khoa Nam, committed suicide after deciding not to prolong resistance against outnumbered PAVN/VC soldiers in Mekong Region. Brigadier General Tran Van Hai committed suicide by poison at Dong Tam Base Camp. General Pham Van Phu committed suicide at a hospital in Saigon. The U.S. had provided the ARVN with 793,994 M1 carbines, 220,300 M1 Garands and 520 M1C/M1D rifles, 640,000 M-16 rifles, 34,000 M79 grenade launchers, 40,000 radios, 20,000 quarter-ton trucks, 214 M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks, 77 M577 Command tracks (command version of the M113 APC), 930 M113 (APC/ACAVs), 120 V-100s (wheeled armored cars), and 190 M48 tanks. Operations Enhance and Enhance Plus an American effort in November 1972 managed to transfer 59 more M48A3 Patton tanks, 100 additional M-113A1 ACAVs (Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicles), and over 500 extra aircraft to South Vietnam.Starry/Dunstan Despite such impressive figures, the Vietnamese were not as well equipped as the American infantrymen they replaced. The 1972 offensive had been driven back only with a massive American bombing campaign against North Vietnam. The Case‚ÄìChurch Amendment had effectively nullified the Paris Peace Accords, and as a result the United States had cut aid to South Vietnam drastically in 1974, just months before the final enemy offensive, allowing North Vietnam to invade South Vietnam without fear of U.S. military action. As a result, only a little fuel and ammunition were being sent to South Vietnam. South Vietnamese air and ground vehicles were immobilized by lack of spare parts. Troops went into battle without batteries for their radios, and their medics lacked basic supplies. South Vietnamese rifles and artillery pieces were rationed to three rounds of ammunition per day in the last months of the war. Without enough supplies and ammunition, ARVN forces were quickly thrown into chaos and defeated by the well-supplied PAVN, no longer having to worry about U.S. bombing. The victorious Communists sent over 250,000 ARVN soldiers to prison camps wherein they were routinely tortured and murdered some for a period of eleven consecutive years. The communists called these prison camps \\"reeducation camps\\". The Americans and South Vietnamese had laid large minefields during the war, and former ARVN soldiers were made to clear them. Thousands died from sickness and starvation and were buried in unmarked graves. The South Vietnamese national military cemetery was vandalized and abandoned, and a mass grave of ARVN soldiers was made nearby. The charity \\"The Returning Casualty\\" in the early 2000s attempted to excavate and identify remains from some camp graves and restore the cemetery.Excavations of Burial Sites at Vietnamese Re- Education Camps by The Returning Casualty, Julie Martin, MSc in Forensic Archaeology and Anthropology candidate, Cranfield University UK, from southeastasianarchaeology.com Reporter Morley Safer who returned in 1989 and saw the poverty of a former soldier described the ARVN as \\"that wretched army that was damned by the victors, abandoned by its allies, and royally and continuously screwed by its commanders\\".

File:WAFC-ARVN National Armed Forces Day parade 06-19-71.jpgWAFC (Women's Armed Forces Corps) division in the National Armed Forces Day parade, Saigon, June 19, 1971 Formations and units The 1956 army structure of four conventional infantry divisions (8,100 each) and six light divisions (5,800 each) were reorganised according to American advice as seven full infantry divisions (10,450 each) and three corps headquarters by September 1959. The three armed services together numbered around 137,000 in 1960. In face of the communist threat, the army was expanded to 192,000 with four corps, nine divisions, one airborne brigade, one SF group, three separate regiments, one territorial regiment, 86 ranger companies, and 19 separate battalions, as well as support units in 1963, and a force strength of 355,135 in 1970. Meanwhile, the supporting militia forces grew from a combined initial size of 116,000 in 1956, declined to 86,000 in 1959, and then were pushed up to 218,687 RF & 179,015 PF in 1970. The effect of expanding the total land force from about 220,000 in 1960 to around 750,000 in 1970 can be imagined, along with the troop quality issues that resulted. =High Command= Joint General Staff =Corps= * I Corps/CTZ * II Corps/CTZ * III Corps/CTZ * IV Corps/CTZ * 44th Special Tactical Zone =Divisions= * 1st Infantry Division ‚Äì The French formed the 21st Mobile Group in 1953, renamed 21st Division in January 1955, the 1st Division later that year.

The style was once banned at Japanese schools and became a widespread topic of the civic right to self-expression, but discussion of the topic died down due to the ubiquity of the style. Etymology The word Chapatsu is formed from two kanji: , meaning \\"tea\\" and , meaning \\"hair\\". Chapatsu originally referred to a variety of colors of hair dye, including blonde, red, orange, and blue, it now refers to a brown-tea hue. In Japanese the word is also frequently written in hiragana syllabary.  Style  Japanese singer Yumi Yoshimura with a chapatsu. While the style itself began to show up in Tokyo streets during the early to mid-1990s, chapatsu was first described in Imidas, an annual publication of new words and concepts in the Japanese language, in 1997. Chapatsu did not appear in K≈çjien, an authoritative dictionary of the Japanese language, until 1998. The style first gained popularity among adolescent girls, seeking to accentuate their tanned skin (rebelling against more traditional definitions of beauty), but quickly grew into the mainstream.

Bonaduce is the son of veteran TV writer and producer Joseph Bonaduce (The Dick Van Dyke Show, One Day at a Time, and others). Bonaduce became famous as a child actor of the 1970s on the TV sitcom The Partridge Family. He co-starred as Danny Partridge, the wisecracking, redheaded middle son of the singing family band (headed by Shirley Jones), and he played the fictional pop group's bass guitar player. Since then, Bonaduce has starred in several other TV series, including the VH1 reality show Breaking Bonaduce in 2005, radio shows in Los Angeles and Philadelphia and has been hosting a morning talk/music show at Seattle radio station KZOK-FM since November 14, 2011. Early life By his own account, Bonaduce grew up in a dysfunctional family and suffered severe physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his father, TV writer and producer Joseph Bonaduce, while his mother Betty could only stand by helplessly. Career=Acting= Bonaduce as Danny Partridge on the comedy series The Partridge Family, 1970 Bonaduce made a small appearance in the Bewitched's season 5 episode \\"Going Ape\\", which aired on February 27, 1969, as a young boy in the park whose chimpanzee follows Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) and Tabitha (Erin Murphy) home. In The Partridge Family Bonaduce played the role of Danny Partridge, a member of the musical Partridge family. In the show, the Partridges were a family band that toured the country in their hip, Mondrian-inspired, painted school bus. Danny Partridge played bass guitar for the band and his younger siblings, Tracy and Chris, contributed to the band as percussionists. The series ran for four seasons, from 1970 to 1974 and, in 2003, Bonaduce was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Former Child Star \\"Lifetime Achievement\\" Award for his role on the series. Bonaduce made several movies during and after the run of The Partridge Family, including Corvette Summer (1978) starring Mark Hamill. Hamill and Bonaduce played high school students who went in search of a stolen customized Corvette Stingray. Bonaduce also made guest appearances on several TV shows, including the television action drama CHiPs. His career withered in the early 1980s. Bonaduce and Partridge Family co-star Dave Madden made cameo appearances in a 1994 episode of Married... with Children. That same year, he appeared on an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. He has also guest-starred in the first two episodes of the seventh season of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and as the son of Shirley Jones's character in the fourth season of The Drew Carey Show. Bonaduce has appeared as himself on the detective series Monk and on the show Girlfriends. Bonaduce guest-starred with J. D. Roth (with whom he would later reunite for Breaking Bonaduce) on a celebrity episode of Sex Wars. In 1999, Bonaduce appeared in the Christmas episode, \\"Sabrina, Nipping at Your Nose\\", of Sabrina, the Teenage Witch. During his radio work, Bonaduce was the host of the segment \\"Bonaduce's Buzz\\" as part of WMAQ-TV's morning newscast First Thing in The Morning with Art Norman and Allison Rosati in 1994; but he left the station the following year to concentrate on his syndicated talk show. During the 1995‚Äì96 TV season, Bonaduce was the host of Danny!, a syndicated talk show featuring the house band The Critics. From 2001 to 2003, Bonaduce co-hosted The Other Half, a daytime talk show positioned as a complementary show to The View, on which he starred with Mario Lopez, Dick Clark, and cosmetic surgeon Dr. Jan Adams (who was later replaced by actor Dorian Gregory). During this time, he was also a Hollywood correspondent for the Australian morning show Today. In 2005, Bonaduce starred in Breaking Bonaduce a VH1 reality show about his turbulent life with his wife Gretchen. In 2006, he had a recurring role in the crime scene drama CSI as a character known as Izzy Delancy ‚Äì a once great, but philandering, rock star, the victim of the infamous miniature killer. He also hosted the short-lived tabloid- themed game show Starface, on Game Show Network. In 2007, Bonaduce was both host and judge of the show I Know My Kid's a Star, a reality show on VH1 featuring parents and children trying to break into show business. He also appeared as a judge on the Australian version of the show, My Kid's a Star. Bonaduce, admitting his own less-than-stellar track record, was a commentator for TruTV's TruTV Presents: World's Dumbest... from 2008 to 2013. =Radio and music= Bonaduce's self-titled debut LP was released in 1973 by Lion Records, a subsidiary label of MGM Records. The single from the album, \\"Dreamland\\" was a minor hit. In the late 1980s, Bonaduce had become an on-air radio personality. He worked an overnight shift at Philadelphia's WEGX-FM. From 1994 to 1996, Bonaduce hosted his own radio show, The Danny Bonaduce Show on The Loop WLUP in Chicago. Between 1996 and 1998, Bonaduce hosted a morning radio show in Detroit on WKQI with comedian and Last Comic Standing winner John Heffron. In 1998 Bonaduce was the morning show host for New York City's Big 105 WBIX for a brief period. Bonaduce was part of The Adam Carolla Show in 2007. In 2008 he was given a daily one-hour solo spot known as Broadcasting Bonaduce, which was broadcast locally on the L.A.-based KLSX station. In February 2009, it was announced that the station had changed its format from talk to Top 40, and the removal of Broadcasting Bonaduce from the KLSX schedule was confirmed. On October 31, 2011, it was announced by Seattle radio station 102.5 KZOK that Bonaduce would be co-hosting their morning-drive show beginning on November 14, 2011. Bonaduce came to Seattle from a radio stint at 94 WYSP in Philadelphia, following a format change from classic rock to all sports radio in September 2011. Bonaduce is an ordained minister; he was ordained online in order to perform a wedding ceremony as part of a 94WYSP radio promotion in early 2011. =Altercation with Jonny Fairplay= On October 2, 2007, Bonaduce was involved in an altercation with Survivor show participant Jonny Fairplay during the Fox Reality Awards. Toward the end of the awards show, Fairplay appeared onstage and was booed by the audience. Bonaduce walked on stage and explained that the audience reaction was \\"because they hate you.\\" Bonaduce was walking off the stage as Fairplay called him back. Fairplay then jumped on Bonaduce to hug him and Bonaduce stated later that he was uncomfortable with Fairplay's hands near his throat. Bonaduce, a black belt in Tang Soo Do, adjusted his balance and grip, and threw Fairplay over his head. Fairplay fell to the floor, face first, unable to halt his fall with his hands due to the microphone he was holding. Fairplay stood up after a few moments and staggered before slowly walking off stage, his back to the audience. Bonaduce then smiled and proceeded to make faces and exaggerated shrugging motions at the audience before walking off stage. Bonaduce later said the two had never previously had any negative altercations or words, but that they had met occasionally in the past. He said he had never liked Fairplay, mostly because Fairplay, true to his form, had lied about his grandmother's death during his first run on Survivor. While Bonaduce did not believe Fairplay was significantly hurt at the time, TMZ.com confirmed that Fairplay bled significantly, lost some teeth and suffered a broken toe. Fairplay pressed charges, and a felony battery investigation was opened by the police. On October 5, 2007, the L.A. District Attorney's office concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove Bonaduce had committed battery, because the contact had been initiated by Fairplay and Bonaduce had acted in self-defense. =Boxing and wrestling= As an adult, Bonaduce boxed Donny Osmond and former Brady Barry Williams in separate charity events. Bonaduce won both fights, gaining a decision over Osmond and a TKO over Williams. On June 11, 2007, it was announced that Bonaduce would box attorney Robert Shapiro for a charitable event. On September 13, 2008, Bonaduce defeated \\"Reverend\\" Bob Levy by a TKO in the second one-minute round of a planned three-round fight. Prior to the event, Levy had slapped Bonaduce while visiting Bonaduce's dressing room. It was announced in early January 2009 that Bonaduce would box retired baseball player Jos√© Canseco at a charity event in the Philadelphia area. Bonaduce reportedly trained for the fight in Sacramento, California with boxer Angelo N√∫√±ez. On January 24, 2009, Bonaduce and Canseco fought to a majority draw. In April 1994, it was announced that Bonaduce would be making his professional wrestling debut in a \\"dark match\\" at the Spring Stampede in Chicago. On April 17, 1994, Bonaduce stepped into the ring at the Rosemont Horizon. His opponent was another 1970s TV star, the Brady Bunch's Christopher Knight. Bonaduce won. Bonaduce had his second professional wrestling match at Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's April pay- per-view event Lockdown against Eric Young, which he lost. Bonaduce was a key player in the series Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling. =Writing= In 2002, Bonaduce released an autobiography, Random Acts of Badness. Personal life Bonaduce has a black belt in karate.\\"The Partridge Famiy Tree,\\" SPIN, Sep 1990, p. 68 Bonaduce married his first wife, Setsuko Hattori in 1985, and they divorced in 1988. On November 4, 1990, Bonaduce met second wife Gretchen Hillmer on a blind date and, on a whim, they married the same day. Despite the unusual start to the marriage, the two remained married for over sixteen years and had two children together, Isabella and Dante. On April 9, 2007, the two divorced, citing irreconcilable differences. Bonaduce began dating his current wife, Amy Railsback, in April 2007. They met at a Starbucks in the Los Angeles area. Railsback, who is 23 years his junior, is a former substitute school teacher. She now manages Bonaduce's career full-time, runs Gravel Tones Productions Inc, and is occasionally seen in sketches on The Smoking Gun Presents: World's Dumbest... on truTV. He proposed to Amy in March 2009, and the couple married on November 22, 2010, at the Four Seasons on Maui, Hawaii. They maintain homes in both Los Angeles and in Seattle. Bonaduce and David Cassidy, his The Partridge Family costar, remained close friends until Cassidy's death on November 21, 2017. On January 20, 2018, Bonaduce attended Cassidy's memorial service in Los Angeles. Bonaduce also met actress Shirley Jones on the set of The Partridge Family. Jones often allowed Bonaduce to stay at her home in order to avoid his difficult home life. According to Jones, Bonaduce was \\"smart\\" and \\"talented\\" but a troublemaker off-camera, who \\"was still a kid and would do kid things like get a dish of food and throw it across the room or have a pillow fight\\". Bonaduce later commented that \\"Shirley Jones could not have been kinder to me\\". =Arrests= On March 9, 1990, he was arrested while attempting to buy cocaine in Daytona Beach, Florida. Bonaduce was there to host an event for D.A.R.E., an anti-drug campaign aimed at children. Bonaduce was eventually fired from WEGX. He later became the morning shift DJ at KKFR-FM in Phoenix, Arizona. On March 31, 1991, Bonaduce was arrested in Phoenix for beating and robbing Darius Barney, a transvestite prostitute; \\"authorities said the victim suffered a broken nose and a cut to his face.\\" Soon after, he was fired from KKFR. In July of the same year, Bonaduce pleaded guilty to reduced charges. Amongst his punishments, he was required to pay Barney's medical bills. Later that same year, Bonaduce returned to WEGX in Philadelphia. =Political views= Bonaduce has expressed his mostly conservative political views during guest appearances. He is a strong supporter of capital punishment and a strong military. Several controversial statements have been made by Bonaduce regarding left-wing or liberal celebrities, such as his remarks that Jane Fonda should have been shot for treason for her role in support of the North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. He also stated on MSNBC's Scarborough Country that \\"personally I think at this point if anyone had a rope thick enough, I think that Rosie should be strung up for treason\\", referring to Rosie O'Donnell.

It was eventually extended from piano, to piano duo and trio, guitar, big band, country and western music, and gospel. While standard blues traditionally expresses a variety of emotions, boogie-woogie is mainly associated with dancing. The lyrics of one of the earliest hits, \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\", consist entirely of instructions to dancers: Musical features Boogie-woogie is characterized by a regular left-hand bass figure, which is transposed following the chord changes. :Another : Boogie-woogie is not strictly a solo piano style; it can accompany singers and be featured in orchestras and small combos. It is sometimes called \\"eight to the bar\\", as much of it is written in common time () time using eighth notes (quavers) (see time signature). The chord progressions are typically based on I ‚Äì IV ‚Äì V ‚Äì I (with many formal variations of it, such as I/i ‚Äì IV/iv ‚Äì v/I, as well as chords that lead into these ones). For the most part, boogie-woogie tunes are twelve-bar blues, although the style has been applied to popular songs such as \\"Swanee River\\" and hymns such as \\"Just a Closer Walk with Thee\\". Typical boogie-woogie bassline: :Typical boogie-woogie bassline on 12 bar blues progression in G : History=1870s‚Äì1930s= Several African terms have been suggested as having some interesting linguistic precursors to \\"boogie\\": Among them are the: # Hausa word \\"Boog\\", and # Mandingo word \\"Booga\\" (both of which mean \\"to beat\\", as in beating a drum) # West African word \\"Bogi\\" (which means \\"to dance\\")The South Bank Show (UK television series), episode on Boogie Woogie, 1986, with commentary by Paul Oliver. # Bantu term \\"Mbuki Mvuki\\" (Mbuki: \\"to take off in flight\\"; Mvuki: \\"to dance wildly, as if to shake off one's clothes\\").They Have a Word for It: A Lighthearted Lexicon of Untranslatable Words and Phrases, by Howard Rheingold, Published 2000 by Sarabande Books. The African origin of these terms is consistent with the African-American origin of the music. In sheet music literature prior to 1900, there are at least three examples of the word \\"boogie\\" in music titles in the archives of the Library of Congress.Liner Notes (p. 20), written by Jean-Christophe Averty, for CD album, Original Boogie Woogie by Claude Bolling, 1968, Universal Music S.A.S., France. In 1901, \\"Hoogie Boogie\\" appeared in the title of published sheet music, the first known instance where a redoubling of the word \\"Boogie\\" occurs in the title of published music. (In 1880, \\"The Boogie Man\\" had occurred as the title of published music.) The first use of \\"Boogie\\" in a recording title appears to be a \\"blue cylinder\\" recording made by Edison of the \\"American Quartet\\" performing \\"That Syncopated Boogie Boo\\" in 1913. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the word is a reduplication of boogie, which was used for \\"rent parties\\" as early as 1913. \\"Boogie\\" next occurs in the title of Wilbur Sweatman's April 1917 recording of \\"Boogie Rag\\". None of these sheet music or audio recording examples contain the musical elements that would identify them as boogie-woogie. The 1919 recordings (two takes) of \\"Weary Blues\\" by the Louisiana Five contained the same boogie-woogie bass figure as appears in the 1915 \\"Weary Blues\\" sheet music by Artie Matthews. Tennison has recognized these 1919 recordings as the earliest sound recordings which contain a boogie-woogie bass figure. Blind Lemon Jefferson used the term \\"Booga Rooga\\" to refer to a guitar bass figure that he used in \\"Match Box Blues\\".Price, Sammy, What Do They Want? (autobiography), 1990, University of Illinois Press. Jefferson may have heard the term from Huddie \\"Lead Belly\\" Ledbetter, who played frequently with Jefferson. Lead Belly, who was born in Mooringsport, La., and grew up in Harrison County, Texas, in the community of Leigh, said he first heard boogie-woogie piano in the Caddo Lake area of northeast Texas in 1899.Borneman, Ernest, Chapter 2. \\"Boogie Woogie\\" (pp. 13‚Äì40), in Sinclair Traill and The Hon Gerald Lascelles (eds), Just Jazz, published 1957 for Peter Davies Ltd by The Windmill Press, Kingswood, Surrey, UK. He said it influenced his guitar-playing. Lead Belly also said he heard boogie-woogie piano in the Fannin Street district of Shreveport, Louisiana. Some of the players he heard were Dave Alexander, who recorded for Decca in 1937 as \\"Black Ivory King,\\" and a piano player called Pine Top (not Pine Top Smith, who was not born until 1904, but possibly Pine Top Williams or Pine Top Hill.)Russell, Ross, \\"Illuminating The Leadbelly Legend\\", Down Beat, August 6, 1970, Vol. 37, No. 15. Lead Belly was among the first guitar-players to adapt the rolling bass of boogie-woogie piano. Texas, as the state of origin, became reinforced by Jelly Roll Morton, who said he heard the boogie piano style there early in the 20th century, as did Leadbelly and Bunk Johnson, according to Rosetta Reitz.Liner Notes by Rosetta Reitz for Album: Boogie Blues: Women Sing and Play Boogie Woogie, 1983, Rosetta Records, New York, NY. The first time the modern-day spelling of \\"boogie-woogie\\" was used in a title of a published audio recording of music appears to be Pine Top Smith's December 1928 recording titled \\"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\\", a song whose lyrics contain dance instructions to \\"boogie-woogie\\". The earliest documented inquiries into the geographical origin of boogie-woogie occurred in the late 1930s when oral histories from the oldest living Americans of both African and European descent revealed a broad consensus that boogie-woogie piano was first played in Texas in the early 1870s. Additional citations place the origins of boogie- woogie in the Piney Woods of northeast Texas. \\"Fast Western\\" connection to Marshall & Harrison County, Texas Max Harrison (in the book Jazz edited by Hentoff and McCarthy in 1959) and Mack McCormick (in the liner notes to his Treasury of Field Recordings, Vol. 2) concluded that \\"Fast Western\\" was the first term by which boogie-woogie was known. Also, \\"In Houston, Dallas, and Galveston ‚Äî all Negro piano players played that way. This style was often referred to as a 'fast western' or 'fast blues' as differentiated from the 'slow blues' of New Orleans and St. Louis. At these gatherings the ragtime and blues boys could easily tell from what section of the country a man came, even going so far as to name the town, by his interpretation of a piece.\\"Campbell, E. Simms Campbell, Jazzmen: The Story of Hot Jazz Told in the Lives of the Men Who Created It, 1939, Chapter 4: \\"Blues\\", pp. 112‚Äì113. According to Tennison, when he interviewed Lee Ree Sullivan in Texarkana in 1986, Sullivan told him that he was familiar with \\"Fast Western\\" and \\"Fast Texas\\" as terms to refer to boogie-woogie in general, but not to denote the use of any specific bass figure used in boogie-woogie. Sullivan said that \\"Fast Western\\" and \\"Fast Texas\\" were terms that derived from the \\"Texas Western\\" Railroad Company of Harrison County.Interview with Lee Ree Sullivan, Boogie Woogie pianist, 1986, Texarkana, AR-TX, by John Tennison and Alfred Tennison, Jr. The company was formed on February 16, 1852, but did not build track from Swanson's Landing at Caddo Lake to Marshall, Texas, until after changing its name to \\"Southern Pacific\\" on August 16, 1856. This Texas-based \\"Southern Pacific\\" was the first \\"Southern Pacific\\" railroad, and was not connected to the more well known \\"Southern Pacific\\" originating in San Francisco, California. The Texas-based Southern Pacific Railroad was bought out by the newly formed Texas and Pacific Railway on March 21, 1872. Although the \\"Texas Western\\" Railroad Company changed its name to \\"Southern Pacific\\", Sullivan said the name \\"Texas Western\\" stuck among the slaves who constructed the first railway hub in northeast Texas from Swanson's Landing to the city of Marshall. Railroad connection to Marshall & Harrison County, Texas A key to identifying the geographical area in which boogie-woogie originated is understanding the relationship of boogie-woogie music with the steam railroad, both in the sense of how the music might have been influenced by sounds associated with the arrival of steam locomotives as well as the cultural impact the sudden emergence of the railroad might have had. The railroad did not \\"arrive\\" in northeast Texas as an extension of track from existing lines from the north or the east. Rather, the first railroad locomotives and iron rails were brought to northeast Texas via steamboats from New Orleans via the Mississippi and Red Rivers and Caddo Lake to Swanson's Landing, located on the Louisiana/Texas state line. Beginning with the formation of the Texas Western Railroad Company in Marshall, Texas, through the subsequent establishment in 1871 of the Texas and Pacific Railway company, which located its headquarters and shops there, Marshall was the only railroad hub in the Piney Woods of northeast Texas at the time the music developed. The sudden appearance of steam locomotives, and the building of mainline tracks and tap lines to serve logging operations was pivotal to the creation of the music in terms of its sound and rhythm. It was also crucial to the rapid migration of the musical style from the rural barrel house camps to the cities and towns served by the Texas and Pacific Railway Company. \\"Although the neighboring states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri would also produce boogie-woogie players and their boogie-woogie tunes, and despite the fact that Chicago would become known as the center for this music through such pianists as Jimmy Yancey, Albert Ammons, and Meade \\"Lux\\" Lewis, Texas was home to an environment that fostered creation of boogie-style: the lumber, cattle, turpentine, and oil industries, all served by an expanding railway system from the northern corner of East Texas to the Gulf Coast and from the Louisiana border to Dallas and West Texas.\\"David Oliphant, Texan Jazz, University of Texas Press, 1996, p. 75. Alan Lomax wrote: \\"Anonymous black musicians, longing to grab a train and ride away from their troubles, incorporated the rhythms of the steam locomotive and the moan of their whistles into the new dance music they were playing in jukes and dance halls. Boogie-woogie forever changed piano playing, as ham-handed black piano players transformed the instrument into a polyrhythmic railroad train.\\"Alan Lomax, Chapter 4, Lonesome Whistles, p. 170, The Land Where the Blues Began, New York, NY:The New Press, 1993. In the 1986 television broadcast of Britain's The South Bank Show about boogie-woogie, music historian Paul Oliver noted: \\"Now the conductors were used to the logging camp pianists clamoring aboard, telling them a few stories, jumping off the train, getting into another logging camp, and playing again for eight hours, barrel house. In this way the music got around‚Äîall through Texas‚Äîand eventually, of course, out of Texas. Now when this new form of piano music came from Texas, it moved out towards Louisiana. It was brought by people like George W. Thomas, an early pianist who was already living in New Orleans by about 1910 and writing \\"New Orleans Hop Scop Blues\\", which really has some of the characteristics of the music that we came to know as Boogie.\\" Paul Oliver also wrote that George W. Thomas \\"composed the theme of the New Orleans Hop Scop Blues ‚Äì in spite of its title ‚Äì based on the blues he had heard played by the pianists of East Texas.\\"Oliver, Paul, The Story of the Blues, London, 1969, p. 85. On February 12, 2007, Oliver confirmed to John Tennison that it was Sippie Wallace who told Oliver that performances by East Texas pianists had formed the basis for George Thomas's \\"Hop Scop Blues\\".Interview with Paul Oliver by John Tennison, February 12, 2007. George Thomas and his brother Hersal Thomas migrated from Texas to Chicago, and brought boogie-woogie with them. They were an immense influence on other pianists, including Jimmy Yancey, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons and many others. Many elements that we now know as elements of boogie- woogie are present in Hersal and George Thomas' \\"The Fives\\". According to Tennison, \\"although some Boogie Woogie bass figures were present in prior sheet music, the thing that made 'The Fives' so special was the greater amount and variety of Boogie Woogie bass figures that were present in the music as compared to Boogie Woogie bass figures that had been present in previously published sheet music, such as the 1915 \\"Weary Blues\\" by Artie Matthews. \\"Albert Ammons and Meade 'Lux' Lewis claim that 'The Fives,' [copyrighted in 1921 and published in 1922] the Thomas brothers' musical composition, deserves much credit for the development of modern boogie-woogie. During the 1920s, many pianists featured this number as a 'get off' tune and in the variations played what is now considered boogie-woogie.\\"\\"5 Boogie Woogie Piano Solos by All-Star Composers\\" (a book of sheet music), Copyright 1942, edited by Frank Paparelli, Leeds Music Corporation, RKO Building, Radio City, New York, NY. Indeed, all modern boogie-woogie bass figures can be found in \\"The Fives\\", including swinging, walking broken-octave bass, shuffled (swinging) chord bass (of the sort later used extensively by Ammons, Lewis, and Clarence \\"Pine Top\\" Smith), and the ubiquitous \\"oom-pah\\" ragtime stride bass. T&P; stops associated with names for boogie-woogie left-hand bass lines Early generation boogie-woogie players recognized basic boogie-woogie bass lines by geographical locations with which they associated them. Lee Ree Sullivan identified a number of these left hand bass lines for Tennison in 1986. From the primitive to the complex, those identifications indicate that the most primitive form of the music was associated with Marshall, Texas ‚Äì and that the left-hand bass lines grew more complex as the distance from Marshall increased. The most primitive of these left hand bass lines is the one that was called \\"the Marshall\\". It is a simple, four-beats-to-the-bar figure The second-most primitive bass-line, called \\"the Jefferson\\", is also four-beats- to-the-bar, but goes down in pitch on the last note in each four-note cycle. It has been suggested that this downturn in pitch reveals a possible New Orleans influence. Jefferson, Texas, about 17 miles north of Marshall, was the westernmost port of a steamboat route that connected to New Orleans via Caddo Lake, the Red River, and the Mississippi River. The remaining bass lines rise in complexity with distance from Marshall, Texas as one would expect variations and innovations would occur as the territory in which the music has been introduced expands. Indications that Marshall & Harrison County Texas is the most likely point of origination of boogie-woogie In January 2010, John Tennison summarized his research into the origins of boogie-woogie with the conclusion that Marshall, Texas is \\"the municipality whose boundaries are most likely to encompass or be closest to the point on the map which is the geographic center of gravity for all instances of Boogie Woogie performance between 1870 and 1880\\". Tennison states: \\"Given the account of Elliot Paul, and given that Lead Belly witnessed boogie-woogie in 1899 in the Arklatex; and given the North to South migration of the Thomas family; and given the Texas & Pacific headquarters in Marshall in the early 1870s; and given that Harrison County had the largest slave population in the state of Texas; and given the fact that the best-documented and largest-scale turpentine camps in Texas did not occur until after 1900 in Southeast Texas, it is most probable that boogie-woogie spread from Northeast to Southeast Texas, rather than from Southeast to Northeast Texas, or by having developed diffusely with an even density over all of the Piney Woods of East Texas. It would not be surprising if there was as yet undiscovered evidence of the earliest boogie-woogie performances buried (metaphorically or literally) in Northeast Texas.\\" On May 13, 2010, the Marshall City Commission enacted an official declaration naming Marshall as the \\"birthplace\\" of boogie-woogie music, and embarked on a program to encourage additional historical research and to stimulate interest in and appreciation for the early African-American culture in northeast Texas that played a vital role in creating boogie-woogie music.Lee Hancock, Dallas Morning News, June 18, 2010. The city of Marshall, Texas is committed to cooperating with any and all efforts to unearth boogie-woogie history and to honor, celebrate, and re-create the vibrant environment that was catalytic to the creation of the most entertaining, revolutionary, and influential of all American musical forms. \\"Birthplace of Boogie Woogie\\" was registered by the Marshall Convention and Visitors on June 21, 2011 (registration number 3,980,563; Ser. No. 85-064,442, Filed 6-16-2010). Development of modern boogie-woogie A song titled \\"Tin Roof Blues\\" was published in 1923 by the Clarence Williams Publishing Company. Compositional credit is given to Richard M. Jones. The Jones composition uses a boogie bass in the introduction with some variation throughout. In February 1923, Joseph Samuels' Tampa Blue Jazz Band recorded the George W. Thomas number \\"The Fives\\" for Okeh Records, considered the first example of jazz band boogie-woogie. Jimmy Blythe's recording of \\"Chicago Stomps\\" from April 1924 is sometimes called the first complete boogie-woogie piano solo record. The first boogie-woogie hit was \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\" by Pinetop Smith, recorded in 1928 and first released in 1929. Smith's record was the first boogie-woogie recording to be a commercial hit, and helped establish \\"boogie-woogie\\" as the name of the style. It was closely followed by another example of pure boogie-woogie, \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues\\" by Meade Lux Lewis, recorded by Paramount Records(1927), first released in March 1930. The performance emulated a railroad trip, perhaps lending credence to the \\"train theory\\". =Late 1930s: Carnegie Hall= Boogie-woogie gained further public attention in 1938 and 1939, thanks to the From Spirituals to Swing concerts in Carnegie Hall promoted by record producer John Hammond. The concerts featured Big Joe Turner and Pete Johnson performing Turner's tribute to Johnson, \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\", as well as Meade Lux Lewis performing \\"Honky Tonk Train Blues\\" and Albert Ammons playing \\"Swanee River Boogie\\". \\"Roll 'Em Pete\\" is now considered to be an early rock and roll song. These three pianists, with Turner, took up residence in the Caf√© Society night club in New York City where they were popular with the sophisticated set. They often played in combinations of two and even three pianos, creating a richly textured piano performance. =1930s‚Äì1940s: Swing= After the Carnegie Hall concerts, it was only natural for swing bands to incorporate the boogie-woogie beat into some of their music. Tommy Dorsey's band recorded an updated version of \\"Pine Top's Boogie Woogie\\" in 1938, which (as \\"Boogie Woogie\\") became a hit in 1943 and 1945, and was to become the swing era's second best seller, only second to Glenn Miller's \\"In the Mood\\". In 1939, at the suggestion of Columbia Records producer John Hammond, Harry James recorded the singles Boo-Woo and Woo-Woo with Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. Also from 1939, the Will Bradley orchestra had a string of boogie hits such as the original versions of \\"Beat Me Daddy (Eight To The Bar)\\" and \\"Down the Road a Piece\\", both 1940, and \\"Scrub Me Mamma With A Boogie Beat\\", in 1941. The Andrews Sisters sang some boogies, and after the floodgates were open, it was expected that every big band should have one or two boogie numbers in their repertoire. Derivative forms In 1939 country artists began playing boogie-woogie when Johnny Barfield recorded \\"Boogie Woogie\\". \\"Cow Cow Boogie\\" was written for, but not used in, the 1942 movie Ride 'em Cowboy. This song by Benny Carter, Gene DePaul, and Don Raye successfully combined boogie-woogie and Western, or cowboy music. The lyrics leave no doubt that it was a Western boogie-woogie. It sold over a million records in its original release by Ella Mae Morse and Freddie Slack, and has now been recorded many times. The trickle of what was initially called hillbilly boogie, or Okie boogie (later to be renamed country boogie), became a flood beginning around late 1945. One notable country boogie from this period was the Delmore Brothers \\"Freight Train Boogie\\", considered to be part of the combined evolution of country music and blues towards rockabilly. In 1948 Arthur Smith achieved Top 10 US country chart success with his MGM Records recordings of \\"Guitar Boogie\\" and \\"Banjo Boogie\\", with the former crossing over to the US pop chart, introducing many people to the potential of the electric guitar. The hillbilly boogie period lasted into the 1950s, the last recordings of this era were made by Tennessee Ernie Ford with Cliffie Stone and his orchestra with the great guitar duo Jimmy Bryant and Speedy West. Bill Haley and the Saddlemen recorded two boogies in 1951. The boogie beat continued in country music through the end of the 20th century. The Charlie Daniels Band (whose earlier tune \\"The South's Gonna Do It Again\\" uses boogie-woogie influences) released \\"Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues\\" in 1988, and three years later in 1991 Brooks & Dunn had a huge hit with \\"Boot Scootin' Boogie\\". More representative examples can be found in some of the songs of Western swing pioneer Bob Wills, and subsequent tradition-minded country artists such as Asleep at the Wheel, Merle Haggard, and George Strait. The popularity of the Carnegie Hall concerts meant work for many of the fellow boogie players and also led to the adaptation of boogie-woogie sounds to many other forms of music. Tommy Dorsey's band had a hit with \\"T.D.'s Boogie Woogie\\" as arranged by Sy Oliver and soon there were boogie-woogie songs, recorded and printed, of many different stripes. Most famously, in the big- band genre, the ubiquitous \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\", which was revamped by Christina Aguilera as her 2006 hit, \\"Candyman\\". In the many styles of blues, especially Chicago blues and (more recently) West Coast blues, some pianists and guitarists were influenced by, and employed, the traditional boogie-woogie styles. Some of the earliest and most influential were Big Maceo Merriweather and Sunnyland Slim. Otis Spann and Pinetop Perkins, two of the best known blues pianists, are heavily boogie-woogie influenced, with the latter taking both his name and signature tune from Pinetop Smith. The boogie-woogie fad lasted from the late 1930s into the early 1950s,Palmer, Robert, Deep Blues, 1981, p. 130. and made a major contribution to the development of jump blues and ultimately to rock and roll, epitomized by Fats Domino, Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis. Louis Jordan is famous jump blues musician. Boogie-woogie is still to be heard in clubs and on records throughout Europe and North America. Big Joe Duskin displayed on his 1979 album, Cincinnati Stomp, a command of piano blues and boogie-woogie, which he had absorbed at first hand in the 1940s from Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson. In Western classical music, the composer Conlon Nancarrow was also deeply influenced by boogie-woogie, as many of his early works for player piano demonstrate. \\"A Wonderful Time Up There\\" is a boogie-woogie gospel song. In 1943, Morton Gould composed Boogie-Woogie Etude for classical pianist Jos√© Iturbi, who premiered and recorded it that year. Povel Ramel's first hit in 1944 was Johanssons boogie-woogie-vals where he mixed boogie-woogie with waltz. 21st-century commentators have also noted the characteristics of boogie-woogie in the third variation of the second movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 32, written between 1821 and 1822.

With the industrial revolution, but particularly in the 20th century, mass production led to overproduction‚Äîthe supply of goods would grow beyond consumer demand, and so manufacturers turned to planned obsolescence and advertising to manipulate consumer spending. In 1899, a book on consumerism published by Thorstein Veblen, called The Theory of the Leisure Class, examined the widespread values and economic institutions emerging along with the widespread \\"leisure time\\" in the beginning of the 20th century.Veblen, Thorstein (1899): The Theory of the Leisure Class: an economic study of institutions, Dover Publications, Mineola, N.Y., 1994, . (also available: Project Gutenberg e-text) In it, Veblen \\"views the activities and spending habits of this leisure class in terms of conspicuous and vicarious consumption and waste. Both are related to the display of status and not to functionality or usefulness.\\"bookrags.com, The Theory of the Leisure Class: Summary & Study Guide Description In economics, consumerism may refer to economic policies which emphasise consumption. In an abstract sense, it is the consideration that the free choice of consumers should strongly orient the choice by manufacturers of what is produced and how, and therefore orient the economic organization of a society (compare producerism, especially in the British sense of the term).\\"Consumerism\\". Britannica Concise Encyclopedia Online. 2008. In this sense, consumerism expresses the idea not of \\"one man, one voice\\", but of \\"one pound, one voice\\", which may or may not reflect the contribution of people to society. Term The term consumerism has several definitions., which is based on These definitions may not be related to each other and confusingly, they conflict with each other. #One sense of the term relates to efforts to support consumers' interests. By the early 1970s it had become the accepted term for the field and began to be used in these ways: ##Consumerism is the concept that consumers should be informed decision makers in the marketplace. In this sense consumerism is the study and practice of matching consumers with trustworthy information, such as product testing reports. ##Consumerism is the concept that the marketplace itself is responsible for ensuring social justice through fair economic practices. Consumer protection policies and laws compel manufacturers to make products safe. ##Consumerism refers to the field of studying, regulating, or interacting with the marketplace. The consumer movement is the social movement which refers to all actions and all entities within the marketplace which give consideration to the consumer. #While the above definitions were becoming established, other people began using the term consumerism to mean \\"high levels of consumption\\". This definition has gained popularity since the 1970s and began to be used in these ways: ##Consumerism is the selfish and frivolous collecting of products, or economic materialism. In this sense consumerism is negative and in opposition to positive lifestyles of anti-consumerism and simple living. ##Consumerism is a force from the marketplace which destroys individuality and harms society. It is related to globalization and in protest against this some people promote the \\"anti-globalization movement\\". In a 1955 speech, John Bugas (number two at the Ford Motor Company) coined the term consumerism as a substitute for capitalism to better describe the American economy: Bugas's definition aligned with Austrian economics founder Carl Menger's vision (in his 1871 book Principles of Economics) of consumer sovereignty, whereby consumer preferences, valuations, and choices control the economy entirely (a concept directly opposed to the Marxian perception of the capitalist economy as a system of exploitation). Vance Packard worked to change the meaning of the term consumerism from a positive word about consumer practices to a negative word meaning excessive materialism and waste. The ads for his 1960 book The Waste Makers prominently featured the word consumerism in a negative way. History=Origins= The consumer society emerged in the late seventeenth century and intensified throughout the eighteenth century. Compare: While some claim that change was propelled by the growing middle-class who embraced new ideas about luxury consumption and about the growing importance of fashion as an arbiter for purchasing rather than necessity, many critics argue that consumerism was a political and economic necessity for the reproduction of capitalist competition for markets and profits, while others point to the increasing political strength of international working-class organizations during a rapid increase in technological productivity and decline in necessary scarcity as a catalyst to develop a consumer culture based on therapeutic entertainments, home-ownership and debt. The \\"middle-class\\" view argues that this revolution encompassed the growth in construction of vast country estates specifically designed to cater for comfort and the increased availability of luxury goods aimed at a growing market. Such luxury goods included sugar, tobacco, tea and coffee; these were increasingly grown on vast plantations (historically by slave labor) in the Caribbean as demand steadily rose. In particular, sugar consumption in Britain during the course of the 18th century increased by a factor of 20. Critics argue that colonialism did indeed help drive consumerism, but they would place the emphasis on the supply rather than the demand as the motivating factor. An increasing mass of exotic imports as well as domestic manufactures had to be consumed by the same number of people who had been consuming far less than was becoming necessary. Historically, the notion that high levels of consumption of consumer goods is the same thing as achieving success or even freedom did not precede large-scale capitalist production and colonial imports. That idea was produced later, more or less strategically, in order to intensify consumption domestically and to make resistant cultures more flexible to extend its reach. =Culture of consumption= Bernard Mandeville's work Fable of the Bees, which justified conspicuous consumption The pattern of intensified consumption became particularly visible in London where the gentry and prosperous merchants took up residence and promoted a culture of luxury and consumption that slowly extended across socio-economic boundaries. Marketplaces expanded as shopping centres, such as the New Exchange, opened in 1609 by Robert Cecil in the Strand. Shops started to become important as places for Londoners to meet and socialise and became popular destinations alongside the theatre. From 1660, Restoration London also saw the growth of luxury buildings as advertisements for social position, with speculative architects like Nicholas Barbon and Lionel Cranfield operating. Industries like glass making and silk manufacturing grew, and much pamphleteering of the time justified the private vice for luxury goods as promoting the greater public good. This then-scandalous line of thought caused great controversy with the publication of the influential work Fable of the Bees in 1714, in which Bernard Mandeville argued that a country's prosperity ultimately lay in the self-interest of the consumer. Advertising plays a major role in fostering a consumerist society, marketing goods through various platforms in nearly all aspects of human life, and pushing the message that the potential customer's personal life requires some product. Consumerism is discussed in detail in the textbook Media in Everyday Life. The authors write, \\"Consumerism is deeply integrated into the daily life and the visual culture of the societies in which we live, often in ways that we do not even recognize\\" (Smulyan 266). She continues, \\"Thus even products that are sold as exemplifying tradition and heritage, such as Quaker Oats cereal, are marketed through constantly changing advertising messages\\" (Smulyan 266). Advertising changes with the consumer in order to keep up with their target, identifying their needs and their associations of brands and products before the viewer is consciously aware. Mediums through which individuals are exposed to ads change and grow continuously as marketers try to get in touch with their audience and adapt to ways to keep audience attention. For example, billboards, invented around the time that the automobile became prevalent in society, aimed to provide audiences with short details about a brand or a \\"catch phrase\\" that a driver could spot, recognize, and remember (Smulyan 273). In the 21st century there is an extreme focus on technology and the digitization of culture. Much of the advertising takes place in cohesive campaigns through various mediums that make ignoring companies' messages very difficult. Aram Sinnreich writes about the relationship between online advertisers and publishers and how it has been strengthened by the digitization of media, as consumers' data is always being collected through their online activity (Sinnreich 3). In this way consumers are targeted based on their searches and bombarded with information about more goods and services that they may eventually \\"need\\", positioned as needs rather than as wants. Josiah Wedgwood's pottery, a status symbol of consumerism in the late 18th century These trends accelerated in the 18th century as rising prosperity and social mobility increased the number of people with disposable income for consumption. Important shifts included the marketing of goods for individuals (as opposed to items for the household), and the new status of goods as status symbols, related to changes in fashion and to be desired for aesthetic appeal, as opposed to just their utility. The pottery entrepreneur and inventor, Josiah Wedgwood, noticed the way that aristocratic fashions, themselves subject to periodic changes in direction, slowly filtered down through different classes of society. He pioneered the use of marketing techniques to influence and manipulate the movement of prevailing tastes and preferences to cause the aristocracy to accept his goods; it was only a matter of time before the middle classes also apidly bought up his goods. Other producers of a wide range of other products followed his example, and the spread and importance of consumption fashions became steadily more important. =Mass production= The Industrial Revolution dramatically increased the availability of consumer goods, although it was still primarily focused on the capital goods sector and industrial infrastructure (i.e., mining, steel, oil, transportation networks, communications networks, industrial cities, financial centers, etc.).Ryan in Ritzer 2007, p. 701 The advent of the department store represented a paradigm shift in the experience of shopping. Customers could now buy an astonishing variety of goods, all in one place, and shopping became a popular leisure activity. While previously the norm had been the scarcity of resources, the industrial era created an unprecedented economic situation. For the first time in history products were available in outstanding quantities, at outstandingly low prices, being thus available to virtually everyone in the industrialized West. By the turn of the 20th century the average worker in Western Europe or the United States still spent approximately 80‚Äì90% of their income on food and other necessities. What was needed to propel consumerism, was a system of mass production and consumption, exemplified by Henry Ford, an American car manufacturer. After observing the assembly lines in the meat packing industry, Frederick Winslow Taylor brought his theory of scientific management to the organization of the assembly line in other industries; this unleashed incredible productivity and reduced the costs of commodities produced on assembly lines around the world.Ryan in Ritzer 2007, p. 702 Black Friday shoppers, DC USA Consumerism has long had intentional underpinnings, rather than just developing out of capitalism. As an example, Earnest Elmo Calkins noted to fellow advertising executives in 1932 that \\"consumer engineering must see to it that we use up the kind of goods we now merely use\\", while the domestic theorist Christine Frederick observed in 1929 that \\"the way to break the vicious deadlock of a low standard of living is to spend freely, and even waste creatively\\". The older term and concept of \\"conspicuous consumption\\" originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writings of sociologist and economist, Thorstein Veblen. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following: The term \\"conspicuous consumption\\" spread to describe consumerism in the United States in the 1960s, but was soon linked to debates about media theory, culture jamming, and its corollary productivism. =In the 21st century= McDonald's and KFC restaurants in China Madeline Levine criticized what she saw as a large change in American culture ‚Äì \\"a shift away from values of community, spirituality, and integrity, and toward competition, materialism and disconnection.\\"Levine, Madeline. \\"Challenging the Culture of Affluence\\". Independent School. 67.1 (2007): 28‚Äì36. Businesses have realized that wealthy consumers are the most attractive targets of marketing. The upper class's tastes, lifestyles, and preferences trickle down to become the standard for all consumers. The not-so- wealthy consumers can \\"purchase something new that will speak of their place in the tradition of affluence\\".Miller, Eric. Attracting the Affluent. Naperville, Illinois: Financial Sourcebooks, 1990. A consumer can have the instant gratification of purchasing an expensive item to improve social status. Emulation is also a core component of 21st century consumerism. As a general trend, regular consumers seek to emulate those who are above them in the social hierarchy. The poor strive to imitate the wealthy and the wealthy imitate celebrities and other icons. The celebrity endorsement of products can be seen as evidence of the desire of modern consumers to purchase products partly or solely to emulate people of higher social status. This purchasing behavior may co-exist in the mind of a consumer with an image of oneself as being an individualist. Cultural capital, the intangible social value of goods, is not solely generated by cultural pollution. Subcultures also manipulate the value and prevalence of certain commodities through the process of bricolage. Bricolage is the process by which mainstream products are adopted and transformed by subcultures.Sturken, Marita and Cartwright, Lisa. \\"Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture\\". Oxford UP, 2001, p.78 These items develop a function and meaning that differs from their corporate producer's intent. In many cases, commodities that have undergone bricolage often develop political meanings. For example, Doc Martens, originally marketed as workers boots, gained popularity with the punk movement and AIDs activism groups and became symbols of an individual's place in that social group.Sturken, Marita and Cartwright, Lisa. \\"Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture\\". Oxford UP, 2001, p. 79 When corporate America recognized the growing popularity of Doc Martens they underwent another change in cultural meaning through counter-bricolage. The widespread sale and marketing of Doc Martens brought the boots back into the mainstream. While corporate America reaped the ever-growing profits of the increasingly expensive boot and those modeled after its style, Doc Martens lost their original political association. Mainstream consumers used Doc Martens and similar items to create an \\"individualized\\" sense identity by appropriating statement items from subcultures they admired. When consumerism is considered as a movement to improve rights and powers of buyers in relation to sellers, there are certain traditional rights and powers of sellers and buyers. American Dream has long been associated with consumerism. According to Sierra Club's Dave Tilford, \\"With less than 5 percent of world population, the U.S. uses one-third of the world‚Äôs paper, a quarter of the world‚Äôs oil, 23 percent of the coal, 27 percent of the aluminum, and 19 percent of the copper.\\" China is the world's fastest-growing consumer market. According to biologist Paul R. Ehrlich, \\"If everyone consumed resources at the US level, you will need another four or five Earths.\\"Biologists say half of all species could be extinct by end of the century. The Guardian. 25 February 2017. Criticism=Overview= Buy Nothing Day demonstration in San Francisco, November 2000. Shop Until You Drop by Banksy, in London. Since consumerism began, various individuals and groups have consciously sought an alternative lifestyle. These movements range on a spectrum from moderate \\"simple living\\",See for example: Janet Luhrs's The Simple Living Guide (NY: Broadway Books, 1997); Joe Dominquez, Vicki Robin et al., Your Money or Your Life (NY: Penguin Group USA, 2008) \\"eco-conscious shopping\\",See for example: Alan Durning, How Much is Enough: The Consumer Society and the Future of the Earth (New York: W. W. Norton, 1992) and \\"localvore\\"/\\"buying local\\",See for example: Paul Roberts, The End of Food (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2008); Michael Shuman, The Small- mart Revolution (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2007) to Freeganism on the extreme end. Building on these movements, the discipline of ecological economics addresses the macro-economic, social and ecological implications of a primarily consumer-driven economy. In many critical contexts, consumerism is used to describe the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially those with commercial brand-names and perceived status-symbolism appeal, e.g. a luxury car, designer clothing, or expensive jewelry. Consumerism can take extreme forms ‚Äì such that consumers sacrifice significant time and income not only to purchase but also to actively support a certain firm or brand. As stated by Gary Cross in his book \\"All Consuming Century: Why Consumerism Won in Modern America\\", he states \\"consumerism succeeded where other ideologies failed because it concretely expressed the cardinal political ideals of the century ‚Äì liberty and democracy ‚Äì and with relatively little self-distructive behavior or personal humiliation.\\" He discusses how consumerism won in its forms of expression. However, many people are skeptical of this over-romanticised outlook. Opponents of consumerism argue that many luxuries and unnecessary consumer-products may act as a social mechanism allowing people to identify like-minded individuals through the display of similar products, again utilizing aspects of status-symbolism to judge socioeconomic status and social stratification. Some people believe relationships with a product or brand name are substitutes for healthy human relationships lacking in societies, and along with consumerism, create a cultural hegemony, and are part of a general process of social control in modern society. Critics of consumerism point out that consumerist societies are more prone to damage the environment, contribute to global warming and use resources at a higher rate than other societies.Global Climate Change and Energy CO2 Production‚ÄîAn International Perspective Dr. Jorge Majfud says that \\"Trying to reduce environmental pollution without reducing consumerism is like combatting drug trafficking without reducing the drug addiction.\\" In 1955, economist Victor Lebow stated: Critics of consumerism include Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI,Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks- consumerism/ Pope Francis,\\"Loss of Biodiversity\\". Laudato Si': on Care for Our Common Home: Encyclical Letter, by Pope Francis, Our Sunday Visitor, 2015, pp. 27‚Äì27. German historian Oswald Spengler (1880‚Äì1936), who said: \\"Life in America is exclusively economic in structure and lacks depth\\"Stearns, Peter. Consumerism in World History. Routledge), and French writer Georges Duhamel (1884‚Äì1966), who held American materialism up as \\"a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization\\". Pope Francis also critiques consumerism in his book \\"Laudato Si' On Care For Our Common Home.\\" He critiques the harm consumerism does to the environment and states, \\"The analysis of environmental problems cannot be separated from the analysis of human, family, work-related and urban contexts, nor from how individuals relate to themselves, which leads in turn to how they relate to others and to the environment.\\"https://www.cssr.org.au/justice_matters/dsp- default.cfm?loadref=643 Pope Francis believes obsession with consumerism leads individuals further away from their humanity and obscures the interrelated nature between humans and the environment. Francis Fukuyama blames consumerism for moral compromises. Another critic is James Gustave Speth. He argues that the growth imperative represents the main goal of capitalistic consumerism. In his book The Bridge at the Edge of the World he notes, \\"Basically, the economic system does not work when it comes to protecting environmental resources, and the political system does not work when it comes to correcting the economic system\\". In an opinion segment of New Scientist magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited William Rees of the University of British Columbia and epidemiologist Warren Hern of the University of Colorado at Boulder saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are \\"subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion ... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities.\\" According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America, human society is in a \\"global overshoot\\", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic \\"bio-capacities\\", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries, which have a material surplus due to their lower consumption. Not only that, but McCraken indicates that the ways in which consumer goods and services are bought, created and used should be taken under consideration when studying consumption. Furthermore, some theorists have concerns with the place commodity takes in the definition of one's self. Media theorists Straut Ewen coined the term \\"commodity self\\" to describe an identity built by the goods we consume.Sturken, Marita and Cartwright, Lisa. \\"Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture\\". Oxford UP, 2001, p. 279 For example, people often identify as PC or Mac users, or define themselves as a Coke drinker rather than Pepsi. The ability to choose one product out of an apparent mass of others allows a person to build a sense \\"unique\\" individuality, despite the prevalence of Mac users or the nearly identical tastes of Coke and Pepsi. By owning a product from a certain brand, one's ownership becomes a vehicle of presenting an identity that is associated with the attitude of the brand. The idea of individual choice is exploited by corporations that claim to sell \\"uniqueness\\" and the building blocks of an identity. The invention of the commodity self is a driving force of consumerist societies, preying upon the deep human need to build a sense of self. Not all anti-consumerists oppose consumption in itself, but they argue against increasing the consumption of resources beyond what is environmentally sustainable. Jonathan Porritt writes that consumers are often unaware of the negative environmental impacts of producing many modern goods and services, and that the extensive advertising-industry only serves to reinforce increasing consumption. Likewise, other ecological economists such as Herman Daly and Tim Jackson recognize the inherent conflict between consumer-driven consumption and planet-wide ecological degradation. =Consumerism as cultural ideology= In the 21st century's globalized economy, consumerism has become a noticeable part of the culture. Critics of the phenomenon not only criticized it against what is environmentally sustainable, but also the spread of consumerism in cultural aspects. However, several scholars have written about the intersection of consumer culture and the environment. Discussions of the environmental implications of consumerist ideologies in work by economists Gustave Speth and Naomi Klein, and consumer cultural historian Gary Cross. Leslie Sklair proposes the criticism through the idea of culture-ideology of consumerism in his works. He says that, As of today, people are exposed to mass consumerism and product placement in the media or even in their daily lives. The line between information, entertainment, and promotion of products has been blurred so people are more reformulated into consumerist behaviour.Leslie Sklair, from Chapter 5 of Globalization: Capitalism and Its Alternatives, 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, 2002. Reprinted with permission of Oxford University Press Shopping centers are a representative example of a place where people are explicitly exposed to an environment that welcomes and encourages consumption as some of them are open for 24 hours. Goss says that the shopping center designers \\"strive to present an alternative rationale for the shopping center's existence, manipulate shoppers' behavior through the configuration of space, and consciously design a symbolic landscape that provokes associative moods and dispositions in the shopper\\".Jon Goss(1993), The \\"Magic of the Mall\\": An Analysis of Form, Function, and Meaning in the Contemporary Retail Built Environment, Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 83, No. 1. (Mar. 1993), pp. 18‚Äì47 On the prevalence of consumerism in daily life, Historian Gary Cross says that \\"The endless variation of clothing, travel, and entertainment provided opportunity for practically everyone to find a personal niche, no matter their race, age, gender or class.\\"Cross, Gary S. An All-Consuming Century: Why Commercialism Won in Modern America. Columbia University Press, 2002. pp.233 The success of the consumerist cultural ideology can be witnessed all around the world. People rush to the mall to buy products and end up spending money with their credit cards, thus locking themselves into the financial system of capitalist globalization.

It was written by Doug Neubauer, an Atari employee, and released as a cartridge by Atari in 1979. The game is considered the platform's killer app. It was later ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari ST. The game simulates 3D space combat between the player's ship and an invading fleet of alien \\"Zylon\\" vessels. Star Raiders was distinctive for its graphics, which, in addition to various map and long range scan views, provided forward and aft first-person views, with movement conveyed by a streaming 3D starfield as the player engaged enemy spacecraft. While there had already been target-shooting games using the first person perspective (including 1978's Cosmic Conflict), Star Raiders had considerably higher quality visuals and more complex gameplay. It inspired imitators throughout the 1980s as well as later-generation space combat simulation games including Elite, Wing Commander, and Star Wars: X-Wing. In 2007, Star Raiders was included in a list of the 10 most important video games of all time, as compiled by Stanford University's History of Science and Technology Collections. Gameplay=Galactic Chart and hyperspace= Like the text- based Star Trek games, in Star Raiders the player's ship maneuvers about a two-dimensional grid fighting a fleet of enemy spaceships. In Star Raiders, this part of the game takes the form of a \\"Galactic Chart\\" display dividing the game's large-scale world into a grid of sectors, some of which are empty, while other are occupied by enemy ships or a friendly \\"starbase\\". The Galactic Map is the equivalent of the earlier Star Trek's Long Range Scan. Flying about in the 3D view with the ship's normal engines is sufficient for travel within a sector; travel between sectors is via \\"hyperspace\\", accomplished through an elaborate and noisy \\"hyperwarp\\" sequence with graphics loosely reminiscent of the Star Wars and Star Trek films in which the stars seemed to stretch to radial lines. On the higher difficulty levels, hyperwarp has a skill element; the player has to keep a wandering cross hair roughly centered during the sequence in order to arrive precisely at the desired destination. =Combat, damage and resources= Two Zylon fighters attack. Below the crosshair is a Patrol ship. A Fighter is in the upper right. To the Star Trek formula, the game added real-time 3D battles as a space combat simulator. In the main first-person display, the player can look out of the ship and shoot \\"photons\\" at Zylon ships, which come in three different varieties reminiscent of ships from Star Wars, Star Trek, and Battlestar Galactica (whose villains were the similarly titled Cylons). A small targeting display in the lower right corner gives a general indication of a distant enemy or starbase's position relative to the player's ship, and also indicates when weapons are locked on the enemy, at which point the player's weapons will fire two torpedoes simultaneously. There is also a \\"long-range scan\\" screen showing the surrounding region in a third-person overhead view centered on your ship, operating like a long-range radar display. Enemy ships come in three types. The standard Fighters resemble the TIE fighter. The Patrol ships, which do not fire until fired upon, loosely resemble the front-on view of a Cylon Raider or Klingon Battlecruiser. The most powerful Zylon ship, the Basestar, has a pulsating orange glow and resembles a Cylon Basestar. It also has shields, which protect it from incoming fire, thus requiring the player to either hit it multiple times in rapid succession at close range or get it into a Target Lock, which results in two torpedoes being fired simultaneously and tracking the target until impact. The game has four difficulty levels; on all but the lowest \\"Novice\\" level players must steer the ship into hyperspace and collisions with random meteoroids and enemy fire can cause damage to the player's ship. Such damage includes malfunctioning or nonfunctional shields, engines, weapons or information displays. Any collision when shields are down destroys the ship and ends the game. Running out of energy likewise ends the game. The player has to manage finite energy reserves as well as damage to the ship; it can be repaired and restocked by rendezvous with a friendly starbase. The enemy can also destroy a starbase if allowed to surround its Galactic Chart sector for too long, so the starbases have to be defended. All this lends Star Raiders a degree of complexity and a sense of player immersion that was rare in action games of the era. =Scoring= In contrast to many games of the era, the player can actually win the game by destroying all enemy ships in the galaxy. However, there is no running score display; only upon winning, dying or quitting the game will the player receive a \\"rating\\", which is a quasi- military rank accompanied by a numerical class with particularly bad play earning a rank of \\"Garbage Scow Captain\\" or \\"Galactic Cook\\". The rating depends on a formula involving the game play level, energy and time used, star bases destroyed (both by player or the enemy), the number of enemies destroyed, and whether the player succeeded in destroying all enemies, was destroyed, or aborted (quit or ran out of energy) the mission. Some possible ratings reach from Rookie to Star Commander. Development Wanting to make an action-oriented Star Trek-type game, Doug Neubauer designed Star Raiders in about eight to ten months while working for Atari. He left the company while the game was still a prototype to return home to Oregon and join Hewlett- Packard, and reported that it took him six months to reach the highest player- level during development. Star Raiders was unusual at the time for Atari, as it made relatively few game cartridges for its computers, with most being adaptations of Atari 2600 titles. =Technical details= Atari 8-bit computer cartridge; early releases had a typo on the label: Star Raider. The main simulation continues running even when the user is interacting with other displays. For instance, one might be attacked while examining the Galactic Map. This was unusual for the time, if not unique. The primary playfield/star field is drawn in the graphics mode that provides 160√ó96 bitmapped pixels utilizing four color registers at a time out of a palette of 128 colors provided by the CTIA chip in the early Atari computers. This is called ANTIC mode D, but accessed in Atari BASIC by use of the \\"GRAPHICS 7\\" command. The Atari's use of an indirect palette means that color changes associated with the presence or absence of energy shields, emergency alarms, and the screen flash representing destruction of the ship can be accomplished by simply changing the palette values in memory registers. Enemy ships, shots, and most other moving objects use Atari's variant of hardware sprites, known as player- missile graphics, which have their own color registers independent of the current screen graphics mode. The radar display in the lower right of screen is drawn using the background graphics, and updated less frequently than the sprites. The debris particles emitted when an enemy ship is destroyed are calculated as 3D points. Since the 6502 processor in the Atari 8-bit family does not have a native multiply or divide command, the game slows down considerably when several of these particles are active. The Atari 8-bit family allows different graphics modes and color palettes to be used in different horizontal bands on the screen, by using a simple display list and a type of horizontal blank interrupt. While other games make more extensive use of these techniques, Star Raiders uses them in a relatively simple fashion to combine text displays and graphics; the cockpit display uses a custom character set to display futuristic-looking characters and symbols reminiscent of MICR. Star Raiders' sounds of engines, shots, explosions, alarms, etc. are algorithmically synthesized directly using the POKEY sound chip's capabilities. Neubauer was involved in the design of POKEY. The entire game, code and data, fits into 8K (8192 bytes) of ROM, and requires only 8K of RAM for its working data and display visuals; thus it can run on any Atari 8-bit computer. Ports The Atari 2600 version shipped with the Video Touch Pad controller. Versions of Star Raiders were created for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari ST series of computers. The Atari 5200 version was done by programmer Joe Copson and released in autumn 1982. This version is nearly identical to the computer version, but takes advantage of the 5200's analog joystick by allowing for variable speed turning, and puts all the game functions in the player's hand via the controller's 12-button keypad. Other changes are graphical improvements to the Sector Scan mode by displaying small images of enemy ships and objects instead of pinpoints, alterations to some of the text responses to be more specific to the game-ending action, and automatically switching to Forward View when Hyperspace is engaged. The Atari 2600 version was programmed by Carla Meninsky and released in 1982. It suffers somewhat due to the 2600's weaker graphics and sound capabilities. It shipped with a special keypad controller, the Video Touch Pad, to take the place of the computer keyboard. Although the controller was designed to accept overlays for compatibility with multiple games, Star Raiders was the only game to utilize it. In this version the Zylons are renamed \\"Krylons\\". The Atari ST version was designed and programmed by Robert Zdybel with graphics and animation by Jerome Domurat and released by Atari Corporation in 1986. It is a very different game in many ways, with more enemy ship types, different weapons, slower action, and a map featuring a triangular grid instead of a square one, which makes it much easier for the Zylon ships to surround starbases. Reception While criticizing the violent gameplay, after seeing a demonstration Ted Nelson wrote, \\"The Atari machine is the most extraordinary computer graphics box ever made, and Star Raiders is its virtuoso demonstration game\\". Compute! in 1980 wrote that Star Raiders is \\"incredibly exciting to play and just about as much fun to watch!\\" It praised the game's use of color and sound to alert the player, and warned that \\"THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE!\\". \\"This game is absolutely guaranteed to put calluses on your trigger-finger\\", InfoWorld stated. The magazine reported that Star Raiders complexity encouraged cooperative gameplay, and that \\"over twenty hours of grueling tests by a battery of ingenious children\\" had proven that it was free of bugs. BYTE wrote in 1981 that it was the Atari's killer app: \\"What can you say about a game that takes your breath away? There are not enough superlatives to describe Star Raiders. Just as the VisiCalc software ... has enticed many people into buying Apple II computers, I'm sure that the Star Raiders cartridge ... has sold its share of Atari 400 and 800 computers\\". It concluded, \\"To all software vendors, this is the game you have to surpass to get our attention\\". Electronic Games agreed, reporting that it \\"is the game that, in the opinion of many, sells a lot of 400 computers systems\\", and \\"has established the standards prospective software marketed will be trying to surpass over the next year or so\\". Softline in 1982 called Star Raiders \\"quite a game ... stands repeat play well and remains quite difficult\\". In 1983 the magazine's readers named it \\"The Most Popular Atari Program Ever\\", with 65% more weighted votes than second-place Jawbreaker, and in 1984 they named the game the most popular Atari program of all time. The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave it an overall A rating, praising the realistic graphics and sound. The book concluded that \\"the game is simply great\\" and that despite imitations, \\"Star Raiders remains the classic\\". Antic in 1986 stated that \\"it was the first program that showed all of the Atari computer's audio and visual capabilities. It was just a game, yes, but it revolutionized the idea of what a personal computer could be made to do.\\" Jerry Pournelle of BYTE named the Atari ST version his game of the month for August 1986, describing it as \\"like the old 8-bit Star Raiders had died and gone to heaven. The action is fast, the graphics are gorgeous, and I've spent entirely too much time with it\\". On March 12, 2007, The New York Times reported that Star Raiders was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon. The Library of Congress took up a video game preservation proposal and began with the games from this list, including Star Raiders. Legacy=Sequels= Star Raiders II (1986)  The Star Raiders II that was released in 1986 by Atari Corp. had no relationship to the original other than the name, and was, in fact, merely a rebranded game originally developed as a licensed tie-in for the movie The Last Starfighter.  Unreleased Star Raiders II  In 2015, Kevin Savetz, host of the ANTIC Podcast, was contacted by former Atari, Inc. programmer Aric Wilmunder. Wilmunder mentioned he had been part of a team working on 8-bit computer games and decided to make a sequel to Star Raiders. This version of Star Raiders II is faithful to the original gameplay, but designed to make use of new 32 kB cartridges. The torpedoes were replaced with a laser-like weapon that can be aimed semi-independently of the ship's motion. The enemies are now 3D wireframe ships instead of 2D sprites. The gridded galactic map was replaced with a free-form version. In this rendition, the player's home planet is in the upper left of the map, and the enemy ships are ultimately attempting to attack it. A number of planets can also be attacked on the surface in a view based on the Star Wars arcade game, which was being developed down the hall from Wilmunder's office. The main part of the game was complete by early 1984, but Atari was in disarray and undergoing a continual downsizing. Eventually, he was laid off, but kept the source code when he left. He later unsuccessfully tried to interest the new Atari Corporation in the project. The game, in an untuned but functionally complete and playable state, was added to the Internet Archive along with basic documentation and Wilmunder's telling of the history of the game. 2011 remake A re-imagining of Star Raiders, developed by Incinerator Studios and published by Atari SA, was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows on May 11, 2011 =Clones and influenced games= Many games heavily inspired by Star Raiders appeared, such as Starmaster (Atari 2600), Space Spartans (Intellivision), and Star Luster (Famicom‚ÄìJapan only). Neubauer's own Solaris, for the Atari 2600, is both similar and in some ways more sophisticated than his earlier game, despite the difference in technology between the two systems. Star Raiders inspired later space combat games like Elite, the Wing Commander series and BattleSphere. Star Rangers, an homage to Star Raiders, was released in 2010 for the iPhone. It was written by former 8-bit game programmer Tom Hudson, who was at one time a technical editor for Atari hobbyist magazine ANALOG Computing. As of October 2014, possibly earlier, Star Rangers is no longer in the iOS App Store. =In popular culture= In 1983 DC Comics published a graphic novel inspired by the game; it was the first title of the DC Graphic Novel series. It was written by Elliot S! Maggin and illustrated by Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez. Early production copies of the Atari 2600 version of the game were accompanied by an Atari Force mini-comic (published by DC Comics). This particular issue was #3 in the series, preceded by mini-comics accompanying the Defender and Berserk games. Two final mini-comics followed with the games Phoenix and Galaxian. = Source code = A scan of the original assembly language source code became available in October 2015 via the Internet Archive.AtariStarRaidersSourceCode (October 16, 2015) It was used to create a text-file version in GitHub.Star Raiders (Version 25.1/Stardate \\"26-JUL-79\\") on github.com/XioNYC ReferencesExternal links Interview with Doug Neubauer, October 1986 issue of ANALOG Computing Category:1979 video games Category:Atari 2600 games Category:Atari 5200 games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Atari ST games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Space combat simulators Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code ","title":"Star Raiders"},{"id":"170533","text":"tcpdump is a data-network packet analyzer computer program that runs under a command line interface. It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached. Distributed under the BSD license, tcpdump is free software. Tcpdump works on most Unix-like operating systems: Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenWrt, macOS, HP-UX 11i, and AIX. In those systems, tcpdump uses the libpcap library to capture packets. The port of tcpdump for Windows is called WinDump; it uses WinPcap, the Windows version of libpcap. History tcpdump was originally written in 1988 by Van Jacobson, Sally Floyd, Vern Paxson and Steven McCanne who were, at the time, working in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Network Research Group. By the late 1990s there were numerous versions of tcpdump distributed as part of various operating systems, and numerous patches that were not well coordinated. Michael Richardson (mcr) and Bill Fenner created www.tcpdump.org in 1999. Common uses tcpdump prints the contents of network packets. It can read packets from a network interface card or from a previously created saved packet file. tcpdump can write packets to standard output or a file. It is also possible to use tcpdump for the specific purpose of intercepting and displaying the communications of another user or computer. A user with the necessary privileges on a system acting as a router or gateway through which unencrypted traffic such as Telnet or HTTP passes can use tcpdump to view login IDs, passwords, the URLs and content of websites being viewed, or any other unencrypted information. The user may optionally apply a BPF-based filter to limit the number of packets seen by tcpdump; this renders the output more usable on networks with a high volume of traffic.

However, the -Z option may be used to drop privileges to a specific unprivileged user after capturing has been set up. In other Unix-like operating systems, the packet capturing mechanism can be configured to allow non-privileged users to use it; if that is done, superuser privileges are not required.

Compatibility The Supercharger is compatible with Atari 2600, Atari 2600 Jr., and the Sears Video Arcade consoles. Due to the shape of the Supercharger, it does not normally fit into the ColecoVision's Expansion Module #1, which is an adapter that allows the ColecoVision to play Atari 2600 games. However, if the cover of the expansion module is removed or an extender is used, the Supercharger will work. Extenders were sent to customers who called Starpath about such issues. The Supercharger does not work on many Atari 7800 systems (which is typically backward compatible with the Atari 2600), although it does with some early models of the system. After Atari installed a circuit to fix a compatibility issue with the 2600 version of Dark Chambers, it subsequently caused incompatibility with the Supercharger and some other games that use the FE bank switching method.

He was granted lands in England by William the Conqueror soon after he and his followers had invaded and controlled Saxon England.  Norman victor  The early Norman church at Bramber was at the centre of a dispute between William de Braose and F√©camp Abbey. Braose had been given extensive lands in Sussex by 1073. He became feudal baron of the Rape of BramberThe Origins of Some Anglo-Norman Families, Lewis Christopher Loyd, David C. Douglas, The Harleian Society, Leeds, Reprinted by Genealogical Publishing Company, 1975, , where he built Bramber Castle. Braose was also awarded lands around Wareham and Corfe in Dorset, two manors in Surrey, Southcote in Berkshire and Downton in Wiltshire and became one of the most powerful of the new feudal barons of the early Norman era. He continued to bear arms alongside King William in campaigns in England, Normandy and Maine in France. He was a pious man and made considerable grants to the Abbey of Saint Florent, in Saumur, and endowed the foundation of priories at Sele near Bramber and at Briouze. He was soon occupying a new Norman castle at Bramber, guarding the strategically important harbour at Steyning, and began a vigorous boundary dispute and power struggle with the monks of F√©camp Abbey in Normandy, to whom William the Conqueror had granted Steyning, brought to a head by the Domesday Book, completed in 1086.  Land disputes Braose built a bridge at Bramber and demanded tolls from ships travelling further along the river to the busy port at Steyning. The monks challenged this, and they also disputed Braose's right to bury people in the churchyard of his new church of Saint Nicholas at Bramber, demanding the burial fees for themselves, despite the church's having been built to serve the castle and not the town. The monks then produced forged documents to defend their position and were unhappy with the failure of their claim on Hastings, which was very similar. They claimed the same freedoms and land tenure in Hastings as King Edward had given them at Steyning. On a technicality, King William was bound to uphold all rights and freedoms held by the Abbey before King Edward's death, but the monks had already been expelled ten years before that. William wanted to hold Hastings for himself for strategic reasons, and he ignored the problem until 1085, when he confirmed the Abbey's claims to Steyning but compensated it for its claims at Hastings with land in the manor of Bury, near Pulborough in Sussex. In 1086 King William called his sons, barons, and bishops to court (the last time an English king presided personally, with his full court, to decide a matter of law) to settle the Steyning disputes, which took a full day. The result was that the Abbey won over William de Braose, forcing him to curtail his bridge tolls, to give up various encroachments onto the Abbey's lands, including a farmed rabbit warren, a park, 18 burgage tenements, a causeway, and a channel used to fill his moat. Braose also had to organise a mass exhumation of all Bramber's dead, the bodies being transferred to the Abbey's churchyard of Saint Cuthman's in Steyning. Progeny William de Braose was succeeded as Lord of Bramber by his son, Philip de Braose, and started an important Anglo- Norman dynasty (see House of Braose). Death William de Braose was present in 1093 at the consecration of a church in Briouze, his manor of origin whence originates his family name, thus he was still alive in that year. However, his son Philip was issuing charters as Lord of Bramber in 1096, indicating that William de Braose died sometime between 1093 and 1096.

The original Wizardry was a significant influence on early console role- playing games such as Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. Originally made for the Apple II, the games were later ported to other platforms. The last game in the original series by Sir-Tech was Wizardry 8, released in 2001. There have since been various spin-off titles released only in Japan. Development Wizardry began as a simple dungeon crawl by Andrew C. Greenberg and Robert Woodhead. It was written when they were students at Cornell University and published by Sir-Tech. The game was influenced by earlier games from the PLATO system, most notably Oubliette. The earliest installments of Wizardry were very successful, as they were the first graphically-rich incarnations of Dungeons & Dragons- type gameplay for home computers. The release of the first version coincided with the height of Dungeons & Dragons' popularity in North America. The first five games in the series were written in Apple Pascal, an implementation of UCSD Pascal. They were ported to many different platforms by writing UCSD Pascal implementations for the target machines (Mac II cross-development). David W. Bradley took over the series after the fourth installment, adding a new level of plot and complexity. In 1998, the rights were transferred to 1259190 Ontario Inc., and in 2006 to Aeria IPM. In 2008, Aeria IPM merged with Gamepot, the developer of Wizardry Online. Datamost released WizPlus, a menu driven utility program designed to modify the characters and the playing environment of Wizardry; Bob Reams reviewed the utility for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"WizPlus should be used with great caution or the spirit of adventuring will be diluted and, more importantly, you will not be able to continue with this exciting series.\\" Games=Main series= The original Wizardry series is composed of eight different titles. All of the titles were first released in North America, and then ported to Japanese computers. Some of the titles were also officially released in Europe. The first three games are a trilogy, with similar settings, plots, and gameplay mechanics. A second trilogy is formed by installments 6 through 8 ‚Äì Bane of the Cosmic Forge, Crusaders of the Dark Savant and Wizardry 8 ‚Äì with settings and gameplay mechanics that differed greatly from the first trilogy. The fourth game, The Return of Werdna, was a significant departure from the rest of the series. In it, the player controls Werdna (\\"Andrew,\\" one of the game's developers, spelled backwards), the evil wizard slain in the first game, and summons groups of monsters to aid him as he fights his way through the prison in which he had been held captive. Rather than monsters, the player faced typical adventuring parties, some of which were pulled from actual user disks sent to Sir-Tech for recovery. Further, the player had only a limited number of keystrokes to use to complete the game. In Japan, the Wizardry series was translated by ASCII Entertainment, and became very influential during the 1980s, even as its popularity at home declined. When first introduced, the games suffered from the culture barrier compounded by low-quality translation. This meant that the game was taken seriously by players who overlooked the in- game jokes and parodies. For example, Blade Cusinart was introduced in early games as \\"a legendary sword made by the famous blacksmith, Cusinart \\" but its meaning was misinterpreted because Cuisinart food processors were virtually unknown in Japan. However, this misconception appealed to early computer gamers who were looking for something different and made the Wizardry series popular. Conversely, the fourth game, The Return of Werdna, was poorly received, as, lacking the knowledge of subcultures necessary to solving the game, Japanese players had no chance of figuring out some puzzles. The eight main titles in the series are: =Spin-offs= In 1996, the series received the first (and, so far, only) spin-off developed in North America, titled Wizardry Nemesis. It is played as a solo adventure: one character only, with no supporting party or monsters. All players use the same character, without the ability to choose class or attributes. In addition, the game contains only 16 spells, compared to 50 in the first four adventures, and more in the subsequent ones. It is also the first Wizardry title where the player saw enemies in advance and thus could try to avoid them. The popularity of Wizardry in Japan inspired several original sequels, spinoffs, and ports, with the series long outliving the American original. As of 2017, thirty-nine different spin-offs were released in Japan, with four of them also making their way to North America: Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land, Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls, Wizardry Online and Wizrogue: Labyrinth of Wizardry. The latest is also the last original game produced in the series, released in Japan in 2014, and officially released in English worldwide in 2017. Reception The original Wizardry game was a success, selling 24,000 copies by June 1982, just nine months after its release according to Softalk‚Äòs sales surveys. In the June 1983 issue of Electronic Games, Wizardry was described as \\"without a doubt, the most popular fantasy adventure game for the Apple II at the present time\\". While noting limitations such as the inability to divide the party, or the emphasis on combat over role-playing, the magazine stated that \\"no other game comes closer to providing the type of contest favored by most players of non-electronic role-playing games... one outstanding programming achievement, and an absolute 'must buy' for those fantasy gamers who own an Apple\\". By 1987, the series had sold over 1.5 million copies and by 1994, over 4.6 million copies had been sold. Spin-offs originally released in Japan received generally positive reviews in North America. Gamespot reviewed Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land in 2002 and awarded it a score of 8.5 out of 10.Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land Review - GameSpot In 2011, Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls was also reviewed by Gamespot and received a score of 7.5 out of 10.Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls Review - GameSpot In Japan, readers of Famitsu magazine considered the Famicom port of the original Wizardry I to be one of the 100 best games of all time. The series was ranked as the 60th top game (collectively) by Next Generation in 1996. They cited the \\"huge dungeons with elaborate quests and tons of differing enemies.\\"Next Generation 21 (September 1996), pp. 48, 51. Fans of the series included Robin Williams, Harry Anderson, and the Crown Prince of Bahrain; the latter even called Sir-Tech on the phone. Legacy=Innovation in gameplay= Together with the Ultima series, Wizardry established the conventions of role-playing video games. The command-driven battle system with a still image of the monster being fought would be emulated in later games, such as The Bard's Tale, Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy. The party-based combat in Wizardry also inspired Richard Garriott to include a similar party-based system in Ultima III: Exodus. Other user interface elements were influential in Japanese role- playing games. The later Wizardry games implemented multiple endings, some of which were only accessible to people who imported characters from previous games. Wizardry features what would later be called prestige classes. Aside from the traditional character classes, such as fighter, players could take more advanced ones that combined the abilities of multiple classes if they had the right attributes and alignment. In the early Wizardry games, some classes were inaccessible during character creation due to the high requirements; this meant the player needed to first gain levels and then change their class. Wizardry VI allowed starting with any class if the player invested enough time during the random character attribute generation. =Influence on subsequent games= Wizardry inspired many clones and served as a template for role- playing video games. Some notable series that trace their look and feel to Wizardry include 1985's The Bard's Tale and the Might and Magic series. The specific Wizardry formula, that of a turn based RPG taking place primarily in a dungeon via first person exploration, is referred to as a dungeon crawl. Wizardry is the major inspiration to the Nintendo DS title The Dark Spire. While the game follows its own story and maps, much of the game uses the same game play mechanics, even going so far as including a \\"classic\\" mode that removes all of the game's graphics, replacing them with a wireframe environment, 8-bit-style sprites for monsters and characters, and chiptune music. The game's publisher, Atlus, also published another Wizardry spin-off, Wizardry: Tale of the Forsaken Land. While designing the popular Japanese role-playing game Dragon Quest, Yuji Horii drew inspiration from the Wizardry series, 1986's Mugen no Shinzou (Heart of Phantasm), and the Ultima series of games. Horii's obsession with Wizardry was manifested as an easter egg in one of his earlier games, The Portopia Serial Murder Case in 1983. In a dungeon- crawling portion of that adventure game, a note on the wall reads \\"MONSTER SURPRISED YOU.\\" The English fan translation added a sidenote explaining \\"This is Yuji Horii wishing he could have made this game an RPG like Wizardry!\\" Wizardry's legacy continued in Japan after the parent company ended, with titles such as Wizardry Gaiden, Wizardry Empire, and Wizardry XTH, being developed after the original games were released and generally keeping the same tropes, themes, and mechanics. Notably Wizardry XTH: Academy of Frontier swapped the original's Gothic themes for a modern day military school setting, adding item crafting and party member compatibility to the Wizardry formula. Much like the original Wizardry, XTH spawned a direct storyline sequel, Wizardry XTH: Unlimited Students. The second XTH game was used as the basis for and shared code with Class of Heroes, which swapped the modern science fiction elements for a combination of High School, High Fantasy, and Anime aesthetics. Class of Heroes would go on to spawn several sequels and spinoffs itself. Following the shutdown of Michaelsoft, the director of Wizardry XTH, Motoya Ataka took a group of programmers he called \\"Team Muramasa\\" that had worked on Empire and XTH and went on to found Experience Inc., creating a series of PC games with Wizardry XTH's mechanics called Generation Xth. These would later be ported to the PlayStation Vita, their ports localized as Operation Abyss and Operation Babel. Experience would go on to create several other DRPGs using Wizardry's mechanics as a starting point, including Students of the Round, Stranger of Sword City, and Demon Gaze. Starfish, the development team behind Wizardry Empire, would later go on to create Elminage, a series of DRPGs that retained the original Gothic aesthetic (and difficulty) of the western Wizardry games. Elminage was notable for using the expanded \\"kemonojin\\" races from Wizardry Asterisk, also by Starfish, as well as the summoner class from Wizardry: Summoner‚Äîthese included \\"Were-Beast,\\" \\"Dragonnewt,\\" \\"Fairy,\\" and \\"Devilkin\\" as well as expanded classes such as \\"Brawler\\" (a hand to hand melee specialist), \\"Alchemist\\" (a combination crafting class and spellcaster), and \\"Summoner\\" (a spellcasting class that can tame and summon monsters from the dungeon). These \\"expanded\\" Japanese Wizardry mechanics would be reused in future Elminage games as well as notably Class of Heroes. =Wizardry Renaissance= In 2009 several Japanese publishers and Development teams started a \\"Brand Revitalization plan,\\" which they called the \\"Wizardry Renaissance\\". After Sir-Tech, the original Wizardry creator in the US, was dissolved, several semi-official games were created in Japan of varying quality and thematic elements. \\"Wizardry Renaissance\\" aimed to \\"rebuild\\" the brand by agreeing to a certain \\"worldview\\" and quality standards to these semi-official Wizardry games. Wizardry Renaissance titles include: * Wizardry Online, a PC MMORPG, shut down in 2016. * Wizardry: Torawareshi Tamashii no Meiky≈´, a PlayStation 3, iOS, Vita, and PC RPG (localized in the West as Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls) * Wizardry: Seimei no Kusabi, a Nintendo DS title * Wizardry: B≈çkyaku no Isan, a Nintendo DS title, which re- used elements from Seimei no Kusabi * Wizardry Online Mobile, a mobile phone MMORPG, shut down in 2011. * Wizardry: Torawareshi B≈çrei no Machi, a PlayStation 3 RPG * T≈çky≈ç Meiky≈´ - Wizardry 0 -, a Social-Networking Card- Battle RPG using the Mobage service on smartphones, shut down sometime in 2012 * Wizardry: Senran no Mat≈ç, a Social-Networking RPG for smartphones, shut down in 2015 * Wizardry Schema, an Incremental game RPG for smartphones, shut down in 2017 * Wizrogue: Labyrinth of Wizardry, an isometric roguelike RPG with Gacha game elements, originally shut down in 2015, it was re-launched in 2017 with the Gacha game elements removed. These titles were released from late 2009 to 2016; the latest activity is the port of Wizardry: Labyrinth of Lost Souls to the PC in January 2020. =Related media= The popularity of Wizardry in Japan also inspired various light novels, manga comics, Japanese pen-and-paper role-playing games, and an original video animation. A popular light novel series titled Sword Art Online also had a character who stated that his inspiration came from this game. Most have been released only in Japan.

The series is set during the 22nd and 23rd centuries, and its atompunk retrofuturistic setting and art work are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s United States, with its combination of hope for the promises of technology and the lurking fear of nuclear annihilation. A forerunner for Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 game developed by Interplay Productions to which the series is regarded as a spiritual successor. The series' first title, Fallout, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997, and its sequel, Fallout 2, the following year. With the tactical role-playing game Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, development was handed to Micro Fort√© and 14 Degrees East. In 2004, Interplay closed Black Isle Studios, and continued to produce Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, an action game with role-playing elements for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, without Black Isle Studios. Fallout 3, the third entry in the main series, was released by Bethesda Softworks, and was followed by Fallout: New Vegas, developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Fallout 4 was released in 2015, and Fallout 76 released on November 14, 2018. Bethesda Softworks owns the rights to the Fallout intellectual property. After acquiring it, Bethesda licensed the rights to make a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) version of Fallout to Interplay. The MMORPG got as far as beta stage under Interplay, but a lengthy legal dispute between Bethesda Softworks and Interplay halted the development of the game and led to its eventual cancellation, as Bethesda claimed in court that Interplay had not met the terms and conditions of the licensing contract. The case was decided in favor of Bethesda.  Origins  The ideas of the Fallout began with Interplay Productions' Wasteland, released in 1988. At that time, Interplay was not a publisher and used Electronic Arts for distribution of the game. According to Interplay's founder, Brian Fargo, they wanted to explore a post- apocalyptic setting and produced Wasteland for that. Sometime after release, Interplay decided to shift focus and become a publisher while still developing games. Fargo wanted to continue to use the Wasteland intellectual property, but could not negotiate the rights back from Electronic Arts. Still wanting to do something in a post-apocalyptic setting, Fargo and his team decided to make a new setting and game, determining what aspects of Wasteland were positives, and wrote and developed a new game around it, ending up with the first Fallout games, released nearly ten years after Wasteland.  Games = Main series = Fallout (1997)  Released in October 1997, Fallout takes place in a post-apocalyptic Southern California, beginning in the year 2161. The protagonist, referred to as the Vault Dweller, is tasked with recovering a water chip in the Wasteland to replace the broken one in their underground shelter home, Vault 13. Afterwards, the Vault Dweller must thwart the plans of a group of mutants, led by a grotesque entity named the Master. Fallout was originally intended to run under the GURPS role-playing game system. However, a disagreement with the creator of GURPS, Steve Jackson, over the game's violent content required Black Isle Studios to develop the new SPECIAL system. Fallouts atmosphere and artwork are reminiscent of post-World War II United States and the fear that the country was headed for nuclear war.  Fallout 2 (1998)  Fallout 2 was released in October 1998, with several improvements over the first game, including an improved engine, the ability to set attitudes of non-player characters (NPC) party members and the ability to push people who are blocking doors. Additional features included several changes, including significantly more pop culture jokes and parodies, such as multiple Monty Python and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy-referencing special random encounters, and self-parodying dialogue that broke the fourth wall to mention game mechanics. Fallout 2 takes place eighty years after Fallout, and centers around a descendant of the Vault Dweller, the protagonist of Fallout. The player assumes the role of the Chosen One as they try to save their village, Arroyo, from famine and droughts. After saving the village, the Chosen One must fight the Enclave, the remnants of the pre-war United States government.  Fallout 3 (2008)  Metro Center station in Washington, D.C. Fallout 3 was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and released on October 28, 2008. The story picks up thirty years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game's world. The player-character is a Vault dweller in Vault 101 who is forced to flee when the Overseer tries to arrest them in response to their father leaving the Vault. Once out, the player is dubbed the Lone Wanderer and ventures into the Wasteland in and around Washington, D.C., known as the Capital Wasteland, to find their father. It differs from previous games in the series by utilizing 3D graphics, a free-roam gaming world, and real-time combat, in contrast to previous games' 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat. It was developed for the PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 using the Gamebryo engine. It received highly positive reviews, garnering 94/100, 92/100, and 93/100 averages scores on Metacritic for the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, respectively. It won IGN's 2008 Overall Game of the Year Award, Xbox 360 Game of the Year, Best RPG, and Best Use of Sound, as well as E3's Best of the Show and Best Role Playing Game.  Fallout 4 (2015)  Fallout 4, developed by Bethesda Game Studios, was released on November 10, 2015. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and takes place in Boston, Massachusetts, of the in-game New England Commonwealth and features voiced protagonists. The Xbox One version has been confirmed to have mods . Bethesda also confirmed mods for PlayStation 4, after lengthy negotiations with Sony. A virtual reality version of the game was released on December 11, 2017. Fallout 4 takes place in the year 2287, ten years after the events of Fallout 3. Fallout 4s story begins on the day the bombs dropped: October 23, 2077. The player's character (voiced by either Brian T. Delaney or Courtenay Taylor), dubbed as the Sole Survivor, takes shelter in Vault 111, emerging 210 years later, after being subjected to suspended animation. The Sole Survivor goes on a search for their son who was taken away in the Vault. = Spin-off games = Fallout: New Vegas (2010)  New Vegas exposition at E3 2010 Fallout: New Vegas was developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released on October 19, 2010. The development team included developers who previously worked on Fallout and Fallout 2. Fallout: New Vegas is not a direct sequel to Fallout 3. Events follow four years after Fallout 3 and offer a similar experience, but no characters from that game appear. The player assumes the role of a courier in the post-apocalyptic world of the Mojave Wasteland. As the game begins, the Courier is shot in the head and left for dead shortly before being found and brought to a doctor in the nearby town of Goodsprings, marking the start of the game and the Courier's search for their would-be murderer. The city of New Vegas is a post-apocalyptic interpretation of Las Vegas. Fallout 76 (2018)  \\"Our Future Begins\\" promotion at gamescom 2018 Fallout 76 is the first online multiplayer game in the franchise, with a choice to play solo if the player wishes. It is set in West Virginia, with a majority of monsters and enemies based on regional folklore. When the game was released, there were no human non-player characters in the game. Some robot NPCs do exist, but the player does not have full dialogue options with these characters. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 14, 2018. = Other games = These games were considered non-canon when Bethesda Softworks acquired the license. However, the canonicity status of Fallout Tactics is complex, despite the original Bethesda statement, multiple Bethesda-era games refer to its events. Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel (2001)  Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel is the first Fallout game not to require the player to fight in a turn-based mode, and the first to allow the player to customize the skills, perks, and combat actions of the rest of the party. Fallout Tactics focuses on tactical combat rather than role-playing; the new combat system included different modes, stances, and modifiers, but the player had no dialogue options. Most of the criticisms of the game came from its incompatibility with the story of the original two games, not from its gameplay. Fallout Tactics includes a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against squads of other characters controlled by other players. Unlike the previous two games, which are based in California, Fallout Tactics takes place in the Midwestern United States. The game was released in early 2001 to generally favorable reviews. Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel (2004)  Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel became the first Fallout game for consoles when it was released in 2004. It follows an initiate in the Brotherhood of Steel who is given a suicidal quest to find several lost Brotherhood Paladins. Brotherhood of Steel is an action role- playing game, representing a significant break from previous incarnations of the Fallout series in both gameplay and aesthetics. The game does not feature non-player characters that accompany the player in combat and uses heavy metal music, including Slipknot, Devin Townsend, and Killswitch Engage, which stands in contrast to the music of the earlier Fallout games, performed by The Ink Spots and Louis Armstrong. It was the last Fallout game developed by Interplay.  Fallout Shelter (2015)  Fallout Shelter is a simulation game for Microsoft Windows, iOS, Android, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. The player acts as the Overseer, building and managing their Vault and its dwellers, sending them into the Wasteland on scouting missions and defending the Vault from attacks. Unlike the main entries in the franchise, this game has no ending and mostly revolves around attempting to keep the people who live in the vault, an intricate fallout shelter, alive. The game uses microtransactions, a form of in game purchases, that take the form of nuka-cola quantum, the game's \\"premium\\" currency, lunch boxes, an item that would give a random mixture of in-game items, pet carriers, something that would contain a pet, which can boost a single dweller's stats, and \\"mister handys\\", a robot who could harvest the games materials or be assigned to outside the vault to harvest bottle caps, the games currency. Fallout Shelter was released for iOS on June 14, 2015, Android on August 13, 2015, and for PC on July 15, 2016. On February 7, 2017, Bethesda launched Fallout Shelter on Xbox One. On June 10, 2018, Bethesda announced and launched Fallout Shelter on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.  Fallout Pinball (2016)  In late 2016, Zen Studios developed a virtual pinball game based on the Fallout universe as part of the Bethesda Pinball collection, which became available as part of Zen Pinball 2, Pinball FX 2 and Pinball FX 3, as well as a separate free-to-play app for iOS and Android mobile devices. The pinball adaptation is based on Fallout 4, while containing elements from previous installments as well. = Canceled games = Fallout Extreme  Fallout Extreme was in development for several months in 2000 but was canceled before leaving the concept stage. It was intended to be a squad-based, first and third-person tactical shooter to be released on Xbox and built on Unreal Engine.  Fallout Tactics 2  Fallout Tactics 2 was proposed as a sequel to Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel, although it was originally conceived as a sequel to Wasteland, the video game that inspired the Fallout series. It was developed by Micro Fort√©, but the production was canceled in December 2001 after the poor sales of Fallout Tactics.  Van Buren, Black Isle Studios' Fallout 3  Van Buren is the codename for the canceled version of Fallout 3 developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment. It featured an improved engine with real 3D graphics as opposed to sprites, new locations, vehicles, and a modified version of the SPECIAL system. The story disconnected from the Vault Dweller/Chosen One bloodline in Fallout and Fallout 2. Plans for the game included the ability to influence the various factions. The game was canceled in December 2003 when the budget cuts forced Interplay to dismiss the PC development team. Interplay subsequently sold the Fallout intellectual property to Bethesda Softworks, who began development on their own version of Fallout 3 unrelated to Van Buren. Main parts of the game were incorporated into Fallout 3 and its add-ons as well as Fallout: New Vegas.  Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2  Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel 2 is the canceled sequel to Brotherhood of Steel. The development of the game started before the completion of the original, and its development caused the cancellation of the Van Buren project. Like its predecessor, the game would have used the Dark Alliance Engine. It was targeted for a Christmas 2004 release date. It featured fourteen new weapons and ten new enemies. The game would have used a simplified reputation system based on previous entries; depending on whether the player was good or evil, the game would play out differently. Each of the four characters that were playable had a different fighting style, therefore every new play-through would have been a different experience. It had two player co-op action for players to experience the game with their friends. The Dark Alliance Engine would be fleshed out to refine player experience. A new stealth system would have been added to the game. This system would have allowed players to stalk enemies or stealthily assassinate them with a sniper rifle. For characters that could not use the sniper rifle, Interplay added a turret mode allowing those characters to use turrets.  Fallout Online  Fallout Online (previously known as Project V13) is a canceled project by Interplay and Masthead Studios to develop a Fallout-themed massively multiplayer online game. It entered production in 2008. In 2009, Bethesda filed a lawsuit against Interplay regarding Project V13, claiming that Interplay has violated their agreement as development has not yet begun on the project. On January 2, 2012, Bethesda and Interplay reached a settlement, the terms of which include the cancellation of Fallout Online and transfer of all rights in the franchise to Bethesda. Since then, Project V13 has been revived as a completely different project called Mayan Apocalypse, unrelated to Fallout.  Gameplay = SPECIAL = SPECIAL is a character creation and statistics system developed specifically for the Fallout series. SPECIAL is an acronym, representing the seven attributes used to define Fallout characters: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. SPECIAL is heavily based on GURPS, which was originally intended to be the character system used in the game. The SPECIAL system involves the following sets of key features: * Attributes (listed above) represent a character's core, inbred abilities. Attributes stay largely constant throughout the game, though they can be temporarily affected by drugs, altered indefinitely by conditions such as the wearing of Power Armor, the presence of certain NPCs or eye damage received in a critical hit, or permanently changed at certain points in the game through use of certain items or by taking certain perks. * Skills represent a character's chance of successfully performing a group of specific tasks (such as firing a gun, or picking a lock). They are represented as percentages, though these percentages can extend well beyond the expected maximum of 100%, at increased cost for skills over 100%. The SPECIAL stats continually add bonuses to skills. This is done passively, i.e. if the SPECIAL stats change, the bonuses are automatically and instantly adjusted. Skill Points that are earned each time the character levels up can be used to raise skill percentage. At character creation, the player selects three \\"tag skills\\" ‚Äî skills which can be increased at multiples of the normal rate, starting at one skill point per 2% skill at under 101% skill. The SPECIAL system was used in Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel. A modified version of the system was used in Fallout: Warfare, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout Shelter. Aside from Fallout games, modified versions of SPECIAL were also used in Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader (also referred to as Fallout Fantasy early in production), a fantasy role-playing video game that involved spirits and magic in addition to the traditional SPECIAL features, as well as the canceled project Black Isle's Torn. = The Pip-Boy and Vault Boy = The Fallout series' aesthetic is represented in the user interface of the Pip-Boy computer, and the frequent occurrences of the Vault Boy character, illustrating perks and mechanics. The Pip-Boy (Personal Information Processor- Boy) is a wrist-computer given to the player early in Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76 which serves various roles in quest, inventory, and battle management, as well as presenting player statistics. The model present in Fallout and Fallout 2 is identified as a Pip- Boy 2000, and both games feature the same unit, used first by the Vault Dweller and later inherited by the Chosen One. Fallout Tactics contains a modified version of the 2000 model, called Pip-Boy 2000BE, while Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas uses a Pip-Boy 3000. Fallout: New Vegas has a golden version of it, called the Pimp-Boy 3 Billion that is given to the player as a reward for completing a quest in a certain way. Fallout 4 contains a modified version of the 3000, called the Pip-Boy 3000 Mark IV. Fallout 76 contains a modified version of the Pip-Boy, called the Pip-Boy 2000 Mark VI, which is another version of the Pip-Boy 2000. The Vault Boy character is Vault-Tec's mascot, and is a recurring element in Vault-Tec products in the game world. This includes the Pip-Boy, where the Vault Boy illustrates all of the character statistics and selectable attributes. From Bethesda's Fallout 3 onward Vault Boy models all of the clothing and weaponry as well. The character was originally designed by Leonard Boyarsky, based partly on Rich Uncle Pennybags' aesthetic from the Monopoly board game, and drawn for Fallout by George Almond for the first few cards and by Tramell Ray Isaac, who finalized the look of the character.  Series overview  U.S. flag shown here is inspired by the Cowpens flag, but the center star is enlarged to represent the nation as a whole. = Setting = The series is set in a fictionalized United States in an alternate history scenario that diverges from reality following World War II. In this alternative atompunk \\"golden age\\", the transistor was never invented. As such, a bizarre socio- technological status quo emerges, in which advanced robots, nuclear-powered cars, directed-energy weapons, and other futuristic technologies are seen alongside 1950s-era computers and televisions. The United States divides itself into 13 commonwealths and the aesthetics and Cold War paranoia of the 1950s continue to dominate the American lifestyle well into the 21st century. More than a hundred years before the start of the series, an energy crisis emerged caused by the depletion of petroleum reserves, leading to a period called the \\"Resource Wars\\" in April 2052 ‚Äì a series of events which included a war between the European Commonwealth and the Middle East, the disbanding of the United Nations, the U.S. annexation of Canada, and a Chinese invasion and subsequent military occupation of Alaska coupled with their release of the \\"New Plague\\" that devastated the American mainland. These eventually culminated in the \\"Great War\\" on the morning of October 23, 2077, eastern standard time, a two-hour nuclear exchange on an apocalyptic scale, which subsequently created the post-apocalyptic United States, the setting of the Fallout world. = Vaults = Having foreseen this outcome decades earlier, the U.S. government began a nationwide project in 2054 to build fallout shelters known as \\"Vaults\\". The Vaults were ostensibly designed by the Vault- Tec as public shelters, each able to support up to a thousand people. Around 400,000 Vaults would have been needed, but only 122 were commissioned and constructed. Each Vault is self-sufficient, so they could theoretically sustain their inhabitants indefinitely. However, the Vault project was not intended as a viable method of repopulating the United States in these deadly events. Instead, most Vaults were secret, unethical social experiments and were designed to determine the effects of different environmental and psychological conditions on their inhabitants. Experiments were widely varied and included: a Vault filled with clones of an individual; a Vault where its residents were frozen in suspended animation; a Vault where its residents were exposed to psychoactive drugs; a Vault where one resident, decided by popular vote, is sacrificed each year; a Vault with only one man and puppets; a Vault where its inhabitants were segregated into two hostile factions; two Vaults with disproportionate ratios of men and women; a Vault where the inhabitants were exposed to the mutagenic Forced Evolutionary Virus (F.E.V.); and a Vault where the door never closed, exposing the inhabitants to the dangerous nuclear fallout. 17 control Vaults were made to function as advertised in contrast with the Vault experiments but were usually shoddy and unreliable due to most of the funding going towards the experimental ones. Subsequently, many Vaults had their experiments derailed due to unexpected events, and a number of Vaults became occupied by raiders, mutated animals or ghouls. = Post-War conditions = In the years after the Great War, the United States has devolved into a post-apocalyptic environment commonly dubbed \\"the Wasteland\\". The Great War and subsequent nuclear Armageddon has severely depopulated the country, leaving large expanses of property decaying from neglect. In addition, virtually all food and water is irradiated and most lifeforms have mutated due to high radiation combined with mutagens of varied origins. Despite the large-scale devastation, some areas were fortunate enough to survive the nuclear apocalypse relatively unscathed, even possessing non- irradiated water, flora, and fauna. However, these areas are exceedingly rare. With a large portion of the country's infrastructure in ruins, basic necessities are scarce. Barter is the common method of exchange, with bottle caps providing a more conventional form of currency. Most cities and towns are empty, having been looted or deserted in favor of smaller, makeshift communities scattered around the Wasteland. Many humans who could not get into the Vaults survived the atomic blasts, but many of these, affected by the radiation, turned into so-called \\"ghouls\\". While they were given an extended lifespan, many lost their hair and their skin decayed. Often, their voices became raspy giving them a zombie-like appearance. Ghouls often have a hatred towards humans due to jealousy or in response to discrimination. Ghouls typically resent any comparison to zombies, and being called a zombie is viewed as a great insult. If ghouls continue to be exposed to high levels of radiation, irreversible damage to their brains can cause them to become feral ghouls that attack almost anything on sight, having lost their minds. = Influences = Fallout satirizes the 1950s and 1960s fantasies of the United States' \\"post-nuclear-war-survival\\",Canavan, Gerry & Stanley, Kim (April 15, 2014). \\"Green Planets: Ecology and Science Fiction\\" Wesleyan University Press. p. 278. Tringham, Neal Roger (September 10, 2014). \\"Science Fiction Video Games.\\" CRC Press. p. 154. . Quote: \\"Its visual design has a strong \\"retro futurist style, drawing on cinematic influences ranging from Forbidden Planet (1956) to the Flash Gordon serials. Fallout's tone is often satirical, and on occasion cheerfully brutal.\\"Tom Bissell, Tom. (June 8, 2010) \\"Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter.\\" Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. p. 4-5. . Quote: \\"The first Fallout games, which were exclusive to the personal computer, were celebrated for their clever satire and often freakishly exaggerated violence.\\"David G. Embrick, Talmadge J. Wright, Andras Lukacs (March 1, 2012). \\"Social Exclusion, Power, and Video Game Play: New Research in Digital Media.\\" Lexington Books. p. 235. thus draws from 1950s pulp magazine science fiction and superhero comic books, all rooted in Atomic Age optimism of a nuclear- powered future, though gone terribly awry by the time the events of the game take place. The technology is retro-futuristic, with various Raygun Gothic machines such as laser weaponry and boxy Forbidden Planet-style robots. Computers use vacuum tubes instead of transistors (but still existed in a limited capacity), the architecture of ruined buildings feature Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, and Googie designs, direct-energy weapons resemble those used by Flash Gordon, and what few vehicles remain in the world are all 1950s-styled. Fallouts other production design, such as menu interfaces, are similarly designed to resemble advertisements and toys of the Atomic Age. Advertising in the game such as billboards and brochures has a distinct 1950s motif and feel. The lack of retro-stylization was a common reason for criticism in spin-off games, as well as modern features on weapons and other models. A major influence was A Boy and His Dog, where the main character Vic and his dog Blood scavenge the desert of the Southwestern United States, stealing for a living and evading bands of marauders, berserk androids, and mutants. It \\"inspired Fallout on many levels, from underground communities of survivors to glowing mutants.\\" Other film influences include the Mad Max series, with its depiction of a post-apocalyptic wasteland. In the first game, one of the first available armors is a one-sleeved leather jacket that resembles the jacket worn in Mad Max 2.  Tabletop games = Fallout: Warfare = Fallout: Warfare is a tabletop wargame based on the Fallout Tactics storyline, using a simplified version of the SPECIAL system. The rulebook was written by Christopher Taylor, and was available on the Fallout Tactics bonus CD, together with cut-out miniatures. Fallout: Warfare features five distinct factions, vehicles, four game types and 33 different units. The rules only require ten-sided dice. The modifications to the SPECIAL system allow every unit a unique set of stats and give special units certain skills they can use, including piloting, doctor, and repair. A section of the Fallout: Warfare manual allows campaigns to be conducted using the Warfare rules. It has been chosen for many awards and won game of the year. = Exodus = Exodus is a role-playing game published by Glutton Creeper Games using the d20 Modern/OGL system. At the beginning of the development this game was known as Fallout: Pen and Paper ‚Äì d20 however all connections to Fallout were dropped after a legal dispute with Bethesda. = Fallout = A board game titled Fallout was announced by Fantasy Flight Games in 2017 for a November release. = Fallout: Wasteland Warfare = The tabletop wargame Fallout: Wasteland Warfare was announced by Modiphius Entertainment in April 2017. It was released in March 2018.  Legal action  Interplay was threatened with bankruptcy and sold the full Fallout franchise to Bethesda, but kept the rights to the Fallout MMO through a back license in April 2007 and began work on the MMO later that year. Bethesda Softworks sued Interplay Entertainment for copyright infringement on September 8, 2009, regarding the Fallout Online license and selling of Fallout Trilogy and sought an injunction to stop development of Fallout Online and sales of Fallout Trilogy. Key points that Bethesda were trying to argue is that Interplay did not have the right to sell Fallout Trilogy on the Internet via Steam, Good Old Games or other online services. Bethesda also said that \\"full scale\\" development on Fallout Online was not met and that the minimum financing of 30 million of \\"secured funding\\" was not met. Interplay launched a counter suit claiming that Bethesda's claims were meritless and that it did have the right to sell Fallout Trilogy via online stores via its contract with Bethesda. Interplay also claimed secure funding had been met and the game was in full scale development by the cut off date. Interplay argued to have the second contract that sold Fallout voided which would result in the first contract that licensed Fallout to come back into effect. This would mean that Fallout would revert to Interplay. Bethesda would be allowed to make Fallout 5. Bethesda would have to pay 12% of royalties on Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and expansions plus interest on the money owed. On December 10, 2009, Bethesda lost the first injunction. Bethesda shortly afterward tried a new tactic and fired its first lawyer, replacing him and filing a second injunction, claiming that Interplay had only back-licensed the name Fallout but no content. Interplay has countered showing that the contract states that they must make Fallout Online that has the look and feel of Fallout and that in the event Interplay fails to meet the requirements (30 million minimum secure funding and \\"full scale\\" development by X date) that Interplay can still release the MMO but they have to remove all Fallout content. The contract then goes on to list all Fallout content as locations, monsters, settings and lore. Bethesda has known that Interplay would use Fallout elements via internet emails shown in court documents and that the contract was not just for the name. The second injunction by Bethesda was denied on August 4, 2011, by the courts. Bethesda then appealed the denial of their second preliminary injunction. Bethesda then sued Masthead Studios and asked for a restraining order against the company. Bethesda was denied this restraining order before Masthead Studios could call a counter-suit. Bethesda lost its appeal of the second injunction. Bethesda filed motion in limine against Interplay. Interplay filed a motion in limine against Bethesda the day after. The trial by jury which Bethesda requested on October 26, 2010, was changed to a trial by court because the APA contract stated that all legal matters would be resolved via a trial by court and not a trial by jury. The trial by court began on December 12. In 2012, in a press conference Bethesda revealed that in exchange for 2 million dollars, Interplay gave to them full rights for Fallout Online. Interplay's rights to sell and merchandise Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel expired on December 31, 2013.  Reception and legacy  The Fallout series has been met with mostly positive reception. The highest rated title is Fallout 3 and the lowest is Fallout 76 according to review aggregator Metacritic. = Controversy and fandom = Not all fans are happy with the direction the Fallout series has taken since its acquisition by Bethesda Softworks. Notorious for their vehement support of the series' first two games, Fallout and Fallout 2, members centered around one of the oldest Fallout fansites, No Mutants Allowed, have cried foul over departures from the original games' stories, gameplay mechanics and setting. Minor criticisms include the prevalence of unspoiled food after 200 years, the survival of wood-framed dwellings after a nuclear blast, and the ubiquity of Super Mutants at early levels in the game. More serious criticisms involve the quality of the game's writing, lack of verisimilitude, the switch to a first-person action game format, and the reactiveness of the surrounding game world to player actions. In response, Jim Sterling of Destructoid has called fan groups like No Mutants Allowed \\"selfish\\" and \\"arrogant\\"; stating that a new audience deserves a chance to play a Fallout game; and that if the series had stayed the way it was back in 1997, new titles would never have been made and brought to market. Luke Winkie of Kotaku tempers these sentiments, saying that it is a matter of ownership; and that in the case of Fallout 3, hardcore fans of the original series witnessed their favorite games become transformed into something else and that they are \\"not wrong\\" for having grievances. The redesigned dialogue interface featured in Fallout 4 received mixed reception by the community. Unsatisfied fans created mods for the game, providing subtitles and allowing the player to know what their character would say before choosing it as it was in previous games in the franchise such as in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. Though even taking the mods into account, Patricia Hernandez of Kotaku still criticized the writing of the game in her review, describing it as \\"thin\\", \\"You never have particularly long or nuanced conversations with the other characters. I like to play a Charisma-focused character, and I was disappointed.\\" The success of the series, especially from the third chapter developed by Bethesda, has led to the birth of groups of fans who gather on social networks and also in various comic fairs, where it is not uncommon to come across Cosplayer in Power Armor but also characters made with generic post-apocalyptic costumes to which various characteristic objects of the game are added such as the iconic bottles of Nuka Cola or the Pip-Boy worn by the various protagonists. In Italy, for example, every year since 2011 a parade dedicated to Fallout has been held within the Lucca Comics & Games event, while in other comic book fairs, thematic areas dedicated to Fallout are often set up, where official memorabilia or created by passionate are shown. The video games in the series often cite other video-game products and not, but the saga has also been the subject of tributes in other franchises, for example in the fifth season of BoJack Horseman there is an anthropomorphic bird wearing a Vault suit while in the first Rage , also developed by Bethesda, features a Vault Boy bobblehead, a collectible used in more recent chapters to increase the character's abilities. thumb Upon release, Fallout 76 became the lowest rated title in the series due to its mixed reception and criticisms from reviewers.https://segmentnext.com/2018/11/20/fallout-76-is-lowest-rated- fallout-game-in-history-fallout-4-dlcs-have-higher-scores/ It has been the subject of several controversies since its release.  Other media  In 1998, Interplay Entertainment founded the film division Interplay Films to make films based on its properties, and announced that a Fallout film was one of their first projects, along adaptations of Descent and Redneck Rampage. In 2000, Interplay confirmed that a film based on the original Fallout game was in production with Mortal Kombat: Annihilation screenwriter Brent V. Friedman attached to write a film treatment and with Dark Horse Entertainment attached to produce it. The division was later disbanded without any film produced, but Friedman's treatment was leaked on the Internet in 2011. In 2009, Bethesda Softworks expressed its interest in producing a Fallout film. After four extensions of the trademark without any use, Bethesda filed a \\"Statement of Use\\" with the USPTO in January 2012. In the next month, instead of a Fallout film, a special feature was made, entitled \\"Making of Fallout 3 DVD\\", which was accepted as a film on March 27 of the same year. This action removed the requirement to continue to re-register that mark indefinitely. In the DVD commentary of Mutant Chronicles, voice actor Ron Perlman stated that if a Fallout film was made, he would like to reprise his role as the Narrator. In 2016, Todd Howard stated that Bethesda had turned down the offers of making a film based on Fallout, but that he did not rule out the possibility. A Fallout television series based on the franchise was announced in July 2020. The series is created by Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan for Amazon Prime Video. The duo will also be writing and executive producing the series with their production company, Kilter Films, working alongside Bethesda Softworks and Bethesda Game Studios. Alongside Joy and Nolan, Kilter Films' Athena Wickham, Bethesda Softworks' James Altman, and Bethesda Game Studios' Todd Howard will also be executive producing the series.

Charles Connell (1810 - June 28, 1873) was a Canadian politician, now remembered mainly for placing his image on a 5-cent postage stamp. Born in Northampton in the then-British colony of New Brunswick to a family of Loyalists who had fled the American Revolution, he entered politics in 1846, serving in the colony's Legislative Assembly and House of Assembly.  Career  In 1858, Connell was appointed Postmaster General of the colony, at a time when increasing trade with the United States was forcing the British colonies to reconsider their currencies and institute a decimal system that would be more familiar to their American neighbors. New Brunswick adopted a decimal currency in 1859, and in the following year, Connell issued the first series of postage stamps in the new denomination. While few people had problems with the new currency, they were outraged that Connell chose to depict himself on the 5-cent stamp. In an effort to stem the criticism and charges of extreme arrogance, he offered to buy up all the stamps and burned them publicly on the front lawn of his house. He also resigned his office as postmaster general. It is unknown how many stamps survived, but they number no more than a few dozen and are now extremely rare.Scandalous stamp proofs sold at auction, CBC News, May 10, 2006 Some counterfeits of the stamp exist also. Despite the episode, Connell continued to serve in the colonial legislature up until 1867. He strongly urged passage of a bill that would have seen the lieutenant governor of N.B. elected, and not appointed by the British monarch.Charles Connell and His Stamp - The Stamp's Survival, J.J. MacDonald, The Canadian Philatelist, Sept.-Oct. 2000 A member of the Executive Council of New Brunswick, he served as Surveyor General from July 10, 1866 to July 17, 1867. An ardent supporter of Canadian Confederation, Connell was elected as a Member of Parliament representing the New Brunswick electoral district of Carleton in the first two Canadian parliaments. From 1865 to 1866, he published his own newspaper, The Union.  Family life  On August 5, 1835, he married Anne Fisher, daughter of Peter Fisher, and sister of Lewis P. Fisher. They had seven children, one of whom died young. She died on October 5, 1895 and is buried in the Old Methodist Cemetery in Woodstock, New Brunswick. His son George Heber went on to serve in the House of Commons.  Death and legacy  He died at his house on June 28, 1873. His 1840 house, known as the Charles Connell House is a National Historic Site, located in Woodstock, New Brunswick, and is now a museum run by the Carleton County Historical Society.

Empress Maud was escorted from Arundel to Bristol by William de Braose. William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber (fl. 1135-1179) was a 12th-century Marcher lord who secured a foundation for the dominant position later held by the Braose family in the Welsh Marches. In addition to the family's English holdings in Sussex and Devon, William had inherited Radnor and Builth, in Wales, from his father Philip. By his marriage he increased the Braose Welsh holdings to include Brecon and Abergavenny. William remained loyal to King Stephen during the 12th-century period of civil war. He became a trusted royal servant during the subsequent reign of Henry II, accompanying the king on campaigns in France and Ireland. He served as sheriff of Herefordshire from 1173 until 1175. The family's power reached its peak under his son William during the reigns of King Richard I and King John.  Lands and family  William was the eldest son of Philip de Braose, lord of Bramber. His mother was Aenor, daughter of Juhel of Totnes. He was the third in the line of the Anglo-Norman Braose family founded by his grandfather, the first William de Braose. After his father died in the 1130s William inherited lordships, land and castles in Sussex, with his caput at Bramber. He also held Totnes in Devon and Radnor and Builth in the Welsh Marches. He confirmed the grants of his father and grandfather to the abbey of St Florent in Anjou and made further grants to the abbey's dependent priory at Sele in Sussex. Charters 4, 6 & 8 notes In about 1155, he also inherited through his mother's family one half of the honour of Barnstaple in Devon, paying a fee of 1000 marks for the privilege. William became an internationally recognised figure. When Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury was asked by Pope Adrian IV to inquire into the background of a certain Walter, canon of St Ruf, his reply, dated to 1154/9 read: William had married Bertha, daughter of Miles of Gloucester and Sibyl de Neufmarch√©, by 1150. When each of Bertha's four brothers (Walter de Hereford, Henry FitzMiles (or Henry de Hereford), Mahel de Hereford and William de Hereford) died leaving no issue, William's marriage became unexpectedly valuable. He gained control of the lordships of Brecon and Abergavenny after 1166 when the last brother died. These additional land holdings greatly expanded the territorial power and income of the Braose family. They now held a vast block of territory in the Welsh Marches as well as their extensive interests in Sussex and Devon. William's daughters were able to make good marriages, notably Sibyl to William de Ferrers, Earl of Derby. Maud was married to John de Brompton of Shropshire. William's son and heir, another William de Braose, became a major player in national politics under King John.  Royal service  Empress Maud, the only legitimate living child of Henry I, landed in England in 1139 in an attempt to press her claim to the monarchy. She was soon besieged by King Stephen's forces at Arundel castle. Stephen allowed Maud a safe conduct to Bristol and provided her with an escort, which included William de Braose, Charter 5 notes suggesting that he was an adherent of King Stephen. William was present as a witness when three charters were issued by Stephen at Lewes dated to the years 1148‚Äì53, therefore it appears that he remained loyal to the king until the Treaty of Wallingford ended the hostilities. William was in Sussex in 1153, but he followed Duke Henry, soon to become King Henry II, to Normandy in 1154. William was frequently with the new king. He was one of the military leaders who supported Henry at Rhuddlan in 1157. He witnessed one of the king's charters at Romsey in 1158, and he is recorded at the king's court in Wiltshire in 1164 when the Constitutions of Clarendon were enacted. He accompanied the king on expedition to France, witnessing at Leons in 1161 and Chinon in 1162. William is also documented on the Irish campaign at Dublin in 1171 and Wexford 1172. William's younger brother, Philip, also accompanied the king to Ireland, and remained with the garrison at Wexford. In 1177 Philip was granted the kingdom of Limerick by Henry but failed to take possession after the citizens set fire to the town. When Henry was facing war with his sons in 1173, William was appointed as sheriff of Herefordshire at Easter. He maintained the King's interests in Herefordshire until 1175. Later life and death King Henry withdrew his favour from the family after William's son organised the murder of Seisyll ap Dyfnwal and other Welsh princes at Abergavenny in 1176. There is little subsequent record of William in public life, and it is likely that he retired to his estates in Sussex. William died after 1179 and was succeeded by his son, William de Braose, 4th Lord of Bramber, who gained the favour of both King Richard I and King John and became a dominant force in the Welsh Marches during their reigns.

Lineage William was the most notable member of the de Braose dynasty. His steady rise and sudden fall at the hands of King John is often taken as an example of that king's arbitrary and capricious behaviour towards his barons. William was the son of William de Braose, 3rd Lord of Bramber and his wife Bertha of Hereford, also known as Bertha de Pitres, (born 1130) daughter of Miles Fitz Walter, Earl of Hereford and his wife, Sibyl, daughter of Bernard de Neufmarche. From his father he inherited the Rape of Bramber, in Sussex, and through his mother he inherited a large estate in the Welsh Marches area of modern-day Monmouthshire. Abergavenny Massacre  In 1175, William de Braose carried out the Abergavenny Massacre, luring three Welsh princes and other Welsh leaders to their deaths. His principal antagonist was a Seisyll ap Dyfnwal, of Castell Arnallt near Llanover in the valley of the River Usk near Abergavenny, whom he blamed for the death of his uncle Henry. After having invited the Welsh leaders to a Christmas feast at Abergavenny Castle under the pretence of peace and the start of a new era at the end of the year (a traditional time for settling outstanding differences amongst the Welsh), he had them murdered by his men. This resulted in great hostility against him among the Welsh, who named him the \\"Ogre of Abergavenny\\". Gerald of Wales exonerates him and emphasises the religious piety of de Braose and his wife and de Braose generosity to the priories of Abergavenny and Brecon. William de Braose did however reputedly hunt down and kill Seisyll ap Dyfnwal's surviving son, Cadwaladr, a boy of seven. In 1192 William de Braose was made sheriff of Herefordshire, a post he held until 1199. In 1196 he was made Justice Itinerant for Staffordshire. In 1195 he accompanied King Richard I of England to Normandy and in 1199, William de Braose fought beside Richard at Ch√¢lus, where the king was mortally wounded. He then supported King John's claim to the throne of England, and represented the new king, making various royal grants. The disappearance of Arthur I, Duke of Brittany In 1203, William de Braose was put in charge of Arthur of Brittany, whom he had personally captured the previous year at the Battle of Mirebeau. William was suspected of involvement in Arthur's disappearance and death, although no concrete evidence ever came to light. There is somewhat better evidence that he at least knew the truth of the matter. William was in attendance with John in Normandy at the time of Arthur of Brittany's imprisonment and it was alleged that Arthur suffered the same fate as the Welsh princes at William's hand, although this has never been proven. Arthur's death remains a mystery. After Arthur disappeared, De Braose served in the war of 1204 against King Philip II of France in France.  Royal favourite  He was greatly favoured by King John early in his reign. John granted him all that he might conquer from the Welsh in Radnorshire, gave him lordship over Limerick in Ireland (save for the city itself), possession of Glamorgan castle, and the Lordship of Gower with its several castles. In early 1200, King John deprived Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler of all his offices and lands in Ireland because of his irregularities as sheriff. His lands were not restored until January 1202.Joliffe, J. E. A. Angevin Kingship London:Adam and Charles Black 1955 pp. 67-68 A manuscript in the National Library of Ireland points to William as the agent of his restoration: > \\"Grant by William de Braosa, (senior) to Theobald Walter (le Botiller) the > burgh of Kildelon (Killaloe) ... the cantred of Elykaruel (the baronies of > Clonlisk and Ballybritt, Co. Offaly), Eliogarty, Ormond, Ara and Oioney, > etc. 1201.\\"National Library of Ireland, Dublin D. 27 \\"Elykaruel\\" refers to the Gaelic tuath of \\"Ely O'Carroll\\", which straddled the southern part of County Offaly and the northern part of Tipperary (at Ikerrin). The other cantreds named are probably the modern baronies of Eliogarty, Ormond Upper, Ormond Lower and Owney and Arra in County Tipperary. Before 1206 William successfully claimed half of the barony of Totnes from Henry de Nonant, to which family it had been granted after its forfeiture from Juhel de Totnes.Sanders, Ivor, English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.90, Totnes In 1206, after his service in France, King John gave William de Braose the three great neighbouring trilateral castles of Gwent (Skenfrith Castle, Grosmont Castle, and White Castle). These have been interpreted as bribes encouraging silence on the demise of Arthur, seen by many as a rightful heir to the throne occupied by John of England. At this point only an earldom separated him from the greatest in England.  Royal persecution and death in exile Coat of arms attributed to William as it appears in Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, Parker Library MS 16 II (Chronica Majora). The arms are inverted to signify William's death. Soon after this, William de Braose fell out of favour with King John of England. The precise reasons remain obscure. King John cited overdue monies that de Braose owed the Crown from his estates, but the King's actions went far beyond what would be necessary to recover the debt. He distrained (seized) de Braose's English estates in Sussex and Devon, and sent a force to invade Wales to seize the de Braose domains there. Beyond that, he sought de Braose's wife, Maud de St. Valery, who, the story goes, had made no secret of her belief that King John had murdered Arthur of Brittany. De Braose fled to Ireland, then returned to Wales as King John had him hunted in Ireland. In Wales, William allied himself to the Welsh Prince Llywelyn the Great, and helped him in his rebellion against King John. In 1210, William de Braose fled Wales disguised as a beggar, to France. His wife and eldest son were captured. William died the following year in August 1211 at Corbeil, France. He was buried in the Abbey of St. Victor in Paris by a fellow exile and vociferous opponent of King John, Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury. His hopes to return alive to Wales and for a burial in Brecon were to be unfulfilled. William's wife, Maud, and eldest son, William, once captured, were allegedly murdered by King John, possibly starved to death while incarcerated at Windsor Castle and Corfe Castle in 1210. While William had aroused the jealousy of the other barons during his rise, the arbitrary and violent manner of his fall very probably discomfited them and played a role in the Baronial uprisings of the next decade. The historian Sidney Painter, in his biography of King John, called it \\"the greatest mistake John made during his reign, as the King revealed to his Barons once and for all his capacity for cruelty.\\"Painter, Sidney (1979), The Reign of King John. New York: Arno Press, pp. 249-250. The de Braose lineage William de Braose's eldest son, William, married Maud (Matilda) de Clare (ca. 1184‚Äì1213), the daughter of Richard de Clare, 3rd Earl of Hertford. This younger William was captured with his mother and starved to death in 1210. He had fathered four sons, John, Giles, Philip and Walter and although they were also held in prison, they were released in 1218. John, the eldest, was said to have been brought up secretly, in Gower, by a Welsh ally or retainer. On his release he came under the care of his uncle Giles de Braose. John made a claim to being the rightful heir of the de Braose lands and titles and although the courts did not find for him, his other uncle Reginald de Braose was able to cede by a legal convention the Baronies of both Gower and Bramber to him for a fee. This established John's branch of the family and positioned it for survival at least or, at best, an opportunity for continued future power and influence.  Later dynasty  The middle son, Giles de Braose, exiled in France until 1213, was Bishop of Hereford from 1200 until his death in 1215. He made peace with King John and agreed terms for regaining de Braose lands in 1215 but had also made alliances with the Welsh leader Llywelyn the Great. He died in 1215 before he could come into the lands. William's third son, Reginald de Braose reacquired his father's lands and titles for himself through simply seizing them back by force following the death of Giles. Reginald did not actually come to terms with the Crown until 1217 and the new, young King Henry III of England, after the death of King John. This, in turn, aroused the anger of Llywelyn the Great who had an understanding with Giles de Braose and the seeming duplicity caused the Welsh to attack de Braose lands in Brecon and Abergavenny and Gower. Abergavenny Castle had to be rebuilt as a result. Reginald de Braose died in 1228. William's eldest daughter Matilda/Maud married a prominent Welsh prince, Gruffydd ap Rhys II of Deheubarth. Another daughter, Margaret, married Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath in Ireland and himself another powerful Marcher Lord. [ There seem to be some confusion with Matilde on who her father is re Professor Thomas Jones Pierce, M.A., F.S.A., (1905-1964), Aberystwyth. she is the daughter of William Braose and Bertha Hereford the father of this William ] Fiction The story of the death of Maud de St. Valery and the conflict of her family with John Lackland is covered in several novels, notably Lady of Hay by Barbara Erskine. Erskine describes the life of Maud by sending a woman of the 20th century by psychological regression back into the 12th century.

He was an ill-fated member of the House of Braose, a powerful and long-lived dynasty of Marcher Lords. Biography William de Braose was born in Brecon, probably between 1197 and 1204. The Welsh, who detested him and his family name, called him Gwilym Ddu, Black William. He succeeded his father in his various lordships in 1227, including Abergavenny and Buellt. William married Eva Marshal, daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. They had four daughters: * Isabella de Braose (born c. 1222 - 1248), wife of Prince Dafydd ap Llywelyn * Maud de Braose (born c. 1224 ‚Äì 1301), wife of Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer another very powerful Marcher dynasty. * Eleanor de Braose (c. 1226 ‚Äì 1251), wife of Humphrey de Bohun and mother of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford. * Eva de Braose (c. 1227 - July 1255), wife of William de Cantilupe (died 1254). He was captured by the Welsh forces of Prince Llywelyn the Great, in fighting in the commote of Ceri near Montgomery, in 1228. William was ransomed for the sum of ¬£2,000 and then furthermore made an alliance with Llywelyn, arranging to marry his daughter Isabella de Braose to Llywelyn's only legitimate son Dafydd ap Llywelyn. However, it became known that William had committed adultery with Llywelyn's wife, Joan, Lady of Wales, and Braose was taken at his own home and transported to Wales.Dictionary of National Biography 34:11 The marriage planned between their two children did, however, take place.Dictionary of National Biography 14:201 The Chronicle of Ystrad Fflur's entry for 1230 reads: :\\"In this year William de Breos the Younger, lord of Brycheiniog, was hanged by the Lord Llywelyn in Gwynedd, after he had been caught in Llywelyn's chamber with the king of England's daughter, Llywelyn's wife\\". Llywelyn had William publicly hanged on 2 May 1230, (in Latin) possibly at Crogen, near Bala, though others believe the hanging took place near Llywelyn's palace at Abergwyngregyn. After William's death, his wife Eva continued to hold de Braose lands and castles in her own right. She was listed as the holder of Totnes in 1230, and was granted 12 marks to strengthen Hay Castle by King Henry III on the Close Rolls (1234‚Äì1237). Legacy With William's death by hanging and his having four daughters, who divided the de Braose inheritance between them and no male heir, the titles now passed to the junior branch of the de Braose dynasty, the only male heir was now John de Braose who had already inherited the titles of Gower and Bramber from his far-sighted uncle Reginald de Braose.

It was named after the Netherlands States-General, and its original Dutch name was identical to that of the New York borough of Staten Island. The island is administratively part of the Argentinian province of Tierra del Fuego, and of the department and city of Ushuaia. It has been declared an \\"Ecological, Historic, and Tourist Provincial Reserve\\" (\\"Reserva provincial ecol√≥gica, hist√≥rica y tur√≠stica\\"), with access limited to tours from Ushuaia. The only settlement is the Puerto Parry Naval Station, located in a deep and narrow fjord on the northern coast of the island. The naval station, established in 1978, is manned by a team of four marines on a 45-day rotation. They monitor environmental conservation and ship movements, and provide emergency assistance.In search of the lighthouse at the end of the world. (In Spanish) History Prior to European arrival, the island was visited by the Yamana people, who inhabited the islands south of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. The first European to encounter the island was the Spanish naval captain Francisco de Hoces, when in 1526 the ship San Lesmes, from the Spanish expedition of Loa√≠sa, separated from the rest in a storm, being displaced to the south parallel 55, becoming the discoverer of the great island east of Tierra del Fuego, which would later be called the Island of the States or Staten Island. Almost a century after the Spaniards, the Dutch explorers Jacob le Maire and Willem Schouten passed the island on 25 December 1615, naming it Staten Landt. Le Maire and Schouten sailed their ship, Eendracht, through a route south of the Straits of Magellan, a route now called the Le Maire Strait. To his left Le Maire noted the land mass which he called Staten Landt; he theorized it was perhaps a portion of the great 'Southern Continent.' (The first European name for New Zealand was Staten Landt, the name given to it by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman, who in 1642 became the first European to see the islands. Tasman also assumed it was part of the 'Southern Continent' later known as Antarctica.) The Dutch expedition to Valdivia of 1643 intended to sail through Le Maire Strait but strong winds made it instead drift south and east. The small fleet led by Hendrik Brouwer managed to enter the Pacific Ocean sailing south of the island disproving earlier beliefs that it was part of Terra Australis. No Europeans are known to have settled on the island for more than 200 years. In 1862 Argentine pilot Luis Piedrabuena established a shelter near Port Cook, and built a small seal oil extraction facility on the island.La Isla de los Estados y el Faro del Fin del Mundo, By Carlos Pedro Vairo. Ed., Zagier & Urruty Publications. 1998. On New Year's Day, 1775, Captain James Cook named what is now \\"Puerto A√±o Nuevo\\", \\"New Years Port\\". Seal hunters established a short-lived factory there (1786-1787), but abandoned it after Duke of York wrecked there on 11 September 1787 while bringing supplies. The island is also referenced in Richard Henry Dana Jr.'s book \\"Two Years Before the Mast\\" as the first land they see after leaving San Diego. He describes the land as \\". . . bare, broken, and girt with rocks and ice, with here and there, between rocks and broken hillocks, a little stunted vegetation of shrubs. . .\\" More than twenty years later, the San Juan del Salvamento Lighthouse was inaugurated on May 25, 1884, by Comodoro Augusto Lasserre. It operated until September 1900. The lighthouse, better known as Faro del fin del mundo (\\"Lighthouse at the end of the world\\"), is said to have inspired Jules Verne's novel The Lighthouse at the End of the World (1905). A military prison was based on the island from 1899 to 1902.

The Islas A√±o Nuevo, Isla Observatoria, and the Caleta Lacroix region on the west coast, however, have exposures of the Jurassic-Cretaceous Beauvoir Formation, mainly composed of shales, mudstones, limestones, and graywacke, plus silt, clay, sand and gravel glacial fluvial deposits. There are at least 18 fjords, with associated glacial sediments such as moraines and till, especially prevalent at Cape San Antonio and Cape Colnett on the north coast. Key fjords on the north coast include Port Hoppner, Port Parry, Port Basil Hall, Port A√±o Nuevo, Port Cook, and Port San Juan Del Salvamento going east to west.

Landsat Geocover 2000 image of Isla de los Estados, with Tierra del Fuego at the left Climate The island has a cold and humid climate and is characterized by rapid and unpredictable changes in the weather from day to day. Under the K√∂ppen climate classification, despite the vegetation, it would be classified as a mild tundra climate (ET), a cold climate with a mean temperature in the warmest month below with abundant precipitation year-round. The climate of the island is strongly influenced by the subpolar low pressure system which develops around the Antarctic Circle and the surrounding oceans. Being located between the semi‚Äìpermanent high pressure cell and the subpolar low (which does not change in intensity through the year and have little seasonal variation), the island is exposed to westerlies throughout the year. Temperatures are low year round but without extreme minimum temperatures. The mean temperature in summer is with mean extremes of and while in winter, the mean temperature is with mean extremes of and . Mean temperatures are lower than in Tierra del Fuego but due to the moderating influence of the ocean, extreme minimum temperatures are higher than in Tierra del Fuego. Coastal areas have average temperatures above in the coldest month while higher altitude locations may average below . Though no reliable records are available, it is estimated that the island averages around of precipitation per year. However, owing to its relief, precipitation is highly variable across the island. In the eastern parts of the island, it averages based on 4 years of data. Precipitation occurs frequently on the island, averaging 252 days with precipitation. June is the wettest month while October is the driest. Thunderstorms are very rare. Snow frequently falls during the winter months, averaging 33 days although snow can fall during Autumn and Spring. The island receives high cloud cover throughout the year, with 74% of the days being cloudy. June is the cloudiest month while October is the least cloudy month. Fog is uncommon, averaging only 16 days per year. Similar to the rest of Patagonia, the island is exposed to strong westerly winds. These winds often carry moisture with them, leading to frequent storms. Average wind speeds range from a high of in August to a low of in December. Flora and fauna Isla de los Estados is covered with dense low forests of Nothofagus southern beech. The animal life is composed mainly of penguins, orcas, seals, seagulls and cormorants, as well as the human- introduced deer and goats. The island is the location of one of the more southerly Atlantic breeding colonies of the Magellanic penguin.C. Michael Hogan (2008) Magellanic Penguin, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N.

Founded in 1874, Macalester is exclusively an undergraduate four- year institution and enrolled 2,174 students in the fall of 2018 from 50 U.S. states, 4 U.S territories, the District of Columbia and 97 countries. History Macalester College was founded by Rev. Dr. Edward Duffield Neill in 1874 with help from the Presbyterian Church in Minnesota. Edward had served as a chaplain in the Civil War and traveled to Minnesota Territory in 1849. He became connected politically and socially. He went on to found two local churches, was appointed the first Chancellor of the University of Minnesota and later became the first superintendent of public education for the state. In leaving the University of Minnesota Board of Regents he desired to build a religious college affiliated with the Presbyterian Church that would also be open to other Christian church members Modern Macalester College logo, used on many college documents. The original name of the college was called the Baldwin College and was affiliated with a Presbyterian secondary school called the Baldwin School. Due to a large donation from Charles Macalester, a prominent businessman and philanthropist from Philadelphia, the institution was renamed Macalester College. Charles donated a hotel called the Winslow House as the first permanent building to hold classes in. With additional funding from the Presbyterian Church and from the new College's trustees, Macalester opened for collegiate courses in 1885 with five teachers, six freshmen, and 52 preparatory students. In 1887 James Wallace joined the faculty and later became President. He helped to stabilize the finances of the college and later advance the institution. During this time, Macalester created a focus on a liberal arts curriculum. Weyerhaeuser Hall administration building In fall 2008 Macalester publicly launched a $150 million campaign. In 2009, construction was completed on Markim Hall, a new home for the Institute for Global Citizenship. Plans called for the building to qualify for Platinum certification under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system, a building rating system devised by the U.S. Green Building Council that evaluates the sustainability and environmental impact of structures across the nation. In fall 2012, Macalester opened its renovated and expanded Janet Wallace Fine Arts Center. Academics= President = Dr. Suzanne M. Rivera joined the college in 2020 as Macalester's 17th President.

About 60% of Macalester students study abroad before graduation.Statistics - International Center - Macalester College Eleven departments require off-campus study for completion of a major. Macalester has programs in the Netherlands, South Africa, Germany, Austria (e.g. at the University of Vienna), Singapore, and France. =Academic consortia memberships= Neill Hall Macalester is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC), a consortium of five liberal arts colleges in Saint Paul and Minneapolis formed to develop cooperative programs and offer cross-registration to their students. Other members include University of St. Thomas, Augsburg University, Hamline University, and St. Catherine University. In addition to over 800 courses available on campus, Macalester students have access to all courses offered through the consortium without paying additional tuition. ACTC provides free busing between the campuses to all students. Macalester also has an agreement with the Minneapolis College of Art and Design (MCAD) whereby students may take one course per term at that college, provided that Macalester has approved the course. Tuition and financial aid Macalester is committed to providing financial aid packages equal to the full demonstrated financial need of all admitted students. Two out of three Macalester students quality for need-based financial aid. Macalester also provides merit-based scholarships to around half of all students (most also receive need-based aid). Macalester's comprehensive tuition, room, and board fee for the 2019‚Äì2020 academic year is $68,884. Student life=Student body= Macalester is known for its high international enrollment for its institutional type as a percentage of its student body. As of fall 2018, international students constitute approximately 24% of the student body. Its 2,174 students come from 50 U.S. states, Washington DC, Puerto Rico, the Mariana Islands and 97 countries; 31% of the U.S. student body are students of color. Macalester's student body is 40% male and 60% female. =Student organizations= The main campus newspaper is the student-run The Mac Weekly, which has a circulation of up to 1,600 and was established in 1914. Almost all the newspaper staff works on a volunteer basis. The paper publishes 12 or 13 volumes, ranging from 12 to 24 pages, each semester. A satirical section, The Mock Weekly, is added to the last issue of each semester. The paper has published a magazine three times, in April 2006 and March and November 2007. There are over 100 student clubs and organizations on campus, including the college radio station WMCN, the Macalester Peace and Justice Committee, Chanter Literary and Arts Magazine, the Experimental College, Student Labor Action Coalition, African Music Ensemble, Macalester Gaming Society, Mac Anime, Macalester Mock Trial, Mac Dems, Mac GOP, Mac Greens, Bad Comedy, Fresh Concepts, The Macalester Review: A Political Magazine, The Hegemonocle Humor Magazine, a cappella groups including Scotch Tape, Sirens, Chromactics, Off Kilter, and The Trads; Cheeba, MacBrews, MacSlackers, MacBike, the Macalester Outing Club, the Macalester Climbing Club, Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG), Macalester Conservation and Renewable Energy Society (MacCARES), Fossil Free Mac, Macalester International Organization (MIO), MacPlayers, NARAL Macalester Activists for Choice, Queer Union, Macalester Young Artists for Revolutionary Needlework (MacYARN), Macalester Quiz Bowl, Mac Rugby, Medicinal Melodies, the Physics and Astronomy Club, and Club Water Polo (Sons of Neptune). =Civic engagement= Macalester is one of only 360 institutions that has been awarded the prestigious Carnegie Community Engagement Classification for excellence in civic engagement. Civic engagement is a core component of the Macalester education and is included in its mission statement. The college actively encourages student dialogue by bringing in speakers, hosting an International Roundtable to bring distinguished international scholars to discuss emerging global issues, and hosting collective meetings such as Women of Color. Macalester links academic learning to community involvement. In 2011‚Äì2012, 16 departments offered 59 courses with civic engagement components. Each year approximately 200 students complete internships, 65% of which are in the non- profit sector, schools, government, or the arts. Macalester also allows students to earn their work-study financial aid award while working at a local non-profit or elementary school. Almost all (96%) of students volunteer in the Twin Cities community while at Macalester. Many student organizations encourage active civic engagement, including MPIRG, Maction, Queer Union (QU), Macalester Habitat for Humanity, and more. Macalester is the primary financial contributor and sponsor of the Minnesota Institute for Talented Youth, which was founded in 1967 and has its main facilities in the Lampert Building. MITY provides two different gifted education programs during the summer months and one on weekends during the academic year. Macalester also participates in Project Pericles, a commitment to further encourage civic engagement at the college. In 2000, Macalester signed the Talloires Declaration, making a commitment to environmental sustainability, as well as a sweatshop pledge, making a commitment to fair-labor practices in the purchase of college apparel. =LGBTQ community= Macalester is widely recognized as one of the most LGBTQ-friendly colleges in the nation. The Campus Pride Index awarded Macalester a full five out of five stars for LGBTQ-friendly campuses. In 2007, The Princeton Review named Macalester the most gay-friendly college in the nation. For people whose gender expression is not always recognized, Macalester has started an initiative to ensure access to single-stall and all- gender bathrooms across campus.All Gender Bathrooms Macalester also offers all-gender housing on campus. Macalester has a student-powered Gender and Sexuality Resource Center that aims to build a culture of resistance against all forms of oppression. There are also many active LGBTQ student organizations and groups on campus including Queer Union, Allies Project Training, and the Macalester Out and Proud Community. Athletics The athletic teams of Macalester College are nicknamed the Scots. Macalester is a member of the NCAA Division III Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) in all sports except football. The Scots' football team set an NCAA Division III record by losing 50 straight games from 1974 to 1980. In 2018 this record was broken by Earlham College who lost 51 straight games. In 1977, Macalester set a Division III record by allowing 59.1 points per game. The losing streak ended in dramatic fashion: Kicker Bob Kaye put a 23-yarder through the uprights with 11 seconds remaining in an early September 1980 contest as the Scots beat Mount Senario College. The Scots left the MIAC after the 2001 season and competed as an independent until 2014, when they joined the Midwest Conference. Under head coach Tony Jennison, Macalester won the Midwest Conference title, the Scots' first conference football title since 1947. Macalester also won nine games in 2014, the most ever in a Scots' single season in their 121 years of intercollegiate football. Previously, the college actually dissolved the football program in 1906, pronouncing, according to the Mac Weekly: \\"Thoroughly aroused to the evils, real or imaginary, of this game, the public is clamoring for the entire abolition or reform on this 'relic of barbarism.'\\" The Leonard Center athletic and wellness complex Soccer has always been a popular sport at the college. Both men and women's teams remain competitive, appearing in multiple NCAA playoffs since 1995. The women's team won the NCAA championship in 1998. The 2010 men's team won the MIAC regular- season championship and both the men and women's teams received at-large bids for the 2010 NCAA Division III tournament. Both teams are well-supported by students, parents and alumni. One of Macalester sports fans' most (in)famous cheers ‚Äì \\"Drink Blood, Smoke Crack, Worship Satan, Go Mac!\\" ‚Äì was cited as one of \\"7 Memorable Sports Chants\\" by Mental Floss. The Cross Country Ski team became a club team in 2004, when skiing was eliminated as an MIAC sanctioned sport. A women's hockey team formed in 2000 and continues to play at the club level. Macalester Athletics compete in a new athletic facility, the Leonard Center, which opened in August 2008. The $45 million facility encompasses 175,000 square feet. The Leonard Center includes a 200-meter track, a natatorium, a fitness center, several multipurpose rooms, and a health and wellness center for the college community. Materials from the former facility were disposed of in environmentally friendly ways, and some materials were incorporated into the new structure. The Macalester Women's water polo team has won their conference championship in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Every year in early May, Macalester hosts the Al Storm Games, a fun competition between various athletes at Macalester consisting of various events such as a Hunger Games simulation. Campus=Housing= As at many small liberal arts colleges, students at Macalester are required to live on campus for their first two years. Limited all-gender housing options have been implemented by the college at select housing options starting in 2007. Residence halls * Dupre Hall, which houses first-year students and sophomores, is located on the corner of Summit and Snelling Avenues, and was built in 1962. Renovated in 1994, Dupre houses about 260 students and is Macalester's largest residence hall. * Turck Hall was built in 1957 and most recently remodeled in 2004. It houses nearly 180 first-year students. * Doty Hall was built in 1964 and is one of two residence halls on campus to feature single-sex floors. In 2012, Doty 1 was designated the gender-neutral or all-gender floor. * Bigelow Hall is on the corner of Grand Avenue and Macalester Street. Built in 1947 and most recently remodeled in 1992, it is connected via tunnels to Wallace, Doty and 30 Macalester Street and features single-sex and co-ed floor arrangements. It is also connected to Turck via a skyway, and houses sophomores. * George Draper Dayton Hall (GDD) houses sophomores, juniors and seniors, typically in suites of four to six occupants. * 30 Macalester Street is one of the newest residence halls on campus, and is more handicap accessible than other residence halls and houses a small number of students. It is a quiet and substance-free living community. * Wallace Hall is the oldest residence hall on campus, built in 1907 and renovated in 2002. It houses sophomores. Bigelow Hall houses sophomores * Kirk Hall houses upperclassmen and is located between the Campus Center and the Leonard Athletic Center. It contains singles, doubles, and triples. The doubles and triples each consists of a common room with singles branching off of it. *With the opening of the Institute for Global Citizenship, Summit House, which previously housed the International Center, has been converted into a residence hall housing 16 students. * There are three cottages on campus. Specialty housing * Summit House: Located across Snelling Avenue from Dupre Hall, the Summit House offers residence for up to sixteen upperclassmen. Starting in the Fall 2011 semester, the Summit House operated on a per semester cycle exclusively for students studying abroad for one half of the school's year. * Veggie Co-op: Located under the bleachers of the stadium, it houses 20 students who eat vegetarian meals together for most of the week. All food in the house is vegetarian. Students buy and make food together for their joined meals. * Cultural House: Located at 37 Macalester Street, residents of the Cultural House are usually required to work or volunteer for the Department of Multicultural Life and engage in moving towards a more diverse, accepting, and open campus environment. * All-gender housing (part of Kirk Hall) * Eco-House * Language Houses: Students are expected to speak the language of their particular house as much as possible. Currently there are six Language Houses, focusing on German, Japanese, French, Spanish, Russian, and Mandarin. * Inter-Faith House: Located in section 8 of Kirk, the Inter-Faith House is for students wishing to explore faith in their lives and the lives of others. =Food services= Food services on campus are provided by Bon App√©tit, a national company. The cafeteria, located in the Ruth Stricker Dayton Campus Center, is called Caf√© Mac. Three different meal plans are available for students who live on campus. All freshmen are required to have the highest meal plan offered. =Sustainability= In the 2011 College Sustainability Report Card published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, Macalester received an overall grade of \\"A‚àí\\", earning it the recognition as an \\"Overall Campus Sustainability Leader\\". In 2011, The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) awarded Macalester College a Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS) Silver Rating in recognition of its sustainability achievements. There are many student organizations on campus that focus on sustainability, including Macalester Conservation and Renewable Energy Society (MacCARES), Minnesota Public Interest Research Group (MPIRG), Mac Bike, Macalester Urban Land and Community Health (MULCH), and Outing Club.Sustainability - Student Organizations In April 2003, Macalester was able to install a 10 kW Urban Wind Turbine on-campus thanks to that year's senior class gift donating the installation cost and Xcel Energy donating the tower and turbine. The student organization MacCARES is currently developing a proposal for Macalester to invest in a Utility-Scale Wind Turbine in the range of 2MW. Other projects include the Eco-House, a student residence with a range of green features and research opportunities; a rain garden which prevents storm water from running-off into ground water, a bike share program, and a veggie co-op. Recently, the Class of 2008 designated its senior class gift to a Sustainability Fund to support initiatives to improve environmental sustainability on campus and in the greater community. On January 1, 2013, Macalester started on campus composting. Macalester declared a goal in September 2009 to become carbon neutral by 2025 and Zero-Waste by 2020. The school is a signatory to the Talloires Declaration and the American College and University President's Climate Commitment, the latter obligating the college to work toward carbon neutrality.Sustainability - Policies On April 18, 2012, President Brian Rosenberg signed the ‚ÄúCommitment to Sustainable Practices of Higher Education Institutions on the Occasion of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development‚Äù.On April 18, 2012, President Brian Rosenberg signed the ‚ÄúCommitment to Sustainable Practices of Higher Education Institutions on the Occasion of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development‚Äù In 2009, the school opened Markim Hall, a LEED Platinum building that houses the school's Institute for Global Citizenship. The building uses 45% less water and 75% less energy than a typical building in Minnesota. Macalester is currently planning on remodeling its Music, Theater, and Art buildings and is designing them to Minnesota B3 Guidelines. Recent sustainability efforts have highlighted the intersection of social justice and climate change at Macalester, as well as the potential conflict between the college's on-campus sustainability and its investments. Since 2012, the college has received criticism from students for making significant endowment investments in fossil fuel companies, including direct investments in oil & gas private partnerships. The student organization Fossil Free Mac has led a campaign urging the college to divest from fossil fuel companies. The campaign initially proposed full endowment divestment from the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies, which was not approved by Macalester's Social Responsibility Committee in 2015. In 2018, a revised proposal by Fossil Free Mac, advocating for a moratorium on the college's direct investment partnerships with oil & gas companies, was unanimously approved by the Social Responsibility Committee and is being considered by the board of trustees. The divestment campaign has received significant support from the student body, student government, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Vermicompost (vermi-compost) is the product of the decomposition process using various species of worms, usually red wigglers, white worms, and other earthworms, to create a mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding materials, and vermicast. This process is called vermicomposting, while the rearing of worms for this purpose is called vermiculture. Vermicast (also called worm castings, worm humus, worm manure, or worm faeces) is the end-product of the breakdown of organic matter by earthworms. These castings have been shown to contain reduced levels of contaminants and a higher saturation of nutrients than the organic materials before vermicomposting. Vermicompost contains water-soluble nutrients and is an excellent, nutrient- rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner.Coyne, Kelly and Erik Knutzen. The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City. Port Townsend: Process Self Reliance Series, 2008. It is used in farming and small scale sustainable, organic farming. Vermicomposting can also be applied for treatment of sewage. A variation of the process is vermifiltration (or vermidigestion) which is used to remove organic matter, pathogens and oxygen demand from wastewater or directly from blackwater of flush toilets. Overview Vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because, as compared with conventional composting, it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly. In manure composting, it also generates products that have lower salinity levels. The earthworm species (or composting worms) most often used are red wigglers (Eisenia fetida or Eisenia andrei), though European nightcrawlers (Eisenia hortensis, synonym Dendrobaena veneta) and red earthworm (Lumbricus rubellus) could also be used. Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers. Containing water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich organic fertilizer and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb. Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a \\"living\\" soil environment for plants. The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the drilosphere.Organic Phosphorus in the Environment, Turner, et al., Page 91. 2005 Design considerations=Suitable worm species= Species most often used for composting iinclude: * Eisenia fetida, the red wiggler or tiger worm (Eisenia andrei) * Lumbricus rubellus, does not adapt as well to the shallow compost bin as does Eisenia fetida * Eisenia hortensis, European nightcrawlers, aka dendrobaenas, dendras, and nightcrawlers * Eudrilus eugeniae, African Nightcrawlers * Perionyx excavatus, Blueworms may be used in the tropics. These species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout Europe and North America and live in rotting vegetation, compost, and manure piles. They may be an invasive species in some areas. As they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil, they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin. Composting worms are available to order online, from nursery mail-order suppliers or angling shops where they are sold as bait. They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water. Lumbricus terrestris (a.k.a. Canadian nightcrawlers (US) or common earthworm (UK)) are not recommended, since they burrow deeper than most compost bins can accommodate. =Large scale= Large-scale vermicomposting is practiced in Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States. The vermicompost may be used for farming, landscaping, to create compost tea, or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting. There are two main methods of large-scale vermiculture. Some systems use a windrow, which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population. The windrow method and compost windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste. Movement of castings through a worm bed The second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of \\"worm chow\\" across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed. Because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates. =Small scale= Demonstration home scale worm bin at a community garden site (painted plywood) Diagram of a household-scale worm composting bin For vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, Styrofoam, or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms. Some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release heavy metals into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material. Some cedars, yellow cedar, and redwood contain resinous oils that may harm worms, although western red cedar has excellent longevity in composting conditions. Hemlock is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins. Bins need holes or mesh for aeration. Some people add a spout or holes in the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection. The most common materials used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and wood. Worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced. Small-scale vermicomposting is well- suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality soil amendments, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that bin composting requires. Composting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler Eisenia fetida, are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as Lumbricus terrestris are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system. Other soil species that contribute include insects, other worms and molds. =Climate and temperature= There may be differences in vermicomposting method depending on the climate. It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high heat-retentive properties), as the raw materials or feedstocks used can compost, heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms. The most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (Eisenia fetida, Eisenia andrei, and Lumbricus rubellus) feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15‚Äì25 ¬∞C (59-77 ¬∞F). They can survive at 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F). Temperatures above 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) may harm them.Appelhof, p. 3 This temperature range means that indoor vermicomposting with redworms is possible in all but tropical climates. Other worms like Perionyx excavatus are suitable for warmer climates.Appelhof, p. 41 If a worm bin is kept outside, it should be placed in a sheltered position away from direct sunlight and insulated against frost in winter. Feedstock There are few food wastes that vermicomposting cannot compost, although meat waste and dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract vermin. Green waste should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bin. =Small-scale or home systems= Such systems usually use kitchen and garden waste, using \\"earthworms and other microorganisms to digest organic wastes, such as kitchen scraps\\". This includes: * All fruits and vegetables (including citrus, in limited quantities) * Vegetable and fruit peels and ends * Coffee grounds and filters * Tea bags (even those with high tannin levels) Grains such as bread, cracker and cereal (including moldy and stale) * Eggshells (rinsed off) * Leaves and grass clippings (not sprayed with pesticides) * Newspapers (most inks used in newspapers are not toxic) * Paper toweling (which has not been used with cleaners or chemicals) =Large- scale or commercial= Such vermicomposting systems need reliable sources of large quantities of food. Systems presently operatingLatest Developments In Mid-To-Large-Scale Vermicomposting use: * Dairy cow or pig manure *Sewage sludge * Brewery waste * Cotton mill waste * Agricultural waste * Food processing and grocery waste * Cafeteria waste * Grass clippings and wood chips Harvesting Worms in a bin being harvested Vermicompost is ready for harvest when it contains few-to-no scraps of uneaten food or bedding. There are several methods of harvesting from small-scale systems: \\"dump and hand sort\\", \\"let the worms do the sorting\\", \\"alternate containers\\" and \\"divide and dump.\\"Appelhof, pp. 79-86 These differ on the amount of time and labor involved and whether the vermicomposter wants to save as many worms as possible from being trapped in the harvested compost. The pyramid method of harvesting worm compost is commonly used in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins. In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which the rest of the process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow to the bottom of the pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms. When harvesting the compost, it is possible to separate eggs and cocoons and return them to the bin, thereby ensuring new worms are hatched. Cocoons are small, lemon-shaped yellowish objects that can usually be seen with the naked eye. The cocoons can hold up to 20 worms (though 2-3 is most common). Cocoons can lay dormant for as long as two years if conditions are not conducive for hatching. Properties Vermicompost has been shown to be richer in many nutrients than compost produced by other composting methods. It has also outperformed a commercial plant medium with nutrients added, but levels of magnesium required adjustment, as did pH. However, in one study it has been found that homemade backyard vermicompost was lower in microbial biomass, soil microbial activity, and yield of a species of ryegrass than municipal compost. It is rich in microbial life which converts nutrients already present in the soil into plant-available forms. Unlike other compost, worm castings also contain worm mucus which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil.Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998). The Worm Book: The Complete Guide to Gardening and Composting with Worms Ten Speed Press. p. 4. . Increases in the total nitrogen content in vermicompost, an increase in available nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as the increased removal of heavy metals from sludge and soil have been reported. The reduction in the bioavailability of heavy metals has been observed in a number of studies. Benefits Soil * Improves soil aeration * Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding enzymes such as phosphatase and cellulase) * Microbial activity in worm castings is 10 to 20 times higher than in the soil and organic matter that the worm ingests * Attracts deep-burrowing earthworms already present in the soil * Improves water holding capacityAppelhof, p. 111 Plant growth * Enhances germination, plant growth, and crop yield * Improves root growth and structure * Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding plant hormones such as auxins and gibberellic acid) Economic * Biowastes conversion reduces waste flow to landfills * Elimination of biowastes from the waste stream reduces contamination of other recyclables collected in a single bin (a common problem in communities practicing single- stream recycling) * Creates low-skill jobs at local level * Low capital investment and relatively simple technologies make vermicomposting practical for less-developed agricultural regions Environmental * Helps to close the \\"metabolic gap\\" through recycling waste on-site * Large systems often use temperature control and mechanized harvesting, however other equipment is relatively simple and does not wear out quickly * Production reduces greenhouse gas emissions such as methane and nitric oxide (produced in landfills or incinerators when not composted). Uses Mid-scale worm bin (1 m X 2.5 m up to 1 m deep), freshly refilled with bedding = Soil conditioner = Vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil, or mixed with water to make a liquid fertilizer known as worm tea. The dark brown waste liquid, or leachate, that drains into the bottom of some vermicomposting systems is not to be confused with worm tea. It is an uncomposted byproduct from when water- rich foods break down and may contain pathogens and toxins. It is best discarded or applied back to the bin when added moisture is needed for further processing. The pH, nutrient, and microbial content of these fertilizers varies upon the inputs fed to worms. Pulverized limestone, or calcium carbonate can be added to the system to raise the pH. Operation and maintenance Worms and fruit fly pupas under the lid of a home worm bin. =Smells= When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, it should have little smell‚Äîif any smell is present, it is earthy.Appelhof, p. 113 The smell may also depend on the type of composted material added to the bin. An unhealthy worm bin may smell, potentially due to low oxygen conditions. Worms require gaseous oxygen.Appelhof, p. 92 Oxygen can be provided by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of ammonia. =Moisture= Moisture must be maintained above 50%, as lower moisture content will not support worm respiration and can increase worm mortality. Operating moisture-content range should be between 70-90%, with a suggested content of 70-80% for vermicomposting-oriented vermiculture operations. If decomposition has become anaerobic, to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying, excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level. To do this, first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second, add fresh, dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin, mixing it in well.Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998). The Worm Book: The Complete Guide to Gardening and Composting with Worms Ten Speed Press. p. 70. . =Pest species= Pests such as rodents and flies are attracted by certain materials and odors, usually from large amounts of kitchen waste, particularly meat. Eliminating the use of meat or dairy product in a worm bin decreases the possibility of pests. Predatory ants can be a problem in African countries. In warm weather, fruit and vinegar flies breed in the bins if fruit and vegetable waste is not thoroughly covered with bedding. This problem can be avoided by thoroughly covering the waste by at least of bedding. Maintaining the correct pH (close to neutral) and water content of the bin (just enough water where squeezed bedding drips a couple of drops) can help avoid these pests as well. =Worms escaping= Worms generally stay in the bin, but may try to leave the bin when first introduced, or often after a rainstorm when outside humidity is high.Compost Worm Escape Maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem.Can you do vermicomposting in an apartment? =Nutrient levels= Commercial vermicomposters test, and may amend their products to produce consistent quality and results. Because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks, the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent. NPK testing may be helpful before the vermicompost or tea is applied to the garden. In order to avoid over-fertilization issues, such as nitrogen burn, vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water, or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with potting soil. Additionally, the mucous layer created by worms which surrounds their castings allows for a \\"time release\\" effect, meaning not all nutrients are released at once. This also reduces the risk of burning the plants, as is common with the use and overuse of commercial fertilizers. Application examples Vermicomposting (also known as vermiculture) is widely used in North America for on-site institutional processing of food scraps, such as in hospitals, universities, shopping malls, and correctional facilities. Vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling, such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls. It is selected either as a more environmentally friendly choice than conventional disposal, or to reduce the cost of commercial waste removal. Researchers from the Pondicherry University discovered that worm composts can also be used to clean up heavy metals. The researchers found substantial reductions in heavy metals when the worms were released into the garbage and they are effective at removing lead, zinc, cadmium, copper and manganese.

Together with their near-sisters the and es, their design formed the majority of the United States Navy's World War II submarine fleet.Typical Gato-class submarine diagram, USS MacKinnon website Named after the lead ship of the class, , the Gatos and their successors formed the core of the submarine service that was largely responsible for the destruction of the Japanese merchant marine and a large portion of the Imperial Japanese Navy in World War II. Gatos name comes from a species of small catshark. Like most other U.S. Navy submarines of the period, boats of the Gato class were given the names of marine creatures. In some references, the Gatos are combined with their successors, especially the Balao class. Design=AA-1 class and V-boats= The Gato-class boats were considered to be \\"Fleet Submarines\\". The original rationale behind their design was that they were intended to operate as adjuncts to the main battle fleet, based on standard-type battleships since World War I. They were to scout out ahead of the fleet and report on the enemy fleet's composition, speed, and course, then they were to attack and whittle down the enemy in preparation for the main fleet action, a titanic gun battle between battleships and cruisers. This was an operational concept born from experience in World War I. To operate effectively in this role, a submarine had to have high surface speed, long range and endurance, and heavy armament. Limitations in submarine design and construction in the 1920s and 1930s made this combination of qualities very difficult to achieve. The U.S. Navy experimented constantly with this concept in the post-World War I years, producing a series of submarines with less than stellar qualities and reliability, the (also known as the T class) and the V-boats, of which V-1 through V-3 were an unsuccessful attempt to produce a fleet submarine. =Tambor and Gar class= By 1931, the experimental phase of fleet submarine development was over and the Navy began to make solid progress towards what would eventually be the Gato class. By 1940, a much better developed industrial base and experience gained from the Porpoise-, -, and boats resulted in the Tambor and Gar classes. Finally, the U.S. Navy had hit the right combination of factors and now had the long-desired fleet submarine. Timing, however, conspired against the actual use of these boats in their assigned role. The attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 destroyed the Pacific Fleet battle line and along with it the concept of the battleship-led gun battle, as well as 20 years of submarine strategic concept development. It left the fleet submarine without a mission. Fortunately, the same capabilities that would have enabled these submarines to operate with the fleet made them superbly qualified for their new mission of commerce raiding against the Japanese Empire. =Gato class= The Gato-class design was a near-duplicate of the preceding Tambor- and Gar-class boats. The only significant differences were an increase in diving depth from to , and an extra five feet in length to allow the addition of a watertight bulkhead dividing the one large engine room in two, with two diesel generators in each room. The Gatos, along with nearly all of the U.S. Navy fleet-type submarines of World War II, were of partial double-hull construction. The inner pressure-resisting hull was wrapped by an outer, hydrodynamic hull. The voids between the two hulls provided space for fuel and ballast tanks. The outer hull merged with the pressure hull at both ends in the area of the torpedo room bulkheads, hence the \\"partial\\" double hull. Operational experience with earlier boats led the naval architects and engineers at the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair to believe that they had been unduly conservative in their estimates of hull strength. Without changing the construction or thickness of the pressure hull steel, they decided that the Gato-class boats would be fully capable of routinely operating at 300 feet, a increase in test depth over the preceding classes. The Gatos were slow divers when compared to some German and British designs, but that was mostly because the Gatos were significantly larger boats. Sufficient fuel bunkerage to provide the range necessary for 75-day patrols from Hawaii to Japan and back could only be obtained with a large boat, which would take longer to submerge than a smaller one. Acknowledging this limitation, the bureau designers incorporated a negative (sometimes called a \\"down express\\") tank into the design, which was flooded to provide a large amount of negative buoyancy at the start of the dive. Based on later wartime experience, the tank was normally kept full or nearly full at the surface, then emptied to a certain mark after the boat was submerged to restore neutral buoyancy. At the start of the war, these boats could go from fully surfaced to periscope depth in about 45‚Äì50 seconds. The superstructure that sat atop the pressure hull provided the main walking deck when the boat was surfaced and was free-flooding and full of water when the boat was submerged. When the dive began, the boat would \\"hang\\" for a few extra seconds while this superstructure filled with water. In an attempt to speed this process, additional limber, or free-flooding, holes were drilled and cut into the superstructure to allow it to flood faster. By midwar, these measures combined with improved crew training got dive times down to 30‚Äì35 seconds, very fast for such a large boat and acceptable to the boat's crew. The large size of these boats did negatively affect both surfaced and underwater maneuverability when compared to smaller submarines. No practical fix for this was available due to the limitations of the installed hydraulic systems used to move the rudder. Although a point of concern, the turning radius was still acceptable. After the war, a few fleet boats were fitted with an additional rudder topside at the very stern. The class of boats had numerous crew comforts including air conditioning, refrigerated storage for food, generous freshwater distilling units, clothes washers, and bunks for nearly every crew member; these were luxuries virtually unheard of in other navies. The bureau designers felt that if a crew of 60‚Äì80 men were to be expected to conduct 75-day patrols in the warm waters of the Pacific, these types of features were vital to the health and efficiency of the crew. They could be added without impact to the boat's war fighting abilities due to the extra room of the big fleet boat. The air conditioning in particular had a very practical application, too, besides comfort. Submerge a submarine for any length of time, and the heat generated by the recently shut-down engines, electronic gear, and 70 warm bodies will quickly raise internal temperatures above . High humidity generated by tropical waters will quickly condense and begin dripping into equipment, eventually causing electrical shorts and fires. Air conditioning, acting mostly as a dehumidifier, virtually eliminates this problem and greatly increases mechanical and electrical reliability. It proved to be a key factor in the success of these boats during World War II. Engine changes Twelve submarines of this class built by Electric Boat received what would be the final installations of the Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (HOR) double-acting diesel engine. The Navy had been tinkering with this engine off and on since 1937 because its unique design promised nearly twice the horsepower in a package the same size as other diesel engine types. Unfortunately, the HOR company ran into severe design and manufacturing problems, and these engines proved to be operational and maintenance nightmares. Frequent breakdowns and utter unreliability had destroyed these engines' reputation with the Navy and they were all removed at the first opportunity and replaced by General Motors Cleveland 16-278A V-type diesels. The other Gato-class boats received either the Fairbanks-Morse 38D 8-1/8 nine-cylinder opposed-piston engine or the General Motors Cleveland 16-248 V-type as original installations. These engines were hardy, rugged, and well liked by the crews and served the boats quite well. Fairwater changes At the beginning of the war, Gato-class boats, as well as the Gar and Tambor classes, had fully shrouded fairwaters visually similar to modern nuclear submarines. Experience during the war led to the progressive reduction of this structure to reduce visibility and radar profile at the expense of underwater performance and foul-weather operating comfort. Most of the subs in postwar movies show the final result of these modifications. A side benefit of these modifications was the creation of convenient locations for antiaircraft guns.\\"A Visual Guide to the U.S. Fleet Submarines Part One: Gato Class\\" By David L. Johnston Ships in class Seventy-seven of these boats were commissioned from November 1941 () through April 1944 (). Twenty of the 52 U.S. submarines lost in World War II were of this class, plus , a damaged boat that returned to the U.S., but was considered a constructive total loss and not repaired.‚Ä≥United States Submarine Losses World War II‚Ä≥, Naval History Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Washington: 1963 (Fifth Printing) Occasionally, some confusion arises as to the number of Gato-class submarines built, with some sources listing the total as 73, due to the transitional nature of the first four boats (SS-361 through SS-364) constructed under the second contract by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. These were originally intended to be Balao-class subs and were assigned hull numbers that fall in the middle of the range of numbers for the Balao class (SS-285 to SS-416, SS-425, and S-426).Fleet Submarine index page at Navsource.org Manitowoc was a designated follow-on yard to Electric Boat; they used construction blueprints and plans supplied by Electric Boat and used many of the same suppliers. The government-owned shipyards (Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Mare Island Naval Shipyard) began to make the transition to the new Balao design in the summer of 1942. Electric Boat, due to the huge backlog of Gato-class construction, was not ready to make the transition to the new design until January 1943. Manitowoc had already completed their allotted production run of Gatos and could not switch over to the Balao design until Electric Boat supplied them with the plans. Faced with a work stoppage while they waited for Electric Boat to catch up, managers at Manitowoc got permission to complete four additional boats (SS-361 through SS-364) to Electric Boat's Gato-class plans. Manitowoc's first Balao-class boat was .  World War II  Periscope photo of Japanese merchant ship sinking The Gato boats were authorized in appropriations for Fiscal Year 1941, as part of President Franklin Roosevelt's proclamation of \\"limited emergency\\" in September 1939. The first boat laid down was actually at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 11 September 1940. She was commissioned on 1 November 1941, and was the only Gato-class boat in commission when the war started. Gato herself was laid down on 5 October 1940 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, and commissioned 31 December 1941. Due to their large construction capacity, more than half (41) of the class was built at Electric Boat facilities; three new slipways were added to the north yard and four slipways were added to the south yard to accommodate their production. In addition, the government purchased an old foundry downstream from the main yard, constructed 10 slipways, and turned the yard over to Electric Boat. Called the Victory Yard, it became an integral part of Electric Boat operations. A total of 77 Gatos were built at four different locations (Electric Boat, Manitowoc, Portsmouth, and Mare Island). All of the Gatos (with one exception, ) would eventually fight in the Pacific Theater of Operations. However, in the summer of 1942, six new Gatos were assigned to Submarine Squadron 50 and sent to Rosneath, Scotland, to patrol the Bay of Biscay and to assist in the Operation Torch landings in North Africa. All in all, they conducted 27 war patrols, but could not claim any verified sinkings. Considered a waste of valuable resources, in mid-1943, all six boats were recalled and transferred to the Pacific. Once they began to arrive in theater in large numbers in mid-to-late 1942, the Gatos were in the thick of the fight against the Japanese. Many of these boats racked up impressive war records: , , and were the top three boats based on tonnage sunk by U.S. submarines. , Flasher, and were third, fourth, and seventh place on the list for the number of ships sunk. Gato-class boats sank four Japanese submarines: , , , and ; while only losing one in exchange, to . Their principal weapon was the steam- powered Mark 14 torpedo in the early war years, with the electric Mark 18 torpedo supplementing the Mark 14 in late 1943. Due to a stunted research-and- development phase in the Depression-era 1930s, and in great part due to the arrogance and stubbornness of its designer, the Naval Torpedo Station Newport under the Bureau of Ordnance, the \\"wonder weapon\\" Mark 14 proved to be full of bugs and very unreliable. They tended to run too deep, explode prematurely, run erratically, or fail to detonate. Bowing to pressure from the submariners in the Pacific, the bureau eventually acknowledged the problems in the Mark 14 and largely corrected them by late 1943. The Mark 18 electric torpedo was a hastily copied version of captured German G7e torpedo weapons and was rushed into service in the fall of 1943. Unfortunately, it also was full of faults, the most dangerous being a tendency to run in a circular pattern and come back at the sub that fired it. Once perfected, both types of torpedoes proved to be reliable and effective weapons, allowing the Gatos and other submarines to sink an enormous amount of Japanese shipping by the end of the war. The Gatos were subjected to numerous exterior configuration changes during their careers, with most of these changes centered on the conning tower fairwater. The large, bulky original configuration proved to be too easy to spot when the boat was surfaced; it needed to be smaller. Secondly, the desire to incorporate new masts for surface- and air-search radars drove changes to the fairwater and periscope shears. Third, additional gun armament was needed, and cutting down the fairwater provided excellent mounting locations for machine guns and antiaircraft cannon.A Visual Guide to the U.S. Fleet Submarines Part One: Gato Class (With a Tambor/Gar Class Postscript) 1941‚Äì1945 Johnston, David (2010) Navsource Naval History website The modifications (or mods) to the Gato-class conning tower fairwaters were fairly uniform in nature and they can be grouped together based on what was done when: * Mod 1 ‚Äì This is the original configuration with the covered navigation bridge, the high bulwark around the aft \\"cigarette\\" deck, and with the periscope shears plated over. All the early boats were built with this mod and it lasted until about mid-1942. * Mod 2 ‚Äì Same as mod 1, but with the bulwark around the cigarette deck cut down to reduce the silhouette. This also gave the .50 caliber machine gun mounted there a greatly improved arc of fire. Began to appear in about April 1942. * Mod 3 ‚Äì Same as mod 2, but with the covered navigation bridge on the forward part of the fairwater cut away and the plating around the periscope shears removed. In this configuration, the Gatos now had two excellent positions for the mounting of single 40 mm Bofors or twin 20 mm Oerlikon antiaircraft cannon, an improvement over the .50 caliber machine gun. This mod started to appear in late 1942 and early 1943. * Mod 4 ‚Äì Same as the mod 3, but with the height of the bridge itself lowered in a last attempt to lessen the silhouette. The lowering of the bridge exposed three I-beams on either side of the periscope shears. These exposed beams gave rise to the nickname \\"covered wagon boats\\". Began to appear in early 1944. Variations on the above mods included the 1A (shortened navigation bridge), 2A (plating removed from periscope shears), and the 3A and 4A (which moved the SJ radar mast aft of the periscopes).Johnston, pp. 2‚Äì16 The conning tower fairwater of Flasher is preserved in Groton, Connecticut, in the mod 4A configuration, with two single 40 mm Bofors mounts. Deck guns varied during the war. Many targets in the Pacific War were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo, so the deck gun was an important weapon. Most boats began the war with a 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber Mk. 17 gun (although some boats received older Mk. 6 mounts due to shortages). The 3-inch gun was the model originally specified for the Gato class, but war experience led to the removal of 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber Mk. 9 guns from old S-class submarines to equip front-line boats. Beginning in late 1943, almost all were refitted with a 5 inch (127 mm)/25 caliber Mk. 17 gun, and some boats had two of these weapons. Additional antiaircraft guns included single 40 mm Bofors and twin 20 mm Oerlikon mounts, usually one of each.  Notable examples  * sank the .

Her entire crew was rescued and subsequent attempts to destroy the wreck were only partially successful. As late as 1998, portions of Darters hulk were still visible on the reef. * recovered downed pilot LTJG George H. W.

Abele earned the submarine force's first Navy Cross, when his boat engaged in a running battle with Japanese ships off Kiska in July 1942. Grunion was subsequently lost in this action. In 2006 and 2007, expeditions organized and led by Abele's sons, Bruce, Brad, and John, located and photographed the wreck of the Grunion using side-scan sonar and a remotely operated vehicle. * was essentially the 53rd U.S. submarine loss of the war. Terribly damaged in an aircraft-borne depth charge attack on 14 November 1944, she barely limped back to port in Saipan. Temporarily patched up, she was sent back to the United States. Examined by engineers, she was found to be beyond economical repair and was decommissioned on 18 July 1945, never having made another war patrol. Her entire crew survived. * was commanded by Samuel D.

A week later, Tunny engaged the and inflicted enough damage for Musashi to return to dry dock for repairs. * , commanded by one of the submarine force's most famous skippers, Dudley W. \\"Mush\\" Morton, engaged in a running gun and torpedo battle with a convoy of four ships off the coast of New Guinea and destroyed the entire convoy. She was also one of the first U.S. subs into the Sea of Japan. She was sunk while exiting the Sea of Japan through the La Perouse Strait in October 1943 while on her seventh patrol. Postwar service At the end of World War II, the U.S. Navy found itself in an awkward position. The 56 remaining Gato-class submarines, designed to fight an enemy that no longer existed, were largely obsolete, despite the fact they were only two to four years old. Such was the pace of technological development during the war that a submarine with only a 300-foot test depth was going to be of little use, despite being modern in most other aspects. Enough of the Balao and Tench boats, with their greater diving depth, remained that the Gatos were superfluous for front-line missions. The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) modernization program of the late 1940s largely passed these boats by. Only and received GUPPY conversions; these were austere GUPPY IB modernizations prior to their transfer to Italy.List of GUPPY IB conversions However, the U.S. Navy found itself new missions to perform, and for some of these the Gatos were well suited.GUPPY and other diesel boat conversions page The last two Gato-class boats active in the U.S. Navy were Rock and Bashaw, which were both decommissioned on 13 September 1969 and sold for scrap. =Radar picket= The advent of the kamikaze demonstrated the need for a long-range radar umbrella around the fleet. Surface ships refitted with powerful radar suites were put into service, but they proved vulnerable in this role, as they could be attacked, as well, leaving the fleet blind. A submarine, though, could dive and escape aerial attack. After experimenting with the concept on several Balao and Tench-class boats, and realizing that a deep diving depth was not overly important in this role, six Gatos were taken in hand (, , , , , and ) for conversion. They were lengthened by to provide additional space for an air control center and had powerful air-search and height-finding radars installed, with the after torpedo room converted into an electronics space with torpedoes and tubes removed. They also received a streamlined \\"sail\\" in place of the traditional conning tower fairwater. Redesignated SSR and called the \\"Migraine III\\" conversion, these boats were only moderately successful in this role, as the radars themselves proved troublesome and somewhat unreliable. The radars were removed and the boats temporarily reverted to general-purpose submarines after 1959.Whitman, Edward C. \\"Cold War Curiosities: U.S. Radar Picket Submarines, Undersea Warfare, Winter‚ÄìSpring 2002, Issue 14 =Hunter-killer= The threat of the Soviet Navy building hundreds of Type XXI-derived submarines (eventually the 215-strong and dozens of others) in the Atlantic led the U.S. Navy to adapt submarines to specifically hunt other submarines, a radically new role for the 1950s. Concluding that this role did not require a fast or deep-diving submarine (this line of thought would quickly change with the advent of nuclear power), seven Gatos were converted to SSKs (hunter-killer submarines) between 1951 and 1953, joining three purpose-built K-1-class SSKs entering service at that time. The Gato class was chosen because large numbers were available in the reserve fleet should rapid mobilization become necessary, and the deeper- diving classes were more suitable for GUPPY rather than SSK conversions. A streamlined GUPPY-style sail was installed, a large sonar array was wrapped around the bow (losing two torpedo tubes in the process), the boats were extensively silenced including the removal of the two forward diesel engines, and they received a snorkel. was the test boat for the concept, having her sonar array at the forward end of the sail instead of the better position at the bow. The other boats in the program included , , , , , and . Eventually, more advanced sonars were installed on the new nuclear boats, with introducing the bow-mounted sonar sphere, and the SSK mission was folded into the regular attack submarine role. , commissioned in 1960, was an attempt to develop a slow but ultra-quiet nuclear-powered SSK equivalent, but no others were built. The slow and less capable diesel SSKs were decommissioned or reassigned to other roles in 1959, and all except Croaker and Cavalla (eventually preserved as memorials) were scrapped in 1968 and 1969. =Guided missile submarine= fires a Regulus I missile The Regulus nuclear cruise missile program of the 1950s provided the U.S. Navy with its first strategic missile capability. was converted in 1953 to house and fire this large surface-launched missile and was designated SSG (guided missile submarine). She could carry two of the missiles in a cylindrical hangar on the aft deck. She made strategic deterrent patrols with Regulus until 1964, when the program was discontinued in favor of Polaris. =Transport submarine= With the retirement of the Regulus missile system in 1965, was converted into a troop transport in 1966. She was redesignated as an APSS (transport submarine), replacing in this role. Her Regulus hangar became a lockout chamber for UDT, SEAL, and Marine Force Recon teams in the Vietnam War. On 1 January 1969, Tunnys designation was changed to LPSS (amphibious transport submarine); however, she was replaced by and decommissioned in June of that year. =Submarine oiler= was converted to a SSO in 1950 to carry fuel oil, gasoline, and cargo to amphibious beachheads. She received additional \\"saddle\\" tanks wrapped around her outer hull to carry these fuels and a streamlined sail. After a few tests, the concept was dropped in 1951 as impractical, and Guavina served in the test role for a few years. In 1957, she converted back to the oiler/tanker role and carried the designation AOSS. This time, she experimented with refueling seaplanes at sea, which was potentially important, as refueling the nuclear-capable Martin P6M Seamaster at sea could improve the Navy's strategic strike capabilities. However, this mission, too, was dropped after a few years and Guavina was decommissioned. =Sonar test submarine= Grouper after conversion to a sonar test submarine The development of advanced sonar systems took on a great deal of importance in the 1950s, and several fleet boats were outfitted with various strange-looking sonar transducer arrays and performed extensive tests. Two Gatos, and (previously the prototype hunter-killer boat) were assigned to these duties and proved to be key players in the development of new sonar capabilities. Grouper had all her forward torpedo tubes removed and the space was used as berthing for technicians and as a sonar lab. Flying Fish was decommissioned in 1954, but Grouper continued in the test role until 1968. =Naval Reserve trainer= Interested in maintaining a ready pool of trained reservists, the Navy assigned numerous fleet boats to various coastal and inland ports (even in Great Lakes ports such as Chicago, Cleveland, and Detroit) where they served as a training platform during the reservists' weekend drills. Twenty-eight Gato-class boats served in this capacity, some as late as 1971. In this role, the boats were rendered incapable of diving and had their propellers removed. They were used strictly as pierside trainers. These were in commission, but classed as \\"in commission in reserve\\", thus some were decommissioned and recommissioned on the same day to reflect the change in status.All post war data from Reserve Training Boats at SubmarineSailor.com =Foreign service= The large numbers of relatively modern, but surplus U.S. fleet submarines proved to be popular in sales, loans, or leases to allied foreign navies. While most of these boats were of the more capable Balao and Tench classes, some Gatos went overseas, as well. Italy received two ( and ), which received the only GUPPY conversions given to Gato-class boats (Guppy IB). Japan received one (), Brazil two ( and ), Greece two ( and ), and Turkey two ( and ). The boats transferred to Japan and Brazil did not receive any modernizations (streamlining and snorkels) prior to transfer, but the four boats sent to Greece and Turkey did receive snorkels and partial streamlining to the fairwater.. Note: Alden makes a rare error here. Guitarro and Hammerhead did not receive the standard U.S. Navy \\"Fleet Snorkel\\" conversion prior to transfer, as he stated in the Part V addenda. Although they did receive full snorkel installations, Guitarro and Hammerheads conversions were very similar to Jack and Lapon in that their conning tower fairwaters and snorkels received only a partial streamlining. The periscope shears and covered wagon ribs were left exposed. The official Fleet Snorkel conversion had a GUPPY-style fully enclosed and streamlined fairwater/snorkel, hence called a \\"sail\\". The confusion probably stemmed from the fact that in posttransfer overhauls (probably done in the U.S. but paid for by the Greeks) both boats received GUPPY-style sails.  Museum boats  Six Gato-class submarines are open to public viewing. They primarily depend on revenue generated by visitors to keep them operational and up to U.S. Navy standards; each boat gets a yearly inspection and a \\"report card\\". Some boats, such as Cod and Silversides, have been used in film production. = Surviving ships = The following is a complete list of Gato-class museum boats: * is at Seawolf Park near Galveston, Texas (in SSK configuration).USS Cavalla memorial website * is at the Wisconsin Maritime Museum in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.USS Cobia memorial website * is on display in Cleveland, Ohio.

Developers use game engines to construct games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers. The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes a rendering engine (\\"renderer\\") for 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and may include video support for cinematics. Implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, in large part, the same game engine to produce different games or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms. Purpose In many cases, game engines provide a suite of visual development tools in addition to reusable software components. These tools are generally provided in an integrated development environment to enable simplified, rapid development of games in a data-driven manner. Game-engine developers attempt to \\"pre-invent the wheel\\" by developing robust software suites which include many elements a game developer may need to build a game. Most game-engine suites provide facilities that ease development, such as graphics, sound, physics and artificial-intelligence (AI) functions. These game engines are sometimes called \\"middleware\\" because, as with the business sense of the term, they provide a flexible and reusable software platform which provides all the core functionality needed, right out of the box, to develop a game application while reducing costs, complexities, and time-to-market ‚Äî all critical factors in the highly competitive video-game industry. , Gamebryo, JMonkeyEngine and RenderWare were widely-used middleware programs of this type. Like other types of middleware, game engines usually provide platform abstraction, allowing the same game to run on various platforms (including game consoles and personal computers) with few, if any, changes made to the game source-code. Often, programmers design game engines with a component-based architecture that allows specific systems in the engine to be replaced or extended with more specialized (and often more expensive) game-middleware components. Some game engines comprise a series of loosely connected game middleware components that can be selectively combined to create a custom engine, instead of the more common approach of extending or customizing a flexible integrated product. However achieved, extensibility remains a high priority for game engines due to the wide variety of uses for which they are applied. Despite the specificity of the name \\"game engine\\", end-users often re-purpose game engines for other kinds of interactive applications with real-time graphical requirements - such as marketing demos, architectural visualizations, training simulations, and modeling environments.Report on Use of Middleware in Games Some game engines only provide real-time 3D rendering capabilities instead of the wide range of functionality needed by games. These engines rely upon the game developer to implement the rest of this functionality or to assemble it from other game-middleware components. These types of engines are generally referred to as a \\"graphics engine\\", \\"rendering engine\\", or \\"3D engine\\" instead of the more encompassing term \\"game engine\\". This terminology is inconsistently used, as many full-featured 3D game engines are referred to simply as \\"3D engines\\". Examples of graphics engines include: Crystal Space, Genesis3D, Irrlicht, OGRE, RealmForge, Truevision3D, and Vision Engine. Modern game- or graphics-engines generally provide a scene graph - an object-oriented representation of the 3D game-world which often simplifies game design and can be used for more efficient rendering of vast virtual worlds. As technology ages, the components of an engine may become outdated or insufficient for the requirements of a given project. Since the complexity of programming an entirely new engine may result in unwanted delays (or necessitate that a project re-start from the beginning), an engine-development team may elect to update their existing engine with newer functionality or components. Components Such a framework is composed of a multitude of very different components. =Main game program= The actual game logic has to be implemented by some algorithms. It is distinct from any rendering. =Rendering engine= The rendering engine generates animated 2D or 3D graphics by any of a number of methods (rasterization, ray-tracing etc.). Instead of being programmed and compiled to be executed on the CPU or GPU directly, most often rendering engines are built upon one or multiple rendering application programming interfaces (APIs), such as Direct3D, OpenGL, or Vulkan which provide a software abstraction of the graphics processing unit (GPU). Low-level libraries such as DirectX, Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL), and GLFW are also commonly used in games as they provide platform-independent access to the windowing system and allow the application to allocate a surface on a computer screen where the graphics will be displayed, this is commonly referred to as graphical context creation. These libraries usually also provide access to other computer hardware such as input devices (mouse, keyboard, and joystick), network cards, and sound cards. Before hardware- accelerated 3D graphics, software renderers had been used. Software rendering is still used in some modeling tools or for still-rendered images when visual accuracy is valued over real-time performance (frames-per-second) or when the computer hardware does not meet needs such as shader support. With the advent of hardware accelerated physics processing, various physics APIs such as PAL and the physics extensions of COLLADA became available to provide a software abstraction of the physics processing unit of different middleware providers and console platforms. Game engines can be written in any programming language like C++, C or Java, though each language is structurally different and may provide different levels of access to specific functions. Often a Scripting Language like Javascript / ECMAScript gets added as the second layer to speed up the development. =Audio engine= The audio engine is the component which consists of algorithms related to the loading, modifying and output of sound through the client's speaker system. At a minimum it must be able to load, decompress and play sound files. More advanced audio engines can calculate and produce such things as Doppler effects, echoes, pitch/amplitude adjustments, oscillation, etc. It can perform calculations on the CPU, or on a dedicated ASIC. Abstraction APIs, such as OpenAL, SDL audio, XAudio 2, Web Audio, etc. are available. =Physics engine= The physics engine is responsible for simulating the laws of physics realistically within the application. Specifically, it provides a set of functions for simulating physical forces and collisions, acting on the various objects within the game at run time. =Artificial intelligence= The AI is usually outsourced from the main game program into a special module to be designed and written by software engineers with specialist knowledge. Most games will implement very different AI systems, and thus, AI is considered to be specific to the particular game for which it is created. Many modern game engines come packaged with search algorithms such as A-star and subroutines for baking level geometry into a Navmesh which can help speed up the process of scripting AI behavior. History id's Quake engine which resulted in the id Tech family Before game engines, games were typically written as singular entities: a game for the Atari 2600, for example, had to be designed from the bottom up to make optimal use of the display hardware‚Äîthis core display routine is today called the kernel by retro developers. Other platforms had more leeway, but even when the display was not a concern, memory constraints usually sabotaged attempts to create the data-heavy design that an engine needs. Even on more accommodating platforms, very little could be reused between games. The rapid advance of arcade hardware‚Äîwhich was the leading edge of the market at the time‚Äîmeant that most of the code would have to be thrown out afterwards anyway, as later generations of games would use completely different game designs that took advantage of extra resources. Thus most game designs through the 1980s were designed through a hard-coded ruleset with a small number of levels and graphics data. Since the golden age of arcade video games, it became common for video game companies to develop in-house game engines for use with first party software. While third-party game engines were not common up until the rise of 3D computer graphics in the 1990s, there were several 2D game creation systems produced in the 1980s for independent video game development. These include Pinball Construction Set (1983), ASCII's War Game Construction Kit (1983), Alt URL Thunder Force Construction (1984), Alt URL Adventure Construction Set (1984), Garry Kitchen's GameMaker (1985), Wargame Construction Set (1986), Shoot-'Em-Up Construction Kit (1987), Arcade Game Construction Kit (1988), and most popularly ASCII's RPG Maker engines from 1998 onwards. Klik & Play (1994) is another legacy offering that's still available. The term \\"game engine\\" arose in the mid-1990s, especially in connection with 3D games such as first-person shooters (FPS). (See also: first-person shooter engine.) Such was the popularity of Id Software's Doom and Quake games that, rather than work from scratch, other developers licensed the core portions of the software and designed their own graphics, characters, weapons and levels‚Äîthe \\"game content\\" or \\"game assets\\". Separation of game- specific rules and data from basic concepts like collision detection and game entity meant that teams could grow and specialize. Later games, such as id Software's Quake III Arena and Epic Games's 1998 Unreal were designed with this approach in mind, with the engine and content developed separately. The practice of licensing such technology has proved to be a useful auxiliary revenue stream for some game developers, as one license for a high-end commercial game engine can range from US$10,000 to millions of dollars, and the number of licensees can reach several dozen companies, as seen with the Unreal Engine. At the very least, reusable engines make developing game sequels faster and easier, which is a valuable advantage in the competitive video game industry. While there was a strong rivalry between Epic and id around 2000, since then Epic's Unreal Engine has been far more popular than id Tech 4 and its successor id Tech 5. Modern game engines are some of the most complex applications written, often featuring dozens of finely tuned systems interacting to ensure a precisely controlled user experience. The continued evolution of game engines has created a strong separation between rendering, scripting, artwork, and level design. It is now common, for example, for a typical game development team to have several times as many artists as actual programmers. First-person shooter games remain the predominant users of third- party game engines, but they are now also being used in other genres. For example, the role-playing video game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and the MMORPG Dark Age of Camelot are based on the Gamebryo engine, and the MMORPG Lineage II is based on the Unreal Engine. Game engines are used for games originally developed for home consoles as well; for example, the RenderWare engine is used in the Grand Theft Auto and Burnout franchises. Threading is taking on more importance due to modern multi-core systems (e.g. Cell) and increased demands in realism. Typical threads involve rendering, streaming, audio, and physics. Racing games have typically been at the forefront of threading with the physics engine running in a separate thread long before other core subsystems were moved, partly because rendering and related tasks need updating at only 30‚Äì60 Hz. For example, on PlayStation 3, physics ran in Need For Speed at 100 Hz versus Forza Motorsport 2 at 360 Hz. Although the term was first used in the 1990s, there are a few earlier systems in the 1980s that are also considered to be game engines, such as Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) and SCI systems, LucasArts' SCUMM system and Incentive Software's Freescape engine (in 1986). Unlike most modern game engines, these game engines were never used in any third-party products (except for the SCUMM system which was licensed to and used by Humongous Entertainment). As game engine technology matures and becomes more user-friendly, the application of game engines has broadened in scope. They are now being used for serious games: visualization, training, medical, and military simulation applications, with the CryEngine being one example. To facilitate this accessibility, new hardware platforms are now being targeted by game engines, including mobile phones (e.g. Android phones, iPhone) and web browsers (e.g. WebGL, Shockwave, Flash, Trinigy's WebVision, Silverlight, Unity Web Player, O3D and pure DHTML). Additionally, more game engines are being built upon higher level languages such as Java and C#/.NET (e.g. TorqueX, and Visual3D.NET), Python (Panda3D), or Lua Script (Leadwerks). As most 3D rich games are now mostly GPU-limited (i.e. limited by the power of the graphics card), the potential slowdown due to translation overheads of higher level languages becomes negligible, while the productivity gains offered by these languages work to the game engine developers' benefit. These recent trends are being propelled by companies such as Microsoft to support Indie game development. Microsoft developed XNA as the SDK of choice for all video games released on Xbox and related products. This includes the Xbox Live Indie Games channel designed specifically for smaller developers who don't have the extensive resources necessary to box games for sale on retail shelves. It is becoming easier and cheaper than ever to develop game engines for platforms that support managed frameworks.  Game engines as an industry  Producers of game engines decide how they allow users to utilize their products. Just as gaming is an industry, so are the engines they are built off. The major game engines come at varying prices, whether it be in the form of subscription fees or license payments. Unreal Engine 4, one of the major game engines and used to create several notable games such as Fortnite, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, and Life Is Strange 2, adopted a free-to-use structure with a royalty on all game sales using this engine. Although the differences among the different game engines blur as they are built upon during the game creation process, different game developers may either be too used to a system to change, or attracted by the huge benefits of such engines regardless of pay-walls. Another game engine currently bringing in a notable income is the Unity engine, utilizing a similar pay module to the Unreal Engine. This engine is behind games such as Rust, Subnautica, and Life Is Strange: Before the Storm. Game middleware In the broader sense of the term, game engines themselves can be described as middleware. In the context of video games, however, the term \\"middleware\\" is often used to refer to subsystems of functionality within a game engine. Some game middleware does only one thing but does it more convincingly or more efficiently than general purpose middleware. For example, SpeedTree was used to render the realistic trees and vegetation in the role-playing video game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fork Particle was used to simulate and render real time particle system visual effects or particle effects in Sid Meier's Civilization V. The four most widely used middleware packages that provide subsystems of functionality include RAD Game Tools' Bink, Firelight FMOD, Havok, and Scaleform GFx. RAD Game Tools develops Bink for basic video rendering, along with Miles audio, and Granny 3D rendering. Firelight FMOD is a low cost robust audio library and toolset. Havok provides a robust physics simulation system, along with a suite of animation and behavior applications. Scaleform provides GFx for high performance Flash UI and high-quality video playback, and an Input Method Editor (IME) add-on for in-game Asian chat support. Other middleware is used for performance optimisation - for example 'Simplygon' helps to optimise and generate level of detail meshes, and 'Umbra' adds occlusion culling optimisations to 3d graphics. Some middleware contains full source code, others just provide an API reference for a compiled binary library. Some middleware programs can be licensed either way, usually for a higher fee for full source code. First-person shooter engines A subset of game engines are 3D first-person shooter (FPS) game engines. Groundbreaking development in terms of visual quality is done in order to get FPS games to its current standard. The level of visual details emphasized in these games have become increasingly precise, something that engines focused on flight and driving simulators and real-time strategy (RTS) games don't contain. The development of the FPS graphic engines that appear in games can be characterized by a steady increase in technologies, with some breakthroughs. Attempts at defining distinct generations lead to arbitrary choices of what constitutes a highly modified version of an \\"old engine\\" and what is a brand- new engine. The classification is complicated as game engines blend old and new technologies. Features that were considered advanced in a new game one year become the expected standard the next year. Games with a mix of older generation and newer feature are the norm.

Living Standards Measurement Papers, The World Poverty line is usually calculated by finding the total cost of all the essential resources that an average human adult consumes in one year.Poverty Lines ‚Äì Martin Ravallion, in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition, London: Palgrave Macmillan The largest of these expenses is typically the rent required for accommodation, so historically, economists have paid particular attention to the real estate market and housing prices as a strong poverty line affect. Individual factors are often used to account for various circumstances, such as whether one is a parent, elderly, a child, married, etc. The poverty threshold may be adjusted annually. In practice, like the definition of poverty, the official or common understanding the poverty line is significantly higher in developed countries than in developing countries.Hagenaars, Aldi & de Vos, Klaas The Definition and Measurement of Poverty. Journal of Human Resources, 1988Hagenaars, Aldi & van Praag, Bernard A Synthesis of Poverty Line Definitions. Review of Income and Wealth, 1985 In October 2015, the World Bank updated the International Poverty Line (IPL), a global absolute minimum, to $1.90 per day. By this measure, the percentage of the global population living in absolute poverty fell from over 80% in 1800 to 10% by 2015, according to United Nations estimates, which found roughly 734 million people remained in absolute poverty. History The poverty threshold was first developed by Mollie Orshansky between 1963-1964. She attributed the poverty threshold as a measure of income inadequacy by taking the cost of food plan per family of three or four and multiplying it by a factor of three.In 1969 the inter agency poverty level review committee adjusted the threshold for only price changes. Charles Booth, a pioneering investigator of poverty in London at the turn of the 20th century, popularised the idea of a poverty line, a concept originally conceived by the London School Board. Booth set the line at 10 (50p) to 20 shillings (¬£1) per week, which he considered to be the minimum amount necessary for a family of four or five people to subsist on. Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree (1871‚Äì1954), a British sociological researcher, social reformer and industrialist, surveyed rich families in York, and drew a poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money \\"necessary to enable families ‚Ä¶ to secure the necessaries of a healthy life\\", which included fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. Based on data from leading nutritionists of the period, he calculated the cheapest price for the minimum calorific intake and nutritional balance necessary, before people get ill or lose weight. He considered this amount to set his poverty line and concluded that 27.84% of the total population of York lived below this poverty line. p. 298 This result corresponded with that from Charles Booth's study of poverty in London and so challenged the view, commonly held at the time, that abject poverty was a problem particular to London and was not widespread in the rest of Britain. Rowntree distinguished between primary poverty, those lacking in income and secondary poverty, those who had enough income, but spent it elsewhere (1901:295‚Äì96). Absolute poverty and the International Poverty Line  The term \\"absolute poverty\\" is also sometimes used as a synonym for extreme poverty. Absolute poverty is the absence of enough resources to secure basic life necessities. Poverty headcount ratio at $1.90 a day (2011 PPP) (% of population). Based on World Bank data ranging from 1998 to 2018. To assist in measuring this, the World Bank has a daily per capita international poverty line (IPL), a global absolute minimum, of $1.90 a day as of October 2015. The new IPL replaces the $1.25 per day figure, which used 2005 data. In 2008, the World Bank came out with a figure (revised largely due to inflation) of $1.25 a day at 2005 purchasing-power parity (PPP).Ravallion, Martin; Chen Shaohua & Sangraula, Prem Dollar a day The World Bank Economic Review, 23, 2, 2009, pp. 163‚Äì84 The new figure of $1.90 is based on ICP purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations and represents the international equivalent of what $1.90 could buy in the US in 2011. Most scholars agree that it better reflects today's reality, particularly new price levels in developing countries. The common IPL has in the past been roughly $1 a day.Sachs, Jeffrey D. The End of Poverty 2005, p. 20 These figures are artificially low according to Peter Edward of Newcastle University. He believes the real number as of 2015 was $7.40 per day. Using a single monetary poverty threshold is problematic when applied worldwide, due to the difficulty of comparing prices between countries. Prices of the same goods vary dramatically from country to country; while this is typically corrected for by using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates, the basket of goods used to determine such rates is usually unrepresentative of the poor, most of whose expenditure is on basic foodstuffs rather than the relatively luxurious items (washing machines, air travel, healthcare) often included in PPP baskets. The economist Robert C. Allen has attempted to solve this by using standardized baskets of goods typical of those bought by the poor across countries and historical time, for example including a fixed calorific quantity of the cheapest local grain (such as corn, rice, or oats). Robert C. Allen, 2017. Absolute Poverty: When Necessity Displaces Desire REVISED, Working Papers 20170005, New York University Abu Dhabi, Department of Social Science, revised Jun 2017. =Basic needs= The basic needs approach is one of the major approaches to the measurement of absolute poverty in developing countries. It attempts to define the absolute minimum resources necessary for long-term physical well-being, usually in terms of consumption goods. The poverty line is then defined as the amount of income required to satisfy those needs. The 'basic needs' approach was introduced by the International Labour Organization's World Employment Conference in 1976. \\"Perhaps the high point of the WEP was the World Employment Conference of 1976, which proposed the satisfaction of basic human needs as the overriding objective of national and international development policy. The basic needs approach to development was endorsed by governments and workers' and employers' organizations from all over the world. It influenced the programmes and policies of major multilateral and bilateral development agencies, and was the precursor to the human development approach.\\" A traditional list of immediate \\"basic needs\\" is food (including water), shelter, and clothing. Many modern lists emphasize the minimum level of consumption of 'basic needs' of not just food, water, and shelter, but also sanitation, education, and health care. Different agencies use different lists. According to a UN declaration that resulted from the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen in 1995, absolute poverty is \\"a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education, and information. It depends not only on income, but also on access to services.\\" David Gordon's paper, \\"Indicators of Poverty and Hunger\\", for the United Nations, further defines absolute poverty as the absence of any two of the following eight basic needs: * Food: Body mass index must be above 16. * Safe drinking water: Water must not come solely from rivers and ponds, and must be available nearby (fewer than 15 minutes' walk each way). * Sanitation facilities: Toilets or latrines must be accessible in or near the home. * Health: Treatment must be received for serious illnesses and pregnancy. * Shelter: Homes must have fewer than four people living in each room. Floors must not be made of soil, mud, or clay. * Education: Everyone must attend school or otherwise learn to read. * Information: Everyone must have access to newspapers, radios, televisions, computers, or telephones at home. * Access to services: This item is undefined by Gordon, but normally is used to indicate the complete panoply of education, health, legal, social, and financial (credit) services. In 1978, Ghai investigated the literature that criticized the basic needs approach. Critics argued that the basic needs approach lacked scientific rigour; it was consumption-oriented and antigrowth. Some considered it to be \\"a recipe for perpetuating economic backwardness\\" and for giving the impression \\"that poverty elimination is all too easy\\". Amartya Sen focused on 'capabilities' rather than consumption. In the development discourse, the basic needs model focuses on the measurement of what is believed to be an eradicable level of poverty. Relative poverty Relative poverty means low income relative to others in a country: for example, below 60% of the median income of people in that country. Relative poverty measurements unlike absolute poverty measurements take the social economic environment of the people observed into consideration. It is based on the assumption that whether a person is considered poor depends on its income share relative to other people‚Äôs income shares that are living in the same economy. The threshold for relative poverty is considered to be at 50% of a country‚Äôs median equivalised disposable income after social transfers. Thus, it can vary greatly from country to country even after adjusting for purchasing power standards (PPS). A person can be poor in a relative term but not in absolute term as the person might be able to meet its basic needs, but it is not able however to enjoy the same standards of living as other people in the same economy are enjoying. Relative poverty is thus a form of social exclusion that can for example effect peoples access to decent housing, education or job opportunities. The relative poverty measure is used by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Canadian poverty researchers. In the European Union, the \\"relative poverty measure is the most prominent and most‚Äìquoted of the EU social inclusion indicators.\\" \\"Relative poverty reflects better the cost of social inclusion and equality of opportunity in a specific time and space.\\" \\"Once economic development has progressed beyond a certain minimum level, the rub of the poverty problem ‚Äì from the point of view of both the poor individual and of the societies in which they live ‚Äì is not so much the effects of poverty in any absolute form but the effects of the contrast, daily perceived, between the lives of the poor and the lives of those around them. For practical purposes, the problem of poverty in the industrialized nations today is a problem of relative poverty (page 9).\\" However, some have argued that as relative poverty is merely a measure of inequality, using the term 'poverty' for it is misleading. For example, if everyone in a country's income doubled, it would not reduce the amount of 'relative poverty' at all. =History of the concept of relative poverty= In 1776, Adam Smith argued that poverty is the inability to afford \\"not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, even of the lowest order, to be without.\\" In 1958, John Kenneth Galbraith argued, \\"People are poverty stricken when their income, even if adequate for survival, falls markedly behind that of their community.\\" In 1964, in a joint committee economic President's report in the United States, Republicans endorsed the concept of relative poverty: \\"No objective definition of poverty exists. ... The definition varies from place to place and time to time. In America as our standard of living rises, so does our idea of what is substandard.\\" In 1965, Rose Friedman argued for the use of relative poverty claiming that the definition of poverty changes with general living standards. Those labelled as poor in 1995, would have had \\"a higher standard of living than many labelled not poor\\" in 1965. In 1967, American economist Victor Fuchs proposed that \\"we define as poor any family whose income is less than one-half the median family income.\\" This was the first introduction of the relative poverty rate as typically computed today In 1979, British sociologist, Peter Townsend published his famous definition: \\"individuals... can be said to be in poverty when they lack the resources to obtain the types of diet, participate in the activities and have the living conditions and amenities which are customary, or are at least widely encouraged or approved, in the societies to which they belong (page 31).\\" Brian Nolan and Christopher T. Whelan of the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Ireland explained that \\"poverty has to be seen in terms of the standard of living of the society in question.\\" Relative poverty measures are used as official poverty rates by the European Union, UNICEF and the OEDC. The main poverty line used in the OECD and the European Union is based on \\"economic distance\\", a level of income set at 60% of the median household income. =Relative poverty compared with other standards= A measure of relative poverty defines \\"poverty\\" as being below some relative poverty threshold. For example, the statement that \\"those individuals who are employed and whose household equivalised disposable income is below 60% of national median equivalised income are poor\\" uses a relative measure to define poverty. The term relative poverty can also be used in a different sense to mean \\"moderate poverty\\" ‚Äì for example, a standard of living or level of income that is high enough to satisfy basic needs (like water, food, clothing, housing, and basic health care), but still significantly lower than that of the majority of the population under consideration. National poverty lines 2008 CIA World Factbook-based map showing the percentage of population by country living below that country's official poverty line National estimates are based on population-weighted subgroup estimates from household surveys. Definitions of the poverty line do vary considerably among nations. For example, rich nations generally employ more generous standards of poverty than poor nations. Even among rich nations, the standards differ greatly. Thus, the numbers are not comparable among countries. Even when nations do use the same method, some issues may remain.\\"http://inequalitywatch.eu/spip.php?article99\\" Eurostat 2010 =United Kingdom= In the UK, \\"more than five million people ‚Äì over a fifth (23 percent) of all employees ‚Äì were paid less than ¬£6.67 an hour in April 2006.

For urban dwellers, the poverty line is defined as living on less than 538.60 rupees (approximately US$12) per month, whereas for rural dwellers, it is defined as living on less than 356.35 rupees per month (approximately US$7.50). In 2019, the Indian government stated that 6.7% of its population is below its official poverty limit. As India is one of the fastest-growing economies in 2018, poverty is on the decline in the country, with close to 44 Indians escaping extreme poverty every minute, as per the World Poverty Clock.India lifted 271 million people out of poverty in a 10-year time period from 2005/06 to 2015/16. Brookings Institute, June 2018 alt=India A comparative map of poverty in the world in 2012, at national poverty line, according to the World Bank. =United States= In United States, the poverty thresholds are updated every year by Census Bureau. The threshold in United States are updated and used for statistical purposes. In 2020, in the United States, the poverty threshold for a single person under 65 was an annual income of US$12,760; the threshold for a family group of four, including two children, was US$26,200. According to the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey 2018 One-year Estimates, 13.1% of Americans lived below the poverty line. Women and children Street children in Cebu, Philippines Women and children find themselves impacted by poverty more often when a part of single mother families. This is due to the feminization of poverty , how the poverty rate of women has increasingly exceeded that of men‚Äôs. While the overall poverty rate is 12.3%, women poverty rate is 13.8% which is above the average and men are below the overall rate at 11.1%. Women and children (as single mother families) find themselves as a part of low class communities because they are 21.6% more likely to fall into poverty. However, extreme poverty, such as homelessness, disproportionately affects males to a high degree. Racial minorities A minority group is defined as ‚Äúa category of people who experience relative disadvantage as compared to members of a dominant social group.‚Äù Minorities are traditionally separated into the following groups: African Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. According to the current U.S. Poverty statistics, Black Americans - 21%, Foreign born non-citizens - 19%, Hispanic Americans - 18%, and Adults with a disability - 25%. This does not include all minority groups, but these groups alone account for 85% of people under the poverty line in the United States. Whites have a poverty rate of 8.7%; the poverty rate is more than double for Black and Hispanic Americans. Impacts on education Living below the poverty threshold can have a major impact on a child‚Äôs education. The psychological stresses induced by poverty may affect a student‚Äôs ability to perform well academically. In addition, the risk of poor health is more prevalent for those living in poverty. Health issues commonly affect the extent to which one can continue and fully take advantage of his or her education. Poor students in the United States are more likely to dropout of school at some point in their education. Research has also found that children living in poverty perform poorly academically and have lower graduation rates. Impoverished children also experience more disciplinary issues in school than others. Schools in impoverished communities usually do not receive much funding, which can also set their students apart from those living in more affluent neighborhoods. There is much dispute over whether upward mobility that brings a child out of poverty may or may not have a significant positive impact on his or her education; inadequate academic habits that form as early as preschool typically are unknown to improve despite changes in socioeconomic status. Impacts on healthcare The nation‚Äôs poverty threshold is issued by the Census Bureau. According to the Office of Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation the threshold is statistically relevant and can be a solid predictor of people in poverty. The reasoning for using Federal Poverty Level, FPL, is due to its action for distributive purposes under the direction of Health and Human Services. So FPL is a tool derived from the threshold but can be used to show eligibility for certain federal programs. Federal poverty levels have direct effects on individual‚Äôs healthcare. In the past years and into the present government, the use of the poverty threshold has consequences for such programs like Medicaid and the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program. The benefits which different families are eligible for are contingent on FPL. The FPL, in turn is calculated based on federal numbers from the previous year. The benefits and qualifications for federal programs are dependent on number of people on a plan and the income of the total group. For 2019, the U.S Department of health & Human Services enumerate what the line is for different families. For a single person, the line is $12,490 and up to $43,430 for a family of 8, in the lower 48 states. Another issue is reduced-cost coverage. These reductions are based on income relative to FPL, and work in connection with public health services such as Medicaid. The divisions of FPL percentages are nominally, above 400%, below 138% and below 100% of the FPL. After the advent of the American Care Act, Medicaid was expanded on states bases. For example, enrolling in the ACA kept the benefits of Medicaid when the income was up to 138% of the FPL. Poverty mobility and healthcare Health Affairs along with analysis by Georgetown found that public assistance does counteract poverty threats between 2010 and 2015. In regards to Medicaid, child poverty is decreased by 5.3%, and Hispanic and Black poverty by 6.1% and 4.9% respectively. The reduction of family poverty also has the highest decrease with Medicaid over other public assistance programs. Expanding state Medicaid decreased the amount individuals paid by an average of $42, while it increased the costs to $326 for people not in expanded states. The same study analyzed showed 2.6 million people were kept out of poverty by the effects of Medicaid. From a 2013-2015 study, expansion states showed a smaller gap in health insurance between households making below $25,000 and above $75,000. Expansion also significantly reduced the gap of having a primary care physician between impoverished and higher income individuals. In terms of education level and employment, health insurance differences were also reduced. Non-expansion also showed poor residents went from a 22% chance of being uninsured to 66% from 2013 to 2015. Poverty dynamics Living above or below the poverty threshold is not necessarily a position in which an individual remains static. As many as one in three impoverished people were not poor at birth; rather, they descended into poverty over the course of their life. Additionally, a study which analyzed data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) found that nearly 40% of 20-year-olds received food stamps at some point before they turned 65. This indicates that many Americans will dip below the poverty line sometime during adulthood, but will not necessarily remain there for the rest of their life. Furthermore, 44% of individuals who are given transfer benefits (other than Social Security) in one year do not receive them the next. Over 90% of Americans who receive transfers from the government stop receiving them within 10 years, indicating that the population living below the poverty threshold is in flux and does not remain constant. Cutoff issues Most experts and the public agree that the official poverty line in the United States is substantially lower than the actual cost of basic needs. In particular, a 2017 Urban Institute study found that 61% of non-elderly adults earning between 100-200% of the poverty line reported at least one material hardship, not significantly different from those below the poverty line. The cause of the discrepancy is believed to be an outdated model of spending patterns based on actual spending in the year 1955; the number and proportion of material needs has risen substantially since then. =Variability= The U.S. Census Bureau calculates the poverty line the same throughout the U.S. regardless of the cost-of-living in a state or urban area. For instance, the cost-of-living in California, the most populous state, was 42% greater than the U.S. average in 2010, while the cost-of-living in Texas, the second-most populous state, was 10% less than the U.S. average. In 2017, California had the highest poverty rate in the country when housing costs are factored in, a measure calculated by the Census Bureau known as \\"the supplemental poverty measure\\". Government transfers to alleviate poverty In addition to wage and salary income, investment income and government transfers such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps) and housing subsidies are included in a household's income. Studies measuring the differences between income before and after taxes and government transfers, have found that without social support programs, poverty would be roughly 30% to 40% higher than the official poverty line indicates.

Jealousy can consist of one or more emotions such as anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness or disgust. In its original meaning, jealousy is distinct from envy, though the two terms have popularly become synonymous in the English language, with jealousy now also taking on the definition originally used for envy alone. Jealousy is a typical experience in human relationships, and it has been observed in infants as young as five months.Draghi-Lorenz, R. (2000). Five- month-old infants can be jealous: Against cognitivist solipsism. Paper presented in a symposium convened for the XIIth Biennial International Conference on Infant Studies (ICIS), 16‚Äì19 July, Brighton, UK. Some researchers claim that jealousy is seen in all cultures and is a universal trait.Buss, D.M. (2000). The Dangerous Passion: Why Jealousy is as Necessary as Love and Sex. New York: Free Press.White, G.L., & Mullen, P.E. (1989). Jealousy: Theory, Research, and Clinical Practice. New York, NY: Guilford Press. However, others claim jealousy is a culture-specific emotion. Jealousy can either be suspicious or reactive,Rydell RJ, Bringle RG Differentiating reactive and suspicious jealousy Social Behavior and Personality An International Journal 35(8):1099-1114 Jan 2007 and it is often reinforced as a series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human experience. Psychologists have proposed several models to study the processes underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy. Sociologists have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. Biologists have identified factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy. Throughout history, artists have also explored the theme of jealousy in photographs, paintings, films, songs, plays, poems, and books, and theologians have offered religious views of jealousy based on the scriptures of their respective faiths.  Etymology  The word stems from the French jalousie, formed from jaloux (jealous), and further from Low Latin zelosus (full of zeal), in turn from the Greek word (zƒìlos), sometimes \\"jealousy\\", but more often in a positive sense \\"emulation, ardour, zeal\\"Jealous, Online Etymology DictionaryZelos, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, \\"A Greek-English Lexicon\\", at Perseus (with a root connoting \\"to boil, ferment\\"; or \\"yeast\\"). The \\"biblical language\\" zeal would be known as \\"tolerating no unfaithfulness\\" while in middle English zealous is good. One origin word gelus meant \\"Possessive and suspicious\\" the word then turned into jelus. Since William Shakespeare's use of terms like \\"green-eyed monster\\",Othello, Act III, Scene 3, 170 the color green has been associated with jealousy and envy, from which the expressions \\"green with envy\\", are derived.  Theories = Scientific definitions = Jealousy (1927), L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy People do not express jealousy through a single emotion or a single behavior.Darwin, C. (1872). The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals.Clanton, G. & Smith, L. (1977) Jealousy. New Jersey: Prentice- Hall, Inc.Bram Buunk, B. (1984). Jealousy as related to attributions for the partner's behavior. Social Psychology Quarterly, 47, 107‚Äì112. They instead express jealousy through diverse emotions and behaviors, which makes it difficult to form a scientific definition of jealousy. Scientists instead define jealousy in their own words, as illustrated by the following examples: > * \\"Romantic jealousy is here defined as a complex of thoughts, feelings, and > actions which follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence > or quality of the relationship, when those threats are generated by the > perception of potential attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps > imaginary) rival.\\" > * \\"Jealousy, then, is any aversive reaction that occurs as the result of a > partner's extradyadic relationship that is considered likely to > occur.\\"Bringle, R.G. & Buunk, B.P. (1991). Extradyadic relationships and > sexual jealousy. In K. McKinney and S.

First, all the definitions imply a triad composed of a jealous individual, a partner, and a perception of a third party or rival. Second, all the definitions describe jealousy as a reaction to a perceived threat to the relationship between two people, or a dyad. Jealous reactions typically involve aversive emotions and/or behaviors that are assumed to be protective for their attachment relationships. These themes form the essential meaning of jealousy in most scientific studies.  Comparison with envy  Popular culture uses the word jealousy as a synonym for envy. Many dictionary definitions include a reference to envy or envious feelings. In fact, the overlapping use of jealousy and envy has a long history. > The terms are used indiscriminately in such popular 'feelgood' books as > Nancy Friday's Jealousy, where the expression 'jealousy' applies to a broad > range of passions, from envy to lust and greed.

It is from this adjective > that are derived French jaloux, Proven√ßal gelos, Italian geloso, and Spanish > celoso.Lloyd, R. (1995). Closer & Closer Apart: Jealousy in Literature. > Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. Perhaps the overlapping use of jealousy and envy occurs because people can experience both at the same time. A person may envy the characteristics or possessions of someone who also happens to be a romantic rival. In fact, one may even interpret romantic jealousy as a form of envy.Kristjansson, K. (2002). Justifying Emotions: Pride and Jealousy. A jealous person may envy the affection that his or her partner gives to a rival ‚Äì affection the jealous person feels entitled to himself or herself. People often use the word jealousy as a broad label that applies to both experiences of jealousy and experiences of envy. Although popular culture often uses jealousy and envy as synonyms, modern philosophers and psychologists have argued for conceptual distinctions between jealousy and envy. For example, philosopher John RawlsRawls, J. (1971). A Theory of Justice. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. distinguishes between jealousy and envy on the ground that jealousy involves the wish to keep what one has, and envy the wish to get what one does not have. Thus, a child is jealous of her parents' attention to a sibling, but envious of her friend's new bicycle. Psychologists Laura Guerrero and Peter Andersen have proposed the same distinction.Guerrero, L.K., & Andersen, P.A. (1998). The dark side of jealousy and envy: desire, delusion, desperation, and destructive communication. In W.R. Cupach and B.H. Spitzberg (Eds.), The Dark Side of Close Relationships, (pp. ). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. They claim the jealous person \\"perceives that he or she possesses a valued relationship, but is in danger of losing it or at least of having it altered in an undesirable manner,\\" whereas the envious person \\"does not possess a valued commodity, but wishes to possess it.\\" Gerrod Parrott draws attention to the distinct thoughts and feelings that occur in jealousy and envy.Parrott, W.G. (1992). The emotional experiences of envy and jealousy. In P. Salovey (Ed.), The Psychology of Jealousy and Envy (pp. 3‚Äì29). New York, NY: The Guilford Press. The common experience of jealousy for many people may involve: :* Fear of loss :* Suspicion of or anger about a perceived betrayal :* Low self-esteem and sadness over perceived loss :* Uncertainty and loneliness :* Fear of losing an important person to another :* Distrust The experience of envy involves: :* Feelings of inferiority :* Longing :* Resentment of circumstances :* Ill will towards envied person often accompanied by guilt about these feelings :* Motivation to improve :* Desire to possess the attractive rival's qualities :* Disapproval of feelings :* Sadness towards other's accomplishments Parrott acknowledges that people can experience envy and jealousy at the same time. Feelings of envy about a rival can even intensify the experience of jealousy. Still, the differences between envy and jealousy in terms of thoughts and feelings justify their distinction in philosophy and science. = In psychology = Jealousy involves an entire \\"emotional episode,\\" including a complex \\"narrative\\": the circumstances that lead up to jealousy, jealousy itself as emotion, any attempt at self regulation, subsequent actions and events and the resolution of the episode. The narrative can originate from experienced facts, thoughts, perceptions, memories, but also imagination, guess and assumptions. The more society and culture matter in the formation of these factors, the more jealousy can have a social and cultural origin. By contrast, jealousy can be a \\"cognitively impenetrable state\\", where education and rational belief matter very little. One possible explanation of the origin of jealousy in evolutionary psychology is that the emotion evolved in order to maximize the success of our genes: it is a biologically based emotion selected to foster the certainty about the paternity of one's own offspring. A jealous behavior, in men, is directed into avoiding sexual betrayal and a consequent waste of resources and effort in taking care of someone else's offspring. There are, additionally, cultural or social explanations of the origin of jealousy. According to one, the narrative from which jealousy arises can be in great part made by the imagination. Imagination is strongly affected by a person's cultural milieu. The pattern of reasoning, the way one perceives situations, depends strongly on cultural context. It has elsewhere been suggested that jealousy is in fact a secondary emotion in reaction to one's needs not being met, be those needs for attachment, attention, reassurance or any other form of care that would be otherwise expected to arise from that primary romantic relationship. While mainstream psychology considers sexual arousal through jealousy a paraphilia, some authors on sexuality have argued that jealousy in manageable dimensions can have a definite positive effect on sexual function and sexual satisfaction. Studies have also shown that jealousy sometimes heightens passion towards partners and increases the intensity of passionate sex.Emotions and sexuality. In K. McKinney and S. Sprecher (Eds.), Sexuality, in close relationships (pp. 49‚Äì70). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.Pines, A. (1992). Romantic jealousy: Understanding and conquering the shadow of love. New York: St. Martin's Press. Jealousy in children and teenagers has been observed more often in those with low self-esteem and can evoke aggressive reactions. One such study suggested that developing intimate friends can be followed by emotional insecurity and loneliness in some children when those intimate friends interact with others. Jealousy is linked to aggression and low self-esteem. Research by Sybil Hart, PhD, at Texas Tech University indicates that children are capable of feeling and displaying jealousy at as young as six months. Infants showed signs of distress when their mothers focused their attention on a lifelike doll. This research could explain why children and infants show distress when a sibling is born, creating the foundation for sibling rivalry. In addition to traditional jealousy comes Obsessive Jealousy, which can be a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This jealousy is characterized by obsessional jealousy and thoughts of the partner. = In sociology = Anthropologists have claimed that jealousy varies across cultures. Cultural learning can influence the situations that trigger jealousy and the manner in which jealousy is expressed. Attitudes toward jealousy can also change within a culture over time. For example, attitudes toward jealousy changed substantially during the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. People in the United States adopted much more negative views about jealousy. As men and women became more equal it became less appropriate or acceptable to express jealousy.  Romantic jealousy  Romantic jealousy arises as a result of romantic interest. When the romantic advances of a young heterosexual male are always rejected and ignored by a lot of young women that he considers very attractive then the continued \\"rejection\\" or disinterest by those women can cause the male to feel jealousy and feelings of grief and might even trigger severe depression and in some cases, even the desire to end one's life. And throughout history, countless women and men have even ended their life because of countless romantic rejections. It is defined as ‚Äúa complex of thoughts, feelings, and actions that follow threats to self-esteem and/or threats to the existence or quality of the relationship when those threats are generated by the perception of a real or potential romantic attraction between one's partner and a (perhaps imaginary) rival.‚Äù Different from sexual jealousy, romantic jealousy is triggered by threats to self and relationship (rather than sexual interest in another person). Factors, such as feelings of inadequacy as a partner, sexual exclusivity, and having put relatively more effort into the relationship, are positively related to relationship jealousy in both genders. = Communicative responses = As romantic jealousy is a complicated reaction that has multiple components, i.e., thoughts, feelings, and actions, one aspect of romantic jealousy that is under study is communicative responses. Communicative responses serve three critical functions in a romantic relationship, i.e., reducing uncertainty, maintaining or repairing relationship, and restoring self-esteem. If done properly, communicative responses can lead to more satisfying relationships after experiencing romantic jealousy. There are two subsets of communicative responses: interactive responses and general behavior responses. Interactive responses is face-to-face and partner-directed while general behavior responses may not occur interactively. Guerrero and colleagues further categorize multiple types of communicative responses of romantic jealousy. Interactive responses can be broken down to six types falling in different places on continua of threat and directness: * Avoidance/Denial (low threat and low directness). Example: becoming silent; pretending nothing is wrong. * Integrative Communication (low threat and high directness). Example: explaining feelings; calmly questioning partner. * Active Distancing (medium threat and medium directness). Example: decreasing affection. * Negative Affect Expression (medium threat and medium directness). Example: venting frustration; crying or sulking. * Distributive Communication (high threat and high directness). Example: acting rude; making hurtful or abrasive comments. * Violent Communication/Threats (high threat and high directness). Example: using physical force. Guerrero and colleagues have also proposed five general behavior responses. The five sub-types differ in whether a response is 1) directed at partner or rival(s), 2) directed at discovery or repair, and 3) positively or negatively valenced: * Surveillance/ Restriction (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). Example: observing rival; trying to restrict contact with partner. * Rival Contacts (rival-targeted, discovery-oriented/repair-oriented, commonly negatively valenced). Example: confronting rival. * Manipulation Attempts (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, negatively valenced). Example: tricking partner to test loyalty; trying to make partner feel guilty. * Compensatory Restoration (partner-targeted, repair-oriented, commonly positively valenced). Example: sending flowers to partner. * Violent Behavior (-, -, negatively valenced). Example: slamming doors. While some of these communicative responses are destructive and aggressive, e.g., distributive communication and active distancing, some individuals respond to jealousy in a more constructive way. Integrative communication, compensatory restoration, and negative affect expression have been shown to lead to positive relation outcomes. One factor that affects the type of communicative responses elicited in an individual is emotions. Jealousy anger is associated with more aggressive communicative response while irritation tends to lead to more constructive communicative behaviors. Researchers also believe that when jealousy is experienced it can be caused by differences in understanding the commitment level of the couple, rather than directly being caused by biology alone. The research identified that if a person valued long-term relationships more than being sexually exclusive, those individuals were more likely to demonstrate jealousy over emotional rather than physical infidelity. Through a study conducted in three Spanish-Speaking countries, it was determined that Facebook jealousy also exists. This Facebook jealousy ultimately leads to increased relationship jealousy and study participants also displayed decreased self esteem as a result of the Facebook jealousy.  Sexual jealousy  Woman displaying jealousy while imagining her significant other with another woman Sexual jealousy may be triggered when a person's significant other displays sexual interest in another person. The feeling of jealousy may be just as powerful if one partner suspects the other is guilty of infidelity. Fearing that their partner will experience sexual jealousy the person who has been unfaithful may lie about their actions in order to protect their partner. Experts often believe that sexual jealousy is in fact a biological imperative. It may be part of a mechanism by which humans and other animals ensure access to the best reproductive partners. It seems that male jealousy in heterosexual relationships may be influenced by their female partner's phase in her menstrual cycle. In the period around and shortly before ovulation, males are found to display more mate-retention tactics, which are linked to jealousy. Furthermore, a male is more likely to employ mate-retention tactics if their partner shows more interest in other males, which is more likely to occur in the pre-ovulation phase.  Gender-based differences  According to the Parental Investment Model based on parental investment theory, more men than women ratify sex differences in jealousy. In addition, more women over men consider emotional infidelity (fear of abandonment) as more distressing than sexual infidelity. According to the attachment theory, sex and attachment style makes significant and unique interactive contributions to the distress experienced. Security within the relationship also heavily contributes to one's level of distress. These findings imply that psychological and cultural mechanisms regarding sex differences may play a larger role than expected. The attachment theory also claims to reveal how infants' attachment patterns are the basis for self-report measures of adult attachment. Although there are no sex differences in childhood attachment, individuals with dismissing behavior were more concerned with the sexual aspect of relationships. As a coping mechanism these individuals would report sexual infidelity as more harmful. Moreover, research shows that audit attachment styles strongly conclude with the type of infidelity that occurred. Thus psychological and cultural mechanisms are implied as unvarying differences in jealousy that play a role in sexual attachment.Rydell, McConnell, Bringle 2004, p. 10. Emotional jealousy was predicted to be nine times more responsive in females than in males. The emotional jealousy predicted in females also held turn to state that females experiencing emotional jealousy are more violent than men experiencing emotional jealousy. There are distinct emotional responses to gender differences in romantic relationships. For example, due to paternity uncertainty in males, jealousy increases in males over sexual infidelity rather than emotional. According to research more women are likely to be upset by signs of resource withdraw (i.e. another female) than by sexual infidelity. A large amount of data supports this notion. However, one must consider for jealousy the life stage or experience one encounters in reference to the diverse responses to infidelity available. Research states that a componential view of jealousy consist of specific set of emotions that serve the reproductive role. However, research shows that both men and women would be equally angry and point the blame for sexual infidelity, but women would be more hurt by emotional infidelity. Despite this fact, anger surfaces when both parties involved are responsible for some type of uncontrollable behavior, sexual conduct is not exempt. Some behavior and actions are controllable such as sexual behavior. However hurt feelings are activated by relationship deviation. No evidence is known to be sexually dimorphic in both college and adult convenience samples. The Jealousy Specific Innate Model (JSIM) proved to not be innate, but may be sensitive to situational factors. As a result, it may only activate at stages. One study discovered serious relationships are reserved for older adults rather than undergraduates. For example, it was predicted that male jealousy decreases as females reproductive values decreases. A second possibility that the JSIM effect is not innate but is cultural. Differences have been highlighted in socio-economic status specific such as the divide between high school and collegiate individuals. Moreover, individuals of both genders were angrier and blamed their partners more for sexual infidelities but were more hurt by emotional infidelity. Jealousy is composed of lower-level emotional states (e.g., anger and hurt) which may be triggered by a variety of events, not by differences in individuals' life stage. Although research has recognized the importance of early childhood experiences for the development of competence in intimate relationships, early family environment is recently being examined as we age). Research on self- esteem and attachment theory suggest that individuals internalize early experiences within the family which subconsciously translates into their personal view of worth of themselves and the value of being close to other individuals, especially in an interpersonal relationship.Green, Sabini 2006, p. 11  In animals  A study by researches at the University of California, San Diego, replicated jealousy studies done on humans on canines. They reported, in a paper published in PLOS ONE in 2014, that a significant number of dogs exhibited jealous behaviors when their human companions paid attention to dog-like toys, compared to when their human companions paid attention to nonsocial objects.  Applications = In fiction, film, and art = A painting by Miyagawa Issh≈ç shows a young onnagata catching his older lover with a love letter from a rival. Artistic depictions of jealousy occur in fiction, films, and other art forms such as painting and sculpture. Jealousy is a common theme in literature, art, theatre, and film. Often, it is presented as a demonstration of particularly deep feelings of love, rather than a destructive obsession. A study done by Ferris, Smith, Greenberg, and Smith looked into the way people saw dating and romantic relationships based on how many reality dating shows they watched. People who spent a large amount of time watching these reality dating shows \\"endorsed\\" or supported the \\"dating attitudes\\" that would be shown on the show. While the other people who do not spend time watching reality dating shows did not mirror the same ideas. This means if someone watches a reality dating show that displays men and women reacting violently or aggressively towards their partner due to jealousy they can mirror that. This is reflected in romantic movies as well. Jessica R. Frampton conducted a study looking into romantic jealousy in movies. The study found that there were \\"230 instances of romantic jealousy were identified in the 51 top-grossing romantic comedies from 2002‚Äì2014\\" Some of the films did not display romantic jealousy however, some featured many examples of romantic jealousy. This was due to the fact that some of the top-grossing movies did not contain a rival or romantic competition. While others such as Forgetting Sarah Marshal was said to contain \\"19 instances of romantic jealousy.\\" Out of the 230 instances 58% were reactive jealousy while 31% showed possessive jealousy. The last 11% displayed anxious jealousy it was seen the least in all 230 cases. Out of the 361 reactions to the jealousy found 53% were found to be \\"Destructive responses.\\" Only 19% of responses were constructive while 10% showed avoidant responses. The last 18% were considered \\"rival focused responses\\" which lead to the finding that \\"there was a higher than expected number of rival-focused responses to possessive jealousy.\\" = In religion = Jealousy in religion examines how the scriptures and teachings of various religions deal with the topic of jealousy. Religions may be compared and contrasted on how they deal with two issues: concepts of divine jealousy, and rules about the provocation and expression of human jealousy. = Cross Culture = A study was done in order to cross examine jealousy among four different cultures. The four cultures were chosen to try to reveal the difference in expression when moving from culture to culture. These four cultures were Ireland, Thailand, India and the United States. The overall findings discovered that in male dominate cultures are more likely to express and reveal jealousy than other cultures. This was proven when the survey found that Thais are less likely to express jealousy than the other three cultures. This is because the men in these cultures are rewarded in a way for showing jealousy due to the fact that some women interpret it as love. This can also be seen when watching romantic comedies when males show they are jealous of a rival or emotionally jealous women perceive it as men caring more.

Discovered by Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989, it is named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology. Proteus orbits Neptune in a nearly equatorial orbit at the distance of about 4.75 times the radius of Neptune's equator. Despite being a predominantly icy body more than in diameter, Proteus's shape deviates significantly from an ellipsoid. It is shaped more like an irregular polyhedron with several slightly concave facets and relief as high as . Its surface is dark, neutral in color, and heavily cratered. Proteus's largest crater is Pharos, which is more than in diameter. There are also a number of scarps, grooves, and valleys related to large craters. Proteus is probably not an original body that formed with Neptune. It could have accreted later from the debris formed when the largest Neptunian satellite Triton was captured.  Discovery and naming  Proteus was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 space probe two months before its Neptune flyby in August 1989. Proteus was the third moon of Neptune to be discovered, 33 years since the discovery of Neptune's moon Nereid in 1949. Upon discovery, Proteus received the temporary provisional designation S/1989 N 1. Stephen P. Synnott and Bradford A. Smith announced its discovery on July 7, 1989, speaking only of \\"17 frames taken over 21 days\\", which gives a discovery date of sometime before June 16. On 16 September 1991, S/1989 N 1 was named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology.  Orbit  Proteus orbits Neptune at a distance of approximately from Neptune, nearly equal to 4.75 times the equatorial radius of Neptune. The orbit of Proteus nearly circular, having a small orbital eccentricity, and is inclined by about 0.5 degrees to the Neptune's equator. Proteus is tidally locked to Neptune, and rotates synchronously with its orbital motion, which means that one side of Proteus always points to Neptune. Proteus may have once been in a 1:2 orbital resonance of Larissa, where Proteus makes one orbit for every two orbits made by Larissa. Due to the outward tidal migration of Proteus in the past, the orbital resonances of Proteus and Larissa are no longer in effect. Proteus may have ceased its integral orbital resonance with Larissa several hundred million years into the past.  Physical characteristics  Proteus is the second-largest moon of Neptune and is the largest of the regular prograde moons of Neptune. It is about in diameter, larger than Nereid, Neptune's third-largest moon. It was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes because Proteus orbits so close to Neptune that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight. = Composition = The surface of Proteus is dark as it has a geometrical albedo of about 10 percent‚Äìmeaning that its surface reflects 10 percent of the Sun's light. The probe was able to get photographs of Larissa, showing its cratered surface. The color of its surface is neutral as the reflectivity does not change appreciably with the wavelength from violet to green. In the near-infrared range of around the wavelength of 2 Œºm, Proteus's surface becomes less reflective, pointing to a possible presence of complex organic compounds such as hydrocarbons or cyanides. These compounds may be responsible for the low albedo of the inner Neptunian moons. Although Proteus is usually thought to contain significant amounts of water ice, it has not been detected spectroscopically on the surface. = Shape = The shape of Proteus is close to a sphere with a radius of about , although deviations from the spherical shape are large‚Äîup to ; scientists believe it is about as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a perfect spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has an ellipsoidal shape despite being slightly less massive than Proteus, perhaps due to the higher temperature near Saturn or tidal heating. Proteus is slightly elongated in the direction of Neptune, although its overall shape is closer to an irregular polyhedron than to a triaxial ellipsoid. The surface of Proteus shows several flat or slightly concave facets measuring from 150 to 200 km in diameter. They are probably degraded impact craters. = Surface features = digitally processed to show surface features. Map of Proteus from two sides. Proteus is heavily cratered, showing no sign of any geological modification. The largest crater, Pharos, has a diameter from . Its depth is about 10‚Äì15 km. The crater has a central dome on its floor a few kilometres high. Pharos is the only named surface feature on this moon: the name is Greek and refers to the island where Proteus reigned. In addition to Pharos there are several craters 50‚Äì100 km in diameter and many more with diameters less than 50 km. Other landforms on Proteus include linear features such as scarps, valleys, and grooves. The most prominent one runs parallel to the equator to the west of Pharos. These features likely formed as a result of the giant impacts, which formed Pharos and other large craters or as a result of tidal stresses from Neptune.  Origin  Proteus, like the other inner moons of Neptune, is unlikely to be an original body that formed with it, and is more likely to have accreted from the rubble that was produced after Triton's capture. Triton's orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian moons, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised did some of the rubble disc re-accrete into the present-day moons of Neptune. Proteus initially had a smaller orbit around Neptune, and may have formed closer to the planet. At the time of the formation of Proteus, its orbit was estimated to be less than its current distance from Neptune. Over time, Proteus migrated outward from Neptune through tidal interactions. During the outward migration of Proteus, collisions and impact events may have formed large craters and had ejected fragments of Proteus into orbit around Neptune. A collision of Proteus and another object could possibly explain the origin of Neptune's smaller moon Hippocamp, which orbits close to Proteus.

It was written and directed by Peter Jackson and Costa Botes, both of whom appear in the film in their roles as makers of the documentary. Synopsis Forgotten Silver purports to tell the story of \\"forgotten\\" New Zealand filmmaker Colin McKenzie, and the rediscovery of his lost films, which presenter Peter Jackson claims to have found in an old shed. McKenzie is presented as the first and greatest innovator of modern cinema, single-handedly inventing the tracking shot (by accident), the close-up (unintentionally), and both sound and color film years before their historically documented creation. The film also shows fragments of an epic Biblical film, Salome, supposedly made by McKenzie in a giant set in the forests of New Zealand, and a \\"computer enhancement\\" of a McKenzie film proving that New Zealander Richard Pearse was the first man to invent a powered aircraft, several months before the Wright Brothers.McKenzie (faked biography) The film also shows a (staged) premiere screening of a recovered McKenzie film presented by film promoter Lindsay Shelton. It features deadpan commentary from actor/director Sam Neill and director and film archivist John O'Shea, as well as critical praise from international industry notables including film historian Leonard Maltin, and Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films. In reality, McKenzie is a fictional character, and the films featured in Forgotten Silver were all created by Peter Jackson, carefully mimicking the style of early cinema. The interviewees are all acting. Thomas Robins, the actor who portrays Colin MacKenzie, is today more easily recognized by audiences as Sm√©agol's ill-fated cousin D√©agol in Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Cast As themselves: * Jeffrey Thomas (narrator) * Peter Jackson * Johnny Morris * Costa Botes * Harvey Weinstein * Leonard Maltin * Sam Neill * John O'Shea * Marguerite Hurst * Lindsay Shelton * Davina Whitehouse Actors: * Thomas Robins - Colin McKenzie * Richard Shirtcliffe - Brooke McKenzie * Beatrice Ashton - Hannah McKenzie * Peter Corrigan - Stan \\"the Man\\" Wilson * Sarah McLeod - May Belle  Production  Costa Botes directed the \\"documentary\\" portions while Peter Jackson created the \\"archive footage\\" supposedly filmed by McKenzie. Jackson also shot fake interviews in Los Angeles, including the one with Weinstein.  Reception  The film was first aired on Television New Zealand's channel TV ONE at a time usually dedicated to plays and mini-series, but was billed and introduced as a serious documentary. Many viewers were fooled until the directors shortly afterwards revealed that it was a hoax. This created controversy. Derived from The film was later screened at film festivals.

Barris was known for hosting The Gong Show and creating The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game. He was also a songwriter who wrote \\"Palisades Park\\" for Freddy Cannon. Barris wrote an autobiography titled Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, which was made into the film of the same name directed by George Clooney. Early life Barris was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 3, 1929, the son of Edith (n√©e Cohen) and Nathaniel Barris, a dentist. His uncle was singer, songwriter and actor Harry Barris. He graduated in 1953 from Drexel University where he was a columnist for the student newspaper, The Triangle. Career Barris got his start in television as a page and later staffer at NBC in New York City. Following his stint at NBC, Barris worked as a standards-and-practices person at the television music show American Bandstand for ABC. Barris produced pop music for records and television, and wrote \\"Palisades Park,‚Äù which was recorded by Freddy Cannon and peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks (June 23‚Äì30, 1962) to become the biggest hit of Cannon's career.Palisades Park ‚Äì Mr. Freddy \\"BOOM BOOM\\" Cannon , Epinions.com. Retrieved October 28, 2008. Barris also wrote or co-wrote some of the music that appeared on his game shows. Barris was promoted to the daytime programming division at ABC in Los Angeles and was responsible for determining which game shows ABC would air. Barris told his bosses the game show concepts being pitched were worse than his own ideas. They suggested that Barris quit his programming job and become a producer. Barris formed his production company Chuck Barris Productions on June 14, 1965. His first success came in 1965 with The Dating Game, which aired on ABC. This show was hosted by Jim Lange and featured three contestants who competed for a date with a person blocked from their view. The contestants' sexy banter and its \\"flower power\\"-motif studio set were a revolution for the game show genre. The show ran until 1980 and was twice revived, later in the 1980s and 1990s. The next year Barris began The Newlywed Game, originally created by Nick Nicholson and E. Roger Muir, also for ABC. The combination of the newlywed couples' humorous candor and host Bob Eubanks's sly questioning made the show another hit for Barris. The show is the longest lasting of any developed by his company, broadcast until 1985, for a total of 19 full years on both \\"first run\\" network TV and syndication. Game Show Network airs a current version with Sherri Shepherd. Interviewed on the NPR program Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me! on August 1, 2009, Barris said that The Newlywed Game was the easiest program he had developed: \\"All I needed was four couples, eight questions, and a washer- dryer.\\" Barris created several other short-lived game shows for ABC in the 1960s and for syndication in the 1970s, all of which revolved around a common theme: the game play normally derived its interest (and often, humor) from the excitement, vulnerability, embarrassment, or anger of the contestants or participants in the game. Barris also made several attempts through the years at non-game formats, such as ABC's Operation: Entertainment, a variety show staged at military bases akin to USO shows; a CBS revival of Your Hit Parade; and The Bobby Vinton Show, a Canadian-based syndicated variety show for singer Bobby Vinton (produced in conjunction with Chris Bearde and Allan Blye). The last was his most successful program other than a game show. =The Gong Show= The somewhat shy Barris rarely appeared on camera, though he once dashed onto the set of The New Treasure Hunt to throw a pie at emcee Geoff Edwards. However, Barris became a public figure in 1976 when he produced and served as the host of the talent show spoof The Gong Show, which he packaged in partnership with television producer Chris Bearde. The show's cult following has endured, though it ran only two seasons on NBC (1976‚Äì78) and four in syndication (1976‚Äì80). As with some of Barris' other projects (including The Newlywed Game), it was at one point possible to see The Gong Show twice daily, a relatively uncommon feat in the years prior to cable TV's expansion into the commercial market. The original host of the NBC show was John Barbour, who misunderstood the show's concept and considered it a straight talent show, as opposed to Barris' parody concept. Barris dropped Barbour at the last minute; in order to save the show, Barris followed the advice of an NBC executive who suggested that he should host his own show. Barris' jokey, bumbling personality; his accentuated hand-clapping between sentences (which eventually had the studio audience joining in with him); and his catchphrases (he would usually go into commercial break with, \\"We'll be right back with more er ... STUFF ...\\", occasionally paired with shifting his head to reveal the ubiquitous sign behind the stage reading simply \\"STUFF\\", and \\"This is me saying 'bye'\\" was one of his favorite closing lines) were the antithesis of the smooth TV host (such as Gary Owens, who hosted the syndicated version in its first season). Barris joined in with the eccentricity of the format, using unusual props, dressing in colorful and somewhat unusual clothing (such as strange hats pulled over his head, if not his eyes), he became yet another performer of the show, and for many viewers, quite a cult hero. Dubbed \\"Chuckie Baby\\" by his fans, Barris was a perfect fit with the show's goofy, sometimes wild amateur performers and its panel of three judges (including regulars Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, and Arte Johnson). In addition, there was a growing \\"cast of characters\\", including an NBC stage carpenter who played \\"Father Ed,\\" a priest who would get flustered when his cue cards were deliberately turned upside-down; stand-up comedian Murray Langston, who as \\"The Unknown Comic\\" wore a paper bag over his head (with cut-outs for his eyes, mouth, and even a box of Kleenex), and \\"Gene Gene the Dancing Machine\\" (Gene Patton), arguably the most popular member of the \\"cast\\", the show's stagehand, who would show up and dance whenever the band played the song \\"Jumpin' at the Woodside\\". In the early 1980s, Patton was even pointed out by tour guides of incoming NBC tours as his onscreen character, while at the same time adhering to his more typical off-camera work duties. One Gong Show episode consisted of every act appearing singing the song \\"Feelings\\", which was popular at the time. One of its most infamous incidents came on the NBC version in 1978, when Barris presented an onstage act consisting of two teenage girls, slowly and suggestively sucking popsicles. Another incident, which most missed originally, was when during a \\"Gene Gene, The Dancing Machine\\" segment, Jaye P. Morgan opened her blouse to reveal her bare breasts. In 1980, Barris starred in and directed The Gong Show Movie. The film was a major failure at the box office. Its storyline and approach, though including a number of Gong Show segments, was actually quite less \\"zany\\" (another favorite Barris phrase) than most audiences may have expected. The Gong Show has had four subsequent revivals, one under Barris' title (with Don Bleu) in 1988‚Äì89, one on The Game Show Network in 2000 called Extreme Gong and another with current format owner Sony Pictures Television (with Dave Attell) in 2008. A fourth version, produced by Will Arnett and hosted by fictional British celebrity \\"Tommy Maitland\\" (Mike Myers), aired on ABC beginning in 2017. =Comebacks and setbacks= Barris continued strongly until the mid-1970s, when ABC cancelled the Dating and Newlywed games. This left Barris with only one show, his weekly syndicated effort The New Treasure Hunt. But the success of The Gong Show in 1976 encouraged him to revive the Dating and Newlywed games, as well as adding the $1.98 Beauty Show to his syndication empire. He also hosted a short lived primetime variety hour for NBC from February to April 1978, called The Chuck Barris Rah-Rah Show, essentially a non-competitive knock-off of Gong. The empire crumbled again amid the burnout of another of his creations, the 1979‚Äì80 Three's a Crowd (in which three sets of wives and secretaries competed to see who knew more about their husbands/bosses). This show provoked protests from enraged feminist and socially conservative groups (two otherwise diametrically opposed viewpoints), who charged that the show deliberately exploited adultery, to advocate it as a social norm. Most stations dropped this show months before the season was over as a response to those criticisms. At the same time, Newlywed lost the sponsorships of Ford and Procter & Gamble and earned the resentment of Jackie Autry, whose husband and business partner Gene Autry owned the show's Los Angeles outlet and production base, KTLA, because of its supposedly highly prurient content. So strong were the feelings of the Autrys that Newlywed came close to being expelled from the KTLA facilities, but the show was discontinued by the syndicator before any action occurred. Gong Show and Dating Game also ended otherwise successful syndicated runs in 1980 because of the Three's a Crowd and Newlywed controversies, likely because stations were fearful of community and advertiser retribution on account of Barris' reputation. During the winter of 1980, Barris attempted to rebuild by bringing back another game show that was not an original of his, Camouflage, in which contestants answered questions for the chance to locate a \\"hidden object\\" (such as a toaster) concealed within a cartoon-type drawing. Although a noncontroversial format, it lasted only a short time in syndication. By September 1980, for the first time in his company's history, Barris had no shows in production. After a year's inactivity, Barris revived Treasure Hunt again in 1981 in partnership with the original 1950s version's producer, Budd Granoff, who had become his business partner (the show itself was created by its original host, Jan Murray). Unlike with the 1970s version of Treasure Hunt, Barris did not have direct involvement with the production of the show itself. This revival, a five-day-a-week strip, lasted only one year. Barris, by this time living in France, came back again in 1984 and formed Barris Industries. He formed a distributor arm called Bel-Air Program Sales (later Barris Program Sales) and an ad-sales barter called Clarion Communications (later Barris Advertising Sales). After a week-long trial of The Newlywed Game on ABC in 1984 (with Dating Game emcee Jim Lange), Barris produced the daily Newlywed Game (titled The New Newlywed Game) in syndication from 1985 to 1989, with original host Eubanks (and in 1988, comedian Paul Rodriguez). The Dating Game returned to syndication the next year for a three-year run (the first year hosted by Elaine Joyce, and the next two hosted by Jeff MacGregor). The Gong Show would also return for one season in 1988, now hosted by \\"True\\" Don Bleu. All of those shows (except for the one-week trial run of Newlywed on ABC) aired in syndication, not on the networks. Chuck Barris sold his shares of Barris Industries, Inc. in 1987 to Burt Sugarman and left to move back to France and was no longer directly involved in his media company. In 1988, Barris Industries acquired the Guber-Peters Company. On September 7, 1989, Barris Industries was renamed as the Guber-Peters Entertainment Company.Barris Industries Has New Name. After the shows' runs ended, Sony Corporation acquired Guber-Peters Entertainment (formerly Barris Industries) for $200 million on September 29, 1989, a day after Sony Corporation of Japan acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment. The sale was completed on November 9, 1989 after Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment a day earlier. Sony revived Dating and Newlywed from 1996 to 1999. Sony also revived The Gong Show in 1998, this time as Extreme Gong, a Game Show Network (GSN) original production. Three's a Crowd would be revived as All New Three's a Crowd, which, like Extreme Gong, was a GSN original. A few years after Extreme Gong ended, Sony planned to revive the show again under its classic name and format for The WB Television Network, but this version was never realized. Sony and MTV Networks' Comedy Central collaborated on a fourth Gong Show revival as The Gong Show with Dave Attell in 2008; this did sell and aired on Comedy Central from July to September 2008. One more attempt at reviving an old game show that was not his own originally resulted in an unsold pilot of the 1950s-era game Dollar a Second, hosted by Bob Eubanks. It had at least one showing on GSN, and has since become part of the collector/trader's circuit. Two more unsold pilots were called Bamboozle and Comedy Courtroom. Barris published Della: A Memoir of My Daughter in 2010 about the death of his only child, who died in 1998 after a long struggle with drug addiction. CIA career claims In 1984 Barris wrote an autobiography, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. In the book he states that he worked for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as an assassin in the 1960s and the 1970s. A 2002 feature film version, directed by George Clooney and starring Sam Rockwell, depicts Barris killing 33 people. Barris wrote a sequel to Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in 2004 called Bad Grass Never Dies. The CIA denied Barris ever worked for them in any capacity. After the release of the movie, CIA spokesman Paul Nowack said Barris' assertions that he worked for the spy agency ‚Äú[are] ridiculous. It's absolutely not true.\\"Stein, Joel (January 13, 2003). \\"Lying to Tell the Truth\\". Time. Accessed September 2, 2008. Barris himself refused to confirm or deny his account, and did not deny the authenticity of the book. In an interview in 2010 with the Television Academy Foundation, he was asked if he had ever disclosed the truth to anyone, including his wife. \\"No, never,\\" Barris said. \\"I'll never say, one way or the other.\\" \\"Was Chuck Barris a CIA Assassin? \\"There's a Possibility,\\" 'Dangerous Mind' Producer Says\\".

Personal life and death Barris at Drexel University in 2010 Barris' first wife was Lyn Levy, the niece of one of the founders of CBS. Their marriage lasted from 1957 to 1976, ending in divorce. Together they had a daughter, Della, who frequently appeared on The Gong Show, usually introducing her father. Della died of an alcohol and cocaine overdose in 1998 at the age of 36.https://www.today.com/popculture/barris-excess-killed-my- daughter-2D80556363 At the time of her death, she was also HIV positive. In 1980, Barris married Robin Altman, 23 years his junior. That marriage also ended in divorce, in 1999. The following year, he married Mary Clagett. Barris was diagnosed with lung cancer in the 1990s. After undergoing surgery to remove part of his lung, he contracted an infection and spent a month in intensive care. Barris died on March 21, 2017, of natural causes at the age of 87 at his home in Palisades, New York, where he lived with Clagett.

Stage management may encompass a variety of activities including the overseeing of the rehearsal process and coordinating communications among various production teams and personnel. Stage management requires a general understanding of all aspects of production and offers organisational support to ensure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. A stage manager is an individual who has overall responsibility for stage management and the smooth execution of a theatrical production. Stage management may be performed by an individual in small productions, while larger productions typically employ a stage management team consisting of a head stage manager, or production stage manager, and one or more assistant stage managers. History The title of stage manager was not used until the 18th century, though the concept and need for someone to fill the area of stage management can be seen with the Ancient Greeks. The playwrights were usually responsible for production elements. Sophocles is the first known stage technician, supported by his employment as a scenic artist, playwright, musician, and producer. In the Middle Ages, there is evidence of a conducteur de secrets, who oversaw collecting money at the door and serving as a prompter on stage. The prompter held the script and was prepared to feed performers their lines; this was a common practice of the time. Between the Renaissance and 17th century, the actors and playwright handled stage management aspects and stage crew. In the Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre there were two roles that covered the stage management: stage keeper and book keeper. The stage keeper was responsible for the maintenance of the theater, taking props on and off stage, and security of performance space. The book keeper was responsible for the stage script, obtaining necessary licenses, copying/providing lines for the performers, marking entrances and exits, tracking props, marking when sound effects come in, and cueing props and sound effects. Between the Renaissance and the 16th century, actors and playwrights took upon themselves the handling of finances, general directorial duties, and stage management. Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Moli√®re's time. During Shakespeare‚Äôs time the roles of stage management were left to apprentices, young boys learning the trade. There is still evidence of a prompter at this time. It was not until the 18th century in England that the term stage manager was used. This was the first time a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage the stage. Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, the stage manager's job was split into two positions‚Äîdirector and stage manager. Many playwrights, directors, and actors have previously worked as an assistant stage manager. Writer and director Preston Sturges, for example, was employed as an ASM on Isadora Duncan's production of Oedipus Rex at the age of 16 and a half: > When one is responsible for giving an offstage cue, even the simplest ones, > like the ring of a telephone or a birdcall, demand considerable sangfroid, > and the job is nervewracking. One is very much aware that everything depends > on the delivery of the cue at exactly the right microsecond. One stands > there, knees slightly bent, breathing heavily..., p. 123-24 Sturges didn't last long in this job, due to his calling for thunder and then lightning instead of lightning and then thunder, but 16 years later Brock Pemberton hired him as an ASM on Antoinette Perry's production of Goin' Home, which led to the first mounting of one of Sturges' plays on Broadway, The Guinea Pig, in 1929. pp. 239-245  Responsibilities  Page from American actress Charlotte Cushman's prompt-book for Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Washington Theater in 1861 * Pre-rehearsal preparation: ** Create a contact sheet with information on everyone in the production ** Collect all conflicts to create a rehearsal schedule ** Send out the rehearsal schedule to the actors and creative team ** Knowing the rehearsal and stage layout ** Understanding the ground plan of the set ** Acquire all rehearsal props that are needed in rehearsals * First rehearsal ** Have the actors fill out emergency contact forms and other information needed by the production team ** Assigning scripts to everyone in the production ** Make detailed notes on the blocking of the production ** Make sure the production team members who need to explain the set, actors equity association reps, costumes, directors concept, and more ** First read-through of show SM reads the stage directions ** Responsible for the well-being and safety of everyone and should have basic first aid kit at all rehearsals * Rehearsal period ** Responsible for any questions or changes the director thinks of during rehearsal to bring up during production meetings ** SM‚Äôs are responsible for following along in the script, prompting when actors forget their lines and taking line notes ** Monitor time to make sure company get their breaks at specific intervals (more important when working in Equity) ** Noting any changes or edits to the script ** Responsible for creating the running script that includes tech cues that are used by the SM ** Writing daily rehearsal reports that detail what happened in rehearsal that day and what notes, if any, the SM/director have for the production team. Then distribute it to all production team members. ** Collecting the bios for the actors and production team for the show‚Äôs programs ** Responsible for contacting anyone who is running late to rehearsal without notifying the SM ** Most rehearsals are closed, meaning no one outside of the production is welcome, and it is the SM‚Äôs job to enforce this ** Creating a callboard for the actors to sign in during tech rehearsals and performance ** Creating cue sheets for everyone taking cues from the SM during the show (sound usually makes it own separate cue sheets, for which the SM is not responsible) ** Running tech rehearsals with other aspects of the production team (lights, sound, set, costumes, etc) * Design meetings ** Not always present but all decisions made need to be communicated to SM to ensure all production team are informed of what happened during the meetings * Production meetings ** Responsible for running the meeting ** Maintaining a healthy environment for communication ** Documenting all discussions and decisions ** Ensuring attendance of all production team ** Ensuring the meeting accomplishes everything on the docket within the allotted amount of time ** Sending the production meeting report forms that detail discussions and decisions made to production team members * Performance ** Responsible for making sure actors are on time to rehearsal and contacting them if they are running late ** Working with house managers to deal with unexpected events (tornadoes, delays, technical difficulties) ** Knowing state laws and responsibilities during emergencies ** Responsible for creating a performance log for each show that details any technical, artistic, or temperament problems that arose during the run * Strike ** Making sure all production members attend strike ** Making sure all rented or borrowed material is separated from the rest of the set and returned to its lender ** Knowing what set pieces, props, and costumes will be saved and which will be destroyed, and making sure the correct pieces are saved and destroyed  Tools = Stage management kit = The stage management kit can be as expansive as a huge tackle box, or a smaller bag containing only the absolute essentials. Some common items in a kit include: * First aid kit/hygiene supplies ** Band-aids ** EpiPen or sugar pen ** Pain medication such as Ibuprofen or Tylenol ** Tweezers ** Ace bandages ** Antibiotic ointment ** Nail clippers/file ** Mints ** Eye drops ** Lozenges ** Lip balm ** Ice packs ** Hand sanitizer ** Tampons/pads ** Gauze ** Hair elastics and/or clips ** Bobby pins ** Tissues * Flashlight(s) * Batteries * Variety of tape ** Gaff ** Spike ** Glow ** Masking ** Color-blocking ** Reflective * Tools ** Wrench ** Screwdriver ** Power drill (and charger) ** Staple remover ** Pocketknife * Emergency sewing kit ** Mini-scissors ** Safety pins ** Needle and thread ** Extra notions like: *** Zippers *** Buttons *** Snaps *** Hooks and eyes ** Hemming tape ** Tide or stain-removal pen = Rehearsal room kit = Other items may be needed specifically during the rehearsal period, such as: * Laptop for note-taking and rehearsal reports * Pens, pencils, and highlighters * Sticky notes for line notes or other notes in the script = Means of communication = It is important to keep lines of communication open between the stage manager and all other departments of the production. * Technology ** Phones *** Actors' Equity requires a dedicated line in a production office, but most people in a cast and crew will have personal cell phones available. ** Texting/calling *** The stage manager may need to text or call actors or crew members to give them reminders or check up on them if they are late for a call time. ** Email *** Email can be useful for communication between production departments, sending reminders to cast and crew, or distribution of rehearsal reports and other materials. **** The SM might utilize a feedback loop - ask the recipients to reply to show they have received and understand the information. ***** \\"Communication without feedback isn't communication, it's broadcasting.\\" - Ed Baker ** Headset/walkie talkies *** During tech, dress rehearsals, and the run of the show, the stage manager may need to be on headset to call cues and communicate with lights, sound, and any assistant stage managers ** Call board *** The call board might be an actual bulletin board backstage, or an electronic message board. Usually the sign-in sheet for actors and crew will be located on the call board. = Prompt book = The prompt book contains the script from which the SM calls the show, labeled with light and sound cues. It may also contain: * Shift plot for props * A pre-show schedule * A pre-show checklist * Light and sound cue breakdowns * Rehearsal schedules * Rehearsal and performance reports * Confidential emergency health history * Cast and crew contact sheet * Directors notes * Blocking notes * Scene changes  Regional differences = United States = In the United States, stage manager is a generic title that may be applied to anyone who performs stage management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of stage management, and is simply referred to as the stage manager. Larger shows often need two or more stage managers. In such cases the head stage manager is titled production stage manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more assistant stage managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three stage managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as production stage manager (first or head stage manager), stage manager (second stage manager), and assistant stage manager (third stage manager). Some professional stage managers on plays and musicals may choose to be represented by a union known as the Actors' Equity Association, which also represents performers. In addition to performing their typical stage management duties (e.g., maintaining the prompt book and calling performances), Equity stage managers are also required to uphold the union's rules and rights for Equity artists. Union stage managers for opera, ballet, and modern dance are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists and perform most of the same duties as their counterparts in plays and musicals. The American Guild of Variety Artists also represents variety performers, dancers and stage managers. =United Kingdom= In the UK, the structure of a stage management team depends on the type and size of the production. It can consist of stage manager (overseeing the running of the show), deputy stage manager (commonly called DSM), and assistant stage manager (commonly called ASM). A fringe theatre show may employ one stage manager to carry out the tasks of an entire team, whereas a West End theatre show in London might employ multiple ASMs. Professional stage managers are represented by the British Actors' Equity Association, which also represents performers. Deputy stage manager The DSM prompts actors and will usually cue technical crew members and sometimes cast, while following the orders of the director and stage manager. The DSM calls actors to hold while technical problems are sorted out during rehearsal, and determines where in the script to restart halted scenes.Pallin, p. 81 The deputy stage manager (DSM) is a separate position in some theatres, while in others the responsibilities of the DSM may be assumed by the stage manager or assistant stage manager.Bond, p. 15 Assistant stage manager The assistant stage manager (ASM) has varied responsibilities, which are assigned by the stage manager. The ASM assists in finding and maintaining props during rehearsals and the run of the show. The ASM may take attendance or estimate audience size, may manage the backstage technicians, may act as a liaison between crew, cast and management, and may call some cues. Mundane tasks such as mopping the stage and brewing coffee or tea may fall to the ASM. If the stage manager is unable to perform his or her duties, the ASM must be able to fill in.Bond, pp. 15‚Äì16 The assistant may also be in charge of one wing of the stage, while the stage manager is on the other wing. Show control based venues Many live shows around the world are produced with the foreknowledge that they will have a very long run, often measured in years. These are usually known quantities that are very expensive productions and have a guaranteed audience because of their location. They may be on cruise ships, in theme parks, Las Vegas or at destination resorts. These shows warrant very long-range development and planning and use stage managers to run almost all technical elements in the show, without many of the other traditional crew members, such as sound, lighting and rigging operators. In these cases, show control systems are installed and connected to all other technical systems in the theatre, which are specifically designed to be controlled by show control and to operate safely with minimal supervision. Stage managers working these shows usually have the additional responsibility for programming the show control system, and often the other control systems as well.  Different areas of stage management  The role of stage manager evolved from an amalgamation of various positions in theater over several centuries and is still generally known for its integral relationship with theater. Many other types of productions and events have incorporated the position of stage management, however. Some of the most common are opera, music and dance concerts, film and television. For music concerts, stage management includes a large variety of responsibilities depending on both the venue and the size and expertise of the musical group coming into the venue. Some of the responsibilities of a concert stage manager include overseeing the schedule for load in and out of equipment, seeing to the comfort of the group which can include arranging refreshments and or transportation, sometimes arranging how and where merchandise is to be sold at the venue, and above all, as with all areas of stage management, watching out for the safety of all participants in the experience including performers, audience, and any crews required.  Stage managers and unions  A stage manager needs to know what unions they will be working with, how often they take breaks, and who is represented by which union. = Actors Equity Association = Commonly referred to as Actors Equity (AEA). Actors Equity represents the stage actors and stage managers in the live theatre industry. The AEA works to negotiate and provide performers and stage managers quality living conditions, livable wages, and benefits. = IATSE = International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) represents stagehands in the theatre. = United Scenic Artists = United Scenic Artists is also known as United Scenic Artists of America. It organizes designers, artists and craftspeople in the entertainment and decorative arts industries. United Scenic Artists has been affiliated with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees since 1999.

Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in American EnglishSee entry on \\"dialogue (n)\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. Etymology Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, 1632 John Kerry listens to a Question of reporter Matt Lee, after giving remarks on World Press Freedom Day (3rd May 2016) The term dialogue stems from the Greek Œ¥ŒπŒ¨ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøœÇ (dialogos, conversation); its roots are Œ¥ŒπŒ¨ (dia: through) and ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ (logos: speech, reason). The first extant author who uses the term is Plato, in whose works it is closely associated with the art of dialectic. Latin took over the word as dialogus.\\"Dialogue\\", Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition As genre Republic =Antiquity and the Middle Ages= Dialogue as a genre in the Middle East and Asia dates back to ancient works, such as Sumerian disputations preserved in copies from the late third millennium BC,G.

Leuven: Department Ori√´ntalistiek. Rigvedic dialogue hymns and the Mahabharata. In the East, In 13th century Japan, dialogue was used in important philosophical works. In the 1200s, Nichiren Daishonin wrote some of his important writings in dialogue form, describing a meeting between two characters in order to present his argument and theory, such as in \\"Conversation between a Sage and an Unenlightened Man\\" (The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin 1: pp.99-140, dated around 1256), and \\"On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land\\" (Ibid., pp.6-30; dated 1260), while in other writings he used a question and answer format, without the narrative scenario, such as in \\"Questions and Answers about Embracing the Lotus Sutra\\" (Ibid., pp.55-67, possibly from 1263). The sage or person answering the questions was understood as the author. In the West, Plato (c. 437 BC ‚Äì c. 347 BC) has commonly been credited with the systematic use of dialogue as an independent literary form. Ancient sources indicate, however, that the Platonic dialogue had its foundations in the mime, which the Sicilian poets Sophron and Epicharmus had cultivated half a century earlier. These works, admired and imitated by Plato, have not survived and we have only the vaguest idea of how they may have been performed. The Mimes of Herodas, which were found in a papyrus in 1891, give some idea of their character. Plato further simplified the form and reduced it to pure argumentative conversation, while leaving intact the amusing element of character-drawing. By about 400 BC he had perfected the Socratic dialogue. All his extant writings, except the Apology and Epistles, use this form. Following Plato, the dialogue became a major literary genre in antiquity, and several important works both in Latin and in Greek were written. Soon after Plato, Xenophon wrote his own Symposium; also, Aristotle is said to have written several philosophical dialogues in Plato's style (of which only fragments survive). =Modern period to the present= Two French writers of eminence borrowed the title of Lucian's most famous collection; both Fontenelle (1683) and F√©nelon (1712) prepared Dialogues des morts (\\"Dialogues of the Dead\\"). Contemporaneously, in 1688, the French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche published his Dialogues on Metaphysics and Religion, thus contributing to the genre's revival in philosophic circles. In English non-dramatic literature the dialogue did not see extensive use until Berkeley employed it, in 1713, for his treatise, Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous. His contemporary, the Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. A prominent 19th-century example of literary dialogue was Landor's Imaginary Conversations (1821‚Äì1828). In Germany, Wieland adopted this form for several important satirical works published between 1780 and 1799. In Spanish literature, the Dialogues of Vald√©s (1528) and those on Painting (1633) by Vincenzo Carducci are celebrated. Italian writers of collections of dialogues, following Plato's model, include Torquato Tasso (1586), Galileo (1632), Galiani (1770), Leopardi (1825), and a host of others. In the 19th century, the French returned to the original application of dialogue. The inventions of \\"Gyp\\", of Henri Lavedan, and of others, which tell a mundane anecdote wittily and maliciously in conversation, would probably present a close analogy to the lost mimes of the early Sicilian poets. English writers including Anstey Guthrie also adopted the form, but these dialogues seem to have found less of a popular following among the English than their counterparts written by French authors. The Platonic dialogue, as a distinct genre which features Socrates as a speaker and one or more interlocutors discussing some philosophical question, experienced something of a rebirth in the 20th century. Authors who have recently employed it include George Santayana, in his eminent Dialogues in Limbo (1926, 2nd ed. 1948; this work also includes such historical figures as Alcibiades, Aristippus, Avicenna, Democritus, and Dionysius the Younger as speakers). Also Edith Stein and Iris Murdoch used the dialogue form. Stein imagined a dialogue between Edmund Husserl (phenomenologist) and Thomas Aquinas (metaphysical realist). Murdoch included not only Socrates and Alcibiades as interlocutors in her work Acastos: Two Platonic Dialogues (1986), but featured a young Plato himself as well. More recently Timothy Williamson wrote Tetralogue, a philosophical exchange on a train between four people with radically different epistemological views. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have proposed a holistic concept of dialogue. Educators such as Freire and Ram√≥n Flecha have also developed a body of theory and techniques for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool. As topic David Bohm, a leading 20th-century thinker on dialogue. Martin Buber assigns dialogue a pivotal position in his theology. His most influential work is titled I and Thou. Buber cherishes and promotes dialogue not as some purposive attempt to reach conclusions or express mere points of view, but as the very prerequisite of authentic relationship between man and man, and between man and God. Buber's thought centers on \\"true dialogue\\", which is characterized by openness, honesty, and mutual commitment. The Second Vatican Council placed a major emphasis on dialogue with the World. Most of the Council's documents involve some kind of dialogue : dialogue with other religions (Nostra aetate), dialogue with other Christians (Unitatis Redintegratio), dialogue with modern society (Gaudium et spes) and dialogue with political authorities (Dignitatis Humanae). However, in the English translations of these texts, \\"dialogue\\" was used to translate two Latin words with distinct meanings, colloquium (\\"discussion\\") and dialogus (\\"dialogue\\"). The choice of terminology appears to have been strongly influenced by Buber's thought. The physicist David Bohm originated a related form of dialogue where a group of people talk together in order to explore their assumptions of thinking, meaning, communication, and social effects. This group consists of ten to thirty people who meet for a few hours regularly or a few continuous days. In a Bohm dialogue, dialoguers agree to leave behind debate tactics that attempt to convince and, instead, talk from their own experience on subjects that are improvised on the spot. In his influential works, Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin provided an extralinguistic methodology for analysing the nature and meaning of dialogue:Maranh√£o 1990, p.51 > Dialogic relations have a specific nature: they can be reduced neither to > the purely logical (even if dialectical) nor to the purely linguistic > (compositional-syntactic) They are possible only between complete utterances > of various speaking subjects... Where there is no word and no language, > there can be no dialogic relations; they cannot exist among objects or > logical quantities (concepts, judgments, and so forth). Dialogic relations > presuppose a language, but they do not reside within the system of language. > They are impossible among elements of a language.Bakhtin 1986, p.117 The Brazilian educationalist Paulo Freire, known for developing popular education, advanced dialogue as a type of pedagogy. Freire held that dialogued communication allowed students and teachers to learn from one another in an environment characterized by respect and equality. A great advocate for oppressed peoples, Freire was concerned with praxis‚Äîaction that is informed and linked to people's values. Dialogued pedagogy was not only about deepening understanding; it was also about making positive changes in the world: to make it better. As practice A classroom dialogue at Shimer College. Dialogue is used as a practice in a variety of settings, from education to business. Influential theorists of dialogal education include Paulo Freire and Ramon Flecha. In the United States, an early form of dialogic learning emerged in the Great Books movement of the early to mid-20th century, which emphasized egalitarian dialogues in small classes as a way of understanding the foundational texts of the Western canon. Institutions that continue to follow a version of this model include the Great Books Foundation, Shimer College in Chicago, and St. John's College in Annapolis and Santa Fe. =Egalitarian dialogue= Egalitarian dialogue is a concept in dialogic learning. It may be defined as a dialogue in which contributions are considered according to the validity of their reasoning, instead of according to the status or position of power of those who make them. =Structured dialogue= Structured dialogue represents a class of dialogue practices developed as a means of orienting the dialogic discourse toward problem understanding and consensual action. Whereas most traditional dialogue practices are unstructured or semi-structured, such conversational modes have been observed as insufficient for the coordination of multiple perspectives in a problem area. A disciplined form of dialogue, where participants agree to follow a dialogue framework or a facilitator, enables groups to address complex shared problems. Aleco Christakis (who created structured dialogue design) and John N. Warfield (who created science of generic design) were two of the leading developers of this school of dialogue. The rationale for engaging structured dialogue follows the observation that a rigorous bottom-up democratic form of dialogue must be structured to ensure that a sufficient variety of stakeholders represents the problem system of concern, and that their voices and contributions are equally balanced in the dialogic process. Structured dialogue is employed for complex problems including peacemaking (e.g., Civil Society Dialogue project in Cyprus) and indigenous community development., as well as government and social policy formulation. In one deployment, structured dialogue is (according to a European Union definition) \\"a means of mutual communication between governments and administrations including EU institutions and young people. The aim is to get young people's contribution towards the formulation of policies relevant to young peoples lives.\\"Definition of structured dialogue focused on youth matters The application of structured dialogue requires one to differentiate the meanings of discussion and deliberation. Groups such as Worldwide Marriage Encounter and Retrouvaille use dialogue as a communication tool for married couples. Both groups teach a dialogue method that helps couples learn more about each other in non-threatening postures, which helps to foster growth in the married relationship. =Dialogical leadership= The German philosopher and classicist Karl-Martin Dietz emphasizes the original meaning of dialogue (from Greek dia-logos, i.e. 'two words'), which goes back to Heraclitus: \\"The logos [...] answers to the question of the world as a whole and how everything in it is connected. Logos is the one principle at work, that gives order to the manifold in the world.\\"Karl-Martin Dietz: Acting Independently for the Good of the Whole. From Dialogical Leadership to a Dialogical Corporate Culture. Heidelberg: Menon 2013. p. 10. For Dietz, dialogue means \\"a kind of thinking, acting and speaking, which the logos \\"passes through\\"\\"Dietz: Acting Independently for the Good of the Whole. p. 10. Therefore, talking to each other is merely one part of \\"dialogue\\". Acting dialogically means directing someone's attention to another one and to reality at the same time.Karl-Martin Dietz: Dialog die Kunst der Zusammenarbeit. 4. Auflage. Heidelberg 2014. p. 7. Against this background and together with Thomas Kracht, Karl-Martin Dietz developed what he termed \\"dialogical leadership\\" as a form of organizational management.Karl-Martin Dietz, Thomas Kracht: Dialogische F√ºhrung. Grundlagen - Praxis Fallbeispiel: dm-drogerie markt. 3. Auflage. Frankfurt am Main: Campus 2011. In several German enterprises and organisations it replaced the traditional human resource management, e.g. in the German drugstore chain dm-drogerie markt. Separately, and earlier to Thomas Kracht and Karl-Martin Dietz, Rens van Loon published multiple works on the concept of dialogical leadership, starting with a chapter in the 2003 book The Organization as Story.https://books.google.nl/books?id=yHA8etYwBLwC&lpg;=PA109&ots;=1r56caF9Bk&dq;=Dialogical%20Leadership%20van%20Loon&pg;=PA109#v=onepage&q;=Dialogical%20Leadership%20van%20Loon&f;=false =Moral dialogues= Moral dialogues are social processes which allow societies or communities to form new shared moral understandings. Moral dialogues have the capacity to modify the moral positions of a sufficient number of people to generate widespread approval for actions and policies that previously had little support or were considered morally inappropriate by many. Communitarian philosopher Amitai Etzioni has developed an analytical framework which‚Äîmodeling historical examples‚Äîoutlines the reoccurring components of moral dialogues. Elements of moral dialogues include: establishing a moral baseline; sociological dialogue starters which initiate the process of developing new shared moral understandings; the linking of multiple groups' discussions in the form of ‚Äúmegalogues‚Äù; distinguishing the distinct attributes of the moral dialogue (apart from rational deliberations or culture wars); dramatization to call widespread attention to the issue at hand; and, closure through the establishment of a new shared moral understanding. Moral dialogues allow people of a given community to determine what is morally acceptable to a majority of people within the community.

Queen Victoria owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety became universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased by half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin condition colloquially known as \\"black skin disease\\". This is a genetic disease which causes the dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair. As of 2013, in terms of registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most popular breeds in the US, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their popularity worldwide.  Appearance  Pomeranians are small dogs weighing and standing high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters. The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and parti, plus combinations of those colors. The most common colors are orange, black, or cream/white. The merle Pomeranian is a recent colour developed by breeders. It is a combination of a solid base colour with a lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colours for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colours. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black. Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1‚Äì2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.

Pomeranians are typically friendly, lively and playful. They can be aggressive with other dogs and humans to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, but they can become dominant, willful and stubborn if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.  Health  The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter. = Common problems = Merle colored dogs may have mild to severe deafness, blindness, increased intraocular pressure, ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from parents who are also both merles may additionally have abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems. Luxating patella is another health issue in the Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either malformation or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to \\"luxate\\" (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain is caused by the knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped disc. Tracheal collapse is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as the dog ages. In Pomeranians, a condition often called \\"black skin disease\\" occurs which is a combination of alopecia (hair loss) and hyperpigmentation (a darkening of the skin). Other names for this condition include woolly coat, coat funk, pseudo- Cushing's disease, or severe hair loss syndrome. This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females, and may be inherited. Although most affected dogs show signs following puberty, it can occur at any age. Other conditions can mimic this condition including Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic skin infections, and reproductive hormone disorders. Another common disorder in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism. This is when either one or both of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of the retained testicle. = Exercise = The Pomeranian is a small but energetic breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from frequent attention, they need relatively little exercise: it is recommended to take them on several daily walks and let them run around an enclosed space.\\"Pomeranian Care: Energy and Exercise\\" , American Kennel Club, 2016  History = Origins = A miniature Pomeranian from 1915 The forerunners of today's Pomeranian breed were large working dogs from the Arctic regions. These dogs are commonly known as the Wolfspitz or Spitz type, which is German for \\"sharp point\\" which was the term originally used by Count Eberhard zu Sayn in the 16th century as a reference to the features of the dog's nose and muzzle. The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz. The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom. Portrait of Mr and Mrs William Hallett by Thomas Gainsborough, 1785. The painting features a larger type of Pomeranian than is now common. An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a diary entry in James Boswell's Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland. \\"The Frenchman had a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of.\\" The offspring of a Pomeranian and a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant's A Tour in Scotland from 1769. Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767, Queen Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of England, brought two Pomeranians to England. Named Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough. These paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as , but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over the back. Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she possibly named \\"Windsor's Marco\\" and was reported to weigh only . When she first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller-type Pomeranian to become immediately popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%. Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians of different colours from various European countries to add to her breeding program. Royal owners during this period also included Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon I of France, and King George IV of England. The first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written shortly afterwards. The first member of the breed was registered in America to the American Kennel Club in 1898, and it was recognized in 1900. In 1912, two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS Titanic. A Pomeranian called \\"Lady\\", owned by Miss Margaret Hays, escaped with her owner in lifeboat number seven, while Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild took her pet to safety with her in lifeboat number six. Glen Rose Flashaway won the Toy Group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1926, the first Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster. It would take until 1988 for the first Pomeranian, \\"Great Elms Prince Charming II\\", to win the Best in Show prize from the Westminster Kennel Club. In the standard published in 1998, the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard, along with the Keeshond, by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale. According to the standard \\"Spitz breeds are captivating\\" and have a \\"unique characteristic, cheeky appearance.\\" = Popularity = The Pomeranian has been among the more popular dog breeds in the United States, featuring consistently in the top 20 of registered AKC dog breeds since at least 1998, when it was ranked #10; the breed was #17 in the 2011 rankings, dropping two spots from the previous year. In 2012 and 2013 it remained in the top twenty and was ranked at #19. In 2015, the breed fell to #21, falling further to #22 in both 2016 and 2017. It is not listed in the top 20 breeds in the UK in either 2007 or 2008. In Australia their popularity has declined since 1986, with a peak of 1,128 Pomeranians registered with the Australian National Kennel Council in 1987; only 577 were registered in 2008. However, this is an increase from 2004, when only 491 dogs were registered. It is recognised that the common Pomeranian is listed as the 27th most intelligent dog with the German Shepherd sitting at no 1. It is more popular in American cities in 2008, ranking joint tenth (with American Bulldog) in Detroit and Orlando, ninth in Los Angeles, a joint seventh in Seattle (again, with the American Bulldog), but third in Honolulu, only bested by the Labrador Retriever and the German Shepherd.

Series creator Joss Whedon conceived the town as a representation of a generic California city, as well as a narrative parody of the all-too-serene towns typical in traditional horror films. Sunnydale is located on a \\"Hellmouth\\"; a portal \\"between this reality and the next\\", and convergence point of mystical energies.\\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\" (1.01) introduces the Hellmouth, which is referred to numerous times throughout the series. The entrance to the Hellmouth is seen under the school in \\"The Zeppo\\", \\"Doomed\\", \\"Conversations with Dead People\\", and throughout the second half of season seven. Environment =Sunnydale itself= Sunnydale's size and surroundings are implausible but justified given its origins ‚Äî to sustain a human population for supernatural evils to prey upon. The town's founder spared no expense to attract a populace, and Sunnydale thus contains many elements of a large city ‚Äî which the show's writers utilized fully for comic effect and narrative convenience. During the first three seasons, Sunnydale is shown to have 38,500 inhabitants,The \\"Welcome to Sunnydale\\" sign says 38,500 in two early episodes: \\"School Hard\\" (2.03) and \\"Lovers Walk\\" (3.08). very few high schools,In \\"Some Assembly Required\\" (2.02), the three dead cheerleaders attended Fondren High, which is \\"across town\\" from Sunnydale High. In \\"Reptile Boy\\" (2.05), Kent Preparatory School is mentioned. In \\"Dead Man's Party\\" (3.02) Joyce mentions a local all-girls school named Miss Porter's. Yet in most episodes \\"the high school\\" refers specifically to Sunnydale High. forty- three churches,Giles is surprised at this figure in \\"What's My Line, Part Two\\" (2.10). a small private college,Crestwood College is featured in \\"Reptile Boy\\" (2.05) but never mentioned again. a zoo,there are three visits to the zoo in \\"The Pack\\" (1.06), including a class trip and one trip by Buffy on foot. a museum,The museum director who receives the box containing the demon Acathla in \\"Becoming, Part One\\" (2.21) refers to Giles as being \\"right here in Sunnydale\\". and one modest main street. Even so, it has twelve gothic cemeteries.According to Giles in \\"Revelations\\" (3.07). These cemeteries are so heavily used that services are sometimes held at night.\\"Once More, with Feeling\\" (6.07). Sunnydale is divided into five neighborhoods. The first is the entertainment district which contains the Bronze, Sunnydale's nightclub, which attracts some well-known artists despite a clientele consisting mainly of high-school kids. The second is the alleys directly behind Bronze which contain the town's excess supply of pallets and cardboard. The high school makes the third neighborhood. The fourth neighborhood is filled in its entirety by the large graveyard, and lastly the suburban residential sprawl is the final neighborhood. The abundance of very nice homes is made possible by low property values caused by frequent murder.\\"Villains\\" (6.20) In later seasons it is revealed that Sunnydale contains a campus of the University of California system, as well as a profitable magic supply shop. The town is also seen to include a large park containing a creek and a lake, and one of its cemeteries is shown to be adjacent to a lake.\\"Help\\" (7.04). Sunnydale has a number of parks: Weatherly Park, Glebe Park, Radcliff Park and Nelson Park are just some of the examples. Sunnydale has a train station,Buffy finds dead bodies in the train in \\"Crush\\" (5.14). a bus station,The bus station is shown in \\"Inca Mummy Girl\\" (2.04), \\"What's My Line, Part One\\" (2.09), and \\"Showtime\\" (7.11), and mentioned in \\"Innocence\\" (2.14). a small airport,Kendra arrives by plane in \\"What's My Line, Part One\\" (2.09), and the airport itself is shown in \\"Choices\\" (3.19) and \\"Who Are You\\" (4.16) as well as \\"Bargaining I\\" (6.01). The airport shown in this episode is actually Burbank Airport with \\"Sunnydale\\" photoshopped over the word \\"Burbank\\". In \\"Tabula Rasa\\" (6.08), Giles's ticket shows an itinerary from Sunnydale Airport to Los Angeles International Airport and then to London Heathrow Airport, which is the same route announced on the public address system as Giles awaits his flight in \\"Bargaining, Part I\\" (6.01). and a small military base.In \\"Innocence\\" (2.14), Xander and Cordelia break into the base to steal a rocket launcher as part of his plan to destroy the Judge. There is also a seaport with a harbor deep enough to allow the docking of coastal freighters.In Episode 3/14, \\"Bad Girls,\\" Faith disposes of the body of the Deputy Mayor by weighting it down and sinking it in the harbor. In Episode 3/19, \\"Choices,\\" a box containing the mystic spiders Mayor Wilkins has to consume as part of the Ascension process comes in by water and the docks are shown. Directly beneath Sunnydale High School is a Hellmouth, a subterranean, mystical portal that attracts evil forces. This functions as a major plot device in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as it explains why vampires and other demons are so prevalent in Sunnydale. Sunnydale possesses many common horror-movie characteristics, such as an abundance of dark alleyways, abandoned mansions and factories, and an adult population that is either clueless or perpetually in denial, in stark contrast to the demon-fighting, supernaturally aware teens. By the show's seventh season, set in 2002‚Äì03, the city's population had fallen to 32,900.The \\"Welcome to Sunnydale\\" sign says 32,900 in \\"Conversations with Dead People\\" (7.07). In the spring, the town is almost completely evacuated. =Sunnydale's surroundings= Sunnydale has a somewhat isolated location.When Sunnydale is stricken by a town-wide epidemic ‚Äî such as the silence spell in \\"Hush\\" (4.10) ‚Äî no other towns seem to be nearby. The town is situated near several acres of woods and forest, including Miller's Woods.The woods in \\"Homecoming\\" (3.05) are named \\"Miller's Woods\\". In \\"Bargaining, Part Two\\" (6.02) and \\"Villains\\" (6.20) the woods are large enough to get lost in. Breaker's Woods is a 45-minute drive from town.Giles visited there during \\"Lovers Walk\\" (3.08). Sunnydale is located on or near the Pacific Ocean. An ocean port with several docked ships is nearby.The port is seen in \\"Surprise\\" (2.13) and \\"Consequences\\" (3.15). In \\"Consequences\\", Giles refers to Buffy and Faith's return from the docks as \\"coming back to town\\", indicating that the docks are not part of Sunnydale itself. Kingman's Bluff stands on a tall cliff overlooking the sea.Kingman's Bluff is the location of Willow's terrible spell (\\"Grave\\", 6.22). There is a beach not too far away.It is not specified how close this beach is to Sunnydale. It is seen in \\"Go Fish\\" (2.20) and \\"Buffy vs. Dracula\\" (5.01). Close to or in Sunnydale is an old quarry house built beside a deep lake, located a few feet from a cliff edge.Although the quarry house never appears in any episodes, it does make an appearance in the comic book series \\"The Blood of Carthage\\", which explains the house's Pre-Columbian origins. The house and its grounds also appear in the Chaos Bleeds video game. In addition, there is a hydroelectric dam in the vicinity of Sunnydale.In \\"As You Were\\" (6.15), Buffy, Riley and Riley's wife, Sam, fight a Suvolte demon on a dam they only drove a short distance to reach. Within a day's drive of Sunnydale is a desert.Giles drives Buffy to the desert in \\"Intervention\\" (5.18), and drives with the Potentials to the desert in \\"The Killer in Me\\" (7.13). It is stated several times that Sunnydale is approximately two hours' drive north of Los AngelesIn \\"Sanctuary\\" (Angel 1.19), cops refer to Sunnydale as being \\"up north\\", although it is also mentioned that Buffy's dad comes \\"down\\" from L.A. to visit In \\"Nightmares\\" (1.10), Buffy states \\"He's still in L.A. He, like, comes down for weekends sometimes.\\", implying that Sunnydale is south of L.A. In the final episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (\\"Chosen\\"), and also in the first issue of the Buffy: Season Eight comic book, Sunnydale is depicted being surrounded by desert terrain.At the end of \\"Chosen\\" (7.22) the town has sunk into a large pit, and the pit is completely surrounded by desert. It is shown this way in the comic book Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight #1, \\"The Long Way Home\\", pages 14-15. The episode \\"Pangs\\" reveals that Sunnydale is in the former homeland of the Chumash people, which is the area northwest of Los Angeles, centered on Santa Barbara County. The episode references a lost Spanish mission, which might be a reference to a historical mission originally located near Point Conception which was destroyed by an earthquake and relocated inland. The episode \\"Shadow\\" (5.08) contains a telephone directory ad for the Magic Box, which uses an 805 area code. This would indicate that Sunnydale is located in Santa Barbara County, or possibly Ventura County or San Luis Obispo County (all are along the coast north of Los Angeles but south of Monterey). =Maps of Sunnydale= Maps of Sunnydale have appeared at various times during the show: * A large map of \\"Sunnydale County\\" hangs on the wall of Principal Snyder's office and also on the wall of Mayor Wilkins' office.It was in the principal's office in \\"Dead Man's Party\\" (3.02), and in the mayor's office in various third-season episodes. The best view of the map is in \\"Choices\\" (3.19). Compare this with the map of Santa Barbara County at http://www.countyofsb.org/stats.asp. This is actually a map of Santa Barbara County, California with the words \\"Sunnydale County\\" superimposed on it. According to this map, Sunnydale is located at a bend on the California coast. To the south and west of Sunnydale is the Pacific Ocean. Joss Whedon stated in November 1998 that \\"Sunnydale is in fact near Santa Barbara.\\"Joss Whedon post on The Bronze posting board, November 22, 1998, archived here . * Giles uses a street map of Santa Barbara as a map of Sunnydale when he is plotting sightings of the Initiative commandos in the series' fourth season.\\"Doomed\\" (4.11) * A street map of central Sunnydale is used by the Scooby Gang twice in the seventh season.Once early in the season, and again in \\"Touched\\" (7.20). * In the seventh season, Andrew draws a map of Sunnydale to track the First's activities.Shown in \\"Get it Done\\" (7.15). The general shape of the coastline matches the map used in season three. According to Andrew's map, there are woods between Sunnydale and the ocean to the west and to the south, and directly southeast of the town, at the location where the coast bends, there is a dark forest. There are also woods to the east of Sunnydale, as well as railroad tracks. =Filming locations= Various southern California locations are used as stand-ins for Sunnydale: * The exterior shots, and some interior shots, of Buffy's home are of an actual home located in Torrance. * The exterior shots of Sunnydale High School (seasons 1‚Äì3) are of Torrance High School in Torrance, California. * The exterior shots of The Mansion (seasons 2‚Äì3) are of Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House in Los Feliz near Griffith Park. * Most of the University of California, Sunnydale scenes (season 4) were filmed at the University of California, Los Angeles, and in a closed sound stage designed to match the UCLA architecture. Some of the later scenes were filmed at a private business park. * The exterior shots of Sunnydale City Hall is the Iowa Courthouse Building, an office building in Torrance. * The exterior shots of New Sunnydale High School (season 7) were filmed at California State University, Northridge in Northridge, California. History=Prior to Buffy's arrival= Long before humans settled the area, a Hellmouth existed at the site of the future town of Sunnydale. In ancient times, a magic scythe was used at the site of the Hellmouth \\"to kill the last pure demon that walked upon the Earth.\\" After this, the scythe was hidden, and its last guardian remained, waiting in a pagan temple that would somehow remain unnoticed for centuries.\\"End of Days\\" (7.21). Centuries later, Navajo and Chumash peoples lived in this area. One or more groups of monks or friars also settled in this area.Navajo (Din√©) people are mentioned in \\"The Glittering World\\" in Tales of the Slayers. Chumash are mentioned in \\"Pangs\\" (4.08). One group of monks were mentioned by the ancient guardian in \\"End of Days\\" (7.21); a possibly different group in \\"Pangs\\" (4.08). As in general California history, these friars can safely be assumed to have been Spanish Franciscans, who arrived in California in the late 18th century.Spike and Andrew journey to a different mission in \\"Empty Places\\" (7.19). In 1812, there was an earthquake in the Sunnydale region that caused a cave-in during which an entire mission was lost; the very existence of the mission was soon forgotten. (The Mission La Purisima Concepci√≥n, originally sited near Point Conception and relocated to Lompoc would fit this description.)\\"Pangs\\" (4.08). Richard Wilkins arrived in California in the late 19th century, looking for gold. He founded Sunnydale (after considering the alternate names \\"Happydale\\" and \\"Sunny Acres\\") in a demon infested valley after a Navajo Slayer died there \\"The Glittering World\\", in Tales of the Slayers in 1899. He made a pact with the demons to found a town atop the Hellmouth for them \\"to feed on\\", in return for the promise of immortality by becoming a pure demon himself. Wilkins became Mayor of Sunnydale.\\"Enemies\\" (3.17). In the 1930s, there was at least one more major earthquake in Sunnydale. This caused a cave-in that swallowed up the Master and his lair, as well as the Satanist temple on Kingman's Bluff.Episode 6/22, \\"Grave.\\" Giles explains to Anya how Willow proposes to destroy the world and specifically refers to the temple as Satanist. There is a Satanist symbol on the top of the temple's steeple. (The date of this earthquake is given as either 1932 or 1937, although it is possible these were two distinct quakes.)In \\"The Harvest\\" (1.02), Willow refers to an earthquake in 1937 which \\"swallowed half the town\\", including the Master's lair. In \\"Grave\\" (6.22), Anya says that the temple on Kingman's Bluff was \\"swallowed up in the big earthquake of '32\\". It is possible they are referring to two different earthquakes, but it is also possible that one of them is simply misstating the date. Sometime in the 1980s or 1990s, Richard Wilkins was again elected mayor, now under the name of \\"Richard Wilkins III\\", and served more than one term.\\"Enemies\\" (3.17). A sign saying \\"Reelect Mayor Wilkins\\" is visible; since no election is currently being held, this indicates a past re- election bid. By the 1990s, Sunnydale appeared to have become a typical town on the California coast, with a popular mayor, a police force that Principal Snyder describes as \\"deeply stupid,\\"Episode 2/22, \\"Becoming, Part 2.\\" and a local newspaper (the Sunnydale PressIt can be seen in \\"Never Kill a Boy on the First Date\\", \\"Reptile Boy\\", \\"Becoming, Part One\\", \\"Bad Girls\\", \\"Consequences\\", \\"Graduation Day, Part One\\", \\"Hush\\", and \\"Once More, with Feeling\\".). However, Mayor Wilkins had instructed the police to cover up any supernatural or mysterious violence occurring in the city, and had instructed Principal Snyder to cover up supernatural violence occurring at Sunnydale High.In \\"Lovers Walk\\" (3.08), Wilkins refers to having covered up Spike and Drusilla's rampages during season two. Snyder and the police chief discuss these coverups in \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\" (2.19). Wilkins and Snyder discuss it in \\"Graduation Day, Part 1\\" (3.21).  Mystic artifacts  At some point in Sunnydale's history, the following mystic artifacts were hidden throughout the town's cemeteries and perhaps elsewhere: * the du Lac Cross (found in \\"What's My Line, Part One\\") * some, but not all, of the scattered remnants of the Judge (found and reassembled in \\"Surprise\\"); other pieces were found elsewhere and shipped to Sunnydale * the Glove of Myhneghon (found in \\"Revelations\\") * the Amulet of Balthazar (found in \\"Bad Girls\\") * the Gem of Amarra (found in \\"The Harsh Light of Day\\") =During the series= The series begins when Buffy Summers, the current vampire slayer, moves to 1630 Revello Drive, and begins attending Sunnydale High School. There she meets new friends, including Willow Rosenberg, Xander Harris, and her new watcher, Rupert Giles. This \\"Scooby Gang\\", eventually including popular cheerleader Cordelia Chase and Willow's boyfriend Oz, often hangs out at the Bronze, the Espresso Pump (a local coffee house with a retro gas station motif) and the Sun Cinema. Buffy's mother, Joyce, works in an art gallery in Sunnydale. (It is not clear whether or not she owns the gallery.) During their time in high school, Buffy and her friends fight a number of vampires, most notably the Master, Angel a vampire with a soul, who fell in love with Buffy; Spike, Drusilla, and Angelus (when Angel had lost his soul). Another slayer, Faith, arrives in their senior year of high school (Season 3) and lives at the Downtowner MotelThe sign reads \\"Downtowner Motel/Apt.\\" in \\"The Zeppo\\" (3.12) and others. until she joins forces with Mayor Wilkins. In the third season episode \\"The Wish\\", Cordelia angrily wishes that Buffy Summers had never arrived in Sunnydale, and her wish is granted by vengeance demon Anyanka. Cordelia finds herself in an alternate universe where The Master has risen to the surface and completely taken over the town, with the surviving human population living in terror of the vampires. The school is sparsely populated; curfews are strict; humans wear crosses and drab colors to avoid attracting vampires; and almost all of the people she knew are either dead or have been turned into vampires. At the end of the third season (June 1999), Sunnydale High School is destroyed in a great conflict that kills Mayor Wilkins and Principal Snyder. After this point, there is no mention in the television show of the political leaders of the city. The police occasionally appear, but the police chief does not. There is no further discussion of the police covering up supernatural evidence, although one newspaper headline suggests this may have continued.In \\"Once More, with Feeling\\" (6.07), the headline of the Sunnydale Press states, \\"MAYHEM CAUSED. MONSTERS CERTAINLY NOT INVOLVED, OFFICIALS SAY.\\" As the fourth season begins (fall 1999), Buffy and Willow begin attending the University of California, Sunnydale. There they discover that the United States government was operating a \\"black\\" (secret) military unit, The Initiative, and has a laboratory and demon confinement complex in a cavern beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. The Initiative is closed down at the end of the season (spring 2000) after a climactic battle with the cyborg Adam. By this time, Tara Maclay and Anya have been added to the Scooby Gang. Later this same year, Giles purchases a magic shop named The Magic Box.\\"The Real Me\\" (5.02), which has been seen multiple times previously ‚Äî for example, in \\"Lovers Walk\\" (3.08), at which time it is called Uncle Bob's Magic Cabinet. Sometime between the fourth and fifth seasons (during the summer of 2000), the mysterious \\"Key\\" is transformed into Buffy's younger \\"sister\\", Dawn Summers and the evil goddess Glory arrives in the town, leading to an increase in the number of mentally ill patients due to her ability to suck the sanity from their brains to maintain her own. The next year brings the deaths of Joyce Summers and Buffy herself (although Buffy is returned from the grave by a magic spell cast by Willow). After this point, Buffy and Dawn become co-owners of the family house.Joyce's will would have either left the house to Buffy or to Buffy and Dawn. In \\"Empty Places\\" (7.19), Dawn tells Buffy \\"this is my house, too.\\" Before Season 5's end, a scene in the city would be shown at least once in the second season of Buffys spinoff, Angel. In the episode \\"Disharmony\\", Cordelia Chase calls Willow from Los Angeles when her high school friend Harmony Kendall turns up. We see Willow's side of this call in a rare Sunnydale scene for this series. Angel himself returns to Sunnydale at least four times in Buffy seasons 4, 5 and 7. At the end of the sixth season (spring 2002), the Magic Box is demolished in a battle between Willow and Buffy. At the beginning of the seventh season (fall 2002), Sunnydale High School is rebuilt on the same location as before ‚Äî directly over the Hellmouth. By this time, knowledge of supernatural phenomena seems to be slowly growing in the town. Sunnydale's population is also revealed to have dropped to 32,900.The \\"Welcome to Sunnydale\\" sign lists a population 38,500 in several early episodes, including \\"School Hard\\" (2.03) and \\"Lovers Walk\\" (3.08). In \\"Conversations with Dead People\\", meanwhile, it gives a population of 32,900 (7.07). The sign is visible for a moment at the end of \\"Chosen\\" (7.22) but the population figure is not legible. In the second half of the seventh season (early 2003), supernatural manifestations at Sunnydale High reach unprecedented levels. Within less than a month, virtually the entire population of the town flees in a mass evacuation.The evacuation is seen at the beginning of \\"Empty Places\\" (7.19), although the Bronze is still crowded. By the next episode, \\"Touched\\" (7.20), the town is virtually empty. Soon thereafter, the cataclysmic showdown between the Scooby Gang, the Potential Slayers Buffy has gathered together, and the First Evil results in the complete obliteration of the town. Sunnydale collapses into a giant pit, closing the entrance to the Hellmouth.\\"Chosen\\" (7.22). During the weeks between the series finale of Buffy and the Season 5 premiere of Angel, Lindsey McDonald makes an off-screen trip to the crater and digs up the amulet worn by Spike in the final battle. He sends it to Angel at Wolfram & Hart where it releases an incorporeal Spike. The destruction of the city is mentioned several times during Angel's final season, mainly tying into Spike's brief ghostly status. It is seen one more time when a military general oversees the crater in Season 8. The destruction of the town has also led the U.S. government to brand the Scooby Gang and their Slayers an international terrorist group. In the final arc of Season 8, the Scooby Gang return to the ruins of Sunnydale to secure the Seed of Wonder, an artifact that is the source of all magic on Earth, and serves as a battleground between themselves and a massive legion of extra-dimensional demons.

It was founded in 1909 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and today it is a subsidiary of GFR Media. Its headquarters are in Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. History=El Dia= Ponce (1945-1970), now on display at Museo de la Historia de Ponce El Nuevo D√≠a was founded in 1909 in the city of Ponce as \\"El Diario de Puerto Rico,\\" later changing its name to \\"El D√≠a\\" in 1911, a name it kept for nearly seven decades. Its founder was Guillermo V. Cintr√≥n, with assistance from Eugenio Astol and Nemesio Canales. Its editorial staff consisted of Felix Matos Bernier, Juan Braschi, Nemesio R. Canales, Felix Astol, and Eugenio Deschamps. In 1928 Guillermo V. Cintron sold the paper to Guillermo Vivas Valdivieso who formed an editorial team consisting of the three Gil De Lamadrid brothers (Jesus, Joaquin and Alfredo), Enrique Colon Barega, and Julio Enrique Monagas, and published the paper until 1945. Under his directorship the paper also started distribution in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 8 November 1945, the newspaper was acquired by Ponce native and future governor Luis A. Ferr√©. Its board of directors consisted of Raul Matos Balaguer, Arturo Gallardo Guerrero, Miguel Sotero Palermo, Juan A. Wirshing, and Luis A. Ferre. After Ferr√© was elected governor of Puerto Rico in 1968, his eldest son, Antonio Luis Ferr√©, purchased the paper from his father. The paper's slogan was \\"Y vivamos la moral, que es lo que nos hace falta\\" (roughly, \\"And let us live by the moral yardstick, which is what we need).Neysa Rodriguez Deynes, Ph. D., curator. Journalism Hall. Museo de la Historia de Ponce. Ponce, Puerto Rico. March 2011. =El Nuevo D√≠a= Two years after this, in 1970, Antonio Luis moved the newspaper to San Juan and renamed it \\"El Nuevo D√≠a\\". The paper's first director under Antonio Luis Ferre was Carlos Casta√±eda. During its first years in San Juan, El Nuevo Dia's newsroom was located in the \\"Torre de la Reina\\" building, near the Luis Mu√±oz Rivera Park in Puerta de Tierra. It subsequently moved, in 1986, to its current location municipality of Guaynabo. \\"El Nuevo D√≠a\\" continues to be owned and published by the Ferr√© family. The newspaper's current president is Mar√≠a Eugenia Ferr√© Rangel and the current editor is Luis Alberto Ferr√© Rangel. As of 2006, El Nuevo D√≠a is the most widely read newspaper in Puerto Rico, with a daily circulation of 155,000. Its main competitor in terms of sales is El Vocero. Content-wise, both papers have somewhat different news formats and audiences. While El Nuevo D√≠a has been known largely for its political reporting, El Vocero has traditionally taken a more tabloid-oriented approach, giving greater prominence to news stories on daily street crime. More recently, however, \\"El Vocero\\" has begun to put greater emphasis to political and business news, making it a more direct competitor to \\"El Nuevo D√≠a.\\" In addition to its political and community sections, El Nuevo D√≠a also has sports, entertainment and business sections. Its previous television commercial campaign slogan read: El Nuevo D√≠a: Un Gran Periodico (\\"El Nuevo D√≠a: A Great Newspaper\\"). The campaign slogan recently changed to \\"El Nuevo D√≠a: Conocer es Crecer\\" (\\"El Nuevo D√≠a: To Know is to Grow\\"). From 2003 to 2008, El Nuevo D√≠a had an Orlando edition called El Nuevo Dia Orlando. It started publication on 2 September 2003 and was published on weekdays. On 13 November 2006, the newspaper began to circulate free of charge. The paper printed 25,000 copies daily. A study showed that 96% percent of people who read the Orlando edition read it at home. The Orlando edition ceased publication on 29 August 2008.

He belongs to the realist school of international relations. He made important contributions to the theory of defensive neorealism and has authored the balance of threat theory. Books that he has authored or coauthored include Origins of Alliances, Revolution and War, and The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy. Early life and education Walt was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where his father, a physicist, worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory. His mother was a teacher. The family moved to the Bay Area when Walt was about eight months old. Walt grew up in Los Altos Hills. He pursued his undergraduate studies at Stanford University. He first majored in chemistry with an eye to becoming a biochemist but then shifted to history and finally to international relations. After attaining his B.A., Walt began graduate work at University of California at Berkeley and graduated with a M.A. in Political Science in 1978 and a Ph.D. in Political Science in 1983. Career Walt taught at Princeton University and the University of Chicago, where he served as Master of the Social Science Collegiate Division and Deputy Dean of Social Sciences. As of 2015, he holds the Robert and Renee Belfer Professorship in International Affairs in the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. =Other professional activities= Walt was elected a Fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in May 2005. He spoke at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University in 2010. In 2012, Walt took part in a panel at the one-state solution conference at the Kennedy School, along with Ali Abunimah and Eve Spangler. Walt spoke at Clark University in April 2013. He gave a talk at the College of William and Mary in October 2013: \\"Why US Foreign Policy Keeps Failing.\\" He delivered the 2013 F.H. Hinsley Lecture at Cambridge University. Opinions=American power and culture= In a comprehensive 2005 article, \\"Taming American Power,\\" Walt argued that the US should \\"make its dominant position acceptable to others ‚Äì by using military force sparingly, by fostering greater cooperation with key allies, and, most important of all, by rebuilding its crumbling international image.\\" He proposed for the US \\"resume its traditional role as an 'offshore balancer,'\\" to intervene \\"only when absolutely necessary,\\" and to keep \\"its military presence as small as possible.\\" In a late 2011 article for The National Interest, \\"The End of the American Era,\\" Walt wrote that America is losing its position of world dominance. Walt gave a speech in 2013 to the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, \\"Why does US foreign policy keep failing?\\" The Institute later described him as seeing \\"an overwhelming bias among US foreign policy institutions toward an activist foreign policy\\" and \\"a propensity to exaggerate threats, noting the chances of being struck by lightning have been far greater since 2001 than death by terrorist attack.\\" He also characterized the US as lacking \\"diplomatic skill and finesse\\" and advised Europeans \\"to think of themselves and not rely on the US for guidance or advice on solving their security issues.\\" Ultimately, he argued that \\"the United States is simply not skilled enough to run the world.\\" \\"Why are Americans so willing to pay taxes in order to support a world-girdling national security establishment,\\" asked Walt in 2013, \\"yet so reluctant to pay taxes to have better schools, health care, roads, bridges, subways, parks, museums, libraries, and all the other trappings of a wealthy and successful society?\\" He said that the question was especially puzzling given that \\"the United States is the most secure power in history and will remain remarkably secure unless it keeps repeating the errors of the past decade or so.\\" =Foreign policy= A critic of military interventionism, Walt stated, \\"Hawks like to portray opponents of military intervention as 'isolationist' because they know it is a discredited political label. Yet there is a coherent case for a more detached and selective approach to U.S. grand strategy, and one reason that our foreign policy establishment works so hard to discredit is their suspicion that a lot of Americans might find it convincing if they weren't constantly being reminded about looming foreign dangers in faraway places. The arguments in favor of a more restrained grand strategy are far from silly, and the approach makes a lot more sense to than neoconservatives' fantasies of global primacy or liberal hawks' fondness for endless quasi-humanitarian efforts to reform whole regions.\\" =Europe= In 1998, Walt wrote that \\"deep structural forces\\" were \\"beginning to pull Europe and America apart.\\" Walt argues that NATO must be sustained because of four major areas in which close co-operation is beneficial to European and American interest. # Defeating international terrorism; Walt sees a need for cooperation between Europe and the United States in managing terrorist networks and stopping the flow of money to terror cells. # Limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction; Walt argues that anti-proliferation efforts are most successful when Europe and the U.S. work in concert to bring loose nuclear material into responsible custody. He cites the case of Libya's willingness to abandon its nascent fission program after being pressured multilaterally as evidence of this. # Managing the world economy; lowering barriers to trade and investment particularly between the U.S. and the E.U. will accelerate economic growth. Notable differences in trade policy stem mainly in areas of agricultural policy. # Dealing with failed states; failed states are breeding grounds for anti-Western movements. Managing failed states such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and Somalia require a multinational response since the U.S. has insufficient wealth to modernise and rebuild these alone. In this area, European allies are especially desirable because they have more experience with peacekeeping and \\"nation-building\\". =Eastern Europe and Russia= Walt believes that extending invitations for NATO membership to countries in the former Soviet bloc is a \\"dangerous and unnecessary goal\\" and that nations such as Ukraine ought to be \\"neutral buffer state(s) in perpetuity.\\" From that perspective, he believes that arming Ukrainian armed forces after the annexation of the Crimea by Russia \\"is a recipe for a longer and more destructive conflict.\\" =Middle East= Walt said in December 2012 that America's \\"best course in the Middle East would be to act as an 'offshore balancer': ready to intervene if the balance of power is upset, but otherwise keeping our military footprint small. We should also have normal relationship with states like Israel and Saudi Arabia, instead of the counterproductive 'special relationships' we have today.\\" An article by Walt, ‚Ä≥What Should We Do if the Islamic State Wins? Live with it,‚Ä≥ appeared on June 10, 2015 in Foreign Policy Magazine. He explained his view that the Islamic State was unlikely to grow into a longlasting world power on Point of Inquiry, the podcast of the Center for Inquiry in July 2015. =Israel= Walt has been a critic of the Israel lobby in the United States and the influence he says that it has on its foreign policy. He wrote that Barack Obama erred by breaking with the principles in his Cairo speech by allowing continued Israeli settlement and by participating in a \\"well-coordinated assault\\" against the Goldstone Report. Walt suggested in 2010 that State Department diplomat Dennis Ross's alleged partiality toward Israel might make him give Obama advice that was against US interests.Walt, Stephen. \\"On Dual Loyalty \\", Foreign Affairs (April 2, 2010). Robert Satloff, executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP), defended Ross and criticized Walt in a piece published by Foreign Affairs, which had published Walt's piece a few days earlier. A copy of the Satloff piece is available here on the website of WINEP. Satloff wrote that Ross's connection to WINEP is innocuous (Ross was a distinguished fellow at WINEP throughout George W. Bush's administration, and Mearsheimer and Walt's book described WINEP as \\"part of the core\\" of the Israel lobby in the United States) and that Walt mistakenly believes that the US cannot simultaneously \\"advance strategic partnership both with Israel and with friendly Arab and Muslim states.\\" After the Itamar attack, in which a Jewish family was killed on the West Bank in March 2011, Walt condemned the murderers but added that \\"while we are at it, we should not spare the other parties who have helped create and perpetuate the circumstances.\\" He listed \\"every Israeli government since 1967, for actively promoting the illegal effort to colonize these lands;\\", \\"Palestinian leaders who have glorified violence;\\" and \\"the settlers themselves, some of whom routinely use violence to intimidate the Palestinians who live in the lands they covet.\\" Walt criticized the US for voting against a Security Council resolution condemning Israel's West Bank settlements and called the vote a \\"foolish step\\" because \\"the resolution was in fact consistent with the official policy of every president since Lyndon Johnson.\\" =Iran= Walt has frequently criticized America's policy with respect to Iran. In 2011, Walt told an interviewer that the American reaction to an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in the United States \\"might be part of a larger American diplomatic effort to put Iran on the hot seat.\\" \\"Washington continues to insist on a near-total Iranian capitulation,\\" wrote Walt in December 2012. \\"And because Iran has been effectively demonized here in America, it would be very hard for President Obama to reach a compromise and then sell it back home.\\" Walt said in November 2013, \\"Americans often forget just how secure the United States is, especially compared with other states,\\" thanks to its power, resources, and geography, and thus \\"routinely blows minor threats out of all proportion. I mean: Iran has a defense budget of about $10 billion... yet we manage to convince ourselves that Iran is a Very Serious Threat to U.S. vital interests. Ditto the constant fretting about minor-league powers like Syria, North Korea, Muammar al-Qaddafi's Libya, and other so-called 'rogue states.'\\" Therefore, whatever happens in the Middle East, \\"the United States can almost certainly adjust and adapt and be just fine.\\" =Libya= After visiting Libya, Walt wrote in Foreign Policy in January 2010 that while \\"Libya is far from a democracy, it also doesn't feel like other police states that I have visited. I caught no whiff of an omnipresent security service‚Äîwhich is not to say that they aren't there.... The Libyans with whom I spoke were open and candid and gave no sign of being worried about being overheard or reported or anything like that.... I tried visiting various political websites from my hotel room and had no problems, although other human rights groups report that Libya does engage in selective filtering of some political websites critical of the regime. It is also a crime to criticize Qaddafi himself, the government's past human rights record is disturbing at best, and the press in Libya is almost entirely government-controlled. Nonetheless, Libya appears to be more open than contemporary Iran or China and the overall atmosphere seemed far less oppressive than most places I visited in the old Warsaw Pact.\\" David E. Bernstein, Foundation Professor at the George Mason University School of Law, criticized Walt in 2011 for accepting funding from the Libyan government for a trip to Libya in which he addressed that country's Economic Development Board and then wrote what Bernstein called \\"a puff piece\\" about his visit. Bernstein said it was ironic that \\"Walt, after fulminating about the American domestic 'Israel Lobby'\\" had thus become \\"a part of the 'Libya lobby'\\". Bernstein also found it ironic that \\"Walt, a leading critic of the friendship the U.S. and Israel, concludes his piece with the hope 'that the United States and Libya continue to nurture and build a constructive relationship.' Because, you know, Israel is so much nastier than Qaddafi's Libya.\\" Under the headline \\"Is Stephen Walt Blind, a Complete Fool, or a Big Liar?\\", Martin Peretz of the New Republic mocked Walt for praising Libya, which Peretz called a \\"murderous place\\" and for viewing its dictator as \\"civilized.\\" Peretz contrasted Walt's view of Libya, which, Peretz noted, he had visited for less than a day. =Syria= In August 2013, Walt argued that even if it turned out that Bashar al-Assad of Syria had used chemical weapons, the US should not intervene. \\"Dead is dead, no matter how it is done,\\" wrote Walt. \\"Obama may be tempted to strike because he foolishly drew a 'red line' over this issue and feels his credibility is now at stake. But following one foolish step with another will not restore that lost standing.\\" In September 2013, Walt wrote an open letter asking his representative to vote against a strike on Syria. Dr. Josef Olmert pointed out \\"at least two glaring inaccuracies,\\" including Walt's failure to recognize that Syria is already a failed state and already riven by sectarian struggle, \\"something that 'realist' liberals find somehow hard to accept.\\" Olmert noted that despite Walt's professed belief that Israel is at the center of all Middle East conflicts, Israel in fact has nothing to do with the conflicts in Syria, Egypt, Tunisia, or other countries in the region, which \\"are mostly the makings of the Arabs, ones which ought to be solved by them.\\" =Asia= Walt posits that offshore balancing is the most desirable strategy to deal with China. In 2011, Walt argued that China will seek to gain regional hegemony and a broad sphere of influence in Asia, which was comparable in size to the US position in the Western Hemisphere. If that happens, he predicts that China would be secure enough on the mainland to give added attention to shaping events to its favour in far flung areas. Since China is resource-poor, it will likely aim to safeguard vital sea lanes in areas such as the Persian Gulf. In a December 2012 interview, Walt said that \\"the United States does not help its own cause by exaggerating Chinese power. We should not base our policy today on what China might become twenty or thirty years down the road.\\" =\\"Balance of threat\\" theory= Walt developed the 'balance of threat' theory, which defined threats in terms of aggregate power, geographic proximity, offensive power, and aggressive intentions. It is a modification of the \\"balance of power\\" theory, whose framework was refined by neorealist Kenneth Waltz. =Snowden case= In July 2013, Walt argued that Obama should give Edward Snowden an immediate pardon. \\"Mr Snowden's motives,\\" wrote Walt, \\"were laudable: he believed fellow citizens should know their government was conducting a secret surveillance programme enormous in scope, poorly supervised and possibly unconstitutional. He was right.\\" History, Walt suggested, \\"will probably be kinder to Mr Snowden than to his pursuers, and his name may one day be linked to the other brave men and women ‚Äì Daniel Ellsberg, Martin Luther King Jr., Mark Felt, Karen Silkwood and so on ‚Äì whose acts of principled defiance are now widely admired.\\" Books In his 1987 book The Origins of Alliances, Walt examines the way in which alliances are made and \\"proposes a fundamental change in the present conceptions of alliance systems.\\" Revolution and War (1996) exposes \\"the flaws in existing theories about the relationship between revolution and war\\" by studying in detail the French, Russian, and Iranian Revolutions and providing briefer views of the American, Mexican, Turkish, and Chinese Revolutions. Taming American Power (2005) provides a thorough critique of US strategy from the perspective of its adversaries. Anatol Lieven called it \\"a brilliant contribution to the American foreign policy debate.\\" The Hell of Good Intentions: America's Foreign Policy Elite and the Decline of U.S. Primacy was published on 16 October 2018. =The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy= In March 2006, John Mearsheimer and Walt, then academic dean of the Kennedy School of Government, published a working paper, \\"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\\"Mearsheimer, John and Walt, Stephen. \\"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\\", JFK School of Government, Working Paper RWP06-011 (March 13, 2006). The JFK School of Government reportedly removed its logo from the working paper. See Rosner, Shmuel. \\"Kennedy School removes its logo from lobby 'study'\\", Rosner's Blog, Haaretz (May 10, 2006). and an article entitled \\"The Israel Lobby\\" in the London Review of Books on the negative effects of \\"the unmatched power of the Israel Lobby.\\" They defined the Israel lobby as \\"the loose coalition of individuals and organizations who actively work to steer US foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction.\\" Mearsheimer and Walt took this position: \\"What the Israel lobby wants, it too often gets.\\"Mearsheimer, John and Walt, Stephen. \\"Unrestricted Access\\", Foreign Policy (May/June 2006). The articles, as well as the bestselling book that Walt and Mearsheimer later developed, generated considerable media coverage throughout the world. Contending that Walt and Mearsheimer are members of a \\"school that essentially wishes that the war with jihadism had never started,\\" Christopher Hitchens concluded, \\"Wishfulness has led them to seriously mischaracterize the origins of the problem....\\" Former US Ambassador Edward Peck wrote the \\"tsunami\\" of responses condemning the report proved the existence of the lobby and \\"Opinions differ on the long-term costs and benefits for both nations, but the lobby's views of Israel's interests have become the basis of U.S. Middle East policies.\\"Of Course There Is an Israel Lobby , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 6, 2006.

It is a concept derived from the Buddhist teaching of the , specifically , and . Characteristics of aesthetics and principles include asymmetry, roughness, simplicity, economy, austerity, modesty, intimacy, and the appreciation of both natural objects and the forces of nature. Description According to Leonard Koren, can be described as \\"the most conspicuous and characteristic feature of what we think of as traditional Japanese beauty. It occupies roughly the same position in the Japanese pantheon of aesthetic values as do the Greek ideals of beauty and perfection in the West.\\" Another description of by Andrew Juniper notes that, \\"If an object or expression can bring about, within us, a sense of serene melancholy and a spiritual longing, then that object could be said to be .\\" For Richard Powell, \\" nurtures all that is authentic by acknowledging three simple realities: nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect.\\" The words and do not translate directly into English; originally referred to the loneliness of living in nature, remote from society; meant \\"chill\\", \\"lean\\" or \\"withered\\".

It can also be used to refer to the quirks and anomalies that arise from the process of making something, which are seen to add uniqueness and elegance to the finished object. refers to the beauty or serenity that comes with age, when the life of the object and its impermanence are evidenced in its patina and wear, or in any visible repairs.

From an engineering or design point of view, may be interpreted as the imperfect quality of any object, due to inevitable limitations in design and construction/manufacture especially with respect to unpredictable or changing usage conditions; in this instance, could be interpreted as the aspect of imperfect reliability, or the limited mortality of any object, hence the phonological and etymological connection with the Japanese word (lit., \\"to rust\\"). Although the kanji characters for \\"rust\\" are not the same as in , the original spoken word (pre-kanji, ) are believed to be one and the same.ÈåÜ„Å≥„Çí„ÇÅ„Åê„ÇãË©±È°å, ‰∫ï‰∏äÂãù‰πü, Ë£≥ËèØÊàø, 1994„Åï„Å≥„ÅÆÊñáÂ≠ó on the Kinugawa Chain Mfg. Co. Ltd website Modern tea vessel made in the style A good example of this embodiment may be seen in certain styles of Japanese pottery. In the Japanese tea ceremony, the pottery items used are often rustic and simple looking, e.g. ware, with shapes that are not quite symmetrical, and colors or textures that appear to emphasize an unrefined or simple style. In fact, it is up to the knowledge and observational ability of the participant to notice and discern the hidden signs of a truly excellent design or glaze (akin to the appearance of a diamond in the rough). This may be interpreted as a kind of aesthetic, further confirmed by the way the colour of glazed items is known to change over time as hot water is repeatedly poured into them () and the fact that tea bowls are often deliberately chipped or nicked at the bottom (), which serves as a kind of signature of the style. and both suggest sentiments of desolation and solitude. In the Mahayana Buddhist view of the universe, these may be viewed as positive characteristics, representing liberation from a material world and transcendence to a simpler life. Mahayana philosophy itself, however, warns that genuine understanding cannot be achieved through words or language, so accepting on nonverbal terms may be the most appropriate approach. Simon Brown notes that describes a means whereby students can learn to live life through the senses and better engage in life as it happens, rather than be caught up in unnecessary thoughts. In this sense is the material representation of Zen Buddhism. The idea is that being surrounded by natural, changing, unique objects helps us connect to our real world and escape potentially stressful distractions. In one sense is a training whereby the student of learns to find the most basic, natural objects interesting, fascinating and beautiful. Fading autumn leaves would be an example. can change our perception of the world to the extent that a chip or crack in a vase makes it more interesting and gives the object greater meditative value. Similarly materials that age such as bare wood, paper and fabric become more interesting as they exhibit changes that can be observed over time. The and concepts are religious in origin, but actual usage of the words in Japanese is often quite casual because of the syncretic nature of Japanese belief. In Japanese arts Many forms of Japanese art have been influenced by Zen and Mahayana philosophy over the past thousand years, with the concepts of the acceptance and contemplation of imperfection, and constant flux and impermanence of all things being particularly important to Japanese arts and culture. As a result, many of these artforms contain and exemplify the ideals of , and several display the concept's aesthetical senses particularly well. Examples include: * (the traditional (bamboo flute) music of wandering Zen monks) * (the art of flower arrangement) * The cultivation of bonsai (miniature trees) - a typical bonsai design features wood with a rough texture, pieces of deadwood, and trees with hollow trunks, all intended to highlight the passage of time and nature. Bonsai are often displayed in the autumn or after they have shed leaves for the winter, in order to admire their bare branches. * Traditional Japanese gardens, such as Zen gardens (tray gardens) * Japanese poetry * Japanese pottery, such as ware, ware and * Japanese tea ceremony A contemporary Japanese exploration of the concept of can be found in the influential essay In Praise of Shadows by . Western use Many Western designers, writers, poets and artists have utilised ideals within their work to varying degrees, with some considering the concept a key proponent of their art, and others using it only minimally. Designer Leonard Koren (born 1948) in published for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers (1994) as an examination of , contrasting it with Western ideals of beauty. According to Penelope Green, Koren's book subsequently \\"became a talking point for a wasteful culture intent on penitence and a touchstone for designers of all stripes.\\" concepts historically had extreme importance in the development of Western studio pottery; Bernard Leach (1887‚Äì1979) was deeply influenced by Japanese aesthetics and techniques, which is evident in his foundational book \\"A Potter's Book\\". The work of American artist John Connell (1940‚Äì2009) is also considered to be centered on the idea of ;Hess Art Collection, Hatje Cantz, 2010 other artists who have employed the idea include former Stuckist artist and remodernist filmmaker Jesse Richards (born 1975), who employs it in nearly all of his work, along with the concept of . Some haiku in English also adopt the aesthetic in written style, creating spare, minimalist poems that evoke loneliness and transience, such as Nick Virgilio's \\"autumn twilight:/ the wreath on the door/ lifts in the wind\\".Cor van den Heuvel, editor. The Haiku Anthology. Fireside, 1986. p285 During the 1990s, the concept was borrowed by computer software developers and employed in agile programming and Wiki, used to describe acceptance of the ongoing imperfection of computer programming produced through these methods. On 16 March 2009, Marcel Theroux presented \\"In Search of \\" on BBC Four ,as part of the channel's Hidden Japan season of programming, travelling throughout Japan trying to understand the aesthetic tastes of its people. Theroux began by comically enacting a challenge from the book Living by Taro Gold, asking members of the public on a street in Tokyo to describe - the results of which showed that, just as Gold predicted, \\"they will likely give you a polite shrug and explain that is simply unexplainable.\\"Gold, Taro.

It is common through temperate Eurosiberia. It is highly migratory over most of its extensive range, wintering further south as far as North Africa, northern India, Pakistan, and parts of China. It migrates mainly by day, often in large flocks. Lowland breeders in westernmost areas of Europe are resident. It occasionally is a vagrant to North America, especially after storms, as in the Canadian sightings after storms in December 1927 and in January 1966. It is a wader that breeds on cultivated land and other short vegetation habitats. 3‚Äì4 eggs are laid in a ground scrape. The nest and young are defended noisily and aggressively against all intruders, up to and including horses and cattle. In winter, it forms huge flocks on open land, particularly arable land and mud-flats. Etymology The name lapwing has been variously attributed to the \\"lapping\\" sound its wings make in flight, from the irregular progress in flight due to its large wings (the Oxford English Dictionary derives this from an Old English word meaning \\"to totter\\"), or from its habit of drawing potential predators away from its nest by trailing a wing as if broken. The names peewit, pewit, tuit or tew-it are onomatopaeic and refer to the bird's characteristic call. The scientific name Vanellus is Medieval Latin for the northern lapwing and derives from vannus a winnowing fan. Description The northern lapwing is a long bird with a wingspan and a body mass of . It has rounded wings and a crest. It is also the shortest-legged of the lapwings. It is mainly black and white, but the back is tinted green. The male has a long crest and a black crown, throat and breast contrasting with an otherwise white face. Females and young birds have shorter crests, and have less strongly marked heads, but plumages are otherwise quite similar. Display calls, Surrey, England This is a vocal bird in the breeding season, with constant calling as the crazed tumbling display flight is performed by the male. The typical contact call is a loud, shrill \\"pee-wit\\" from which they get their other name of peewit. Displaying males usually make a wheezy \\"pee-wit, wit wit, eeze wit\\" during their display flight, these birds also make squeaking or mewing sounds. It feeds primarily on insects and other small invertebrates. This species often feeds in mixed flocks with golden plovers and black-headed gulls, the latter often robbing the two plovers, but providing a degree of protection against predators. Like the golden plovers, this species prefers to feed at night when there is moonlight. The northern lapwing is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Population decline Chick in the Netherlands Egg ‚Äì MHNT National surveys of England and Wales have shown a population decline between 1987 and 1998, and since 2009 the northern lapwing has had red list conservation status in the United Kingdom. The numbers of this species have been adversely affected by intensive agricultural techniques. In the lowlands this includes the loss of rough grassland, conversion to arable or improved grassland, loss of mixed farms, and switch from spring- to autumn-sown crops. In the uplands, the losses may have been due to increases in grazing density. Natural England gives grant aid to help restore lapwing habitat within its Environmental Stewardship Scheme. The organisation suggests an option within this scheme called 'Fallow plots for ground-nesting birds'. Uncropped plots at least in size provide nesting habitat and are located in suitable arable fields, which provide additional foraging habitat. Locating the plots within of extensively grazed grassland will provide additional foraging habitat. The plots are cultivated in the spring to produce a rough fallow, which is retained without the input of fertiliser or pesticides. In addition to agricultural intensification and land-use change, predation of nests and chicks contributes to wader declines, including of lapwing. By radio-tagging lapwing chicks, and using automatic radio tracking systems, the timing of chick predation can be revealed, which provides additional insights in to the importance of different predators. Lapwing chicks are predated both in the day and at night, with mammalian predators having the greatest impact. In Armenia, the population decline and loss of breeding habitats was also documented; the threats are thought to be intensification of land use and hunting, but further investigations for threat clarification are required. Cultural significance=Harvesting eggs= \\"Plover's eggs\\" were an expensive delicacy in Victorian Europe, mentioned in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited, about aristocratic British society in 1920‚Äì40. In the Netherlands, there is a cultural-historical competition to find the first peewit egg of the year (het eerste kievietsei). It is especially popular in the province Friesland, but there are also regional competitions. Gathering peewit eggs is prohibited by the European Union, but Friesland was granted an exception for cultural-historical reasons. The Frisian exception was removed in 2005 by a court, which determined that the Frisian executive councillors had not properly followed procedure. As of 2006 looking for peewit eggs is permitted between 1 March and 9 April, though harvesting the eggs is now forbidden. In 2008 the first egg was found on 3 March, in Eemnes, Utrecht, and the first egg of 2009 was found on 8 March in Krabbendijke. Over the last century, the first peewit egg has been found earlier and earlier in the year. This is ascribed to both increased use of fertiliser and climate change, causing the growth of grass needed for egg laying to occur earlier. = Mythology = The bird referred to in English translations of Ovid's Metamorphoses, book 6, as lapwing is probably the northern lapwing. Tereus is turned into an epops (6.674); Ovid presumably had the hoopoe in mind, whose crest indicates his royal status and whose long, sharp beak is a symbol of his violent nature. =In Ireland= King Philip II with a feather in his cap. The northern lapwing was declared the Republic of Ireland's national bird by a committee of the Irish Wildlife Conservancy in 1990. In the Irish language it is called pilib√≠n, \\"little Philip\\", supposedly a reference to Philip II of Spain (King of Ireland 1554‚Äì58), who often wore a feather in his cap.

An arrest is the act of apprehending and taking a person into custody (legal protection or control), usually because the person has been suspected of or observed committing a crime. After being taken into custody, the person can be questioned further and/or charged. An arrest is a procedure in a criminal justice system. Police and various other officers have powers of arrest. In some places, a citizen's arrest is permitted; for example in England and Wales, any person can arrest \\"anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing, have committed or be guilty of committing an indictable offence\\", although certain conditions must be met before taking such action. Similar powers exist in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland if a person is caught in an act of crime and not willing or able to produce valid ID. As a safeguard against the abuse of power, many countries require that an arrest must be made for a thoroughly justified reason, such as the requirement of probable cause in the United States. Furthermore, in most democracies, the time that a person can be detained in custody is relatively short (in most cases 24 hours in the United Kingdom and France and 24 or 48 hours in the United States) before the detained person must be either charged or released. Etymology American socialist activist Lucy Parsons after her arrest for rioting during an unemployment protest at Hull House in Chicago, Illinois, 1915 The word \\"arrest\\" is Anglo-Norman in origin, derived from the French word arr√™t meaning 'to stop or stay' and signifies a restraint of a person. Lexicologically, the meaning of the word arrest is given in various dictionaries depending upon the circumstances in which the word is used. There are numerous slang terms for being arrested throughout the world. In British slang terminology, the term \\"nicked\\" is often synonymous with being arrested, and \\"nick\\" can also refer to a police station, and the term \\"pinched\\" is also common.Partridge, Eric and Paul BealeA dictionary of slang and unconventional English, p. 790, 886. In the United States and France the term \\"collared\\" is sometimes used.H√©rail, Ren√© James and Edwin A. Lovatt, Dictionary of Modern Colloquial French, p. 194. The terms \\"lifted\\" or \\"picked up\\" are also heard on occasion.Partridge, Eric and Paul BealeA dictionary of slang and unconventional English, p. 681. Procedure=India= According to Indian law, formality or procedure was prescribed for making an arrest by the supreme court in D.K Basu v. the state of West Bengal in the late 90's. later on these recommended procedures or guidelines were adopted in the code of criminal procedure for the uniform application of the procedure of arrests in Section 41A, 41B and 41C. The arrest can be made by a citizen, a police officer or a Magistrate. The police officer needs to inform the person being arrested the full particulars of the person's offence and that they are entitled to be released on bail if the offence fits the criteria for being bailable. There is no general rule of eligibility or requirement that a police officer must handcuff a person who is being arrested. When there is a question regarding handcuffing a person then at that time case laws has stated that the choice to handcuff a person is dependent on the surrounding circumstances, and that officers should always take the proper precautions to ensure the safety of themselves, and the public. =United States= Distinction between arrest and detention  In the United States, there exists a distinction between an investigatory stop or detention, and an arrest. The distinction tends to be whether or not the stop is \\"brief and cursory\\" in nature, and whether or not a reasonable individual would feel free to leave.https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/terry_stop_stop_and_friskTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1(1968)U.S. v. Vargas, 369 F.3d 98 (2d Cir. 2004)In re Hoch, 82 A.3d 1167 (Vt. 2013).United States v. Bullock, 632 F.3d 1004 (7th Cir. 2011) Minor crimes and infractions A police officer arresting suspected gang members in Los Angeles, United States Police officers taking a man into custody in Chicago, United States When there exists probable cause to believe that a person has committed a minor crime, such as petty theft, driving on a suspended license, or disturbing the peace, law enforcement agents typically issue the individual a citation but do not otherwise detain them. The person must then appear in court on the date provided on the citation. Prior to the court date, the prosecution will decide whether to file formal criminal charges against the individual. When the accused appears in court, they will be advised if formal criminal charges have been filed. If charges are filed, they will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty at the initial court hearing, which is referred to as the arraignment.http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/publiced/practical/books/family/chapter_14.authcheckdam.pdf Arrests for serious crimes When a person is arrested for a serious crime, the defendant will have their picture taken and be held in pre-trial prison. Under certain circumstances (that is where the public won't be endangered by one's release from custody), the defendant may be entitled to release on bail. If the accused cannot post a monetary bail, they will appear at their arraignment where the judge will determine if the bail set by the schedule should be lowered. Also, in certain states, the prosecution has 48 hours to decide whether or not to file formal charges against the accused. For example, in California, if no formal charges are filed within the 48-hour period, the accused must be released from the arresting host's custody. If formal charges are filed, the accused will be asked to appear at their arraignment. At the arraignment, the accused will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty, and the judge will set a bail amount (or refuse to set bail) for the accused. Powers of arrest=United Kingdom=England and Wales Arrests under English law fall into two general categories‚Äîwith and without a warrant‚Äîand then into more specific subcategories. Regardless of what power a person is arrested under, they must be informed that they are under arrest and of the grounds for their arrest at the time or as soon after the arrest as is practicable, otherwise the arrest is unlawful. Northern Ireland Arrest powers in Northern Ireland are informed by the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989. This order legislates operational standards during arrest, questioning and charging a person suspected of committing a crime. Breach of this order may affect the investigation. Arrestees in Northern Ireland have the right to contact a person to inform them of an arrest, and legal representation. ScotlandArrest with a warrant A justice of the peace can issue warrants to arrest suspects and witnesses. Arrest without a warrant There are four subcategories of arrest without warrant: *under the provisions of section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE), which only applies to constables, *under the provisions of section 24A of PACE, applies to those who are not constables, *the power to arrest for a breach of the peace at common law, which applies to everyone (constable or not and includes a power of entry), and *the powers to arrest otherwise than for an offence, which apply to constables only. =United States= United States law recognizes the common law arrest under various jurisdictions. =Hong Kong= The police may arrest a person according to a warrant issued by a Magistrate under sections 31, 72, 73 or 74 of the Magistrates Ordinance. For example, an arrest warrant may be issued if an accused person does not appear in Court when he is due to answer a charge. However, an arrest warrant is not always necessary. Under section 50(1) of the Police Force Ordinance, a police officer can \\"apprehend\\" (i.e. arrest) a person if he reasonably suspects the person being arrested is guilty of an offence. Whether there is such a reasonable suspicion in a particular case is to be determined objectively by reference to facts and information which the arresting officer has at the time of the arrest. It is not necessary that the officer knows the exact statutory provision that the suspect has violated, so long as the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect has done something amounting to an offence. Warnings on arrest=United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, a person must be told that they are under arrest in simple, non-technical language, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest. A person must be 'cautioned' when being arrested or subject to a criminal prosecution procedure, unless this is impractical due to the behaviour of the arrested person. The caution required in England and Wales states, > \\"You are under arrest on suspicion of (offence). You do not have to say > anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned > something which you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given > in evidence.\\" Minor deviations from the words of any caution given do not constitute a breach of the Code of Practise, provided the sense of the caution is preserved. The caution required in Scotland states: \\"You are not obliged to say anything, but anything you do say will be noted and may be used in evidence.\\"Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 28 .Code C to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, para. 10.5. =United States= Based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Miranda v. Arizona, after making an arrest, the police must inform the detainee of their Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment rights in order for statements made during questioning to be admissible as evidence against the detainee in court. A Miranda warning is required only when a person has been taken into custody (i.e. is not free to leave) and is being interrogated, and the results of this interrogation are to be used in court. An officer is not required to inform a person of their Miranda rights if they will not be questioning them any further after their arrest. An officer is also not necessarily required to provide a Miranda warning if the person they are questioning has not been arrested or if a person they have arrested speaks spontaneously without being questioned. There is also an exception that permits questioning without providing the warning under circumstances involving urgent matters of public safety. The warning must inform the detainee that they have the right to be silent, the right to legal counsel (and the availability of pro bono legal assistance), and that what they say can be used against them. The failure to provide a detainee with an adequate warning could make information obtained from an interrogation inadmissible in court, but does not prevent other evidence from being used to obtain a conviction. As in the British system, the exact phrasing of the warning is not explicitly mandated under federal law. There are also additional requirements about the warning that vary from state to state and may depend on the circumstances (such as when the arrestee is a non-citizen or juvenile). Since the exact wording used in an arrest is legally important, police officers often carry a printed copy of the rights with them and read from it when providing the warning to ensure accuracy. =Hong Kong= Immediately after the arrest, the police must inform the arrested of their right to remain silent. They may choose whether or not to answer any questions posed by the police (except that they may need to provide their name and address to the police). The police officer will caution them by saying, > \\"You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever > you say will be put into writing and may be given in evidence.\\" Search and seizure=United Kingdom=England and WalesNon- criminal arrests=United States= Breach of a court order can be considered civil contempt of court, and a warrant for the person's arrest may be issued. Some court orders contain authority for a police officer to make an arrest without further order. If a legislature lacks a quorum, many jurisdictions allow the members present the power to order a call of the house, which orders the arrest of the members who are not present. A member arrested is brought to the body's chamber to achieve a quorum. The member arrested does not face prosecution, but may be required to pay a fine to the legislative body. Following arrest While an arrest will not necessarily lead to a criminal conviction, it may nonetheless in some jurisdictions have serious ramifications such as absence from work, social stigma, and in some cases, the legal obligation to disclose a conviction when a person applies for a job, a loan or a professional license. In the United States a person who was not found guilty after an arrest can remove their arrest record through an expungement or (in California) a finding of factual innocence. A cleared person has the choice to file a complaint or a lawsuit if they choose to. Legal action is sometimes filed against the government after a wrongful arrest. For convictions, the collateral consequences are more severe in the United States than in the UK, where arrests without conviction do not appear in standard criminal record checks and need not be disclosed, whereas in the United States, people have to expunge or (if the case goes to court) seal arrest without convictions, or if the charges are dropped. However, in the UK, Enhanced CRB disclosures permit a Chief Constable to disclose this data if they believe it relevant to the post for which the CRB disclosure was applied.

Typically presented in a cinema, newsreels were a source of current affairs, information, and entertainment for millions of moviegoers. Newsreels were typically exhibited preceding a feature film, but there were also dedicated newsreel theaters in many major cities in the 1930s and ‚Äô40s, and some large city cinemas also included a smaller theaterette where newsreels were screened continuously throughout the day. By the end of the 1960s television news broadcasts had supplanted the format. Newsreels are considered significant historical documents, since they are often the only audiovisual record of certain cultural events. History News cameramen, Washington, DC, 1938 Created in 1911 by Charles Path√©, this form of film was a staple of the typical North American, British, and Commonwealth countries (especially Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), and throughout European cinema programming schedule from the silent era until the 1960s when television news broadcasting completely supplanted its role. The National Film and Sound Archive in Australia holds the Cinesound Movietone Australian Newsreel Collection, a comprehensive collection of 4,000 newsreel films and documentaries representing news stories covering all major events. The first official British news cinema that only showed newsreels was the Daily Bioscope that opened in London on May 23, 1909. p. 56 Popple Simon & Kember, Joe Early Cinema: From Factory Gate to Dream Factory Wallflower Press 2004 In 1929, William Fox purchased a former Broadway theater called the Embassy (now a visitor center operated by the Times Square Alliance).Times Square Alliance Business Improvement District Embassy Theater He changed the format from a $2 show twice a day to a continuous 25-cent programme, establishing the first newsreel theater in the United States; the idea was such a success that Fox and his backers announced they would start a chain of newsreel theaters across the country. The newsreels were often accompanied by cartoons or short subjects. The First World War saw the major countries using the newest technologies to develop propaganda for home audiences. Each used carefully edited newsreels to combine straight news reports and propaganda.Laurent V√©ray, \\"1914‚Äì1918, the first media war of the twentieth century: The example of French newsreels.\\" Film History: An International Journal 22.4 (2010): 408-425 online.

In some countries, newsreels generally used music as a background for usually silent on-site film footage. In some countries, the narrator used humorous remarks for light-hearted or non-tragic stories. In the U.S., newsreel series included The March of Time (1935‚Äì1951), Path√© News (1910‚Äì1956), Paramount News (1927‚Äì1957), Fox Movietone News (1928‚Äì1963), Hearst Metrotone News (1914‚Äì1967), and Universal Newsreel (1929‚Äì1967). Path√© News was distributed by RKO Radio Pictures from 1931 to 1947, and then by Warner Brothers from 1947 to 1956. An example of a newsreel story can be found in the film Citizen Kane (1941), which was prepared by RKO's actual newsreel staff. Citizen Kane includes a fictional newsreel called \\"News on the March\\" that summarizes the life of title character Charles Foster Kane while parodying The March of Time. On August 12, 1949, one hundred twenty cinema technicians employed by Associated British Path√© in London went on strike to protest the dismissal of fifteen men on the grounds of redundancy while conciliation under trade union agreements was pending. Their strike lasted through to at least Tuesday August 16, the Tuesday being the last day for production on new newsreels shown on the Thursday. Events of the strike resulted in over three hundred cinemas across Britain having to go without newsreels that week. Effect of television On February 16, 1948, NBC launched a ten-minute television program called Camel Newsreel Theatre with John Cameron Swayze that featured newsreels with Swayze doing voiceovers. Also in 1948, the DuMont Television Network launched two short-lived newsreel series, Camera Headlines and I.N.S. Telenews, the latter in cooperation with Hearst's International News Service. On August 15, 1948, CBS started their evening television news program Douglas Edwards and the News. Later the NBC, CBS, and ABC(USA) news shows all produced their own news film. Newsreel cinemas either closed or went to showing continuous programmes of cartoons and short subjects, such as the London Victoria Station News Cinema, later Cartoon Cinema that opened in 1933 and closed in 1981. In New Zealand, the Weekly Review was \\"the principal film series produced in the 1940s\\". The first television news broadcasts in the country, incorporating newsreel footage, began in 1960. Newsreels died out because technological advances such as electronic news-gathering for television news, introduced in the 1970s, rendered them obsolete. Nonetheless, some countries such as Cuba, Japan, Spain, and Italy continued producing newsreels into the 1980s and 1990s.

Parts of the criminal justice system # Legislative system - network of legislatures that create laws. # Judiciary system - network of courts that interpret the law in the name of the state, and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. # Corrections system - network of governmental agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons, probation, and parole systems.Black's Law Dictionary In the 17th Century, William Penn began to promote reform in the Criminal Justice system and helped to see these changes implemented. After the American Revolution, the U.S. Constitution was created which guaranteed freedoms and rights that were never in place in colonial days. This was the starting point to setting guidelines for crimes, punishment and procedures that need to be followed to protect the rights of the innocent. Our modern system of criminal justice is the result of several evolutionary changes that society has undergone since the inception of the United States. Over the years, Americans have developed mechanisms that institute and enforce the rules of society as well as assign responsibility and punish offenders. Today, those functions are carried out by the police, the courts, and corrections. The early beginnings of the criminal justice system in the United States lacked this structure. In fact, before formal rules, laws, and institutions were established in the United States, Americans relied on religion and sin as a means of shaping society and its behaviors. Many colonial crime codes were defined in biblical terms, making offenses such as profanity, blasphemy, and sacrileges of the Sabbath highly punishable. Punishments such as dunking, stoning, and whipping were designed to humiliate the offender and ultimately lead towards their repentance. Ironically, we still see this desire to make offenders remorseful for their criminal acts but more so for the victims of crime than to a higher power.

Bail is the conditional release of a defendant with the promise to appear in court when required. In some countries, especially the United States, bail usually implies a bail bond, a deposit of money or some form of property to the court by the suspect in return for the release from pre-trial detention. If the suspect does not return to court, the bail is forfeited and the suspect may possibly be brought up on charges of the crime of failure to appear. If the suspect returns to make all their required appearances, bail is returned after the trial is concluded. In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, bail is more likely to consist of a set of restrictions that the suspect will have to abide by for a set period of time. Under this usage, bail can be given both before and after charge. For minor crimes, a defendant may be summoned to court without the need for bail. For serious crimes, or for suspects who are deemed likely to fail to turn up in court, they may be remanded (detained) while awaiting trial. A suspect is given bail in cases where remand is not justified but there is a need to provide an incentive for the suspect to appear in court. Bail amounts may vary depending on the type and severity of crime the suspect is accused of; practices for determining bail amounts vary.  Bail bond  In some countries, such as the United States and the Philippines, it is common for bail to be a cash (or other property) deposit. Known as a bail bond or cash bail, an amount of money is posted so that the suspect can be released from pre-trial detention. If the suspect makes all of their required court appearances, this deposit is refunded. In 46 US states, as well as the Philippines, a commercial bail bondsman can be paid to deposit bail money on behalf of a detained individual. This practice is illegal in the rest of the world. Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon and Wisconsin have outlawed commercial bail bonds, while New Jersey and Alaska rarely permit money bail.  Worldwide = Australia = Bail laws in Australia are similar to the laws of New Zealand, Canada and the US, but are different in each state. Each state holds that there is a prima facie entitlement to bail for most charges upon application by a defendant. However, there is an exception when the charges are especially serious, such as drug trafficking, family violence or murder. In such cases, there is no entitlement to bail, and it must be argued as to what circumstances exist that justify a grant of bail. In Victoria, bail may be refused to a defendant who faces a more serious charge unless the defendant demonstrates compelling reasons why bail should be granted. Compelling reasons may generally be established by demonstrating that jail is an unlikely outcome for the charge, or that bail conditions can be imposed that make re-offending unlikely. In cases where a defendant is charged with murder, terrorism or offending with a moderately serious charge while on bail, to become eligible for bail the defendant must prove exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances is difficult to demonstrate, but may potentially arise as a consequence of significant delay in a criminal prosecution. = Canada = Just as in the United States, people charged with a criminal offence in Canada have a constitutional right to reasonable bail unless there is some compelling reason to deny it. These reasons can be related to the accused's likelihood to skip bail, or to public danger resulting from the accused being at large. In stark contrast to many other jurisdictions granting a constitutional right to bail, in Canada the accused may even be denied bail because the public confidence in the administration of justice may be disturbed by letting the individual, still legally innocent, go free pending the completion of the trial or passing of sentence (Criminal Code, s. 515 (10)(c)). Sureties and deposits can be imposed, but are optional. = Czech Republic = Notable Czech bail cases *Radovan Krejƒç√≠≈ô **charged with fraud (2004) **bail denied, following Krejƒç√≠≈ô's complaint bail set at CZK 40 million (~ ‚Ç¨ 1.6 million), then denied by appellate court following state prosecutor's complaint *David Rath **charged with accepting bribe (2012) **bail set at CZK 14 million (~ ‚Ç¨ 560,000) *Michal Hala **charged with accepting bribe (2012) **bail set at CZK 4 million (~ ‚Ç¨160,000), but denied and returned by appellate court following prosecutor's complaint *Randy Blythe (Google Translate link) (Google Translate link) **charged with intentionally inflicting bodily harm which resulted in death (i.e. manslaughter) (2012) **bail set at CZK 4 million, then doubled by appellate court following prosecutor's complaint *Robert Rosenberg **charged with procuring prostitution, trafficking (2008) **bail set at CZK 600,000 (~ ‚Ç¨24,000) Instead of remand, a court in the Czech Republic may decide to accept: *a guaranty from a trustworthy person or association *a written word of honor from the person charged *surveillance by a probation officer *bail Bail can be considered when a charged person is held because of concern of possible escape or of a continuation of criminal activity. Bail cannot be considered where there is a concern of influencing witnesses or otherwise frustrating of the proceedings. Bail is also excluded in case of 31 specified serious crimes (e.g. murder, grievous bodily harm, rape, robbery, public endangerment, etc.) when the person is held due to concern of continuation of criminal activity. Bail may be posted either by the charged person, or with his or her consent, by a third party, but this only after this third party has received a thorough briefing regarding the charges and reasons for custody and possible grounds for the forfeiture of the bail. After the bail has been posted, the court must again review the grounds for bail, and must decide either to accept or refuse the bail. When accepting the bail, the court may also require the charged person to stay in the country. The court may decide to rescind the bail if the charged person * escapes, is in hiding or fails to report a change of address and thus frustrates the possibility of delivery of summons or other documents from the court, the prosecution or the police, or * is at fault for failing to appear for a proceeding, which may not take part without him or her, or * continues criminal activity, or attempts to finish the crime which he or she had attempted or threatened previously, or * is evading execution of imprisonment sentence, court ordered fine or other court ordered punishment. The court holds out on bail as long as the reasons for custody remain (which includes pending of the charges), and in case of conviction until the convict starts serving prison sentence, reimburses the criminal proceedings and/or pays court ordered fine. In case that the court decided also on damages and the aggrieved party asks for it within three months, the bail or its part may be used also to reimburse the damages. Otherwise, the court returns the bail. Both the prosecutor and the person in custody may challenge any decision on custody (including bail) by filing a complaint which leads to review by an appellate court. = England and Wales = History  In medieval England, the sheriffs originally possessed the sovereign authority to release or hold suspected criminals. Some sheriffs would exploit the bail for their own gain. The Statute of Westminster (1275) limited the discretion of sheriffs with respect to the bail. Although sheriffs still had the authority to fix the amount of bail required, the statute stipulates which crimes are bailable and which are not. In the early 17th century, King Charles I ordered noblemen to issue him loans. Those who refused were imprisoned. Five of the prisoners filed a habeas corpus petition arguing that they should not be held indefinitely without trial or bail. In the Petition of Right (1628) Parliament argued that the King had flouted Magna Carta by imprisoning people without just cause. The Habeas Corpus Act 1679 states, \\"A Magistrate shall discharge prisoners from their Imprisonment taking their Recognizance, with one or more Surety or Sureties, in any Sum according to the Magistrate's discretion, unless it shall appear that the Party is committed for such Matter or offences for which by law the Prisoner is not bailable.\\" The English Bill of Rights (1689) states that \\"excessive bail hath been required of persons committed in criminal cases, to elude the benefit of the laws made for the liberty of the subjects. Excessive bail ought not to be required.\\" This was a precursor of the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution. The Bail Act 1976 was enacted with the aims of creating more conditions by which defendants could be denied bail and also redefining the parameters of fulfilling bail. The legislation outlined that courts were obliged to offer bail to defendants unless a specific exception was met. The first of two known exceptions was that the defendant would not willingly surrender and tamper with case evidence; the second was that insufficient case evidence had been collected to allow a defendant to be granted bail. The act also nullified the recognizance system, removing the requirement of paying a specific amount of money and instead arresting defendants for failing to surrender. Many historians have observed a dilemma in which the 1976 Bail Act granted greater power to the courts in handling custody but also pushed them to not put defendants in custody unnecessarily. Legal commentator Susanne Bell notes that the act failed to incur universal legal promotion, instead only allowing defendants to be provided legal aid after they have been reprimanded. Bell believes that this, among other minor flaws, flawed the legislation, but it was nonetheless a springboard for other practical applications. As a partial amendment to the 1976 Bail Act, the Criminal Justice Act 2003 stipulates that bail must be denied to defendants who test positive for Class A drugs outlined in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and refuse to be assessed or refuse to participate in recommended treatment.  Forms  In England and Wales there are three types of bail that can be given:\\"Bail Conditions\\", Dorset Police. Retrieved 30 December 2008. * Police bail. A suspect is released without being charged but must return to the police station at a stated time. * Police to court. After being charged, a suspect is given bail but must attend their first court hearing at the date and Court stated. * Court bail. After a court hearing, a suspect is granted bail pending further investigation or while the case continues.  By police before charge  Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, a police officer of inspector rank or higher has power to release a person who has not been charged on bail. This is deemed to be a release on bail in accordance with sections 3, 3A, 5 and 5A of the Bail Act 1976.Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 34 (5). (Before the Policing and Crime Act 2017 came into force, the arresting officer had this power, but now a suspect must normally be released without bail or charged.) This so-called \\"police bail\\" lasts 28 days (or 3 months in Serious Fraud Office cases), after which the suspect is required to report to a specified police station, where he may be charged or released. (Before the above- mentioned 2017 Act, the police had the power to extend bail for 28 days at a time arbitrarily many times, leading to some cases of people effectively being punished by restriction of liberty without due process for over a year before their case was dropped.) If he is released after bail, an extended period of bail may only be imposed once by a superintendent officer up to 3 months (except in SFO cases). In \\"exceptionally complex\\" cases, particularly those involving the Financial Conduct Authority or Serious Fraud Office, the period may further be extended by an appropriate decision maker (an officer of the FCA or SFO, if applicable, or otherwise a police commander or assistant chief constable) up to 6 months, subject to representations from the suspect. After that, further extensions of bail, up to 6 months at a time, require a warrant to be issued by a magistrates' court. The bail period is suspended for any day when the suspect is in hospital as an in-patient. Police bail may be subject to conditions for the following purposes: However, they may not require a recognizance, surety or security (i.e. money either paid on release or promised, perhaps by a third party, in the event of breaching the other conditions or absconding), or require residence in a bail hostel.Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 s.30A(3A)  By police after charge  After a person has been charged, he must ordinarily be released, on bail or without bail.Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 38 Exceptions to this include: *Difficulty to ascertain a real name or address. *Reasonable grounds for believing that the person arrested will fail to appear in court to answer to bail. *In the case of a person arrested for an imprisonable offence, the custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the detention of the person arrested is necessary to prevent him from committing an offence. *In the case of a person arrested for an offence which is not an imprisonable offence, the custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the detention of the person arrested is necessary to prevent him from causing physical injury to any other person or from causing loss of or damage to property. *The custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the detention of the person arrested is necessary to prevent him from interfering with the administration of justice or with the investigation of offences or of a particular offence. *The custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that the detention of the person arrested is necessary for his own protection. But in the case of an arrested juvenile the exceptions include circumstances where: the custody officer has reasonable grounds for believing that he ought to be detained in his own interests. *the offence with which the person is charged is murder or treason.Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, section 25  By a court = Rights = Under current law, a defendant has an absolute right to bail if the custody time limits have expired and otherwise ordinarily a right to bail unless there is sufficient reason not to grant it.Bail Act 1976, Schedule 1 Any person accused of committing a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Therefore, a person charged with a crime should not be denied freedom unless there is a good reason. The main reasons for refusing bail are that the defendant is accused of an imprisonable offence and there are substantial grounds for believing that the defendant would: # Abscond # Commit further offences while on bail # Interfere with witnesses The court should take into account the: # Nature and seriousness of the offence or default (and the probable method of dealing with the defendant for it) # Character, antecedents, associations and community ties of the defendant, # Defendant's bail record, and # Strength of the evidence The court may also refuse bail: * For the defendant's own protection * Where the defendant is already serving a custodial sentence for another offence * Where the court is satisfied that it has not been practicable to obtain sufficient information * Where the defendant has already absconded in the present proceedings * Where the defendant has been convicted but the court is awaiting a pre-sentence report, other report or inquiry and it would be impracticable to complete the inquiries or make the report without keeping the defendant in custody * Where the defendant is charged with a non-imprisonable offence, has already been released on bail for the offence with which he is now accused, and has been arrested for absconding or breaching bail Where the accused has previous convictions for certain homicide or sexual offences, the burden of proof is on the defendant to rebut a presumption against bail.Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, section 25; R v Crown Court at Harrow [2006] UKHL 42 The Criminal Justice Act 2003 amended the Bail Act 1976 restricting the right to bail for adults who tested positive for a Class A drug and refused to be assessed or refused to participate in recommended treatment. Where a defendant is charged with treason, bail may only be granted by a High Court judge or by the Secretary of State.Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, section 41 Section 115 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 prohibits magistrates' courts from granting bail in murder cases. = Conditions = Conditions may be applied to the grant of bail, such as living at a particular address or having someone act as surety, if the court considers that this is necessary: * To prevent the defendant absconding * To prevent the defendant committing further offences while on bail * To prevent the defendant interfering with witnesses * For the defendant's own protection (or if he is a child or young person, for his own welfare or in his own interests) = Failure to comply = Failing to attend court on time as required is an offence, for which the maximum sentence in a magistrates' court is three months' imprisonment, or twelve months in the Crown Court.Bail Act 1976, section 6(7) (Sentences are usually much shorter than the maximum, but are often custodial.) In addition to imposing punishment for this offence, courts will often revoke bail as they may not trust the defendant again. The amended Consolidated Criminal Practice Direction states (at paragraph 1.13.5) that \\"the sentence for the breach of bail should usually be custodial and consecutive to any other custodial sentence\\". Failing to comply with bail conditions is not an offence, but may lead to the defendant being arrested and brought back to court, where they will be remanded into custody unless the court is satisfied that they will comply with their conditions in the future. = India = Indian law stresses the principles of presumption of innocence. The principle embodies freedom from arbitrary detention and serves as a bulwark against punishment before conviction. More importantly, it prevents the State from successfully employing its vast resources to cause greater damage to an un-convicted accused than he/she can inflict on society. While considering bail applications of the accused, courts are required to balance considerations of personal liberty with public interest. Accordingly, the granting of bail should be the rule rather than the exception. The Supreme Court has laid down in its judgements, \\"Personal liberty, deprived when bail is refused, is too precious a value of our constitutional system recognized under Article 21 that the crucial power to negate it is a great trust exercisable, not casually but judicially, with lively concern for the cost to the individual and community. To glamorize impressionistic orders as discretionary may, on occasions, make a litigation gamble decisive of a fundamental right. After all, the personal liberty of an accused or convict is fundamental, suffering lawful eclipse only in terms of procedure established by law.\\" The courts have also held that foreign nationals cannot be deprived of the right to seek bail. The Delhi High Court observed, \\"Law does not permit any differentiation between Indian Nationals and Foreign citizens in the matter of granting bail. What is permissible is that, considering the facts and circumstances of each case, the court can impose different conditions which are necessary to ensure that the accused will be available for facing the trial. It cannot be said that an accused will not be granted bail because he is a foreign national.\\" The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 does not define bail, although the terms bailable offence and non-bailable offence have been defined in section 2(a) of the Code. A Bailable offence is defined as an offence which is shown as bailable in the First Schedule of the Code or which is made bailable by any other law, and non- bailable offence means any other offence. A person who is arrested for a 'bailable' offence may secure bail at the police station, while those who fail to secure police bail and those arrested for non-bailable offences have to secure bail in court. Sections 436 to 450 set out the provisions for the grant of bail and bonds in criminal cases. The amount of security that is to be paid by the accused to secure his release has not been mentioned in the Code. Thus, it is left to the discretion of the court to put a monetary cap on the bond. The Supreme Court of India has delivered several cases wherein it has reiterated that the basic rule is ‚Äì bail and not jail. One such instance came in State Of Rajasthan, Jaipur v. Balchand @ Bailey which the Supreme Court decided on 20 September 1977, and held that the basic rule is bail, not jail, except where there are circumstances suggestive of fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like by the petitioner who seeks enlargement on bail from the court. The bench of Krishnaiyer, V.R. had observed that when considering the question of bail, the gravity of the offence involved and the heinousness of the crime which are likely to induce the petitioner to avoid the course of justice must weigh with the court. Taking into consideration the facts of the case the apex court held that the circumstances and the social milieu do not militate against the petitioner being granted bail.State of Rajasthan, Jaipur v. Balchand, AIR 1977 SC 2447. When a person accused of a crime is arrested, his statement is recorded and information such as the name, residence address, birthplace, charges filed are noted. The police officer may also check back the criminal record if any in the police station and ask for fingerprints to file a case against the accused. Under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (First Schedule), offences have been classified as \\"bailable\\" and \\"non-bailable\\" offences. In the case of bailable offences, if the accused produces proper surety, and fulfils other conditions, it is binding upon the Investigating officer to grant bail. However, in case of a non-bailable offence, the police cannot grant bail; it can only be granted by a Judicial Magistrate/Judge. The Investigating Officer must produce the accused before the Judicial Magistrate/Judge concerned within 24 hours of his arrest. At that time, the accused has a right to apply for bail. Depending upon the facts of the case, the judge decides whether bail should be granted. If bail is granted the accused must deposit money with the court. Generally, for lesser crimes, a standard amount is asked to be deposited for awarding the bail. There are some conditions put under section 437 of the Cr.P.C. wherein bail can be requested even for a non-bailable offence. In non-bailable cases, bail is not the right of the accused, but the discretion of the judge if regards the case as fit for the grant of bail, it regards imposition of certain conditions as necessary in the circumstances. Section 437(3) elaborates the conditions set by the law to get bail in non- bailable offences. The sub-section says that when a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offense punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or of an offense under Chapter VI, Chapter XVI or Chapter XVII of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) or abatement of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit, any such offense, is released on bail under sub-section (1). However, for that, the Court has the power to impose any condition which it considers necessary. Some conditions that the court may place while granting bail are to ensure that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed under this Chapter, or to ensure that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused or of the commission of which he is suspected, or otherwise in the interests of justice. = New Zealand = Like Canada and the United States, those charged with a criminal offence have a right to be released on bail with reasonable terms and conditions, unless there is a good reason for continuing to be held in custody. When one is arrested the police decide whether to grant the person bail until their court date. After that the courts will have discretion whether to grant bail again, if the case is not resolved at the first court appearance. When considering granting bail, the police and courts take into consideration factors such as: the persons likelihood of showing up to court, the nature of the offence, the persons past conduct, whether the person will offend again while out on bail, and the risk of evidence/witnesses being tampered with. Certain offences (such as violence, drug-dealing, or repeat offenders) automatically disqualify persons from being granted bail. People who have previously breached their bail or the conditions associated with it are less likely to be granted bail again. =Republic of Ireland= In the Republic of Ireland, bail (, from Old Norse band, \\"binding\\") is when a person enters a written bond (recognisance), committing to appear before the court to answer the charges made against them.https://beta.courts.ie/what-bail-and-how-does-it-work A person may be required to lodge money as part of their bail. A surety is a person who makes themselves responsible for a prisoner coming to court. They promise to pay a sum of money to the court if the prisoner does not appear as agreed; however, commercial bail bonding as in the U.S. is illegal.https://www.iprt.ie/site/assets/files/6383/ptd_country_report_ireland_final_updated.pdf There are three kinds of bail: *Station bail: set by a Garda S√≠och√°na. A common condition is that the prisoner must report to his/her local Garda station once or several times a day. *Court bail: set by the judge in the District Court. The prisoner (or his/her surety) must pay the court at least one-third of the amount of money promised in the bail bond. *High Court bail: if the prisoner is charged with a very serious crime, only the High Court can grant bail. In People (AG) v O'Callaghan (1966), the Irish Supreme Court had ruled that the provisions of Article 40.4 of the Irish Constitution, which guarantees personal liberty and the principle of habeas corpus, meant that an individual charged with a crime could only be refused bail if they were likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. The Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, approved by referendum in 1996, provided that a court could refuse bail to a suspect where it feared that while at liberty they would commit a serious criminal offence. The Bail Act 1997 was passed by the Oireachtas the following year, and it governs bail in the Republic. = Scotland = Bail can be granted by any of courts of Scotland, with the final decision in solemn proceedings being with the High Court of Justiciary. All crimes are bailable, and bail should be granted to any accused person \\"except where there is good reason for refusing bail\\". The Bail, Judicial Appointments etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, an Act of the Scottish Parliament, had removed the previous restrictions on bail that meant that murder and treason were not ordinarily bailable. However, a person could be bailed when accused of these of crimes on application of the Lord Advocate or by a decision of the High Court itself. The Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 reintroduced restrictions on the granting of bail by requiring exceptional circumstances to be shown when a person is accused of a violent, sexual or drugs offence, and they have a prior conviction for a similar offence. In Scotland, the focus is normally for those who are opposed to bail to convince the courts that bail should not be granted, with the procurator fiscal given guidance to use the nature and gravity of an offence as grounds to oppose bail. A person who is refused bail can appeal against the refusal to either the Sheriff Appeal Court for summary proceedings in the Sheriff Courts and Justice of the Peace Courts and solemn proceedings in the Sheriff Courts, or to the High Court of Justiciary when a case is on trial there. The High Court of Justiciary has final authority to decide all bail decisions, and will decide on bail appeals for cases before the High Court on first instance. A Procurator Fiscal or Advocate Depute can request the High Court to review any bail decision where they believe that bail should not have been granted. = United States = Bail bondsman in Longview, Texas. The 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution states, \\"Excessive bail shall not be required\\", thus establishing bail as a constitutionally-protected right. What constitutes \\"excessive\\" is a matter of judicial discretion, and bail can be denied if the judge feels that it will not aid in forcing the accused back to trial. Money bail is the most common form of bail in the United States and the term \\"bail\\" often specifically refers to such a deposit, but other forms of pre-trial release are permitted; this varies by state. Many states have a \\"bail schedule\\" that lists the recommended bail amount for a given criminal charge. At the first court appearance (the arraignment), the judge can set the bail at the amount listed on the schedule or at a different amount based on the specific facts of the crime and the person accused. A common criticism of bail in the United States is that a suspect's likelihood of being released is significantly affected by their economic statusShalom, Alexander. \\"Bail Reform as a Mass Incarceration Reduction Technique\\".

In response, in 2014 New Jersey and Alaska have abolished cash bail for all but a limited number of court cases, while California was to abolish cash bail entirely with effect from October 2019. The California ballot proposition will only go into effect if it is approved by voters in the November 2020 election.. In California bail is heavily regulated by the California Penal Code, California Insurance Code and California Code of Regulations. All violations of the aforementioned constitute felony violations via California Insurance Code 1814 - including administrative regulatory codes such as record keeping, how solicitations are conducted, collateral and treatment of arrestees. Under California law it is a crime for a bail bondsman to solicit business at a county jail. =France= In France, bail may be ordered by the examining magistrate or the judge of freedoms and detention within the framework of Judicial control in law French (before the trial).

In a civil state, authority is made formal by way of a judicial branch and an executive branch of government.The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought Third Edition, Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds. p.115. In the exercise of governance, the terms authority and power are inaccurate synonyms. The term authority identifies the political legitimacy, which grants and justifies the ruler‚Äôs right to exercise power of government; and the term power identifies the ability to accomplish an authorized goal, either by compliance or by obedience; hence, authority is the power to make decisions and the legitimacy to make such legal decisions and order their execution.The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought Third Edition, Allan Bullock and Stephen Trombley, Eds. p.677‚Äì678.  History  Ancient understandings of authority trace back to Rome and draw later from Catholic (Thomistic) thought and other traditional understandings. In more modern terms, forms of authority include transitional authority exhibited in for example Cambodia, public authority in the form of popular power, and, in more administrative terms, bureaucratic or managerial techniques. In terms of bureaucratic governance, one limitation of the governmental agents of the executive branch, as outlined by George A. Krause, is that they are not as close to the popular will as elected representatives are. The claims of authority can extend to national or individual sovereignty, which is broadly or provisionally understood as a claim to political authority that is legitimated. Historical applications of authority in political terms include the formation of the city-state of Geneva, and experimental treatises involving the topic of authority in relation to education include Emile by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. As David Laitin defines, authority is a key concept to be defined in determining the range and role of political theory, science and inquiry. The relevance of a grounded understanding of authority includes the basic foundation and formation of political, civil and/or ecclesiastical institutions or representatives. In recent years, however, authority in political contexts has been challenged or questioned.  Political philosophy  There have been several contributions to the debate of political authority. Among others, Hannah Arendt, Carl Joachim Friedrich, Thomas Hobbes, Alexandre Koj√®ve and Carl Schmitt have provided some of the most remarkable texts. In political philosophy, the jurisdiction of political authority, the location of sovereignty, the balancing of freedom and authority, and the requirements of political obligations have been core questions from the time of Plato and Aristotle to the present. Most democratic societies are engaged in an ongoing discussion regarding the legitimate extent of the exercise of governmental authority. In the United States, for instance, there is a prevailing belief that the political system as instituted by the Founding Fathers should accord the populace as much freedom as reasonable, and that government should limit its authority accordingly, known as limited government. In the discussion regarding the legitimacy of political authority, there are two beliefs at the respective ends of the spectrum. The first is the belief in the absolute freedom of the individual, otherwise known as political anarchism. The second is the belief that there must be a central authority in the form of a sovereign that claims ownership and control over the masses. This belief is known as statism. Sovereignty, in modern terms, can refer either to the adherence to a form of sovereign rule or the individual sovereignty, or autonomy, of a nation-state. The argument for political anarchy and anti- statism is made by Michael Huemer in his book The Problem of Political Authority. On the other side, one of the main arguments for the legitimacy of the state is some form of the ‚Äúsocial contract theory‚Äù developed by Thomas Hobbes in his 1668 book, Leviathan, or by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his political writings on the social contract.  Sociology  Since the emergence of the social sciences, authority has become a subject of research in a variety of empirical settings: the family (parental authority), small groups (informal authority of leadership), intermediate organizations such as schools, churches, armies, industries and bureaucracies (organizational and bureaucratic authority), and society-wide or inclusive organizations, ranging from the most primitive tribal society to the modern nation-state and intermediate organization (political authority). The definition of authority in contemporary social science remains a matter of debate. Max Weber in his essay \\"Politics as a Vocation\\" (1919) divided legitimate authority into three types. Others, like Howard Bloom, suggest a parallel between authority and respect/reverence for ancestors.  United Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms  The political authority in the British context can be traced to James VI and I of Scotland who wrote two political treatise called Basilikon Doron and The Trve Lawe of free Monarchies: Or, The Reciprock and Mvtvall Dvtie Betwixt a free King, and his naturall Subiectes which advocated his right to rule on the basis of the concept of the divine right of kings, a theological concept that has basis in multiple religions, but in this case, Christianity, tracing this right to the apostolic succession. The King in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth states are considered the foundations of judicial, legislative and executive authority.  United States  The understanding of political authority and the exercise of political powers in the American context traces back to the writings of the Founding Fathers, including the arguments put forward in The Federalist Papers by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and the First Chief Justice of the United States John Jay, and later speeches by the 16th President of the United States Abraham Lincoln. \\"Our government rests in public opinion,\\" President Abraham Lincoln said in 1856. In his 1854 Speech at Peoria, Illinois, Lincoln espoused \\"the proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases with all which is exclusively his own,\\" a principle existing \\"at the foundation of the sense of justice.\\" This sense of personal ownership and stewardship was integral to the practice of self-government as Abraham Lincoln saw it by a Republican nation and its people. This was because, as Abraham Lincoln also declared, \\"No man is good enough to govern another man, without that other's consent.\\" The U.S. President is called to give account to the Parliament for the conduct of the whole government, including that of regulatory agencies. The President influence the appointments, the budgeting process and has the right and capacity to review regulatory rules on case-by-case basis. Since the time of the Reagan administration the President was informed with a cost‚Äìbenefit analysis of the regulation. The creation of a regulatory agency requires an act of the Congress which specifies its jurisdiction, the related authority and delegated powers. Regulatory authorities can be qualified as independent agencies or executive branch agencies, a choice which is reason of struggle between the Congress and the President as well as with the American Courts. The latter's role is limited by the authorities' power to regulate property rights without the due process rights mandatorily applied by the courts.

They came from M Polonceau's stud in France to the property of the Riley family of Raby, New South Wales. Pure bred Angoras were imported from Ottoman Empire in subsequent years up to 1873, to properties in New South Wales, Victoria, and later South Australia. Other states followed and there were importations from South Africa in 1873 and from USA between 1890 and 1910. =Introduction to New Zealand= Angora goats were introduced to New Zealand in approximately 1867 by the Auckland, Canterbury and Otago acclimatisation societies in an attempt to farm animals with more valuable skins. Angora goats initially struggled to gain a foothold but were unsuccessfully trialed for weed-control purposes at Maungaturoto in 1904 and, following escapes, a feral population established at Waipu while a government herd was established at Helena Bay. In the 1970s numbers of the Waipu feral Angoras were captured and used as base animals for a Government initiative aimed at broadening NZ's agricultural base. These Angoras were initially improved with Australian genetics. In the mid 1980s imports from South Africa and Texan genetics (via Australia) were used to further improve the New Zealand Angora. =Introduction to South Africa= In 1838, Sultan Mahmud II of Ottoman Empire sent twelve neutered rams and one female to Port Elizabeth in South Africa. The rams were rendered infertile as the Sultan wanted to protect his country's powerful mohair empire. However, the ewe on board was pregnant and gave birth to a kid ram en route to Africa, which was the start of the industry in South Africa. Today's Karoo region produces the most mohair in the world. Shortly after the early importations to establish the Angora in the Cape Colony, many later importations were made for money making ventures. The most notable, was Evans, a farmer from Angora that imported Angora Goats with a much oilier fleece and played a role in the growing mohair market as they later sold for as much as ‚Ç¨450. =Introduction to North America= Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan Abd√ºlmecid I in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton. More goats were imported over time, until the Civil War destroyed most of the large flocks in the south. Eventually, Angora goats began to thrive in the southwest, particularly in Texas, wherever there are sufficient grasses and shrubs to sustain them. Texas to this day remains the largest mohair producer in the U.S., and third largest in the world. Characteristics Angora goats are normally white, but colored Angoras are growing in popularity The fleece taken from an Angora goat is called mohair. A single goat produces between four and five kilograms of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year. Angoras, despite their coats, are not directly related to sheep. Turkey, Argentina, the United States, and South Africa are the top producers of mohair. Secondary producers include New Zealand and Australia. For a long time, Angora goats were bred for their white coats. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Now, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fibers. Angora goats are more susceptible to external parasites (ectoparasites) than similar animals, as their coats are denser. They are not prolific breeders, nor are they considered very hardy, being particularly delicate during the first few days of life. Further, Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor-quality diet will curtail mohair development.

Over his seven-decade career, Cale has worked in various styles across rock, drone, classical, avant-garde and electronic music. He studied music at Goldsmiths College, University of London, before relocating in 1963 to New York City's downtown music scene, where he performed as part of the Theatre of Eternal Music and formed the Velvet Underground. Since leaving the band in 1968, Cale has released 16 solo studio albums, including the widely acclaimed Music for a New Society. Cale has also acquired a reputation as an adventurous producer, working on the debut albums of several innovative artists, including the Stooges and Patti Smith. Early life and career John Davies Cale was born on 9 March 1942 in Garnant in the industrial Amman Valley of Wales to Will Cale, a coal miner, and Margaret Davies, a primary school teacher.Mitchell, Tim Sedition and Alchemy: A Biography of John Cale, 2003, p. 24 Although his father spoke only English, his mother spoke and taught Welsh to Cale, which hindered his relationship with his father, although he began learning English at primary school, at around the age of seven. Cale was molested by two different men during his youth, an Anglican priest who molested him in a church and a music teacher.Cold, Black Style: The John Cale Interview, markmordue.com; accessed 3 January 2018. Having discovered a talent for viola, Cale studied music at Goldsmiths College, University of London. While he was there he organised an early Fluxus concert, A Little Festival of New Music, on 6 July 1964. He also contributed to the short film Police Car and had two scores published in Fluxus Preview Review (July 1963) for the nascent avant-garde collective. He conducted the first performance in the UK of Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra, with the composer and pianist Michael Garrett as soloist. In 1963, he travelled to the United States to continue his musical training with the assistance and influence of Aaron Copland. Upon arriving in New York City, Cale met a number of influential composers. On 9 September 1963 he participated, along with John Cage and several others, in an 18-hour piano- playing marathon that was the first full-length performance of Erik Satie's \\"Vexations\\". After the performance Cale appeared on the television panel show I've Got a Secret. Cale's secret was that he had performed in an 18-hour concert, and he was accompanied by Karl Schenzer, whose secret was that he was the only member of the audience who had stayed for the duration. Cale would later attribute Cage's writings with his own \\"relaxed\\" artistic outlook, having hitherto been raised to believe that European composers were obliged to justify their work. Cale also played in La Monte Young's ensemble the Theatre of Eternal Music, also known as the Dream Syndicate (not to be confused with the 1980s band of the same name). The heavily drone-laden music he played there proved to be a big influence in his work with his next band, the Velvet Underground. One of his collaborators on these recordings was the Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison. Three albums of his early experimental work from this period were released in 2001. The Velvet Underground (1964‚Äì1968) Belying his background in art music and the avant- garde, Cale had enjoyed and followed rock music from a young age; on a visit to Britain in 1965, he procured records by the Kinks, the Who and Small Faces that remained unavailable in the United States. Early that year, he co-founded the Velvet Underground with Lou Reed, recruiting his flatmate Angus MacLise and Reed's college friend Sterling Morrison to complete the initial line-up. Just before the band's first paying gig for $75 at Summit High School in New Jersey, MacLise abruptly quit the band because he viewed accepting money for art as selling out; he was replaced by Maureen Tucker as the band's drummer. Initially hired to play that one show, she soon became a permanent member and her tribal pounding style became an integral part of the band's music, despite the initial objections of Cale to the band having a female drummer. On his aforementioned visit to Britain in the summer of 1965, Cale shopped a crudely- recorded, acoustic-based Velvet Underground demo reel to several luminaries in the British rock scene (including Marianne Faithfull) with the intention of securing a record deal. Although this failed to manifest, the tape was disseminated throughout the UK underground over the following eighteen months by such figures as producer Joe Boyd and Mick Farren of the Deviants. As a result, the Deviants, the Yardbirds and David Bowie had all covered Velvet Underground songs prior to the release of their debut album in 1967. The very first commercially available recording of the Velvet Underground, an instrumental track called \\"Loop\\" given away with Aspen Magazine, was a feedback experiment written and conducted by Cale. His creative relationship with Reed was integral to the sound of the Velvet Underground's first two albums, The Velvet Underground & Nico (recorded in 1966, released in 1967) and White Light/White Heat (recorded in 1967, released in 1968). On these albums he plays viola, bass guitar and piano, and sings occasional backing vocals. White Light/White Heat also features Cale on organ (on \\"Sister Ray\\") as well as two vocal turns: \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\", an experimental song where he shares lead vocal duties with Reed, and \\"The Gift\\", a long spoken word piece written by Reed. Though Cale co-wrote the music to several songs, his most distinctive contribution is the electrically-amplified viola. He also played celesta on \\"Sunday Morning\\". Cale also played on Nico's 1967 debut album, Chelsea Girl, which includes songs co-written by Velvet Underground members Cale, Reed and Morrison, who also appear as musicians. Cale makes his debut as lyricist on \\"Winter Song\\" and \\"Little Sister\\". Apart from appearing on the Velvet Underground's first two albums, he also played organFricke, David. Liner notes to the Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition CD, 1997 on the track \\"Ocean\\" during the practice sessions to produce demos for the band's fourth album Loaded, nearly two years after he left the band. He was enticed back into the studio by the band's manager, Steve Sesnick, \\"in a half-hearted attempt to reunite old comrades\\", as Cale put it.Fricke, David. Liner notes to the Peel Slowly and See box set, 1995 Although he does not appear on the finished album, the demo recording of \\"Ocean\\" was included in the 1997 Loaded: Fully Loaded Edition CD re-issue. Finally, five previously unreleased tracks recorded in late 1967 and early 1968 were included on the albums VU (1985) and Another View (1986). With tensions between Reed and Cale growing, Reed gave an ultimatum to Morrison and Tucker, declaring that unless Cale was fired, he would quit the band. Morrison and Tucker reluctantly went along with the scheme. In September 1968, Cale played his final gig with the Velvet Underground at the Boston Tea Party and according to Tucker, \\"When John left, it was really sad. I felt really bad. And of course, this was gonna really influence the music, 'cause, John's a lunatic (laughs). I think we became a little more normal, which was fine, it was good music, good songs, it was never the same though. It was good stuff, a lot of good songs, but, just, the lunacy factor was... gone.\\" After his dismissal from the band, Cale was replaced by Boston-based musician Doug Yule, who played bass guitar, keyboards and who would soon share lead vocal duties in the band with Reed. Michael Carlucci, who was friends with Robert Quine, has given this explanation about Cale's dismissal, \\"Lou told Quine that the reason why he had to get rid of Cale in the band was Cale's ideas were just too out there. Cale had some wacky ideas. He wanted to record the next album with the amplifiers underwater, and [Lou] just couldn't have it. He was trying to make the band more accessible.\\" Arguably, the artistic frictions between Cale and Reed are what shaped the band's early sound much more than any other members. The pair often had heated disagreements about the direction of the band, and this tension was central to their later collaborations. When Cale left, he seemed to take the more experimental tendencies with him, as is noticeable in comparing the proto- noise rock of White Light/White Heat (which Cale co-created) to the comparatively dulcet, folk rock-influenced The Velvet Underground, recorded after his departure. Cale would later compare the dissonance he used in his VU compositions with the indecipherable lyricism of some contemporary southern US rap music: \\"If I can use out-of-tune stuff, [rappers] don‚Äôt need words to make sense. There‚Äôs definitely a lineage\\". Solo career=1970s= After leaving the Velvet Underground, Cale worked as a record producer and arranger on a number of albums, most notably the Stooges' highly influential 1969 self- titled debut and a trilogy by Nico, including The Marble Index (1969), Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974). On these he accompanied Nico's voice and harmonium using a wide array of instruments to unusual effect. While meeting with Joe Boyd (who co-produced Desertshore), he came across Nick Drake's music and insisted on collaborating with the fledgling artist. He appeared on Drake's second album, Bryter Layter, playing viola and harpsichord on \\"Fly\\" and piano, organ, and celesta on \\"Northern Sky\\". In addition to working as a producer, Cale initiated a solo recording career in early 1970. His first studio album, Vintage Violence, is a lushly-produced roots rock effort indebted to a range of disparate influences, including the Band, Leonard Cohen, the Byrds, Phil Spector and Brian Wilson. The more experimental Church of Anthrax (a collaboration with minimal music pioneer Terry Riley) followed in February 1971, although it was actually recorded nearly a year prior to its release. While his explorations in art music briefly continued with 1972's The Academy in Peril, he would not compose in the classical mode thereafter until he began working on film soundtracks in the 1980s. In 1972, he signed with au courant Reprise Records as a recording artist and staff producer. The Academy in Peril was his first project for Reprise. The subsequent Paris 1919 (1973) steered back towards the singer-songwriter mode of Vintage Violence with a backing band that included Lowell George of Little Feat and Wilton Felder of the Crusaders. Composed of highly melodic songs with arcane and complex lyrics, it has been cited by critics as one of his best. While affiliated with the label, he produced albums by Jennifer Warnes (her third, Jennifer), Chunky, Novi & Ernie, and the self-titled debut of the Modern Lovers, which Reprise chose not to release; it subsequently appeared on Beserkley Records, the latest in a series of important Cale-produced proto- punk records. In 1974 he joined Island Records, working on albums with a variety of artists, including Squeeze, Patti Smith and Sham 69. He worked as a talent scout with Island's A&R; department. 1974‚Äì1979 Cale performing live in Toronto, Canada, 1977In 1974, Cale moved back to London. As his second marriage began to dissolve, he made a series of solo albums which moved in a new direction. His records now featured a dark and threatening aura, often carrying a sense of barely suppressed aggression. A trilogy of albums ‚Äì Fear (1974), Slow Dazzle (1975), and Helen of Troy (1975) ‚Äì were rapidly recorded and released over the course of about a year with other Island artists, including Phil Manzanera and Brian Eno of Roxy Music and Chris Spedding, who played in his live band. A showpiece of his concerts from the era was his radically transformed cover of Elvis Presley's \\"Heartbreak Hotel,\\" initially performed by Cale on Slow Dazzle and the live album 1 June 1974, recorded with Kevin Ayers, Nico and Eno. Both \\"Leaving It Up to You\\" and \\"Fear Is a Man's Best Friend\\" (from Fear) begin as relatively conventional songs that gradually grow more paranoid in tone before breaking down into what critic Dave Thompson calls \\"a morass of discordance and screaming\\". Cale released Animal Justice in 1977, an EP notable particularly for the epic \\"Hedda Gabler\\", based very loosely on the Ibsen play. His loud, abrasive and confrontational live performances fitted well with the punk rock scene developing on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Cale took to wearing a hockey goaltender's mask onstage (as evinced by the cover of Guts (1977), a compilation drawn from the Island trilogy after the label withheld Helen of Troy in the United States); this look predated the creation of Friday the 13th's villain, Jason Voorhees, by several years. During one concert in Croydon, south London, Cale chopped the head off a dead chicken with a meat cleaver, leading his band to walk offstage in protest. Cale's drummer ‚Äì a vegetarian ‚Äì was so bothered he quit the band. Cale mocks his decision on \\"Chicken Shit\\" from the Animal Justice EP. Cale has admitted that some of his paranoia and erratic behaviour at this time was associated with heavy cocaine use.Mitchell, Tim Sedition and Alchemy : A Biography of John Cale, 2003, In 1979, he began a relationship with Austin, Texas-based groupie/journalist Margaret Moser. Cale named the group of women that Moser hung out with the Texas Blondes. His relationship with Moser lasted about five years, overlapping with the beginning of his third marriage. In December 1979, Cale's embrace of the punk rock ethic that he helped to inspire culminated in the release of Sabotage/Live. This record, recorded live at CBGB that June, features aggressive vocal and instrumental performances. The album consists entirely of new songs, many of which grapple confrontationally with global politics and paranoia. The band included Deerfrance on vocals and percussion. An earlier live set, consisting mostly of new material, was recorded at CBGB the previous year. It was released in 1987 as Even Cowgirls Get the Blues. The band on that recording includes Ivan Kral (best known for his work with Patti Smith) on bass and longtime Brian Eno associate Judy Nylon on vocals. =1980s= Cale performing live in Toronto, Canada, 1980 In 1980, Cale signed with A&M; Records and moved in a more commercial direction with the album Honi Soit. He worked with producer Mike Thorne towards this end.Thorne, Michael. The making of John Cale's Honi Soit album , stereosociety.com; accessed 3 January 2018. Andy Warhol provided the cover art, in black and white, but against Warhol's wishes, Cale colourised it. The new direction did not succeed commercially, however, and his relationship with A&M; ended. He signed with ZE Records, a company he had influenced the creation of and which had absorbed SPY Records, the label he had co-founded with Jane Friedman. The next year Cale released the sparse Music for a New Society. Seeming to blend the refined music of his early solo work with the threatening music that came later, it is by any standard a bleak, harrowing record. It's been called \\"understated, and perhaps a masterpiece.\\" He followed up with the album Caribbean Sunset, also on ZE Records. This work, with much more accessible production than Music for a New Society, was still extremely militant in some ways. It has never seen release on CD. A live album, John Cale Comes Alive, followed it and included two new studio songs, \\"Ooh La La\\" and \\"Never Give Up on You\\". Different mixes of the two studio tracks appeared on both sides of the Atlantic. During this period, Eden Cale was born to Cale and his third wife Ris√© Irushalmi in July 1985. In a last effort at commercial success, Cale recorded Artificial Intelligence, his only album for Beggars Banquet Records. Written in collaboration with High Times/National Lampoon editor Larry \\"Ratso\\" Sloman, the album was a pop effort characterised by synthesizers and drum machines. It was not significantly more successful than its predecessors, despite the relative success of the single \\"Satellite Walk\\". However, \\"Dying on the Vine\\" is generally regarded as one of Cale's best songs. Cale again returned to producing, this time for Happy Mondays on their first studio album: Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out) in 1987. In part because of his young daughter, Cale took a long break from recording and performing. He made a comeback in 1989 with the Brian Eno-produced album Words for the Dying. The album consists mainly of oral work, read or sung by Cale. It was written in 1982 as a response to the Anglo-Argentinian Falklands War, using poems written by fellow Welshman Dylan Thomas. There are also two orchestral interludes, two other solo piano pieces \\"Songs Without Words\\", and finally a song by Cale, \\"The Soul of Carmen Miranda\\". =1990s= Following Warhol's death in 1987, Cale again collaborated with Lou Reed on the album Songs for Drella (1990), a song cycle about Warhol, their mentor. The album marked an end to a 22-year estrangement from Reed. In his autobiography, Cale revealed that he resented letting Reed take charge of the Songs for Drella project. The longstanding friction between Reed and Cale contributed to the passion and lurching frustration evident in the sound of the album, as did the ambivalent relationship Reed had to Warhol. In 1990, following a 20-year hiatus, the Velvet Underground reformed for a Fondation Cartier benefit show in France. He again collaborated with Eno in the same year on Wrong Way Up, a joint album characterised by an uptempo accessibility at odds with Cale's description of the fraught relationship between the pair. A year later, Cale contributed one song, \\"Hallelujah\\", to the tribute album to Leonard Cohen, I'm Your Fan. Cale's mid-tempo acoustic version was performed on piano, and his arrangement formed the basis of most subsequent covers of the song, which has since become a standard.Leonard Cohen Asks for Brief Halt to New Covers of \\"Hallelujah\\" Rolling Stone. Retrieved 25 November 2011 In 1992, Cale performed vocals on two songs, \\"Hunger\\" and \\"First Evening\\", on French composer and producer Hector Zazou's album Sahara Blue. All lyrics on the album were based on the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. In 1994, Cale performed a spoken-word duet with Suzanne Vega on the song \\"The Long Voyage\\" on Zazou's album Chansons des mers froides. The lyrics were based on the poem \\"Les Silhouettes\\" by Oscar Wilde, and Cale co-wrote the music with Zazou. It was later released as a single (retitled \\"The Long Voyages\\" as it featured several remixes by Zazou, Mad Professor and more). In 1996, Cale released Walking on Locusts which turned out to be his only solo album of the decade. The record featured appearances by Talking Heads' David Byrne, the Soldier String Quartet, and original Velvet Underground drummer Moe Tucker. Cale composed an instrumental score for a Ballet titled Nico, performed by the Scapino Ballet in Rotterdam in October 1997 and was released as Dance Music. Cale has written a number of film soundtracks, often using more classically influenced instrumentation. In 1998, Cale mainly spent the year on tour with singer Siouxsie Sioux. In February, he was the curator of one day festival called \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" that took place at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands, with the presence of the Metropole Orchestra.Mojo, September 1998, Martin Aston, p.22 The concert was shown on Dutch national television and featured a song specially composed for the event and still unreleased, \\"Murdering Mouth\\", sung in duet with Siouxsie and her second band the Creatures. Cale and Siouxsie then did a double bill tour in the US for two months from late June until mid-August, both artists collaborating on stage on several songs including a version of \\"Venus in Furs\\". Cale's autobiography, What's Welsh for Zen?, was written in collaboration with Victor Bockris and published in 1999 by Bloomsbury Publishing. =2000s‚Äìpresent= UCLA's Royce Hall in Los Angeles, California, 2010 Cale recorded a cover of \\"Hallelujah\\" by Leonard Cohen for the 1991 album \\"I'm Your Fan.\\" Cohen's original version of the song had not garnered much interest; it was only through Cale's arrangement and recording of it (and Jeff Buckley's subsequent cover of Cale's arrangement) that it achieved popularity. It was used in the 2001 animated film Shrek, although it did not appear in the film's soundtrack due to licensing issues. Signing to EMI in 2003 with the EP 5 Tracks and the album HoboSapiens, Cale again returned as a regular recording artist, this time with music influenced by modern electronica and alternative rock. The well-received album was co-produced with Nick Franglen of Lemon Jelly. It was followed by his 2005 album blackAcetate. In 2005, Cale produced Austin singer-songwriter Alejandro Escovedo's eighth album, The Boxing Mirror, which was released in May 2006. In June 2006, Cale released a radio and digital single, \\"Jumbo in tha Modernworld\\", which was a standalone single. A video was created for the song as well. In March 2007 a 23-song live retrospective, Circus Live, was released in Europe. This two-disc album, composed of recordings from both the 2004 and 2006 tours, featured new arrangements and reworkings of songs from his entire career. Of particular interest is the Amsterdam Suite, a set of songs from a performance at the Amsterdam Paradiso in 2004.Archived by the venue on their Internet performance repository A studio-created drone has been edited into these songs. The set also included a DVD, featuring electric rehearsal material and a short acoustic set, as well as the video for \\"Jumbo in tha Modernworld\\", a 2006 single. In May 2007 Cale contributed a cover of the LCD Soundsystem song \\"All My Friends\\" to the vinyl and digital single releases of the LCD Soundsystem original. Cale has continued to work with other artists, contributing viola to Replica Sun Machine, the Danger Mouse-produced second album by London psychedelic trio the Shortwave Set and producing the second album of American indie band Ambulance LTD. On 11 October 2008 Cale hosted an event to pay tribute to Nico called \\"Life Along the Borderline\\" in celebration of what, five days later, would have been her 70th birthday. The event was reprised at the Teatro Communale in Ferrara, Italy on 10 May 2009. Cale represented Wales at the 2009 Venice Biennale, collaborating with artists, filmmakers, and poets, and focusing the artwork on his relationship with the Welsh language. In January 2010 Cale was invited to be the first Eminent Art in Residence (EAR) at the MONA FOMA festival curated by Brian Ritchie held in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. His work for the 2009 Venice Biennale 'Dyddiau Du (dark days)' was shown at the festival, along with a number of live performances at venues around Hobart. Cale performing live at Urban SimpleLife Festical in 2010 The Paris 1919 album was performed, in its entirety, at the Coal Exchange in Cardiff on 21 November 2009, at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 5 March 2010, and the Theatre Royal in Norwich on 14 May 2010. These performances were reprised in Paris, France, on 5 September 2010; Brescia, Italy, on 11 September 2010; Los Angeles, California, on 30 September 2010 at UCLA's Royce Hall; Melbourne, Australia, on 16 October 2010; Barcelona, Spain, on 28 May 2010 and Essen, Germany, on 6 October 2011. In February 2011, Cale signed a record deal with Domino Records subsidiary Double Six and released an EP, Extra Playful, in September 2011. In May 2011, he and his band appeared at the Brighton Festival, performing songs to the theme of √âmigr√©/Lost & Found. Cale appeared at the invitation of the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, who was the festival's guest director. In the autumn of 2012 Cale released Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood, his first full-length studio album since 2005. The album features a collaboration with Danger Mouse, \\"I Wanna Talk 2 U\\". Critical reception of the album was mixed to positive, with The Guardian newspaper describing it as \\"an album that combines the 70-year-old's experience with the glee of a small child.\\" In 2014 he appeared as vendor in an episode \\"Sorrowsworn\\" of the crime drama television series The Bridge. Cale released his sixteenth solo album M:FANS in January 2016. It features new versions of songs from his 1982 album Music for a New Society. In July 2016 Cale performed the songs \\"Valentine's Day\\", \\"Sorrow\\" and \\"Space Oddity\\" at a late-night BBC Prom concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London, celebrating the music of David Bowie. At the 2017 Grammy Salute to Music Legends ceremony, Cale performed with, amongst others, Moe Tucker, two Velvet Underground classics, \\"Sunday Morning\\" and \\"I'm Waiting for the Man\\". The Velvet Underground were also the recipients of the 2017 Merit Award. In February 2019 Cale collaborated with Marissa Nadler on her new single \\"Poison\\". In September 2019, he gives three concerts titled 1964-2019 Futurespective at the Paris' Philharmonie, inviting his compatriot Cate Le Bon to join the band. Cale features on the track \\"Corner of My Sky\\" from Kelly Lee Owens' album Inner Song due out on 28 August 2020. On October 6, 2020 Cale released a new track and accompanying video called \\"Lazy Day\\".https://pitchfork.com/news/john-cale- shares-video-for-new-song-lazy-day-watch/ Honours/Legacy Cale was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996. At the ceremony, Cale, Reed, and Tucker performed a song titled \\"Last Night I Said Goodbye to My Friend\\", dedicated to Sterling Morrison, who had died the previous August Cale was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. Personal life Cale married fashion designer Betsey Johnson in 1968. The couple divorced in 1971 having been married three years. In 1971, Cale met Cynthia \\"Cindy\\" Wells, better known as Miss Cindy of the GTOs,Mitchell, Tim Sedition and Alchemy : A Biography of John Cale, 2003, p. 82 and they married soon afterward.

Biographer Tim Mitchell claims Cale's early dependence on medicine was a \\"formative experience\\". Cale later told an interviewer that, \\"When I got to New York, drugs were everywhere, and they quickly became part of my artistic experiment\\". He was heavily involved in New York City's drug scene of the 1960s and 1970s, with cocaine as his drug of choice. He is said to have \\"taken most of the available drugs in the United States.\\" Cale has said that, \\"In the '60s, for me, drugs were a cool experiment... In the '70s, I got in over my head.\\" Cale feels his drug addiction negatively affected his music during the 1980s. He decided to clean up following a series of embarrassing concerts and the birth of his daughter. According to a 2009 BBC interview, the \\"strongest drug\\" he was then taking was coffee. Cale has also hosted a documentary called Heroin, Wales and Me to promote awareness of the problems of heroin addiction, easy availability and low cost of the drug in his native Wales and thousands of addicts.

Sarah Winnemucca was born near Humboldt Lake, Nevada, into an influential Paiute family who led their community in pursuing friendly relations with the arriving groups of Anglo- American settlers. She was sent to study in a Catholic school in Santa Clara, California. When the Paiute War erupted between the Pyramid Lake Paiute and the settlers, including some who were friends of the Winnemucca family, Sarah and some of her family traveled to San Francisco and Virginia City to escape the fighting. They made a living performing onstage as \\"A Paiute Royal Family.\\" In 1865, while the Winnemucca family was away, their band was attacked by the US cavalry, who killed 29 Paiutes, including Sarah's mother and several members of her extended family. Subsequently, Winnemucca became an advocate for the rights of Native Americans, traveling across the US to tell Anglo-Americans about the plight of her people. When the Paiute were interned in a concentration camp at Yakima, Washington after the Bannock War, she traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress and the executive branch for their release. She also served US forces as a messenger, interpreter, and guide, and as a teacher for imprisoned Native Americans. Winnemucca published Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims (1884), a book that is both a memoir and history of her people during their first 40 years of contact with European Americans. It is considered the \\"first known autobiography written by a Native American woman.\\"Voices from the Gaps: \\"Sarah Winnemucca Hopkins\\", University of Minnesota website, accessed 11 February 204 Anthropologist Omer Stewart described it as \\"one of the first and one of the most enduring ethnohistorical books written by an American Indian,\\" frequently cited by scholars.Omer Stewart, Review: \\"Gae Whitney Canfield, 'Sarah Winnemucca of the Northern Paiutes', Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma, 1983\\", Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology, 5(2), 1983, accessed 12 February 2014 Following the publication of the book, Winnemucca toured the Eastern United States, giving lectures about her people in New England, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. She returned to the West, founding a private school for Native American children in Lovelock, Nevada. Since the late 20th century, scholars have paid renewed attention to Winnemucca for her accomplishments. In 1993, she was inducted posthumously into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame. In 2005, the state of Nevada contributed a statue of her by sculptor Benjamin Victor to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol. Winnemucca's legacy has been controversial. Some biographers have wished to remember her primarily for her activism and social work to better the conditions for her people, while others have criticized her for her tendency to exaggerate her social status among the Paiute. Among the Paiute, her assistance to the US military at a time when they were at war with the Paiute has been criticized, as has her advocacy for assimilation of Natives to Anglo- American culture. But the Paiute have also recognized her social work and activism for indigenous rights.Fowler, Catherine. 1994. \\"Foreword\\" in Sarah Winnemucca, Life Among the Paiutes: Their Wrongs and Claims, University of Nebraska Press, p. 3 Early life and education Born \\"somewhere near 1844\\" at Humboldt Lake in what is now western Nevada, Sarah Winnemucca was the daughter of Winnemucca (Poito), a Shoshone who had joined the Paiute through marriage, and his wife Tuboitonie.

At the age of six, Sarah traveled with her family to near Stockton, California, where the adults worked in the cattle industry. In 1857, their grandfather arranged for Sarah (then 13) and her sister Elma to live and work in the household of William Ormsby and his wife; he had a hotel and was a civic leader of Carson City, Nevada. The couple wanted a companion for their daughter, Lizzie. The Winnemucca girls also did domestic work in the house. They had a chance to improve their English and learn more about European-American ways.Canfield (1983), Sarah Winnemucca, p. 11 Sarah particularly began to be at ease in going back and forth between Paiute and European-American culture. She was one of the few Paiute in Nevada who knew how to read and write English, and her family all spoke English. Pyramid Lake War and stage Numaga, or \\"Young Winnemucca\\", Sarah Winnemucca's cousin and war leader of the Paiute in the Pyramid Lake War. With the decreasing pressure of new migrants in the region attracted to the Washoe silver finds, Old Winnemucca arranged in 1859 to have his daughters returned to him again in Nevada. In 1860, open conflict occurred. The Paiute had killed two men who had kidnapped and abused two Paiute girls. Settlers and miners organized a militia, making Major Ormsby lead it by default. He was killed by the Paiute in a disciplined confrontation in the first event of the Pyramid Lake War. Settlers were alarmed at how well the Paiute fought and the ill-prepared miners could not hold their own.Canfield (1983), Sarah Winnemucca, pp. 24‚Äì25 The Paiute and whites reached a truce by the end of the summer. Young Winnemucca, Sarah's cousin, led the Paiute as a war chief by then. In October 1860, their grandfather Truckee died of a tarantula bite. As a mark of development, Nevada was established as a distinct US Territory, and James W. Nye was appointed as its first governor. When he came to the territory, he went to the Pyramid Lake Reservation, where he met Old Winnemucca, Young Winnemucca and the Paiute, who put on a grand display.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, p. 33 For the next five years (1860‚Äì1865), Sarah and her family frequently traveled away from the reservation, performing on stage, either in Virginia City, Nevada at Maguire's Opera House, or in San Francisco. They were billed as the \\"Paiute Royal Family.\\" By this time, her father had taken a second, younger wife, with whom he had a young son. In Nevada, US forces repeatedly acted against Native Americans to \\"remind them of who was in charge.\\" The Natives were repeatedly accused of raids and cattle stealing. In 1865 Captain Almond B. Wells led a Nevada Volunteer cavalry in indiscriminate raids across the northern part of the state, attacking Paiute bands. While Sarah and her father were in Dayton, Nevada, Wells and his men attacked Old Winnemucca's camp, killing 29 of the 30 persons in the band, who were old men, women and children. The chief's two wives (including Sarah's mother) and infant son were killed. Although Sarah's sister Mary escaped from camp, she died later that winter due to the severe conditions.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, pp. 44‚Äì45 Her younger sister Elma was out of the area, as she had been adopted by a French family in Marysville, California. There Elma Winnemucca married John Smith, a white man, and moved with him to a white community in Montana and, later, Idaho. In 1868 about 490 Paiute survivors moved to a military camp, which became known as Fort McDermitt, on the Nevada‚ÄìOregon border. They sought protection from the US Army against the Nevada Volunteers. In 1872 the federal government established the Malheur Reservation in eastern Oregon, designated by President Ulysses S. Grant for the Northern Paiute and Bannock peoples in the area. Three bands of Paiute moved there at the time. In 1875, Sarah, her brother Natchez and his family, and their father Old Winnemucca moved there, too.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, p. 92 Teaching and interpreter Winnemucca was invited to work as the interpreter at the Malheur Reservation by Indian Agent Samuel B. Parrish. She found in observing Parrish that he worked well with the Paiute; he encouraged them in learning some new ways and helped them plant crops that could support the people, establishing a well- managed agricultural program. He had a school built at the reservation, and Sarah became an assistant teacher.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, pp. 94‚Äì99 Marriage and family Sarah married Edward Bartlett, a former First Lieutenant in the Army, on 29 January 1872 at Salt Lake City, Utah. He abandoned her, and she returned to Camp McDermitt. In 1876, after having moved to Malheur Reservation, she got a divorce and filed to take back her name of Winnemucca, which the court granted.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, pp. 109‚Äì110 Bannock War After four years, Parrish was replaced in the summer of 1876 by agent William V. Rinehart. The Paiute were sorry to see Parrish leave. A proponent of extermination-style warfare, Rinehart emphasized keeping the Paiute under his thumb. He reversed many of the policies that Parrish had initiated, telling the Paiute the reservation land belonged to the government. He failed to pay their workers for agricultural labor in communal fields, and alienated many tribal leaders. Conditions at the Malheur Reservation quickly became intolerable. In her 1883 book, Winnemucca recounted that Rinehart sold supplies intended for the Paiute people to local whites. Much of the good land on the reservation was illegally expropriated by white settlers. In 1878, virtually all of the Paiute and Bannock people left the reservation because of these abuses and their difficulties in living. The Bannock from southern Idaho had left the Fort Hall Reservation due to similar problems. They moved west, raiding isolated white settlements in southern Oregon and northern Nevada, triggering the Bannock War (1878). The degree to which Northern Paiute people participated with the Bannock is unclear. Winnemucca wrote that she and several other Paiute families were held hostage by the Bannock during the war. During the Bannock War, Winnemucca worked as a translator for General Oliver O. Howard of the U.S. Army, whom she had met during his visit to the reservation; she also acted as a scout and messenger. According to her account, the Bannock warriors and the Army soldiers liked each other so much that they rarely shot to kill. For whatever reason, casualties were relatively few. Winnemucca was highly regarded by the officers she worked for, and she included letters of recommendation from several of them in her 1883 book. Impressed by many of the officers, Winnemucca began to support the US Army's position to have the military take over administration of the Indian reservations, rather than political appointees. (Note: After the 1870 Marias Massacre by US Army forces in Montana, President Grant had promoted a peace policy, appointing Quaker leaders as Indian agents to reservations and intending to eradicate problems of corruption that way.) Move to Yakama Reservation Sarah Winnemucca, performing as \\"Princess Winnemucca\\", daughter of Chief Winnemucca Following the Bannock War, the Northern Paiute bands were ordered from Nevada to the Yakama Indian Reservation (in eastern Washington Territory), where they endured great deprivation. A total of 543 Paiute were interned in what has been described as a \\"concentration camp.\\" Winnemucca accompanied them to serve as a translator. Since she had an official job, she was not required to live on a reservation. Outraged by the harsh conditions forced on the Paiute, she began to lecture across California and Nevada on the plight of her people. During the winter of 1879 and 1880, she, her father, and two other Winnemucca visited Washington, DC to lobby for release of the Paiute from the Yakama Reservation. They gained permission from Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz, for the Paiute to be allowed to return to Malheur, at their own expense. Instead, the government decided to \\"discontinue\\" the Malheur Reservation in 1879, closing it. \\"Knowing the temper of the people through whom they must pass, still smarting from the barbarities of the war two years previous, and that the Paiutes, utterly destitute of everything, must subsist themselves on their route by pillage, I refused permission for them to depart . . . and soon after, on being more correctly informed of the state of affairs, the Hon. Secretary revoked his permission though no determination as to their permanent location was arrived at. This was a great disappointment to the Paiutes and the greatest caution and care was necessary in dealing with them.\\" : Report of Yakama Agent, James H. Wilbur : Annual Report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the Year 1881, pp. 174, 175.\\"Today in History: October 14.\\" The Library of Congress. (retrieved 11 April 2010) Second marriage In 1881 General Oliver O. Howard hired Sarah Winnemucca to teach Shoshone prisoners held at Vancouver Barracks. While there, she met and became close to Lieutenant Lewis H. Hopkins, an Indian Department employee. They married that year in San Francisco. Lectures and writing thumb In 1883, the Hopkinses traveled east, where Sarah delivered nearly 300 lectures throughout major cities of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, seeking to heighten awareness of injustice against Native Americans. The press reported her talks and often referred to her as the \\"Paiute Princess.\\" In Boston, she met the sisters Elizabeth Peabody and Mary Peabody Mann, married to the educator Horace Mann; they began to promote her speaking career. In addition, the two women helped her to compile and prepare her lecture materials for publication as Life Among the Piutes. Her book was published in 1883, the \\"first known autobiography written by a Native American woman\\" and the first U.S. copyright registration secured by a Native American woman. Sarah's husband had contributed to his wife's efforts by gathering material for the book at the Library of Congress. But he was suffering from tuberculosis, and Winnemucca learned that he was addicted to gambling; her earnings were eaten up by his needs. After returning to Nevada in 1884, Winnemucca spent a year lecturing in San Francisco. When she returned again to Pyramid Lake, she and her brother built a school for Indian children at Lovelock, Nevada, in order to promote the Paiute culture and language. The Peabody Indian School, named for their benefactor Mary Peabody Mann in Boston, operated for a couple of years.Canfield (1988), Sarah Winnemucca, p. 232 Changes in federal policy following what was considered the success of the Carlisle Indian School prompted the federal government to promote education for Native American children at English-language boarding schools. Winnemucca's school was closed in 1887 and the children transferred to a facility in Grand Junction, Colorado. Despite a bequest from Mary Peabody Mann and efforts to turn the school into a technical training center, Winnemucca was struggling financially by the time of her husband's death in 1887. The Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 required allotment of communal lands on reservations to individual households to force assimilation of tribes. Winnemucca spent the last four years of her life retired from public activity. She died of tuberculosis at her sister, Elma Smith's home at Henry's Lake, Idaho. Legacy *Anthropologist Omer C.

He is considered the \\"father of American minstrelsy\\". His act drew on aspects of African American culture and popularized them with a national, and later international, audience. Rice's \\"Jim Crow\\" persona was an ethnic depiction in accordance with contemporary Caucasian ideas of Africans and their culture. The character was based on a folk trickster named Jim Crow that was long popular among black slaves. Rice also adapted and popularized a traditional slave song called \\"Jump Jim Crow\\". Biography Thomas Dartmouth Rice was born on the lower east side of Manhattan, New York. His family resided in the commercial district near the East River docks. Rice received some formal education in his youth, but ceased in his teenage years when he acquired an apprenticeship with a woodcarver named Dodge. Despite this occupational training, Rice quickly made a career as a performer. By 1827, Rice was a traveling actor, appearing not only as a stock player in several New York theaters, but also performing on frontier stages in the coastal South and the Ohio River valley. According to a former stage colleague, Rice was \\"tall and wiry, and a great deal on the build of Bob Fitzsimmons, the prizefighter\\". According to another account he was at least six feet tall.The New York Times, August 22, 1887: 'Things At Hand' He frequently told stories of George Washington, who he claimed had been a friend of his father.The New York Times, May 19, 1907: - 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels; Interesting Reminiscenses(sic) of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago'. Career Thomas D. Rice as Jim Crow as drawn by Edward Williams Clay Rice had made the Jim Crow character his signature act by 1832.American Sentinel (Philadelphia), September 11, 1832: \\"Mr. Rice will appear and sing Jim Crow.\\" Rice went from one theater to another, singing his Jim Crow Song. He became known as \\"Jim Crow Rice\\". There had been other blackface performers before Rice, and there were many more afterwards. But it was \\"Daddy Rice\\" who became so indelibly associated with a single character. Rice claimed to have been inspired by a crippled black stable groom, who sang and danced as he did his work, and even claimed to have bought the man's clothes for \\"authenticity.\\" The time, place and truth of this claim have been disputed. He soon expanded his repertoire, with his most popular routine being his \\"shadow dance.\\" Rice would appear on stage carrying a sack slung over his shoulder, then sing the song \\"Me and My Shadow\\" (not the better-known 1920s song). As Rice began to dance, a child actor in blackface would crawl out of the sack, and emulate each of Rice's moves and steps. Rice also performed as the \\"Yankee\\" character, an already-established stage stereotype who represented rural America and dressed in a long blue coat and striped pants. Rice's greatest prominence came in the 1830s, before the rise of full-blown blackface minstrel shows, when blackface performances were typically part of a variety show or as an entr'acte in another play.The Times, Friday, January 18, 1833; pg. 5: 'PARTAKING OF A THEATRICAL ENTERTAINMENT': Describes a performance of Shakespeare's Richard III at the Bowery followed by Rice performing his 'Jim Crow' act. During the years of his peak popularity, from roughly 1832 to 1844, Rice often encountered sold-out houses, with audiences demanding numerous encores. In 1836 he popularized blackface entertainment with English audiences when he appeared in London,\\"SURREY THEATRE: This theatre, which last year was so prolific in sea pieces, has this season been abundant in a novel species of entertainment. A sort of extravaganzas, called \\"black operas\\", has superseded the ancient drama, and the Black-Eyed Susan of former days has been obliged to give place to the black-faced Susan of the Transatlantic importations from Boston and New York. Mr. Rice, whose Jim Crow has insured his reputation in every street of the metropolis, and whose admirable representation of the negroes of the United States has raised a host of imitators, is the hero of these black burlettas. Mr Rice is in his way the most accomplished artist on the boards, his personation is the beau ideal of a negro. There is something in his chuckle which is not to be described, but which is equally rich, veracious, and inimitable. He has the faculty of twisting his limbs in such a manner as to represent the distortions of an ill grown African, and the very tibia of his legs appear to shape themselves in aid of his endeavours. The novelty of last night is called, Oh, Hush! or Life in New York. This is merely a vehicle for the exhibition of the very peculiar talent of the performer, and as such it fully answers its purpose. The plot consists in the loves of the black hero and heroine (Mr. W. Smith) who are made to dance, sing and caper through three or four scenes... There is not much point in the songs or the dialogue, but there are several good hits, and of them Mr. Rice made the most.\\" The Times, Wednesday, October 26, 1836; pg. 5; Issue 16244; col G. Rice was so successful he soon transferred to the more upmarket Adelphi Theatre in a play built especially around his Jim Crow character; this was also a hit. The Times, November 8, 1836, p. 5 although he and his character were known there by reputation at least by 1833. Rice not only performed in more than 100 plays, but also created plays of his own, providing himself slight variants on the Jim Crow persona‚Äîas Cuff in Oh, Hush! (1833), Ginger Blue in Virginia Mummy (1835), and Bone Squash in Bone Squash Diavolo (1835). Shortly after making his first hit in London in Oh, Hush, Rice starred in a more prestigious production, a three-act play at the Adelphi Theatre in London.A Flight to America, or Ten Hours in New York (1836), was the vehicle written for Rice by William Leman Rede. In it the Jim Crow character is developed to share similarities with the 'witty servant' of stage tradition. An Englishman fleeing creditors arrives in New York, where on the quayside he meets Jim Crow and hires him as his valet. The plot involves a beautiful young heiress being forced into a loveless marriage by her rascally uncle, and an episode where the astonished Englishman returns to his lodgings (drunk) to find Jim Crow has invited all his friends there to celebrate \\"the emancipation of the negroes\\" ‚Äì presumably a reference to the ending of slavery in the British Caribbean colonies. Eventually, thanks to Jim Crow, the machinations of the uncle and his wicked associate (a \\"regular calculating Yankee... from Virginia\\" [sic]) are defeated. The thwarted villain then claims Jim Crow is an escaped slave but the Englishman buys his freedom and the play ends with the heiress marrying her own true love and Jim Crow marrying his. The Times, November 8, 1836; pg. 5 Moreover, Rice wrote and starred in Otello (1844); he also played the title character in Uncle Tom's Cabin. Starting in 1854 he played in one of the more prominent (and one of the least abolitionist) \\"Tom shows\\", loosely based on Harriet Beecher Stowe's book.Lott, Eric. Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. . p. 211. \\"The Virginny Cupids\\" was an operatic olio and the most popular of the time. It is centered on a song \\"Coal Black Rose\\", which predated the playlet. Rice played Cuff, boss of the bootblacks, and he wins the girl, Rose, away from the black dandy Sambo Johnson, a former bootblack who made money by winning a lottery.Lott, Eric. Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. . p. 133. According to Broadbent,Annals of Annals of the Liverpool Stage, from the Earliest Period to the Present Time (New York), 1969: \\"T. D. Rice, the celebrated negro comedian, performed \\"Jump Jim Crow\\" with witty local allusions\\" at Ducrow's Royal Amphitheatre (now The Royal Court Theatre), Liverpool, England. At least initially, blackface could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society. As early as 1832, Rice was singing, \\"An' I caution all white dandies not to come in my way, / For if dey insult me, dey'll in de gutter lay.\\" It also on occasion equated lower-class white and lower-class black audiences; while parodying Shakespeare, Rice sang, \\"Aldough I'm a black man, de white is call'd my broder.\\"Ashny, LeRoy, With Amusement for All, University Press of Kentucky, 2006, pg. 17-18 Personal life and death On one of his stage tours in England, Rice married Charlotte Bridgett Gladstone in 1837. She died in 1847, and none of their children survived infancy. Rice enjoyed displaying his wealth, and on his return from London wore a blue dress coat with gold guineas for buttons, and a vest on which each gold button bore a solitaire diamond. As early as 1840 Rice suffered from a type of paralysis which began to limit his speech and movements, and eventually led to his death on September 19, 1860. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York in what is now an unmarked grave. A reminiscence of him in The New York Times suggests his death was alcohol-related, and states that although he had made a considerable fortune in his time, his later years were spent in a liquor saloon and his burial was paid for by public subscription. In popular culture In the later half of the 19th century a wooden statue of Rice in his \\"Jim Crow\\" character stood in various New York locations, including outside the Chatham Garden Theatre.The New York Times, June 22, 1902 It was painted and made in four pieces, with both arms and the right leg below the knee being separate parts screwed to the trunk. Prior to at least 1871 it had stood on Broadway outside \\"a well-known resort of actors and showmen\\".The New York Times, April 2, 1871: 'Sidewalk Statues' According to an article in The New York Times it had apparently been carved by Rice himself in 1833, although a different account in the same paper says it had been carved by a celebrated figurehead carver called Weeden, and yet another article attributes it to Rice's former employer \\"Charley\\" Dodge.The New York Times, May 30, 1882: \\"Carving Wooden Figures\\". It had long been used by Rice as an advertising feature and accompanied him on his successful tour of London.

The song is speculated to have been taken from Jim Crow (sometimes called Jim Cuff), a physically disabled African slave, who is variously claimed to have resided in St. Louis, Cincinnati, or Pittsburgh., see pages 137-138 The song became a great 19th-century hit and Rice performed all over the country as \\"Daddy Pops Jim Crow\\". \\"Jump Jim Crow\\" was a key initial step in a tradition of popular music in the United States that was based on the racist \\"imitation\\" and mockery of black people. The first song sheet edition appeared in the early 1830s, published by E. Riley. A couple of decades would see the mockery genre explode in popularity with the rise of the minstrel show. The song originally printed used \\"floating verses\\", which appear in altered forms in other popular folk songs. The chorus of the song is closely related to the traditional Uncle Joe / Hop High Ladies; some folklorists consider \\"Jim Crow\\" and \\"Uncle Joe\\" to be a single, continuous family of songs.Alternative lyrics at Blugrassmessenger.com As a result of Rice's fame, the term Jim Crow had become a pejorative term for African Americans by 1838Woodward, C.

Jim may be derived from \\"Jimmy\\", an old cant term for a crow, which is based on a pun for the tool \\"crow\\" (crowbar). Before 1900, crowbars were called \\"crows\\" and a short crowbar was and still is called a \\"jimmy\\" (\\"jemmy\\" in British English), a typical burglar's tool.Lockwood's dictionary of terms used in the practice of mechanical engineering by Joseph Gregory Horner (1892).For example, in the New York statutes on burglary it reads: \\"... having in his possession any pick-lock, key, crow, jack, bit, jimmy, nippers, pick, betty or other implement of burglary ...\\"John Ruskin in Flors Clavigera writes: \\"... this poor thief, with his crow-bar and jimmy\\" (1871). The folk concept of a dancing crow predates the Jump Jim Crow minstrelsy and has its origins in the old farmer's practice of soaking corn in whiskey and leaving it out for the crows. The crows eat the corn and become so drunk that they cannot fly, but wheel and jump helplessly near the ground, where the farmer can kill them with a club.\\"Sometimes he made the crows drunk on corn soaked in whiskey, and as they reeled among the hillocks, knocked them on the head\\", \\"A Legend of Crow Hill\\".

Maria Callcott In 1852, the bookstore and library located at 13‚Äì15 West Street in Boston closed down. Members of the Transcendentalist movement had begun to disperse since the mid-1840s and income from the bookstore had gradually declined. In 2011, the Boston Landmarks Commission designated the building as a Boston Landmark. =The Dial= Elizabeth Peabody For a time, Peabody was the business manager of The Dial, the main publication of the Transcendentalists. In 1843, she noted that the journal's income was not covering the cost of printing and that subscriptions totaled just over two hundred. In 1844 the magazine published Peabody's translation of a portion of the Lotus Sutra from French, which was the first English version of a Buddhist scripture. The publication ceased shortly thereafter in April 1844.Gura, Philip F. American Transcendentalism: A History. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 130. =Kindergarten= When Peabody opened her kindergarten in 1860, the practice of providing formal schooling for children younger than six was largely confined to Germany. She had a particular interest in the educational methods of Friedrich Fr√∂bel, particularly after meeting one of his students living in the U.S. 1859 named Margarethe Schurz. In 1867, she visited Germany for the purpose of studying Fr√∂bel's teachings more closely. Through her own kindergarten, and as editor of the Kindergarten Messenger (1873‚Äì1877), Peabody helped establish kindergarten as an accepted institution in American education. She also wrote numerous books in support of the cause. The extent of her influence is apparent in a statement submitted to Congress on February 12, 1897, in support of free kindergartens: ::The advantage to the community in utilizing the age from 4 to 6 in training the hand and eye; in developing the habits of cleanliness, politeness, self-control, urbanity, industry; in training the mind to understand numbers and geometric forms, to invent combinations of figures and shapes, and to represent them with the pencil‚Äîthese and other valuable lessons‚Ä¶ will, I think, ultimately prevail in securing to us the establishment of this beneficent institution in all the city school systems of our country. =Diverse activities= With grounding in history and literature and a reading knowledge of ten languages, in 1840 she also opened a bookstore which held Margaret Fuller's \\"Conversations\\" and published books from Nathaniel Hawthorne and others in addition to the periodicals The Dial and √Üsthetic Papers. She was an advocate of antislavery and of Transcendentalism. Moreover, she also led decades of efforts for the rights of the Paiute Indians. Personal life Grave of Elizabeth Palmer Peabody Her sisters were painter Sophia Peabody Hawthorne (wife of writer Nathaniel Hawthorne) and writer Mary Tyler Peabody Mann (wife of educator Horace Mann). Peabody died January 3, 1894, aged 89. She is buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts.Library of Congress Today in History: May 16 Selected works Peabody published a number of works, including: * Record of a school: exemplifying the general principles of spiritual culture.

All students of the college are undergraduates and nearly all reside on campus. The college was founded in 1833 by area members of the Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) to ensure an education grounded in Quaker values for young Quaker men. Although the college no longer has a formal religious affiliation, Quaker philosophy still influences campus life. Originally an all-male institution, Haverford began admitting female transfer students in the 1970s and became fully co-educational in 1980. Currently, more than half of Haverford's students are women. For most of the 20th century, Haverford's total enrollment was kept below 300, but the school went through two periods of expansion during and after the 1970s, and its enrollment, as of 2018, was 1,353 students. The college offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 31 majors across humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Haverford College is a member of the Tri-College Consortium, which allows students to register for courses at both Bryn Mawr College and Swarthmore College. It is also a member of the Quaker Consortium which allows students to cross-register at the University of Pennsylvania. Among college faculty and alumni are 4 Nobel Prize recipients, 6 Pulitzer Prize recipients, 20 Rhodes Scholars, and 38 Fulbright Scholars.  Honor Code  In 1897, the students and faculty of Haverford voted to adopt an Honor Code to govern academic affairs. Since 1963, every student has been allowed to schedule his or her own final exams. Take-home examinations are also common at Haverford. These exams may include strict instructions such as time limits, prohibitions on using assigned texts or personal notes, and calculator usage. All students are bound to follow these instructions by the Code. 270x270px Originally conceived as a code of academic honesty, the Honor Code had expanded by the 1970s to govern social interactions. The code does not list specific rules of behavior, but rather emphasizes a philosophy of mutual trust, concern and respect, as well as genuine engagement, that students are expected to follow. A student (or other community member) who feels that another has broken the Code, is encouraged not to look the other way but rather to confront and engage in a dialogue with the potential offender, before taking matters to an Honor Council which can help mediate the dispute. A great controversy ensued in the spring of 2018 when the Honor Code failed to be approved. After repeated debate and impasses, the old Honor Code was re-instituted after the prior code was replaced by the administration's interim procedures. Student government officers administer the Code, and all academic matters are heard by student juries. More severe matters are addressed by administrators. Abstracts from cases heard by students and joint administrative-student panels are distributed to all students by several means, including as print-outs in mailboxes. The trial abstracts are made anonymous by the use of pseudonyms who are often characters from entertainment or history. Every student is required to sign a pledge agreeing to the Honor Code prior to matriculation. The Haverford Honor Code is entirely student-run. The Code originated with a body of students who felt it necessary, and current Haverford students administer and amend it every year.  Academics = Academic program = Haverford offers Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 31 majors across humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. All departments require a senior thesis, project or research for graduation, and many departments also have junior-level seminar or year-long project such as in biology (superlab) and chemistry (superlab). The college also maintains a distribution requirement, spreading course work in all three areas of humanities, social sciences and natural sciences, in addition to major course works. =Consortium= Haverford's consortium relationship with Bryn Mawr, Swarthmore, and the University of Pennsylvania (the Quaker Consortium) greatly expands its course offerings. Haverford and Bryn Mawr have a particularly close relationship (the Bi-College Consortium), with over 2,000 students cross-registering between the two schools. The campuses are only 1 mile apart and a shuttle called the Blue Bus runs frequently back and forth. Some departments, such as Religion and Music, are housed at Haverford, while others like Theatre and Growth and Structure of Cities are at Bryn Mawr. Students can major in these departments from both colleges. Furthermore, students of one of the Tri-Collegiate Consortium Schools (Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr, and Haverford) are allowed to pursue a major in a subject at a Tri-Collegiate institution apart from the one they are a student of. =Admissions= { class=\\"wikitable mw-collapsible\\" style=\\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin:10px\\" \\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; margin:auto;\\" + Fall Admission Statistics - ! !2020 !2019 !2018 !2017 !2016 !2015 Haverford College Common Data Set.

Of those admitted to the class of 2024, 46.1% identified as persons of color, and 11% of those admitted were international students. = Rankings = Haverford is tied for 15th among U.S. liberal arts colleges in the 2021 \\"Best Colleges\\" ranking by U.S News & World Report, and ranked 18th for \\"Best Value\\" and tied at 23rd for \\"Best Undergraduate Teaching\\" among liberal arts colleges. Washington Monthly ranked Haverford 12th in 2020 among 218 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. The college was ranked 49th across 650 universities and colleges in the 2019 edition of Forbes \\"Top Colleges\\", and 18th among liberal arts colleges alone. Niche ranked the school the 7th best national liberal arts college for 2021. =Graduates= National Science Foundation data show that Haverford is No. 6 among liberal arts colleges, and No. 8 among all colleges and universities in the United States, for having the highest proportion of graduates who went on to earn PhDs across all fields from 2008 to 2017. When limited to doctorates in science and engineering disciplines, Haverford ranks No. 6 among liberal arts colleges and No. 10 among all colleges and universities. Campus 260x260px Haverford College is located on the Main Line northwest of Philadelphia. The school is connected to Center City Philadelphia by the Paoli/Thorndale Line commuter rail system and Norristown High Speed Line (R100). The northwest portion of the campus is located in Haverford Township in Delaware County, and the southwest part of the campus is located in Lower Merion Township in Montgomery County. The campus itself is situated in an affluent suburban neighborhood, adjacent to the Haverford School, the Merion Golf Club and the Merion Cricket Club, one of the oldest country clubs in the United States. Nearby attractions within walking distance include various food markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and Suburban Square, which hosts retail stores, restaurants and a local farmer's market. =Buildings= 260x260px The college operates more than 50 academic, athletic, and residential buildings, which are mostly stone and reflect Quaker and colonial design principles. The most recent additions are the Marian E. Koshland Integrated Natural Science Center and the Douglas B. Gardner '83 Integrated Athletic Center (colloquially referred to as the GIAC). Two dorms, by Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, began housing freshman and upperclassman in the fall of 2012. Haverford's Magill Library boasts more than a half million of its own volumes and has access to nearly two million more through its unusual Tripod computerized catalog system, which integrates its library with those of neighboring Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore Colleges. In addition to Magill's main resources, the college houses a number of special collections including the Quaker and Special Collections, the C.C. Morris 1904 Cricket Library, and numerous rare books and other treasures; the college also maintains three smaller music, science, and astronomy libraries on campus. In the fall of 2017, the College unveiled renovations to Ryan Gym, which now serves as a new Visual Culture, Arts, and Media facility (VCAM), housing the Visual Studies Minor, the Haverford Innovations Program, a Maker Arts Space, and the John B. Hurford ‚Äô60 Center for the Arts and Humanities and its Philadelphia Area Creative Collaboratives Initiative. The project, designed by MSR Architects, earned a 2018 Education Facility Design Award of Excellence from the American Institute of Architects. A second phase to the college's recently completed Lives That Speak campaign involves a renovation of Magill Library, which began in Spring 2018 under the direction of Perry, Dean, Rogers Architects and is set to reopen as Lutnick Library in Fall 2019. Beyond that, the college is in the early design stages of a new music building. =Haverford College Arboretum= Comprising the entire campus, the Haverford College Arboretum is the oldest collegiate arboretum in the United States. In 1834, a year after the college's founding, the English landscape gardener William Carvill was hired to design the plan for the campus. Carvill developed a design to replace the tilled fields, woodlots and pastures, using trees to frame and complement open spaces. He bordered the lanes with alle√©s of trees and planted groups of trees in odd numbers. Carvill also constructed grape arbors and a serpentine walk, reflecting the English landscape tradition of Sir Humphrey Repton. Carvill's mark is still evident today in the pastoral landscape which includes several original trees including a Swamp white oak, Quercus bicolor, and Bur oak, Quercus macrocarpa, on Founders Green. In 1901, a group of students and alumni formed the Campus Club to help preserve the campus landscape after discovering Carvill's original plan. Their work eventually led to the founding of the Haverford College Campus Arboretum Association (now the Haverford College Arboretum Association) in 1974, which continues to perpetuate Carvill's original design. To date, the arboretum's contain a nature trail, a pinetum with 300 different conifers, a duck pond, historic trees of diverse species, sculpture, as well as flower and Asian gardens. montage of the Haverford duck pond through the seasons.

The minute fraction who choose to seek other accommodations do so nearby in neighboring townships. Approximately 60% of faculty also reside on campus. Themed housing options include La Casa Hispanica, which \\"supports the endeavors of students actively engaged in organizing programs concerned with the cultures and civilizations of the Spanish-speaking world\\", the Ira de A. Reid House, which seeks students active in the Black Students' League or members of the African Diaspora interested in the culture and politics of Africans, Cadbury house, which provides a substance-free and quiet living environment, and Yarnall, which has no permanent theme. Various housing and room arrangements exist, including suites of singles, doubles, and triples. Student life Activities available at Haverford range from a cappella, sponsored music events, comedy groups, theater, an archery club, college radio, an award-winning Mock Trial team, bi-college news and fashion publications, an academic journal, an annual yearbook, to multiple community service groups. Haverford has no fraternities or sororities, but Drinker House is a social center for athletes. =Journalism= Student publications include The Bi-College News, a newspaper in collaboration with students at Bryn Mawr College that serves both campuses; The Clerk, an independent, online newspaper; Feathers & Fur, a fashion magazine also in collaboration with students at Bryn Mawr College; Milkweed, a student literary magazine; Without a (Noun), the Haverford satire/humor magazine; Body Text, an academic journal; Margin, a student-edited creative magazine; and The Record, the student yearbook.  Athletics  Haverford College competes at the NCAA Division III level in the Centennial Conference and has a rich history in collegiate athletics: Haverford boasts the only varsity cricket team in the United States; its men's and women's track and field and cross country teams are perennial powerhouses in their division, with men's cross country winning the 2010 Cross Country Division III National Championships; its men's soccer team is among the nation's oldest, having won its first intercollegiate match in 1905 against Harvard College, and in 2015 made it to quarterfinals of the NCCA Division III Championships; its fencing team has competed since the early 1930s and is a member of both the Middle Atlantic Collegiate Fencing Association (MACFA) and the National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association (NIWFA). Several athletic teams are highly competitive in the Centennial Conference; for example, women's basketball won the 2014 Centennial Conference Championship and progressed to the second round of the NCAA Division III Women's Basketball Tournament. Women's softball also won Centennial Conference titles in 2006, 2014, and in 2016. The 2016 team advanced to the Super Regional tournament, a first for any Centennial Conference softball team. Notable people Notable graduates of Haverford College include a number of prominent businessmen such as Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick (1983), co-founder of MBK Partners Michael Kim (1985), Palantir Technologies co-founder and CEO Alex Karp (1989), and former co- chairman of Goldman Sachs and United States Deputy Secretary of State John C. Whitehead (1943). Haverford also counts among its alumni one of the winners of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, George Smith (1963), Emmy award-winning journalist Juan Williams (1976), actor Daniel Dae Kim (1990), Nobel Peace Prize winner Philip Noel-Baker (1908), Pulitzer Prize-winning humor columnist Dave Barry (1969), editor-in-chief of Harvard Business Review Adi Ignatius (1981), Tony Award-winning playwright of Lend Me a Tenor and Crazy for You Ken Ludwig (1972), Pulitzer Prize winning journalist David Wessel (1975), composer Steven Gerber (1969), theoretical physicist Curtis Callan (1961), professional sports executive Arn Tellem (1976), former CEO of NPR Ken Stern (1985), tech entrepreneur James Kinsella (1982), and architect Gil Schafer III (1984).

The first book, Five on a Treasure Island, was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children ‚Äì Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George) ‚Äì and their dog Timmy. The stories take place in the children's school holidays after they have returned from their respective boarding schools. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure. Sometimes the scene is set close to George's family home at Kirrin Cottage in Dorset, such as the picturesque Kirrin Island, owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay. George's own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old and often contain secret passages or smugglers' tunnels. In some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. However, the settings are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages, islands, the English and Welsh countryside and sea shores, as well as an outdoor life of picnics, lemonade, bicycle trips and swimming. Blyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series, but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length Famous Five novels, as well as a number of other series in similar style following groups of children discovering crime on holiday in the countryside. By the end of 1953 more than six million copies had been sold. Today, more than two million copies of the books are sold each year, making them one of the best-selling series for children ever written, with sales totalling over a hundred million. All the novels have been adapted for television, and several have been adapted as films in various countries. Blyton's publisher, Hodder & Stoughton, first used the term \\"The Famous Five\\" in 1951, after nine books in the series had been published. Before this, the series was referred to as The 'Fives' Books. Characters=The five= *'''''' *: Julian is the oldest of the five, cousin to George and elder brother to Dick and Anne. He is tall, strong and intelligent as well as caring, responsible and kind. His cleverness and reliability are often noted by Aunt Fanny. He is the leader of the group and is very protective towards Anne and sometimes, to her frustration, towards George. Julian is the most mature of the group but, although well-meaning, his manner can at times come over as overbearing, pompous or priggish. At the start of the series, Julian is 12 years old. Over time, he reaches his goal of fully maturing into a young adult. *'''''' *:Dick has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, a year younger than his brother Julian and a year older than his sister Anne ‚Äì eleven at the start of the series. Though inclined to tease his sister at times, Dick is, like Julian, very caring towards Anne and does his best to keep her cheered up when she gets upset. He had a heroic role in Five on a Treasure Island. He uses his wits and saves the five in many adventures but probably has the least clearly-drawn character of the four cousins. *'''''' *:Georgina is a tomboy, demanding that people call her \\"George\\", and she cuts her hair very short and dresses like a boy. She is headstrong and courageous by nature and, like her father, scientist Quentin Kirrin, has a hot and fiery temper. Introduced to the other characters in the first book, she later attends a boarding school with Anne where the teachers too call her 'George'. Blyton eventually revealed that the character was based on herself. It is notable that the chief protagonist of the Malory Towers stories also possessed a fiery temper as a defining character trait.George has a loyal dog named Timmy who would do anything for her. She often gets cross when anyone calls her by her real name or makes fun of Timmy, and she loves it when somebody calls her George or mistakes her for a boy. In Five Get into a Fix, old Mrs Jones mistakes her for a boy: even though Julian had said to her that she was a girl, she later forgets this. George sometimes takes this to the point of asking that her name be prefixed with Master instead of Miss. Various references have been made to what meaning should be read into this ‚Äì for instance \\"I remember reading in my first Famous Five book about a girl called Master George. What a puzzle and thrill. She claims to never tell lies as that is cowardly.\\"More modern readers have interpreted that George had gender dysphoria, but Hugo Rifkind, writing in The Times, suggested that Blyton's conservatism meant that was not likely to have been intended. *'''''' *:Anne is the youngest in the group, and generally takes care of the domestic duties during the Five's various camping holidays. As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not really enjoy the adventures as much as the others. She is ten years old in the first book of the series. She sometimes lets her tongue run away with her, but ultimately she is as brave and resourceful as the others. She likes doing the domestic things such as planning, organising and preparing meals, and keeping where they are staying clean and tidy, be it a cave, house, tent or caravan. In Smugger's Top it is suggested she is claustrophobic, as she is frightened of enclosed spaces, which remind her of bad dreams. But the adventures invariably lead the five into tunnels, down wells, and into dungeons and other enclosed spaces, demonstrating how brave she really is. *'''''' *:Timmy is George's faithful dog. He is a large, brown mongrel with a long tail. George adopted him after finding him abandoned on the moors as a puppy. He is very friendly; he is clever, affectionate and loyal to the children and to George in particular; he provides physical protection for them many times. Timmy's presence is frequently given as the reason the children's parents allow them to wander unsupervised. George adores Timmy and thinks that he is the best dog in the world, and often becomes furious when people insult or threaten him. In the first book of the series, George's parents have forbidden her to keep Timmy, and she is forced to hide him with a fisher boy in the village. After the end of the Five's first adventure, her parents relent and she is allowed to keep him in the house and also take him with her to boarding school.It is a notable feature of the stories that Timmy's thoughts and feelings are frequently described. =Close friends= *'''''' *:Alf appears in most of the books set in Kirrin Cottage or at Kirrin Island. In the first book, after George's parents forbid her to keep the dog, Alf keeps Timmy for her. Timmy adores Alf. Alf also looks after George's boat. In later books Alf only looks after George's boat, as George's parents let Timmy stay in the house. Alf also appears as James of the same background. *'''''' *:Jo, clever but wild, joins the Five on several adventures near the end of the series. She is approximately the same age as the children and is a tomboy like George. Her parents were in the circus, but her mother left and her father was imprisoned for theft. She admires Dick and thinks the world of him. *'''''' *:Joanna is the housekeeper at George's house. She is an extremely kind woman who is often present at Kirrin Cottage when Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny go off somewhere. All the four cousins are extremely attached to her. She is sometimes referred to as Joan. =Family= *'''''' *:Fanny is George's mother, and aunt to Dick, Julian and Anne. She is married to Uncle Quentin, and is, through most of Blyton's Famous Five novels, the principal maternal figure in the lives of the children. She is a very kind and easy-going woman, and shows considerable patience with her husband over his short temper and absent-mindedness. *'''''' *:Quentin is George's father, and a world-famous scientist, who is kidnapped or held hostage in several of the children's adventures. He possesses a quick temper and has little tolerance for the children on school holidays, but is nevertheless a loving and caring husband, father and uncle, and is extremely proud of his daughter. He is also inclined to be very absent-minded, as he finds it hard to switch off from his work and readjust to everyday life. Despite his fame as a scientist, his work does not earn him much money. In the first book of the series, it is established that he is brother to the father of Julian, Dick and Anne. *'''''' *:Julian, Dick and Anne's mother is a very nice woman. In Five Go Off In a Caravan, she persuades the children's father to let them travel in the caravan. Critical discussion=Floating timeline= The seemingly perpetual youth of the Famous Five, who experience a world of apparently endless holidays while not ageing significantly, is known as a floating timeline. Floating timelines allow for an episodic series with no defined end-point, but at the expense of losing a sense of the characters growing up. J. K. Rowling commented of her Harry Potter series that she deliberately intended to avoid this in her writing: \\"in book four the hormones are going to kick in ‚Äì I don't want him stuck in a state of permanent pre- pubescence like poor Julian in the Famous Five!\\"Carey, Joanna, \\"Who hasn't met Harry?\\", The Guardian, 16 February 1999 Bibliography=Enid Blyton's \\"Famous Five\\" novel series= #Five on a Treasure Island (1942) #Five Go Adventuring Again (1943) #Five Run Away Together (1944) #Five Go to Smuggler's Top (1945) #Five Go Off in a Caravan (1946) #Five on Kirrin Island Again (1947) #Five Go Off to Camp (1948) #Five Get into Trouble (1949) #Five Fall into Adventure (1950) #Five on a Hike Together (1951) #Five Have a Wonderful Time (1952) #Five Go Down to the Sea (1953) #Five Go to Mystery Moor (1954) #Five Have Plenty of Fun (1955) #Five on a Secret Trail (1956) #Five Go to Billycock Hill (1957) #Five Get into a Fix (1958) #Five on Finniston Farm (1960) #Five Go to Demon's Rocks (1961) #Five Have a Mystery to Solve (1962) #Five Are Together Again (1963) Blyton also wrote a number of short stories featuring the characters, which were collected together in 1995 as Five Have a Puzzling Time, and Other Stories. =Other book series=Claude Voilier There are also books written originally in French by Claude Voilier (the Five have long been extremely popular in translation in the French-speaking parts of Europe) and later translated into English. The Voilier titles are: #Les Cinq sont les plus forts (1971; English title: The Famous Five and the Mystery of the Emeralds, English number: 2) #Les Cinq au bal des espions (1971; English title: The Famous Five in Fancy Dress, English number: 7) #Le Marquis appelle les Cinq (1972; English title: The Famous Five and the Stately Homes Gang, English number: 1) #Les Cinq au Cap des temp√™tes (1972; English title: The Famous Five and the Missing Cheetah, English number: 3) #Les Cinq √† la T√©l√©vision (1973; English title: The Famous Five Go on Television, English number: 4) #Les Cinq et les pirates du ciel (1973; English title: The Famous Five and the Hijackers, English number: 13) #Les Cinq contre le masque noir (1974; English title: The Famous Five Versus the Black Mask, English number: 6) #Les Cinq et le galion d'or (1974; English title: The Famous Five and the Golden Galleon, English number: 5) #Les Cinq font de la brocante (1975; English title: The Famous Five and the Inca God, English number: 9) #Les Cinq se mettent en quatre (1975; English title: The Famous Five and the Pink Pearls, English number: 18) #Les Cinq dans la cit√© secr√®te (1976; English title: The Famous Five and the Secret of the Caves, English number: 12) #La fortune sourit aux Cinq (1976; English title: The Famous Five and the Cavalier's Treasure, English number: 10) #Les Cinq et le rayon Z (1977; English title: The Famous Five and the Z-Rays, English number: 17) #Les Cinq vendent la peau de l'ours (1977; English title: The Famous Five and the Blue Bear Mystery, English number: 8) #Les Cinq aux rendez-vous du diable (1978; English title: The Famous Five in Deadly Danger, English number: 15) #Du neuf pour les Cinq (1978; English title: The Famous Five and the Strange Legacy, English number: 11) #Les Cinq et le tr√©sor de Roqu√©pine (1979; English title: The Famous Five and the Knights' Treasure, English Number: 16) #Les Cinq et le diamant bleu (1979; reprinted in 1980 as Les Cinq et le rubis d'Akbar; (The Five and the Rubies Of Akbar)) #Les Cinq jouent serr√© (1980; English title: The Famous Five and the Strange Scientist, English number: 14) #Les Cinq en croisi√®re (1980; never translated into English; \\"The Five on a Cruise\\") #Les Cinq contre les fant√¥mes (1981; never translated into English; \\"The Five Against the Ghosts\\") #Les Cinq en Amazonie (1983; never translated into English; \\"The Five in Amazonia\\") #Les Cinq et le tr√©sor du pirate (1984; never translated into English; \\"The Five and the Pirate's Treasure\\") #Les Cinq contre le loup-garou (1985; never translated into English; \\"The Five against the werewolf\\") The German \\"Geisterb√§nde\\" In Germany, two books came out with a questionable author. The titles are: # F√ºnf Freunde auf der verbotenen Insel (\\"Five Friends on the Forbidden Island\\") (1977) # F√ºnf Freunde und der blaue Diamant (\\"Five Friends and the Blue Diamond\\") (1979) Although Enid Blyton is named as author on the cover, the books were most likely written by German author Brigitte Blobel, who is credited as the translator. The books were recalled after the first edition owing to copyright issues, and are now rare and high-priced collector's items. Film and television adaptations Producers, actors, director and the dog Coffey at the Schleswig premiere of the movie F√ºnf Freunde (translated into English The Famous Five Friends) =Films= There exist two Children's Film Foundation films of the Famous Five books: Five on a Treasure Island, made in 1957, and Five Have a Mystery to Solve, produced in 1964. Two of the Famous Five stories by Enid Blyton have been filmed by Danish director Katrine Hedman. The cast consisted of Danish actors and were originally released in Danish. Ove Sprog√∏e stars as Uncle Quentin. The movies are: ' (Five and the Spies) (1969) and De 5 i fedtefadet (Famous Five Get in Trouble) (1970). All four of the films have been released on DVD in their respective countries. In 2012 the movie F√ºnf Freunde was released in Germany, with Marcus Harris in a small role. Now also F√ºnf Freunde 2, 3 and 4. =Television=1978‚Äì79 series Jennifer Thanisch as Anne, Michele Gallagher as Georgina, Gary Russell as Dick, Marcus Harris as Julian from Famous Five (1978‚Äì79) television series The Famous Five television series was produced by Southern Television and Portman Productions for ITV in the UK, in 26 episodes of thirty minutes (including time for advertisements). It starred Michele Gallagher as Georgina, Marcus Harris as Julian, Jennifer Thanisch as Anne, Gary Russell as Dick, Toddy Woodgate as Timmy, Michael Hinz as Uncle Quentin and Sue Best as Aunt Fanny. It also starred Ronald Fraser, John Carson, Patrick Troughton, James Villiers, Cyril Luckham and Brian Glover. The screenplays were written by Gloria Tors, Gail Renard, Richard Carpenter and Richard Sparks. The episodes were directed by Peter Duffell, Don Leaver, James Gatward and Mike Connor. The series was produced by Don Leaver and James Gatward. Most of the outdoor filming was done in the New Forest and parts of Dorset and Devon.The series was set in the present day, fifteen years after Blyton's last novel in the series. Of the original 21 novels, three were not adapted for this series; Five on a Treasure Island and Five Have a Mystery to Solve because the Children's Film Foundation still own the film and TV rights to the books, while Five Have Plenty of Fun did not fit in the production schedule. Due to the success of the series, Southern Television were keen to make another season of episodes, but the Enid Blyton estate forbade them to create original stories. The 1978 series was originally released on video by Portman Productions with reasonable regularity between 1983 and 1999, many of which are still easy to find second-hand, although the sound and picture quality is not always what it could be. A four- disc DVD collection, containing 23 of the 26 episodes produced for the 1978 series (and two episodes from the 1996 series) was released in region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in 2005. The box and disc art identify it as a release of the 1996 series. (The distributor had licensed the 1996 series, but due to an administrative glitch was supplied with master tapes and artwork for the 1978 series.) The error was corrected in a later release. A seven-DVD set containing the entire series and extensive bonus material was released in October 2010 in Germany by Koch Media; although there was an option to choose either the original English or German dubbed versions, the English version had non-removable German subtitles across the bottom of the screen on every episode. The same company released the DVD set in the UK (without the non- removable subtitles) on 25 June 2012. A four DVD set containing all 26 episodes, without additional content, was released for region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in late 2011, as Enid Blyton's The Famous Five: The Complete Collection. (The Finnish punk band Widows (of Helsinki) made three different cover versions of the theme song, the first in early 1979, as did the Irish indie outfit Fleur, in 1996.) 1995 series A later series, The Famous Five, initiated by Victor Glynn of Portman Zenith was aired first in 1995, a co-production between a number of companies including Tyne Tees Television, HTV, Zenith North and the German channel ZDF. Unlike the previous TV series, this set the stories in the 1950s, around when they were written. It dramatised all the original books. Of the juvenile actors the best known is probably Jemima Rooper, who played George. Julian was portrayed by Marco Williamson, Dick by Paul Child, and Anne by Laura Petela. In this series, because of the slang meaning of the word fanny, Aunt Fanny, played by Mary Waterhouse, was known as Aunt Frances. (In some but not all recent reprints of the book, the character has been re-christened Aunt Franny.) The 1995 series was released in its entirety on VHS video. A three-disc DVD collection, containing 13 of the 26 episodes of the 1995 series, was released in Australia and New Zealand in 2005, and is marked \\"Revised Edition\\" to avoid confusion with the previous release of the 1979 series with 1995 artwork. Other episodes have reportedly been released on DVD in Europe, but only the adaptation of Five on a Treasure Island was released on DVD in the UK. Famous 5: On the Case A new Famous Five animated TV series began airing in 2008. Famous 5: On the Case is set in modern times and features the children of the original Famous Five: Max (the son of Julian and Brandine), Dylan (son of Dick and Michelle), Jo (daughter of George and Ravi ‚Äì a tomboy who, like her mother, prefers a shorter name to her given name Jyoti) and Allie (daughter of Anne and John). It has not been stated whether their dog is a descendant of Timmy. The new series was first announced in 2005, and is a co-production of Chorion (which currently owns all Famous Five rights) and Marathon, in association with France 3 and The Disney Channel. Disney confirmed their involvement in December 2006. Stories were developed by Douglas Tuber and Tim Maile, who have previously written for Lizzie McGuire. Chorion claims on its website that \\"these new programmes will remain faithful to the themes of mystery and adventure central to Enid Blyton's classic series of books.\\" In total, there will be 130 episodes, each 22 minutes long. Other adaptations=Audio dramas= Hodder Headline produced in the late 1990s audio dramas in English, which were published on audio cassette and CD. All 21 episodes of the original books were dramatised. The 21 original stories by Enid Blyton have been released in the 70s as F√ºnf Freunde audio dramas in Germany as well. The speakers were the German dubbing artists for Gallagher, Thanisch, Russell and Harris, the leads of the first television series. For the sequels (not written by Blyton and decidedly more \\"modern\\" action-oriented stories) the speakers were replaced by younger ones, because it was felt that they sounded too mature. In addition to the original Blyton books, another 80+ stories have subsequently been released and published as radio plays and books in Germany. They are based on the original characters, but written by various German writers. =Theatre= A 1997 musical was made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Enid Blyton's birth with the title The Famous Five and later released on DVD as The Famous Five ‚Äì Smuggler's Gold ‚Äì The Musical. Principal actors: Elizabeth Marsland, Lyndon Ogbourne, Matthew Johnson, Vicky Taylor, Jon Lee, Director: Roz Storey and also in the five A brand new musical adaptation was premi√®red at the Tabard Theatre on 8 December 2009 and played until 10 January 2010. =Gamebooks= Two sets of gamebooks in a Choose Your Own Adventure style have been published. These books involve reading small sections of print and being given two or more options to follow, with a different page number for each option. The first series of these, written by Stephen Thraves, featured stories loosely based on the original books. They were issued in plastic wallets with accessories such as maps, dice and codebooks. The gamebooks were titled as follows: #The Wreckers' Tower Game, based on Five Go Down to the Sea #The Haunted Railway Game, based on Five Go Off to Camp #The Whispering Island Game, based on Five Have a Mystery to Solve #The Sinister Lake Game, based on Five On a Hike Together #The Wailing Lighthouse Game, based on Five Go to Demon's Rocks #The Secret Airfield Game, based on Five Go to Billycock Hill #The Shuddering Mountain Game, based on Five Get into a Fix #The Missing Scientist Game, based on Five Have a Wonderful Time The second series, written by Mary Danby, was entitled \\"The Famous Five and You\\". These consisted of abridged versions of the original text, with additional text for the alternative story routes. The books in this series were based on the first six original Famous Five books: #The Famous Five and You Search for Treasure! #The Famous Five and You Find Adventure! #The Famous Five and You Run Away! #The Famous Five and You Search for Smugglers! #The Famous Five and You Take Off! #The Famous Five and You Underground! =Video games= In 1990 an interactive fiction computer game based on the first of the books, Five on a Treasure Island, was released. It was programmed by Colin Jordan and first released for the SAM Coup√© by Enigma Variations. He originally started coding the game on the ZX Spectrum using his own \\"worldscape\\" technique. When the SAM Coup√© was launched, he switched to it as the target platform while still hosting the code on the ZX Spectrum. He later ported it to the Amstrad CPC and completed the ZX Spectrum version. The game was also ported to the Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST by others. In the late 1990s, German game publisher Ravensburger Interactive released 5 adventure games based on the franchise, titled Famous Five The Silver Tower, Famous Five Treasure Island, Famous Five ‚Äì Kidnapped, Famous Five ‚Äì Dangerous Discovery and Five on a Secret Mission for the PC or Mac. =Comics= Six comic albums drawn by Bernard Dufoss√© and scripted by Serge Rosenzweig and Rafael Carlo Marcello were released in France between 1982 and 1986, under the title Le Club des Cinq. Most of comic books in the series are based on Famous Five books created by Claude Voilier. Books were released by Hachette Livre. The first three of these volumes have also been released in English, under the name Famous Five. The titles included \\"Famous Five and the Golden Galleon\\" (which featured a sunken ship that was laden with gold with the Five fending off villains seeking to make off with the gold, \\"Famous Five and the Treasure of the Templars\\", where it transpires that Kirrin Castle is actually a Templar Castle that houses their hidden treasure which the Five ultimately secure with the help of members of the order, and \\"Famous Five and the Inca God\\" which was set in an antiquities museum and dealt with the theft of an Incan fetish. Beginning in September 1985 a series of monthly Comic Magazine titles Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine were published. Each issue published a full length illustrative comic book story adapted from Famous 5 Novels. The series came to end in the 1990s. Parodies The Five inspired the Comic Strip parody Five Go Mad in Dorset and its sequel Five Go Mad on Mescalin, in which the characters express sympathies with Nazi Germany and opposition to the Welfare State, homosexuals, immigrants and Jews, in an extremely broad parody not so much of Blyton but of wider perceived 1950s prejudices.Milmo, Cahill \\"Back for more jolly japes: the return of the Famous Five\\" The Independent, 5 December 2006 The parodies were deliberately set towards the end of the original Famous Five \\"era\\" (1942‚Äì63) so as to make the point that the books were already becoming outmoded while they were still being written. Both parodies made use of Famous Five set pieces, such as the surrender of the criminals at the end when Julian states \\"We're the Famous Five!\\", the arrival of the police just in the nick of time, and the appeal for \\"some of your home-made ices\\" at a village shop. Unlike the books, the four children in the Comic Strip parody are all siblings, and none is the child of Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin. The series was revived in 2012 with Five Go to Rehab, with the original cast reprising their roles, now well into middle-age. Reuniting for Dick's birthday after decades apart, the four and Toby lament how their lives took unexpected paths while Dick drags them on another bicycle adventure, which he had meticulously planned for fourteen years. In a reversal, George had married a series of wealthy men whom she cuckolded with, among others, one of her stepsons (her continuing penchant for bestiality with the latest Timmy is also implied); whereas Anne has become a strongly opinionated vegan spinster and is suspected by Dick of being a \\"dyke\\" ‚Äì an accusation made against George by Toby in the original Five Go Mad in Dorset. George and Julian have been committed to an alcoholics' sanatorium, the latter owes a large debt to African gangsters, and Anne recently served a prison sentence for setting her nanny aflame. Robbie Coltrane reprised both of his roles. Five Go to Rehab utilises a form of a floating timeline; although the original films' events are said to have taken place thirty years in the past and \\"five years after the war\\", the reunion film appears to be set approximately contemporaneous to its filming. Parodies began early: in 1964, only the year after the last book was published, John Lennon in his work In His Own Write had the short story The Famous Five through Woenow Abbey. Amidst a plethora of deliberate misspellings, he lists no fewer than ten members of the Five, not counting a dog named Cragesmure. A man warns them off Woenow Abbey and they subdue and question him. The story, like many other stories in this nonsense volume, stops there. Viz comic has parodied the series' style of writing and type of stories on a number of occasions, most notably in its Jack Black strip. In one such strip, Jack Black actually murders a group of young detectives clearly based on The Famous Five so they won't compete with him for a reward. In the late eighties, Australian comedy team The D-Generation parodied The Famous Five on their breakfast radio show as a five-part serial entitled The Famous Five Get Their Teeth Kicked In. The parody was based on the first book Five on a Treasure Island. The fourth short story in Fearsome Tales for Fiendish Kids by Jamie Rix is named \\"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\\", which is about four children in 1952 on a picnic in Kent during the summer holidays. After their nap, the youngest wants an apple to eat so the children decide to steal from a nearby orchard, but they are caught by the owner, who is armed with a shotgun. It was later adapted for the Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids cartoon, which aired on CITV in 2000. A 2005 story in The Guardian also parodies the Famous Five. It argues that Anne, Dick, George and Julian are caricatures rather than characters, portraying Anne as having no life outside of domestic labour. It highlights what the writer, Lucy Mangan, considers to be the power struggle between Dick, George and Julian while Anne is sidelined.Mangan, Lucy The Famous Five ‚Äì in their own words The Guardian, 22 December 2005 On 31 October 2009, the BBC programme The Impressions Show featured a sketch in which Ross Kemp meets The Famous Five. It was a parody of his hugely successful Sky One show, Ross Kemp on Gangs. British comedian John Finnemore did a radio sketch in which Julian and George run into each other as adults and reminisce. It is revealed that Julian has gone on to a career as a smuggler and regularly has to deal with copycat groups of children trying to thwart his plans. George is a happily married mother, Dick has gone to live in a commune in America, and Anne has just been released from prison having murdered a man with a ginger beer bottle. Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls features \\"The Famous Five Go Pillaging\\", ‚Äì a short story which parodies the writing style of Enid Blyton; five children witness the collapse of Roman imperialism and their friends and family are slaughtered by 9000 invading Vikings. Website The Daily Mash reported a lost Blyton manuscript titled \\"Five Go Deporting Gypsies\\". A spoof series of five books written by Bruno Vincent was published in November 2016. The books are titled Five Give Up the Booze, Five Go Gluten Free, Five Go On A Strategy Away Day, Five Go Parenting and Five on Brexit Island. Vincent went on to write several more titles in the series: Five at the Office Christmas Party, Five Get Gran Online, Five Get On the Property Ladder, Five Go Bump in the Night, Five Escape Brexit Island, Five Get Beach Body Ready, Five Lose Dad in the Garden Centre, and Five Forget Mother's Day. In Nov 2017, Return to Kirrin was released, written by Neil and Suzy Howlett. Set in 1979, it involves the Five (now middle-aged) reuniting on Kirrin Island, to discuss Julian's plans to develop Kirrin into a theme resort. Julian has become a successful stockbroker, Dick is a well-meaning but inept and overweight policeman, Anne is a worrisome housewife, and George is a feminist community worker (with her flatulent bulldog Gary in tow). Adventures then ensue, involving a host of other original characters.

Cuniculture is also employed by rabbit fanciers and hobbyists in the development and betterment of rabbit breeds and the exhibition of those efforts. Scientists practice cuniculture in the use and management of rabbits as model organisms in research. Cuniculture has been practiced all over the world since at least the 5th century. History=Early husbandry= An abundance of ancient rabbits may have played a part in the naming of Spain. Phoenician sailors visiting its coast around the 12th century BC mistook the European rabbit for the familiar rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) of their homeland. They named their discovery , meaning 'land [or island] of hyraxes'. A theory exists (though it is somewhat controversial) that a corruption of this name used by the Romans became Hispania, the Latin name for the Iberian Peninsula. Domestication of the European rabbit rose slowly from a combination of game- keeping and animal husbandry. Among the numerous foodstuffs imported by sea to Rome during her domination of the Mediterranean were shipments of rabbits from Spain. Romans also imported ferrets for rabbit hunting, and the Romans then distributed rabbits and the habit of rabbit keeping to the rest of Italy, to France, and then across the Roman Empire, including the British Isles. Rabbits were kept in both walled areas as well as more extensively in game-preserves. In the British Isles, these preserves were known as warrens or , and rabbits were known as , to differentiate them from the similar hares. The term warren was also used as a name for the location where hares, partridges and pheasants were kept, under the watch of a game keeper called a warrener. In order to confine and protect the rabbits, a wall or thick hedge might be constructed around the warren, or a warren might be established on an island. A warrener was responsible for controlling poachers and other predators and would collect the rabbits with snares, nets, hounds (such as greyhounds), or by hunting with ferrets. With the rise of falconry, hawks and falcons were also used to collect rabbits and hares. =Domestication= While under the warren system, rabbits were managed and harvested, but not domesticated. The practice of rabbit domestication also came from Rome. Christian monasteries throughout Europe and the Middle East kept rabbits since at least the 5th century. While rabbits might be allowed to wander freely within the monastery walls, a more common method was the employment of rabbit courts or rabbit pits. A rabbit court was a walled area lined with brick and cement, while a pit was similar, although less well-lined and more sunken. Individual boxes or burrow-spaces could line the wall. Rabbits would be kept in a group in these pits or courts, and individuals collected when desired for eating or pelts. Rabbit keepers transferred rabbits to individual hutches or pens for easy cleaning, handling, or for selective breeding, as pits did not allow keepers to perform these tasks. Hutches or pens were originally made of wood, but are now more frequently made of metal in order to allow for better sanitation. =Early breeds= 245px Rabbits were typically kept as part of the household livestock by peasants and villagers throughout Europe. Husbandry of the rabbits, including collecting weeds and grasses for fodder, typically fell to the children of the household or farmstead. These rabbits were largely 'common' or 'meat' rabbits and not of a particular breed, although regional strains and types did arise. Some of these strains remain as regional breeds, such as the Gotland of Sweden, while others, such as the Land Kaninchen, a spotted rabbit of Germany, have become extinct. Another rabbit type that standardized into a breed was the Brabancon, a meat rabbit of the region of Limbourg and what is now Belgium. Rabbits of this breed were bred for the Ostend port market, destined for London markets. The development of the refrigerated shipping vessels led to the eventual collapse of the European meat rabbit trade, as the over-populated feral rabbits in Australia could now be harvested and sold. The Brabancon is now considered extinct, although a descendant, the Dutch breed, remains a popular small rabbit for the pet trade. In addition to being harvested for meat, properly prepared rabbit pelts were also an economic factor. Both wild rabbits and domestic rabbit pelts were valued, and it followed that pelts of particular rabbits would be more highly prized. As far back as 1631, price differentials were noted between ordinary rabbit pelts and the pelts of quality 'riche' rabbit in the Champagne region of France. (This regional type would go on to be recognized as the , the 'silver rabbit of Champagne'.) Among the earliest of the commercial breeds was the Angora, which some say may have developed in the Carpathian Mountains. They made their way to England, where during the rule of King Henry VIII, laws banned the exportation of long-haired rabbits as they were a national treasure. In 1723, long haired rabbits were imported to southern France by English sailors, who described the animals as originally coming from the Angora region of Turkey. Thus two distinct strains arose, one in France and one in England. =Expansion around the globe= European explorers and sailors took rabbits with them to new ports around the world, and brought new varieties back to Europe and England with them. With the second voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1494, European domestic livestock were brought to the New World. Rabbits, along with goats and other hardy livestock, were frequently released on islands to produce a food supply for later ships. The importations occasionally met with disastrous results, such as in the devastation in Australia. While cattle and horses were used across the socio-economic spectrum, and especially were concentrated among the wealthy, rabbits were kept by lower-income classes and peasants. This is reflected in the names given to the breeds that eventually arose in the colonized areas. From the Santa Duromo mountains of Brazil comes the Rustico, which is known in the United States as the Brazilian rabbit. The Criollo rabbit comes from Mexico. =International commercial use= With the rise of scientific animal breeding in the late 1700s, led by Robert Bakewell (among others), distinct livestock breeds were developed for specific purposes. A wagon-load of rabbit skins in 320px Rabbits were among the last of the domestic animals to have these principles applied to them, but the rabbit's rapid reproductive cycle allowed for marked progress towards a breeding goal in a short period of time. Additionally, rabbits could be kept on a small area, with a single person caring for over 300 breeding does on an acre of land. Rabbit breeds were developed by individuals, cooperatives, and by national breeding centers. To meet various production goals, rabbits were exported around the world. One of the most notable import events was the introduction of the Belgian Hare breed of rabbit from Europe to the United States, beginning in 1888. This led to a short-lived \\"boom\\" in rabbit breeding, selling, and speculation, when a quality breeding animal could bring $75 to $200. (For comparison, the average daily wage at the time was approximately $1.) In 1900, a single animal-export company recorded 6,000 rabbits successfully shipped to the United States and Canada. Meat-type rabbits were raised for supplementary food in the 350px Science played another role in rabbit raising, this time with rabbits themselves as the tools used for scientific advancement. Beginning with Louis Pasteur's experiments in rabies in the later half of the nineteenth century, rabbits have been used as models to investigate various medical and biological problems, including the transmission of disease and protective antiserums. Production of quality animals for meat sale and scientific experimentation has driven a number of advancements in rabbit husbandry and nutrition. While early rabbit keepers were limited to local and seasonal foodstuffs, which did not permit the maximization of production, health or growth, by 1930 researchers were conducting experiments in rabbit nutrition, similar to the experiments that had isolated vitamins and other nutritional components. This eventually resulted in the development of various recipes for pelleted rabbit diets. Gradual refinement of diets has resulted in the widespread availability of pelleted feeds, which increase yield, reduce waste, and promote rabbit health, particularly maternal breeding health. =Rise of the fancy= The final leg of rabbit breeding--beyond meat, wool, fur, and laboratory use--was the breeding of 'fancy' animals as pets and curiosities. The term 'fancy' was originally applied to long-eared 'lop' rabbits, as they were the first type to be bred for exhibition. 210px Such rabbits were first admitted to agricultural shows in England in the 1820s, and in 1840 a club was formed for the promotion and regulation of exhibitions for \\"Fancy Rabbits\\". In 1918, a new group formed to promote the fur breeds, originally just the Beveren and Havana breeds. This club eventually expanded to become the British Rabbit Council. Meanwhile, in the United States, clubs promoting various breeds were chartered in the 1880s, and the National Pet Stock Association was formed in 1910. This organization would become the American Rabbit Breeders Association. Thousands of rabbit shows take place each year and are sanctioned in Canada, Mexico, Malaysia, Indonesia and the United States by ARBA. With the advent of national-level organizations, rabbit breeders had a framework for establishing breeds and varieties utilizing recognized standards, and breeding for rabbit exhibitions began to expand rapidly. Such organizations and associations were also established across Europe--most notably in Germany, France, and Scandinavia-- allowing for the recognition of local breeds (many of which shared similar characteristics across national borders) and for the preservation of stock during disruptions such as World WarI and World WarII. Closely overlapping with breeding for exhibition and for fur has been the breeding of rabbits for the pet trade. While rabbits have been kept as companions for centuries, the sale of rabbits as pets began to rise in the last half of the twentieth century. This may have been, in part, because rabbits require less physical space than dogs or cats, and do not require a specialized habitat like goldfish. Several breeds of rabbit--such as the Holland Lop, the Polish, the Netherland Dwarf, and the Lionhead--have been specifically bred for the pet trade. Traits common to many popular pet breeds are small size, \\"dwarf\\" (or neotenic) features, plush or fuzzy coats, and an array of coat colors and patterns. =Modern farming= Outside of the exhibition circles, rabbit raising remained a small-scale but persistent household and farm endeavor, in many locations unregulated by the rules that governed the production of larger livestock. With the ongoing urbanization of populations worldwide, rabbit raising gradually declined, but saw resurgences in both Europe and North America during World WarII, in conjunction with victory gardens. Eventually, farmers across Europe and in the United States began to approach cuniculture with the same scientific principles as had already been applied to the production of grains, poultry, and hoofed livestock. National agriculture breeding stations were established to improve local rabbit strains and to introduce more productive breeds. National breeding centers focused on developing strains for production purposes, including meat, pelts, and wool. 240px These gradually faded from prominence in the United States, but remained viable longer in Europe. Meanwhile, rabbit raising for local markets gained prominence in developing nations as an economical means of producing protein. Various aid agencies promote the use of rabbits as livestock. The animals are particularly useful in areas where women are limited in employment outside the household, because rabbits can be kept successfully in small areas. These same factors have contributed to the increased popularity of rabbits as \\"backyard livestock\\" among locavores and homesteaders in more developed countries in North America and Europe. The addition of rabbits to the watchlist of endangered heritage breeds that is kept by The Livestock Conservancy has also led to increased interest from livestock conservationists. In contrast, throughout Asia (and particularly in China) rabbits are increasingly being raised and sold for export around the world. The World Rabbit Science Association (WRSA), formed in 1976, was established \\"to facilitate in all possible ways the exchange of knowledge and experience among persons in all parts of the world who are contributing to the advancement of the various branches of the rabbit industry\\". The WRSA organizes a world conference every four years. =Present day (2000‚Äìpresent)= Cuniculture at a small farm in Cuba (2015) Approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. In more recent years and in some countries, cuniculture has come under pressure from animal rights activists on several fronts. The use of animals, including rabbits, in scientific experiments has been subject to increased scrutiny in developed countries. Increasing regulation has raised the cost of producing animals for this purpose, and made other experimental options more attractive. Other researchers have abandoned investigations which required animal models. Meanwhile, various rescue groups under the House Rabbit Society umbrella have taken an increasingly strident stance against any breeding of rabbits (even as food in developing countries) on the grounds that it contributes to the number of mistreated, unwanted or abandoned animals. 190px The growth of homesteaders and smallholders has led to the rise of visibility of rabbit raisers in geographic areas where they have not been previously present. This has led to zoning conflicts over the regulation of butchering and waste management. Conflicts have also arisen with House Rabbit Society organizations as well as ethical vegetarians and vegans concerning the use of rabbits as meat and fur animals rather than as pets. Conversely, many homesteaders cite concern with animal welfare in intensive farming of beef, pork and poultry as a significant factor in choosing to raise rabbits for meat. The specific future direction of cuniculture is unclear, but does not appear to be in danger of disappearing in any particular part of the world. The variety of applications, as well as the versatile utility of the species, appears sufficient to keep rabbit raising a going concern in one aspect or another around the planet. Aspects of rabbit production=Meat rabbits= Rabbits have been raised for meat production in a variety of settings around the world. Smallholder or backyard operations remain common in many countries, while large-scale commercial operations are centered in Europe and Asia. For the smaller enterprise, multiple local rabbit breeds may be easier to use.Butchering rabbits in 400px Many local, \\"rustico\\", landrace or other heritage type breeds may be used only in a specific geographic area. Sub-par or \\"cull\\" animals from other breeding goals (laboratory, exhibition, show, wool, or pet) may also be used for meat, particularly in smallholder operations. Counterintuitively, the giant rabbit breeds are rarely used for meat production, due to their extended growth rates (which lead to high feed costs) and their large bone size (which reduces the percentage of their weight that is usable meat). Dwarf breeds, too, are rarely used, due to the high production costs, slow growth, and low offspring rate. In contrast to the multitude of breeds and types used in smaller operations, breeds such as the New Zealand and the Californian, along with hybrids of these breeds, are most frequently utilized for meat in commercial rabbitries. The primary qualities of good meat-rabbit breeding stock are growth rate and size at slaughter, but also good mothering ability. Specific lines of commercial breeds have been developed that maximize these qualities ‚Äì rabbits may be slaughtered as early as seven weeks and does of these strains routinely raise litters of 8 to 12 kits. Other breeds of rabbit developed for commercial meat production include the Florida White and the Altex. 280px Rabbit breeding stock raised in France is particularly popular with meat rabbit farmers internationally, some being purchased as far away as China in order to improve the local rabbit herd. Larger-scale operations attempt to maximize income by balancing land use, labor required, animal health, and investment in infrastructure. Specific infrastructure and strain qualities depend on the geographic area. An operation in an urban area may emphasize odor control and space utilization by stacking cages over each other with automatic cleaning systems that flush away faeces and urine. In rural sub-tropical and tropical areas, temperature control becomes more of an issue, and the use of air-conditioned buildings is common in many areas. Breeding schedules for rabbits vary by individual operation. Prior to the development of modern balanced rabbit rations, rabbit breeding was limited by the nutrition available to the doe. Without adequate calories and protein, the doe would either not be fertile, would abort or resorb the foetuses during pregnancy, or would deliver small numbers of weak kits. Under these conditions, a doe would be re-bred only after weaning her last litter when the kits reached the age of two months. This allowed for a maximum of four litters per year. Advances in nutrition, such as those published by the USDA Rabbit Research Station, resulted in greater health for breeding animals and the survival of young stock. Likewise, offering superior, balanced nutrition to growing kits allowed for better health and less illness among slaughter animals. Current practices include the option of re-breeding the doe within a few days of delivery (closely matching the behavior of wild rabbits during the spring and early summer, when forage availability is at its peak.) This can result in up to eight or more litters annually. A doe of ideal meat-stock genetics can produce five times her body weight in fryers a year. Criticism of the more intensive breeding schedules has been made on the grounds that re-breeding that closely is excessively stressful for the doe. Determination of health effects of breeding schedules is made more difficult by the domestic rabbit's reproductive physiology ‚Äì in contrast to several other mammal species, rabbits are more likely to develop uterine cancer when not used for breeding than when bred frequently. 180px In efficient production systems, rabbits can turn 20 percent of the proteins they eat into edible meat, compared to 22 to 23 percent for broiler chickens, 16 to 18 percent for pigs and 8 to 12 percent for beef; rabbit meat is more economical in terms of feed energy than beef. \\"Rabbit fryers\\" are rabbits that are between 70 and 90 days old, weighing in live weight. \\"Rabbit roasters\\" are rabbits from 90 days to 6 months old, weighing in live weight. \\"Rabbit stewers\\" are rabbits 6 months or older, weighing over . \\"Dark fryers\\" (i.e., any color other than white) typically garner a lower price than \\"white fryers\\" (also called \\"albino fryers\\"), because of the slightly darker tinge to the meat. (Purely pink carcasses are preferred by most consumers.) Dark fryers are also harder to de- hide (skin) than white fryers. In the United States, white fryers garner the highest prices per pound of live weight. In Europe, however, a sizable market remains for the dark fryers that come from older and larger rabbits. In the kitchen, dark fryers are typically prepared differently from white fryers. In 1990, the world's annual production of rabbit meat was estimated to be 1.5 million tons. In 2014, the number was estimated at 2 million tons. China is among the world's largest producers and consumers of rabbit meat, accounting for some 30% of the world's total consumption. Within China itself, rabbits are raised in many provinces, with most of the rabbit meat (about 70% of the national production, equaling some 420,000 tons annually) being consumed in the Sichuan Basin (Sichuan Province and Chongqing), where it is particularly popular. Well-known chef Mark Bittman wrote that domesticated rabbit \\"tastes like chicken\\", because both are \\"blank palettes on which we can layer whatever flavors we like\\". =Wool rabbits and pelt rabbits=Wool rabbits Rabbits such as the Angora, American Fuzzy Lop, and Jersey Wooly produce wool. However, since the American Fuzzy Lop and Jersey Wooly are both dwarf breeds, only the much larger Angora breeds such as the English Angora, Satin Angora, Giant Angora, and French Angora are used for commercial wool production. Their long fur is sheared, combed, or plucked (gently pulling loose hairs from the body during molting) and then spun into yarn used to make a variety of products. Angora sweaters can be purchased in many clothing stores and is generally mixed with other types of wool. In 2010, 70% of Angora rabbit wool was produced in China. Rabbit wool, generically called Angora, is 5 times warmer than sheep's wool. Fur rabbits 150px A number of rabbit breeds have been developed with the fur trade in mind. Breeds such as the Rex, Satin, and Chinchilla are often raised for their fur. Each breed has fur characteristics and all have a wide range of colors and patterns. \\"Fur\\" rabbits are fed a diet especially balanced for fur production and the pelts are harvested when they have reached prime condition. Rabbit fur is widely used throughout the world. China imports much of its fur from Scandinavia (80%), and some from North America (5%), according to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service GAIN Report CH7607. =Exhibition rabbits= Many rabbit keepers breed their rabbits for competition among other purebred rabbits of the same breed. Rabbits are judged according to the standards put forth by the governing associations of the particular country. These associations, being made up of people, may be distinctly political and reflect the preferences of particular persons on the governing boards. However, as mechanisms to preserve rare rabbit breeds, foster communication between breeders and encourage the education of the public, these organizations are invaluable. Examples include the American Rabbit Breeders Association and the British Rabbit Council. =Laboratory rabbits= 310px Rabbits have been and continue to be used in laboratory work such as production of antibodies for vaccines and research of human male reproductive system toxicology. Experiments with rabbits date back to Louis Pasteur's work in France in the 1800s. In 1972, around 450,000 rabbits were used for experiments in the United States, decreasing to around 240,000 in 2006. The Environmental Health Perspective, published by the National Institute of Health, states, \\"The rabbit [is] an extremely valuable model for studying the effects of chemicals or other stimuli on the male reproductive system.\\" According to the Humane Society of the United States, rabbits are also used extensively in the study of asthma, stroke prevention treatments, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, and cancer. Rabbit cultivation intersects with research in two ways: first, the keeping and raising of animals for testing of scientific principles. Some experiments require the keeping of several generations of animals treated with a particular drug, in order to fully appreciate the side effects of that drug. There is also the matter of breeding and raising animals for experiments. The New Zealand White is one of the most commonly used breeds for research and testing. Specific strains of the New Zealand White have been developed, with differing resistance to disease and cancers. Additionally, some experiments call for the use of 'specific pathogen free' animals, which require specific husbandry and intensive hygiene. Animal rights activists generally oppose animal experimentation for all purposes, and rabbits are no exception. The use of rabbits for the Draize test, which is used for, amongst other things, testing cosmetics on animals, has been cited as an example of cruelty in animal research. Albino rabbits are typically used in the Draize tests because they have less tear flow than other animals and the lack of eye pigment make the effects easier to visualize. Rabbits in captivity are uniquely subject to rabbitpox, a condition that has not been observed in the wild. Husbandry Modern methods for housing domestic rabbits vary from region to region around the globe and by type of rabbit, technological or financial opportunities and constraints, intended use, number of animals kept, and the particular preferences of the owner or farmer. Various goals include maximizing number of animals per land unit (especially common in areas with high land values or small living areas) minimizing labor, reducing cost, increasing survival and health of animals, and meeting specific market requirements (such as for clean wool, or rabbits raised on pasture). Not all of these goals are complementary. Where the keeping of rabbits has been regulated by governments, specific requirements have been put in place. Various industries also have commonly accepted practices which produce predictable results for that type of rabbit product.

Specifically as relates to rabbits, this type of production was nearly universal prior to germ theory understanding of infectious parasites (especially coccidia) and the role of nutrition in prevention of abortion and reproductive loss. The most extensive rabbit \\"keeping\\" methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market, such as occurred in Australia prior to the 1990s. Warren-based cuniculture is somewhat more controlled, as the animals are generally kept to a specific area and a limited amount of supplemental feeding provided. Finally, various methods of raising rabbits with pasture as the primary food source have been developed. Pasturing rabbits within a fence (but not a cage), also known as colony husbandry, has not been commonly pursued due to the high death rate from weather and predators. More commonly (but still rare in terms of absolute numbers of rabbits and practitioners) is the practice of confining the rabbits to a moveable cage with an open or slatted floor so that the rabbits can access grass but still be kept at hand and protected from weather and predators. This method of growing rabbits does not typically result in an overall reduction for the need for supplemented feed. The growing period to market weight is much longer for grass fed rather than pellet fed animals, and many producers continue to offer small amounts of complete rations over the course of the growing period. Hutches or cages for this type of husbandry are generally made of a combination of wood and metal wire, made portable enough for a person to move the rabbits daily to fresh ground, and of a size to hold a litter of 6 to 12 rabbits at the market weight of . Protection from sun and driving rain are important health concerns, as is durability against predator attacks and the ability to be cleaned to prevent loss from coccidiosis. Medical care and the use of medicated feed are less common. =Intensive cuniculture practices= Rabbits being raised on pasture in moveable enclosures at 240pxIntensive cuniculture is more focused, efficient, and time-sensitive, utilizing a greater density of animals and higher turnover. The labor required to produce each harvested hide, kilogram of wool, or market fryer--and the quality thereof--may be higher or lower than for extensive methods. Successful operations raising healthy rabbits that produce durable goods range from thousands of animals to less than a dozen. Simple hutches, kitchen floors, and even natural pits may provide shelter from the elements, while the rabbits are fed from the garden or given what can be gathered as they grow to produce a community's foodstuffs and textiles. Intensive cuniculture can also be practiced in an enclosed, climate controlled barn where rows of cages house robust rabbits eating pellets and treats before a daily health inspection or weekly weight check. Veterinary specialists and biosecurity may be part of large-scale operations, while individual rabbits in smaller setups may receive better--or worse--care. =Challenges to successful production= Specific challenges to the keeping of rabbits vary by specific practices. Losses from coccidiosis are much more common when rabbits are kept on the ground (such as in warrens or colonies) or on solid floors than when in wire or slat cages that keep rabbits elevated away from urine and faeces. Pastured rabbits are more subject to predator attack. Rabbits kept indoors at an appropriate temperature rarely suffer heat loss compared to rabbits housed outdoors in summer. At the same time, if rabbits are housed inside without adequate ventilation, respiratory disease can be a significant cause of illness and death. Production does on fodder are rarely able to raise more than 3 litters a year without heavy losses from deaths of weak kits, abortion, and fetal resorption, all related to poor nutrition and inadequate protein intake. In contrast, rabbits fed commercial pelleted diets can face losses related to low fiber intake. Exhibition and fancier societies A Checkered Giant at an exhibition In the early 1900s, as animal fancy in general began to emerge, rabbit fanciers began to sponsor rabbit exhibitions and fairs in Western Europe and the United States. What became known as the \\"Belgian Hare Boom\\" began with the importation of the first Belgian Hares from England in 1888 and soon after the founding of the first rabbit club in America, the American Belgian Hare Association. From 1898 to 1901, many thousands of Belgian Hares were imported to America. Today, the Belgian Hare is considered one of the rarest breeds, with less than 200 in the United States as reported in a recent survey. The American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) was founded in 1910 and is the national authority on rabbit raising and rabbit breeds, having a uniform \\"Standard of Perfection\\", registration and judging system. =Conformation shows= Showing rabbits is an increasingly popular activity. Showing rabbits helps to improve the vigor and physical behavior of each breed through competitive selection. County fairs are common venues through which rabbits are shown in the United States. Rabbit clubs at local state and national levels hold many shows each year. On any given weekend, one may be able to find a show in most regions of the United States and the United Kingdom. Although only purebred animals are shown, a pedigree is not required to enter a rabbit in an ARBA-sanctioned show but is required to register the rabbit with ARBA. A rabbit must be registered in order to receive a Grand Champion certificate. Children's clubs such as 4H also include rabbit shows, usually in conjunction with county fairs. The ARBA holds an annual national convention which has as many as 25,000 animals competing from all over the world. The mega show moves to a different city each year. The ARBA also sponsors youth programs for families as well as underprivileged rural and inner city children to learn responsible care and breeding of domestic rabbits. Genetics The study of rabbit genetics is of interest to medical researchers, fanciers, and the fur and meat industries. Each of these groups has different needs for genetic information. In the biomedical research community and the pharmaceutical industry, rabbits genetics are important for producing antibodies, testing toxicity of consumer products, and in model organism research. Among rabbit fanciers and in the fiber and fur industry, the genetics of coat color and hair properties are paramount. The meat industry relies on genetics for disease resistance, feed conversion ratio, and reproduction potential. The rabbit genome has been sequenced and is publicly available. The mitochondrial DNA has also been sequenced. In 2011, parts of the rabbit genome were re-sequenced in greater depth in order to expose variation within the genome. =Gene linkage maps= 215px 215px 215px The early genetic research focused on linkage distance between various gross phenotypes using linkage analysis. Between 1924 and 1941, the relationship between c, y, b, du, En, l, r1, r2, A, dw, w, f, and br was established (phenotype is listed below). :*c: albino :*y: yellow fat :*du: Dutch coloring :*En: English coloring :*l: angora :*r1, r2: rex genes :*A: Agouti :*dw: dwarf gene :*w: wide intermediate-color band :*f: furless :*br: brachydactyly The distance between these genes is as follows, numbered by chromosome.

They are A, B, C, D, E, En, Du, P, Si, V, and W. Each locus has dominant and recessive genes. In addition to the loci there are also modifiers, which modify a certain gene. These include the rufous modifiers, color intensifiers, and plus/minus (blanket/spot) modifiers. A rabbit's coat has either two pigments (pheomelanin for yellow, and eumelanin for dark brown) or no pigment (for an albino rabbit). Within each group, the genes are listed in order of dominance, with the most dominant gene first. In parenthesis after the description is at least one example of a color that displays this gene. 215px brindling (harlequin))215px 215px 215px :Note: lower case are recessive and capital letters are dominant *\\"A\\" represents the agouti locus (multiple bands of color on the hair shaft).

It is bordered in the north by Ecuador and Colombia, in the east by Brazil, in the southeast by Bolivia, in the south by Chile, and in the west by the Pacific Ocean. Peru is a megadiverse country with habitats ranging from the arid plains of the Pacific coastal region in the west to the peaks of the Andes mountains vertically extending from the north to the southeast of the country to the tropical Amazon Basin rainforest in the east with the Amazon river. At 1.28 million km2 (0.5 million mi2), Peru is the 19th largest country in the world, and the third largest in South America. Peruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures. Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BCE, the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization, to the Inca Empire, the largest state in pre-Columbian America, the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 4th millennia BCE. The Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American territories, with its capital in Lima. Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821, and following the foreign military campaigns of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, and the decisive battle of Ayacucho, Peru completed its independence in 1824. In the ensuing years, the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability, which ended shortly before the War of the Pacific (1879-1884) with Chile. Throughout the 20th century, Peru endured armed territorial disputes, coups, social unrest, and internal conflicts, as well as periods of stability and economic upswing. Alberto Fujimori was elected to the presidency in 1990; his government was credited with economically stabilizing Peru and successfully ending the Shining Path insurgency, though he was widely accused of human rights violations and suppression of political dissent. Fujimori left the presidency in 2000 and was charged with human rights violations and imprisoned until his pardon by President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski in 2017. Even after the president's regime, Fujimori's followers, called Fujimoristas, have caused political turmoil for any opposing faction in power, even causing Pedro Pablo Kuczynski to resign in March 2018. The sovereign state of Peru is a representative democratic republic divided into 25 regions. Peru is a developing country, ranking 82nd on the Human Development Index, with a high level of human development with an upper middle income level and a poverty rate around 19 percent. It is one of the region's most prosperous economies with an average growth rate of 5.9% and it has one of the world's fastest industrial growth rates at an average of 9.6%. Its main economic activities include mining, manufacturing, agriculture and fishing; along with other growing sectors such as telecommunications and biotechnology. The country forms part of The Pacific Pumas, a political and economic grouping of countries along Latin America's Pacific coast that share common trends of positive growth, stable macroeconomic foundations, improved governance and an openness to global integration. Peru ranks high in social freedom;\\"Freedom in the World 2017 ‚Äì Populists and Autocrats: The Dual Threat to Global Democracy\\" by Freedom House, 31 January 2017 it is an active member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Pacific Alliance, the Trans- Pacific Partnership and the World Trade Organization; and is considered as a middle power. Peru has a population of 32 million, which includes Amerindians, Europeans, Africans and Asians. The main spoken language is Spanish, although a significant number of Peruvians speak Quechua or other indigenous languages. This mixture of cultural traditions has resulted in a wide diversity of expressions in fields such as art, cuisine, literature, and music.  Etymology  The name of the country may be derived from Bir√∫, the name of a local ruler who lived near the Bay of San Miguel, Panama City, in the early 16th century.Porras Barrenechea, Ra√∫l. El nombre del Per√∫. Lima: Talleres Gr√°ficos P.L. Villanueva, 1968, p. 83. Spanish conquistadors, who arrived in 1522, believed this was the southernmost part of the New World.Ra√∫l Porras Barrenechea, El nombre del Per√∫, p. 84. When Francisco Pizarro invaded the regions farther south, they came to be designated Bir√∫ or Per√∫.Ra√∫l Porras Barrenechea, El nombre del Per√∫, p. 86. An alternative history is provided by the contemporary writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, son of an Inca princess and a conquistador. He said the name Bir√∫ was that of a common Indian happened upon by the crew of a ship on an exploratory mission for governor Pedro Arias de √Åvila, and went on to relate more instances of misunderstandings due to the lack of a common language.Vega, Garcilasco, Commentarios Reales de los Incas, Editorial Mantaro, Lima, ed. 1998. pp. 14‚Äì15. First published in Lisbon in 1609. The Spanish Crown gave the name legal status with the 1529 Capitulaci√≥n de Toledo, which designated the newly encountered Inca Empire as the province of Peru.Ra√∫l Porras Barrenechea, El nombre del Per√∫, p. 87. Under Spanish rule, the country adopted the denomination Viceroyalty of Peru, which became Republic of Peru after independence.  History =Prehistory and Pre- Columbian Peru= Norte Chico pyramid in the arid Supe Valley The earliest evidences of human presence in Peruvian territory have been dated to approximately 12,500 BCE in the Huaca Prieta settlement. Andean societies were based on agriculture, using techniques such as irrigation and terracing; camelid husbandry and fishing were also important. Organization relied on reciprocity and redistribution because these societies had no notion of market or money. The oldest known complex society in Peru, the Norte Chico civilization, flourished along the coast of the Pacific Ocean between 3,000 and 1,800 BCE. These early developments were followed by archaeological cultures that developed mostly around the coastal and Andean regions throughout Peru. The Cupisnique culture which flourished from around 1000 to 200 BCE along what is now Peru's Pacific Coast was an example of early pre- Incan culture. Moche earrings depicting warriors, made of turquoise and gold (1‚Äì800 CE) The Chav√≠n culture that developed from 1500 to 300 BCE was probably more of a religious than a political phenomenon, with their religious centre in Chav√≠n de Huantar.UNESCO Chavin (Archaeological Site) . Retrieved 27 July 2014 After the decline of the Chavin culture around the beginning of the 1st century CE, a series of localized and specialized cultures rose and fell, both on the coast and in the highlands, during the next thousand years. On the coast, these included the civilizations of the Paracas, Nazca, Wari, and the more outstanding Chimu and Moche. The Moche, who reached their apogee in the first millennium CE, were renowned for their irrigation system which fertilized their arid terrain, their sophisticated ceramic pottery, their lofty buildings, and clever metalwork. The Chimu were the great city builders of pre-Inca civilization; as loose confederation of walled cities scattered along the coast of northern Peru, the Chimu flourished from about 1140 to 1450.Keatinge, Richard W., and Geoffrey W.

The Incas of Cusco originally represented one of the small and relatively minor ethnic groups, the Quechuas. Gradually, as early as the thirteenth century, they began to expand and incorporate their neighbors. Inca expansion was slow until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when the pace of conquest began to accelerate, particularly under the rule of the emperor Pachacuti. Under his rule and that of his son, Topa Inca Yupanqui, the Incas came to control most of the Andean region, with a population of 9 to 16 million inhabitants under their rule. Pachacuti also promulgated a comprehensive code of laws to govern his far-flung empire, while consolidating his absolute temporal and spiritual authority as the God of the Sun who ruled from a magnificently rebuilt Cusco.Peru The Incas From 1438 to 1533, the Incas used a variety of methods, from conquest to peaceful assimilation, to incorporate a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean mountain ranges, from southern Colombia to northern Chile, between the Pacific Ocean in the west and the Amazon rainforest in the east. The official language of the empire was Quechua,Torero Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba, Alfredo.

The Inca referred to their empire as Tawantinsuyu which can be translated as \\"The Four Regions\\" or \\"The Four United Provinces.\\" Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred Huacas, but the Inca leadership encouraged the worship of Inti, the sun god and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama. The Incas considered their King, the Sapa Inca, to be the \\"child of the sun.\\"\\"The Inca\\" at the Wayback Machine (archived 10 November 2009) The National Foreign Language Center at the University of Maryland. 29 May 2007.

In December 1532, a party of conquistadors (supported by the Chankas, Huancas, Ca√±aris and Chachapoyas as Indian auxiliaries) led by Francisco Pizarro defeated and captured the Inca Emperor Atahualpa in the Battle of Cajamarca. The Spanish conquest of Peru was one of the most important campaigns in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory and colonization of the region known as the Viceroyalty of Peru with its capital at Lima, which was then known as \\"La Ciudad de los Reyes\\" (The City of Kings). The conquest of Peru led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba in 1572. Cusco, capital of the Incan Empire The indigenous population dramatically collapsed overwhelmingly due to epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish as well as exploitation and socioeconomic change. Viceroy Francisco de Toledo reorganized the country in the 1570s with gold and silver mining as its main economic activity and Amerindian forced labor as its primary workforce. With the discovery of the great silver and gold lodes at Potos√≠ (present-day Bolivia) and Huancavelica, the viceroyalty flourished as an important provider of mineral resources. Peruvian bullion provided revenue for the Spanish Crown and fueled a complex trade network that extended as far as Europe and the Philippines. Because of lack of available work force, African slaves were added to the labor population. The expansion of a colonial administrative apparatus and bureaucracy paralleled the economic reorganization. With the conquest started the spread of Christianity in South America; most people were forcefully converted to Catholicism, taking only a generation to convert the population. They built churches in every city and replaced some of the Inca temples with churches, such as the Coricancha in the city of Cusco. The church employed the Inquisition, making use of torture to ensure that newly converted Catholics did not stray to other religions or beliefs. Peruvian Catholicism follows the syncretism found in many Latin American countries, in which religious native rituals have been integrated with Christian celebrations.Conquest and Colony of Peru.. Retrieved 28 July 2014 In this endeavor, the church came to play an important role in the acculturation of the natives, drawing them into the cultural orbit of the Spanish settlers.Main fa√ßade of the left By the 18th century, declining silver production and economic diversification greatly diminished royal income. In response, the Crown enacted the Bourbon Reforms, a series of edicts that increased taxes and partitioned the Viceroyalty. The new laws provoked T√∫pac Amaru II's rebellion and other revolts, all of which were suppressed. As a result of these and other changes, the Spaniards and their creole successors came to monopolize control over the land, seizing many of the best lands abandoned by the massive native depopulation. However, the Spanish did not resist the Portuguese expansion of Brazil across the meridian. The Treaty of Tordesillas was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while Spain controlled Portugal. The need to ease communication and trade with Spain led to the split of the viceroyalty and the creation of new viceroyalties of New Granada and Rio de la Plata at the expense of the territories that formed the Viceroyalty of Peru; this reduced the power, prominence and importance of Lima as the viceroyal capital and shifted the lucrative Andean trade to Buenos Aires and Bogot√°, while the fall of the mining and textile production accelerated the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Eventually, the viceroyalty would dissolve, as with much of the Spanish empire, when challenged by national independence movements at the beginning of the nineteenth century. These movements led to the formation of the majority of modern-day countries of South America in the territories that at one point or another had constituted the Viceroyalty of Peru.Peru Peru . Retrieved 27 July 2014. The conquest and colony brought a mix of cultures and ethnicities that did not exist before the Spanish conquered the Peruvian territory. Even though many of the Inca traditions were lost or diluted, new customs, traditions and knowledge were added, creating a rich mixed Peruvian culture. Two of the most important indigenous rebellions against the Spanish were that of Juan Santos Atahualpa in 1742, and Rebellion of T√∫pac Amaru II in 1780 around the highlands near Cuzco. =Independence= The Battle of Ayacucho was decisive in ensuring Peruvian independence. In the early 19th century, while most South American nations were swept by wars of independence, Peru remained a royalist stronghold. As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, independence was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n and Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. The economic crises, the loss of power of Spain in Europe, the war of independence in North America and native uprisings all contributed to a favorable climate to the development of emancipating ideas among the Criollo population in South America. However, the Criollo oligarchy in Peru enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. The liberation movement started in Argentina where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the Spanish government over its colonies. After fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, Jos√© de San Mart√≠n created the Army of the Andes and crossed the Andes in 21 days. Once in Chile he joined forces with Chilean army General Bernardo O'Higgins and liberated the country in the battles of Chacabuco and Maip√∫ in 1818.Scheina, 2003, Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791‚Äì1899, p. 58. On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of Paracas under the command of general Jos√© de San Martin and Thomas Cochrane, who was serving in the Chilean Navy. Immediately on 26 October they took control of the town of Pisco. San Martin settled in Huacho on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north blockading the port of Callao in Lima. At the same time in the north, Guayaquil was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because Peru was the stronghold of the Spanish government in South America, San Martin's strategy to liberate Peru was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the Viceroy that Peru be granted independence, however all negotiations proved unsuccessful. San Mart√≠n proclaiming the independence of Peru. Painting by leftThe Viceroy of Peru, Joaqu√≠n de la Pazuela named Jos√© de la Serna commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion of San Martin. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a coup against de la Pazuela which was recognized by Spain and he was named Viceroy of Peru. This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. In order to avoid a military confrontation San Martin met the newly appointed viceroy, Jos√© de la Serna, and proposed to create a constitutional monarchy, a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city and on 12 July 1821 San Martin occupied Lima and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first Peruvian flag. Alto Peru (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var liberated it three years later. Jos√© de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru. Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a Latin American Confederation floundered and a union with Bolivia proved ephemeral.Gootenberg (1991) p. 12. Simon Bolivar launched his campaign from the north liberating the Viceroyalty of New Granada in the Battles of Carabobo in 1821 and Pichincha a year later. In July 1822 Bolivar and San Martin gathered in the Guayaquil Conference. Bolivar was left in charge of fully liberating Peru while San Martin retired from politics after the first parliament was assembled. The newly founded Peruvian Congress named Bolivar dictator of Peru giving him the power to organize the military. With the help of Antonio Jos√© de Sucre they defeated the larger Spanish army in the Battle of Jun√≠n on 6 August 1824 and the decisive Battle of Ayacucho on 9 December of the same year, consolidating the independence of Peru and Alto Peru. Alto Peru was later established as Bolivia.

Peru embarked on a railroad-building program that helped but also bankrupted the country. In 1879, Peru entered the War of the Pacific which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The Peruvian Government tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on 5 April 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the department of Tarapac√° and the provinces of Tacna and Arica, in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were Francisco Bolognesi and Miguel Grau. Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s. = 20th century = The signing of the 217x217px Internal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the Civilista Party, which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of Augusto B.

Peru: society and nationhood in the Andes. New York: Oxford University Press, pp. 262‚Äì276, . The rivalry between this organization and a coalition of the elite and the military defined Peruvian politics for the following three decades. A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile called the Treaty of Lima, returned Tacna to Peru. Between 1932 and 1933, Peru was engulfed in a year-long war with Colombia over a territorial dispute involving the Amazonas department and its capital Leticia. Later, in 1941, Peru and Ecuador fought the Ecuadorian‚ÄìPeruvian War, after which the Rio Protocol sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, General Manuel A. Odr√≠a became president. Odr√≠a's presidency was known as the Ochenio. Momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a populist course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, civil rights were severely restricted and corruption was rampant throughout his regime. Odr√≠a was succeeded by Manuel Prado Ugarteche. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by Ricardo P√©rez Godoy. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Fernando Bela√∫nde Terry who assumed presidency until 1968. Bela√∫nde was recognized for his commitment to the democratic process. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General Juan Velasco Alvarado, staged a coup against Bela√∫nde. Alvarado's regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support. In 1975, General Francisco Morales-Berm√∫dez forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy. alt= Peru engaged in a brief successful conflict with Ecuador in the Paquisha War as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. After the country experienced chronic inflation, the Peruvian currency, the sol, was replaced by the Inti in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the nuevo sol in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's GDP dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) and MRTA, which caused great havoc throughout the country. Concerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, Alberto Fujimori assumed presidency in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. Faced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the auto-golpe (\\"self-coup\\") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by insurgent groups, most notably the Sendero Luminoso, who carried out terrorist campaigns across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the Barrios Altos massacre and La Cantuta massacre by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of Tarata and Frecuencia Latina by Sendero Luminoso. Those incidents subsequently came to symbolize the human rights violations committed in the last years of violence. During early 1995, once again Peru and Ecuador clashed in the Cenepa War, but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went into a self-imposed exile, avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new Peruvian authorities. = 21st century, Odebrecht Scandal, and political issues= Since the end of the Fujimori regime, Peru has tried to fight corruption while sustaining economic growth.The Economist (17 October 2007), Peru. In spite of human rights progress since the time of insurgency, many problems are still visible and show the continued marginalization of those who suffered through the violence of the Peruvian conflict. A caretaker government presided over by Valent√≠n Paniagua took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections. Afterwards Alejandro Toledo became president in 2001 to 2006. On 28 July 2006, former president Alan Garc√≠a became President of Peru after winning the 2006 elections. In May 2008, Peru became a member of the Union of South American Nations. In April 2009, former president Alberto Fujimori was convicted of human rights violations and sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in killings and kidnappings by the Grupo Colina death squad during his government's battle against leftist guerrillas in the 1990s. On 5 June 2011, Ollanta Humala was elected president. During his presidency, Prime Minister Ana Jara and her cabinet were successfully censured, which was the first time in 50 years that a cabinet had been forced to resign from the Peruvian legislature. In 2016, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski was elected, though his government was short lived as he resigned in 2018 amid various controversies surrounding his administration. Vice president Mart√≠n Vizcarra then assumed office in March 2018 with generally favorable approval ratings. Alan Garc√≠a was involved in the Operation Car Wash scandal and as police tried to arrest him, he committed suicide on 17 April 2019. Later that year, in July, police arrested Alejandro Toledo in California.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru, most Peruvians were under a stay-at-home order. Government and politics Peru is a unitary presidential representative democratic republic with a multi-party system. The country has maintained a liberal democratic system under its 1993 Constitution, which replaced a constitution that leaned the government to a federation to authorize more power to the President. It is also a unitary republic, in which the central government holds the most power and can create administrative divisions. The Peruvian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United States (a written constitution, an autonomous Supreme Court, a presidential system) and the People's Republic of China (a unicameral congress, a premier and ministry system, and a strong executive). The federal government is separated into three branches: * Legislature: the unicameral Congress of Peru, consisting of 130 members of Congress (on a basis of population), the President of Congress, and the Permanent Commission; * Executive: the President, the Council of Ministers, which in practice controls domestic legislation and serve as a Cabinet to the President, consisting of the Prime Minister and 18 ministers of the state; * Judiciary: the Supreme Court of Peru, also known as the Royal Audencia of Lima, composed of 18 justices including a Supreme Justice, along with 28 superior courts, 195 trial courts, and 1,838 district courts.

Their primary mission is to safeguard the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. Their functions are separated by branch: * The Peruvian Army is made up of the Chief of Staff, two Control Bodies, two Support Bodies, five Military Regions and six Command Rooms. * The Peruvian Air Force was officially created on May 20, 1929 with the name of Peruvian Aviation Corps. Its main function is to serve as the country's air defense. It also participates in social support campaigns for hard-to-reach populations, organizes air bridges during disasters, and participates in international peace missions. Its four major air bases are located in the cities of Piura, Callao, Arequipa and Iquitos. *The Peruvian Navy is in charge of the country's maritime, river, and lake defense. It is made up of 26,000 sailors. Personnel are divided into three levels: superior personnel, junior personnel and seafarers. The military is governed by both the Commander in Chief, Ministry of Defense, and Joint Command of the Armed Forces (CCFFAA). The CCFFAA has subordinates to the Operational Commands and Special Commands, with which it carries out the military operations that are required for the defense and the fulfillment of the tasks that the executive power provides.Ministerio de Defensa, Libro Blanco de la Defensa Nacional.

Geography  Peru is located on the central western coast of South America facing the Pacific Ocean. It lies wholly in the Southern Hemisphere, its northernmost extreme reaching to 1.8 minutes of latitude or about 3.3 kilometres (2.1 mi) south of the equator, covers of western South America. It borders Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, Chile to the south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The Andes mountains run parallel to the Pacific Ocean; they define the three regions traditionally used to describe the country geographically. The costa (coast), to the west, is a narrow plain, largely arid except for valleys created by seasonal rivers. The sierra (highlands) is the region of the Andes; it includes the Altiplano plateau as well as the highest peak of the country, the Huascar√°n.Andes Handbook, Huascar√°n . 2 June 2002. The third region is the selva (jungle), a wide expanse of flat terrain covered by the Amazon rainforest that extends east. Almost 60 percent of the country's area is located within this region.Instituto de Estudios Hist√≥rico‚ÄìMar√≠timos del Per√∫, El Per√∫ y sus recursos: Atlas geogr√°fico y econ√≥mico, p. 16. The country has fifty-four hydrographic basins, fifty-two of which are small coastal basins that discharge their waters into the Pacific Ocean. The other two are the Amazon basin, which empties into the Atlantic Ocean, and the endorheic basin of Lake Titicaca, both delimited by the Andes mountain range. In the second of these basins, the giant Amazon River begins, which, with its 6872 km, is the longest river in the world, with 75% of the Peruvian territory. Peru contains 4% of the planet's fresh water. Most Peruvian rivers originate in the peaks of the Andes and drain into one of three basins. Those that drain toward the Pacific Ocean are steep and short, flowing only intermittently. Tributaries of the Amazon River have a much larger flow, and are longer and less steep once they exit the sierra.

Peru has over 1,800 species of birds (120 endemic), and 500 species of mammals and over 300 species of reptiles. The hundreds of mammals include rare species like the puma, jaguar and spectacled bear. The Birds of Peru produce large amounts of guano, an economically important export. The Pacific holds large quantities of sea bass, flounder, anchovies, tuna, crustaceans, and shellfish, and is home to many sharks, sperm whales, and whales. Peru also has an equally diverse flora. The coastal deserts produce little more than cacti, apart from hilly fog oases and river valleys that contain unique plant life. The Highlands above the tree-line known as puna is home to bushes, cactus, drought-resistant plants such as ichu, and the largest species of bromeliad ‚Äì the spectacular Puya raimondii. The cloud-forest slopes of the Andes sustain moss, orchids, and bromeliads, and the Amazon rainforest is known for its variety of trees and canopy plants.

Inflation in 2012 was the lowest in Latin America at only 1.8%, but increased in 2013 as oil and commodity prices rose; it stands at 2.5%. The unemployment rate has fallen steadily and stands at 3.6%. Peruvian economic policy has varied widely over The 1968‚Äì1975 government of Juan Velasco Alvarado introduced radical reforms, which included agrarian reform, the expropriation of foreign companies, the introduction of an economic planning system, and the creation of a large state-owned sector. These measures failed to achieve their objectives of income redistribution and the end of economic dependence on developed nations.Thorp, pp. 318‚Äì319. Despite these results, most reforms were not reversed until the 1990s, when the liberalizing government of Alberto Fujimori ended price controls, protectionism, restrictions on foreign direct investment, and most state ownership of companies. Reforms have permitted sustained economic growth since 1993, except for a slump after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

Demographics =UrbanizationEthnic groups= Peru is a multiethnic nation formed by successive waves of different peoples over five centuries. Amerindians inhabited Peruvian territory for several millennia before the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century; according to historian Noble David Cook, their population decreased from nearly 5‚Äì9 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of infectious diseases.Cook, Noble David (1982) Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520‚Äì1620. Cambridge University Press. p. 114. . The 2017 census for the first time included a question on ethnic self-identification. According to the results, 60.2% of the people identified themselves as Mestizo, 22.3% identified themselves as Quechua, 5.9% identified themselves as White, 3.6% identified themselves as Black, 2.4% identified themselves as Aymara, 2.3% identified themselves as other ethnic groups, and 3.3% didn't declare their ethnicity. Spaniards and Africans arrived in large numbers under colonial rule, mixing widely with each other and with indigenous peoples. After independence, there was gradual immigration from England, France, Germany, and Italy.V√°zquez, Mario (1970) \\"Immigration and mestizaje in nineteenth-century Peru\\", pp. 79‚Äì81 in Race and class in Latin America.

Major cities include the Lima metropolitan area (home to over 9.8 million people), Arequipa, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, Iquitos, Cusco, Chimbote, and Huancayo; all reported more than 250,000 inhabitants in the 2007 census.Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica e Inform√°tica, Perfil sociodemogr√°fico del Per√∫, p. 24. There are 15 uncontacted Amerindian tribes in Peru.\\"Isolated Peru tribe threatened by outsiders. USATODAY.com. 31 January 2012 =Language= Casa de Osambela, headquarters of the Academia Peruana de la Lengua (APL) in Lima According to the Peruvian Constitution of 1993, Peru's official languages are Spanish and, in areas where they predominate, Quechua and other indigenous languages. Spanish is spoken natively by 82.6% of the population, Quechua by 13.9%, and Aymara by 1.7%, while other languages are spoken by the remaining 1.8%. Spanish language is used by the government and is the mainstream language of the country, which is used by the media and in educational systems and commerce. Amerindians who live in the Andean highlands speak Quechua and Aymara and are ethnically distinct from the diverse indigenous groups who live on the eastern side of the Andes and in the tropical lowlands adjacent to the Amazon basin. Peru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a language divide between the coast where Spanish is more predominant over the Amerindian languages, and the more diverse traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional indigenous languages, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the Spanish language. There has been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken. In the Peruvian Amazon, numerous indigenous languages are spoken, including Ash√°ninka, Bora, and Aguaruna. Resonancias.org ‚Äì Aboriginal languages of Peru =Religion= Quri Kancha and the Convent of Santo Domingo, Cuscoalt= Roman Catholicism has been the predominant faith in Peru for centuries, albeit religious practices have a high degree of syncretism with indigenous traditions. As of the 2017 census, 76% of the population over 12 years old described themselves as Catholic, 14.1% as Evangelical, 4.8% as Protestant, Jewish, Latter-day Saints, and Jehovah's Witnesses, and 5.1% as nonreligious. Amerindian religious traditions continue to play a major role in the beliefs of Peruvians. Catholic festivities like Corpus Christi, Holy Week and Christmas sometimes blend with Amerindian traditions. Amerindian festivities from pre-Columbian remain widespread; Inti Raymi, an ancient Inca festival, is still celebrated, especially in rural communities. The majority of towns, cities, and villages have their own official church or cathedral and patron saint. =Education= National University of San Marcos, Lima Peru's literacy rate is estimated at 92.9% as of 2007; this rate is lower in rural areas (80.3%) than in urban areas (96.3%).Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica e Inform√°tica, Perfil sociodemogr√°fico del Per√∫, p. 93. Primary and secondary education are compulsory and free in public schools.Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica del Per√∫, Article No. 17. Peru is home to one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. The National University of San Marcos, founded on 12 May 1551, during the Viceroyalty of Peru, is the first officially established and the oldest continuously functioning university in the Americas. = Health = Peru has a life expectancy of 75.0 years (72.4 for males and 77.7 for females) according to the latest data for the year 2016 from the World Bank.  Toponyms  Many of the Peruvian toponyms have indigenous sources. In the Andes communities of Ancash, Cusco and Puno, Quechua or Aymara names are overwhelmingly predominant. Their Spanish-based orthography, however, is in conflict with the normalized alphabets of these languages. According to Article 20 of Decreto Supremo No 004-2016-MC (Supreme Decree) which approves the Regulations to Law 29735, published in the official newspaper El Peruano on 22 July 2016, adequate spellings of the toponyms in the normalized alphabets of the indigenous languages must progressively be proposed with the aim of standardizing the naming used by the National Geographic Institute (Instituto Geogr√°fico Nacional, IGN). The National Geographic Institute realizes the necessary changes in the official maps of Peru.  Culture  Peruvian culture is primarily rooted in Amerindian traditions, though it has also been influenced by various Asian, African, and European ethnic groups. Peruvian artistic traditions date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of Pre-Inca cultures. The Incas maintained these crafts and made architectural achievements including the construction of Machu Picchu. Baroque dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.Bailey, pp. 72‚Äì74. During this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the Cusco School are representative.Bailey, p. 263. Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of Indigenismo in the early 20th century. Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been eclectic and shaped by both foreign and local art currents. =Visual Arts= Peruvian art has its origin in the Andean civilizations. These civilizations rose in the territory of modern Peru before the arrival of the Spanish. Peruvian art incorporated European elements after the Spanish conquest and continued to evolve throughout the centuries up on to the modern day.  Pre-Columbian art  Moche Nariguera depicting the Decapitator, gold with turquoise and chrysocolla inlays. Museo Oro del Peru, Lima Peru's earliest artwork came from the Cupisnique culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chav√≠n culture, which was largely north of Lima between the Andean mountain ranges of the Cordillera Negra and the Cordillera Blanca. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver and ceramics to create a variety of sculpture and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their architecture and wood sculpture. Between the 9th century BCE and the 2nd century CE, the Paracas Cavernas and Paracas Necropolis cultures developed on the south coast of Peru. Paracas Cavernas produced complex polychrome and monochrome ceramics with religious representations. Burials from the Paracas Necropolis also yielded complex textiles, many produced with sophisticated geometric patterns. The 3rd century BCE saw the flowering of the urban culture, Moche, in the Lambayeque region. The Moche culture produced impressive architectural works, such as the Huacas del Sol y de la Luna and the Huaca Rajada of Sip√°n. They were experts at cultivation in terraces and hydraulic engineering and produced original ceramics, textiles, pictorial and sculptural works. Another urban culture, the Wari civilization, flourished between the 8th and 12th centuries in Ayacucho. Their centralized town planning was extended to other areas, such as Pachacamac, Cajamarquilla and Wari Willka. strings historically used by a number of cultures in the region of Andean South America. Between the 9th and 13th centuries CE, the military urban Tiwanaku empire rose by the borders of Lake Titicaca. Centered around a city of the same name in modern-day Bolivia, the Tiwanaku introduced stone architecture and sculpture of a monumental type. These works of architecture and art were made possible by the Tiwanaku's developing bronze, which enabled them to make the necessary tools. Urban architecture reached a new height between the 14th and 15th centuries in the Chim√∫ Culture. The Chim√∫ built the city of Chan Chan in the valley of the Moche River, in La Libertad. The Chim√∫ were skilled goldsmiths and created remarkable works of hydraulic engineering. The Inca Civilization, which united Peru under its hegemony in the centuries immediately preceding the Spanish conquest, incorporated into their own works a great part of the cultural legacy of the civilizations which preceded it. Important relics of their artwork and architecture can be seen in cities like Cusco, architectural remains like Sacsahuam√°n and Machu Picchu and stone pavements that united Cusco with the rest of the Inca Empire.  Colonial art  Colonial Cusco School painting, 17th‚Äì18th century Peruvian sculpture and painting began to define themselves from the ateliers founded by monks, who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian Baroque School. In this context, the stalls of the Cathedral choir, the fountain of the Main Square of Lima both by Pedro de Noguera, and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the Cuzco School that taught Quechua artists European painting styles. Diego Quispe Tito (1611‚Äì1681) was one of the first members of the Cuzco school and Marcos Zapata (1710‚Äì1773) was one of the last. Painting of this time reflected a synthesis of European and indigenous influences, as is evident in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, by D. de Mora or in the canvases of the Italians Mateo P√©rez de Alesio and Angelino Medoro, the Spaniards Francisco Bejarano and J. de Illescas and the Creole J. Rodriguez. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baroque Style also dominated the field of plastic arts. = Literature = The term Peruvian literature not only refers to literature produced in the independent Republic of Peru, but also to literature produced in the Viceroyalty of Peru during the country's colonial period, and to oral artistic forms created by diverse ethnic groups that existed in the area during the prehispanic period, such as the Quechua, the Aymara and the Chanka people. Peruvian literature is rooted in the oral traditions of pre-Columbian civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included chronicles and religious literature. After independence, Costumbrism and Romanticism became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of Ricardo Palma.Martin, \\"Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820‚Äì1870\\", pp. 37‚Äì39. The early 20th century's Indigenismo movement was led by such writers as Ciro Alegr√≠aMartin, \\"Narrative since c. 1920\\", pp. 151‚Äì152. and Jos√© Mar√≠a Arguedas.Martin, \\"Narrative since c. 1920\\", pp. 178‚Äì179. C√©sar Vallejo wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse. Modern Peruvian literature is recognized thanks to authors such as Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, a leading member of the Latin American Boom.Martin, \\"Narrative since c. 1920\\", pp. 186‚Äì188.Ceviche is a popular lime marinated seafood dish which originated in Peru. = Cuisine = Due to the Spanish expedition and discovery of the Americas, the explorers started the Columbian Exchange which included food unheard of in the Old World, such as potato, tomato, and maize. Modern indigenous Peruvian food mainly consists of corn, potatoes, and chilies. There are now more than 3,000 kinds of potatoes grown on Peruvian terrain, according to Peru's Instituto Peruano de la Papa. Modern Peruvian cuisine blends Amerindian and Spanish food with strong influences from Chinese, African, Arab, Italian, and Japanese cooking.Custer, pp. 17‚Äì22. Common dishes include anticuchos, ceviche, and pachamanca. Peru's varied climate allows the growth of diverse plants and animals good for cooking.Custer, pp. 25‚Äì38. Peru's diversity of ingredients and cooking techniques is receiving worldwide acclaim.Embassy of Peru in the United States, The Peruvian Gastronomy.peruvianembassy.us. Peruvian cuisine reflects local practices and ingredients‚Äîincluding influences from the indigenous population including the Inca and cuisines brought in with colonizers and immigrants. Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are corn, potatoes and other tubers, Amaranthaceaes (quinoa, ka√±iwa and kiwicha) and legumes (beans and lupins). Staples brought by the Spanish include rice, wheat and meats (beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods‚Äîsuch as quinoa, kiwicha, chili peppers, and several roots and tubers have increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. It is also common to see traditional cuisines being served with a modern flair in towns like Cusco, where tourists come to visit. Chef Gaston Acurio has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients. = Music = Marinera Norte√±a Peruvian music has Andean, Spanish, and African roots.Romero, Ra√∫l (1999). \\"Andean Peru\\". In: John Schechter (ed.), Music in Latin American culture: regional tradition. New York: Schirmer Books, pp. 385‚Äì386. In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely in each region; the quena and the tinya were two common instruments. Spaniards introduced new instruments, such as the guitar and the harp, which led to the development of crossbred instruments like the charango. African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the caj√≥n, a percussion instrument. Peruvian folk dances include marinera, tondero, zamacueca, diablada and huayno.Romero, Ra√∫l (1985). \\"La m√∫sica tradicional y popular\\". In: Patronato Popular y Porvenir, La m√∫sica en el Per√∫. Lima: Industrial Gr√°fica, pp. pp. 243‚Äì245, 261‚Äì265. Peruvian music is dominated by the national instrument, the charango. The charango is member of the lute family of instruments and was invented during colonial times by musicians imitating the Spanish vihuela. In the Canas and Titicaca regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking mermaids with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the Indigenismo movement (1910‚Äì1940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the walaycho, chillador, chinlili, and the larger and lower-tuned charangon. While the Spanish guitar is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin bandurria. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere four courses. Violins and harps, also of European origin, are also played. = Cinema = While the Peruvian film industry has not been nearly as prolific as that of some other Latin American countries, some Peruvian movies produced enjoyed regional success. Historically, the cinema of Peru began in Iquitos in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo (with a momentous, initial film billboard from 1900) because the rubber boom and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima. Peru also produced the first animated 3-D film in Latin America, Piratas en el Callao. This film is set in the historical port city of Callao, which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the Peruvian company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: Dragones: Destino de Fuego. In February 2006, the film Madeinusa, produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by Claudia Llosa, was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by Magaly Solier and the traumas of post-civil war Peru. Llosa, who shared elements of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez's magic realism, won an award at the Rotterdam Film Festival. Llosa's second feature, The Milk of Sorrow (\\"La Teta Asustada\\"), was nominated for the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Picture, the first Peruvian film in the Academy's history to be nominated. The Milk of Sorrow (\\"La Teta Asustada\\"), won the Golden Bear award at the 2009 Berlinale.

Ingredients The following is a partial list of ingredients used in Creole cuisine and some of the staple ingredients. =Grains= *Corn *Rice ‚Äî long, medium, or short grain white; also popcorn rice :Rice proved to be a valuable commodity in Creole cuisine. With an abundance of water and a hot, humid climate, rice could be grown practically anywhere in the region and grew wild in some areas. Rice became the predominant starch in the diet, as it was easy to grow, store and prepare. The oldest rice mill in operation in the United States, the Conrad Rice Mill, is located in New Iberia. *Wheat (for baking bread) =Fruits and vegetables= *Bell peppers *Blackberries *Cayenne peppers *Celery *Collard greens *Cucumbers *Figs *Limes *Lemons *Mirlitons (also called chayotes or vegetable pears) *Muscadines *Okra *Onions *Pecans *Satsuma oranges *Scallions (also known as green onions or onion tops) *Squash *Strawberries *Sweet potatoes *Tabasco pepper *Tomatoes =Meat and seafood= Creole folkways include many techniques for preserving meat, some of which are waning due to the availability of refrigeration and mass-produced meat at the grocer. Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or duck confit (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities. Game is still uniformly popular in Creole cooking. The recent increase of catfish farming in the Mississippi Delta has increased its usage in Creole cuisine, replacing the more traditional wild- caught trout (the saltwater species) and red fish. Seafood *Freshwater **Bass (Commonly known as green trout in south Louisiana) **Catfish **Sac-au-Lait (white perch or crappie) **Yellow perch *Saltwater or brackish water species **Trout **Redfish **Pompano **Drumfish **Flounder **Grouper **Perch - many varieties **Snapper - many varieties *Shellfish **Crawfish (ecrevisse)- either wild swamp or farm-raised **Shrimp, or Crevette (\\"Chevrette\\" in Colonial Louisiana French) **Oysters **Blue Crab Also included in the seafood mix are some so-called trash fish that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods. These were brought home by fishermen to feed the family. Examples are garfish, black drum also called gaspergou or just \\"goo\\", croaker, and bream. Poultry *Farm Raised **Turkey (and turkey confit) **Chicken (and Guinea Hen) *Game birds **Dove **Goose **Quail **Duck (and duck confit) Pork *Andouille - a spicy dry smoked sausage, characterized by a coarse-ground texture *Chaurice, similar to the Spanish chorizo *Ham hocks *Wild boar or feral hog *Head cheese *Pork sausage (fresh) - not smoked or cured, but highly seasoned. Mostly used in gumbos. The sausage itself does not include rice, separating it from boudin. *Salt Pork Beef and dairy Though parts of the Louisiana where Creole cooking is found are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Creole form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the southern US, although seasoned differently. Dairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are unique dairy items produced in Creole cooking such as Creole cream cheese. Other game meats *Alligator *Alligator gar, or Gator gar *Frog, usually Bullfrogs (not just the legs, but the entire creature) *Gros bec commonly called Night heron *Nutria *Squirrel *Rabbit *Skunk, or mouffette *Turtle *Snake *Virginia opossum, or sarigue =Creole seasonings= Individual *Bay leaf *Oregano *Bell peppers (green or red) *Black pepper *Cayenne pepper *Celery *Garlic *Onion (bell pepper, onion, and celery used together are known as the \\"holy trinity\\" of Creole cuisine.) *Parsley, flat leaf *Sassafras leaves (dried and ground into the spice known as fil√© for gumbo of the Choctaw) *Dried shrimp *Sugarcane, also cane syrup, brown sugar and molasses *Thyme Blended *\\"Creole spice\\" blends such as Tony Chachere's and REX King of Spice are sometimes used in Creole kitchens, but do not suit every cook's style because Creole-style seasoning is often achieved from scratch, even by taste. Whole peppers are almost never used in authentic Creole dishes ‚Äî ground Cayenne, paprika, and pepper sauces predominate. *Hot sauce *Seafood boil mix *Vinegar seasoned with small, pickled, hot green peppers is a common condiment with many Creole meals. *Persillade *Marinades made with olive oil, brown sugar, and citrus juices *Various barbecue rubs similar to those in other states Cooking bases Knowing how to make a good roux is key to Cajun and Creole cooking. The technique was inherited from the French. A roux is \\"a mixture made from equal parts of fat and flour, used especially to make a sauce or soup thicker.\\" The fat and flour are cooked together on the stovetop until the mixture reaches a certain level of brownness, or darkness. Creole roux in New Orleans are known to be lighter than Cajun roux and are usually made with butter or bacon fat and flour. But certain Creole dishes use a dark roux. Dark roux are usually made with oil or bacon fat and flour. The scent of a good roux is so strong that it stays in clothes until they are washed. The scent is so widely recognized in Louisiana that others can tell if someone is making a roux, and often infer that they're making a gumbo. The secret to making a good gumbo is pairing the roux with the protein, similar to pairing the right wine and protein. *Light roux: A light roux is well-suited for seafood dishes, because the roux will not overwhelm the subtle seafood flavors. A light-colored roux does not support the heavier meat flavor of meat-based gumbos. For a light roux, the flour is cooked to a light golden brown. *Medium roux: Medium roux are the most versatile and probably the most common among the Creole cuisine of the New Orleans area. They work well with most Creole dishes. A medium roux will turn the color of a copper penny or peanut butter. A medium roux begins to take on the warm, browned flavor widely associated with gumbo. *Dark roux: A dark roux, with its strong (dense) nutty flavor will completely overpower a simple seafood gumbo, but is the perfect complement to a gumbo using chicken, sausage, crawfish or alligator. Chicken will just settle into the darker flavor, while sausage and dark roux balance each other well. A dark roux is approximately the color of milk chocolate. Preparing a dark roux is complicated. It involves heating oil or fat and flour very carefully, constantly stirring for 15‚Äì45 minutes (depending on the darkness desired), until the mixture has turned quite dark and developed a rich, nutty flavor and smell. It's very easy to burn the flour as it moves toward a darker brown, and burnt roux renders a dish unpalatable. A heavy-bottomed pot can help protect the roux from burning. *Stocks: Creole stocks may be more heavily seasoned than Continental counterparts, and the shellfish stock sometimes made with shrimp and crawfish heads is unique to Creole cuisine. **Fish stock and Court-bouillon **Shellfish stock **Chicken stock Creole dishes=Primary favorites= Seafood gumbo Gumbo - Gumbo is the quintessential stew-like soup of Louisiana. The dish is a Louisiana version of West African okra soups which the dish gumbo is named for. The name \\"gumbo\\" is derived from the French term for okra, which entered Louisiana French from West African languages as \\"gombo\\", from the West African \\"kilogombo\\" or \\"quingombo\\". Okra, often one of the principal ingredients in gumbo recipes, is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct flavor. In modern Louisiana cuisine, okra is not a requirement any longer, so gumbos can be made either with or without okra. Often gumbo that is not made with okra is made with a Louisiana spice called fil√©, a spice made from ground sassafras leaves. Chicken gumbos are often made without okra and made with fil√© instead. Tradition holds that a seafood gumbo is more common in summer months when okra is plentiful and a chicken or wild game gumbo in winter months when hunting is common. However, in modern times a variety of gumbo types have become commonplace year-round in Louisiana. A fil√© gumbo is thickened with dried sassafras leaves after the stew has finished cooking, a practice borrowed from the Choctaw Indians. The backbone of a gumbo is roux of which there are two variations mainly used. A medium roux, or a dark roux, which is made of flour, toasted in fat or oil until well-browned. Jambalaya - The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains rice, some sort of meat (such as chicken or beef) or seafood (such as shrimp or crawfish) and almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery, tomatoes and hot chili peppers. Anything else is optional. Jambalaya is a dish of Spanish origin in Louisiana from the time when Spaniards were attempting to make their beloved dish \\"paella\\" in the new world. The dish has later evolved, going through a creolization of Louisiana influences. Jambalaya is a highly seasoned rice casserole. Shrimp Creole - Shrimp Creole is a favorite of Creole cuisine in the greater New Orleans area. It's a dish made of shrimp, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, celery, garlic and cayenne pepper. Classic shrimp creole does not contain a roux, but some cooks may add one. It's an early Creole dish that shows its strong French and Spanish heritage. Red Beans and Rice - Red beans and rice is one of the most common dishes found in New Orleans, cooked in homes and restaurants throughout the New Orleans area. Red beans arrived with white French Creoles from Haiti who escaped Haiti during the slave uprising, settling in New Orleans. The wonderful stew of red beans has a strong Caribbean influence. Rice and gravy - Rice and gravy dishes are a staple of Creole cuisine and is usually a brown gravy based on pan drippings, which are deglazed and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice. The dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a cast iron pot, typically for an extended time period in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender. Beef, pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation. Popular local varieties include hamburger steak, smothered rabbit, turkey necks, and chicken fricassee. = Primary desserts = Bread Pudding - A dessert made from day- old or stale French bread. A popular Creole and Cajun dessert that also contains eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla. =Food as an event=Crawfish boil Louisiana-style crawfish boil The crawfish boil is a celebratory event that involves boiling crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn in large pots over propane cookers. The crawfish boil is an event central to both Creole and Cajun cuisines. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper and other spices, commonly known as \\"crab boil\\" or \\"crawfish boil\\" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in Creole spice blends, such as REX, Zatarain's, Louisiana Fish Fry or Tony Chachere's. Also, Cocktail sauce, mayonnaise and hot sauce are sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner. Attendees are encouraged to \\"suck the head\\" of a crawfish by separating the abdomen of the crustacean and sucking out the abdominal fat/juices. Often, newcomers to the crawfish boil, or those unfamiliar with the traditions, are jokingly warned \\"not to eat the dead ones\\". This comes from the common belief that when live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves, but when dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp. Seafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.
