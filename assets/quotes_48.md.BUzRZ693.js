The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1921; it is a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. The King's Somborne memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all sharing a broadly similar design; another, Stockbridge War Memorial, is situated in the nearby town of Stockbridge. Prior to the outbreak of war, Lutyens established his reputation designing luxurious country houses for wealthy clients. Like many of his war memorials, the commission for King's Somborne originated with a pre-war client. Lutyens designed Marshcourt, a country house near Stockbridge, for Herbert Johnson at the turn of the twentieth century; during the First World War, Johnson and his wife Violet ran a 60-bed military hospital out of Marshcourt and after the Armistice, Johnson was adamant that King's Somborne and Stockbridge should both have a memorial to the war dead. Inception It was Johnson, with the assistance of the local vicar, who chaired the first public meeting in King's Somborne to discuss the village's commemorations, held in the village schoolhouse in February 1919. Several letters containing ideas for the form of the memorial were read out, and several more were proposed during the meeting, including a wayside cross and a parish hall.Skelton, pp. 80‚Äì81. The meeting agreed to hold a consultation to establish how much the residents of the village would be willing to contribute, and to form a large committee to decide on the form; Johnson pledged a donation of ¬£100. When the committee reported back, its decision was to commission a Lutyens War Cross, along with a bronze tablet in the nearby Church of St Peter and St Paul to bear the names of the dead. History and design The cross stands at the junction of Romsey Road (the A3057 road) and Church Road in the centre of King's Somborne. It is in Portland stone, consisting of a tapering, lozenge-shaped shaft with short arms moulded close to the top. It sits on a three-tiered plinth of stone blocks which itself sits on a narrow coved plinth which splays upwards from the bottom to provide a seat at the foot of the cross. The plinth rests on base of three shallow stone steps. On the front of the plinth is the inscription: \\"TO THE GLORIOUS MEMORY OF THE MEN OF KINGS SOMBORNE / MCM XIV + MCM XIX / MCM XXXIX + MCM XLV\\" and on the back: \\"THANKS BE TO GOD WHO GIVETH US THE VICTORY\\". The names of the fallen from both world wars are inscribed below the dedication around the plinth; the inscriptions related to the Second World War were added at a later date.Skelton, p. 170. The memorial was unveiled by Rear Admiral Sir Godfrey Paine on 27 March (Easter Sunday) 1921. The Portland stone memorial, being a limestone, gradually weathered to the point that the legibility of the names was affected. In the late 20th century, the names were re-cut and filled with black paint to preserve their legibility.Skelton, p. 154. After Violet Johnson's death in 1923, Lutyens designed a memorial cross to her, which was placed in Winton Hill Cemetery in Stockbridge, and which is today a grade II listed building. King's Somborne War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 7 February 1986. In November 2015, as part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free-standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

The church opened in 1867 and now forms part of the Beaminster Area Team Ministry. History St Mary's was built as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St John the Baptist in Broadwindsor. Owing to the church's two mile distance from the village, Rev. Solomon Caesar Malan had expressed his wish for a chapel of ease to serve Drimpton and its surrounding hamlets since he became vicar of the parish in 1845. The vicar raised the necessary funds by public subscription, which mostly came from local residents and friends of the vicar. One donor was Richard Chenevix Trench, the Archbishop of Dublin. The local landowner Captain Spurwey of Catherstone, Charmouth gifted the stone required to construct the church from a quarry on his estate, which was hauled to the site by local farmers. The plans for the church were drawn up by James Mountford Allen of Crewkerne and Mr. Holt of Broadwindsor hired as the builder. Construction began in 1863 but its completion was delayed when the builder began started working to his own plans in favour of Allen's and without the knowledge or consent of Rev. Malan. The contract was handed over to Mr. John Chick of Beaminster and the existing work that did not match Allen's original design was removed and redone. St Mary's was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury, Rt. Rev. Walter Kerr Hamilton, on 21 July 1867. Public admission was by ticket to avoid overcrowding and the Bishop later travelled to the parish church at Broadwindsor to preach during an afternoon service. The evening service at St Mary's was described by the Dorset County Chronicle as \\"crammed to suffocation\\". 27 infants and older children were put forward for baptising, however only 16 could be achieved during the service's duration. Architecture St Mary's is built of local stone, with dressings in Ham stone, sourced from the quarries of Mr. John Trask of Norton-sub-Hamdon, in the Early English style. The windows and door head was constructed with overhead arches of red stone from Bishops Lydeard. Designed to accommodate up to 90 persons, the church is made up of a nave and chancel. It was built with four single-light lancet-headed windows on each side, a three-light window at the east end and a small window of three trefoils above the entrance. The north and south sides of the church are strengthened with buttresses, while the west end gable contains a bellcote of Ham stone with one bell and surmounted by a wrought iron cross. The church's porch was added in the mid-20th century. The internal fittings, including the open-timbered roof, pulpit, reading desk and benches, were made of stained and varnished Dantzic fir. After World War I, a wooden war memorial was attached to the church wall in remembrance to the seven local men who lost their lives in the conflict.

He helped set up the organisation Holy Fools. Early life and education His father was Kenneth Bruce Findlater Bain, a theatre critic who wrote under the name Richard Findlater. His mother was Romany Bain, a freelance journalist. He was one of triplets. He attended St. Paul's School in West London, then read theology at Bristol University and Cuddesdon Theological College. He was ordained an Anglican priest in 1978. In 1990 he spent a year at Fooltime (now Circomedia), a circus training college in Bristol, and became a professional clown. He served in parallel as an associate vicar at St Mary the Virgin Church in Olveston. Career After serving as a parish priest, Bain decided to convey the Christian message through a different route, inspired by his lifelong love of clowns. His father had written a biography of the famous clown Joseph Grimaldi. As a young boy, Bain had loved the sad-faced clown Coco. So he took a clown's training and became a freelance clown-priest, presenting the Gospel message through jokes and pratfalls. He performed in churches, conference halls, hospitals, schools, football fields, and prisons. He would enter the venue on a unicycle, open with the invocation \\"Let us play!\\", and preach while balancing on (or falling from) a slackrope, a speciality of Bain. Like Coco, Bain performed as an Auguste, a clumsy character who is on the receiving end of water buckets and accidents, and who often works as a foil to the more clever and arrogant stage personality of the white-faced clown. According to Bain, the Auguste role allowed him to provide a mirror to everyday personalities, if it was not too exaggerated. He often took on the stock character roles of the Jester and the Vulnerable Lover. He performed routines like juggling and egg-smashing and blew soap bubbles. According to his website, he had custard-pied ten bishops, and \\"most were grateful ‚Äì or at least happy to play\\". Bain traced the origins of his clown ministry to the \\"holy fools\\" and \\"feasts of fools\\" of the Middle Ages, and quoted Saint Paul saying \\"We are fools for Christ.\\" (1 Corinthians 4:10) He was the only Church of England priest to work full-time as a clown. He once said, ‚ÄúThat is the only sort of clowning I do: getting across the Christian message to different audiences in different ways.‚Äù He took his act to Europe, America, and Australia. He was partially supported by a non-profit organisation called The Faith and Foolishness Trust, which supports clown- priests. In 1982 he helped to set up Holy Fools, an organisation to support clown ministry. He was a member of both the College of Evangelists and Clowns International; at Clowns International he served as chaplain. He wrote several books: Fools Rush In (1993), Clowning Glory (1995, with Patrick Forbes), and Playing the Fool (2001), a memoir. In 1994 he was named Clown of the Year by Clowns International, and in 1999 he received Clowns International's Slapstick prize.  Mentions in academic publications  A 1996 German monograph by Angelika Richter and Lori Zonner in the Journal of Religion and Health, described by Marc Abrahams in his book This Is Improbable, called Bain the most prominent spiritual clown in England. The \\"Clown\\" entry in the Encyclopedia of Christian Education mentions Bain, adding that clown ministry is \\"an authentic way of doing theology\\" which offers unique insights into the nature of God and humanity, and as such has been accepted by mainline denominations. Sandra Billington's 2015 book A Social History of the Fool describes the inspirational aspects of the clownerie and its spread of \\"a kind of mental oxygen\\". She draws parallels between Bain celebrating the Christian court jester (for example, in his 2001 book) and similar publications such as 1999's The Corporate Fool, which advocates \\"creative folly\\" in the workplace.

She graduated from nursing school in 1897 and after touring Europe and studying hospitals there, was appointed as the first commoner to direct the Japanese Red Cross. In 1920, she led a successful campaign to assist Polish orphans who had become refugees in Siberia and that same year was one of the inaugural recipients of the Florence Nightingale Medal. She served as an honorary delegate to the International Council of Nurses (ICN) for 22 years before she was able to found the Nursing Association of the Japanese Empire in 1929 and gain full admission to the ICN in 1933. She was the Superintendent of Nursing for the Japanese Red Cross for 36 years. Early life Take Hagiwara was born on 7 February 1873 in Itsukaichi village of the Nishitama District in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Her parents were Chiyo and Hee Saemon Hagiwara and she was the eldest child and only girl, with five younger brothers. During the Edo period, the family had been coal wholesalers, but by the time Hagiwara was born, her father operated a straw house, bringing straw from rice farmers to sell. The family had little income and the mother took in work to help make ends meet. When she was around five years old, Hagiwara enrolled in the Susumuno School and though her marks were high, had to quit after three years to care for her siblings. She studied on her own for a time, reading in between tending her brothers, and then around 1885 started helping in the Kojima Clinic and became fascinated with medicine. From about age fifteen, Hagiwara began a correspondence course and studied arithmetic, chemistry, geography, history, Japanese calligraphy, Japanese poetry and physics. She completed all the requirements for the women's communication undergraduate degree being offered through the ' () and received a diploma in January 1891. She went to the capital and began studying at the Sakurai Midwife School, but had to leave due to financial concerns after a year. In the fall of 1892, the Japanese Red Cross began looking for nursing recruits and the following spring Hagiwara entered the JRC nurses' training program, as they did not charge for expenses or classes. Career In 1894 the decision was made by the Red Cross to send nurses in the midst of their training to help with relief efforts when the Sino Japanese War broke out. Hagiwara was sent and received praise for her service; she was specifically requested to help with relief efforts in Aomori, Iwate, and Miyagi Prefectures when the 1896 Tsunami caused civil disasters in those areas. She graduated in 1897 from the Red Cross Nursing program and began working in relief efforts of various military campaigns. Hagiwara was awarded the Seventh Order of the Precious Crown for her service during the First Sino-Japanese War and later was awarded the Officier d‚ÄôAcademie from the French government for her service during the Boxer Rebellion in China. Hagiwara had worked her way up the ranks to secondary lead nurse by the time she was sent to help during the Russo-Japanese War. In 1907, she became the honorary Japanese Associate National Member to the International Council of Nurses (ICN), as a nursing sister delegate for the Japanese Red Cross Society. That same year, Hagiwara was requested to become part of the royal entourage and traveled throughout Europe as an attendant, visiting hospitals along the way. She first accompanied the Marchioness Yamanouchi; then by 1909 was serving the Prince and Princess Nashimoto in Paris and had been selected as Chief Nurse of the Red Cross Nurses‚Äô Union. In 1909, Hagiwara attended the London Congress of the ICN and her paper for the conference was presented by Lavinia Dock, because Hagiwara did not speak English. After the congress, Hagiwara tried to meet Florence Nightingale, but the British nurse was very ill. Upon Nightingale's death the following year, Hagiwara held a memorial ceremony with nurses, executives and staff of the Japanese Red Cross, and dignitaries, officiated by a Shinto priest in Nightingale's honor. Hagiwara returned from traveling abroad and was appointed as the assistant inspector of nurses and student-nurses at the Central Hospital. In 1910, she was made Nursing Superintendent of the JRC Nurses, and was the first non-royal person to hold the post. She attended the 1912 ICN Congress in Cologne presenting another paper and then spoke at the banquet which created an educational foundation in the name of Nightingale. After her father's death in 1917, Hagiwara moved her mother and brother Mokichi to ≈åmori, to be nearer to her work at the Red Cross. In 1919, Hagiwara and the JRC assisted the Imperial Japanese Army in the Siberian Intervention during the Russian Revolution. Preceding the Russian Revolution, Poles, who had been exiled to Siberia or sought refuge there during World War I, numbered around 20 million people. During the intervention, the problem of Polish orphans became evident to Hagiwara. AnnƒÖ Bielkiewicz and J√≥zefem Jak√≥bkiewiczem, of Vladivostok had formed the Polish Rescue Committee, began collecting orphans from throughout the area and petitioned Western countries for help. When they were unsuccessful in the West, Bielkiewicz and Jak√≥bkiewiczem sent petitions to Japan and the Polish American community. On behalf of the JRC, Hagiwara requested that the Japanese Government assist with orphan relief work and obtained government approval within seventeen days. In 1920, Hagiwara, along with Yao Yamamoto () and Ume Yuasa () were awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in its inaugural presentation for their nursing excellence. Between July 1920 and July 1921, 375 Polish orphans were transported to Japan and to the care of the JRC nurses in Tokyo. The children suffered from typhoid and other diseases and one nurse, Fumi Matsuzawa, succumbed to infection from the children and died. After providing them with health services, as well as shoes and clothing, the JRC helped transport the children to Yokohama, where they were sent to Polish Relief Organizations in Seattle, Washington. Hagiwara went to the docks to speak to each child as they boarded the ship. A second transport of 390 children, then arrived in July, 1922, with the children sent to Osaka. As before, the children were restored to health by the JRC and given clothing and footwear, but this group were returned to Poland. Hagiwara attended the 1929 Congress of the ICN held in Montreal and that same year finally was able to found the Nursing Association of the Japanese Empire. She was unanimously elected as president of the association. At the Paris Congress of the ICN held in 1933, Hagiwara saw a dream come true when the Nursing Association of the Japanese Empire was admitted as a full member to the Council. Though her chronic asthma was worsening with age, Hagiwara continued to be active both in and out of the country until her death. Death and legacy Hagiwara died on 27 May 1936 in Tokyo and was buried on 30 May 1936 with a large funeral hosted by the Japanese Red Cross. Her tomb is located in Akiruno-shi at the Owada Kotokuji Temple. In front of the branch office of the Akiruno City Hall in Itsukaichi is a bust of Hagiwara bearing the inscription \\"Take Hagiwara humanitarian of the nation\\" (). She has been referred to in the press as \\"Japan's Florence Nightingale\\" or the \\"Japanese Nightingale\\".

The film stars Michael St. Michaels, Sky Elobar, Elizabeth De Razzo, Gil Gex, Abdoulaye NGom and Holland MacFallister. The film was released on October 7, 2016 by FilmRise. Plot Big Ronnie runs a disco-themed walking location tour in his town, alongside his son Big Brayden. Ronnie allows Brayden to live with him on the condition that Brayden prepares excessively greasy food for him. Ronnie is a pathological liar who fabricates stories about disco groups like the Bee Gees. Brayden aspires to be a space fantasy author. Ronnie asserts that Brayden drove his mother away, though Brayden says that she left Ronnie for a man named Ricky Prickles. At night, Ronnie completely covers himself in grease and strangles residents of the town, becoming known as \\"The Greasy Strangler.\\" After his killings, he cleans himself of the grease by standing in a car wash run by a blind man named Big Paul. During one of the disco walking tours, Brayden meets a woman named Janet, and the two begin a romantic relationship. One night, Ronnie strangles a hot dog vendor he had gotten in an argument with earlier, causing his eyes to pop out of his head, which Ronnie cooks and eats. He later kills Oinker, Brayden's best friend. Brayden and Janet have sex, and the next morning, Ronnie attempts to seduce her. Ronnie takes Janet out to a discotheque, threatening to evict Brayden if he does not allow them to. There, Ronnie attempts to kiss Janet, but she resists, saying that she may be in love with Brayden. Ronnie later has sex with Janet, and leading to a heated argument between him and Brayden. Ronnie and Janet continue a physical relationship, mocking Brayden when he confronts them in despair. One night, Brayden professes his love to Janet. Ronnie overhears this before going to the car wash to strangle and decapitate Paul. The next morning, Brayden calls a detective named Jody and reports that Ronnie may be the Greasy Strangler. Jody - who is actually Ronnie in disguise - comes to the house the next day, and Brayden and Janet show him a spot of oil left behind on the carpet as evidence that Ronnie is the Greasy Strangler. Jody concludes that the oil is meaningless circumstantial evidence, and demands that they end all inquiries about Ronnie having committed the murders. That night, Janet declares her mutual love for Brayden, and they decide to get married. Ronnie, hiding under the bed, reveals himself, claiming Janet as his lover and evicting Brayden. Janet replies that Brayden can stay at her residence, and Ronnie covers himself in grease, slaps Brayden, and drags Janet out of the house with him. Brayden covers himself in grease as well, and follows Ronnie and Janet to a movie theatre, where Ronnie is strangling her. Brayden strangles Janet instead, causing her eyes to pop out of her head, which both he and Ronnie consume. The next day, on a beach, Ronnie reveals that he cares for Brayden, despite his annoyance with him. They bond over, in hindsight, their disgust with Janet. They cover themselves in grease and head to a forest where they murder Ricky Prickles. They then witness themselves being executed by firing squad, watching as confetti and champagne explode from their heads. They venture deeper into the forest, still covered in grease, and primally shake wooden spears at the camera.

Nimrod expedition Marston was friends with two of Shackleton's sisters, and it was them that encouraged Martson to apply to join their brother's expedition to Antarctica aboard the Nimrod. During the Nimrod expedition, George helped to print the book Aurora Australis whilst stationed on Antarctica during the winter, contributing sketching and lithographs. Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition George was one of the first members to sign up for this expedition, and one of the few to have worked alongside Shackleton before. Marston tended to be somewhat of a procrasinator when needed for necessary duties during the expedition, though he was liked for the most part by the crew. He would often yearn for his wife and children back home, which caused him to be rather moody. Because of these things, over the course of the journey Shackleton grew to dislike Marston.Lansing. pp. 50-51 While marooned on Elephant Island, some of Marston's oil paints were used to caulk the boat used by Shackleton to reach South Georgia.

That is, as topological spaces, graphs are exactly the simplicial 1-complexes and also exactly the one-dimensional CW complexes. Thus, in particular, it bears the quotient topology of the set :X_0 \\\\sqcup \\\\bigsqcup_{e \\\\in E} I_e under the quotient map used for gluing. Here X_0 is the 0-skeleton (consisting of one point for each vertex x \\\\in V), I_e are the intervals (\\"closed one-dimensional unit balls\\") glued to it, one for each edge e \\\\in E, and \\\\sqcup is the disjoint union. The topology on this space is called the graph topology.  Subgraphs and -trees  A subgraph of a graph X is a subspace Y \\\\subseteq X which is also a graph and whose nodes are all contained in the 0-skeleton of X. Y is a subgraph if and only if it consists of vertices and edges from X and is closed. A subgraph T \\\\subseteq X is called a tree iff it is contractible as a topological space.  Properties  * Every connected graph X contains at least one maximal tree T \\\\subseteq X, that is, a tree that is maximal with respect to the order induced by set inclusion on the subgraphs of X which are trees. * If X is a graph and T \\\\subseteq X a maximal tree, then the fundamental group \\\\pi_1(X) equals the free group generated by elements (f_\\\\alpha)_{\\\\alpha \\\\in A}, where the \\\\\\\\{f_\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} correspond bijectively to the edges of X \\\\setminus T; in fact, X is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of circles. * Forming the topological space associated to a graph as above amounts to a functor from the category of graphs to the category of topological spaces. * The associated topological space of a graph is connected (with respect to the graph topology) if and only if the original graph is connected. * Every covering space projecting to a graph is also a graph.

It was formerly a sub-district in Bilad al-Sham during the 7th‚Äì11th centuries CE. Geography In modern-day Jordan, the region of Al-Sharat starts immediately south of Wadi Mujib. The northern range contains mountains with peaks up to 1,200 meters above sea level, while to the south the mountains get as high as above sea level. The principal city of Bilad al-Sharat is Al-Karak. The northern part of the region in Jordan is under the administration of the Karak Governorate, while the more arid part south of Wadi Arabah comes under the Ma'an Governorate. In the 9th century, Al-Sharat's capital was Adhruh, but by the late 10th century, it apparently was replaced by Sughar (Zoar). Other principal towns in the district included Tabuk, Ma'an (Mu'an), Madyan, Aynunah (on the northern Red Sea coast), Wayla (Ayla) and Maab (Rabba). History From the beginning of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, Al-Sharat formed the southern kurah (district) of Jund Dimashq (Province of Damascus), until the late 9th century, after which it became part of Jund Filastin (Province of Palestine). It was the Tulunids who first attached Al-Sharat to Filastin for practical purposes, as the district was closer to Filastin than Damascus. In 985, during the late Abbasid period, the Jerusalemite geographer Al-Muqaddasi described Al-Sharat as its own district, neither belonging to Dimashq nor Filastin, in the larger province of Ash-Shaam (The 'Syria' or 'Levant'). The district of Al-Sharat corresponded with the mountains of Moab. Persian geographer Al-Istakhri (d. 957) described the district as \\"extremely fertile and rich\\" and dominated by marauding Bedouin tribes. In the late 10th century, the old-established Yamani tribes of Lakhm and Judham were engaged in a struggle over dominance of Al-Sharat with newcomers from the tribe of Tayy. Though information about the Fatimid administration over the Levant is vague, Caliph Al-Aziz (975‚Äì996) may have made Al-Sharat (south of Wadi Mujib) its own province which lasted until the Crusader invasion in the early 12th century. The Crusaders annexed Al-Sharat in the 1110s. Initially, it was part of the royal demesne of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1126, the feudal lordship of Oultrejordain was formed out of the former district of Al-Sharat. Its jurisdiction extended from the Zarqa River in the north to the Red Sea in the south. The Crusaders built the fortresses of Montreal (Shawbak) in 1115 and Crac (Al-Karak) in 1145. Both became major centers of the lordship. By the mid-12th century, the inhabitants of Al-Sharat were mainly Bedouin from various Qaysi tribes. At that time, the Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi (d. 1165) wrote about the fertility of the district and that it produced an abundance of olives, almonds, figs, grapes and pomegranates. Bilad al-Sharat was conquered by the Ayyubids under Saladin in 1187. During Ayyubid rule, Syrian geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1229) noted that Al-Sharat was a mountainous region through which the Hajj caravan road from Damascus to Mecca passed. During Mamluk rule, Al-Sharat became Mamlakat al-Karak (Province of al-Karak). By the mid-19th century, Bedouin from the Huwaytat tribe were encroaching into the southern parts of Bilad al-Sharat, and amid the Bedouin-induced anarchy in the region, Christians from Tafilah and al-Karak began fleeing to the north. During that time, Bilad al-Sharat, with the exception of Aqaba, was largely part of the Ottoman district of Mutassarifyya al-Karak.

Palmer, the name Abrika comes from a personal name.Palmer, 1881, p. 13 History In 1852 Edward Robinson noted: \\"On approaching the village, we came upon the ruins of dwellings, some of them of hewn stones ; and I afterwards found among them a curved stone of an arch with a projecting shoulder, such as is seen in the remains of the theatre at Smyrna. The ruins we had come to examine are in the village itself. They consist of two rows of columns of an ancient temple, extending from east to west. The columns are of a whitish limestone. Of the northern row there are four standing in place, two prostrate, and fragments of two others. Of the southern row, three are standing and two are lying. One of the upright columns has an Ionic capital with delicate tracery work below the volutes. Its height in all is about twelve feet. Many large hewn stones are built into the walls of hovels around and among the columns ; but there are none that seem to be in place. That here was an ancient heathen temple there can be little doubt, but whether it was of Phoenician, Greek, or Roman origin, there exists no historic trace whatever to afford light or reward inquiry.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. 55-56; as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 108 In 1875, Victor Gu√©rin found the village to have 150 Metuali inhabitants.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 273 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it: \\"A village, built of stone, containing about 150 Metawileh, situated on a hill- top. It was evidently an early Christian village [..]. The country round is cultivated with figs, olives, and arable land ; there is a rock-cut birkeh and several cisterns in the village. Traces of an ancient paved road are to be found to the north in the valley, that may have formerly led up to the village.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 86 They further noted: \\"There are here the remains of an early Christian church. Two of the columns still stand in situ in the village, and one bears its capital of Corinthian design, resembling-those at Yarun. Several pedestals are also in situ, with the doubtful traces of an apse. Under this there is a rock-cut tomb, with the entrance outside the east end of the church, and the local under where the altar would probably be placed.

History The site originally housed a series of Via Crucis chapels (1765), resembling those found in the Sacro Monti of Lombardy and Piedmont. An ossuary was added in 1649 to house the remains of those killed by the plague; after the first world war, it became a repository and memorial for those fallen in the conflict. The site was refurbished during the 19th and 20th centuries. The painter Luigi Tagliaferri restored the Via Crucis. In 1985-1989, the painter Paolo Gerosa painted modern images for the chapel refurbished in a Neo-Romanesque style on the prior foundations. The grotto houses chapels dedicated to the Madonna of Lourdes and St John the Baptist (latter called Chiesa ai Morti). The latter chapel has a structure dating from 1289 erected to venerate a hermit named Giovanni who dwelt in the grotto in early medieval times. The interior of the main church has frescoes from 1578 and a stucco arch in the apse from 1648.

Edited by Kenneth Paul Kramer. Eugene, Oregon: Pick Wick Publications, 2013. (December 29, 1921 ‚Äì September 25, 2012) was an interdisciplinary, interreligious philosopher of dialogue. His intellectual career - spanning fifty years of study, teaching, writing, translating, traveling, mentoring, and co-founding the Institute for Dialogical Psychotherapy - has prompted a language of genuine dialogue. With illuminating range, he has applied Martin Buber‚Äôs philosophy of dialogue to the human sciences. After receiving his Ph.D. in religion and history from the University of Chicago in 1950, Friedman had a long career of teaching and publishing.  Early life  Friedman was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His father, Samuel Friedman, was a life-insurance salesperson. His mother, Fannie, a Rabbi‚Äôs daughter, was a social activist and voracious reader who loved ideas and profoundly influenced her son. As a young man, he practiced Hindu-inspired meditation and was declared a conscientious objector during World War II. He served with the Forest Service as a firefighter. At the end of the war, Friedman attended and graduated from Harvard University. As he began his academic career, he married Eugenia and they adopted two children, Dvora and David. After they divorced, Friedman moved to the west coast and married Aileen.  Writing career  One of Friedman's main contributions has been to articulate how dimensions (religious, literary, existentialist, sociological, and psychological) of Buber‚Äôs thought have reshaped the Human Sciences. Friedman was also a constructive philosopher and comparative religionist. In 1956, Friedman wrote a broad survey of Buber‚Äôs work available at that time, Martin Buber: The Life of Dialogue, which was the first introduction of Buber‚Äôs concepts in the English-speaking world. Of it, Buber wrote: ‚ÄúTo systematize a wild-grown thought as mine is, without impairing its elementary character seems to me a remarkable achievement.‚Äù He became friends with Elie Wiesel, a well-known Jewish author, and Abraham Joshua Heschel, a well-known Jewish religious philosopher. Throughout the rest of the 1950s and into the 1960s, Friedman‚Äôs English translations of Buber‚Äôs essays from the original German made them available in the United States for the first time. Two of Friedman‚Äôs main contributions to comparative religious and philosophical studies are inevitably linked by dialogue ‚Äì the \\"human image\\" and \\"touchstones of reality.\\" The ‚Äúhuman image‚Äù is described as an underlying dialogical attitude that calls us into being by pointing us towards meaningful choices between conflicting acts of values and as an ever-recurring unique response of our whole person to particular demand placed upon us. The metaphor ‚Äútouchstones of reality‚Äù emerged from his dialogues with different great world religions. Touchstones represent unique meetings between ourselves and people or texts which drill deeply into our sense of humanness. In 1984, along with Richard Hycner, Maurice Friedman co-founded the Institute for Dialogical Psychotherapy in San Diego. The Institute presented an approach to psychotherapy, which is not a ‚Äúschool‚Äù of psychotherapy as such. This approach may apply irrespective of the particular orientation toward therapy, or techniques utilized. It rests upon the belief that at the core of human existence, is interconnectedness with others ‚Äì the interhuman dimension.  Teaching career  Friedman was a Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies, Philosophy and Comparative Literature at San Diego State University, where he taught from 1973 to 1991, and was the Co-director of the Institute for Dialogical Psychotherapy in San Diego, where he taught in the two-year training program. From 1967 to 1973 he was Professor of Religion at Temple University, Philadelphia, where he was the Director of the Ph.D. Programs in Religion and Literature and in Religion and Psychology. From 1954 to 1966 he was on the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature at the New School for Social Research, New York City. From 1951 to 1964 he was Professor of Philosophy, Religion, and Literature at Sarah Lawrence College. He has also taught at the University of Chicago, Washington Hebrew Union College ‚Äì Jewish Institute of Religion ‚Äì Cincinnati, Pendle Hill (the Quaker Study Center at Wallingford, Pa.), Union Theological Seminary (New York City), the Washington (D.C.) School of Psychoanalysis, the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology (New York City), Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, Vassar College, the California School of Professional Psychology, San Diego, the University of Hawaii, International College, Los Angeles, William Lyon University and American Commonwealth University, San Diego.  Awards & recognition  Maurice Friedman held an S.B. magna cum laude in Economics from Harvard University (1943), an M.A. in English from Ohio State (1947), a Ph.D. in the History of Culture from the University of Chicago (1950), an honorary LL.D. from the University of Vermont (1961), and a Doctor of Humane Letters from the Professional School of Psychological Studies, San Diego (1986). In 1983 he received an M.A. in Psychology from International College. In 1984-85 he was San Diego State University‚Äôs first University Research Lecturer. In 1985 Professor Friedman received the Jewish National Book Award for biography for his Martin Buber‚Äôs Life and Work. He was Senior Fulbright Lecturer, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, 1987‚Äì88, and in January‚ÄìFebruary 1992 he gave seminars and lectures at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts in New Delhi.

It premiered on February 1, 2013, when it was released along with the rest of the first season on the American streaming service Netflix. Plot Frank (Kevin Spacey) is still sitting on the terrace of Freddy's, enjoying his first step to securing his revenge. He is off to meet part of the Democratic leadership for breakfast, where they discuss their course of action on how to handle the poorly-received education bill. They are interrupted by Remy Danton (Mahershala Ali), a former press secretary-turned-corporate lobbyists, who reminds Frank that his main client, SanCorp, has heavily invested in him. Meanwhile, Doug (Michael Kelly) finds something on Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner), President Walker's nominee for Secretary of State, but Frank refuses to use it. After leaking the draft of the education bill, Frank secures control of the legislation and lures Donald (Reed Birney) into becoming his scapegoat. Claire (Robin Wright) continues downsizing her staff at the Clean Water Initiative. Frank arranges a meeting with Zoe (Kate Mara) and hands her an editorial from a student newspaper in which Kern had denounced the Israeli occupation of the West Bank illegal. Despite reservations, Zoe and her editors decide to publish. During an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Kern is confronted with an advance copy of Zoe's article. Furthermore, Stamper manages to locate Roy Kapeniak (T.J. Edwards), Kern's former co-editor of the student newspaper. Frank decides to send Russo (Corey Stoll) to talk with Kapeniak, who reveals that it was actually his article, not Kern's. Russo asks him to lie about it and say that Kern wrote it. Barnes runs the story linking Kern to the editorial, ending his nomination. With everything already planned, Frank contacts Durant and has Barnes to leak the senator's (Jayne Atkinson) name as Kern's replacement in order to fuel early media speculation. Durant leads the polls and thus wins Vazquez's and Walker's support. Frank provides subtle affirmation of the choice. Cast =Main cast= * Kevin Spacey as U.S. Representative Francis J.

A port to the Amstrad CPC followed. It is an early example of the Metroidvania style, despite preceding both of the genre's namesakes. Plot An evil wizard has cursed the protagonist's hometown. The only way to lift the curse is to find and assemble all five pieces of the broken Golden Talisman, which the wizard has hidden in his lair. Gameplay Hero of the Golden Talisman takes place in side-scrolling maze spanning 512 screens. The player must navigate the world to locate the talisman pieces, one of which is hidden in each of the five main areas. In addition to running, jumping, and climbing, the player can shoot enemies by pressing the fire button. The player can also find useful items, which they can store in their inventory for later use. Some of these items enhance the player's abilities; for example, flags will upgrade the player's weapon. A minimap in the lower-left corner of the screen indicates which rooms have and have not been visited and alerts the player to the presence of items within a given room. Reception Your Commodore gave the game 6/10 for originality, 4/10 for playability, 4/10 for graphics, and 5/10 for value-for-money, saying \\"The game has some original ideas but they don't quite get together and the overall impression is uninspiring\\". Zzap! was more positive, awarding it 78%, calling it a \\"good arcade adventure\\", and praising the game's size. One of the three reviewers did not think the gameplay had enough variety to be worth the ¬£2.99 price tag. Another complained that using diagonals to jump forward and backward was too difficult with a standard Atari joystick. The magazine also compared the hero character to the spy from Impossible Mission.

The majority were constructed by Bethlehem Steel in 1931‚Äì1933; American Car and Foundry delivered additional cars in 1949. Some cars, rebuilt in 1964‚Äì1965 and christened \\"Blueliners\\", remained in service with Conrail and later the Southeast Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) until 1990. Several have been preserved.  Design  = Bethlehem Steel = Bethlehem Steel produced a total of 100 cars composed of three types: coaches, baggage- coaches, and baggage-coach-RPO. Each car carried the same dimensions: long, wide, and high. The coaches weighed between ; the various baggage-coach combines between . Power was supplied via overhead lines to two traction motors built by either Westinghouse or General Electric (GE). Maximum power output (over one hour) ranged from . In normal operation speed was limited to , although a maximum of was possible. The coaches, designated EPA (Nos. 800‚Äì860) and EPB (Nos. 861‚Äì888), carried a total of 86 passengers. The nine coach-baggage cars, designated ECA (Nos. 300‚Äì306) and ECB (Nos. 307‚Äì308) seated 62 each, while the two baggage-coach-RPOs, designated ECC, seated 38. A single restroom was located at the vestibule end. = American Car and Foundry = Externally the eight motor cars that American Car and Foundry (ACF) built were similar to the older Bethlehem Steel cars. The primary difference was that they carried four traction motors instead of two and could develop . Another important difference was the use of an oil-cooled transformer. As was common for the period the coolant contained polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); it was not until the 1960s that PCBs were phased out because of their toxicity. The presence of PCBs in the transformers led to the premature retirement of the ACF cars in lieu of a rebuild. At the cars were significantly heavier than the Bethlehem-built cars.  History  A set of electric multiple units outside the Reading Terminal in 1964. Unpowered trailer 799 is in the foreground. The Reading undertook the electrification of its Philadelphia commuter lines in the late 1920s. The first lines electrified were the Ninth Street Branch, New Hope Branch, the Bethlehem Branch as far as Lansdale, the Doylestown Branch, and the New York Branch to West Trenton. To protect this service the Reading ordered 89 electric multiple units from Bethlehem Steel: 61 coaches, seven baggage-coaches, and two baggage-coach- RPOs. These were supplemented by twenty unpowered coach trailers converted from existing coaches. The new electrified services began operation on July 26, 1931. The Reading extended electrification to the Norristown Branch and Chestnut Hill Branch in 1933. For this service the Reading ordered 30 additional cars from Bethlehem Steel, identical to the first batch: 28 coaches and two baggage-coaches. Following World War II Reading bought eight more coaches, this time from American Car and Foundry. They were paired with eight unpowered coach trailers converted from existing coaches. The new equipment arrived in 1949. Between 1963‚Äì1965 the Reading completely rebuilt 38 of the cars. These were designated RER and popularly known as \\"Blueliners\\" from their distinctive white-and-blue livery. The rebuilt cars were renumbered into the 9101‚Äì9138 range. Un-rebuilt cars were known colloquially as \\"Reading 'green' cars\\" as they remained in their original livery. Both the green cars and the Blueliners continued running under Conrail and SEPTA; a set of Blueliner cars formed the final train to leave Reading Terminal in 1984. Blueliners were also the last cars to operate to West Chester in 1986 when service on the West Chester Branch was cut back to Elwyn. SEPTA retired the last of its Blueliners from revenue service in 1990.

Even where he turns to more ambitious work he cannot abandon this method, and in the midst of a sentence he stops to make a most irrelevant explanation in brackets as to the scientific name of the native cat. On things Australian he is such an undoubted authority that it is no exaggeration to say that from his books, and from this book in particular, one may learn more about Australian life than from most of the so-called Australian novels put together.\\"\\"Reviews\\", The West Australian, 13 July 1901, p12 See also * Full text of the volume is available from the University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan - In Bad Company and Other Stories by Rolf Boldrewood * 1901 in Australian literature References Australian short story collections 1901 short story collections ","title":"In Bad Company and Other Stories"},{"id":"51514215","text":"Events from the year 1519 in Ireland.

She served as the principal lady in waiting, or dame d'honneur (Mistress of the Robes), to empress Jos√©phine de Beauharnais in 1804‚Äì09. Life She was born in Paris as the heiress of a rich plantation owner from Saint Domingue. Her father was allied to the Beauharnais family, and she married Alexandre, comte de La Rochefoucauld (1767‚Äì1841), in Paris on 9 June 1788. She had three sons and one daughter. Her daughter later married , a brother-in-law of Pauline Bonaparte, Princess Borghese. She had reportedly been an acquaintance of Josephine since before she became an empress. She was imprisoned during the Terror of Robespierre and had met Josephine soon after they had both been released from prison. In 1804, when Napoleon made himself Emperor and his wife Empress of France, he created an Imperial court and had ladies-in-waiting appointed to empress Josephine. de La Rochefoucauld was appointed to the position of dame d'honneur to the empress Josephine, which was the highest rank of all ladies- in-waiting, over ranking the dame d'atours, √âmilie de Beauharnais, and the dame du palais: Jeanne Charlotte du Lucay, Madame de R√©musat, Elisabeth Baude de Talhou√´t, Lauriston, d'Arberg, Marie Antoinette Duch√¢tel, Sophie de Segur, S√©ran, Colbert, Savary and Agla√© Louise Augui√© Ney. As dame d'honneur it was her task to supervise the ladies-in-waiting, organize the household of the empress, decide about the visits, invitations and presentations. She was described as highly efficient in her task.Andrea Stuart: Josephine: The Rose of Martinique. Described as a haughty grande dame and as an ancien regime royalist she is said to have cowed the emperor in to silence at times. Napoleon disliked her and called her \\"a little cripple, as stupid as she is ugly\\".Philip Mansel: The Court of France 1789‚Äì1830. According to Laure Junot, she never actually enjoyed her position and had to be persuaded by Josephine to accept it.Memoirs of the Duchess D'Abrant√®s: (Madame Junot) It is noted that she preferred not to use her apartment her position entitled her to at the Imperial palace. When Josephine was divorced from Napoleon in january 1810, Ad√©la√Øde de La Rochefoucauld applied to the emperor to be allowed to continue in her position as dame d'honneur for the next empress, Marie Louise of Austria. Napoleon was however shocked by her request, regarded it as disloyalty toward Josephine, and asked Josephine to dismiss her.* Annie Forbes Bush: Memoirs of the Queens of France, Vol. 2. She was replaced as the dame d'honneur of Josephine by one of the dame de palais, d'Arenberg, while the post of dame d'honneur of empress Marie Louise went to the Duchess of Montebello.

He is the current Seychellois record holder in the event. Azemia competed in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in the 400 metres hurdles. He has also competed in two World Junior Championships, an African athletics championships and an African Youth Games. Azemia has also raced over the flat 400 metres distance. Competition Azemia's debut at an international athletics competition was at the 2014 African Youth Games, where he won the bronze medal in the 400 metres hurdles with a time of 53.27 seconds. His placing at the African Youth Games qualified him for the 2014 World Junior Championships, where he competed in the 400 metres hurdles. He was disqualified from his heat and therefore eliminated from the competition. He then competed at the 2014 African Championships in Athletics in the 400 metres hurdles. Azemia raced in heat two and ran a time of 55.72 seconds. He was 6.39 seconds slower than the heat winner, Nicholas Bett of Kenya. Azemia failed to qualify for the next round. Azemia also competed in the 4 √ó 100 metres relay as part of a Seychelles team. The team reached the final but didn't race in it. Azemia competed at the IAAF World U20 Championships in July 2016 and was knocked out of the 400 metres hurdles in the semi-final round after his time of 51.64 seconds was not quick enough to qualify for the final. Earlier in the competition, he had run a Seychellois national junior record time of 51.50 seconds, to finish second in his heat and qualify for the semi-final round. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Azemia competed in the 400 metres hurdles. Azemia, who was the youngest Seychellois athlete at the Games, was drawn in heat three, a heat containing the London 2012 bronze medalist Javier Culson. In the race on 15 August 2016, Azemia ran a time of 50.74 seconds. Azemia's time was a personal best (beating his previous best of 51.09), and a new Seychellois national record. It was also a new Seychellois national junior record. After the race, Azemia told the Seychelles News Agency that \\"he knew going into the race that it would be difficult to qualify for the next round, but he was nevertheless happy with his performance\\". Seychelles Athletics Federation secretary Wilfred Adrienne said that, \\"It [the race] was great, an impressive performance for someone his age at such a high- level competition and we [the Seychelles Athletics Federation] are proud of him\\". Azemia's time was the 43rd-quickest out of 47 athletes. Azemia's time was 0.97 seconds slower than the slowest athlete to progress to the next round and, therefore, he was eliminated.

He is a member of the localist group Civic Passion and participated in the anti-parallel trading protests in 2015. In the 2015 local election, Cheng represented the Civic Passion to run against pro-democratic Democratic Party incumbent Albert Ho in Lok Tsui, where he secured 391 votes, while Ho lost his seat to a pro-Beijing candidate Junius Ho by a margin of 277 votes. In the 2016 Hong Kong Legislative Council election, Cheng represented the Civic Passion to run in the New Territories West. He took over Wong Yeung-tat's position as the leader of Civic Passion after his electoral victory. In 2017, Cheng was convicted and fined for the offence of flag desecration. He had turned some miniature Chinese and Hong Kong flags upside-down, flags that pro-Beijing legislators had placed on their desks in the Legislative Council chamber in 2016. They had been handed out by Edward Lau to his pro-Beijing colleagues as a reminder that the \\"country should be respected\\". Cheng regarded the flags as \\"cheap patriotic acts\\" and alleged that the pro-Beijing bloc was ignoring issues of actual importance to Hong Kong people. Lau subsequently called the police to report Cheng for flag desecration. On 29 September 2017, the Eastern Magistrates' Court found Cheng guilty and fined him $5,000. Lau subsequently complained that the punishment was too lenient, and referred to previous sentences of imprisonment for the same offence. On 31 August 2019, Cheng was one of several prominent democrats targeted in sweeping arrests made by police that day. Academic career From 2012 to 2018, Cheng has served as a teaching fellow at the Department of Applied Social Sciences at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He teaches classes on Hong Kong society, Chinese society, and popular culture. In 2016, he was criticised by Kaizer Lau, a member of the governing council of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University for supporting and organising violent protests and advocating for Hong Kong independence. Lau also called for the non-renewal of the employment contract of Cheng. Cheng lost this position on 30 June 2018 as his teaching contract had not been renewed by the university. He quoted a disciplinary letter from the university as stating: \\"Your conduct and convictions are inconsistent with the university‚Äôs commitment to quality education and aspiration to embrace internationalisation\\". He alleged that the university's actions were \\"political persecution\\" and were unrelated to his teaching performance.

Advocacy Soler became interested in anti- violence advocacy after heading a speech from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Bridgeport. In 1971, she became a social worker in San Francisco, assisting women in a drug treatment program. Solar learned that many of the women with drug dependencies had also suffered domestic abuse, and that trauma from that abuse was a leading contributor to their addictions. She also learned that law enforcement did not take domestic violence seriously, and frequently did not arrest the abusers. Soler established the Family Violence Prevention Fund in San Francisco in 1980 to develop responses to domestic violence nationwide. Soler has served a consultant and/or advisor for the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, the Aspen Institute, and the Soros Justice Fellowship Program. Soler's work to prevent violence against women was featured on MAKERS, an interactive video and documentary project launched by AOL and PBS.

She has been referred to as the 'Queen of Subtitlers'.  Career  Eisenman was born c. 1928 in Austria to a Jewish family who had been shoemakers going back several generations. She fled Austria as a child with her family in 1937. The family moved to Italy, France, Portugal and eventually settled in New York in 1940. She worked in radio and film production before beginning to work as a subtitler in the 1960s. She went into semi-retirement in the 1990s, working part of the time in her Manhattan office and spending summers with her dog on Long Island. In the course of her career Eisenman worked on the subtitles of over 300 films. She speaks English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. She subtitled films shot in other languages as well, including Dutch, Danish, Chinese and Japanese, by editing the raw translations and turning them into subtitles. She worked on films by many eminent European directors including Pedro Almod√≥var and √âric Rohmer. She worked closely with Louis Malle, subtitling his films Au revoir les enfants, Le souffle au coeur and Milou en Mai. She subtitled a number of Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated films including Babette's Feast, Belle √âpoque, The Restless Conscience: Resistance to Hitler Within Germany 1933-1945 and Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. In interviews Eisenman tended to be pragmatic about translation: \\"'The audience should be looking at the action, not reading. [...] Our job isn't that of the literary translator. Our job is to give the Cliff's Notes to a movie. In another interview she was quoted as saying \\"You're looking for clarity. [...] You don't need to send telegrams, condense everything into two words. You try to get the flavor of everything within the limits of what you can show.'\\" \\"The audience should not have to figure out the subtitles. If they do, you've lost your audience. They should be able to think about what's being said.\\" Eisenman also worked on dubbing projects, including the dubbing of the 1985 Argentinian film The Official Story, which won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

In animals, tissue growth occurs during embryonic development, post-natal growth, and tissue regeneration. The fundamental cellular basis for tissue growth is the process of cell proliferation, which involves both cell growth and cell division occurring in parallel. How cell proliferation is controlled during tissue growth to determine final tissue size is an open question in biology. Uncontrolled tissue growth is a cause of cancer. Differential rates of cell proliferation within an organ can influence proportions, as can the orientation of cell divisions, and thus tissue growth contributes to shaping tissues along with other mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis.  Mechanisms of tissue growth control in animals  = Mechanical control of tissue growth in animal skin = For some animal tissues, such as mammalian skin, it is clear that the growth of the skin is ultimately determined by the size of the body whose surface area the skin covers. This suggests that cell proliferation in skin stem cells within the basal layer is likely to be mechanically controlled to ensure that the skin covers the surface of the entire body. Growth of the body causes mechanical stretching of the skin, which is sensed by skin stem cells within the basal layer and consequently leads to both an increased rate of cell proliferation as well as promoting the planar orientation of stem cell divisions to produce new skin stem cells, rather than only producing differentiating supra-basal daughter cells. Cell proliferation in skin stem cells within the basal layer can be driven by the mechanically-regulated YAP/TAZ family of transcriptional co-activators, which bind to TEAD-family DNA binding transcription factors in the nucleus to activate target gene expression and thereby drive cell proliferation. For other animal tissues, such as the bones of the skeleton or the internal mammalian organs intestine, pancreas, kidney or brain, it remains unclear how developmental gene regulatory networks encoded in the genome lead to organs of such different sizes and proportions. = Hormonal control of tissue growth in the entire animal body = Although different animal tissues grow at different rates and produce organs of very different proportions, the overall growth rate of the entire animal body can be modulated by circulating hormones of the Insulin/IGF-1 family, which activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in many cells of the body to increase the average rate of both cell growth and cell division, leading to increased cell proliferation rates in many tissues. In mammals, production of IGF-1 is induced by another circulating hormone called Growth Hormone. Excessive production of Growth Hormone or IGF-1 is responsible for giantism while insufficient production of these hormones is responsible for dwarfism. = Developmental control of tissue growth during adult tissue homeostasis = Adult animal tissues such as skin or intestine maintain their size but undergo constant turnover of cells by proliferation of stem cells and progenitor cells while undergoing an equivalent loss of differentiated daughter cells via sloughing off. Gradients of Wnt signaling pathway activity appear to have a fundamental role in maintaining proliferation of stem and progenitor cells, at least in the intestine, and possibly also in skin. = Regenerative tissue growth after wounding or other types of damage = Upon tissue damage, there is an upregulation in the activity of many pathways that control tissue growth, including the YAP/TAZ pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and growth factors that activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.

Sculpture, painting and carving blended with the architecture, sometimes to encourage classical architectural schemes that remain in force in floors and elevations. Facing the outside, usually austere, are creates vibrant interiors. This late-Baroque which employs profusely ornamental motifs as acanthus leaf, of Classical roots, begins to soak in the 1730s from the influence of French Rococo, exemplified mainly in the dissemination of a new decorative motif: the rocaille (the French rocaille), consisting of complicated sets of \\"C\\" and \\"S\\" that generate asymmetrical shapes and also remind marine forms. The rocaille became known in Spain through three main ways: dissemination through the pattern books, the importation of furniture and other decorative arts from Europe and its direct brought hand of foreign architects, case of the Portuguese Cayetano de Acosta. Thus, for the Spanish case it is difficult to speak of the existence of a pure Rococo but, rather, a late-Baroque that borrows elements of the French Rococo. The generic name of Rococo for the Spanish art of the 18th century due to an outdated tendency to consider the Rococo as the logical evolution of the Baroque. Given that this style was born in France, where the art of the previous century, known as the Grand Si√®cle was substantially different from the Spanish case, for its character was more classicist. Therefore, the style was born as rather more like a reaction than as an evolution of 17th century French. Moreover, the Rococo is an art eminently bourgeois and secular, difficult to reconcile with religious art, the most abundant of the Spanish Baroque. This traditional terminological confusion has contributed to the presence in the 18th century of Italian architects and solutions brought of Italian Baroque (more moved in ground), but outside the Rococo but confused with it. However, apart of the questionable footprint of the Rococo in the 18th century Spanish religious art, it is possible to trace some examples of Rococo in Spain, mainly in civil typologies and, especially, in the Court area, at the heat of the new Bourbon dynasty. Architecture and reredoses In the courtly atmosphere of Madrid are between the most beautiful examples of Spanish Rococo. In the Royal Palace of Madrid, commissioned by Philip V of Spain in 1738, are the Sal√≥n de Gasparini and Sal√≥n de Porcelana halls. In the same palace are found the Sal√≥n del Trono hall, many examples of Rococo furniture as the twelve monumental mirrors accompanied by its respective consoles and the royal throne. In Aranjuez, find a singular piece in the Sal√≥n de Porcelana hall of the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, jewel richly decorated at the time of Carlos III of Spain with chinoiserie motifs very appreciate due orientalizing and exotic of the Rococo. Also in the capital of Spain are some temples which are influenced in the Rococo, like Bas√≠lica Pontificia de San Miguel, designed by Italian architect Santiago Bonav√≠a in 1739.

Historical documents indicate that in the early 1860s there were at least six mills reducing Comstock ore in Washoe Valley and during these earliest days of the Comstock mining. Steamboat Springs near Galena also drains into Steamboat Creek which was the location of Castle Peak mine. Mercury can be found in tributaries of Steamboat Creek as a result of mining during the 1860s. Due to the difficulty of trans-porting both ore down from Virginia City and timber up the steep grade to Virginia City from Washoe City during the mid 1800s, especially in winter, the sites of extensive milling began to change and Carson City and the Carson River were sources for hauling ore down and lumber up to Virginia City during the mid-1860s In the late 1800s, mills in the Washoe Lake area, Nevada, used mercury (Hg) to remove gold and silver from the ores of the Comstock deposit. Since that time, mercury has been found in Washoe Lake, down Steamboat Creek, and to the Truckee River. The creek continues to be a source of mercury to the Truckee River. Studies have been conducted to determine concentrations of total and methylmercury (MeHg) in surface sediments in the Steamboat Creek watershed. Mercury concentrations measured in channel and bank sediments did not decrease downstream, indicating that mercury contamination has been distributed along the creek's length. Steamboat Creek flows past the newly built Reno Fire House and into the tributary of what is now Marsh Lands of Damonte Ranch Development. Both pond/wetland and channel sites exhibited making up Steamboat Creek show high potential for mercury.

In 1760, she married the courtier count Christian Frederik Moltke (1736‚Äì1771).

Although her spouse was on the queen's side against the king's favorite Conrad Holck, he lost his office in 1771 and the couple had to leave court. When Moltke died shortly after, a scandal occurred when his widow was accused of having caused his death by infecting him with a venereal disease, by having caused him to commit suicide out of sorrow because of her adultery, or by having been poisoned by her and her lover courtier nobleman Karl Adolf von Plessen. In 1771, she married Karl Adolf von Plessen shortly after she became a widow, which made them suspicious. They were never openly accused.

It was designed by Francis Drummond Greville Stanley and built in 1888 by A Anderson. It is now known as Historic House Museum. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Queensland National Bank, circa 1889 The former bank building was constructed in Charleville in 1888 as the premises of the Queensland National Bank, which had established a branch in the town in 1881. The town of Charleville was surveyed in 1867 following the surveying of a number of pastoral runs in the district in 1863. Sited on the banks of the Warrego River along a stock route from New South Wales to Western Queensland, the town was to develop as the major service centre for the surrounding pastoral industry. Bullock teams passed through the town, Cobb & Co established stables (as well as a factory for the construction of mail coaches and buggies and an associated sawmill) and in 1888 Charleville's position as a strategic transport node for the south west was confirmed when it became the terminus for the main Western railway line which was extended south to Cunnamulla in 1898 and west to Quilpie in 1917. The Queensland National Bank was the first bank to open a branch in Charleville on 30 July 1881. The Queensland National Bank was the first and most successful of Queensland's three indigenous 19th century banks. It was established in March 1872 by a group of prominent Queensland squatters, politicians, lawyers, and businessmen who wished to secure development capital free from overseas or intercolonial control. Its first office was established in Queen Street, Brisbane in that year and the bank attracted widespread Queensland patronage. In 1879 it secured the whole of the Queensland Government's banking business. By 1880 it held 40% of deposits in the colony and dominated the Queensland economy. In 1888 a larger bank premises was constructed at Charleville to the design of F.D.G. Stanley and built by A Anderson for the sum of . FDG Stanley trained as an architect in Scotland and emigrated to Queensland in 1861. He joined the office of the Queensland Colonial Architect as a clerk in 1863 and was appointed Colonial Architect 1872. He held this position until 1881 when resigned to work full time in private practice. Among his regular clients were several banks including the Queensland National Bank, the Anglican Church and merchant companies. Stanley was one of the most successful architects to practice in nineteenth century Queensland and his work includes the Supreme Court building (Brisbane, burned down), the General Post Office (Brisbane), St Paul's Anglican Church (Maryborough), the Queensland Club (Brisbane) and the Queensland National Bank (Brisbane, no longer extant). Stanley designed timber buildings for the Queensland National Bank in St George, Normanton, Allora and Blackall.leftThe Charleville bank combined business and accommodation areas, as was common practice at the time for branch offices. At the front of the building were a public access area with a teller's area and safe and a manager's office. The rear section of the building provided living accommodation for the manager and his family, including a room for their maid. This and the quality of finish in the building suggest the social position of a manager of the bank in a regional town. In 1942, probably as the result of a wartime rationalisation of branches in smaller centres, the Charleville branch was sold to Mr Alex Smith who used it as a residence during his lifetime. In 1948, the Queensland National Bank merged with the National Bank of Australasia, later the National Australia Bank. After the death of Mr Smith his daughter, Mrs Claude Young, converted it into a boarding house, and upon her death the Charleville and District Cultural and Historical Society purchased the building, which is now a local history museum.  Description  Side view, 2017 The former Queensland National Bank at Charleville is a single storey timber building with an exposed frame and is set on low stumps. It has a hipped roof clad with corrugated iron roof. There are verandahs to the front and sides of the building that have a corrugated iron clad awning supported by timber posts. A projecting central portico rising through the verandah awning marks the entrance to the building and is reached by timber steps. Interior, 1942 Internally the building features high ceilings and cedar joinery and has four marble fireplaces. Several of the rooms are furnished as a place museum. There is a picket fence to the street.  Heritage listing  The former Queensland National Bank in Charleville was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Queensland National Bank building is important in illustrating the development of Queensland as purpose-built premises for a bank formed to serve Queensland interests and needs when the state was a self- governing colony. The quality of its design and construction also demonstrate the importance of this regional branch at a time when Charleville was firmly established as a centre for the pastoral industry of southwest Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Queensland National Bank is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era, being a good example of a timber structure combining a banking chamber, office and manager's residence; a type common for rural bank buildings from the nineteenth century until World War II. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a well-designed and detailed building the former Queensland National Bank contributes to the townscape of Charleville. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Queensland National Bank has a special association with the life and work of architect FDG Stanley, who designed a number of banks for the Queensland National Bank. It is also associated with the development of the QN Bank, the earliest of Queensland's indigenous banks.

It was designed by William Hodgen junior and built from 1924 to 1929 by day labour. It is also known as Corones Hotel Norman. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 July 1997.  History  The town of Charleville was surveyed in 1867 following the surveying of a number of pastoral runs in the district in 1863. Sited on the banks of the Warrego River along a natural stock route from New South Wales to Western Queensland, the town was to develop as the major service centre for the surrounding pastoral industry. Bullock teams passed through the town, Cobb & Co established stables (as well as a factory for the construction of mail coaches and buggies and an associated sawmill) and in 1888 Charleville's position as a strategic transport node for the south west was confirmed when it became the terminus for the Western railway line (extended south to Cunnamulla in 1898 and west to Quilpie in 1917). The first half of the 1920s was a time of economic prosperity in Queensland unrivalled for three decades. The boom was sustained longer in the building sector than in others; and in Brisbane the transformation of the city's central business district was a tangible legacy of the boom. In Charleville the main streets gave an air of solid prosperity to this centre of one of the richest areas of western Queensland: > ... it has fine hotels, stores, offices of the leading pastoral firms, and a > full complement of general business concerns. There is a most attractive > School of Arts, Town Hall, [and] three churches ... There is a most > excellent club, the \\"Warrego\\" ... The fledgling Qantas commenced their first commercial services from the town in 1922 (\\"replacing\\" the last Cobb & Co coach which ran in 1920); in 1924 the town turned on electric lights; and in 1926 a new Town Hall was completed. However a severe drought in 1926 described by the Charleville Chamber of Commerce as the worst season known by black or white man with losses of sheep to the enormous extent of eleven millions was to bring the state's pastoral and agricultural sectors to collapse and many rural towns entered a slow decline into the worldwide depression of the 1930s. On the cusp of the boom/bust, Harry Corones was to commence building his grand vision of hospitality for the west to rival the capital's best hotels. Born on the Greek island of Kythera, Harry \\"Poppa\\" Corones arrived in Australia in the early 1900s coming to Charleville by 1909 when he was recorded in the Post Office Directories as a \\"fruiterer\\". Reputedly on the encouragement of a brewing company representative, Corones became in 1912 the licensee of the Hotel Charleville, which he operated until 1924. In 1926 Corones became the registered owner of the Hotel Norman, a single storeyed hotel established located a block south of the Hotel Charleville on the corner of Wills and Galatea Street. In an advertisement in Pugh's Almanac for 1905, proprietor DC McDonald claimed the hotel as: > the leading hotel of the southern western line ... the home of the > pastoralist, agriculturalist and tourist with lofty cool bedrooms, hot and > cold baths, and good paddocking ... Such claims would be later repeated and amplified by Corones regarding his own hotel. Construction of Corones Hotel Norman (as it was then called) commenced in 1924. Rising phoenix-like on the site of the old Norman Hotel, the ambitious scheme was built in four stages from the south to the north to enable continuation of trade; the construction dates displayed at either end of the building testifying to the five year enterprise. Significantly, given the number of (timber) buildings in the town destroyed by fire including Corones' former hotel the Charleville (actually destroyed by fire twice), Harry Corones' new hotel was a masonry building. The first two stages were of reinforced concrete, the third including the ballroom and final stages of brick. Costing some the hotel was built by day labour with preference given to men of the district. By the end of 1926 the new hotel was two thirds complete; only the bar area of the Norman Hotel remained. The mythology of Corones was also well advanced. According to the Australian Pastoralist, Grazing Farmers' and Selectors Gazette the hotel was the topic of conversation from Roma to Eulo, and out to the far west and north: > ... In every way the new Hotel Corones will be an example of hotel > architecture and comfort scarce equalled in the Southern Hemisphere, and > will undoubtedly be a great centre for all western men. The final stage of building was completed in 1929. The hotel now stretched almost an entire block of Charleville's main street. According to the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland it was: > \\"a magnificent white building ... an outstanding feature in a progressive > town ... the best equipped and most up-to-date hotel outside the metropolis > ... generally acknowledged as the calling-place of all distinguished > tourists and travellers...\\" The hotel itself produced a 12-page brochure about this time which included black-and-white photographs of the interior: on the ground floor the lounge had gleaming copper-topped tables, deep leather lounges and chairs and led to a writing room and telephone booth; the dining room, enticing in its cleanliness, was capable of seating 150; the private bar which gave exclusive service amidst convivial surroundings was screened from the public bar by an ingenious arrangement a French polished oak partition with mirrors; the public bar was very modern and luxurious and a cool cement court-yard formed an entrance to the ball-room. Upstairs all accommodation rooms opened onto the verandah ‚Äì some were equipped with their own bathrooms designed to please the most fastidious, and the upstairs lounge was just the place for a real restful smoke. Corones Hall located on Galatea Street had a floor unexcelled outside Brisbane and was largely in demand for exclusive balls, parties, and banquets. Capable of seating 320 at dinner, the hall was built for coolness with a number of high-set windows and electric ceiling fans. The lights with Venetian shades of various hues were adjustable either to dimness or the reverse, and an orchestra platform added to its popularity and beauty. Furnishings throughout, including the bedroom furniture, dining room, lounge room, chairs, settees, sideboards, etc., were designed and manufactured by the well-known Queensland home furnisher F Tritton Ltd of George Street Brisbane using beautiful Queensland wood, the Queensland maple. Carpets, linoleums, floor coverings, curtains, etc. (British throughout) were all laid and fitted by Trittons. The architect of this magnificent modern hotel was William Hodgen jnr (1867-1943). The son of pioneer Toowoomba building contractor William Hodgen, in 1886 he became a cadet in the Colonial Architect's Office and in 1891 enrolled at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London whilst working with a number of prominent London architects. In December 1896 he returned to Queensland commencing practice the following year in Toowoomba when he immediately received a substantial commission from retailer TC Beirne for works to his newly established Fortitude Valley premises as well as winning a competition for a new wing to the Toowoomba Hospital (the Victoria Wing). In practice until his death in 1943 (from 1935 in partnership with his sons as W Hodgen and Hodgen), Hodgen's practice, like that of contemporary Harry Marks (1871-1939) (who also was a member of one of Queensland's architectural family dynasties) was both extensive and broadranging from domestic (e.g. the Toowoomba residences \\"Tor\\" (1904) and Tyson Manor (1905), institutional (e.g. Glennie Memorial School (1914), to industrial (e.g. flour mill and wheat and flour stores for Crisp O'Brien 1911) and a number of hotels in western towns including in Charleville, the Hotel Charleville (1913; rebuilt again after a second fire 1931). Hodgen's second Hotel Charleville was similar but of a smaller scale to the Hotel Corones - both had lost the classical and arts and crafts elements typical of his early hotels, and instead adapted simplified Art Deco decoration on the facade. Both hotels are a dominant presence in Charleville's main street; but it is the Hotel Corones which is regarded as Hodgen's major single work and the highlight of his career. For over thirty years the Hotel Corones (\\"The Leading Hotel of the West\\") flourished as a tourist, pastoral and CTA (Commercial Travellers Association) House. Harry Corones' advertisements and stationery proclaimed vice-regal patronage; and in addition to wealthy local graziers, celebrities such as Amy Johnson, Gracie Fields, and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were guests at the hotel. In 1936 there were on average 133 guests per week and during World War II when American servicemen occupied the local aerodrome and hospital, \\"Poppa\\" Corones did a roaring trade with dances held \\"every night\\" in Corones Hall. In 1959, the state's centenary year, Charleville's civic welcome to its Royal visitor, HRH Princess Alexandra took place in front of the hotel and Corones' advertisement in the town's centenary souvenir book could still proclaim that: > Charleville Means CORONES because Corones is the centre of Charleville's > social activities and the rendezvous where business agreements can be made > in surroundings which, by their comfort and restfulness, provide the perfect > setting for quiet consideration. People who insist on the best in fine > living invariably made Corones their home while in Charleville. Just a few years later, however, a Licensing Commission Report described the Hotel Corones as being overtaken by a new type of hospitality accommodation, the motel in the shape of the newly rebuilt Victoria Hotel-Motel. Drought in the 1960s was also to severely impact on the local (including Corones') economy; the heyday of both the town and the Hotel was over. In 1972 Harry Corones died; his elder son, Peter and wife Mary who had operated the hotel for some time prior to Harry Corones' death continued its stewardship. In 1982 the hotel was acquired by Doreen and Bob Bishop. It changed hands again in 1989. In 1990 a motel was erected to the rear of the hotel: in April of that year, the disastrous flood which covered much of the town, entered the ground floor of the hotel. As a result, substantial works including the restoration of the main stair were carried out; about this time some bedrooms on the upper floor were also converted into bathrooms and what are believed to be the former Commercial Travellers' sample rooms on Galatea Street were converted into a shop and motel style accommodation. In 1993, the hotel was listed by the National Trust of Queensland. The Hotel Corones is now operated by Gordon and Frances Harding as both a local pub and (in recognition of the hotel's iconic status) a cultural tourist attraction in the state's south west: Corones Hall is regularly used for functions such as weddings and balls, daily tours of the hotel are conducted by Mrs Harding, and the mythology of both the man and his hotel continues. In February 2014, the hotel was sold to ERI Partners which plans to expand the range of the hotel's dining and entertainment options.  Description  Dining room, circa 1930 Sitting room, circa 1930 Corones Hotel is a two storey rendered brick and re-inforced concrete building running on a north‚Äìsouth axis along Wills Street (Charleville's main street and part of the Warrego Highway) between Galatea and Edward Streets, Charleville. It has an adjoining single storey ballroom and a hall running to the east along Galatea Street. A bar, foyer, dining room, kitchen, shops, ballroom, hall and toilets and three shops occupy the ground floor; accommodation rooms and a guest lounge are located on the first floor. There are single storey contemporary motel units in the south east corner of the site which are not considered of cultural heritage significance. A double story building, including staff quarters on the upper level and garages below, is located behind the motel units. The building has a wide two- storey verandah which extends over the footpath running down Wills Street and returning along Galatea Street. The verandah has a straight roof and is constructed of timber supported by timber posts with brackets at their tops. There is a simple timber battened balustrade at the first floor. A high parapet with projecting piers sits above the verandah along Galatea and Wills Streets and returns along the southern elevation from Wills Street and runs south back from Galatea Street. The parapet is accentuated with shaped gable sections at each end and centrally along Wills Street and at the Galatea Street and south ends. A small cornice runs along the top of the parapet and the name HOTEL CORONES is cast in relief with a surrounding border on the south and north ends and centrally along Wills Street. Construction dates AD 1924 and AD 1929 are on the south and north ends of the building respectively. A heavy cornice with supporting dentils runs above the verandah roof between the shaped gables along Wills and Galatea Streets. The main roof is a skillion form and is clad in corrugated iron. A rear verandah is situated on the south eastern corner of the building and the kitchen wing with two prominent attached fireplaces extends at right angles from the rear of the building. The exterior to the ground floor is punctuated with doors to the main entrance foyer from Wills Street and entrances to the bar from both Wills and Galatea Street. Deep casement windows, some of which have leadlight designs, are regularly positioned along both street frontages. A tiled dado runs along the walls to the bar and to the three shops on the southern end of the building where aluminium windows have been installed. At first floor level accommodation rooms open onto verandahs through French doors. Adjoining the hotel to the east is a single storey ballroom with a central door and two symmetrically positioned windows with semi circular heads either side. The facade of this part of the building is plain with a simple cornice that forms a parapet to the flat roof over. Adjoining this area is Corones Hall. The Hall is set back from Galatea Street and is entered from a centrally positioned set of heavy wooden doors. The facade is rendered to the height of the adjoining ballroom roof and has piers supporting a dentilled cornice which rises over the entrance in a semicircular pediment. Above this is a brick gabled stepped parapet with projecting piers and plaster coping. The brick work has decorative diamond patterning at the apex of the gable and at each side above the cornice. The name CORONES' HALL is inscribed in plaster relief on a plaster tablet on the gable above the entrance door. The interior of the hotel retains its original detailing. The foyer has silky oak panelling, decorated plaster ceilings, and leadlight windows. The main stair is silky oak. Many original furnishings remain.  Heritage listing  The Hotel Corones in Charleville was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 July 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Riding on the statewide economic boom of the 1920s, Harry \\"Poppa\\" Corones built his hotel which was to become a byword for hospitality in the west. Spanning nearly a block of Charleville's main street, the Hotel Corones was also to become in the succeeding decades, a symbol of both the prosperity and the changing fortunes of the town and the pastoral industry of south west Queensland, which it served. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The man and his hotel became synonymous: the use of the Corones name as the hotel name represented a significant break in the English tradition of the naming of hotels within an accepted nomenclature, a marketing strategy which was to see both the man and his hotel achieve (a joint and severable) iconic status in the west. That this icon was also of Greek origin was even more singular: Greek migration to Queensland in this century was most visible in the small business sector; the Greek cafe and green grocer became standard fixtures in the state's cities and throughout rural Queensland. Harry Corones' move into the hotel industry and the scale in which it was undertaken (uncompromisingly proclaimed by his ambitious plans for the Hotel Corones) represented a significant leap. Moreover, in the (predominantly British) mythology of the (Queensland) west, the Greek hero was (and is) a rarity. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Hotel Corones is the major work of architect William Hodgen whose Toowoomba practice extended throughout the west including a number of country hotels including others in Charleville (Hotel Charleville 1912; and the Hotel Corone's close relative the Hotel Charleville as rebuilt (again) 1931). A dominant landmark in the Charleville townscape, the quality and intactness of the hotel in particular the interiors (including not only the accommodation areas of the hotel, foyer, and dining room, but also uncommonly, a substantially intact bar area) as well as furnishings and fittings make the Hotel Corones an exceptional example of an intact interwar hotel (albeit one conceived on a grand scale). The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. In common with so many Queensland country towns, a number of timber buildings in Charleville (including the hotel previously leased by Harry Corones, the Hotel Charleville) had been destroyed by fire. The Hotel Corones was one of several substantial masonry buildings erected in Charleville during the 1920s and 1930s: particularly given that so few of the earlier major buildings of the town remain these buildings are an important part of the built fabric of the town as well as a demonstrable attempt to break with a rather bleak tradition associated with the use of timber as a building material in the hot dry climate of the west. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Riding on the statewide economic boom of the 1920s, Harry \\"Poppa\\" Corones built his hotel which was to become a byword for hospitality in the west. Spanning nearly a block of Charleville's main street, the Hotel Corones was also to become in the succeeding decades, a symbol of both the prosperity and the changing fortunes of the town and the pastoral industry of south west Queensland, which it served. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.

During her naval career she captured a number of French privateers while on the Jamaica station. After her sale she became an armed whaler sailing under a letter of marque. As a privateer she captured two French whaling vessels but then is no longer listed after 1810. Naval career The Royal Navy commissioned Swallow in October 1795 under the command of Commander George Fowke. He sailed her for the Jamaica station on 10 December. On 20 March 1796 Swallow was part of the squadron under the command of Rear-Admiral Hugh Cloberry Christian Christian in that escorted a convoy to the West Indies. On 27 January 1797 Swallow captured the French privateer schooner Molinette. Swallow had been sailing from Cape Nichola Mole, when she encountered Molinette. Molinette was armed only with two swivel guns and had a crew of 18 men, four of whom where aboard an American schooner she had captured on 26 January. Molinette had left Gonaives on 21 January with the object of capturing American vessels travelling between British ports. On 11 March Swallow captured the French privateer schooner Port au Paix about four leagues outside Cape Nichola Mole. Port au Paix was armed with two swivel guns and carried a crew of 17 men. She had left Port au Paix four days earlier and not captured anything. Between April and June Swallow captured the French privateer schooner G√©n√©ral Toussaint. G√©n√©ral Toussaint mounted eight guns and had a crew of five men. Between October 1797 and March 1798 Swallow captured the French privateer Petit Resource. She was armed with two 3-pounder guns and two swivel guns. In August 1798 Commander William Chilcott replaced Fowkes, who had received promotion to post-captain on 9 July. Swallow captured the French privateer Buonaparte on 20 September 1798. Bonaparte was armed with six guns and had a crew of 50 men. On 13 January 1799, , under the command of Captain George Fowke, and Swallow captured the Spanish brig Carmini. Between 12 February 1799 and April, Swallow captured one merchant vessel. In June 1799, Commander John Hayes replaced Sanderson. Between 22 July and 27 October 1799 Swallow captured three merchant vessels: *Spanish schooner Saint Cecilia, sailing from Porto Rico to Jamaica (with a false pass), carrying fustic; *Small French schooner-rigged boat, sailing from Jeremie to Cuba, carrying 26 bags of coffee and 65 watches; Swallow removed the cargo and sent the boat on her way; and, *Spanish brig Florentina, of 150 tons, sailing from Campeachy to Cuba with a cargo of logwood and rice. During that same period when she was in company with and , she shared in the capture of five merchant vessels, one a letter of marque: *Spanish Letter of marque ship Navarra (alias Diligene), of eight guns and 150 tons, sailing from Bilboa to Vera Cruz with a cargo of wine, iron, and writing paper; *Spanish zartan Ambrosia, sailing from Cadiz to Vera Cruz with 26¬Ω tons of quicksilver and 10 tons of writing paper; *Spanish brig San Francisco, of 90 tons, sailing from Campeachy to Havana, carrying a cargo of sugar and logwood; *Spanish schooner Maria Josepha, sailing from New Orleans to Havana, with cotton, cochineal, and logwood; and, *Spanish schooner Tres Amigos, of 109 tons, sailing from Vera Cruz to Havana, carrying logwood, hides, and soap. Between 28 February 1800 and 20 May, Swallow detained two Spanish schooners: *St. Josef, sailing from Truxillo to Kingston, carrying gums and indigo; and * *Nostra Senora de Arangaze, carrying indigo and specie. In the period from 20 May to 8 August, Swallow detained the Spanish felucca Baldenaro, which was carrying oil and wine. Between 3 August 1800 and 3 January 1801, Swallow detained three vessels: *Spanish schooner privateer Atlas, of 95 tons; *Spanish polacre N. S. del Remedios, of 100 tons, carrying dry goods; and, *Danish schooner Hercules, of 60 tons, carrying dry goods. In May 1801, Commander John Davie replaced Hayes. Disposal: The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy first offered \\"Swallow, 381 Tons, Copper-Bottomed and Copper-fastened, lying at Portsmouth\\" for sale on 7 August 1802. She sold there that month. Privateer and whaler \\"Metcalf\\" purchased Swallow.Lloyd's Register (1803), Supplement, Seq. ‚ÑñS42. Her master was David Smyth Simmons (or David Symonds Smith, or C.F. Smith). David Smyth Simmons received a letter of marque on 1 June 1803. She then sailed on 26 June.British Southern Whale Fishery Database - Voyages: Swallow. Around 15 May 1804 Swallow sent the French whaler Hero (H√©ros) into Falmouth.Lloyd's List 22 May 1804, ‚Ññ4455. During the Peace of Amiens, the French resumed whaling and on 10 February 1803 Captain Stephen Rawson sailed Hero from Le Havre for Walvis Bay, where she stayed for a month from 24 May to 23 June. Hero sailed in company with Baleine, of Le Havre, Captain Reuben Baxter. Between 10 July and 15 August they cruised the coast, but after having gathered only 200 barrels of oil, they sailed first to St Helena and then to St Catherine, Brazil. Swallow captured both Hero and Baleine. Swallow was reported to have arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 17 August 1804. As noted earlier, Swallow took Hero back to Britain. Swallow apparently abandoned Baleine, though in what state, and what happened to her subsequently, is not clear. There are accounts that Swallow engaged in whaling in 1807 and 1809-10. Although there is no record of her in Lloyd's Register after 1805, she does appear in the Register of Shipping in 1809 with F. Smyth, master, Metcalf, owner, and trade London-South Seas fisheries.Register of Shipping (1809), Seq.‚Ññ780. She is last listed in 1810 with the same information.

It caters for primary and secondary schooling from K-12. It has boarding house facilities and is owned and operated by the Anglican Church.  Information In 2018, The Glennie School had a student body of 773 students, 3.6 percent of which were of Aboriginal descent. 160 students were borders.  History  Benjamin Glennie The first Anglican priest on the Darling Downs was Benjamin Glennie, who spent much of his life raising funds to establish churches and schools for the Darling Downs, including growing and selling vegetables in his garden. He accomplished the construction of four churches in his lifetime but did not establish the schools. However, at his death, he had purchased a block of land in Newtown, Toowoomba and accrued a sum of ¬£1000 towards the construction of the schools. After Glennie's death in April 1900, the Anglican Synod in June 1900 decided to establish a number of Glennie Memorial Schools in memory of Glennie and his work, opening the Glennie Memorial Fund to attract public subscriptions. Although the original plans were to establish both a school for boys and a school for girls, funds were harder to raise than expected due to the drought on the Darling Downs. In June 1907, the Anglican Church decided to proceed with the establishment of a girls' school because there was an ¬£800 bequest which would lapse if construction did not commence by end of 1907. The choice of a school for girls was made because the church felt this was the area of greatest need as there were a number of secondary schools for boys already available.

Their Headquarters are in Hong Kong, China. Zama supplies mainly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of gasoline-powered outdoor tools, e.g. Stihl, Husqvarna or Yamabiko and claims itself to be the technology leader in their industry.  History  Zama was founded on 1 September 1952 as Shinagawa Die-Casting Co. Ltd. in Shinagawa City Tokyo, Japan by Kato Jiro. With 20 employees, Zama primarily focused on producing Automobile parts for Japanese companies. In 1962 the company was moved to Zama City, Kanagawa Prefecture near Yokohama, Japan which had an influence on the later name of the company: Zama. In July 1975, the number of employees had reached approximately 200, and Zama entered into the carburetor business, which is their core business area today. = Expansion = In September 1981, the first location abroad was established in Torrance, California, United States as USA Zama Inc. to support the Headquarters in Japan by marketing, importing and delivering Zama carburetors to American customers. After four years another factory was opened in Iwate, Japan which specialized in diaphragm carburetor assembly as well as die designing and tooling. In March 1989, Zama Industries was founded in Hong Kong to reduce the negative impact on revenue caused by a sudden change of the currency exchange rate of JPY and USD. Another facility was opened in November 1990 in Franklin, Tennessee, USA to expand the US operations in engineering and to establish a Zama aftermarket department. In August 1991, a second factory with 400 employees was opened in Iwate, Japan to meet the demands for more capacity. The factory was opened for die-casting and machining for automobile parts. By the end of 1991, a factory with 450 employees was opened in the Special Economic Zone of XiLi, Shenzhen, China and major parts of the Hong Kong facilities were moved there. The main focus of this facility is the production of diaphragm carburetors. Due to the strong growth, the factory was extended in 1997 and in 2000. In 2006, when direct labor headcount had surpassed 1,000 employees, all production facilities were consolidated in one factory site in Shenzhen and a die-casting and storage facility in Hong Kong. Due to rising risk of only one main production site, Zama decided to open a second main production facility in Santo Tomas, Batangas, Philippines which was inaugurated in January 2016. In 2018 the XiLi factories were relocated to a new factory in Huizhou, China due to municipal plans to remodel the former industrial area of XiLi into a commercial/residential zone. = Development of product variety = Starting out with the production and distribution of die-casting products, Zama developed into the world‚Äôs largest manufacturer of diaphragm carburetors and sells further products nowadays. Zama's first carburetor was produced in 1975, and the production of oil pumps was initiated in 2003. Further milestones for Zama were the production of their first electronic carburetor in 2009 and the production of their first solenoid valve in 2016.  Group structure  = Stihl Holding = The Zama group is part of the Stihl Holding AG & Co. KG which is headquartered in Waiblingen, Germany. The Zama factories are subsidiaries owned 100% by the Stihl International GmbH. = Locations of Zama group and tasks = Zama operates in five locations around the world. Zama Corporation in Hong Kong is the administrative, financial and logistic center of the Zama Group, and distributes more than 14 million carburetors worldwide, making use of the excellent logistic and financial facilities in Hong Kong. Zama Precision Industries (Huizhou) Corporation Ltd. in Guangdong, China serves as the production location of Zama Group. Approximately 1,600 associates produce electronic fuel injection systems, carburetors, oil pumps, solenoid-valves and other parts for the outdoor industry. Zama Japan is the center of Research and Development, design of in-house production tooling, as well as support for Japanese domestic customers. Zama Philippines, the newest Zama plant, is producing carburetors and miniaturized coils for solenoid valves. USA Zama, Inc, located in Franklin, Tennessee serves as the Sales headquarters for the Zama Group and the world headquarters for Zama Aftermarket Sales.  Products and customers  Zama offers about 350 different models of diaphragm carburetors and is a major manufacturer of lubricating systems for chainsaws. Other products Zama sells include electronic fuel injection systems, solenoid valves, output shafts, and complete solutions for fuel management as well as other customer-specific parts. Together with their partners, they offer complete engine management systems for small 2 and 4 cycle engines. OEM customers, such as Stihl, Husqvarna or Yamabiko, are mainly producers of lawn and garden products.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Thirteen (VP-213) on 1 October 1943, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Thirteen (VPB-213) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 10 July 1945. Operational history *1 October‚ÄìNovember 1943: VP-213, a medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3S Mariner, was established at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, under the operational control of FAW-5. Training for squadron personnel commenced on 2 October 1944 at NAAS Harvey Point, North Carolina, and continued through the end of November. Twenty-eight of the assigned pilots were PBM qualified when reporting aboard. These officers assisted in training the remaining 15 new pilots by distributing them among the more experienced crews. *12 December 1943: The squadron‚Äôs first operational loss occurred during a night training flight with a crew of 12 enlisted and four officers aboard. The aircraft, piloted by Lieutenant (jg) Lincoln G. Nordby, vanished without a trace, despite the efforts of 21 aircraft searching the sector over a two-day period. All hands were presumed lost. *18 December 1943: VPB-213 was transferred to NAS Key West, Florida, under the operational control of FAW-12 and brought to operational status with Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) patrols and coverage of the convoy lanes off the East Coast. *1 January 1944: The squadron was transferred to Nassau, Bahamas, for advanced base operations with tender support provided by . On 12 February a detachment was sent to NAAS Great Exuma, British West Indies, for night patrols due to inadequate lighting facilities at Nassau. *26 January 1944: The squadron suffered another night operational loss when aircraft P-3, flown by Lieutenant (jg) B. C. Herod, landed in an ammunition dump on Fleming Key, NAS Key West. The flight crew was using a flashlight to illuminate the instrument panel after the panel lights failed. The resulting glare blinded the pilots, who mistook the perimeter lights of the ammunition dump for the landing lights of the bay. Two officers and nine enlisted personnel were killed in the resulting explosion. *13 March 1944: The squadron came close to losing another aircraft while making an approach to NAS Key West in daylight. An Army anti aircraft battery was practicing with live ammunition at nearby Fort Taylor. One 37-mm shell penetrated aircraft P-11, flown by Ensign J. B. Clausen, removing the foot of AOM3c Morris. The Army officer in charge was subsequently tried by general court martial. *1 May 1944: VP-213 departed Nassau, Bahamas, for NAF Grand Cayman Island, British West Indies A detachment was maintained at Royal Island, British West Indies, aboard USS Christiana. *13 Sep 1944: A VPB-213 aircraft was sent out to locate as a hurricane moved towards the Bahaman Islands. The destroyer was spotted on radar but could not be reached due to the intensity of the storm. Water had entered her vents during the night causing power loss and electrical failure. The crew abandoned ship at 12:50 after fruitless attempts to save her and she went down almost immediately. Surface craft in the area were able to rescue only five officers and 68 enlisted personnel out of a complement of 321. *5 October 1944: The squadron complement of aircraft was reduced from 12 to 9. The extra aircraft and flight crews were transferred to VPB-99 at NAS Corpus Christi, Texas. *1‚Äì11 November 1944: The squadron was returned to NAS Key West, with eight aircraft and one on detached duty to Eleuthera Island, British West Indies. On 4 November, six aircraft were detached to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, for temporary duty with Naval Air Task Unit, Quonset, returning on the 11th. *20 November 1944: VPB-213 was deployed to NAS Trinidad, British West Indies, coming under the operational control of FAW-11. The squadron provided convoy coverage from Trinidad to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a detachment of aircraft at NAF Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana. The detachment was provided tender support by , based on the Surinam River. *27 January‚Äì7 February 1945: Detachments of five aircraft each participated in advanced base training with tender . *2 April‚ÄìJun 1945: A three-aircraft, four-crew detachment was sent to NS San Juan, Puerto Rico, to relieve VPB-212. After completing the deployment to San Juan, two of the aircraft returned to Trinidad, to rejoin the squadron and the other plane was turned over to HEDRON-11 at NS San Juan. With the cessation of hostilities in Europe on 8 May, the duties of the squadron were reduced to training and ferrying of supplies and personnel between Trinidad and San Juan. On 27 June orders were received to turn in all aircraft to HEDRON-11 at NS San Juan. This was accomplished and all squadron personnel were loaded aboard for transportation to NAS Norfolk. *10 July 1945: VPB-213 was disestablished at NAS Norfolk.

He was appointed as Minister of Health in October 2012 after serving as State Minister in charge of Health Programs from 2010 to October 2012. He is known for his critical role in implementing the health sector reform of the country when he served as Director General, Health Promotion and Disease Prevention between 2007 and 2010. Dr Kesete has been appointed as Chief Executive Officer of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria in February-2017. Early life and education Kesete was born and raised in Addis Ababa, in a neighborhood called Cherkos. He attended Felege Yordanos Primary School and Abyot Kirs (aka GCA) secondary school. He was trained in the University of Gondar College of Medical Sciences for both his Doctor of Medicine and Master of Public Health degrees. Career =Key achievements= Dr Kesete is a champion of innovation, task-shifting, and implementation at large scale. He has been a staunch advocate for maternal health and child health and led the national roll-out of a single rod contraceptive implant through the use of community health workers that resulted in 2 million women using the method. He also coordinated the national scale up of integrated community case management of childhood illnesses to improve access to life saving interventions. These efforts led to the reduction of child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 and help Ethiopia to achieve the Millennium Development Goals targets.https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/2015_MDG_Report/pdf/MDG%202015%20rev%20(July%201).pdf He has led the implementation of the reformed family code that helped reduce clandestine abortion and its contribution to high maternal mortality and played a pivotal role in abolishing user fees and provision of free maternal services in all public health facilities. He was nominated by Melinda Gates for the 2016 Global 120 under 40 Leaders of Family Planning award http://120under40.org/ Minister Kesete is a globally recognized leader in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. He was the architect of the Addis Ababa commitment on NTDs, which has been endorsed by more than 26 countries. Under his leadership, Ethiopia has developed a national roadmap to end the scourge of NTDs by 2020. He is particularly known for the Ministerial Initiative he has launched to reduce the surgical backlog of patients with trachoma. The overarching aim of his initiative is to end blinding trachoma in Ethiopia by 2020. Through this ministerial initiative, in less than two years nearly 300,000 patients have already undergone TT surgery and averted avoidable blindness. Under the leadership of Admasu, Ethiopia made huge strides in improving availability of safe blood. In 2012, the amount of blood collected was about 50, 000 units, in which only 27% were collected from voluntary donors and the rest from family replacements. This has increased to nearly 140,000 units and 97% of the blood is collected from voluntary donors. The establishment of the National Blood Bank and Transfusion Services by council of Ministers regulation in 2013 provided the platform for the transition of the blood transfusion service from Ethiopian Red Cross Society to the Ministry of Health. Minister Kesete's close follow up is credited for smooth transition and big improvement in voluntary blood collection.http://www.moh.gov.et/documents/26765/0/HEALTH+SECTOR+TRANSFORMATION+PLAN-I+ANNUAL+PERFORMANCE+REPORT+%28ARM_2016%29/477756e2-1e27-49bb-b378-578d2e27210b?version=1.0 Dr Kesete realized his vision of establishing an international institute for primary healthcare in Ethiopia which is closely linked to the famous health extension program. The institute was officially launched in January 2016 and has the mission of providing training in primary healthcare, grounded in exposure to fieldwork, and dedicated to expanding and strengthening of PHC programs at scale throughout Africa and beyond. The international institute will collaborate with the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and is based within the Ethiopian Public Health Institute in Addis Ababa. The International Institute for PHC will assist other countries in the design and implementation of PHC programs at scale, aiming to accelerate the improvement of the health of populations in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXtBkTMHviU Minister Kesete is known for championing and introducing innovations to improve the quality and equity of health services. The Clean and Safe Health Facility (CASH) initiative, with the objective of making health facilities safe and comfortable for patients, attendants and health workers, has been launched by him.http://www.washinhcf.org/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/Ethiopia_CASH.pdf CASH is transforming hospitals across the country. Another notable innovation Dr Kesete has championed is the guidance and scaling up of an Audit-able Pharmaceutical Transaction Service (APTS), which is a local innovation, started in Debre Markos Referral Hospital and grown in Axum St Mary Hospital and in other hospitals of the country. APTS is a data driven package of interventions designed to transform the pharmaceutical supply chain in general and pharmacy services at health facilities. The system improves patient knowledge on correct dosage, decrease waiting time and increase care time. It establish accountable, transparent and responsible supply chain and pharmacy practices enabling the Audit Bureau and regulatory authority to easily audit, trace and control products from theft, pilferage and illegal diversion. It helps supply chain organizations and health facilities to optimize utilization of medicines budget, improve access to affordable medicines, and decrease wastage. APTS standardizes and continuously monitors the number, mix & performance of supply and pharmacy service workforce. It also standardizes customer service premise design and workflow.https://www.chemonics.com/impact- story/attention-to-detail/ Through improving recording and documentation, it generates reliable and consistent information for decision making and control for regulatory authority. As a result, APTS improves overall quality of the supply chain and pharmacy services thereby increasing patient knowledge on correct dosage and satisfaction for customers. APTS improves quality of pharmaceutical services, brings transparency, accountability and efficiency in health facilities through effective recording and reliable information. Ultimately it contributes to better health outcomes.http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/documents/s21704en/s21704en.pdf from 2011 to June 2019, more than 200 health facilities have implemented APTS with dramatic improvement in availability of medicines and reduced wastage. During the inception of APTS, Dr Kesete and creator of APTS,http://msh-medicine- movers.org/#introduction discussed on the issue while they were in Adama for workshop developing manuals of ‚Äúcode of Ethics‚Äù for various health professions in Ethiopia. They discussed on the content of APTS, advantages and how to implement the system and Dr Kesete advised the creator on how to go about it and what should it focus. Dr Kesete decided to implement it at Amanuel Hospital and to transfer the creator from ALERT hospital to Amanuel Hospital, since he was the then CEO of the Amanuel hospital. But fortunately, soon he was promoted to be the health minister of the country so that he got opportunity to implement it nationally. He was leading implementation of the new system-APTS nationally, monitoring every month with very detailed knowledge of APTS. The new system, APTS, is incorporated in a level four pharmacy pre-service training curriculum in Ethiopia with significant credit hours. APTS is also included in the graduate level (master's degree) training of pharmacy management in Wollo University. The principles of APTS have potential to be scaled up to and beyond Ethiopia - globally both for pharmacy services and supply chain. Generally, Dr Kesete led and contributed a lot for the innovation, development and scale up of APTS.https://www.frontlinehealthworkers.org/how-one-pharmacist-can-make-a- difference-transforming-ethiopias-pharmaceutical-sector/ Dr Kesete has also demonstrated strong leadership to improve emergency medical system in Ethiopia by prioritizing human resource development, procurement of ambulances, training of EMTs, reforming the emergency departments, availing medical equipment to strengthen and establish ICUs, and instituting emergency coordination team.http://www.moh.gov.et/documents/26765/0/Emergency+Medical+Services/bfbb5bff-f040-4267-96e8-12253f96880f?version=1.0 These intervention has tremendously improved access to emergency care across Ethiopia. Before rejoining the Ministry of Health Dr Kesete served as Chief Executive Officer of Amanuel Hospital-the only mental health hospital in the country- and played critical role in turning around the performance of the hospital into one of the best hospitals in the country. He has also decentralized mental health services into primary care and initiated and coordinated psychiatric training for nurses and clinical offices that has addressed the critical shortage of health workers in the field. Dr Kesete has changed the course of mental health for the better in Ethiopia. The BSc level pre-service training program is now running in 5 universities and produce up to 400 mental health practitioners who are deployed to primary and secondary care level. The MSc training in clinical and community psychiatry is also producing up to 30 graduates every year who are serving as Non-Physician Psychiatrists. For these and other initiatives that brought substantial change in mental health, Dr Kesete has been recognized by Ethiopian Psychiatric Association as outstanding leader in Mental Health in 2016. He also served the Ministry as Team Leader of Public Private Partnership and led the formation of partnership forums with health professional associations, civil society and the private sector. =International experience= Dr Kesete is a prominent figure in global health. He is a leader in promoting primary health care and serves in a number of international advisory panels, which aims to promote CHWs. He was appointed to the Every Woman Every Child steering group by the UNSG that developed the EWEC strategy 1.0. He has also championed the promise renewed movement to end preventable child deaths by 2030.https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1860/Remarks%20Dr.Kesete%20Child%20Survival%2001-16-12.pdf As a result, he successfully co-hosted a global call to action conferences in DC, Delhi and Addis, that mobilized global support to reposition child health in the context of SDG. He has also served in the FP2020 reference group. Dr Kesete played a critical role in shaping up the Global Financing Facility for RMNCHA + N as he has been a member of the design group.https://www.un.org/esa/ffd/ffd3/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/07/EWEC- GFF-press-release-FINAL-July-13-2015.pdf He has been serving as a member of 'Investor Group' of the GFF.

History Marjorie was born in 1916 the only daughter of William James Fisher and Mary Marguerita Fisher, n√©e Bath, of Brougham Place, Alberton. She was educated at Presbyterian Girls' College, where she studied art with Maude Priest.Curriculum Vitae: Marjorie Hann, OAM, FRSASA She joined the Royal South Australian Society of Arts as an Associate at age 15, and in the early 1930s studied oil painting under Leslie Wilkie, Gladys Goode and Ivor Hele at the South Australian School of Arts and Crafts in the Exhibition Building on North Terrace. Leaving school, she worked as a commercial artist for several companies before landing a full-time position with Waterman Brothers, home furnishers of Port Road, Kilkenny, which largely entailed designing and executing showcards and other advertising work. She was active in amateur theatricals: acting, writing and set and costume design for the Playbox Theatre. She co-wrote a musical comedy \\"His Royal Highness\\" in 1938. During World War II she left Watermans to work at the Holden factory in Woodville, working on technical drawings and instruction documents as part of the \\"war effort\\". This put a great strain on her mentally, and she did not look on this period with any feelings of nostalgia. =Cartooning= After the war Marjorie illustrated a series of books for children by Kathleen M. Mellor MBE, the first Director of the Lady Gowrie Child Centre. These were a book on safety entitled \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\", and another pair entitled \\"Now I'm Ready\\" and \\"Let's Go to the Beach\\". In 1947 radio personality Bob Fricker created a comic character \\"Charlie Cheesecake\\", a boy who was always getting into trouble, for his breakfast programme on 5AD.He did not create the name; it had been used in the early 1940s by an Australian \\"blue\\" vaudeville team for an entirely different character, \\"Charlie Cheesecake the \\"Minister for Misinformation\\". and was approached by the Child Safety Council of SA to write and illustrate a similar booklet of \\"cautionary tale\\" poems, in collaboration with advertising executive Lloyd A. Wilson (1898‚Äì1961). \\"The Adventures of Charlie Cheesecake\\" was published around 1950. Two illustrations, drawn in comic strip style, were given for each predicament, the somewhat gruesome \\"after\\" being revealed by lifting a flap. A follow-up \\"The Return of Charlie Cheesecake\\" was published many years later, sponsored by Geo. Hall & Sons and Radio 5AD.Marjorie Hann, and Child and Home Safety Committee of South Australia & Road Safety Council of South Australia 1960, The Return of Charlie Cheesecake, Griffin Press, Adelaide. No date is available for this title, but internal evidence (drawings of a transistor radio, Morris Mini Minor) puts its publication date around 1962. She wrote and illustrated a serious comic strip adaptation of Thackeray's The Rose and the Ring which was serialized in 82 episodes and syndicated throughout Australia. =Writing and art criticism= Marjorie had demonstrated her ability to write for newspapers in a variety of assignments. After contributing the winning essay for a contest \\"What I hate about housework\\", she was given a column \\"Every Woman's Family\\", which she wrote (as \\"Helen\\") for the Adelaide News and the Melbourne Argus, or/then the Sunday Advertiser for many years. She was asked by the Messenger Press to write a regular column on regional art exhibitions for their free suburban newspapers. She filled the role for four years, during which time she attended classes on the History of Art. She acted as judge for the art division of the Royal Adelaide Show for eleven years. She wrote and illustrated several historical articles for The Advertiser. =Teaching= She taught landscape and portrait painting and art appreciation classes at the Workers' Educational Association for 16 years, and life classes at the Kensington and Norwood Colleges of TAFE for four years. She conducted many art classes in country regions throughout South Australia, in Mildura, New South Wales, and in Nambour, Queensland. In 1973 she instigated tutorials for artists, with ten established South Australian practitioners leading the classes. She coordinated the programme, in conjunction with the Royal South Australian Society of Arts, for nine years. =Painting= She has always painted in a realistic style directly from nature, from live models and subjects sitting for commissioned portraits, or en plein aire. She has worked in pastels and oils, but her favorite medium has always been watercolors. She acknowledged Gladys Goode, Ivor Hele and John C. Goodchild as her chief influences. She had two six-month painting trips to the United Kingdom, in 1976 and 1979, each followed by a highly successful solo exhibition at the gallery of the Royal South Australian Society of Arts, and a solo exhibition at the Adelaide Art Society in 2009. She had a long association with the Lombard Art Gallery of North Adelaide and Stepney, including six Adelaide Fringe Festival Exhibitions. She also exhibited regularly at the Pepper Street Gallery in Magill, and at various Adelaide Art Society functions. Family She married Sergeant George Adrian Hann (4 April 1916 ‚Äì 1991) of the RAAF sometime around 1945. He was a son of George Hann (1869‚Äì1933) and his second wife Mabel Hann n√©e Hoffman of Kooringa, South Australia. George and Marjorie had a home at 10 Taylor Terrace, Rosslyn Park.

This hospital is managed by the Southern Railway zone's Tiruchirappalli railway division. It serves active and retired Indian Railway employees and their families.  History  The hospital is located amidst the Railway Quarters in Golden Rock, near the Golden Rock Railway Workshop and Golden Rock Shandy. Established in 1927 by the erstwhile South Indian Railway Company, it is the oldest hospital in the Southern Railway zone older than the Zonal hospital at Perambur, which was constructed in 1928. It is part of Indian Railway Medical Services, which maintains a large network of hospitals 56 divisional and 9 zonal.  Administration  The personnel health care in Indian Railways is managed by the Director General of Railway Health Services under the Railway Health Directorate, an apex body at the Railway Board. The Chief Medical Director of the Southern Railway zone oversees the health affairs at the zonal level, under which five divisional hospitals function at Arakkonam, Madurai, Palakkad, Thiruvananthapuram, and Golden Rock, headed by Chief Medical Superintendents.

The squadron was established as Patrol Squadron Two Hundred Sixteen (VP-216) on 15 November 1943, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron Two Hundred Sixteen (VPB-216) on 1 October 1944 and disestablished on 7 April 1945. Operational history *15 November 1943 ‚Äì 26 February 1944: VP-216 was established at NAAS Harvey Point, North Carolina, as medium seaplane squadron flying the PBM-3S Mariner, under the operational control of FAW-5. From 5 December 1943 to 24 January 1944 intensive ground and flight training was conducted. Upon completion of the syllabus, the squadron was equipped with new PBM-3D Mariner. Almost immediately, problems began to appear with the valve inserts in the Wright R2600-22 engines of the Mariners, resulting in grounding of all squadron aircraft through 26 February 1944. These problems were not completely resolved until late May. *2‚Äì23 March 1944: Twelve squadron aircraft were transferred to NAS Key West, Florida, for intensive shakedown training in Anti-submarine warfare (ASW), glide bombing and use of radar in bombing. *24 March 1944: VP-216 transferred aircraft and personnel in three-aircraft elements to NAS Alameda, California, via MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas, and NAS San Diego, California. ‚ÄúHow goes it‚Äù curves were developed on each aircraft, enabling the crew to determine each individual aircraft‚Äôs capabilities for the forthcoming trans-Pacific flight to Hawaii. The curve was a plot of speed, distance, engine settings, remaining fuel, etc., that assisted the crew in assessing the crucial ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù for the over-water transit to NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. *29 March ‚Äì 1 April 1944: Ten of the squadron‚Äôs 15 aircraft were able to complete the trans-Pacific flight from NAS Alameda to NAS Kaneohe Bay, coming under the operational control of FAW-2. Three required engine replacements at the MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake, refueling point and two needed major repairs upon arrival at NAS Alameda. These five aircraft rejoined the squadron at NAS Kaneohe Bay on 30 April. *1 April ‚Äì 23 June 1944: The next three months were spent at NAS Kaneohe Bay undergoing intensive combat training and repairs to the erratic engines. During this period the squadron conducted sector patrols, made final equipment check runs and conducted bomb- dropping and gunnery exercises on a daily basis. Deficiencies in crew member training were eliminated by proficiency checks and refresher courses. *28 May 1944: 12 officers and 42 men departed aboard for Saipan, Marianas Island. *23 June 1944: VP-216 deployed to Saipan, anchoring in Tanapag Harbor, under the operational control of FAW-2. USS Chandeleur provided berthing and maintenance support for the squadron during this period. Primary duties involved day and night reconnaissance patrols for Fifth Fleet operations. During the period through 10 August the squadron attacked and damaged three Japanese cargo vessels. Although numerous enemy aircraft were spotted, none could be attacked successfully due to the slower speed of the Mariner. *31 July 1944: A VP-216 Mariner flown by Lieutenant Richard P. Gavin developed engine problems and landed at sea, damaging a wingtip float in the process. No injuries to the crew were incurred and 24 hours later ships of TF-51 rescued the crew. The aircraft, which could not be salvaged or towed due to the damage, provided useful target practice to the destroyers on the scene. *10 July ‚Äì 10 September 1944: By this date, enemy snipers and scavengers had been largely eliminated ashore on Saipan. VP-216 began using the Japanese-constructed seaplane ramp at Tanapag Harbor to permit on-shore maintenance and crew rest on dry land. Armed guards were posted and assisted in the capture or killing of over 20 Japanese soldiers in their perimeter. Throughout August the tempo of operations decreased and the squadron was put on standby for redeployment to the Palau Islands group. *10 September 1944: The first three-aircraft element of VP-216 was transferred to Kossol Passage, Palau, under the operational command of FAW-1. At 04:00 the next day, the squadron received a sharp lesson on watch tending when a group of Japanese boarded an adjacent PB2Y-3 Coronado in the anchorage, blowing up the aircraft and killing themselves in the process. The remainder of the squadron arrived at Kossol Passage by 17 September. USS Chandeleur and provided seaplane tender services at Kossol Passage. Operations at Kossol Passage were the same as at Saipan, providing coverage for the Third Fleet under Admiral Halsey. *6 October 1944: Lieutenant Arthur W. Doherty encountered typhoon weather while returning from a night patrol. With his radio direction-finder gear and radar inoperative, Lieutenant Doherty managed to establish his position and began a correct heading towards base. On the morning of 7 October, approximately from base, the Mariner ran out of gas, forcing Lieutenant Doherty to attempt a stall landing. In the process a wing was torn off and 9 crewmembers escaped the wreckage. One officer and two enlisted men were lost in the accident. *18 November 1944: The first three- aircraft element of VPB-216 left Kossol Passage for return to NAS Kaneohe Bay, en route to NAS San Diego. *7 April 1945: VPB-216 was disestablished.

Invested as a puppet ruler by the Ottomans in 1545, Kaikhosro II's tenure was marred by incessant Iranian‚ÄìOttoman rivalry, as well as uneasy relations with neighboring Georgian polities, and internecine feuds. The western part of his principality became quickly assimilated by the Ottomans and formed into a pa≈üalƒ±k, while the eastern part came under Iranian suzerainty. In 1570, as a result of continued Ottoman aggression, Kaikhosro was forced to seek direct assistance from his suzerain king Tahmasp I (r. 1524‚Äì1576) at the Iranian royal court, where he died three years later as well. Biography During the first decades of the 16th century, which were marked by political turmoil, the Samtskhe lords found themselves dispossessed of their territories. Kaikhosro, then still an infant, was smuggled by Otar Shalikashvili to the Ottoman court at Istanbul in order to request help to reclaim his principality. In 1536, the Ottoman army came, did nothing to help reinstate the atabeg, but went back with more loot than they could carry. Subsequently, Samtskhe ceased to exist for a period of ten years ‚Äî all of its lands were divided between Rostom Gurieli, Bagrat III of Imereti, and Luarsab I of Kartli. At the same time, the Ottomans pursued an active policy of Islamisation in the southwest. In 1545, during the Ottoman- Safavid War of 1532-155, Samtskhe was under the attack of the main army of then incumbent Ottoman ruler Suleiman the Magnificent (r. 1520‚Äì1566). Eventually, the Ottomans, assisted by Otar Shalikashvili, managed to overrun Samtskhe; Kaikhosro II was subsequently invested as a puppet atabeg by the Ottomans. In the same year, Kaikhosro (then aged 22) married Dedisimedi, a Georgian noblewoman of the House of Mukhrani. Ottoman aggression in Samtskhe alarmed Kaikhosro II; he subsequently appealed to then incumbent Iranian Safavid king Tahmasp I to drive the Ottomans off, and to assist him in regaining Javakheti (ever since the Samtskhe principality was disbanded, it had fallen under the rule of Luarsab I). In January 1547, Tahmasp I occupied the town of Akhalkalaki, despite a \\"severe winter\\", followed shortly by Javakheti and Lower Kartli. The Iranian army, however, was \\"decimated\\" by Luarsab I's mercenaries, and shortly after by those of Bagrat III of Imereti and Levan of Kakheti (who helped Luarsab I). Eventually though, both Bagrat III and Levan were paid off by Tahmasp I. Later in 1547, when the Ottoman threat flared up again, Tahmasp I summoned the kings of Imereti and Kakheti in order to secure tribute and military support from them. Kaikhosro II ended up watching the western part of his principality being assimilated by the Ottomans and formed into a pa≈üalƒ±k, while the eastern moiety‚Äîwhere he preferred to stay‚Äîbeing subjected to Iran. The Ottomans would later periodically raid this eastern part of Samtskhe, which was under Iranian suzerainty; as a result, they managed to drive Kaikhosro in 1570 to the Iranian royal court at Qazvin, where he begged then incumbent king Tahmasp I to intervene. Kaikhosro II died three years later, in 1573, at Qazvin. He was succeeded by the eldest of his eight children with Dedisimedi, known by his dynastic name of Qvarqvare IV. However, since he was still young and inexperienced, the actual government of the country was taken over by his widow Dedisimedi and the nobleman Varaza Shalikashvili, whose sister was a favorite wife in king Tahmasp I's harem.  Children  Kaikhosro II had eight children with Dedisimedi: * Qvarqvare IV * Manuchar II * Beka III (converted to Islam and was named Sefer Pasha) * Ivane the Fair-Eyed (tvalmshvenieri) * Basil * Mzetchabuk * Elene * Tamar References Sources  1573 deaths Atabegs of Samtskhe 16th-century people from Georgia (country) Georgians of the Ottoman Empire 16th- century people of the Safavid Empire Iranian people of Georgian descent Kaikhosro Ottoman governors of Georgia Safavid appointed rulers of Samtskhe ","title":"Kaikhosro II Jaqeli"},{"id":"51515939","text":"Caged No More is a 2016 American drama film directed by Lisa Arnold and written by Lisa Arnold and Molly Venzke.

Han Yerry was born into his mother's Wolf clan, as the Iroquois had a matrilineal society with women holding property and hereditary leadership passing through their lines, children took the nationality and clan of their mother, as they gain social status through her. He became a war chief of the Oneida people and was key during the American Revolutionary War, considered to be one of the most influential leader of the Oneida. Yerry fought in the Battle of Oriskany against Loyalists and other members of the Haudenosaunee. He was married to Tyonajanegen.  Nomenclature  Han Yerry was thought to have had a German Palatine father. Although this statement is most likely a result of confusion with another family of \\"Dockstaders\\" that can trace their line back to Georg Dachst√§dter, a German Palatine who settled in Upstate New York in 1709. Han Yerry is not in his line and therefore his children most likely adopted the name.https://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/dockstader/58/ There are also unclear references in documents of the period to a Wolf Clan title Otatshehte, or \\"Carries a Quiver\\". It is possible that the surname Dachst√§dter could have developed as an Anglicization of this title.

Bradley gained fame in 2013 as a contestant on season eight of America's Got Talent, during which she advanced to the finals by performing her arrangements of popular songs including \\"Believe\\". Bradley finished the season in sixth place. Prior to her appearance on Americas Got Talent, Bradley won a local singing competition in Spokane in 2006. She self-released two solo projects in 2009 and a third in 2013. Following her national exposure, Bradley and Alabama singer-songwriter Whitney Dean formed a collaboration called the Sweeplings. She formed a second collaboration in 2019, Carmen Jane, to pursue a more experimental sound. The Sweeplings have released numerous works including the full-length album Rise & Fall (2015); songs including \\"Carry Me Home\\" have since been used in television series and promotional videos. Bradley and Dean joined Nettwerk in 2017 for their third EP, Sleepwalking, and a deluxe version of Rise & Fall. A full-length album scheduled for 2018 was scrapped; after a seven-month break, Bradley and Dean released the EP Losing Ground Vol. 1 in March 2020. Background Carmen Jane Miller was born in Spokane, Washington, into a musical family. Her father, Paul Miller, was the worship leader at the family's church; he was practicing vocal scales in the car while on the way to perform services when four-year-old Cami started singing along. Her mother, Amy Miller, said that was when they knew she had both singing talent and an ear for music. Cami Miller began learning the piano by age seven, and started writing songs at ten, though she later called those efforts terrible.Weinbender, \\"After incredible run ...\\". \\"[Bradley:] I have notebooks of old songs that are just terrible, but you have to start somewhere. I can definitely see the phases of life that I was in. When you‚Äôre really young, you write about things that you see, and when you get older, you write about things that you feel. So I can see the progression of who I was as a person.\\" Her early style was influenced by a wide range of music, including artists Christina Aguilera and Natalie Cole, and soundtracks to Disney films. Miller began performing her songs during her teen years; the week before she turned 18, she won a car by finishing first in the Spring 2006 season of the local Gimme the MIKE competition. When it was suggested that she should try out for national, televised singing competitions like The Voice, she declined because she did not find the idea to be appealing. Miller married Eric Bradley on August 25, 2006. Career =2009: Anomalous and Unhinged= Cami Bradley's first recording effort was the full-length album Anomalous, released in April 2009 and featuring 12 songs. Bradley later said she was happy with the album, but it did not really represent her because she was still trying to find her artistic voice. In June 2009, she released the four-song EP Unhinged, including a medley of the traditional hymns \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"'Tis So Sweet\\". =2013: Seas and America's Got Talent= Bradley self-released her second full-length album Seas in May 2013, featuring her husband Eric on drums. A Kickstarter campaign in April to fund the album's release concert raised nearly $4,000. Seas comprises seven songs including \\"This Ocean\\", a duet with her younger brother Ryan Miller, one-half of the indie duo the Rustics. For this album, Bradley said she wrote emotional stories based on the experiences of people close to her, to create \\"a picture of what I see other people feeling.\\" Early in 2013, Bradley got a telephone call from a scout with America's Got Talent suggesting that she send them a video of her performing. The producers then sent her to audition in Chicago, where she began to have second thoughts.Weinbender, \\"After incredible run ...\\". \\"[Bradley:] I was like, 'What am I doing here? This is an awful idea. Why did I say yes to this?' But I kind of think it was a blessing for me. I may have been really intimidated, if I had walked into a room of singers.\\" She sang an a cappella version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\", prompting the judges to put her through to the Las Vegas round; there, she performed \\"Summertime\\" and advanced to the live shows. Bradley's televised appearance during the Las Vegas episode was brief;Weinbender, \\"After incredible run ...\\". \\"[Bradley:] As we were watching the show, I thought, 'Oh man, they didn't show me at all. How am I going to get votes? it was her quarterfinals performance that propelled her into the national spotlight. Bradley accompanied herself on piano in a stripped-down performance of \\"Believe\\", earning praise from the judges. Mel B lauded the brave arrangement and suggested that Cher might consider a similar approach. Howard Stern agreed, and said it was like hearing the lyrics and their meaning for the first time. Howie Mandel said Bradley had a haunting style and a \\"star quality... that could possibly take her all the way.\\" Bradley continued into the finals of the competition with rearranged versions of pop songs including \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\" and \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\". Her sixth-place finish left her happy and newly confident, having been given the opportunity to \\"get out of my comfort zone.\\" After America's Got Talent wrapped, Bradley joined her fellow finalists on a two-month tour. She appeared on FORTE's debut album as the featured guest on \\"The Prayer\\", and performed the song live with FORTE at Carnegie Hall. =2014‚Äìpresent= The Sweeplings The Sweeplings (l‚Äìr): Whitney Dean and Cami Bradley Singer- songwriter Whitney Dean was working on his music while at home in Huntsville, Alabama, when his wife suggested that they watch Bradley perform on America's Got Talent. Afterward, Bethany Dean said her husband and Bradley should write music together.Johnson, \\"Crossing Lines\\". \\"[Whitney Dean:] I told [Bethany], 'Good luck with that.' I told her she could reach out to Cami if she wanted, but it wasn't going to be me.\\" Bradley declined on first contact, but Bethany persisted; Whitney Dean and Bradley began collaborating via Skype a few months later. In April 2014, the Deans were invited by the Bradleys to visit their home in Spokane, Washington, and the meeting was both pleasant and productive. Within their first weekend, Cami Bradley and Whitney Dean had co-written eight songs. A self-titled, four-song EP was released in September 2014, but the new duo did little promotion at first, because Bradley did not want her fans to be confused if the pairing did not work out; Bradley also wanted to make clear that she and Dean were not a romantic couple. Instead, she released videos of cover songs as a solo artist so people would not forget about her. In August 2015, the Sweeplings released their debut album, Rise & Fall, on their own label. NPR had premiered the song \\"Carry Me Home\\" the month before, and iTunes later placed the song on its list of the 25 best singer-songwriter tracks of 2015. In February 2016, Billboard premiered the video for \\"Under Your Spell\\", a song about the struggle with life choices. Albums to follow included Covers, Ch. 1; the EP Winter's Call; a Christmas album, Merrier Days; a deluxe version of Rise & Fall; and the EP Sleepwalking. The duo had planned to release a full-length album via Nettwerk in 2018; after two weeks' work, Bradley said they had to stop. \\"Some tragedy, some loss, some internal struggle\\" led to difficulties in finding their vision, and they decided to take some time off. Seven months later, they chose to scale back to piano, guitar and vocals. Their EP Losing Ground Vol. 1 was released in March 2020, including seven songs. Bradley did not announce a date for Losing Ground Vol. 2, but said, \\"the material is ready\\". Also in 2020, The Sweeplings uploaded two music videos to their YouTube channel. \\"In Between\\" debuted on January 24; \\"Bleed Me White\\" was released with the EP on March 13. Dean and Eric Bradley were responsible for the concepts; Dean's wife Bethany shot the videos. \\"In Between\\" was co written by John Paul White. Carmen Jane In 2019, Bradley formed a second collaboration in addition to her music with the Sweeplings. Carmen Jane, after her given name, makes songs that Bradley calls \\"dark pop\\", a more experimental sound reminiscent of Billie Eilish. Bradley's collaborator in Germany is producer Nico Rebscher, and their work is \\"the first time I've felt fully me in music.\\" Carmen Jane is based in Los Angeles, where Bradley also travels to write music with her brother, Ryan. Critical reception Cami Bradley performing live with Whitney Dean (not pictured) at the Hotel Cafe in Hollywood in 2018. People magazine praised Bradley during her appearances on America's Got Talent. \\"There's something about this 25-year-old's voice that pulls you in as she takes on classic songs and makes them her own.\\" Of \\"Believe\\", entertainment editor Avery Thompson wrote, \\"with just a piano and her incredible voice, Cami stole the show and perhaps the competition.\\" A readers' poll conducted annually by Inlander named Bradley the Best Singer-Songwriter of 2015 and 2016. She placed second in the same poll in both 2017 and 2018. AllMusic wrote that songs composed by Bradley and Dean reveal \\"a penchant for haunting, tender harmonies and a roots-inspired sound that bears similarities to The Civil Wars.\\" PopDust rated Rise & Fall No. 15 on its list of best albums of 2015, on which \\"Dean and Bradley float across vast landscapes of dusty tones and shadowy figures.\\" The Birmingham News called it \\"an uncommonly focused, polished and big-stage-ready debut from an independent band\\". Elmore Magazine noted Bradley's \\"concise\\" chemistry with Dean. In its review of Sleepwalking, Atwood Magazine wrote, \\"Cami Bradley's breathtaking voice leads with pain and passion, charged with a poignant edge that is as biting as it is bitten.\\" Personal life Eric and Cami Bradley live in Spokane, Washington, and work at her father's church there. They bought a small second home in Huntsville, Alabama, to facilitate Cami's career with the Sweeplings; their home search was featured on a 2016 episode of Tiny House Hunting. Cami Bradley also is a professional photographer.

It was designed by Robin Dods and built by Gibbs Brothers of Charleville. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 December 2013.  History  Myendetta (1910), located south-west of Charleville, was designed by eminent architect Robert Smith (Robin) Dods for grazier Charles Decimus Edmund Francis. Pastoral settlement of the Warrego district in which Myendetta is located commenced in the early 1860s when large pastoral leases were taken up. Survey of the town of Charleville occurred in 1867 and Murweh Divisional Board was established in 1879. The town's growth and importance in the Warrego district increased when it served as the terminus of the Western railway line from 1888 until 1898, before the rail line was extended to Cunnamulla. The town developed as a major service centre for the surrounding pastoral industry and Cobb & Co established stables and a factory there for the construction of mail coaches. On 21 March 1894 the town of Charleville was proclaimed a separate municipality, the Borough of Charleville (from 1903, Town of Charleville). Charles Francis, born in 1860, was the youngest son of a prominent Cambridge legal family and was educated at Eton and Oxford. He migrated to South Australia following an elder brother and worked his way north to the Charleville area. The first evidence of Francis in the Charleville district is in September 1887 when two selections on the road from Charleville to Roma were transferred to him from Keyran Ryan. In 1890 Francis was the lessee of Portion 18v, parish of Dillalah, County of Palmer (later Burrandilla). In the ensuing years he aggregated a large grazing property by taking over the leases of surrounding blocks of land and selecting land. Over time he built up a holding of 10 contiguous blocks totalling almost which were bounded by the Warrego River at its conjunction with the Ward River on the east. The land was used for sheep and cattle raising. In 1901 Francis married Marian Anne Challacombe and a daughter and son were born in 1904 and 1907 respectively. He became a leading member of the community and served as a Justice of the Peace and Magistrate from . On the death of CDE Francis in 1929 the property passed to only son Clement Edmund Francis and remained in the family's ownership until 2010. Family lore tells that Francis received an inheritance of following his mother's death, which \\"enabled him to build something of quality\\". Circa 1906 Francis decided to build a new homestead on his large property, away from the flood-prone Warrego River, and chose Dods as the architect. To enable the new construction, a artesian bore was sunk in 1908 near the future homestead and around the same time a woolshed and shearers' quarters were erected. The reason for the selection of Dods as the architect for Myendetta is unknown. Francis would have been aware of Dods as he designed a homestead at nearby Augathella in 1903 and in 1906, as Anglican Diocesan architect, he designed the alterations to All Saints Church, Charleville, as well as the new church hall, built in 1910. Dods' working drawings for Myendetta date from March 1908. Dods (1868‚Äì1920) was a New Zealand-born architect who lived briefly in Britain before coming to Brisbane in the 1870s. He later trained as an architect in Scotland and England under a number of esteemed architects who were working in the Arts and Crafts idiom. His architectural career began in Edinburgh in 1886, articled with architects Hay & Henderson. He attended evening classes at the Edinburgh Architectural Association until 1890 and formed a lasting friendship with (Sir) Robert Lorimer (1864‚Äì1929), eminent Scottish architect and fellow proponent of Arts and Crafts. In 1890 Dods moved to London, where he worked with the Fortifications Branch of the War Office and in the office of notable architect (Sir) Aston Webb. In 1891 he was admitted to the Royal Institute of British Architects and travelled in Italy. In 1894 Dods visited his mother in Brisbane and while there won a competition for a nurses home at the Brisbane General Hospitall. He returned to Brisbane in 1896 and started in practice with architect Francis Hall as Hall & Dods. Dods has been acknowledged as \\"one of the most significant early 20th century Australian architects\\" and unique as a rare practitioner of the Arts and Crafts style in Queensland. Arts and Crafts was an international design movement flourishing between 1860 and 1910, its influence continued into the 1930s. It was led by artist and writer William Morris and architect Charles Voysey and was inspired by the writings of John Ruskin and Augustus Pugin. The style championed traditional craftsmanship using simple forms and often applied medieval, romantic or folk styles of decoration. Importantly, it valued local variations in traditions so that good design would have relevance within its context. Arts and Crafts architecture is characterised by solidity and heaviness through well-proportioned solid forms, wide porches and prominent steep roofs. The texture of ordinary materials is expressed in the detailing and building composition is asymmetrical. The practice of Hall & Dods was the most influential source of modern design in Brisbane, producing a wide range of accomplished buildings, and was credited with achieving an \\"architectural revolution\\" in Brisbane. Dods was responsible for most of the design within the firm, integrating contemporary British design philosophies with the traditions of Queensland housing and the requirements of a subtropical climate, and producing practical, attractive, and finely detailed houses. The partnership ended in 1913, when Dods left to practice in Sydney. Dods died prematurely in 1920. Dods' residential work employed local building techniques combined with a sophisticated discipline and a common-sense response to climate. Dods' houses were mostly built of timber with detailing that was a celebration of craftsmanship. The most noticeable characteristic of his Queensland houses (built between 1896 and 1917) was a general feeling of solidity and substance. This was the result of a number of design decisions including: designing a generous roof (often the largest element) continuous over the verandah and over a lower, rear washhouse. The roof was always simple in geometry and often finished with terracotta tiles, flat shingles or pan- and-tile profile, flat iron sheeting with a prominent rolled joint. Corrugated iron was only used where it was necessary to reduce the cost. Generally low- set, the houses often had an enclosed or screened understorey to give the house a visually solid base. Individual elements were oversized to appear substantial as if under heavy loads. Bold, dark, earthy colours, darkly stained timber, rough-sawn weatherboards with mitred corners, roughcast rendering and face brickwork in dark colours were used to give the house a weighty gravity. The building materials and finishes were chosen to allow the building to mellow over time, providing it with a well-established appearance. The house designs take a formalist approach to planning including formal entry halls and traditional planning arrangements. The plans were generated through a consideration of aspect, with living spaces well-oriented and internal layouts permitting cross ventilation. They are also notable for their informal spaces, a particular feature being the inclusion of generous verandah piazzas. The plans respond to the social needs of the clients in an honest and functional way. The houses were often provided with generous, considered service spaces including back halls and wash houses. The health and comfort of the occupants were major considerations. Ventilation devices included wide window and door openings, ventilated gables and ridges, and ventilation fleches. Piazzas were generous, allowing comfortably furnished, semi-outdoor living. Operable shading and enclosure of the piazza was sometimes achieved by adding timber vertical louvres above the verandah handrail, creating a room habitable in most weather. Interiors included fine decorative timber joinery and panelling. Fireplace surrounds and built-in cupboards were also a feature. The composition of facades and circulation routes are a more nuanced element of Dods' houses and highlights his originality and artistic skill. Facades often only implied symmetry. Entries were often off-centre or perpendicular, emphasised by wide and expressive entry stairs. Projecting bay windows and corner fireplaces were recurrent elements. Dods designed gardens as a setting for the house, a practice more common in Britain than in Queensland. They featured formal parterre gardens, terraces and walls, flower beds, tennis courts, hedges, topiaries, flowering ornamental trees, and geometric path and lawn layouts. Garden furniture and structures were designed including seats, pergolas, trellises, fences and gates. Myendetta is an example of the homesteads built by Queensland's most successful pastoralists. As funds became available over time, they built comfortable, architect-designed homes or extended their earlier homesteads into residences more befitting their status. Most of these grand homesteads were built in the prosperous settled districts of south-east Queensland - Darling Downs, Moreton and Wide Bay Burnett districts, where pastoralists held freehold title; relatively few were built in the far west where land was leasehold. Between 1901 and 1913 Dods designed and built six homesteads for rural properties - Langlo Downs, Augathella (1903, destroyed by fire); extension to Nindooinbah Homestead, Beaudesert (1908); Ringsfield, Nanango (1908); Wyambyn, Beaudesert () (1909); Myendetta, Charleville (1910); and Kengoon, Kalbar (1913). These were large dwellings that often formed the centre of groups of outbuildings. Their garden layouts were also an important feature. Rural homesteads built in Queensland in the early part of the 20th century were large homes, often on elevated (flood- free) sites with a scenic outlook, surrounded by gardens. As well as those listed above, Marshlands near Hivesville (1910) designed by Hall & Dods (but not believed to be Dods' design) was built during this period, as was Hidden Vale near Grandchester (Eaton & Bates, 1903). Myendetta was built by Gibbs Brothers, Charleville builders and contractors who also constructed the FDG Stanley-designed Charleville School of Arts. Myendetta Station's vegetation was mulga scrub, unsuitable as a building material, so all building materials had to be brought in. Weatherboards and framing were hardwood while the v-jointed walls, floors and ceilings were Hoop Pine. When completed in 1910 Myendetta was a \\"state of the art\\" home complete with electricity generated by its own generator powered by water flow from the artesian bore. Hydro- electricity powered by artesian flow was a new technology pioneered at Thargomindah in 1898 (the first town in Australia to have hydroelectric power). This preceded the electrification of Charleville by 13 years. The house was flyscreened and well ventilated. An outbuilding was equipped with a cold room, insulated with charcoal and sealed with a layer of cork then cooled by air forced through water-soaked hessian curtains by an electric fan. The house was approached from the west along a curve around the south to an entry porch on the south-east. It was rectangular in plan with a wide cruciform corridor separating four banks of rooms wide. The house accommodated a large dining room, sitting room, drawing room, sewing room, a master bedroom with ensuite bathroom, four other bedrooms, a second bathroom, and a school room. At the juncture of the cruciform hallways was a central octagonal hall with four semicircular archways, one over each of the corridors. A verandah encircled the house and was generally wide. It widened to to create piazzas in two locations: outside the sitting and dining rooms, and outside the school room. The entry projected to form an even larger verandah space, approximately wide. The house had few windows (only two fixed casements to the sitting room); rather, it had pairs of French doors with glazed fanlights and gauzed timber-framed flyscreen doors to the exterior. Linked by a covered verandah to the north-eastern end of the house was a semi-detached service wing that accommodated a kitchen, a wash house, and a servants' room or large store room. The wing had a north-western verandah approximately wide accessed from the large kitchen via French doors. The wash house was at ground level reached via a short stair. The wash house was open on one side to the yard. Six water tanks were located nearby. Early photographs show that the service wing was largely screened from the entrance view. In an almost featureless landscape, the roof, which was the largest element with a massive 40-degree pitch that flattened to 25 degrees over the verandah made a powerful visual statement. Under the roofing iron, the roof framing was sheeted with pine boards giving the structure great strength as well as a degree of insulation. The roof apex had a decorative ventilator and elsewhere the roof had ventilated ridges. The verandah posts and beams were oversized and held large brackets. The composition of large roof and oversized structural elements imbued a robust nature to the homestead. The verandahs were without balustrade, giving an air of relaxed habitation and a strong connection between the house and the landscape. The whole composition was further enhanced by the placement of water tanks on stands of varying height that were fed from either the bore or rainwater from the roof. Analysis of Myendetta reveals Dods' deft architectural response to the harsh, variable climate of Charleville, which is relatively dry and hot with large temperature variations annually and diurnally. The plan layout is determined by the position of the sun at the time of day that the room would be used. Used primarily in the morning, the school room and adjacent piazza are on the south-western corner of the building, away from the north-eastern, morning sun. Conversely, the dining room and adjacent piazza, primarily used in the evening, are on the north- eastern corner of the building away from the south-western afternoon sun. The entire main building is surrounded by a verandah, sheltering all external walls from the sun and the vast, ventilated roof space, almost twice the height of the interior rooms, provided a huge sun shield. The wide, straight halls funnelled breezes through the house. All rooms opened onto the hall on one side and the verandah on the other with doors and operable fanlights to allow access to any breeze regardless of its direction. Dods' colour scheme for the house was dramatic, consisting of large areas of dark, rich colours contrasted by feature elements in bright, light colours. The scheme also included sophisticated painting techniques and stencilling internally. Myendetta included other elements designed by Dods. To the north-east of the service wing was a small, detached building containing a dairy and butcher shop, to the south-west of the house was a grass tennis court, and to the south-east was a rose garden and orchard. Myendetta was altered very little after construction. After the bore ceased to flow in 1971 the power supply was replaced by a diesel generator and by 1976 power was obtained from the mains. Some time after 1950 the tennis court was moved from the south-western side of the house to the south-eastern, replacing the rose garden and citrus orchard. At the same time a timber-battened fern house was added between the house and the service wing. In 2002 early colour schemes were found to survive under the existing paint scheme. In 2003 Myendetta was open for tours displaying historic household items and explaining the history of the station. In 2007 the service wing was renovated, including the addition of reverse cycle air- conditioning. In 2010, the Australian Institute of Architects added Myendetta to its list of nationally significant 20th century architecture, namely the Institute's National Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture. It is one of sixteen 20th century residential places which form the Institute's nomination to the International Union of Architects' (UIA) World Register of Significant 20th Century Australian Architecture and to the Australian Government National Heritage List. The property was purchased by the current owner in 2010 and in 2013 the homestead is used as a manager's residence.  Description  Myendetta Homestead is a substantial timber homestead on a large property () of flat, lightly wooded land, south-west of Charleville. The house sits within the remnants of a house garden that in 2013 is defined by a lawn. The front of the house faces south-east onto a flat grassed area, once a tennis court. It is a single-storeyed, low-set timber- framed building with an encircling verandah and a semi-detached service wing to the north. The house has a very large, steep hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets, a ventilated ridge cap, and a decorative ventilating fleche. Under the roof cladding is a layer of insulating timber boards. The roof is continuous over the verandahs but at a shallower pitch. The verandahs are without balustrade and the rectangular timber verandah posts are turned on their side to present the larger dimension to the elevation, thereby creating a robust visual impression with the posts supporting overscaled brackets. The verandah walls are single-skin, v-jointed boards with exposed, stop-chamfered framing. The verandah floor is wide timber boards. The verandah ceiling is unlined in places, leaving the timber board roof insulation visible, and in others the ceiling is lined with a further layer of timber boards. The south- east-facing entry is prominent, sheltered under its own projecting hip roof and is reached by short flight of concrete stairs. The verandah width is generally but enlarges to wide in two locations - at the entry and along the front of the sitting and dining rooms; and on the south-west outside the school room. The house layout is divided into quarters by a central, cruciform hallway. At the juncture of this hallway is an octagonal hall with four semicircular archways of decoratively moulded timber, one over each of the corridors. The house has only two windows - fixed casements in the sitting room. All rooms have wide French windows with broad fanlights opening onto the verandah with timber framed flyscreen doors. Generally, the interior has clear finished timber board floors, single-skin timber partitions with moulded timber skirtings, belt rails, picture rails, architraves, and cornices. The ceilings are v-jointed boards. There are built-in timber cupboards throughout the house. The interior retains an original light fitting in the dining room and an original electricity board survives. The service wing is attached to the north-eastern verandah of the main house. It was extensively renovated both externally and internally in recent years and now contains a large commercial scaled kitchen. It has a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets and a ventilated ridge cap. The verandah is shielded from the north- western sun by timber battens fixed in a chevron pattern. A detached building immediately north of the service wing is the dairy/butcher. It is a timber building with a steep, hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets and a ventilated ridge cap. The walls are clad with weatherboards. There is no documented evidence to suggest Robin Dods was the architect. Other alterations to the original building include: * updated bathroom fittings and fixtures * replacement of original timber stumps under the main floor structure with steel posts and concrete footings * new sewerage system. Other outbuildings are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  Myendetta Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 December 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Myendetta (1910) is important in illustrating the contribution of notable architect, Robert Smith (Robin) Dods, to the evolution of Queensland architecture. The homestead is also important in demonstrating the evolution of climatically adapted timber housing in Queensland. It is an exceptional example of design responses to extreme climatic conditions and originally incorporated hydro- electric power. It is a highly intact, representative example of the substantial homesteads built on pastoral land. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As one of only six Queensland homesteads designed by acclaimed architect Robin Dods, Myendetta is a rare and intact example of his homestead designs. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Myendetta is a fine, intact example of the high-quality residential work of Dods that is characterised by a pervading sense of tradition, solidity, and an honest use of materials. Designed in an Arts and Crafts idiom, the low-set timber house has deliberately oversized timber elements and openings; verandah piazza; steep dominant roof; finely detailed, built-in timber furniture; a well-considered service zone; and an interior layout that optimises cross ventilation and solar orientation. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The low-set house with dominant, large roof, generous verandahs and garden stands dramatically in the extensive, flat landscape. A sense of robust, rural domesticity is engendered by its wide verandahs and piazzas without balustrade; spacious, well- ventilated living rooms; and the use of oversized elements, such as the hunkering roof, large, closely spaced verandah posts and large openings. Highly intact, Myendetta is important for its Arts and Crafts aesthetic, notably for its fine craftsmanship, high quality materials and skilful arrangement of informal and formal living spaces.

The collection also includes artworks of artists representing Cubism (e.g., Fernand L√©ger, Louis Marcoussis), Futurism (Enrico Prampolini), Dada (Kurt Schwitters), Surrealism (Max Ernst, Kurt Seligmann), Formism (e.g., Leon Chwistek, Tytus Czy≈ºewski), ‚Äúpure form‚Äù (Stanis≈Çaw Ignacy Witkiewicz) or Unism (W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski).Korespondencje Grupy \\"a.r\\" [in:] Korespondencje. sztuka Nowoczesna i Uniwersalizm, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ 2012 The collection was initiated by the artists and took shape as a result of their solidarity-based international initiative to donate works against any artistic divisions. = 1930s = Karol Hiller, Board with Spiral Originally, the museum was housed on the first floor of the former town hall in Plac Wolno≈õci 1 and its full name read ‚ÄúThe J. and K.

The first exhibition opened on 13 April 1930 and this date is considered to mark the beginnings of what is today Muzeum Sztuki in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. Avant-garde art from the collection of \\"a.r\\" group was made available to the public on 15 February 1931. In 1935 Dr. Marian Minich was appointed the director of the museum and already in the initial years he expanded the collection with works that have complemented the picture of Polish modern art with Polish Formists, the Lviv group of surrealists Artes, and representative works of Jankiel Adler and Karol Hiller. Immediately after World War II, Muzeum Sztuki acquired paintings of Alexej Jawlensky. Soon, the museum was transferred to one of the palaces of the Pozna≈Ñski family, in Wiƒôckowskiego 36, which since 1948 has been one of its locations. Marian Minich was re- nominated as a director. It was he who adapted rooms in the palace to the needs of the museum and invited W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski to cooperate, which resulted in the ‚ÄúNeoplastic Room‚Äù being added to the exhibition space. The collection of contemporary art was expanded with, inter alia, works by Jonasz Stern, Jerzy Nowosielski, and Alina Szapocznikow. = Ryszard Stanis≈Çawski and the Museum of Art in the 1950s = Miros≈Çaw Ba≈Çka, ≈öw.

The second director of the museum became Ryszard Stanis≈Çawski, who headed the institution in the years 1966‚Äì1991. His goal was to expand the international collection of modern and contemporary art. In his museum practice he accentuated the pivotal role of the ‚Äúmuseum as a critical instrument‚Äù and preferred focusing the collection on phenomena that were perceived as open, creative and authentic. Stanis≈Çawski's efforts led to the acquisition of the first painting from Roman Opa≈Çka series of ‚Äúcounted‚Äù paintings (others were to follow), the collection of early works of Krzysztof Wodiczko, Miros≈Çaw Ba≈Çka, and representatives of Warsztat Form Filmowej [Film Form Workshop]. Muzeum also received a collection of works by Czech artists acquired at the end of the Prague Spring (e.g. Ji≈ô√≠ Kol√°≈ô). Mateusz Grabowski, owner of an avant-garde gallery in London, donated artworks representing British Pop Art and Op Art (e.g. Derek Boshier, Bridget Riley, and Pauline Boty). American artists (e.g. Sam Francis, Lawrence Weiner, Barbara Kasten, and Chris Burden) bestowed their works in exchange for artworks of Polish artists.

Insufficient exhibition space was a permanent problem of the Muzeum. In the early 1970s a tender was advertised for the construction of a new building for the museum but the project has never been successfully accomplished due to the economic crisis. In 1973 the museum acquired an industrialist's mansion Edward Herbst Palace in Ksiƒô≈ºy M≈Çyn [Priest's Mill]. Prospects of having a building that could meet exhibition requirements of avant-garde art became real with plans to develop the Manufaktura Shopping and Entertainment Centre in the former Izrael Pozna≈Ñski factory. = The MS2 branch = Atlas of modernity permanent exhibition at ms2 branch In 2006 Jaros≈Çaw Suchan was appointed the director of the museum and he has been holding the post ever since. Funds acquired from the European Union (under the Integrated Regional Development Operational Programme), the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage, Voivodeship Office, and the Marshal Office in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ were used to regenerate and modernise the former spinning mill in the factory of Izrael Pozna≈Ñski. In the autumn 2008 it became a new location of Muzeum Sztuki known as ms2 offering the space of 3000 m¬≤, which houses the Collection of the 20th and 21st Century Art; further 600 m¬≤ are dedicated to temporary exhibitions. The collection is exhibited in a way that departs from both the chronological arrangement of works of art and the idea of a ‚Äòpermanent exhibition‚Äô. New exhibition projects, whose aim is to uncover the potential of the collection anew, are underway within the framework of ‚Äúworks on the collection‚Äù. According to the programme: avant-garde is not treated as a closed chapter that belongs to the past but as a set of ideas, which may still be meaningful to a contemporary viewer. Muzeum Sztuki introduces the audience to contemporary and avant-garde art in locations at ms2 and ms1. In the years 2011-2013 exhibition space in the building in Wiƒôckowskiego was refurbished.

The collection of Muzeum Sztuki in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ was initiated by the members of the ‚Äùa.r.‚Äù group: W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski, Katarzyna Kobro, Henryk Sta≈ºewski, Julian Przybo≈õ, and Jan Brzƒôkowski, who since 1929 had been involved in collecting modern art. It was made available to the public for the first time in February 1931 at the original seat of the museum in Wolno≈õci Square [Polish: Plac Wolno≈õci]. After 1945 the collection has been being supplemented predominantly with the works by contemporary artists. The collection includes artworks by artists, such as: Max Ernst, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski, Katarzyna Kobro, Kurt Schwitters, Kazimierz Podsadecki, Enrico Prampolini, Janusz Maria Brzeski, Teresa ≈ªarnower, Mieczys≈Çaw Szczuka, W≈Çodzimierz Borowski, Derek Boshier, Christian Boltanski, Joseph Beuys, Bridget Riley, Alina Szapocznikow, Ewa Partum, Krzysztof Wodiczko, Edward Krasi≈Ñski, Ali Kazma, Barbara Hammer, Agnieszka Kalinowska, Zofia Kulik, Jadwiga Maziarska, Erna Rosenstein, Jadwiga Sawicka, Ahlam Shibli, Mladen Stilinoviƒá, Mona VƒÉtƒÉmanu & Florin Tudor, Haegue Yang, Konrad Smole≈Ñski, Cezary Bodzianowski, Zbigniew Libera, Artur ≈ªmijewski, Julita W√≥jcik, Antje Majewski, and Allan Sekula.CG2, Atlas nowoczesno≈õci.

Collection of 20th and 21st Century Art  Opened on 24 February 2014 in ms2, a division of Muzeum Sztuki in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, is an overview of the collection featuring works by artists active in the 20th and 21st centuries. The exhibition occupies three floors in the premises owned by Muzeum Sztuki located in the shopping and entertainment centre Manufaktura in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. It covers in total 2700 m2, where the visitors may see more than 200 exhibits whose number changes depending on the exhibition projects hosted in this space. ‚ÄúAtlas of Modernity‚Äù is another stage in the works on Muzeum Sztuki in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ collection that have been continued since 2008 and ‚Äúwhose goal is to research, re-interpret and update the meaning of artworks included in the collection.‚ÄùZaskakujƒÖca podr√≥≈º po wyspach nowoczesno≈õci [accessed on 2016-07-06] . The exhibition refers to the idea of art historian Aby Warburg and his project ‚ÄúMnemosyne Atlas‚Äù, it departs from both the chronological arrangement of works of art and the idea of a ‚Äòpermanent exhibition‚Äô. The exposition ‚Äúhas given up typical linearity that organises museum‚Äôs collection against a timeline of art history and groups artworks into schools, trends, styles or tendencies.‚ÄùRecenzja wystawy: Atlas nowoczesno≈õci. Kolekcja sztuki XX i XXI wieku [accessed on 2016-07-06] . Works focus around 14 notions connected with the idea of modernity: ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù, ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù, ‚Äúcapital‚Äù, ‚Äúmachine‚Äù, ‚Äúcity‚Äù, ‚Äúprogress‚Äù, ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù, ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù, ‚Äúnorm‚Äù, ‚Äútradition‚Äù, ‚Äúcatastrophe‚Äù, ‚Äúme‚Äù, ‚Äúemancipation‚Äù, and ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù; ‚Äúcreating a ‚Äòcollage‚Äô of artworks from different periods representing different aesthetics and artistic attitudes around these notions; the exhibition poses questions about how the phenomena changed, how the way they were perceived altered and, most importantly, to what extent they shape our today's reality.‚ÄùWyborcza.pl, wyborcza.pl [accessed on 2016-07-06] .

The Muzeum accomplishes this goal through, inter alia, cooperation with other museums in the world, publishing activities, education effort (workshops, lectures, guided tours), and its media presence (in cooperation with TVP kultura TV channel, Muzeum Sztuki creates ‚ÄúKulturanek‚Äù [Cultural Morning] - a series of programmes on art addressed to young audience).  ms opus  Project ‚Äúms opus‚Äù is the effect of cooperation between Muzeum Sztuki and Opus FilmFilmoteka film production company ‚Äì it documents exhibitions and presents artists and curators. Video recordings from exhibitions available on the Internet have enabled wide audiences to learn more about Muzeum's exhibition projects.  ms club  ms club is a membership programme intended to attract a community of visitors and sponsors, which is also a kind of subscription that offers free admission to exhibitions and events. Two types of membership cards are currently available: MS CLUB and MS CLUB STUDENT.  ms Award  The award is given by Muzeum Sztuki in recognition of the patronage extended to the Muzeum, its promotion or any other form of active support to its interests in Poland and abroad. It is awarded to institutions, companies, representatives of the media, and private persons as a token of gratitude for their engagement and promotion of active attitudes in culture in the preceding year.Nagrody Previous winners of the ms Award:ms Award ¬∑ 2009: Marzena Bomanowska (for 2008) for helping to promote the events in Muzeum Sztuki, in particular the opening of ms2 ¬∑ 2010: Jaros≈Çaw Przyborowski (for 2009) thanks to whom it was possible to purchase Daniel Buren's work Cabane √©clat√©e for the museum collection ¬∑ 2011: Piotr Dziƒôcio≈Ç (for 2010), for helping to produce films from every exhibition as a part of the ‚Äúms opus‚Äù project ¬∑ 2012: PEKAO S.A. ¬∑ 2013: ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Association for the Encouragement of Fine Arts ¬∑ 2014: TVP Kultura TV channel  Katarzyna Kobro Prize  Paper: Nagroda im.

The idea of the Katarzyna Kobro Prize annually awarded by artists to an artist they wish to honour originates from J√≥zef Robakowski with initial involvement of the late Nika Strzemi≈Ñska, daughter of Katarzyna Kobro and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Strzemi≈Ñski. The Prize is intended to pay tribute to artists representing progressive and exploratory stance, open to creative intellectual exchange who are involved in initiating cultural events. Until 2011 the Prize was awarded by Wschodnia Gallery [Polish: Galeria Wschodnia], however, in 2011 Dariusz Bie≈Ñkowski (the founder of the prize) and J√≥zef Robakowski moved it to Muzeum Sztuki in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The Katarzyna Kobro Prize is awarded every December by a college of representatives of various genres of art.

Since the average lifespan of a pet layer hen is 8‚Äì15 years, henopause has received attention as a potential problem for backyard or urban chicken farmers who are eventually faced with the decision to either slaughter older layers or keep them as non-producing pets.

He is the founder and long-time head of Belgrade's Megatrend University. He resigned the position in 2014 after allegations that he had falsely claimed to have a doctorate from the London School of Economics and had supervised a plagiarized thesis. In 2019, Jovanoviƒá was once again elected as rector of Megatrend. Early life Jovanoviƒá was born in Knja≈æevac, Eastern Serbia (then part of FPR Yugoslavia), on 28 January 1953. He completed high school in Bor (1972) and graduated from the Faculty of Political Sciences of the University of Belgrade (1976). He got his magister degree in the fields of sociology of work from the same school (1979). Jovanoviƒá stated that he gained his PhD degree at the University of Maribor (Slovenia) in 1991 in the field of organizational studies. University career Between 1976 and 1991, Jovanoviƒá was employed at the University of Belgrade (with interruptions due to his engagements in the United Kingdom), and from 1991 at Megatrend Business School; he became a university professor there in 1996. Between 1997 and 1999, he was the Dean of the Faculty of Management in Zajeƒçar. In 1999, he became Rector of Megatrend University of Belgrade. From 1983 until 1989, Jovanoviƒá gave lectures on self-management and work motivation at various foreign universities: London School of Economics (1983), Bradford University (1983), Portsmouth Polytechnics (1983), Freie Universit√§t Berlin (1987), Okayama University, Japan (1989), University of Tokyo (1991), √âcole sup√©rieure de commerce, Grenoble (1997), Seoul National University (1998). Between 1983 and 1989, he was a member of the research team of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in the project called \\"The Future of Work in the Automotive Industry with a View to an Impact of Robotization to the Labour.\\" Jovanoviƒá founded Megatrend University in 1989, which has since been called a \\"degree mill,\\" and is one of a number of private universities in Serbia with \\"reputations for quick, rather than quality, education and links to political parties.\\" The university was funded by war profiteers from Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's party and money from tuition fees was used to fund planes and yachts for Jovanoviƒá and others.  Controversy  In June 2014, British-based Serbian academics criticized the doctoral dissertation of Neboj≈°a Stefanoviƒá, Minister of Internal Affairs of Serbia, and Jovanoviƒá's prot√©g√©. Jovanoviƒá responded by calling the critics \\"so-called scientists\\" who were questioning his credibility \\"with all that I have behind me as a scientist.\\" In response, a law lecturer at the University of Nottingham, Dr. Marko Milanoviƒá, challenged Jovanoviƒá's claim to have a PhD from the London School of Economics (LSE). Jovanoviƒá later resigned as Rector of Megatrend University after being urged to do so by the Serbian Minister of Education. The original story in the Serbian media reported a statement by him that he had obtained his doctorate studying under the \\"famous professor Stephen Wood of the London School of Economics.\\" Wood confirmed that a dissertation had been submitted but that it had been rejected. LSE and the University of London also denied that they had granted Jovanoviƒá a doctorate. Subsequently, Jovanoviƒá left Serbia in 2014, saying that he had \\"no intention of doing anything more in Serbia.\\" Jovanoviƒá later returned to Megatrend, and was again elected its rector in 2019.

Its common name is flame violet, although this name may also refer to other species of the genus Episcia. A number of hybrids have been created.  Description  The species has short hairy stems and reddish to green stolons (runners). Leaves are oval shaped with hairy blades that vary from either a deep copper, reddish-green, or only green. Specks of copper and purple are found on leaf underside. Its flower corolla lobes are orange-red with yellow tube. Although the plant does produce seeds, it typically reproduces by stolons.  Ecology  Aphids and mealybugs feed on the plant. It can be subjected to fungal leaf spots, blights on the stem, and rotting roots. The leaves become scorched if they receive too much sunlight, and the plant can die if it receives too much water or too little air.  Hybrids  The hybrid Silver Sheen The plant was once grown from seeds that were sent to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, from Colombia in 1845. In later years, multiple hybrids with this species were created. While leaf shape varies among hybrids, the flowers always have the same form. Among the hybrids, 'Acajou' has a broad pattern of leaves that are silver-green, 'Chocolate Soldier' has dark leaves with a wide silver midrib, 'Emerald Green' has a narrow silver midrib with silver vein, 'Frosty' is emerald-green with a wide silver midrib, 'Harlequin' has dark leaves, and 'Silver Sheen' has a silver center with dark margins. The naturally occurring variety Episcia cupreata var. viridifolia (Hook.) Hanst. was once recognised, but this is now regarded as a junior synonym of the nominate variety, E. c. var. cupreata.

It consists only of powers of two, and begins:. :1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4, 8, 2, 4, 4, 8, 4, 8, 8, 16, 2, 4, 4, 8, 4, 8, 8, 16, 4, 8, 8, 16, 8, 16, 16, 32, ... For instance, the sixth number in the sequence is 4, because there are four odd numbers in the sixth row of Pascal's triangle (the four bold numbers in the sequence 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1). Additional interpretations The th value in the sequence (starting from ) gives the highest power of 2 that divides the central binomial coefficient \\\\tbinom{2n}{n}, and it gives the numerator of 2^n/n! (expressed as a fraction in lowest terms). Sierpinski triangle generated by Rule 90, or by marking the positions of odd numbers in Pascal's triangle. Gould's sequence counts the number of live cells in each row of this pattern. Gould's sequence also gives the number of live cells in the th generation of the Rule 90 cellular automaton starting from a single live cell.. It has a characteristic growing sawtooth shape that can be used to recognize physical processes that behave similarly to Rule 90.. Related sequences The binary logarithms (exponents in the powers of two) of Gould's sequence themselves form an integer sequence, :0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, ... in which the th value gives the number of nonzero bits in the binary representation of the number , sometimes written in mathematical notation as \\\\\\\\#_1(n). Equivalently, the th value in Gould's sequence is :2^{\\\\\\\\#_1(n)}. Taking the sequence of exponents modulo two gives the Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence..

These numbers grow proportionally to n^{\\\\log_2 3}\\\\approx n^{1.585}, but with a constant of proportionality that oscillates between 0.812556... and 1, periodically as a function of ... Recursive construction and self- similarity The first values in Gould's sequence may be constructed by recursively constructing the first values, and then concatenating the doubles of the first values. For instance, concatenating the first four values 1, 2, 2, 4 with their doubles 2, 4, 4, 8 produces the first eight values. Because of this doubling construction, the first occurrence of each power of two in this sequence is at position . Gould's sequence, the sequence of its exponents, and the Thue‚ÄìMorse sequence are all self-similar: they have the property that the subsequence of values at even positions in the whole sequence equals the original sequence, a property they also share with some other sequences such as Stern's diatomic sequence... As cited by Gilleland. In Gould's sequence, the values at odd positions are double their predecessors, while in the sequence of exponents, the values at odd positions are one plus their predecessors. History The sequence is named after Henry W. Gould, who studied it in the early 1960s. However, the fact that these numbers are powers of two, with the exponent of the th number equal to the number of ones in the binary representation of , was already known to J. W. L. Glaisher in 1899... See in particular the final paragraph of p. 156.

Image taken Sept 2, 2016 Black Angus with the Sierra Nevada Mountains and Mount Rose in the background. At the Damonte Ranch and the 300x300px The Damonte Ranch started in 1939 when Louis Damonte, an Italian immigrant farmed alfalfa and raised cattle. The original Damonte Ranch included about 620 acres known as the Peleg Brown Ranch, at 12945 Old Virginia Road in Reno, Nevada, back in 1864. Author Holly Walton-Buchanan, whose latest book, \\"Land of the Buckaroo: Historic Ranches of Western Nevada\\" includes a chapter in his book on the Brown-Damonte Ranch. Located in the Truckee Meadows and borders Interstate 580, U.S. Route 395 and the Eastern Range, the Damonte Ranch is both a working cattle ranch and a developed community. Development Open spaces of the west brought development including business and industrial parks which were once the Damonte Ranch pasturelands. The Damonte Ranch is part of a master plan of 2,000 acres developed into a community of homes and industrial parks. The usable fertile land has been divided up and sold to developers. The century-old cattle and alfalfa ranch where some cattle still roam and alfalfa still grows has a build-out is set at 15 to 20 years under normal absorption rates. The developers of the Damonte Ranch are involved in turning 10 million square feet ag land into of office, retail and industrial properties and over 100,000 single and multi-family homes. Damonte Ranch is a 1,962-acre master planned community meant for mixed use, with 350 acres of commercial use, 1,162 residential acres, 173 acres of public facilities and 277 acres planned for open space and green belts. Located at the southern end of Reno, just before Mt. Rose Highway and south of Double Diamond Ranch, Damonte Ranch was originally formed by the consolidation of several smaller properties. History Irrigation was important throughout the ranch's history for raising of wheat, oats, barley, corn and hay, and grazing cattle. Today's water system for Damonte Ranch is taken care of through a wholesale agreement between Washoe County and Sierra Pacific. Getting the wetlands delineations and permits from the Army Corps of Engineers. One of the challenges in developing the projects was getting the US 395 interchange built, which resulted in the Damonte Ranch Parkway interchange. The Damonte Ranch High School opened in the fall of 2003 on a 62-acre site donated to the school district by the Damonte Family. The Damonte Ranch is also a place where numerous birds reside and migrate through. Northern Nevada is a migratory path of harlequin duck, cackling goose, red-necked grebe, and medium-sized diurnal birds of prey, white-tailed kite, broad-winged hawk.

His fiction also appeared in Collier's, Liberty, McClure's, Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, and The Saturday Evening Post. Buckley was also extensively published in many pulp magazines including Adventure, Hutchinson's Adventure-story Magazine, Argosy, The Blue Book Magazine, Short Stories , The Story-Teller and Western Story Magazine. For Adventure, Buckley wrote a series of stories set in the Italian Renaissance, revolving around the swashbuckling exploits of condottieri Captain Luigi Caradosso.Frank D. McSherry, Jr., \\"Captain of Adventure: Luigi Caradosso\\" in Pulp Vault magazine, #6, November 1989. Tattered Pages Press, (pp .9-16) The Luigi Caradosso stories were enormously popular with Adventure's readers. When Adventure published a new Caradosso story in the May 1940 issue (after a six-year hiatus), the editor Howard Bloomfield noted that many readers had written in to request that the magazine \\"Bring back Captain Caradosso.\\" Buckley also wrote a novel, The Way of Sinners, set in sixteenth century Italy, in which Caradosso is mentioned. Buckley also published Western, mystery and sea stories as well as historical fiction. Later some of his short stories would be adapted for film or radio by others. The Bearcat, a 1922 Universal Film Manufacturing Company picture, Peg Leg and the Kidnapper, originally published in Western Story Magazine was used for the 1926 Fox Film Corporation film The Gentle Cyclone and RKO Radio Pictures Stung 1931.

It was built from 1860s circa to 1900s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Goondiwindi Customs House Museum is located on the town side of the main bridge crossing the Macintyre River at Goondiwindi. The town developed on the site of a teamsters' camp established where the boundaries of 3 pastoral properties met. Allan Cunningham explored the area around Goondiwindi in 1827. In the 1830s pastoral settlement in New South Wales pushed northwards as graziers looked for new land and in the early 1840s sheep runs were established on the Darling Downs. Early stations were supplied from the south, rather than from Brisbane. Teamsters bringing supplies to the Goondiwindi area came from Maitland and they camped on a rise where the boundaries of Umbercollie, Callandoon and Old Goondiwindi stations met. This hill became the basis for a small settlement, which gradually came to include some permanent residents. The initial site for government services was at Callandoon where a Native Police camp was established in 1849 and from 1859 there was a police station and a post office in operation utilising station buildings. In 1858 the government was petitioned to commission a township survey so that land for settlement could be purchased at the site of the teamsters camp. A survey of the area in 1859 shows no buildings on the town area at that time. The first sale of land at Goondiwindi was held in August 1860 at which 50 residential blocks were sold. By this time Queensland had become a separate colony to New South Wales and the Macintyre River formed part of the border. In 1861 the postal service shifted to Goondiwindi and a courthouse and police station were built. Matthew Maher, a mail contractor, who also purchased several other lots, first purchased the land on which the Customs House Museum stands, in 1863. By 1868, Samuel Droughton was also working as a mail contractor based on Goondiwindi. In March 1872 he purchased the property from Maher. It remained in the ownership of Droughton, who also acted as a dairyman, and then that of his widow, until 1901 when it was sold to the editor of the local newspaper, Edward Drake. In December 1859, Queensland was formally proclaimed as a new colony. In 1862 the New South Wales Border Customs Act no 22 was introduced to allow arrangements to be made \\"for establishing a mutual system of collecting and accounting for all Customs Duties payable upon goods crossing this boundary.\\" At first, the flow of goods into Queensland through the inland routes was not sufficient in either quantity or value to warrant the cost of collecting customs duty in remote areas. However, as settlement increased, the Queensland Government began to feel concern at the amount of revenue that was being lost in this way. Not only did more goods travel north than went south into New South Wales, but duty on such everyday commodities as tea and tobacco was twice as high in Queensland and a considerable amount of smuggling across the border took place. Discussions between the colonies with a view to making adjustment payments were held but came to nothing. In late 1870, the Queensland Government decided to establish a means of control so that an estimated revenue loss of per year could be prevented. In December 1870 A Bill to Provide for the Collection of Customs Duties on Goods Imported Overland was passed. As a first step to implementing this, a border patrol consisting of a police inspector, sub-inspector and 4 constables was appointed with powers to collect duties from 1 January 1871. They were to move along the border between Queensland and New South Wales, collecting duties and keeping careful records regarding the type and value of goods and the amount of monies collected. They were also to note the places were crossings existed and recommend places where Customs offices could be most usefully established. The Inspector, William Parry-Okeden, made a report on their findings in April 1871. 11 places were recommended for setting up customs offices, including Goondiwindi. On 12 April 1871, Richard Marshall, already Police Magistrate, Clerk of Petty Sessions, Land Agent and Land Commissioner at Goondiwindi, was appointed to also act as Customs Officer. He died the following year and was replaced by John Murphy, a sub-inspector of the Customs Border Patrol. It was soon reported that the effect of increased vigilance on the border was to deflect the importation of goods to Brisbane, reducing the amount of such trade through inland centres. Bridge over the Macintyre River at Goondiwindi, circa 1890 Goondiwindi continued to develop however, and in 1880 a bridge, a joint project of the New South Wales and Queensland governments, replaced the ferry service across the Macintyre River. The bridge made it possible to cross the river at this point in all weathers and increased the importance of the town as a border crossing. In 1880 Charles F Cumming was appointed as Customs Officer for Goondiwindi. Cumming was also the Police Magistrate and had held this job and that of Land Agent in Goondiwindi the previous year. In 1881 a second Customs Officer was appointed and there were two officers at Goondiwindi until one was sent to Swan Creek following a reorganisation of staff in 1885. In 1887, Goondiwindi was listed by the Customs Department as one of 8 customs stations along the New South Wales border and was an important public crossing place. The position of Customs Officer seems to have been an extension of police duties for some time and the books concerning Customs business were kept at the Court House even in 1898. There is no formal record of this building being a Customs House and it remained in private hands throughout the period when duties were collected. However, local tradition that it was connected with the Customs service is strong and Customs Officers may have unofficially used it. After Federation of Australia in 1901, customs were no longer charged on goods between the states. The bridge over the Macintyre River was replaced by the present structure in 1914. Around 1900, the shingled roof was replaced by corrugated iron, possibly after it changed hands in 1901. The building has undergone some alterations and extensions over the years of its use as a residence and, in its later years, as an antique shop. The Goondiwindi Town Council acquired it in 1975 and it was renovated by the Goondiwindi Historical Society and opened as a museum in October 1975.  Description  Customs House Museum, 2012 The Customs House Museum site at Goondiwindi is bounded by Maclean Street to the east and MacIntyre Street to the south. It contains a single storeyed timber building, known as the Customs House, at the corner of Maclean Street and MacIntyre Streets; a single storeyed timber cottage facing Maclean Street, and several recently constructed sheds within the grounds. This complex of modest buildings with steeply pitched roofs contributes to the townscape of Maclean St. The Customs House Museum is a simple rectangular building with verandahs to the north, west and east, and an annex attached to the west, linked by a covered verandah. The building appears to have been built in three stages, being progressively extended out to the north and northwest, with the annex included in the final stage. Both the main building and the annex have steeply pitched corrugated iron roofs; the main building has a substantial brick chimney rising above the ridgeline. The verandahs are covered with a gently curved corrugated iron awning, with a skillion linking the annex to the main building. Openings to the south are protected with modest corrugated iron awnings. The external cladding reflects the different stages of construction: the southern end of the building is clad in single skin timber slab with cover strips, with the studs internally exposed; the north eastern corner is clad in chamferboard, with externally exposed stud and bracing, while the rest of the building, including the annex and gable ends is clad in weatherboard. The gable ends are decorated with scalloped bargeboards. The verandahs have chamfered posts with simple rectangular capitals and carved scalloped bases. The balustrades are constructed of square section balusters and handrail. The building has timber sash windows, and French doors opening out to the east. Internally, the building has a full-width room to the southern end and four rooms either side of a central corridor to the northern end. The annex adjoins to the south of the western verandah, and contains two rooms and a toilet. The internal walls vary, corresponding to the varieties of external cladding, with some exposed framework, some horizontal boarding and some vertical; all the ceilings are timber- boarded. The fireplace in the southern room has timber surrounds. The cottage is a modest timber building with a steeply pitched corrugated iron roof, a verandah to the front (east), an annex with a corrugated iron stove recess and timber porch to the rear (west). This building also appears to have been built in different stages, with the main part of the building being clad in weatherboard, while the annex is clad in chamferboard with externally exposed framing. The complex also contains a range of more recently constructed sheds and display structures containing antique machinery.  Heritage listing  Customs House Museum was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Customs House Museum illustrates the role of Goondiwindi as one of 14 border posts established before Federation to maintain tariff walls between the colonies. Customs duty was an important source of revenue and the need to establish such posts reflects the increase in the movement of goods along inland routes as pastoral development occurred in the west of Queensland. Goondiwindi was a major border crossing and the establishment of a customs service in this town reflects the way in which Customs were collected and the requirements of Government were carried out in remote areas. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Customs House Museum is important as an early building in Goondiwindi whose form, scale and materials make a substantial contribution to the built character of the town.

Life and career He was the younger brother of John and Sir Henry Middleton and in 1601 jointly commanded a voyage to the West Indies. In 1604 he went to the East Indies with his brother Henry, as second captain of the Red Dragon, and is mentioned as having conducted the negotiations with the native kings of Ternate and Tidore. He returned with Henry in May 1606, and on 12 March 1606‚Äì7 sailed from Tilbury as captain of the Consent, one of the ships of the third voyage under William Keeling. He had with him as master John Davis of Limehouse. The Consent lost sight of her consorts in the Channel, and, as no rendezvous had been given, went on by herself to the Cape of Good Hope. She anchored in Table Bay on 16 July, with her men in good health. Middleton reluctantly proceeded without Keeling, and after touching in St. Augustine's Bay, arrived on 14 November at Bantam, whence after refitting he sailed for the Moluccas or Spice Islands. He found the Spaniards personally friendly, but having a monopoly of the commerce; and it was not till March 1607‚Äì8 that he could obtain any open permission to trade. He managed, however, to do business privately, and when the permission was withdrawn, within a few days of its being granted, he went to Bangay, and afterwards to Button, where he was well received by the king, and obtained a full cargo of cloves. By 22 May he was back at Bantam, and sailed for England on 15 July. The voyage, though irregular, had been both speedy and profitable. Middleton was recognised as a capable and fortunate commander, and was sent out again on the fifth voyage in a larger ship, the Expedition, in which he sailed from the Downs on 24 April 1609, Davis being again his pilot master. Again he reached the Cape of Good Hope with his men in good health, and after a stay of only eight days went on to Bantam, where he arrived on 7 December. A month later he came to Button, where he entertained the king at a banquet on board; but no trade was to be done, owing to the recent destruction of the storehouses by fire, and he passed on to Bangay. The drunken and dissolute Dutchman domineered over the natives, collected the duties for the king of Ternate, and, keeping for himself as much as he wanted, sent on to the king what he could spare. Middleton, being unable to trade at Bangay, endeavoured to go to the Moluccas. Foul winds compelled him to bear up for Banda, but there the Dutch governor told him plainly that to permit him to buy a nut there was more than his head was worth. He believed that they intended to seize or burn the ship, till he showed them that he was prepared to fight if attacked. At Ceram, after some negotiation, he obtained a full cargo of nutmegs and mace. On his way back to the westward he foiled an attempt of the Dutch to intercept him, and having refitted at Bantam sailed thence on 16 November. He arrived in England in the early summer of 1611. In May 1614 he sailed once more for the East Indies in the Samaritan, with the Thomas and Thomasine under his orders, and arrived at Bantam on 14 February 1614‚Äì15. A full cargo was collected, and after sending the smaller vessels to other ports, Middleton, in the Samaritan, sailed for England on 3 April 1615. But the ship was wrecked on the coast of Madagascar, and though it was at first reported that \\"passengers and goods were saved\\", the loss seems to have been total. The first report of Middleton's death reached the Company on 5 September 1617. No exact news was ever received, but he was registered as dead, and his will proved on 18 April 1618. On 6 October 1624 the court of directors had under consideration a letter in favour of Middleton's son. \\"After much reasoning the court called to mind that the captain lost both ship and goods to a very great value, and therefore they gave it for answer that there is nothing due\\". In his will, dated 20 April 1614, he names his wife Alice, sons Henry and John, daughter Elizabeth, and mentions a child not yet born, also his wife's sister, Jane Pullybancke. He names, too, his brother Christopher, his sisters and their children, several cousins and friends, the bulk of his property being left to his son Henry. Within three weeks of the announcement of the loss of Middleton's ship, his widow had married one Cannon, who on 4 Dec. 1618, in right of Captain David Middleton, was administrator to Sir Henry Middleton, deceased.

Manas Bank started its operations from 1 January 2018, offering a range of corporate and retail banking services. However, within 28 months, on 8 April 2010, following a regime change in the Kyrgyz Republic, the Kyrgyz National Bank placed Manas Bank under its administration to investigate money laundering. Contrary to some reports, Manas Bank was never nationalised by the Kyrgyz government. While continuing to formally belong to Valƒìrijs Beloko≈Üs, on 6 July 2015, Manas Bank was placed into insolvent liquidation. In August 2011, Beloko≈Üs pursued international arbitration against the Kyrgyz Republic claiming that the government's interference with Manas Bank amounted to ‚Äúexpropriation‚Äù of the bank. On 24 October 2014, the arbitral tribunal awarded Beloko≈Üs a US$15 million compensation (plus legal costs) for the ‚Äúexpropriation‚Äù of Manas.UNCITRAL Arbitral Award in the matter of Belokon v Kyrgyz Republic dated 24 October 2014: https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case- documents/ITA%20LAW%207008_0.pdf However, upon Kyrgyz Republic's appeal, on 21 February 2017 the Paris Court of Appeal annulled the arbitral award finding that Belokons had bought Manas Bank ‚Äúin order to develop ‚Ä¶ money-laundering practices‚Äù. The court said such money laundering would not be monitored in Kyrgyzstan because of Beloko≈Üs's ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù relationship with Maxim Bakiyev, the son of the then President of Kyrgyzstan. The court further held that the arbitral award must be annulled because to allow its enforcement would reward Beloko≈Üs for ‚Äúcriminal activities‚Äù, which would be contrary to French international public policy.Judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal dated 21 February 2017 in the matter of Belokon v Kyrgyz Republic: https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw8476.PDF In particular, the court found that after Beloko≈Üs took over Manas Bank, $5.2bn flowed through its accounts in less than three years, and concluded this ‚Äúdazzling success‚Äù in a poor country ‚Äúcannot be explained by orthodox banking practices‚Äù. Bank records presented to the court showed that client accounts had been opened in the names of people whose identification documents, including passport details, had been stolen. One Manas Bank client, New- Zealand-registered company Lakerock Contracts Ltd, had $534m go through its account in nine months. Examination of the company's registration documents found the named company head, and sole signatory for the multimillion-dollar account, was a taxi driver in Belarus. When interviewed on request by the Belarus police, he told officers he had never signed any of the documents and knew nothing about Manas Bank or Lakerock. Another company BMD Commerce, had $24m through its account in a year, including multimillion-dollar physical cash deposits and withdrawals. The authorised account holder on the Manas Bank forms was a resident of Latvia. Latvian police and Kyrgyz border records showed this person to be a 20-year-old man who had never been to Kyrgyzstan. Subsequently, the investigation found he was serving a prison sentence in Latvia when much of the account activity was taking place.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/18/blackpool-takeover- valeri-belokon-owen-oyston The Paris court of appeal concluded in its judgment that Manas Bank ‚Äúwas taken over by Mr Belokon in order to develop, in a state where his privileged relations with the holder of economic power guaranteed him the absence of any true monitoring of his activities, money-laundering practices which could not have flourished in the less favourable environment of Latvia.‚ÄùJudgment of the Paris Court of Appeal dated 21 February 2017 in the matter of Belokon v Kyrgyz Republic: https://www.italaw.com/sites/default/files/case-documents/italaw8476.PDF Beloko≈Üs appealed the judgment to the French Supreme Court on 12 May 2017 but Beloko≈Üs's appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 12 July 2018.

It is a remake of Tamil film Veeram, which was directed by Siva. The music was composed by Anup Rubens with cinematography by Prasad Murella and editing by Gautham Raju. The film released worldwide on 24 March 2017.Sangeetha Devi Dundoo (24 March 2017) Katamarayudu: One-man show. The Hindu  Plot  Kattula Katamarayudu (Pawan Kalyan) is a brave person living in a village called Oddaanchatram. He lives with his four brothers (Siva Balaji, Ajay, Kamal Kamaraju, Chaitanya Krishna). The elder brother loves the younger ones to the core and sacrifices his happiness for their good. They are often caught in fights and are proud of it. Advocate Bail Lingam (Ali) bails them out whenever legal issues arise because of their brawls. Katamarayudu hates the idea of marriage as he feels that his wife might create disharmony among brothers. Though the four younger brothers say that they do not want to either fall in love or get married, when Kattula Katamarayudu is not around, they all have their secret lovers. Now, in order to get the green light for their love stories, they learn through his brother's childhood friend Collector that Kattula Katamarayudu, in school, was in love with a girl named Avantika, and his brothers hatch a plan to find her and reintroduce her to Kattula Katamarayudu so that he can fall for her all over again. However, she is married now and has kids, so the brothers conspire to do the most logical thing, which is to find another woman named Avantika (Shruti Hassan) because Kattula Katamarayudu was not in love with that girl so much as her name, and when he meets another (completely random) girl with that name, he is sure to lose his heart to her just because she bears that name. Though initially reluctant, later Kattula Katamarayudu himself falls in love with her. He clashes with a businessman called Radia (Pradeep Rawat) to take care of the market in the village. Radia tries to kill Kattula Katamarayudu's brothers, while Kattula Katamarayudu kidnaps Radia's son Juttu Ranga (Ayyappa P. Sharma). After clashing, Kattula Katamarayudu orders Radia to leave the village. While travelling in the train to Avantika's village, Avantika narrates her family background to Kattula Katamarayudu. Avanthika's father Bhupathi (Nassar) is a respected man in the village who hates violence, while his son (Ravi Prakash) is the exact opposite who kills people, but when he is killed, Bhupathi refuses to bury his body and decides to make his village with peace and harmony. A few goons enter into the train, but Kattula Katamarayudu bashes all the rowdies. Avantika is shocked to see Kattula Katamarayudu, whom she thought was a nonviolent person. Kattula Katamarayudu and his brothers arrive at Avantika's village with clean shaven looks. He says that he has changed and would never harbor violence, and he and his brothers are welcomed and respected by her family. Bhupathi is touched and impressed by their love, affection, and hospitality. Kattula Katamarayudu comes to know that an illegal goon named Yelasari Bhanu (Tarun Arora) wants to kill Bhupathi and his family. The reason is revealed through a flashback that Yelasari Bhanu's father (J. Mahendran) is responsible for the blast of a matchstick factory. Bhupathi complains against Yelasari Bhanu's father and is arrested, and the father commits suicide by getting hit by a lorry. Yelasari Bhanu swears revenge against Bhupathi. Kattula Katamarayudu finishes all the goons and solves all their problems without the knowledge of Bhupathi and the family. When Bhupathi's granddaughter finds a sickle under Kattula Katamarayudu's jeep, Bhupathi orders Kattula Katamarayudu to go out of town. Yelasari Bhanu, who escapes from the death sentence, arrives to kill Bhupathi, but Kattula Katamarayudu keeps him and his family in a safe place. Yelasari Bhanu informs Kattula Katamarayudu that he had kidnapped one of his brothers, Sivarayudu (Siva Balaji). Kattula Katamarayudu arrives at the nick of time and saves his brother but instead gets attacked by Yelasari Bhanu. Bhupathi and his family, who arrive at the place, come to know about the risk taken by Kattula Katamarayudu to save him from the mess. A brutally attacked Kattula Katamarayudu rises steadily and kills Yelasari Bhanu and his henchmen. Bhupathi, who is impressed with Kattula Katamarayudu's valour, decided to give his hand to his daughter Avantika. The film ends with the marriage of Kattula Katamarayudu and his brothers.

It was built . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 May 1995.  History  Wyaga is situated north-east of Goondiwindi and is thought to be one of the oldest cattle runs in the original Darling Downs district, when the Wyaga run of approximately 60 000 acres was leased by David Perrier in 1849. Donald Gunn with son Donald at Wyaga Station, circa 1862 By the late 1850s Wyaga had been acquired by Thomas de Lacy Moffatt, and W M Turner. Moffatt was the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Western Downs from 1860 to 1864 and Colonial Treasurer from 1862 to 1864. In 1860 it was acquired by Donald Gunn senior. The improvements on the property included a woolshed and several huts. A homestead was built for Gunn from timber hand sawn on the property, with a shingle roof and using square, hand made nails. Gunn sold Wyaga to the Holmes family , and the property passed through a number of hands before being acquired in the 1890s by Thomas Cook and Hugh Munro as part of their grazing empire. The property had been progressively reduced in area. After Thomas Cook's death in 1912, the property was bought by Munro. In 1913 a new partnership was created between Munro and Frederick Charles Turner. The Wyaga merino stud was founded in 1938. A number of outbuildings, including a new woolshed are believed to have been constructed in the 1930s. The partnership between Munro and Turner was dissolved in 1944, and the Wyaga Partnership created. By the 1950s Wyaga was running both cattle and sheep. The homestead was substantially altered and extended, possibly during the 1950s. Wyaga remained in the Munro family until 1975. It was acquired by the present owners in 1982.  Description  The core of the homestead consists of a simple north-south running rectangular plan with a verandah along the western frontage, and remains of a verandah along the eastern frontage. The end rooms have been altered and extended, however the central living and dining rooms remain mostly intact. These rooms have double leaf French doors, with louvres to the outer leaf and glazed timber doors to the inner leaf; the doors have casement fanlights above. The interiors are lined with wide horizontal painted timbers, and boarded ceilings. The western wall has deep chamferboards which may be pit-sawn. The verandah has been closed in with flyscreen, but retains its splayed, chamfered verandah posts. The eastern verandah has been extended out to the east to form part of a large living room; the verandah posts, also splayed and chamfered, are now in the centre of this room, which links the original homestead remains to the rest of the later additions. An appreciation of the overall form of the house, including the now corrugated iron-clad gambrel roof, can be gleaned from the west, and a substantial brick chimney rises above the ridge of the roof.  Heritage listing  Wyaga Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 May 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

The Club played in Serie B during the 1961-62 season and was promoted to Serie A (second series) where, however the following year it was relegated. Afterwards, between 1974‚Äì75 and 1987-1988 seasons, it played the highest Italian league between Series A1 and Series A2. Also it competed in the FIBA Koraƒá Cup for three seasons. Basket Mestre reached the quarterfinals for the allocation of the Scudetto in 1980-81. It also won six junior national titles in the categories: Youth, Juniors, Cadets and Propaganda (1975-1984, 1st in Italian) . Players who started in its youth sector reached the National team (i.e. Renato Villalta, Claudio Coldebella, Claudio Pilutti and Davide Ancilotto). Basket Mestre should not be confused with another local team: Bears Mestre.

This article describes normative theories that have been developed to explain these properties of sensory receptive fields based on structural properties of the environment. Beyond theoretical explanation of biological phenomena, these theories can also be used for computational modelling of biological receptive fields and for building algorithms for artificial perception based on sensory data. Computational theory of visual receptive fields Idealized models of visual receptive fields similar to those found in the retina, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex of higher mammals can be derived in an axiomatic way from structural requirements on the first stages of visual processing that reflect symmetry properties of the surrounding world in combination with additional assumptions to ensure internally consistent image representations at multiple spatial and temporal scales.T.

Lindeberg (2016) \\"Time-causal and time- recursive spatio-temporal receptive fields\\", Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 55(1): 50-88. Specifically, idealized functional models for linear spatio-temporal receptive fields can be derived in a principled manner to constitute a combination of Gaussian derivatives over the spatial domain and either non-causal Gaussian derivatives or truly time-causal temporal scale- space kernels over the temporal domain: T.

Theoretical arguments have been presented of preferring this generalized Gaussian model of receptive fields over a Gabor model of receptive fields, because of the better theoretical properties of the generalized Gaussian model under natural image transformations. Specifically, these generalized Gaussian receptive fields can be shown to enable computation of invariant visual representations under natural image transformations.T. Lindeberg (2013) \\"Invariance of visual operations at the level of receptive fields\\", PLOS ONE 8(7): e66990, pages 1-33. By these results, the different shapes of receptive field profiles found in biological vision, which are tuned to different sizes and orientations in the image domain as well as to different image velocities in space-time, can be seen as well adapted to structure of the physical world and be explained from the requirement that the visual system should have the possibility of being invariant to the natural types of image transformations that occur in its environment.

The shapes of the receptive field functions in these models can be determined by necessity from structural properties of the environment combined with requirements about the internal structure of the auditory system to enable theoretically well-founded processing of sound signals at different temporal and log-spectral scales. Specifically, the resulting spectro-temporal fields in this model obey invariance or covariance properties over natural sound transformations including: (i) temporal shifts, (ii) variations in sound pressure, (iii) the distance between the sound source and the observer, (iv) a shift in the frequencies of auditory stimuli and (v) glissando transformations. Idealized receptive fields of this form can be shown to well model the qualitative shape of spectro-temporal receptive fields as measured by cell recordings in the inferior colliculus (ICC) as well as the linear component of some receptive fields measured in the primary auditory cortex.

It was established in 1882. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Cameron's 1 Ton Survey post was erected in about 1882 on the bank of the Barwon River and marks the official survey of the border between Queensland and New South Wales. The need for an official survey of the border had been recognised for many years but the work was not begun until mid 1879, when officers from both colonies met at the town of Barringun in New South Wales which was close to the border (Latitude 29¬∞S). The surveyors were JB Cameron and J Conder, Trigonometrical Surveyors, from New South Wales and GC Watson, Surveying Commissioner of Crown Lands, Warrego District, from Queensland. John Brewer Cameron was born in Scotland and immigrated to Victoria with his family in 1853. Noted for being athletic and adventurous, he travelled first to the Victorian goldfields and then to New Zealand. Returning to Victoria, he joined a government geodetic surveying party working in the area near Mount Baw Baw. This experience decided him to take up a career in surveying. Following his training, he went to Fiji as a surveyor in 1869, then returned in 1872 to Victoria where he specialised in surveying and geodesy. By 1879 he was a First Class surveyor in the Trigonometrical branch of the NSW Lands Department and a member of the Royal Geographical Society of New South Wales. In this year he undertook his most notable commission, to survey the border between Queensland and New South Wales. The survey work began at Zero Obelisk at Barringun, the division of work between the surveyors being described by Cameron in a letter to his uncle, Ewen Cameron: > Mr Watson is responsible for chainage while I am for the astronomical > portion in finding true meridian, giving true bearing, setting off the > chords, and finding latitude at every convenient site. After observations at Barringun to determine the latitude, the team began surveying the border in a westerly direction to the intersection with the border with South Australia at Longitude 141¬∞ E, known as Cameron's Corner. This was a distance of over difficult country. Watson and Cameron did not get on and they had to contend first with flooding in both the Warrego and Paroo systems and then drought. Health problems and shortages of both food and water added to their problems. Watson withdrew at the post, but Cameron was determined to carry on. This section of the survey took 12 months and 15 days to complete and details of it were given in the first Annual Report of the NSW Department of Lands 1880 Appendix 1. In 1881 Cameron returned to Barringun to survey the easterly section to the Barwon River. This survey was easier with good water and grass available throughout. When the survey was complete Cameron commemorated the event by placing a wooden post weighing one ton and carved with his name on the river bank. It became known as Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post. Although this was not the first border survey, it was the official survey. In 1883 Cameron moved to New Guinea where he carried out important surveys under the direction of Sir William MacGregor. He died on 30 December 1897 in Brisbane during a return trip to New Guinea and is buried in the Toowong Cemetery.  Description  Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post is a timber post high and roughly square in section and is shaped into a pyramid at the top. It is carved with \\"J. CAMERON GS\\" running upwards on one face and \\"LAT 29 \\" on another.  Heritage listing  Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post marks the first official survey of the border between what were then the separate colonies of New South Wales and Queensland when an accurate definition of the border was important for legal and economic reasons. It illustrates a remarkable feat of surveying in the nineteenth century and is a reminder of the extraordinarily difficult conditions under which many early surveyors worked. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post is rare as one of the largest timber survey posts in Australia and marks the termination of the survey by John Cameron, at Latitude 29¬∞. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. As a commemoration of one of his most notable accomplishments, the survey post has an important association with the life and work of John Brewer Cameron, whose work contributed to the development of Australia.

Early in 1608 he was appointed by the East India Company to be captain of their ship Ascension, and general or commander of the fourth voyage to the East Indies. The two ships, Ascension and Union (captained by Richard Rowles), sailed from Woolwich on 14 March 1607‚Äì8, and from Plymouth on the 31st. Touching at Grand Canary and at the Cape Verde Islands, they arrived on 14 July in Saldanha, (Table Bay). There they remained till 20 September, when they sailed to the eastward; but the night coming on stormy and dark, the two ships lost sight of each other and did not again meet. Touching on the way at the Comoro Islands, at Pemba, where her men had a severe conflict with the natives and some white Moors, and at Almirante, the Ascension came to Socotra on 29 March 1609, and on 10 April crossed over to Aden, where the governor, having invited Sharpeigh on shore, as though to a conference, kept him and his attendants close prisoners for six weeks, and released them only on payment of goods to the value of two thousand five hundred dollars. Getting away from Aden without further attempt to trade, Sharpeigh went to Mocha, where there was \\"a good market for English commodities.\\" Thence he returned to Socotra in August and sailed for Surat. On 28 August the ship arrived at Mowa, where they could have got a pilot for Surat for twenty dollars. The master, however, refused, saying that he was able to take the ship in himself. On the 29th he tried it, missed the channel, and stuck the ship on the bar, where in three days she broke up. With some difficulty the men got on shore to Gandevi, where they were kindly received by the governor. On 9 September they reached Surat, but were not allowed into the town. They remained in a neighbouring village till the end of the month, and then set out for Agra, which Sharpeigh, deserted by most of his men, reached almost alone after a tedious journey, and was well received by William Hawkins, then residing in that place. In October 1611 he embarked on board the Trade's Increase at Surat, with Sir Henry Middleton. It would seem that in 1613 he was agent for the company at Bantam, but the notice is vague, and his name does not occur again.

She received several awards for her work in nursing and healthcare, including induction into the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life and education Curtis was born on Oct. 17, 1938 in Chicago. She had Greek ancestry and was the daughter of John and Sue Thoman, who raised her in Independence, Missouri. Curtis moved to various places throughout her life, including Spokane, Washington; Wheaton, Illinois; and Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, she attended William Chrisman High School, from which she graduated in 1956. Though she was interested in becoming an attorney, the lack of female attorneys during this time kept Curtis from pursuing this profession. However, she did become involved in political activism. She attended the Independence Sanitarium and Hospital School of Nursing (now called Graceland University), where she earned her degree as a registered nurse. While in attendance, Curtis served as her school's president of the Missouri State Student Nurses Association. Career After graduating from Graceland University, Curtis relocated to Washington State, where she taught two diploma nursing programs and was the first nurse and youngest person to become President of the Washington State Nurses Association in 1970. Curtis influenced the development of the first political action committee for nurses in Washington, known as Politically United Nurses for Consumer Health (now called WSNA-PAC). She stated that it was the best achievement of her career. Curtis also worked at Spokane's St. Luke's Hospital as an emergency room nurse. The American Nurses Association (ANA) invited her to establish the organization's first political action committee in 1973. The committee, the Nurses Coalition for Action in Politics (N-CAP), was established the following year and Curtis became its first elected chairperson. While in Washington, she helped over 20 states establish their own political action committees and served as a lobbyist in addition to being a consultant and volunteer in several political races at the local and state level. Curtis returned to Illinois in 1976 and became active in her local community and the State Nurses Association. She was an early pioneer of the Nurse Lobby Days, which began after a meeting with four of her colleagues and Illinois' chief lobbyist. After publicly voicing an issue concerning the state of Illinois' welfare system in 1983, she was arrested. However, the charges were dropped at the end of that year's local elections. In 1988, Curtis moved back to Missouri, where she served on Congressman Alan Wheat's Advisory Committee on Health Care. She was elected as a precinct committee person, represented at the state party convention and selected as an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Curtis and her daughter participated in a sponsored event, where she drove an old ambulance in a caravan from North Carolina to Washington D.C. on a health care reform rally that occurred across the United States. The ANA chose Curtis as one of two people to spend three months in Washington D.C. as a White House liaison on health care legislation. Curtis was the chief coordinator and a member of the White House's advance team for a health care rally. In retirement, she served as co-pastor of the Community of Christ congregation in Ormond Beach, Florida and held services at her residence. Personal She was married to Richard Curtis; they had three children. She died October 18, 2015 in her home in Ormond Beach. Legacy Curtis received several honors and awards for her work in nursing and healthcare. She was awarded the Honorary Recognition Award by the Washington State Nurses Association in 1974. Ten years later, the American Nurses Foundation awarded the first Barbara Curtis Scholarship. The honor is awarded to a nurse who makes significant contributions to nursing practice and health policy through legislative and political activity.

It has a total land area of 961 hectares mainly used for agriculture. As of May 2016, it has a total population of 5,737.  History  In the early 1930s, Mu√±oz was considered as a part of Vira Gamu, now the municipality of Roxas. The place was still not so populated and area was full of cogons, talahib, and other trees. The Kalingas were the first inhabitants of the area who first settled in Caratukot, now barangay Marcos, Roxas, Isabela. Within the same year,through the leadership of Regino Abalos, the barangay was named Mu√±oz. It was named after Mu√±oz, Nueva Ecija, the place where they came from. In 1972, Mu√±oz's population started to grow. That's why the leaders of the said barangay headed by Barangay Captain Crisanto Quidasol, the Municipal Council and the Provincial Board of Isabela decided to split the barangay into two forming Mu√±oz West and Mu√±oz East. Marcelo Agpalo, nephew of Regino Abalos was the first Barangay Captain of Mu√±oz West. It was 1972 when Agpalo was diagnosed with a major illness which hampered him to perform his duties as the Barangay Captain and causing him to pass the responsibility to Benigno delos Reyes Jr., the first councilor. He acted as the community Chairman from 1972- 1989. In the year 1989, Barangay election was held and Rogelio Agpalo won as the Barangay Captain. He led Mu√±oz West for almost a decade. During his service, evident improvements as well as peace and order were attained. It was in the year 1998 when he vacated his seat to join a higher position in the municipal elections. Charles Rarama succeeded his office for almost six years. But due to his morbid assassination, he left his office and was succeeded by Bernaldo Agpalo who led the barangay for two years from the year 2005- 2007. In October 2007, another barangay election was conducted and was won by former Barangay Captain Rogelio Agpalo. He led Mu√±oz West with the booming populace of 3,689 for three years (2007-2010).

In his book Muggeridge, a former left-wing radical who became a stridently religious anti-communist, described in glowing terms the work of Mother Teresa's order of nuns in Calcutta's House of the Dying. The book was first published by Harper Collins (). Criticism In his book The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice and also in a 1994 documentary entitled Hell's Angel the journalist Christopher Hitchens derided Muggeridge as \\"that old fraud and mountebank\\". Hitchens dismissed as risible the account of a \\"divine light\\" miracle which Muggeridge claimed to have witnessed in Calcutta's House of the Dying. On viewing footage of the film Something Beautiful for God, Muggeridge attributed the clarity of the images to Teresa's \\"divine light\\". Although the more prosaic and realistic explanation was that the BBC cameraman had loaded a new faster film for some poorly lit indoor shots, Muggeridge promoted this \\"heavenly aura event\\" as a miracle narrative to the media. Hitchens considers that Muggeridge's subjective interpretation of the events he witnessed in Calcutta and the consequent publicity surrounding those events contributed to Mother Teresa's seraphic reputation.Hell's Angel, BBC, 1994 References 1971 non-fiction books Mother Teresa Indian biographies Indian non- fiction books ","title":"Something Beautiful for God"},{"id":"51517645","title":"Sol√°ngel Guzm√°n"},{"id":"51517652","text":"State Road 960 (SR 960), locally known as Northwest 14th Street, is a east‚Äìwest street adjacent to Miami International Airport in western Miami-Dade County, Florida.

Early life Torrance was born in Dunedin, the second daughter of Scottish immigrants Eliza Wright and John Ainslie Torrance. Torrance's upbringing was heavily influenced by religion - her father was the chaplain at Dunedin's hospital, jail and asylum, a lay preacher and elder in the Presbytarian Church, and later worked for the Patients' and Prisoners' Aid Society. Torrance trained as a nurse at Dunedin Hospital, passing her state registration examinations at the end of 1908. Career On graduating, Torrance went into private nursing, and after the Plunket Society was established in 1907, she became one of the earliest Plunket nurses. She resigned from her position, however, over a disagreement with Plunket's founder Frederic Truby King. St John Ambulance invited her to join their organisation, and she worked for them for 13 years, including during World War I. Shortly after the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic, Knox Church in Dunedin hired Torrance as a parish nurse; a bequest in 1915 by a local benefactor provided funds for such an appointment. Torrance held a daily clinic in rooms at the Knox Sunday School in Great King Street, made visits to patients in their homes, dispensed medications and lent nursing equipment as needed. She saw anyone in need in the community, and provided social work services as well as nursing. In addition, she tutored students of the church's Missionary Training Unit and nurses who wanted to become deaconesses. In the 1920s, Torrance was made an honorary deaconess of Knox Church. She retired from nursing in 1943, having served Knox Church for 25 years. She died in Dunedin on 12 December 1949.

The wares often use leaves or paper cutouts to create resist patterns in the glaze, by leaving parts of the body untouched. In the Yuan dynasty Jizhou also produced Qingbai proto- porcelain, as well as brown and white slip-painted wares that borrowed their technique from Cizhou ware, popular wares produced at many sites in north China, and may have been significant in influencing the start of blue and white pottery in Jingdezhen ware, from relatively nearby.Rawson, Jessica (ed). The British Museum Book of Chinese Art, p. 240, 2007 (2nd edn), British Museum Press, Production seems to have begun in the late Tang dynasty or under the Five Dynasties, and continued until the Yuan dynasty.Valenstein, 117 Production seems to have ended suddenly in the 14th century, for reasons that are not yet clear.Google Cultural Institute In a ranking of Chinese wares from 1388, in the Essential Criteria of Antiquities, Jizhou ware is listed in ninth place, above Longquan celadon, which was falling from fashion by then.Clunas, Craig, Superfluous Things: Material Culture and Social Status in Early Modern China, p. 102, 1991, University of Hawaii Press, , 9780824828202, google books  Characteristics  Jizhou ware was known for a \\"tortoiseshell glaze\\" (Áé≥ÁëÅÈáâ d√†im√†oy√≤u), alone or in combination with other types of decoration.Valenstein, 116 The leaf and paper cut-outs were left in place, and burnt away in the kiln during firing. Paper cut-outs featured \\"auspicious characters\\" or simple floral patterns, often spread around the sides of the bowl. The leaves were more often placed in the centre of the bowl, and often only the skeleton of the leaf is seen.Vainker, 123; Valenstein, 116 The technique seems to have been to soak a real leaf in the glaze mixture, then place it on the vessel, where the leaf itself burnt away in firing.Leidy, 65 Another, rather rare, resist glaze effect is called \\"leopard-spot\\".Vainker, 123; British Museum page, \\"Incense-burner\\" \\"Deer-spot\\" decoration, with rows of light brown spots with a white centre, was painted into place.Longsdorf, no. 30 The bodies of the wares seem to have been made entirely from the local low-grade petunse, giving a light buff colour to the body.Valenstein, 116 The painted wares are under a transparent glaze, and the designs can be elaborate and finely- executed. Common motifs include geometric patterns including basket-weave, floral patterns, especially tight \\"fronded spirals\\", and also breaking-waves. All of these, together with handles in the form of fishes with scales and fins, are found on a Yuan dynasty vase in the British Museum, which borrows both its shape and decoration from metalware.Vainker, 123; British Museum page, Object: 1936,1012.85, Altar vase for flowers. Jizhou ware Kiln site It was produced in several kilns at Yonghe Town, Ji'an County, Jiangxi,Valenstein, 115 called the Jizhou Kiln. The historic site has been classified by the government as a major national historical and cultural sites in Jiangxi. Excavations at the site revealed large numbers of discarded fragments of Qingbai, an early blueish-white porcelain, below the layers with brown and white painted wares. Jizhou was clearly one of the secondary sites where this was produced, with Jingdezhen the main centre.Vainker, 124 Notes References *Leidy, Denise Patry, How to Read Chinese Ceramics, 2015, Metropolitan Museum of Art, , 9781588395719, google books * \\"Longsdorf\\": Song Dynasty Ceramics: The Ronald W.

He is a former member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong elected in the 2016 Legislative Council election representing the functional constituency of Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape. On 14 July 2017, Yiu was disqualified by the court over his manner on oath of office at the inaugural meeting of the Legislative Council on 12 October 2016 as a result of the oath-taking controversy. Biography Yiu graduated from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) with a degree in surveying in 1998 and kept on obtaining master and doctoral degrees from the HKU in 2000 and 2002 respectively. He is a member of the Hong Kong Institute of Surveyors, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and various professional organisations. He also started teaching as an instructor and lecturer at the City University of Hong Kong in 2002, became an assistant professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, the City University and the University of Hong Kong and an associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. In 2016, Yiu was elected to the Legislative Council of Hong Kong in the Legislative Council election through the Architectural, Surveying, Planning and Landscape functional constituency, defeating incumbent Tony Tse Wai-chuen with 43 percent of the 5,735 votes cast, against Tse's 35 percent. It was the only defeat for an incumbent across the 30 functional constituencies. At the inaugural meeting of the Legislative Council on 12 October 2016, Yiu made the oath taking ceremony as a platform to protest like other pro-democracy and localist legislators. He added the words \\"safeguarding the institutional justice, fighting for universal suffrage, serving for the sustainable development of Hong Kong\\" in his oath twice and his oaths were invalidated by the clerk. Yiu retook the oath at the next meeting on 19 October. However, the oath-taking controversy sparked by two localist legislators Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching of Youngspiration led to the unprecedented legal challenge from Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying and Secretary for Justice Rimsky Yuen against Yiu. On 7 November 2016, the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) interpreted of the Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, standardising the manners of the oath-taking when taking public office. As a result, the duo were disqualified by the court. Subsequently, the government launched a second legal action against Yiu and three other pro- democracy legislators, Lau Siu-lai, Nathan Law and Leung Kwok-hung, which resulted in their disqualifications from the Legislative Council on 14 July 2017. He ran again in the March 2018 Kowloon West by-election for the seat left vacant by Yau Wai-ching after defeating Frederick Fung and Ramon Yuen in a three-way primary coordinated by the Power for Democracy. Despite there were rumours that his candidacy could be foiled on the basis of National People's Congress Standing Committee interpretation of the Basic Law being applied to the entire term of the current legislature, Yiu survived the disqualification. However, he lost to Vincent Cheng of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) with a narrow margin of 2,419 votes, becoming the first pro-democrat to lose in a geographical constituency by-election since 1992. Notes : Yiu served as member of the Legislative Council until 14 July 2017 when his oath was invalidated and his seat was vacated according to the ruling of the Court of First Instance.

It was built in 1903 by Arthur Bennett. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Anchorage is a two-storied timber house built in 1903 for Andrew William Nixon. The district in which The Anchorage homestead is located was first explored in 1846 by Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of New South Wales, while trying to find a route from Sydney to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Mitchell established a base camp on the site of the present town of St George and in April 1846 St George crossing was named after Mitchell discovered the Balonne River on St George's Day. Two years later, in 1848, the New South Wales Government granted the first St George leases to settlers who established cattle and sheep runs in the area, but it was not until 1863 (after the separation of Queensland) that St George was surveyed as a township. Although the effects of droughts and floods as well as frontier hostilities initially hindered the development of St George, it was described in Pugh's Almanac of 1880 as \\"a thriving township\\". By 1888, St George was \\"a large township\\" and Pugh's Almanac considered it to be \\"the centre of a flourishing pastoral district\\". The 1880s was a period of growth in St George and was at that time a place of opportunity for new arrivals. Andrew William Nixon was one who found success in the district. He was born to Scottish parents at Adelong in New South Wales in 1854. Nixon was apprenticed as a blacksmith in Corowa before moving to Melbourne and then to Jerilderie where he established his own blacksmithing business around the time the Kelly gang of bushrangers was in the area. By 1882, Nixon had made his way to St George with his family and was working in the district on contract work, including the construction of the first bridge across the Balonne River in 1890. Nixon reputedly amassed a small fortune from his contracting and having previously obtained shares in the Australian Steam Sawmills on the Balonne River, he eventually bought out the other shareholders and developed the sawmills into a profitable business. Towards the end of the 19th century, the mills became less viable as the supply of timber in the area diminished and Nixon redirected his energies towards agricultural pursuits. He accordingly purchased 320 acres upon which he erected a homestead and made a viable living from cultivating the land. He then took up about 90,000 acres in the surrounding district, some of which had originally formed part of the \\"Cypress Downs\\" and \\"Mona\\" stations. This acquisition allowed Nixon to expand his pastoral enterprise and its location near the Balonne River provided water for both irrigation and for the steam engines of his sawmill, which today remain on the property. Nixon began construction of The Anchorage in 1903, situated on a 16,000 acre parcel of land on the western bank of the Balonne River and surrounded by a plantation of orchard trees and a flower garden. It was reputedly his third house in the area and is constructed primarily from local cypress pine, which was milled in the Australian Steam Sawmills under the direct supervision of Nixon. Built by Arthur Bennett, this grand house was a reflection of the development of St George by the early 20th century, as well as an indication of Nixon's personal burgeoning fortune. The 12 rooms of the homestead were apt accommodation for Nixon's large family, and were described in The History of Queensland by Matthew Fox as: > \\"large, lofty, and well- ventilated, every attention having been paid to the > important considerations of health and comfort in their design. The > additional offices and outhouses have also been planned with a view to > convenience and fitness, each for the purpose to which it is allotted\\". Nixon remained for many years an active participant in local community life, serving at various times on the Balonne Shire Council and the local hospital board, as well as vice-president of the Balonne Pastoral and Agricultural Association and a number of other community groups. Following Nixon's death in 1951, The Anchorage estate passed to his son, Andrew William Nixon, as administrator of his will. Andrew William Nixon junior died in 1962, after which title is registered in 1969 in the names of his siblings, Marston Alma Nixon, Isabella Ellen Nixon and Charles David Nixon. When Charles David Nixon passed away in 1970, title to his portion of the land was bequeathed to his sisters as joint owners, before Isabella Ellen Nixon was registered as the sole owner of the property in 1974. Four years later, title was transferred to Gureba Pty Ltd, a holding company for SH Andersen & Sons, after which it became a sheep and cattle property, before passing to other owners.  Description  The Anchorage property is situated on Wagoo Road in the Balonne Shire of south-western Queensland. The residence's front facade looks across the road to the Balonne River, as it winds its way north-east out of the town of St George. St George is approximately south of Surat, which is south of Roma. The Anchorage is a two-storey timber house raised off the ground by low stumps. Its core is L-shaped and has a hipped roof. On the ground floor a kitchen in the western corner fills the \\"L\\" to make a square, and is separated from the main part of the house by a breezeway. It is roofed separately with a simple hip. Generous verandahs surround the main part of the house and are also roofed separately. They connect to each end of the breezeway. All roofs are clad in corrugated galvanised iron. On the upper level the verandah edges are made with cast iron balusters and baluster panels, and tapering stop- chamfered timber posts. Below, fitted between each post, are deep, arched valances made of lattice. These have cast iron fringes and brackets. The exterior walls to the main house and the kitchen are clad in chamferboards. The verandah floors are lined with shot-edge timber boards. The ceilings to the lower level verandahs are also lined with timber boards. On the upper level, the underside of the verandah roof is unlined and the rafters are exposed. The front door is on the eastern facade, which looks across to the road and the river beyond. The door is low waisted with four panels, and surrounded by glass and timber sidelights, and a pivoting glass fanlight. The windows opening onto the ground floor rooms of the main house are large double-hung sashes, with a single pane in each sash. Inside, on the ground floor, the main core of the house consists of four large rooms disposed either side of a central hallway. This hallway opens, at the end opposite to the main door, into the breezeway that separates the main house from the kitchen. A cedar stairway leads from this hall to the level above, completing its half- turn using winders. The joinery throughout the house is cedar, but it is otherwise constructed with the pine, possibly cypress, cut and milled by the owner's company. There is a further straight stair situated on the rear, north-western verandah. On the upper level there are six rooms disposed around the hallway, two to the right after leaving the stair, and four to the left. Each room opens onto the encircling verandahs, as do each end of the hallway. A small skillion-roofed structure has been attached to the rear, north-western facade of the house. Also, in the yard area adjacent to the south-western facade of the kitchen, is situated a small meat house. This structure has a pyramid roof clad in corrugated iron, and supported in part by chamferboard clad walls and timber posts. A narrow zone between the underside of the roof and the wall cladding is open to encourage ventilation.  Heritage listing  The Anchorage was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Anchorage demonstrates the development of the St George district in the early 20th century, being a modern and quite urban homestead built on what was one of the first properties producing commercial agricultural crops in the area. It is also of interest as the home of Andrew William Nixon, a saw miller, who personally selected and supervised the cutting of timber used in its manufacture, thus providing an example of building practices in this era. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Anchorage has considerable aesthetic appeal as a well-designed and constructed building made of local materials and as a grand house designed in response to contemporary views regarding health and climate. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Anchorage is important for its association with Andrew William Nixon, a local pioneer and influential member of the community who made a considerable contribution to the development of the district.

The branches have raised lumps, especially near their ends and the leaves are narrow, linear to needle-like, long and wide. The leaves and stems are covered with powder-like short, matted hairs. Unlike those in subspecies pterocarpa, the leaf bases are not twisted The flowers are brick- red on their outer surface, orange inside the petal tube, lack spots and are arranged singly in the leaf axils on a stalk which is long. There are 5 sepals which are narrow egg-shaped to triangular and of approximately equal lengths. The petals, which give the flowers their colour are long and joined in a tube with 5 lobes at the end. As with the leaves, the sepals and petals have a dusty covering of short, fine hairs. Flowering occurs between June and July and is followed by fruits which are flattened and dry with papery wings.

LX The date of origin of the pieces in the Twelve Little Preludes collection is presumed to be around the first half of the 1720s, that is the period of Bach's later years in K√∂then and his first years in Leipzig, where he had become Thomaskantor in 1723. In January 1720 he had started the Klavierb√ºchlein (keyboard-booklet) for his eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann, who was nine years old at that time. =Pieces from Wilhelm Friedemann Bach's Klavierb√ºchlein= Seven of the Twelve Little Preludes were adopted from Wilhelm Friedemann's Klavierb√ºchlein:Alfred D√∂rffel, editor.

It was built from 1860s circa to 1880s circa. It is also known as Gerar. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 2 June 1996.  History  Bullamon Homestead, on the Moonie River southwest of Thallon, was established by the early 1860s, being marked on Surveyor Francis Thomas Gregory's map of the district drawn in April 1864. In the 1880s Bullamon was head station for the largest aggregation of leases ever recorded in Balonne Shire. The name is understood to mean \\"biggest waterhole\\", and the homestead is located on a large sandy ridge above the Moonie River. Scattered settlement had spread north from the Liverpool Plains to the Moonie River area as early as the mid-1840s. The Maranoa, a vast area of first-class grazing land watered by the Moonie, Balonne, Narran and Culgoa rivers, was gazetted a pastoral district in 1848, following Sir Thomas Mitchell's exploration of the area in 1845-46. A grab for land ensued and by 1862, the whole of the Maranoa had been taken up as pastoral runs. Bullamon Homestead was erected on Gerar, a small sheep run of just over 20 square miles, first leased to Richard Bligh in 1857, but transferred in 1859 and again in 1860, before taken up by Leonard McKay in 1864. In 1866 the lease was transferred to John McKay & James McCormick. Duncan Forbes McKay, grazier, and his young family were resident at Bullamon by at least October 1866, and it is likely the log house had been constructed by this time. By 1868 Bullamon Homestead supported the McKay family, an overseer, 4 drovers, 2 contractors (probably ringbarking or fencing), a storekeeper and a blacksmith. The lease was transferred to DF McKay in 1873, by which time he also owned Nindi-gully homestead on the Ana Ninghan East run on the Moonie River, north of Gerar, and held the leases to several other runs in the area and along the Culgoa River. By 1874 McKay was based at Nindi-gully, and his general manager, William Turnbull, occupied Bullamon Homestead. About 1876 James Hill replaced Turnbull as manager at Bullamon, and two of his infant sons who died in 1877 and 1882 lie buried near the house. In 1880 McKay sold the Gerar lease and Bullamon Homestead to Hurtle Fisher of Melbourne. In the early 1880s, Melbourne brothers Charles Brown and Hurtle Fisher, who already held extensive pastoral leases in South Australia, Victoria, and the Darling Downs, purchased the leases of various small Maranoa runs totalling over 2 million acres, known locally as \\"Fisher Country\\". Although not in partnership (Charles operated his Queensland interests as CB Fisher & Co. and Hurtle was in partnership with James Hill of Adelaide as Fisher & Hill) Charles backed Fisher & Hill financially. The largest of their aggregations in what later became Balonne Shire was Fisher & Hill's Bullamon. When consolidated in July 1888 under the provisions of the 1884 Crown Lands Act, Bullamon comprised 42 runs in the Moonie River area and totalled approximately . Bullamon Homestead was the head station for this group, with buildings valued at in September 1887. There were two outstations: Nindi-gully on Ana Ninghan East run and Bandy Andy on Minimi. Following consolidation the property was divided, with nearly 780 square miles resumed for grazing farms and 593 square miles, including Bullamon Homestead, retained by Fisher & Hill as leasehold. The Fishers had bought into the Maranoa in the early 1880s during good seasons. However, severe drought in 1883-84 followed by widespread depression in the pastoral industry post-1885, forced CB Fisher to float the Fisher brothers' Queensland properties as the Australian Pastoral Company Limited in England in 1888. By 1890 the Company controlled all the Fishers' vast Maranoa holdings: Noondoo (over ); Cubbie (over ); Gnoolooma (over ); Doondi (over ); and largest of all, Bullamon, acquired in January 1889, to which was added Hollymount, Burgorah, Weeyan and Wagoo (totalling ). During the 1890s, the Company ran up to 1,000,000 sheep and operated 7 big shearing sheds and 3 woolscours on \\"The Group\\". The general manager resided at Noondoo Homestead, which was more central to the Company's holdings than Bullamon. In the early 1890s the Company made substantial improvements, including re-roofing a number of Bullamon buildings with corrugated iron. Of all the Australian Pastoral Company's holdings, the Bullamon aggregation was most prone to flood, drought and prickly pear, and made constant losses through the 1890s and early 1900s. Floods in 1890 sent of water through the Bullamon Homestead residence and drowned 60,000 of the leasehold's 125,000 sheep. After the 1902 drought Bullamon was shut down and remained unstocked until seasonal conditions improved. Small resumptions were made in the 1890s and in 1904 a further 133 square miles was taken. In 1910 the St George Progress Association requested that the government resume all of Bullamon, much of which was thickly infested with prickly pear, for closer settlement. In 1914, 200 square miles was surrendered to the government, leaving the Australian Pastoral Co. with 240 square miles, most of which had been ringbarked and kept free of prickly pear. By the 1960s all of the Bullamon leasehold had been converted to grazing farms. Bullamon Homestead was acquired in the late 1960s by a new owner, who occupied the s residence until 1985. Before 1911, when the South Western railway line was extended to Thallon, Bullamon was a Cobb & Co stop and stabled horses for them from at least 1898 through to 1912. The homestead was also on the mail service from St George to Mungindi in the early years of the 20th century. Today, the homestead is located on the Carnarvon Highway, the principal highway from New South Wales to St George and western Queensland.  Description  The Bullamon Homestead site extends about along the east bank of the Moonie River, and encompasses a residence, associated buildings and foundations, and an extensive garden. The outbuildings include a bath house, tank stand, and out house. There are the remains of a brick drain water reticulation system for the gardens. The house originally consisted of a two-roomed building of dropped-log construction (probably Cypress pine), with a hipped, shingled roof and verandahs on all sides. This core, with its massive timber uprights, horizontal dropped logs, and shingled roof, survives, and sits on the original bedlogs. Other evidence of early construction includes treenails, adzed timber and an early system for barring the doors with internal metal fittings. A s corrugated iron roof has been placed over the shingle roof, and there are two false dormer vents in the corrugated iron roof near the chimneys of the kitchen and living room. The interior and some of the exterior walls are lined with wide, horizontal tongue and groove boards, at a later date to the original construction, probably 1870s or 1880s. The living room ceiling is angled above door height matching the angle of the original roofline. Several early doorways are boarded over with the tongue and groove lining and the kitchen has a later flat, boarded ceiling. A later partition in the northern room, now the lounge room, forms a central hallway. The southern room is a kitchen. There is a brick fireplace and chimney in the north wall of the lounge room and in the south wall of the kitchen. The kitchen fireplace has been replaced with a stove recess containing a Crown wood stove, in the western wall of the kitchen. Sections of the verandahs have been enclosed variously with corrugated iron, timber and gauze as bedrooms: two rooms on the north verandah, each with a hessian ceiling and one with canvas lining to the walls; an adjacent bedroom on the northern end of the west verandah; a room on the south verandah; and another at the southern end of the east verandah. There are a number of outbuildings associated with the residence. The bath house, of timber-framed weatherboards with a corrugated iron roof, is a later structure to the residence. There is an early square tank stand nearby. A two- seater weatherboard outhouse has a square pyramid roof of corrugated iron with a wood finial. To the south of the out house is a small burial ground containing the graves of two children buried in 1877 and 1882. Further south are the remains of a gardener's hut. The remains of an extensive garden are visible. Ornamental gardens to the east and north of the house remain along with remnants of the brick irrigation drains which supported a large vegetable garden.

Abukutsa-Onyango is a professor of horticulture at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology whose work focuses on African indigenous food crops. Abukutsa Onyango has studied how African indigenous vegetables can be used to combat malnutrition in Africa while maintaining a secure form of revenue even during more challenging weather and climate.  Early life and family  Mary Oyiela Abukutsa-Onyango was born on 20 February 1959 in Ematsuli, Kenya. She is the third born in a family of eight children to Enos Abukutsa Masele and Rosebella Amumbwe Abukutsa. She was baptized at Ilungu Seventh Day Adventist church in August 1975 by Pastor Washington Buka. While growing up in Kenya, Abukutsa-Onyango became ill due to an allergy to animal proteins, so her family cooked African vegetables that were abundant where she lived such as African nightshade, jute mallow, and the greens of cowpeas. One of her grandmothers cooked pumpkin leaves with peanut or sesame paste. Abukutsa-Onyango's father, Enos encouraged and supported his daughter becoming academic, and her mother Rosebella taught her to love and care. Abukutsa-Onyango married J.C. Onyango on 3 April 1987 and had two boys, Douglas Ochieng‚Äô and Anthony Okelo.  Education  Abukutsa-Onyango attended Ematsuli Primary School from 1966 to 1972 in Emuhya, Kenya. She later attended Bunyore Girls High School from 1973 to 1976 in Wekhomo, Kenya and Ng‚Äôiya Girls High School in 1977 in Ng‚Äôiya, Kenya. She obtained a Bachelors of Science in Agriculture in 1983 from the University of Nairobi. She received her Masters of Science in Agriculture in 1988 from the University of Nairobi. Finally, she received her Doctor of Philosophy in Olericulture, Plant Physiology and Nutrition in 1995 from Wye College, University of London.  Career and works  Abukutsa-Onyango's interest and appreciation of indigenous African vegetables was sparked by an allergy to animal proteins she had as a child. This led her to pursue a career in agriculture as she wanted to ‚Äúunravel the potential hidden in African indigenous vegetables,‚Äù she said. She has been involved in research of African indigenous vegetables since 1990 on an academic level and a practical level with farmers. She surveyed Kenya's indigenous plants to investigate the viability of seeds used by farmers. Her research has changed and she focuses on the nutritional properties of vegetables. Her research has shown that amaranth greens, spider plant, and African nightshade contain substantial amounts of protein and iron and are rich in calcium, folate, and vitamins A,C, and E. The cooking of these vegetables as studied by Abukutsa-Onyango could help combat malnutrition in Africa as they provide necessary nutrients and proteins to those who cannot afford meat. Abukutsa-Onyango is a member of the African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD) team, a program created to increase the skilled women demographic supporting Africa's women farmers. With this profile, Abukutsa-Onyango has been able to influence Kenya's policy-makers. For example, the Health Ministry has advised hospitals to use African indigenous vegetables in HIV patients‚Äô diets. Abukutsa-Onyango has published over 20 peer-reviewed scientific articles and now teaches as a professor of horticulture at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Juja, Kenya.  Advocacy  Abukutsa-Onyango has advocated the consumption of African indigenous plants for over 20 years. She has led public education campaigns and worked with restaurants and supermarkets in order to find out how to incorporate these more nutritious, indigenous vegetables into the diets of the people. A significant problem was that people did not know how to cook the vegetables. Abukutsa-Onyango sought out the recipes lost by newer generations and tested them for nutritional value. Abukutsa-Onyango believes that the African indigenous vegetables have significantly more nutritional value than exotic vegetables like cabbage and spinach. She advocates the return of these crops to address issues of nutrition, health, and poverty. In 2010 she also spoke about the difficulties of publishing her ideas and the importance of Open Access at the University of Nairobi Library arranged by Bioline International. Abukutsa-Onyango has spoken at TED@Nairobi for the TED2013 Talent search. She gave evidence of the lack of vegetable consumption by Africans and plans for further commercialization and promotion of African indigenous vegetables. She briefly mentions the advantages of growing these vegetables such as their short growth period, adaptation to local climate, stress tolerance, and nutritional value.  Awards and recognition  * Abukutsa-Onyango's research was showcased to US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton on 5 August 2009 at NARL-KARI. * She won first prize and RUFORUM trophy for a Young Professionals and Women Scientist Research Competition in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and was recognized by the African Union. * She received the CGIAR Science Award for Outstanding Communications by the Consultative Group in Agricultural Research (CGIAR) in 2007. * She was awarded International Scientist of the year 2002 by the International Biographical Centre, Cambridge, England. * She received the Edinburgh Medal in 2014 for dedication to finding sustainable solutions to obesity and malnutrition in Africa.

He is noted for his contribution to cluster chemistry and the design of organometallic compounds with biomedical applications. Early life and education Born in Christchurch on 24 April 1940, Robinson was the son of Jack Robinson and Lurline Robinson (n√©e Cross). He was educated at Christchurch Boys' High School, and then studied at the University of Canterbury, graduating Master of Science with second-class honours in chemistry in 1962. He completed a PhD at the same institution in 1964. His thesis, titled Studies in the coordination chemistry of certain transition metals, elucidated the first structure of a cluster compound and its unusual delocalised bonding. On 12 May 1962, Robinson married Judith Rae, and they went on to have four children. Academic and research career After periods of post-doctoral research at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne and the University of Manchester in 1965 and 1966, Robinson was a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Otago in Dunedin from 1967 to 2006. He became a professor in 1985 and the Mellor Professor of Chemistry in 1996, and served as the head of the Department of Chemistry from 1986 to 1998. When he retired in 2006 he was made a professor emeritus. Building on his doctoral research, Robinson proposed that metal carbonyl clusters could participate in electron transfer reactions, and demonstrated that clusters are able to be reversibly reduced. Other research areas that he pursued included the design of organometallic compounds for use in biomedical research, and the development of molecular switches. Later life and death Following his retirement, Robinson continued to be an active researcher, including work to develop a post-surgical protective gel based on chitosan from squid. The resulting product was sold to American medical technology company Medtronic in 2012. In 2013, Robinson became chair of the board of the Dunedin branch of the University of the Third Age. Robinson died in Wellington on 30 August 2016. Honours and awards In 1999 Robinson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. In 2010 he was awarded a Marsden Medal by the New Zealand Association of Scientists, in recognition of his lifetime contribution to science.

Early life Best is thought to have been the son of Captain George Best, who travelled the Arctic with Martin Frobisher. Career Thomas Best is thought to have gone to sea when aged around thirteen and by 1598 he was a man of substance and repute, well known in Ratcliff and Limehouse. On 30 December 1611 he was appointed to command the Red Dragon, a ship of some 600 tons and 200 men, then fitting for a voyage to the East Indies. As well as Red Dragon, the full fleet consisted of the Osiander pinnace joined later by the James and Solomon., The ships sailed from Gravesend on 6 February 1611 (OS) 1612 (N.S.) and arrived at Surat, on the north west coast of India, at the beginning of September, much to the annoyance of the Portuguese, who had previously established themselves in the country. They collected a force of four galleons, each as large as the Red Dragon, and some twenty small craft, row-boats carrying many men, and on 29 October appeared off the mouth of the river, where they hoped to surprise the English. Best, in the Red Dragon, at once weighed anchor, stood out to meet them, and passed between two of their ships, firing into each. This caused the Portuguese to pause. The darkness closed in, and they had to anchor for the night. The next morning the Osiander also came out, and when three of the galleons, in trying to avoid the Red Dragon, got on shore, the Osiander, drawing little water, \\"danced the hay about them, and so payed them that they durst not show a man on their decks.\\" The fight continued till dark of the second day. The third day was very similar to the second. Towards evening the Portuguese drew back and attempted to burn the Red Dragon by means of a hastily equipped fireship. This Best succeeded in sinking before she got dangerously near, and so the fight ended. The loss of the English was returned as three killed and one wounded; that of the Portuguese was certainly very heavy. Some few days later the Portuguese attempted a further attack in what became known as the Battle of Swally, when Best, again standing out to sea, engaged them with such resolution and skill that after four hours' severe fighting they made all sail to get away. The flight was witnessed by thousands on the shore. The Great Mogul Jahangir was now quite willing to recognise the English as having rights equal to those of the Portuguese. Thus English trade was placed on a permanent footing, and the birth of the English power in India may properly be dated from this November 1612, rather than from any of the semi-piratical voyages of previous years. In January 1612‚Äì13 Best in the Red Dragon, accompanied by the Osiander, left Surat, and, passing down the coast, crossed over to Aceh, where he arrived on 12 April. He described (12 July) the king and people as very griping, base, and covetous. All trade was forbidden except at Banda Aceh: but by releasing a Portuguese whom he had captured, he succeeded in winning the favour of the king, who gave him the title of Orancaya pute which is 'white or clear-hearted lord.' He also obtained permission to open a trade with Siam (now Thailand, and received assurance of good entertainment. At Bantam he obtained a grant of land on which to build warehouses, and when, having got a full cargo, he sailed in November on the return voyage, the company's affairs in the East were far more satisfactorily settled than before. The Red Dragon, \\"richly laden,\\" arrived in the Downs in the first week of June 1614, and Best shortly afterwards attended the EIC Council to give a detailed account of his proceedings. He was considered to have \\"deserved extraordinarily well,\\" though at the same time some dissatisfaction was expressed at \\"his great private trade\\". The question was left to the EIC governor, Sir Thomas Smythe, who gave his opinion that no one could be a fitter commander than Best, but that for merchandise Captain William Keeling was far before him, and should be sent to Surat (7 September). Best refused to go on the voyage without private trade, and a few days later (16 September), nettled, it would appear, by the refusal of the council to give his son an appointment as one of their factors, he refused to go at all. As he very shortly afterwards (27 September) signified his willingness to go another year, it is not improbable that the council gave way. Reports to his disadvantage, however, continued to be circulated, so that Best insisted on an investigation. The decision was that the company was \\"content to remit all that is past and let these things die, which should not have been ripped up, had he not called them in question himself\\" (24 October 1615). In October 1617 the question of sending out a chief commander to Bantam came before the council, and after discussing the relative merits of Sir Richard Hawkins, Sir Thomas Dale, and others, they requested the governor to confer with Best as the fittest of all. Best accepted the appointment, and agreed to sail again in the Red Dragon, but a complaint was presently lodged against him for having appointed his son as a master's mate. On this and other matters Best took high ground; he was summoned before the court, and after some discussion and his refusal to sign a bond for ¬£6,000 to perform the articles agreed on, he was dismissed the company's service (26 November) He afterwards (27 January 1617‚Äì18) made his peace with them, but he does not seem to have again accepted any office under the company. It is probable that Best had already served in royal ships, and from this time he was actively employed under the crown. In 1623 he commanded the Garland (a 38/48-gun galleon, built in 1590), and when the fleet sailed for Spain to bring back Prince Charles, Best remained as senior officer in the Downs. He had previously been engaged in the prevention of piracy, or the pursuit of pirates, and he would probably have had more of the same duty, had not the insolence of the Dutch, in destroying a Dunkirk privateer at Leith and blockading another at Aberdeen, rendered it necessary to send a small force to the coast of Scotland. It was determined that Best was the proper man to command this expedition; but the Bonaventure, the only other ship available, was commanded by Sir William St Leger, who held that, as a knight, he could not be under the orders of Best. The commissioners of the navy recommended that St. Leger should be superseded in the Bonaventure by some captain of 'meaner quality.' Captain Christian, who had formerly commanded the Osiander with Best, was accordingly appointed in his place. The Garland and Bonaventure sailed from Margate on 30 June, and, having gone to Abereen, brought the blockaded Dunkirker to the Downs, closely attended by two of the Dutch ships, and when, on 29 July, the convoy attempted to run off by herself, the Dutchmen would have made a prize of her if Best had not beaten them off. He vowed vengeance, but the Dutch ships outsailed him. On 4 August they had all anchored in the Downs, the Dutch at some distance, when Best slipped alongside of them in the dark, and beat them out of the road. The next day the Dutch gathered in force, and threatened summary punishment, unless he could show the king's commission for what he had done. As naval commissions then, as now, were signed only by the admiralty, Best had not the authority the Dutch required, and to evade the difficulty he was ordered to bring the ships up to Gravesend. Eventually he was superseded, and the Dunkirker was sent home with a safe-conduct from the Dutch. In 1627 Best commanded the Vanguard (19 March 1626-7), which formed part of the fleet assembled at Portsmouth under Lord Willoughby, and in the disastrous expedition to Rh√© in 1627. Later life In September 1630 he was member of a commission to report on the keeping of the king's ships at Chatham and Portsmouth, and in April 1632 of another to consider the manning of ships. In 1633 he seems to have been senior warden of Trinity House, and in 1634 to have been master; in 1637 he appears to have been still master of the Trinity House; and in April 1638 he sat on a commission for inquiring into frauds in the supply of timber. This is the last mention of him that can be traced; it seems, therefore, probable that he died shortly afterwards.

It was launched on 4 March 2019. The transport card enables the user to pay for travel, toll duties (toll tax) , retail shopping, and withdraw money. It is enabled through the RuPay card mechanism. The NCMC card is issuable as a prepaid, debit, or credit RuPay card from partnered banks such as the State Bank of India, Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, and others.  History  In late 2010, the Government of India envisioned a scheme wherein seamless access could be granted to public transport networks. The system, which later came to be known as Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS), aimed to let passengers to pay across different public transport platforms using one system. This was created as an effort to bring together the public transport system of the country under one umbrella. By making it accessible to every individual in every city, the government aimed to increase ease of access for public transport. The project is also structured in such a way so as to include customers across a wide variety of socio-economic strata. An additional focus was also put on reducing the transaction time to the minimum, so as to make the payment experience as seamless as possible. It is also structured in such a way so as to reduce the financial risk to the stakeholders involved in the effort. It is designated as an EMV-based Open Loop Payments system. The NCMC is an indigenously made product, and is a part of the Make In India project. It was first conceptualised in 2006 as part of the National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP). A previous attempt to develop a similar national mobility card led to the development of the More Card. Given its lack of seamless functioning across the nation, Venkaiah Naidu, the then Minister of Urban Development, set up a committee to recommend a card which is inter-operable across different transport systems in the country. The urban development ministry brought in the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) with the task of management, clearing and settlement of payments, simulating cards and terminals and maintenance of network. Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has created the reader prototype. On 8 April 2019, The Economic Times reported that Visa was seeking to issue National Common Mobility Cards. Visa announced that it had launched specifications to support the NCMC on 13 May 2019. Visa is ready with the specifications to start issuing cards on the NCMC network and has started discussions with banks to issue their cards on NCMC as well, but it will take some time for the cards to start getting rolled out in the market. Mastercard stated on 22 May 2019 that 15 Indian banks were at \\"various stages of signing up\\" for its NCMC. Mastercard is all set to join the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) scheme, just weeks after its biggest competitor Visa said it planned to enter the programme as per Vikas Varma, senior vice-president, account management for South Asia at Mastercard. Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) is planning to implement the ambitious scheme in Mumbai suburban railway network in a step towards integrated ticketing system (ITS). Acceptance In March 2019, the Chief Secretary of the Government of Telangana directed state officials to explore the possibility of introducing National Common Mobility Card for use on all public transport in Hyderabad, as well as for autos, taxis and ride sharing services. In April 2019, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited announced that it would implement the National Common Mobility Card on Phase 2 of the Namma Metro. The agency will spend to install the necessary technology. The existing contactless smart cards used on the system will eventually be phased out. The Hindu reported in May 2019 that Mumbai may become the first city to implement the NCMC. The city's 17 public transport companies had previously begun work on developing an Integrated Transport System (ITS), which would be replaced by the NCMC. Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) buses are set to become the first public transportation in India to roll out the National Common Mobility Card (NCMC). The one nation, one card system will initially be implemented on a pilot basis from November, 2019 and will be available widely only from 2020. More than 10,000 BEST conductors will be given the hand-held devices that would be able to scan the NCMC cards with just one tap, alongside generating paper tickets.

She was known for her ethnographic work in the Trobriand Islands and her development of the concept of inalienable wealth in social anthropological theory. Her dissertation studied the contribution of women to the economy of Trobriand society, which had been the site of Bronislaw Malinowski's renowned studies of the Kula exchange. She demonstrated that women's contributions were highly significant but largely erased from record because the cultural focus was on the distribution and exchange of valuables rather than its production.Gary Ferraro, Susan Andreatta. 2011. Cultural Anthropology: An Applied Perspective. Cengage Learning, pp. 86‚Äì87. The dissertation was published in 1976 by University of Texas Press under the title: Women of Value, Men of Renown: New Perspectives in Trobriand Exchange. It received intense attention and became a highly influential piece of feminist anthropology. In 1992 she published the book Inalienable Possessions: The paradox of keeping-while-giving at the University of California Press, in which she built on work by Marcel Mauss and Malinowski to present a theory of value and exchange in which there is a basic distinction between alienable and inalienable forms of wealth. Inalienable wealth is a kind of possession that is inalienably tied to its original possessor and which if given away retains some part of them, such wealth has the power to create lasting social divisions.Regna Darnell, Frederic Wright Gleach (eds.) 2002.

The riddle is one of a number to include runes as clues: they spell an anagram of the Old English word higor√¶ 'jay, magpie'.Robert Stanton, 'Mimicry, Subjectivity, and the Embodied Voice in Anglo-Saxon Bird Riddles', in Voice and Voicelessness in Medieval Europe, ed. by Irit Ruth Kleiman (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), pp. 29-43 (p. 32), doi:10.1007/978-1-137-39706-5_3. There has, therefore, been little debate about the solution.Though for an exception see Emma Sonke, 'Zu dem 25. R√§tsel des Exeterbuches', Englische Studien 37 (1907), 313-18. Text and translation As edited by Williamson and translated by Stanton, the riddle reads:The Old English Riddles of the Exeter Book, ed. by Craig Williamson (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1977), p. 82; Robert Stanton, 'Mimicry, Subjectivity, and the Embodied Voice in Anglo-Saxon Bird Riddles', in Voice and Voicelessness in Medieval Europe, ed. by Irit Ruth Kleiman (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), pp. 29-43 (p. 32), doi:10.1007/978-1-137-39706-5_3. It is clear for metrical reasons that the runes were supposed to be sounded by their names, which are also words in their own right, so that in a sense the translation should also be something like: where I sit cheerful. 'Gift' name me, also 'ash-tree' and 'ride'. 'Pagan god[?]' helps, 'hail' and 'ice'. Now I am named as the six letters clearly signify. Interpretation The riddles alludes to the jay's proclivity for imitating other species, and it has been argued that the poem's soundplay also reflects this.Robert Stanton, 'Mimicry, Subjectivity, and the Embodied Voice in Anglo-Saxon Bird Riddles', in Voice and Voicelessness in Medieval Europe, ed. by Irit Ruth Kleiman (Palgrave Macmillan, 2015), pp. 29-43 (pp. 32-33), doi:10.1007/978-1-137-39706-5_3.

It was established in 1879. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The Zero Obelisk marks the beginning of the first official survey of the border between the colonies of Queensland and New South Wales in 1879-80.  History  =Surveyors= The need for an official survey of the border had been recognised for many years but the work was not begun until mid 1879, when officers from both colonies met at the telegraph station at Barringun in New South Wales which was close to the border (Latitude 29¬∞S). The surveyors were JB Cameron and J Conder, Trigonometrical Surveyors, from New South Wales and GC Watson, Surveying Commissioner of Crown Lands, Warrego District, from Queensland. John Brewer Cameron was born in Scotland and immigrated to Victoria with his family in 1853. Noted for being athletic and adventurous, he travelled first to the Victorian goldfields and then to New Zealand. Returning to Victoria, he joined a government geodetic surveying party working in the area near Mount Baw Baw. This experience led him to decide to take up a career in surveying. He went to Fiji as a surveyor in 1869, then returned in 1872 to Victoria where he specialised in surveying and geodesy. By 1879 he was a First Class surveyor in the Trigonometrical branch of the New South Wales Lands Department and a member of the Royal Geographical Society of New South Wales. In this year he undertook his most notable commission, to survey the border between Queensland and New South Wales. =Survey= The survey work began at Zero Obelisk at Barringun, the division of work between the surveyors being described by Cameron in a letter to his uncle, Ewen Cameron: > Mr Watson is responsible for chainage while I am for the astronomical > portion in finding true meridian, giving true bearing, setting off the > chords, and finding latitude at every convenient site. After observations at Barringun to determine the latitude, the team began surveying the border in a westerly direction to the intersection with the border with South Australia at Longitude 141¬∞ E, known as Cameron's Corner. This was a distance of over difficult country. Watson and Cameron did not get on and they had to contend first with flooding in both the Warrego and Paroo systems and then drought. Health problems and shortages of both food and water added to their problems. Watson withdrew at the one hundred mile post due to lack of water, but Cameron was determined to carry on. This section of the survey took 12 months and 15 days to complete and details of it were given in the first Annual Report of the NSW Department of Lands 1880 Appendix 1. In 1881, Cameron returned to Barringun to survey the easterly section to the Barwon River. This 200 mile survey was easier with good water and grass available throughout. When the survey was complete Cameron commemorated the event by placing a wooden post carved with his name on the river bank (Cameron's 1 Ton Survey Post). Although this was not the first border survey, it was the official survey. In 1883, Cameron moved to New Guinea where he carried out important surveys under the direction of Sir William MacGregor. He died on 30 December 1897 in Brisbane during a return trip to New Guinea and is buried in the Toowong Cemetery.  Description  The Zero Obelisk at Barringun is a truncated pyramid of concrete render over stone, measuring marking the Queensland - New South Wales border at Barringun. Part of an inscription on the Queensland side which reads \\"G. WAT\\" (George Chale Watson) is still visible.  Heritage listing  Zero Obelisk was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Zero Obelisk, Barringun marks the first official survey of the border between what were then the separate colonies of New South Wales and Queensland when an accurate definition of the border was important for legal and economic reasons. It illustrates a remarkable feat of surveying in the nineteenth century and is a reminder of the extraordinarily difficult conditions under which many early surveyors worked. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Zero Obelisk is one of the few extant physical reminders of the official survey undertaking to mark the Queensland - New South Wales border. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. As a commemoration of one of his most notable accomplishments, the obelisk has an important association with the life and career of JB Cameron and other surveyors, whose work contributed to the development of Australia.

History Up to, and including State President Charles Robberts Swart's term of office, no permanent Guard existed. On his retirement from office on 31 May 1967, plans were made for the Guard to appear in public for the first time. The Unit was established officially on 1 May 1967 and an effort was made to train the specially selected servicemen who would form this guard of honour. Special uniforms were manufactured. Due to the State President elect's illness, the Guard could only make its first public appearance eight months later at his State funeral. President P. W. Botha changed the name of the unit to the \\"State President's Unit\\" in 1985, and later the ceremonial uniform was changed to the regular service uniform used by the rest of the defense forces. =Replaced= President F. W. de Klerk disbanded the unit in 1990. President Mandela in the late 1990s, replaced the unit with the National Ceremonial Guard in the SANDF. Function =Ceremonial= The most important ceremonial function of the State President's Guard was that of guard of honour. Appearances of the Guard in this capacity included the following: * the inauguration of State Presidents; *leftvisits from foreign heads of State, as well as other eminent foreign visitors; * performances at the state funerals of State Presidents and at certain other military funerals. Regular performances also took place at occasions when foreign ambassadors presented their credentials to the State President. Other appearances were when national states officially gain independence. In addition, the Guard also performed at the official arrival and departure of the State President from various cities, especially those cities in which his official residences were situated. The Unit was also responsible for a weekly changing of the guard parade on Fridays at Tuynhuys in Cape Town while Parliament was in session. At the end of each month, a retreat ceremony was held by the Unit at a public venue. Similar parades were held at the Castle, the Parade in Cape Town and at the Union Buildings in Pretoria. General Constand Viljoen and P.W.

Consequently, the training of the Unit was quite diverse and intensive and the requirements for selection were very strict. Infantry Unit Each soldier had to undergo strict physical and psychological selection. State presidents guard's training included bush warfare, VIP training and service (State president, Generals and Ministers), urban terrorism and unarmed combat. The SP guards were also used for covert intelligence operations. Weapons training included; R1 (battle rifle based on Belgian design), R4 assault rifle (Gallil), 89 mm rocket launcher, m20 replacement, phosphorus grenades , Mikor grenades, landmines, shotgun, pistols, Beretta 92, Star, UZI, Ak47, M18 \\"pineapple\\" mines, M3, M1/M2, 81 mm mortars, Amsel striker, Amscor M963 grenades, Milan ER antintank missile, Mecar anti tank grenades, RPG 7 anti tank, FN Mag machine gun .

In 2015, he was honoured with lifetime achievement award by Retail Jewellers India for his contribution & success in the industry of luxury goods and his contribution to the betterment of society in Surat and throughout the State of Gujarat. Career After moving to the city of Surat from his hometown, Ugamedi Laljibhai patel initially began his career as a trader in diamonds & soon gathered thorough knowledge of industry. Later, in 1985, along with Tulsibhai Goti, his childhood friend, Laljibhai founded a small diamond manufacturing unit named Shreeji Gems. The company grew & in 1993, it was registered as a partnership firm and renamed to Dharmanandan Diamonds.

The company is De Beers Sightholder and manufacture polished diamonds in all shapes & sizes. Personal life Laljibhai was born at Ugamedi, a village in Bhavnagar district & in the state of Gujarat, India, to a farmer family. He moved to Rajkot to complete his secondary school. He studied at Gurukul, Rajkot where he befriended with his current business associate, Tulsibhai Goti. Laljibhai married to Nirmalaben and the couple has two sons, Hitesh Patel & Piyush Patel, both of whom are now looking after Dharmanandan Diamonds. Social Work Laljibhai has also took the task of addressing various issues of female foeticide, water conservation, education, health, and social illiteracy in to his own hands for the betterment of the State of Gujarat. =Save the Girl Child Mega Campaign= Under the presidency of Laljibhai, Samast Patidar Samajhttp://www.spstrust.com/Activities.html#savegirl has planned Maha Laddu Beti Bachao Abhiyan. To encourage people to participate with empathy in this movement, handful of grains and a glass of water were collected from 2,35,000 households to create a gigantic bundi laddu of 300,000 kilogram with the diameter of 65 feet and 35 feet of height. Moreover, with an appeal to stop female foeticide and cultivate the attitude of equality towards girl child, 170,000 6-page informative booklets were distributed throughout the state. On 1 January 2006, Surat witnessed a massive gathering of 1.2 Million people from entire Gujarat who took oath that we will never do female foeticide and prevent others doing the same. Limca Book of Records has proudly acknowledged this program.http://saujaldharatrust.com/?page_id=1274 This vast movement helped improve gender ratio in Gujarat at 890 girls to 1000 boys in contrast to 761 girls in year 2006 and has created psychological change, people start believing that girls are in no way less than boys. The discrimination is reduced to the level that people started celebrating birth of girl child as same as they do for the birth of boy child. =River Linking & Rainwater Conservation= Growing up as a farmer's son, Laljibhai has always been concerned about rainwater conservation. He knew how uncertain rain affect annual crop yield. To resolve this, water conservation at very large capacity was necessary. To start in that direction, in his native village Ugamedi in Botad district of Gujarat, he dug 3 ponds of 3.5 km in length, up to 45 feet of depth & 400 feet of width that can store nearly 2.5 crore litres of fresh water, making them largest artificial ponds in Gujarat. The village river Sonal supposed to fill these ponds, however during following weak monsoon it was seen that these huge ponds could not be filled with river Sonal alone. After pondering over the condition he analyzed that there is another river Keri 2.5 kilometre away from village.

He was celebrated for shooting down a Zeppelin R Class airship over Potters Bar in October 1916. Early life and family background Wulstan Tempest was born in Ackworth, Yorkshire, in 1891. He was the ninth child, and the sixth son, of Wilfrid Francis Tempest, a member of the notable recusant Tempest family, and his second wife Florence Helen O'Rourke (Wilfrid had a total of 15 children from two marriages). He was a descendant of George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, the great-grandson of King Edward III. His father was a wealthy landowner and justice of the peace, serving as Chairman of the West Riding Bench for the Pontefract Division. Tempest was educated at Stonyhurst College, where he won distinction in mathematics, then spent three years training for the merchant service at HMS Worcester. He worked as a mining engineer, and spent a few months as a sugar farmer in South Africa, before moving to Canada in 1911 with his brother Edmund to farm in Perdue, Saskatchewan, but they returned to England to enlist in October 1914. World War I Tempest was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, with seniority from 30 November 1914. His battalion was sent to France in May 1915, where he saw action during the Second Battle of Ypres in April, which marked the first large-scale use by the Germans of chlorine gas on the Western Front. Suffering from the effects of gassing Tempest was invalided home to recuperate. He returned to his battalion in July, but was then transferred to a garrison battalion based at Newcastle. In early 1916 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps to train as a pilot, receiving his Royal Aero Club Aviators Certificate in April, and on 17 June he was appointed a flying officer in the RFC, and transferred to the General List. =Shooting down a Zeppelin= Tempest was posted to No. 39 (Home Defence) Squadron. This unit was based at RFC North Weald in Essex, and flew a mixture of B.E.2 and B.E.12 aircraft. It was specifically formed to defend London from German air raids, and had several successes. On 2/3 September 1916, Lieutenant Leefe Robinson destroyed SL.11, becoming the first British pilot to bring down a German airship, and winning the Victoria Cross. On 23/24 September Second Lieutenant Frederick Sowrey destroyed Zeppelin L.32, which crashed in flames at Billericay, and Second Lieutenant Alfred Brandon damaged Zeppelin L.33 sufficiently for her crew to make a forced landing at Little Wigborough, and set her on fire. At 23:45 on 1 October 1916, Tempest was on patrol about over South-West London flying B.E.2c night fighter, serial number \\"4557\\", having taken off from North Weald around 22:00. Meanwhile, Zeppelin L.31, commanded by Kapit√§nleutnant Heinrich Mathy had flown across the North Sea, and crossed the English coast at Lowestoft, but was unable to penetrate London's defences, coming under heavy anti-aircraft fire. L.31 dropped most of her bombs over Cheshunt, but was then captured by searchlights. Tempest spotted the airship in the distance and immediately set a course to intercept her. As he approached his fuel tank pressure pump failed, and he was forced to use the hand pump to keep his engine operating. He eventually closed with the airship, running the gauntlet of anti-aircraft fire. Approaching from the bows he fired a burst into her, then dived underneath firing another burst, seeing his incendiary bullets ripping through the airship's fabric skin, before turning to make another pass from the tail. He momentarily saw a red glow illuminate the Zeppelin from within \\"like an enormous Chinese lantern\\" before flames erupted from the bows. Tempest span away to avoid being hit by flames and debris as the airship plunged to the ground, crashing at Potters Bar. Exhausted by his exertions and the bitter cold Tempest crashed his aircraft on landing, cracking his skull against the butt of his machine gun. The next day he travelled to Potters Bar to survey the wreck of L.31, but the area was cordoned off by the Army, and he was obliged to pay a shilling to see the wreckage from an adjoining farm. Two weeks later, on 13 October Tempest was made a companion of the Distinguished Service Order, \\"...in recognition of conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in connection with the destruction of an Enemy Airship.\\" His portrait appears on a postcard, titled Three Zepp. Wreckers (William Leefe Robinson; Wulstan Joseph Tempest; Frederick Sowrey), in a portrait photograph for the Rotary Photographic Co. Ltd., taken in late 1916. =Later war service= On 25 January 1917 Tempest was mentioned in despatches \\"...for distinguished services rendered in connection with the War\\". In February 1917 he was transferred to the newly formed No. 100 Squadron RFC, a bomber squadron flying a mixture of F.E.2b and B.E.2e aircraft, and on 1 March he was promoted to lieutenant. The squadron soon crossed to France, flying its first mission on the night of 5/6 April, attacking Douai aerodrome. That summer the squadron saw action during the battles of Vimy Ridge, Arras, Messines, and third Ypres, gaining a reputation for energy and efficiency, while on 27 June Tempest was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain. On 18 October Tempest was awarded the Military Cross. His citation, gazetted on 5 March 1918, read: :Temporary Second Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Wulstan Joseph Tempest, DSO, General List and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty on many occasions. He has successfully bombed railway sidings and aerodromes, often in misty and cloudy weather, and at a low altitude, causing much damage to his objectives. On one occasion he descended to a very low altitude and dropped bombs on two moving trains, causing them both to be derailed. This officer has taken part in thirty-four night bombing raids.\\" The same month his squadron become part of the Independent Air Force, and was relocated to Ochey aerodrome to fly strategic bombing missions over Germany, attacking munitions factories in the Rhine towns. On 15 December 1917 Tempest was appointed squadron commander with the temporary rank of major, taking command of his squadron. In March 1918, during the German Spring Offensive, No. 100 Squadron was temporarily moved to an aerodrome near Rheims, flying tactical missions against German lines of communication, before returning to Ochey and the Independent Air Force. In June, Tempest handed over command of No. 100 Squadron to Major C. Gordon Burge. In July 1918 Tempest took command of No. 36 Squadron, a training unit flying the Sopwith Pup and Bristol F.2 fighters, based at RAF Usworth near Sunderland. From January 1919 until March 1919 he commanded No. 101 Squadron, a night bomber unit flying the F.E.2b, based in France and Belgium. He was transferred to the RAF unemployed list on 1 August 1919. Personal life Of his brothers, Major Wilfred Norman Tempest, 2nd Battalion (attached 9th Battalion), King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, was killed in action on 26 September 1916, and is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial. Flight Lieutenant Edmund Roger Tempest, also served in the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry before transferring to the RFC, and was credited with 17 aircraft shot down while serving in No. 64 Squadron. He was killed in a flying accident in 1921. In May 1919 Tempest became engaged to Camille Millicent Best, of Brussels, but eventually married Ethel Fernandes on 5 April 1923 at All Saints' Church, Ennismore Gardens, London. Tempest died in 1966, and is commemorated in the names of two streets in Potters Bar near Oakmere Park, \\"Tempest Avenue\\" and \\"Wulstan Park\\", close to where the L.31 crashed. Memorial service On 1 October 2016 the 100th anniversary of the shooting down of L.31 was marked by a memorial service with a fly-past by a replica B.E.2c aircraft, and wreaths were laid by the Mayor of Hertsmere and the German Air Attach√© in memory of the nineteen German crewmen who were killed.

It was selected to be screened in the Discovery section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on Netflix worldwide on September 16, 2016. Robbie Amell plays an engineer whose invention causes a time loop during a home invasion. He attempts to save his former lover, played by Rachael Taylor, while learning who has targeted him and why. Plot Renton wakes up beside his former lover, Hannah. Three men break into his bedroom and, when Renton breaks his neck while escaping, he wakes with a start where he was just a moment earlier. The men break in once again and bind him and Hannah to chairs in another room. Their leader, Father, says he represents a rebel group known as the Bloc and demands Renton surrender money or \\"scrips\\" that he had stolen from their rival organization, the Torus Corporation. Father and the two other men, Sonny and Brother, leave to eat in another room and Renton is able to cut himself and Hannah loose. He explains that he built the ARQ, a working perpetual motion machine, while working for Torus and then stole the machine. Hannah urges him to comply with the men, but he tries to escape and dies. He wakes with a start back in bed with Hannah, only to relive the same scenario. This time, after freeing the two of them, he asks Hannah to help poison the intruders with cyanide gas. The plan fails when Hannah reveals that she is a member of the Bloc. Renton surrenders the scrips and then Sonny shoots him. In the next iteration, Renton questions Hannah about her past before freeing her. She admits that she grew to resent him after he abandoned her to Torus, who tortured her. Though he does not trust Hannah, Renton and Hannah work out a deal where they will split the scrips after using the cyanide gas to force Father and his group to stand down. Once they have the three men captured, though, Renton reneges on the deal, demanding that Hannah abandon the Bloc and come with him. Hannah accidentally shoots Renton in an ensuing scuffle. When Renton and Hannah wake up together, she can now recall the previous iteration. Renton theorizes that the ARQ is causing a time loop. He also realizes that the ARQ does not function as a perpetual motion machine, but in fact generates the time loop as a way to continue using the energy from the gasoline used to catalyze the process, making it seem as if it is generating endless energy. Eventually, Sonny reveals himself as a Torus mercenary and kills everyone. Renton and Hannah agree in the next iteration that they must keep the ARQ from Torus. They convince Father to help them stop Sonny but, once they do, Brother shoots Renton, not realizing that Sonny works for Torus. In the next iteration, Sonny becomes aware of the time loop and immediately kills Father and Brother. When Sonny overpowers them, Renton sacrifices himself to prevent Sonny from acquiring the ARQ. In the next iteration, Sonny saves Cuz's life, then kills Father and Brother. Renton and Hannah poison Sonny and Cuz with the cyanide. Before dying, Sonny sets a trap that kills Hannah, prompting Renton to allow the next iteration to begin. Everyone is now aware of the time loop, and Sonny and Cuz take everyone hostage. After Sonny forces Renton to disable the machine, Father and Brother die in the confusion of a blackout. Renton and Hannah briefly escape and realize the time loop is localized to the house. Renton decides to go back inside to destroy the machine and Hannah goes back with him. After they kill Cuz, who turns out to have been Hannah's torturer, Sonny restarts the ARQ, only to be killed himself. An interrupted video message and the ARQ's logs reveal a second, outer time loop: after every nine time loops, all of their memories are reset. They have unknowingly repeated the same nine loops thousands of times. Realizing they are on their ninth loop, Renton and Hannah leave a desperate message to themselves, hoping future iterations can get the ARQ to the Bloc before Torus's reinforcements arrive. After a robot breaks through and kills them, Hannah wakes with a gasp. Cast Production The concept dates back to 2008, prior to writer- director Tony Elliot's work on the television series Orphan Black; the show's creators hired him based on his unproduced script. The script had been optioned but remained in development hell for years. After the rights reverted to Elliott, Netflix contacted his producer and offered to produce it. In January 2016, it was announced that Netflix would produce and distribute the film. Mason Novick, John Finemore, Kyle Franke, and Nick Spicer produced the film under their Lost City and XYZ Films banner. That same month, it was announced that Robbie Amell and Rachael Taylor had been cast in the film. Shooting took place in Toronto over 19 days. Elliott quoted the budget at \\"under $2 million\\". Release The film had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2016. The film was released on September 16, 2016. Reception John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"tricky little time twister that makes the most of its limited resources\\", comparing it to Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow in its concept. DeFore wrote that the film throws many new wrinkles into its looping plot, causing viewers to eventually stop trying to predict characters' actions. Of the film's climax, DeFore said, \\"Amazingly, given how many time-travel pix collapse in a tangle of logic around this point, ARQ knows how to wrap its paradoxes up in a way we can hardly criticize.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes ARQ holds a 43% rating with critics, after seven reviews.

Family  Vranje≈°eviƒá was born in the village of Rekavice near Banja Luka, in the north of the Austro- Hungarian Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which became part of Yugoslavia the same year. Her family, noted for its teachers and priests, originated from Krupa na Vrbasu. She was a daughter of ƒêorƒëe Vranje≈°eviƒá, a priest of the Serbian Orthodox Church and an active member of the Agrarian Party, with whom she was very close. Her conservative mother, Anƒëa, was the sister of Branko Zagorac, who had been sentenced to three years of prison for his part in the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. Rada and her older sister Nevenka (later a teacher) were greatly influenced by their uncle's leftist ideas; other siblings were a younger sister named Ljuba (a dental technician) and a brother who drowned in the Vrbas river.  Education  Vranje≈°eviƒá attended primary school in a village near Prnjavor, and gymnasium in Derventa and Banja Luka. She aspired to become a teacher but was expelled in 1932 due to her affiliation with the outlawed Communist Party. In 1933, she enrolled a merchants' academy and joined a Communist youth organization, but was considered too young and physically frail to take part in its activities. This nevertheless again led to expulsion from school. By this time she was romantically involved with the Muslim journalist Safet Filipoviƒá, who too was a Communist sympathizer. Such inter- ethnic romance was \\"unusual and bold\\" at the time, but Vranje≈°eviƒá succeeded in winning her clerical family's approval for both their relationship and political activities. From 1936 until 1937 she attended school in Skopje, and grew very fond of Macedonia and its people. Taking interest in the Macedonian Question along with her peers, Vranje≈°eviƒá was a vocal supporter of Macedonian nationalism, although she only spoke Serbian (with an \\"amusing Bosnian accent\\").  Second World War  Vranje≈°eviƒá was unable to find employment after finishing the merchants' academy, and moved back in with her parents near Prnjavor. In 1939 she started working in Belgrade, and was thrilled to start an independent life in the Yugoslav capital. She and her boyfriend, Safet Filipoviƒá, lived together in a small studio apartment. Vranje≈°eviƒá immediately took part in the activities of the Communist Party, which she officially joined in 1940. She was arrested the same year after organizing a strike action and released only due to intervention of the government minister Branko ƒåubriloviƒá, her father's acquaintance. Having lost her job, Vranje≈°eviƒá was urged by her parents to return to Bosnia, but she refused. Instead she took up campaigning in Montenegro on behalf of the Party. In April 1941, Yugoslavia was swiftly overrun by Axis forces. The Independent State of Croatia, a fascist puppet state, was set up on the territory of Croatia, Slavonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its racial policy led to a widespread persecution of Serbs. Vranje≈°eviƒá went to Banja Luka after the bombing of Belgrade, but soon returned. She and Filipoviƒá left Belgrade together and returned to Banja Luka on 1 May, where she entered the Partisan resistance movement. Filipoviƒá was arrested and sent to Danica concentration camp in late June, and in early July Vranje≈°eviƒá's parents and sister Ljuba were deported to Serbia. Vranje≈°eviƒá took up wearing niqƒÅb and was sheltered by Vahida Maglajliƒá, a prominent Banja Luka Muslim whose house served as supply store and shelter for Partisan fighters. Vranje≈°eviƒá was successful in recruiting Banja Luka women to the Partisan cause. The Communist Party decided that Vranje≈°eviƒá should go to the free territory surrounding the Grmeƒç mountain. Maglajliƒá organized the transfer, and the veiled Vranje≈°eviƒá left in September. She later used the veil to conceal sanitary material and ammunition. In November 1942, Vranje≈°eviƒá was elected member of the Regional Committee of the Communist Party in Bosanska Krajina. She was among the founding members of the Women's Antifascist Front of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later became member of the Central Committee of the Women's Antifascist Front of Yugoslavia. Vranje≈°eviƒá was one of only four women, among 170 delegates, to take part in the State Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) in Mrkonjiƒá Grad on 25 November 1943.  Death  In the spring of 1944, Vranje≈°eviƒá was sent by the Party to work in the western Bosnian town of Drvar. Nazi Germany launched a raid on Drvar on 25 May, Vranje≈°eviƒá's 26th birthday, and she was captured by the paratroopers. She was killed in an attempt to escape the next day. Following the liberation of Yugoslavia, Vranje≈°eviƒá's remains were transferred to the Partisan cemetery in Banja Luka. On 27 July 1951, Vranje≈°eviƒá was declared a People's Hero of Yugoslavia.

It was built in 1918 by Wunderlich. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Paroo Honour Board commemorates those from Paroo Shire who served in World War I and was unveiled in 1918 by the then Queensland Governor, Sir Hamilton John Goold-Adams. It was originally located in the old Paroo Shire Hall, but is now in the current Civic Centre. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead, but also those who fought and returned. Australians were proud that their first great national army was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they paid the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Many communities honoured their volunteers after the war ended, but the Paroo board is early and was installed before the close of hostilities. It has the date of the commencement of the war, 1914, on the left hand side of the memorial, but the corresponding space on the other side is empty. Spaces have also been left for names to be added. The design selected is a handsome, but standard type of Wunderlich honour board found in a number of other towns in Queensland. It commemorates all those from Paroo Shire who served in World War I, the dead not being indicated in any way. Beneath the standard words \\"Roll of Honor\\" and British and Australian flags is a plaque on which \\"Paroo Shire\\" is encircled by the commemorative inscriptions \\"Brave hearts and true, God guide them\\" and \\"Shall their sacrifice be in vain?\\" This is an uncommon challenge; a more usual inscription on similar Wunderlich honour boards is 'Those who answered the Empire's call'. The Honour Board was relocated to the public foyer of the new Civic Centre in 1971. This was officially opened by the then Queensland Premier, Hon Joh Bjelke-Petersen on 23 April 1971.  Description  The Paroo Honour Board is a panel of pressed copper; richly decorated in low relief with patriotic symbols such as flags, laurel wreaths and cannons. This decoration provides a rich frame for columns of names, each on an individual brass strip. The honour board is mounted on a marble slab, measuring , which is in turn mounted on a wooden frame with a bronze edge trim. A total of 370 names of those who served in World War I are listed alphabetically with further spaces indicating that hostilities had not yet ceased at that time. In the tradition of memorials, the rank of the deceased is not indicated.  Heritage listing  Close-up of the Paroo Shire Honour Board, 1997 Paroo Shire Honour Board was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. War memorials, including honour boards, especially those dating from the Boer and First World Wars, are a local tribute to war dead and are an important element of Queensland towns and cities. They represent a conscious expression of emerging Australian nationhood and reflect public taste and social attitudes of their time. Such memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It has an unusual inscription that has not been found on another honour board in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The memorials manifest a unique documentary record and are demonstrative of popular taste in the inter-war period.

Research  He has three broad areas of interest: 1) Typology. He works on the typology of features, as in Gender (1991), Number (2000), Agreement (2006) and Features (2012), all with Cambridge University Press. Recently, with several colleagues, he has been developing the canonical approach to typology. Within that approach he has papers in Language, on suppletion (2007) and on lexical splits (2015). For some years he has been developing the Canonical Typology framework, which has expanded beyond its original heartland of morphology and syntax to include work in phonology and sign language. 2) Morphosyntactic features. Number, gender, person and case all offer interesting challenges. 3) Inflectional Morphology (especially Network Morphology) the European Research Council funded project Morphological Complexity which examined the ways in which morphological structure introduces complexity which has no apparent function outside this component. Corbett's resulting research on the typology of splits in paradigms has appeared in Language. His most recent work is on conditions on inflection, the generalizations which cross-cut the generalizations provided by inflection classes, and concerned with the practical issue of how inflectional material is represented in a transparent and comprehensible way.

Life  M. Margaret Clark was born on January 9, 1925 in Amarillo, Texas. After receiving a doctorate degree in anthropology from University of California, Berkeley, she was employed by the U.S. Public Health Service as a researcher, where she worked on public health-related projects in Colorado. She also worked as a consultant for various agencies directed towards health and aging. Dr. Clark later earned a Professor Emerita position at University of California, San Francisco where she taught medical anthropology through a joint graduate program she created. She retired from her position in 1991, after which she took courses at the Fromm Institute at the University of San Francisco. Dr. Clark died of a heart attack on January 23, 2003. She was living in San Rafael, California, at the time of her death at 78 years old. = Positions = Throughout her career, Clark served in various societies and associations, including the following: * President of the Society for Medical Anthropology(1972‚Äì1973) * Vice president (1974‚Äì1975) and Executive Councillor (1973‚Äì1976) for the Gerontological Society of America * Executive Board member of the Society for Applied Anthropology (1974‚Äì1977) * Section H Executive Committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science(1977‚Äì1981) * President (1981‚Äì1982) and Executive Board member (1974‚Äì1977) of the American Anthropological Association * Member of International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences  Education  Clark earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Southern Methodist University, and entered Southwestern Medical School at the age of 20. After three years of medical school, she left to pursue anthropology as a graduate student at UC Berkeley. Clark completed her doctorate in anthropology in 1957 at Berkeley under the advisement of George Foster. Her dissertation was ‚ÄúSickness and health in Sal si Puedes; Mexican-Americans in a California community,‚Äù which she completed in San Jose, California on the community Sal si Puedes and was published in 1959.  Research  In her research, Clark explores the effects of cultural practices through experiments, field studies, interviews, and literature on oral traditions. Her book, Health in the Mexican-American Culture: A Community Study, focuses on the socio-cultural constructs of the Sal si Puedes group and their aversion and mistrust towards modern health practices. The work concludes with recommendations to social workers on how to engage with such groups in light of their beliefs. Another of Clark's books, Culture and Aging: An Anthropological Study of Older Americans, reveals the decline in status of aging Americans as their children trend away from home. This book presents suggestions for medical professionals and policymakers about the aging population. In The Anthropology of Aging, a New Area for Studies of Culture and Personality, Clark demonstrates that humans are dynamic creatures and as a result their personalities change throughout their entire lifetime. In her paper The Cultural Context of Medical Practice, Clark identifies the difficulty of meeting the needs of all cultures due to the variation around the beliefs towards medical practices. In Explorations of Acculturation: Toward A Model of Ethnic Identity,Clark explores the relationship between acculturation and ethnic identity, identifies the importance of personal choice, generation of residence and other influencing factors, and derives six types of bicultural life based on a sample of three generations from two ethnic minority groups. Her list of published works includes: * Health in the Mexican-American Culture; a community study * Culture and Aging: An Anthropological Study of Older Adults * The Anthropology of Aging, a New Area for Studies of Culture and Personality * Explorations of Acculturation: Toward A Model of Ethnic Identity * The Cultural Context of Medical Practice * A ‚ÄúBootstrap‚Äù Scaling Technique * The Cultural Patterning of Risk-Seeking Behavior  Legacy  Clark revolutionized the field of anthropology by being one of the first to emphasize the importance of social and cultural background in health and medicine. She used this innovative socio-cultural analysis to create what now is the Department of Anthropology, History and Social Medicine at UCSF. Clark also co-founded the Medical Anthropology Training Program as part of a joint program between UCSF and UC Berkeley in 1975 and established the UCSF Multidisciplinary Training Program in Applied Gerontology in 1976. In 1980, she was the first woman and first social scientist to be named as a Faculty Research Lecturer by UCSF. She also received the Distinguished Membership Award of the Gerontological Society of America in 1989 and the Malinowski Award of the Society for Applied Anthropology in 1992. The Association of Anthropology, Gerontology and the Life Course created the annual ‚ÄúMargaret Clark Award‚Äù in 1994 to honor her commitment to mentoring younger colleagues. The award is given to the best graduate and undergraduate papers relating to anthropology and gerontology. The UCSF Department of Anthropology, History & Social Medicine created the M. Margaret Clark Memorial Fund in her honor at the time of her death in 2003, with the goal of inspiring and training future generations of medical anthropologists. UCSF began expanding the fund in 2014 to integrate new aspects, such as the annual M. Margaret Clark Memorial Lecture, in order to promote her quest for a cultural understanding of the development and practices of health and medicine.

It premiered on February 1, 2013, when it was released along with the rest of the first season on the American streaming service Netflix. Plot Frank (Kevin Spacey) is in the middle of negotiating the education bill with Marty Spinella (Al Sapienza), head of a teacher's union, when he learns that a 17-year-old girl has been killed due to texting while driving in his hometown of Gaffney, South Carolina, while being distracted by the Peachoid, a water tower shaped like a peach that Frank had advocated to keep standing. County administrator Oren Chase (Murphy Guyer), a Republican rival of Frank who wants his congressional seat, urges the girl's parents to file a lawsuit against him. Despite Linda (Sakina Jaffrey) and Spinella's protests, Frank leaves for Gaffney. There, he meets the girl's parents and delivers a eulogy at her funeral, offering a settlement of $150,000 and promising to sponsor billboards warning against texting while driving. When the parents don't seem satisfied, he asks Reverend Jenkins (Bill Phillips) to arrange morning's service to give him the pulpit. Meanwhile, Claire (Robin Wright) tries to recruit Gillian Cole (Sandrine Holt), who owns her own organization WorldWell but is refused. Unfazed, Claire follows Gillian home and, noting that she can't afford treatment for her chronic illness, promises her health insurance. Zoe (Kate Mara) makes numerous media appearances as a result of her leak of Durant's (Jayne Atkinson) nomination for Secretary of State. Her off-the-cuff comments during interviews lead to a rift with Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver), who grounds her for a month. Russo (Corey Stoll) starts making efforts to put his life back in order to maintain his relationship with Christina (Kristen Connolly), who is considering taking a job with the Speaker of the House. He gets rid of all his drug stash and tells Christina that he doesn't want her to leave. In South Carolina, Frank continues negotiating the education bill via conference call. After phoning Claire, Frank sends flirtatious texts to Zoe, leading to intimate conversations. During the mourning service he demonstrates how his oratory skills helped him rise in Washington, and gives a passionate old- school sermon around the \\"idea of hate\\", going so far as to yell \\"I hate you, God\\" in front of a South Carolina congregation. He's then able to connect to the parishioners by making them equals, saying they've all done this before when feeling soul-crushing loss, and two among them are feeling that today. Frank invites the dead girl's parents to lunch, where discussions get heated, with Underwood asking them if they want him to resign. He ends up on good terms with them, announcing a Furman Scholarship in their daughter's honor. In order to take Oren down, he finds out that the responsibility for guardrails is the county's‚Äîbut none have been built. Along with the mayor, Frank visits Oren, and confronts him with that responsibility: \\"if there were guardrails the car wouldn't flip three times and the county administrator didn't build those guardrails and now she's dead.\\" He also tells Oren that the planned power lines that the mayor has blocked because they would fall on Oren's property can go up this year if he claims it as \\"eminent domain\\".

XXI (Preface) or on an earlier model for the middle movements of the concerto and the organ sonata.Dirksen 2010, p. 22 (Introduction) Regarding the origin of the models for BWV 1044, BWV 894 was copied by Johann Bernhard Bach the Younger between 1707 and 1715 and by Johann Tobias Krebs from 1710 to 1717.D-LEb Peters Ms. R 9 (Depositum im Bach-Archiv) and D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 801, Fascicle 4 at Bach Digital website Although their copies of the composition survive, neither is its earliest known version; an earlier reading of BWV 894 is found in copies by Johann Peter Kellner (1725) and Johann Nikolaus Mempell (mid-18th century).D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 804, Fascicle 29 and D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 1084 at Bach Digital website In 1970 Hans Eppstein argued that the lost model for BWV 894 may have been a keyboard concerto, but this cannot be demonstrated conclusively. The middle movement of the Third Sonata (BWV 527/2) was based on an earlier model which predated the earliest version of the sonata's first movement, probably composed during the 1720s. Dietrich Kilian, editor of the New Bach Edition volume which contains the Triple Concerto, assumes that Bach composed the concerto after 1726 (most likely in his later years).Kilian 1986, p. 105ff.; Kilian 1989, p. 43ff.BWV2a (1998) p. 425 Movements and scoring Bach scored the concerto for the same instruments as his fifth Brandenburg Concerto, BWV 1050, with the addition of a second violino di ripieno part.

History  Although the Warrego River district in southwest Queensland was explored briefly by Thomas Mitchell in 1846 and Edmund Kennedy in 1847, the main impetus for pastoral development of the Warrego occurred in the 1860s, following William Landsborough's exploration of the area in 1862 during his search for the ill-fated Burke and Wills expedition. In 1862 Landsborough and his second in command, George Bourne, both published journals of their expedition from the Gulf of Carpentaria south to Melbourne, identifying good pastoral land along the Warrego River. In 1867 a petition was presented to the Queensland Parliament seeking the establishment of a town reserve at the intersection of two main stock routes beside the Warrego River, and the township of Cunnamulla was surveyed the same year. The name is thought to be an Aboriginal term meaning \\"long stretch of water\\". By 1871 Cunnamulla had a population of 45. The town grew slowly in the 1870s, gaining momentum toward the end of the decade. A court house reserve was surveyed in 1874, and the 1874 Postal Directory lists a police magistrate who also conducted the court of petty sessions, a police inspector, a post master and a poundkeeper. A branch of the Queensland Government Savings Bank also operated by this date. The Cunnamulla State School was established in 1878, and in 1879 the Paroo Divisional Board, based at Cunnamulla, was proclaimed. The period 1880 to 1900 was one of consolidation for the town, which became the service centre for an expanding pastoral district. Cobb & Co began to run passenger coaches from Charleville to Cunnamulla in 1881, and gained the mail contract in 1883. By 1881 two banks were operating in the town, the Queensland National Bank established by January 1880, and the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, opened in 1880. The town became a railhead in the late 1890s when the Western railway line arrived in the town from Charleville. In 1880 an incident occurred that provided the township of Cunnamulla with considerable publicity. On 16 January 1880 Joseph Wells, a station hand, robbed the Queensland National Bank at Cunnamulla at gunpoint. The alarm was raised and as Wells was about to leave the bank, storekeeper William Murphy from next door attempted to restrain him and in the scuffle, was shot accidentally in the shoulder. This allowed Wells to escape from the bank, only to find that a crowd of onlookers was gathering outside. As he tried to leave the scene on horseback, the horse's bridle broke and, in desperation, the robber ran toward the outskirts of the town. Amongst the crowd of onlookers were two men with unloaded guns, who gave chase. Turning on them and threatening to shoot if they didn't retreat, Wells ran into the bush. The police were alerted and organised an intensive search for the robber, who may have escaped detection but for the persistence of a sheep dog which had followed Wells' scent and sat barking under a tree. On investigating, the local police sergeant discovered that Wells had taken refuge in the branches of the tree, where he was well camouflaged. Wells was arrested and stood trial in Toowoomba, charged with armed robbery with wounding. He was found guilty and received the maximum penalty, death. Because of the accidental nature of Murphy's wounding and the fact that Wells had not had legal representation during his trial, opponents of capital punishment, including several Members of Parliament, appealed to the Full Court on Wells' behalf. Despite these appeals and much debate about capital punishment in the Queensland press, Wells was executed on 22 March 1880 and buried in the Toowong Cemetery. However, the saga had its legacy, with Wells becoming the last man to be executed for armed robbery with wounding in Queensland. One of his supporters, Arthur Rutledge MLA, on becoming Attorney General (November 1883 to June 1888), legislated to have armed robbery removed from the list of capital offences in Queensland. The tree in which Wells hid has become integrally associated with the robber's story and its outcome, and is a feature of interest to tourists.  Description  The Robber's Tree is situated on the outskirts of Cunnamulla at the southern end of Stockyard Street, near the corner of Bedford Street, on a low sand ridge. A low fence of metal posts and wire has been constructed around it. The tree is a mature specimen, said to be a Cypress Pine (Callitris cupressiformis), measuring high in 1979. The Cypress Pine is an Australian native, resistant to dry, sandy conditions, and is found in all Australian states.  Heritage listing  The Robbers Tree was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Local legend connects this tree with the story of a robbery in Cunnamulla in 1880, which had repercussions for the practice of capital punishment in Queensland. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Robber's Tree is significant for its strong social value to the community as the focus of a local bushranger legend in southwest Queensland and it has become a feature of interest to tourists.
