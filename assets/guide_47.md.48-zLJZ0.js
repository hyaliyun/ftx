He is the Motorsports Manager and development driver at Red Rooster Performance. He is also the Driving Instructor at Red Rooster Performance Motorsports Academy.  Motorsport career  Karna was given his first taste of motorsport in a Motocross bike at the age of six. He began participating in local Motocross events at the age of nine. His parents Prakash Kadur (former Indian rally champion) and Nirmala Prakash were instrumental in showing support in his career. Later Karna moved on to Go- Karting Championship events and eventually made his way to the National racing championship where he drove the Formula Rolon series till 2006. In 2009, Karna took a short break after suffering a shock loss in his family and returned with rallying as a privateer in his first outing. In the same year, Karna was selected through Red Rooster Racing's Talent Identification Program by N.Leelakrishnan and went on to win the Rally Star cup championship. In 2010, Karna was promoted as the team's fourth driver in a Mitsubishi Group N Cedia. However, Red Rooster Racing pulled out of motorsports citing lack of sponsorship at the end of the season. In 2011, Karna participated as a privateer supported by Red Rooster Performance and went on to win his first national title in the Group N Indian National Rally championship. In 2012, Karna finished 1st runner up in the overall Indian National Rally Championship driving a Mitsubishi Group N Cedia prepared by N.Leelakrishnan of Red Rooster Performance. In 2014, Karna was the stand-in driver for Team Mahindra Adventure. In 2015, Karna was brought in as the second driver at Team Yokohama India. He partnered with an International Co-Driver Vivek Ponnusamy from Australia. He went on to drive a Group N Volkswagen Polo prepared by N.Leelakrishnan of Red Rooster Performance. The pair won the 1600 Group N championship. Team Yokohama India had fielded a car each in the INRC 2000 & INRC 1600 categories. A Volkswagen Polo driven by Karna and co-driven by Nikhil V. Pai in the INRC 1600 and a Mitsubishi Cedia driven by Rahul Kantharaj and Vivek Bhat in the INRC 2000. Both the cars were prepared by N.Leelakrishnan of Red Rooster Performance. Their victory helped Team Yokohama India to secure the Team Championship in the group N 1600 and 2000 respectively for the first time since its inception. In 2016, was the turnaround year in Karna's career. Still driving for Team Yokohama, he partnered with the country's most experienced co-driver, Nikhil V. Pai. Karna's co-Driver Nikhil V. Pai happens to have over 35 years of motorsport experience as well as having co-driven for the top drivers in the country since the early 1980s. Team Yokohama India had fielded two cars in the INRC 2000, a Volkswagen Polo driven by Karna and co-driven by Nikhil and a Mitsubishi Cedia driven by Rahul Kantharaj and Vivek Bhat. Both the cars were prepared by N.Leelakrishnan of Red Rooster Performance While the team's primary goal was to secure yet another subcategory national title, the surprise was indeed in store. At the first rally in Coimbatore Karna suffered an electrical issue during the rally and had to be content with finishing 3rd in the INRC 2000 and Overall 4th. Tragically after the scrutiny of the rally, the rally car on its way back to the base, caught fire and was gutted. With the next round in 3 weeks at Nasik and no time to source, a new car The Team at Red Rooster Performance managed to put the same car back together under the parts support from Volkswagen Motorsports India. Karna did not disappoint his team's efforts and secured a well fought second place in Nasik having just lost by 1 second and in the third round in Rally De North even managed to defeat the mightier Mahindra's XUV's to finish an overall second to the Volkswagen Polo R2 spec of Arjun Rao. Next up at the season's 4th round at Coffee Day India Rally - an Asia Pacific Rally Championship as well, Karna and co-driver Nikhil dominated the event and went on to win the Overall National Championship by finishing an overall first with still a round to spare at Bangalore the following month. This is Volkswagen Polo's first overall rally victory in the country after 4 years of its inception in this field. Also, this being a group n spec car it proved to be mightier than the more powerful cars in the field for the 2016 season. As of 2017, Karna is back, participating in the MRF FMSCI Indian National Rally Championship, along with co-driver Nikhil Pai, as the defending title champion driver and placed second overall and first in the INRC 2 Class at the Rally of Coimbatore.

Section 8(1) confirms that \\"Nothing in this Part affects any law or custom relating to the marriage of members of the Royal Family.\\" Choice of law in tort Part III regulates choice of law for tort and delict. Section 9(2) states \\"The characterisation for the purposes of private international law of issues arising in a claim as issues relating to tort or delict is a matter for the courts of the forum\\", which replicates the common law position in relation to that issue. Section 10 abrogates the common law rule on double actionability from the case of Phillips v Eyre (1870) LR 6 QB 1. Section 11 lays down the new rule, that the choice of law for tort and delict shall be the lex loci delicti commissi (\\"place where the wrong occurred\\"). Subsection (2) clarifies that where the tort occurs across different countries: * in relation to personal injury or death resulting from personal injury, it is the law of the country where the individual was when he sustained the injury; * in relation to damage to property, it is the law of the country where the property was when it was damaged; and * in any other case, it is the law of the country in which the most significant element or elements of those events occurred. Section 12 creates a \\"flexible exception\\" where the tort is overwhelmingly more connected with another country to that indicated by section 11. Section 13 creates a general exception for libel and slander. Defamation continues to be regulated by the common law rules and still requires double actionability.

Three complementary lines of scholarship have sought to generate knowledge about child development in Africa, specifically rooted in endogenous, African ways of knowing: analysis of traditional proverbs, theory-building, and documentation of parental ethno-theories. The first approach has examined the indigenous formulations of child development and socialisation values embedded in African languages and oral traditions. Several collections of proverbs have been published in different African languages,Milimo, J. T. 1972. Bantu Wisdom. Lusaka, NECZAM. and their content has been analysed to show the recurrence of the themes of shared communal responsibility for children's moral guidance and the importance of providing it early in life.Abubakar, A. 2011.

African Religions and Philosophy. Oxford, Heinemann.Moumouni, A. 1968. Education in Africa. New York, Praeger. The theory explains a worldview shared among various ethnic groups, and is grounded in systematic observational research and personal experience of the socialisation practices of the rural Nso people of Cameroon.Nsamenang, A. B. and Lamb, M. E. 1995. e force of beliefs: How the parental values of the Nso of Northwest Cameroon shape children‚Äôs progress towards adult models. Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, 16, pp. 613-627. The growth of social selfhood takes place in seven phases, each characterized by a developmental task. In the first phase, the naming ceremony projects the kind of socialized being the neonate should become. The major task of this phase is success in social priming: babies are cuddled and teased to smile along with adults; parents and other caregivers offer food items and playthings, and lure them verbally and nonverbally to return the ‚Äògifts‚Äô ‚Äì a prelude towards induction into the ‚Äòsharing and exchange norms‚Äô that bond the social system. RabainRabain, J. 1979. L‚ÄôEnfant du lignage. Paris, Payot. and MtongaMtonga, M. 2012. Children‚Äôs Games and Plays in Zambia. Lusaka, UNZA Press. describe similar infant teasing practices among the Wolof of Senegal and among the Chewa and Tumbuka of Zambia. Such interactions are believed to cultivate generosity. The second phase, ‚Äòsocial apprenticing‚Äô, roughly corresponds with childhood. Its principal task is to recognize and rehearse social roles that pertain to four hierarchical spheres of life: self, household, network, and public. Adults assign responsibility to preadolescent and adolescent children including the care and socialization of younger children which serves the function of priming the emergence of social responsibility. The priming strategies embedded in indigenous African childcare practices have important implications for the design of culturally appropriate forms of intervention to optimize developmental opportunities for children. In many African communities, far from a form of exploitation, caregiving responsibilities assigned to preadolescents and adolescents are part of ‚Äòan indigenous educational strategy that keeps children in contact with existential realities and the activities of daily life [that] represents the participatory component of social integration‚Äô. A case study in Zambia found that this strategy was successfully integrated into a service-learning programme at a primary school that promoted social responsibility among both girls and boys and generated improved academic performance.Serpell, R. 2008. Participatory appropriation and the cultivation of nurturance: a case study of African primary health science curriculum development. In Dasenm P. R., and Akkari, A. (eds). Educational Theories and Practices from the Majority World. New Delhi, India, Sage. The generalisability of Nsamenang's ‚ÄòWest African‚Äô theory across the many different societies in sub-Saharan Africa is debatable. For instance, there are mother-infant interactions among the Gusii of rural Kenya in the 1950s and 1970s that stands in marked contrast to Nsamenang's description of social priming through cuddling and teasing.LeVine, R. A., Levine, S., Dixon, S., Richman, A., Leiderman, P. H., Keefer, C. H. and Brazelton, T. B. 1994. Childcare and Culture: Lessons from Africa. Cambridge University Press. Gusii mothers, ‚Äòare not expected to talk to or gaze at their infants or play with them‚Äô, and they explain how this (strange to Western eyes) emotional detachment is compatible with healthy emotional development in later life. Part of their explanation is that the infants receive playful stimulation and emotional support from their elder siblings and other child caregivers. The contrast between these ethnographic accounts serves as a warning that wide variations occur across different ethnocultural groups within the African region,DeLoache, J. and Gottlieb, A. 2000. A World of Babies: Imagined Childcare Guides for Seven Societies. Cambridge. MA, USA, Cambridge University Press. and that further detailed research on socialization practices is needed.Marfo, K., Pence, A. R., LeVine, R. A. and LeVine, S. 2011. Introduction to the special section: Strengthening Africa‚Äôs contributions to child development research. Child Development Perspectives, 5 (2), pp. 104-111.  African games and songs  Another significant feature of the developmental niche described by many researchers on African early childhood is the prominence of elaborate play activities, unsupervised by adults. Marfo and BierstekerMarfo, K. and Biersteker, L. 2011. Exploring culture, play and early childhood education practice in African contexts. In Rogers, S. (ed.) Rethinking Play and Pedagogy in Early Childhood Education. New York, Routledge. note that while major Western psychological theories attribute to play an important role in child development, this is mainly focused on cognition, whereas anthropological studies in AfricaFortes, M. 1970. Time and Social Structure, and Other Essays. London, Athlone Press, New York,Humanities Press.Schwartzman, H. B. 1978. Transformation: the Anthropology of Children‚Äôs Play. New York, Plenum.Lancy, D. 1996. Playing on the Mother Ground: Cultural Routines for Children‚Äôs Development. New York, Guilford Press. have emphasised that play also serves as an interactive process of social enculturation, structuring opportunities for the rehearsal, critique and appropriation of cultural practices. The cognitive and social structure of African games has been extensively documented. Music and dance are notably rich dimensions of most African cultures and children participate in both from an early age. Mtonga analysed the texts of Chewa and Tumbuka children's songs and games observed in rural and urban areas of Zambia, highlighting how they reveal ‚Äòreasoning and understanding the psychology of other participants‚Äô, and ‚Äòplayful and skilful manipulation of certain word-sounds in order to distort meaning, create new concepts, or paint a satirical caricature...‚Äô. He also notes that children's play in these communities is generally inclusive of multiple age groups and of children with physical handicaps. Yet indigenous games are seldom deployed as resources for enrichment in early childhood care and education (ECCE) programmes in Africa, despite the heavy emphasis on play in the curricula imported from Western preschool orthodoxy. Okwany, Ngutuku and MuhangiOkwany, A., Ngutuku, E. and Muhangi, A. 2011. The Role of Knowledge and Culture in Childcare in Africa: a Sociological Study of Several Ethnic Groups in Kenya and Uganda. Lewiston, New York, USA, Edwin Mellen Press. describe a number of recent initiatives in Kenya and Uganda where a systematic attempt was made to ‚Äòleverage indigenous knowledge for child care‚Äô, by deploying local traditional songs, proverbs, and food production, preparation and preservation practices as resources for the enrichment of children's intellectual, emotional and nutritional development, rather than ‚Äòdowngrading‚Äô them in favour of those imported from the West. Unfortunately, as Hyde and KabiruHyde, K. A. L. and Kabiru, M. N. 2006. Early Childhood Development as an Important Strategy to Improve Learning Outcomes. ADEA (Association for the Development of Education in Africa), Working Group on Early Childhood Development). http://www.adeanet.org note, such efforts are relatively rare, and ‚Äòcentre-based programmes in Africa tend to be heavily influenced by Western culture and sometimes are not relevant to the needs of children and society‚Äô.  Child-to-Child approach (CtC)  Despite robust efforts by African governments over recent decades to broaden access to schooling, the structure of formal educational provision in most countries requires most of those who start out in Grade 1 to ‚Äòdrop out‚Äô long before completion of the full 12-year curriculum. Thus the process of formal education is perceived by teachers, parents and pupils alike as one in which students are challenged to climb up a narrowing staircase.Serpell, R. 1999b. Local accountability to rural communities: a challenge for educational planning in Africa. In F. Leach and A. Little (eds). Education, Cultures and Economics: Dilemmas for Development. New York, Garland. Dropping out at earlier stages is perceived as failure, and the individual's return to the community a source of disappointment. The experience of a few years of schooling is not generally perceived as adding value to the individual's productive capacity within the community. Thus, the purpose of schooling is widely understood as extractive recruitment of the best and brightest individuals out of the community into a higher, powerful, elite social stratum. A number of different ways of focusing education have been proposed in search of alternatives to the narrowing staircase model, including apprenticeship, lifelong learning, school production units, health education, and the Child-to-Child approach (CtC). CtC is designed to mobilise children as agents of health education.Pridmore, P. and Stephens, D. 2000. Children as Partners for Health: A Critical Review of the Child-to-Child approach. London, UK, ZED Press. It differs from the narrowing staircase model by focusing on the promotion of social responsibility in pre-adolescent children, an educational goal that resonates with the Chewa concept of nzelu. The widespread African practice of entrusting preadolescent children with the care of younger siblings was a major inspiration for the original proponents of CtC, which has been applied in more than 80 countries worldwide.CtC Trust (n.d.) http://www.child-to-child.org A case study was conducted of integrative curriculum development by a group of Zambian primary school teachers using the CtC approach. The insight that pre- adolescent children can take on responsibility as agents of infant care and nurture, within the context of primary health care and progressive social change, was re-appropriated by the African teachers at this school as a way of incorporating traditional cultural practices into the formal educational process. Striking long-term benefits were claimed by the graduates of the school's CtC curriculum, including a growth of egalitarian relations between the genders, even within adult marriages.Serpell, R., Mumba, P. and Chansa- Kabali, T. 2011.

Modern industry started there with Tianjin Machine Factory which was established by the Qing government during the Self-Strengthening Movement. Afterwards,Yuan Shikai promoted new policies in Tianjin. Numerous modern industrial enterprises mushroomed in Hebei New District in the northern bank of the Hai River. Including Zhou Xuexi, many industrialists established large enterprise groups that were managed by merchant and supervised by the government. By the beginning of the 20th century, Chinese private enterprises were booming. Among them is the most representative Yongli Alkali Factory which won the gold award and certificate in Philadelphia, the U.S. in 1926 by the sodium carbonate it produced. The factory was praised as \\"the symbol of developing important chemical industry of the Republic China\\". The development of Tianjin's modern industrial and the establishment of the Concessions in Tianjin contributed to the rapid expansion of modern Tianjin to become the biggest city and center of industry and commerce in northern China, as well as the second biggest city of industry, finance and trade in China. The development of Tianjin modern industry mainly went through four stages: initial period, evolution period, booming period and occupied period. Because of the industrial boom of Tianjin modern industry, the government of Tianjin built The Tianjin Museum of Modern Industry in Divergence estuary for commemoration.  Initial Period  One of the core leading figures in Tianjin Self-Strengthening Movement: Li Hongzhang The initial period of Tianjin modern industry refers to the Self-Strengthening Movement after its port opening. Under the influence of Self-Strengthening Movement, from 1866, the Qing government gradually established a wide range of military industries in Tianjin and its surrounding areas. In order to deal with foreign trade, the QIing government also set a position of Sankou Trading Minster (changed into North Trading Minster in 1870, post held by Viceroy of Zhili ). Tianjin then became the core area of Li Hongzhang's northern base, and this period is the initial period of Tianjin modern industry development. = The military industries established by Westernization Group = Full view of Haiguang temple and the western department of Tianjin Machine Factory After the Second Opium War, the Self-Strengthening Movement in Qing Dynasty began to flourish, and the \\"Westernization Group\\" started to establish government-sponsored industries leading by military industry. In 1867, a North Trading Minster called Chong Hou gained a land of 22 hectares near to Jiajia Gu Dao where is located in the area that is 18 kilometers from the old town of Tianjin. He entrenched and constructed a 4950-meter-long wall to build the eastern department of Tianjin Machine Factory. This gunpowder plant of the factory, often been called \\"Dong Ju Zi\\", was the earliest and biggest military industry of China at that time. This department provided northern provinces with guns and cartridges for military use, and also offered military materials for the Northern Fleet after the establishment of Beiyang Fleet. After Chong Hou, Viceroy of Zhili and North Trading Minster Li Hongzhang took over Tianjin Machine Factory, made it develop rapidly and become a large-scale military industrial factory covering machine manufacturing, metal refining, casting, hot working, basic chemistry, ship repair, etc. The eastern department of Tianjin Machine Factory gained the reputation of \\"One of the biggest machine factories in the world\\" at that time. In order to enhance coastal defense, the Qing government assigned Li Hongzhang to establish Beiyang FleetDagu shipyard in Tianjin i 1880. Dagu shipyard is the first shipyard in the North of modern China, and is called \\"the three major bases of Beiyang Fleet\\" withL√ºshun Military Harbor and Weihai Liugong Island. It was for repairing the warships of Beiyang Fleets, and started producing munitions from 1890. = The establishment of \\"government-supervised and merchant- managed\\" enterprises = One of representatives of Self-Strengthening Movement: Tong King-sing In order to cooperate with the development of military industry, in Tianjin, the Qing government built the earliest telegraph circuit, China's first autonomous standard railway, Kaiping Railway Company and Chinese Engineering and Ming Company. Chinese Engineering and Ming Company is the earliest large-scale mechanized coal-mining factory which offered military industries energies and materials. In 1878,Li Hongzhang was assigned to purchase Chinese Engineering and Ming Company that was established by Tong King-sing. At first, it was assumed to be government-managed, but later on because of the lack of fund, the Qing government converted it into government-supervised and merchant-managed. In the year of 1879, the telegraph circuit starting from Zhili Supervising Bureau, crossing the eastern department of Tianjin Machine Factory, Zizhulin concession, Chinese Merchants Steamship Company, to Taku Forts and Beitang military camp, is the earliest telegraph circuit in China. After that, the Tianjin-Shanghai telegraph circuit was constructed. Then the government established Tianjin Telegraph Headquarters in Tianjin, accompanied by the east subsidiary, the north subsidiary and the south subsidiary three subsidiaries. Although Tianjin Telegraph Group was \\"government-supervised and merchant-managed\\", all the \\"top official telegraphs\\" about foreign and military affairs would be sent in an order of \\"government first\\". The former site of Kailuan Mining Headquarters Established in 1880, the Tangshan-Xuegezhuang railway was suggested by Li Hongzhang to extend to Dagu and Tianjin for transporting Kaiping coals and munitions by Beiyang military forces. In 1887, Li Hongzhang changed the name of Kaiping Railway Company into Tianjin Railway Company(also Jingu Railway Company). After the construction of Jintang railway was completed, concerning about the defense of Beiyang, Li Hongzhang initiated the construction of railway from Tianjin to Shanhai Pass which was centered in Tianjin. Besides, in order to boost the trade contacts between the North and the South, Li Hongzhang established China Merchants Steamship Navigation Company as early as 1872. Its headquarter was in Shanghai, and Tianjin branch company was located in South Zizhuulin in Tianjin. = Early Foreign-funded enterprises = The earliest foreign-run modern enterprise was Dagu Barge Company, a British company in 1874. This company, however, was later than the China Merchants Steamship Navigation Company that established by Li Hongzhang. Foreign capital was permitted to input in Tianjin for barge transport, and the time limit was settled by the Qing government. In May 1874, the British-invested Dagu Barge Company was established, with total capital of 33,000 dollars. In September 1889, Dagu Barge Company reshuffled into a limited liability company, and the total capital was 500,000 Liang. By 1900, there were totally 19 foreign-funded enterprises in Tianjin, among which 16 were run by Britain and Germany. These enterprises were mostly foreign trade companies, among then there were 11 packaging companies. Besides, other early foreign-capitalized companies were mostly small-scale civil industries. = The establishment of private capital enterprises = Compared to foreign capital enterprises, private capital enterprises in Tianjin was lagged behind. Yilaimu Machine Mill, established by Zhu Qi'ang in 1878, symbolized the beginning of private capital enterprises in Tianjin.before 1900, the annual income of Yilaimu Machine Mill was 6,000 to 7,000 liang. Thereafter, private capital was continuously invested in and few mills were established, which could still sustain an income of 6,000 to 7,000 liang per mill per year. This proved that Yilaimu was in a rapidly expanding market. Although there is lack of historical record, it has been proved that among these newly established machine mills during 1990's were three that had been recorded: Dalaisheng Machine Mill, Tianlihe Machine Mill and South Gate Ruichenghe Machine Mill. Daide Machine Factory, established by a Cantonese merchant Luo Sanyou in 1884, was the first private capital ironworks in Tianjin. In the aspects of machine manufacturing, Tianjin also had Wanshun Ironworks which was established in the British concession in Tientsin in 1886. Besides, Taide and Wanshun were all located in Taku Road area (also Dagu Road today) that is near the concessions in Tianjin. In the beginning of the 20th century, there is also an ironworks named Zhichang. Therefore, this had been keeping its pace with the development of concessions in Tianjin, and the Taku Road was the birthplace of Tianjin early private capital machine manufacturing. In addition to above, early private capital machine processing industries include Jinjucheng Ironworks which was built in 1897 in Santiaoshi Road. Other industries, such as Tianjin Water Supply Company in 1886, Beiyang Cashmere Factory in 1897, and Beiyang Tannery in 1898, were all sponsored by a famous comprador Wu Kuiding. These companies were the earliest in the peer companies in Tianjin and even in the Northern part of China. There were over 30 enterprises in the initial stage of Tianjin modern industry among them were 19 foreign enterprises. In other 17 private industries, 6 of them were government-supervised or government-supervised and merchant-managed. These 6 enterprises were mostly related to military services, although they were government-supervised and merchant-managed in nature, they were controlled by the government. Private enterprises had later investment, smaller scale and fewer types. In Tianjin, early modern industries were specialized in military industry, and were large-scale, and they ranked top in China in many fields and were equipped with pioneering value. For instance, the first modern powder mill in China-- the eastern department of Tianjin Machine Factory; China's first industrial technology school--Beiyang Telegraph School;First autonomous standard railway and first telegraph circuit--‚ÄúBeitang‚ÄîTaku‚ÄîTianjin‚Äùmilitary telegraph circuit;the first shipyard in North China, etc. All these are closely related to Tianjin.  Evolution period  The advocate of Hebei New District: Yuan Shikai A map of Tianjin showing the construction of Hebei New District (North) The evolution period of Tianjin modern industry began with the \\"New Policy\\" promoted within Tianjin by Yuan Shikai, until the establishment of Republic of China. In around 1902, the Viceroy of Zhili and Beiyang Commerce Minister Yuan Shikai, promoted his \\"New Policy\\" in Tianjin. The initial period of the establishment of Republic of China represents the evolution period of Tianjin modern industry, which concentrated on the constructing Hebei New District, thriving education on modern industry, and developing private capital enterprises. = The development of \\"government- supervised and merchant-managed\\" industries = The \\"New Policy\\" which was promoted by Yuan Shikai in the 20th century had brought about new opportunities for Tianjin modern industry. In 1902, Zhou Xuexi was assigned by Yuan Shikai to establish Beiyang Silver Dollar Company. By this success, in 1906, Zhou established some important government-supervised and merchant- managed companies like Beiyang Quanye Iron Factory, which made Hebei New District a significant industrial zone. Meanwhile, Hebei New District also established Zhili College of Industry, Craftmanship Factory, Apprentice Factory and other educational institutions, which made it an important educational base. Zhou Xuexi took over Qixin Cement Company in Tangshan which had been closed down due to poor-quality products. Before its bankrupt, the company was Tangshan Fine Cotton Soil Company that was established by Tang Tingshu in 1889 and capitalized by private capital by Li Hongzhang. After taking over this company, Zhou Xuexi introduced contemporary most advanced cement production equipment‚Äîdry-process rotary cement kiln from Smith Company in Denmark‚Äîto produce high-quality products, which was a remarkable pioneering in China's cement production industry. = The transformation of military industry = Russian warship on the shore of Dagu shipyard In 1900, after Eight-Nation Alliance invaded China, large-scale government-managed industries in Tianjin were severely disrupted. The eastern department of Tianjin Machine Factory was occupied by the Eight-Nation Alliance and was then used as French military camp, while the western department, Haiguang Temple Machine Factory, was completely destroyed. In 1907 it was occupied by Japanese army, and then functioned as Japanese military camp. Beiyang Fleet Dagu Shipyard had been suffering a two-year occupation by Russia during 1900 and 1902. In 1906, Dagu shipyard came into service as a branch of Beiyang Quanye Iron Factory, and its powder factory was using as a school of military policemen. Since then, Dagu shipyard had been becoming a government-sponsored and merchant-managed enterprise. = The development of merchant-managed industries = Tianjin Bazaar which was displaying industrial crafts of Tianjin The private capital in Tianjin was accumulated in the ear of \\"New Policy\\", the construction of Hebei New District, Tianjin Currency Production Company, Zhili Craft Headquarter, and Beiyang Quanye Iron Factory were completed successively. In addition, the machine industry in Tianjin had already had its own merits and advantages, Santiaoshi Road area gradually formed the center of machine manufacturing industry. At the same time, the scope of this industrial zone expended from Hebei New District towards the west end of the Old Town of Tianjin. From 1902 to 1911, there were 139 industrial companies that had emerged in this city, covering mining industry, cement production, machine manufacturing, textile industry, food industry, etc. Among them, textile industry ranked top with the amount of 41, chemical industry (including the manufacture of matchsticks, leather, cosmetics and oil) ranked second with the amount of 31, food industry (including tobacco) ranked third with the amount of 20. Owing to these, Tianjin's pillar industries began to form. Many outstanding companies had been emerging at that time. For example, there are Tianjin Soap Factory which was established in 1905 near the Big Red Bridge, and tobacco company which was established by Ji Jufen in 1908. The steady development paved the way for afterward industrial prosperity of private capital enterprises in the period of Xinhai Revolution.

Published projects are classified in curated albums, each dedicated to a specific topic or typology.  History  Divisare is one of the first architecture websites in the history of the web. Online since 1998 as Europaconcorsi, it was rebranded in August 2015, launching three new different platforms: Divisare, Europaconcorsi and Architettura Italiana. At first, Europaconcorsi was a service to inform architects about design competitions in Europe (in Italian, \\"concorsi\\" means competitions), on recently issued tenders as well as the results of competitions, with rankings of the winners and the participating projects. From the outset Europaconcorsi was conceived as a structure of related but distinct databases: informations on competitions, projects and designers were gathered in autonomous data structures. With almost 20 years of history behind it, and over 140,000 projects, Divisare is the largest online archive of contemporary architecture. Curated by the team based in Rome, Italy, Divisare is structured as a library of thematic albums (organized per elements, cities, houses, ideas, materiality, plans & details, private interiors, public interiors, topics and types) featuring the most relevant pieces of architecture ever designed. Complementary with the daily showcase on the online platform, registered subscribers received Journal, a weekly review curated by the editorial staff. Divisare means imagining, designing with the mind, literally \\"to devise\\". The term was used by Leon Battista Alberti to define the work of the architect: \\"Him I call an Architect, who, by sure and wonderful Art and Method, is able, both with Thought and Invention, to devise.\\" (Leon Battista Alberti ‚Äî De Re Aedificatoria, 1450 - original Italian: \\"Architettore chiamer√≤ io colui, il quale sapr√† con certa, e maravigliosa ragione, e regola, s√¨ con la mente, e con lo animo divisare\\").

As of December 15, Divisare, Divisare Books and all personal pages became inactive. As of July 1, 2019, Divisare has relaunched their website and online bookstore.  Europaconcorsi  In August 2015, Europaconcorsi was split into three different platforms: Divisare, Europaconcorsi and Architettura Italiana. Today, Europaconcorsi (europaconcorsi.com) is the world's leading platform in professional information for architects and engineers about design competitions in Europe.  Architettura Italiana  Online since August 2015, Architettura Italiana (architettura-italiana.com) was set off with 16 years of work and experience, almost 80,000 registered designers, and over 100,000 projects in its archives. Divisare Books In early 2017, Divisare launched Divisare Books, a high- quality, independent editorial project, a modular publication dedicated to architecture documents, a constantly growing archipelago of monographic issues each tackling a different topic: drawings collections, photographic surveys, visual essays, short writings and projects. The first series of Divisare Books was released in March 2017. It included 45 titles and 3 limited edition box sets (Dario Passi - Drawings, Italian Interiors and Rory Gardiner - Museums).

Biography From 1839 to 1843 he was employed in Egypt and then Syria. In 1843 he was appointed acting consul-general in Serbia. In 1858 he became vice- consul at Missolonghi in Greece. In 1859 he was transferred to L√ºbeck and in May 1862 appointed consul at Ragusa and at Bocca di Cattaro. His book Highlands and Islands of the Adriatic gives an interesting account of Signor Arnieri, the principal land owner of the island of Korƒçula. Paton's book Researches on the Danube and the Adriatic mentions the significance given by the people of Ragusa to the mathematician Marino Ghetaldi. Paton's literary work is of interest for his book on the life and work of Stendhal and published correspondence with Sir Austen Henry Layard. Henry James wrote an unfavourable, unsigned review in The Nation for Paton's book on Stendhal. On 27 April 1852 Paton married Eliza Calvert at Saint Anne Soho, Westminster, London; they had a daughter Eliza Rebecca Anne Paton.

Minorca is a rocky island in the Balearic archipelago in Spain, consisting of eight municipalities. Featuring a Mediterranean climate, the weather is milder in the south while in the north there are strong winds all year round. Marine salt, carried by the wind to the pastures where cows graze, is what gives the cheese its typical flavour. Fish is a certain source of food, but additionally, there are horses, pigs (used for cold cuts) and cows (the skin of which is used to produce leather, and the milk to produce cheese). Agriculture is small-scale and varied, consisting of typical Mediterranean products. Within this typical Mediterranean cuisine there are also the influences of various invading people, particularly the English, who brought plum cake, puddings, and punch. The rural and marine cuisine is mostly based on greens and vegetables from one's own garden, locally produced meat, and fish and seafood caught in the same day.AADD Menorca: una volta per l'illa Ed. Triangle Postals. p. 155 Cold cuts are used as seasoning. Olive oil, although not produced on the island, is also a fundamental ingredient in local dishes. Minorcan cuisine is at times a survival cuisine, which preserves the original flavour of its high-quality products to the maximum. It is simple, with few complications, and above all seasonal. It is based on fishing, particularly longline fishing, and on seafood, especially crustaceans, clams and squid. Fruits and vegetables are cultivated in as much variety as possible, and on a small scale, only for local consumption. Until the second half of the twentieth century, goats were in such abundance that they were only eaten when there was a famine, caused by spoiled crops or insufficient fishing. Today, they are a luxury. The legs of Minorcan kids are particularly appreciated. There were so many rabbits on the island that Roman emperor Augustus had to send ferrets to help with hunting them; for this reason, rabbit is a common element of the cuisine. In later times, there were periods when hunting them was forbidden. In the seventeenth century, The English unsuccessfully attempted to introduce deer and hares. Few are left nowadays, but rabbits and various fowl are still hunted or bred.  General aspects  The recipes and ways of Minorcan cuisine have been mostly transmitted through oral tradition, as opposed to Catalonia, for example, where recipe books can be found even from the Middle Ages. In Minorca, the first written mentions of its cuisine are only found in 1891, in some notes belonging to Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria, who references some typical cooking but without any recipes. There is nothing else until 1923, when De re cibaria, by Pedro Ballester, is published, a \\"major work\\" that collects a substantial part of popular wisdom and offers detailed anonymous recipes, which nevertheless require prior knowledge of local cuisine in order to be interpreted.Menorca: Gastronom√≠a y cocina, p. 12 Minorcan cuisine is based on local products, from land or sea. Classic Mediterranean crops had a strong influence, encouraging the use of olive oil, wine, legumes and foods pickled in salt. The substratum of Arab culture is also important, as well as additions from French and English cuisine, in particular, owing to their respective periods of domination in the eighteenth century. Being a small island meant that the region passed through periods of scarcity, for various reasons, yet very flavourful dishes were still created despite also being very modest. Simpler versions of dishes that once belonged only to a minority were created, that were now accessible to everyone, under any circumstances. This is known as 'survival cuisine', and it is not absolutely exclusive to the island. Even during times of abundance, it is believed that a dish containing superfluous ingredients is not necessarily better, but actually the opposite, and the simplicity of a cuisine that would normally be considered 'poor and rural' is more appreciated. Even today, when most products can be obtained all year round, Minorca has a seasonal cuisine, with seasonal ingredients and recipes, which follows the cycles of nature and marked holidays, according to its traditions.  Basic ingredients  * Fish: pearly razorfish, sheepsheads, stingrays (wings and liver), scorpionfish, groupers, goosefish, rock fish in general, and salted cod. * Seafood: mussels, cockles, squid, cuttlefish, octopus, shrimp, scampi, lobster, crab, sea snails. * Vegetables: vine tomatoes, onion, garlic, chili pepper, aubergine, courgette. * Legumes: dry white string beans (called guixons on the island). * Greens: chard, spinach, peas (called fesols on the island), cabbage. * Fruits: figs, peaches, apricots, pears, grapes, oranges, lemons. * Nuts: dates, almonds, pine nuts. * Meat: chicken, rabbit, pork, beef, cold cuts. * Mushrooms: saffron milk cap, Scotch bonnet, dry mushrooms. * Other: olive oil, bread, honey, capers, wine, eggs, snails, ricotta, figat (similar to Spanish fig cake and meringue).  Specialties  Basic ingredients of mayonnaise: eggs, olive oil and lemon juice = Mayonnaise = Mayonnaise supposedly originates in the city of Mah√≥n. According to this theory, this sauce - an emulsion of eggs and olive oil - became known as a consequence of the brief French occupation of the island, which would take it to France. According to a different theory, it was invented in a French town called Maiona, or perhaps Baiona. A third is based on the dislike of the French towards garlic. As they tasted the Minorcan aioli, the French asked for the garlic to be removed, which left them with a white sauce made of olive and eggs: mayonnaise.Pla, Josep, 1970, El que hem menjat, Barcelona, (1997 Premsa catalana) In any case, mayonnaise, with or without garlic, is a product of frequent use in the traditional cuisine of the island since ancient times, on its own or as an ingredient in dishes. = Mah√≥n cheese = Mah√≥n cheese A local cheese is produced in Minorca: Mah√≥n cheese. It features Denominaci√≥n de Origen Protegida (Protected Demonination of Origin). It is pressed instead of boiled, and has a characteristic orange colourm, a parallelepiped shape, and rounded corners. It is made and matured only in Minorca, according to tradition and to the norms of the DO. In 1985, the definitive form of the Denomination of Origin was given as queso Mah√≥n, and later, in 1998, the word Menorca was added, making the full name Mah√≥n- Menorca. There are four main varieties, according to maturation time: mild, semi-mature, mature and aged. Ricotta or fresh, high-quality cottage cheese is also made in the same dairy shops in Minorca, but it does not have a specific name and is not widely known, since it is consumed only locally.Fuster, Xim; G√≥mez, Manel. Menorca: gastronom√≠a y cocina. Sant Llu√≠s: Triangle Postals, 2005.  Cold cuts  Minorcan sobrassada With the exception of the sobrassada, the cold cuts made in Minorca are an evolution of the Roman legacy. Everything is made of pork. The slaughter of the pigs, usually undertaken in winter, is called porquejades or porquetjades. Blood is added as an ingredient to some of these products, which gives them a black colour. Similarly to the cuisine of the Catalan cuisine, the spices used are few and not very varied, but they are the ones that give each product a distinct personality, and makes them different and flavourul. The spices normally used are black pepper, white pepper, paprika (in sobrassada), anise, cinnamon and salt. Some also add other typical Mediterranean spices such as thyme, rosemary and oregano. Piles and butifarras of escudella ‚Ä¢ White Botifarra, of grayish clear brown color, since it does not contain blood, it has the form of the ball that is used for the escudella. It is made up of meat and other parts of the pig and it is surrounded by a fine membrane. It is generally eaten cooked, usually fried. ‚Ä¢ Black Botifarra, it has the same ingredients and species that the white one, but contains in addition pig blood. Its shape is like the one of a fine Botifarra. It is often eaten fried with Sobrassada and it is sometimes eaten raw. ‚Ä¢ Camot or cuixot in Ciudadela, it is a cooked, black, and very greasy sausage, basically the same as Majorcan Camaiot but with less pellets. It usually contains pig minced meat, blood, black pepper, a pinch of Paprika and another one of anise. Its appearance is very different from the others, since it is inserted within a pig leg, where the name comes from. It is eaten raw, cut in very fine slices, or cooked. ‚Ä¢ Carnixulla or meat-and-Xua, it is a cured raw sausage of chopped lean meat mixed with bacon cut in small squares and marinated with salt, pepper and sometimes other species. The elaboration process goes through a drying process inside the intestine while other transformations take place. Contrary from the sobrassada, fermentation does not take place. Its aspect reminds one of a whip. This cold cut is the only specific one of Minorca and perhaps the oldest one of the island. Minorcan Sobrassada , thinner and less spicy than the Majorcan. These cold cuts are elaborated in all the Balearic Islands.  Traditional dishes  = Vegetables, legumes and greens = Stuffed zucchini. Spinach Rubiol, traditional dish from the patronal feasts of the island Spinach Rubiol, traditional dish from the patronal feasts of the island Minorcan cuisine is very Mediterranean, rich in vegetables of all types. The island has been very self-sufficient providing these type of fresh products, thus they have never gone missing, thanks to the farming activity as part of the economy even to this day, time in which the crops represent approximately half of the Minorcan territory.Menorca: gastronomia i cuina, p. 23 The salad, hanging, bouquet tomatoes, etc. ,and other green vegetables to prepare salads and stir fry stand out‚Äîonions, Italian green peppers, red pepper, garlic‚Äî, Roman lettuce to prepare salads, Mediterranean green vegetables that are fried, stuffed or oven baked, like eggplant, that in Minorca is small and very white in its interior, a variety of the summer season that cannot be cultivated in a greenhouse, zucchini, that is prepared in a similar way, or the artichoke, that is also from a local variety, small, long, and purple- colored, that is eaten mainly as a side dish, battered and fried, oven-baked or in stews. Fruits are also abundant, especially figs, that are also eaten in savoury dishes, like for example the oliaigua. Local green vegetables are prepared a \\"thousand ways\\",Menorca: gastronomia i cuina, p. 24 some of the most common are the guixons', the habas, the lentils, and the chickpeas. Mushrooms are very much appreciated, oven-baked, fried, with or without sauce to accompany meats, and the wild asparagus, very appreciated in the oliaigua (local soup) or simply with a tortilla. Olive oil is the grease that is used to cook these dishes and is also common in pastry, while olives themselves are appreciated in this cooking, just like local capers.Menorca:gastronomia i cuina, p. 60 Until a few decades ago there were hundreds of olive trees in Minorca but nowadays these are not cultivated. Some Minorcan dishes that contain these ingredients are: * Oven baked eggplant: a species of local eggplant is used that is smaller and more tender, they are thinly laminated and oven-baked in a single layer, covered in shredded bread, with minced garlic and basil. It is similar to the carbassonada, made with zucchini instead of eggplant, and usually has chopped onion and is eaten in the other Balearic Islands. Oven-baked tomatoes and stuffed zucchini are also traditional. * Oliaigua, which in its origin was the scantiest soup, food for when you were lacking ingredients. It is usually eaten with figs during the summer.Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 66 * Perol, consists of a layer of laminated potatoes, another of laminated tomatoes, covered with shredded bread, garlic, basil and grilled. You can add fish- gilt-head bream or striped red mullet, for example, in between the layers of potatoes and tomatoes.Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 74 * Cuttlefish with fesols is a stew with fresh cuttlefish and peas, it is very common that is also traditionally served as a tapa. Sometimes little balls of minced meat are added.Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 102 A lot of salty products are made with wheat flour, many of which the bread dough often encircles the land's produce, like for example, the rubiols, the Minorcan flaons- salty pasta filled with cheese-, to the agujas or croissants ‚Äì made with bread dough and shaped like a half moon ‚Äì filled with sobrassada.Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 48 The formatjades stand out, common in Easter time. The salty cocas are usually rectangular, open or closed, and can be traditionally filled with a stir-fry, vegetables or pepper, even though some have meat or fish. On Christmas eve it is common to eat, before the Midnight Mass, bread rolls filled with diced meat and soaked in milk and oven-cooked.Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 110 Kaldera or as it's best known, lobster kaldereta. = Fish and seafood = Sea products, for their insular condition, are widely consumed. Traditionally, Whitefish is used just the same- like for example, Goosefish or the Hake- like the Oily fish- like the Atlantic mackerel or the sardine, for example-, very fresh, bought the same day it is fished. This type of cooking with fish is traditional because many Minorcans have a boat, in which they go fishing on weekends and in summer it was a customary, and it still happens, to go around the island on a boat, an excursion that forced you to eat the captured and cooked fish on board. The Scorpaena or scrofa, among them,Menorca: gastronomia i cuina, p. 63 is a highly appreciated and abundant fish. Another appreciated fish is the RajiformesMenorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 96 that can be oven-baked, grilled or in a paella. A number of seafood, shells and mollusks are also used. These products, just like the earth products, change according to the season. They are cooked in pots or boilers, rice, and sometimes also in salty pies or puddings, oven-baked, grilled or in the oven. In Minorca there is a great tradition of eating varied fish, and even octopus or squid, in the form of meatballs. The cod ab burrida,Menorca: Gastronom√≠a y cocina, p. 93 that is prepared mixing cod sauce with garlic and oil dressing, is a dish that has the resemblance with others cooked in Catalonia, Provence, and other nearby areas. Some Minorcan dishes with fish and seafood are: * Stuffed calamari, oven-baked or in a saucepan, it is an elaboration that has been established in the Minorcan cookbook and has an established reputation for its subtlety of aromas. * Lobster stew: until not long ago this type of sauce or bread soup was a poor fisher's dish, since Minorcan's lobsters were easy to find. Add bits of lobster on top of onions, tomato, garlic, and parsley and boil over high heat. Kaldereta is the best known internationally Minorcan dish, and of all the Minorcan pots the most emblematic is lobster.Menorca: gastronomia i cuina, p. 20 Other pots that are prepared a lot are made of fish, usually roca fish, like the grouper pot. * Baked common cockle, covered with shredded bread, garlic, and parsley. * Cabracho (scorpion fish) meatballs,Menorca: Gastronom√≠a y cocina, p. 90 with a saut√©ed and chopped sauce. Some put a little of grated Mah√≥n cheese shredded in the meatballs, mixed with the fish. You can do it with other fish, for example, the ones used in soups. Meatballs in meat sauce are also prepared, which in this case contain pine nuts, it can be eaten as a tapa in bars and not only as a main dish. =Meats= Pig farming is common locally, because pigs are easy to raise and traditional sausages are very popular. There is also cattle farming, which is the traditional source of milk -to make cheese among other things, meat and hides; the latter being used as a raw material for the local traditional leather craftsmen8. A very old recipe is, for example, the Feixets or Chaplain‚Äôs Partridges, thinly sliced veal rolls filled with boiled egg, bacon and sobrasada.Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 115 Lamb, chicken and rabbit are also consumed. There are local varieties of chicken and lamb. Game meats, which are currently very limited, are mainly rabbits and birds. Rabbits are hunted with the help of dogs, including an indigenous breed, the Rabbit‚Äôs Dog, and shotguns, while for the haunting of birds, typical techniques are the use of decoy and the fencing in the neck. Snails are also part of this gastronomy, both in simple preparations, with alioli, for example, and in many more sophisticated ones, such as snails with sea crab. Some Minorcan dishes with meats or sausages are: * Arroz de la Tierra, Rice of the Land; which is not made with rice but with wheat, crushed in a mortar, and baked with assorted sausages. It resembles the African couscous.Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 84 * Fried lamb or fried pork, sometimes called Frit Menorqu√≠ by the islanders. * \\"Macarrones\\" with gravy,Menorca: Gastronomia i cuina, p. 83 penne pasta and meat, cooked halfway between the typical Italian way - the pasta is cooked separately and then added to the rest of the ingredients - and the traditional Catalan way ‚Äì the pasta is cooked at the end with the rest of ingredients, like the noodles‚Äô casserole. It also has a British influence, where gravy is a kind of simple meat preparation serving as a bed for the pasta. Typical desserts and pastries Coca bamba. Crespells. Crespellets. Plate of orelletes. The Minorcan bakery, pastry, and dessert making incorporates ideas, techniques and products from cultures as diverse as Jewish, Arabic and English. The brief stay of the French in the island served to create the \\"Gat√≥\\", according to the technique of the French housewives of the moment, but incorporating almonds in the recipe. From the British the islanders took a taste for puddings, they use Catalan cream abundantly; and they also use meringue in the Italian way, to take advantage of the egg whites to decorate desserts and cakes. This taste for very sweet recipes is shared in common with other neighbours in the southern Mediterranean. * The \\"Amargos\\", or Bitters, are cookies made with egg whites and almonds, similar to Italian Amaretti with almonds, and to the French \\"Macarons\\". * The Bu√±uelos de Todos las Santos, Fritters of All Saints, are made with soft cheese from Mahon for All Saints' Day, when the \\"panellets\\" are also cooked. * The \\"Carquinyoli Menorquines\\", or \\"Carquinyols de Es Mercadal\\", which are square-shaped unlike the continental \\"Carquinyoli\\"s. They are like chocolate tablets, and have a homogeneous texture, although they are also dry and hard. They are made with almonds, egg white, sugar and flour. * The \\"Coca de Tomate de Ciudadela\\", flatbread with slices of tomato, garlic, parsley, sugar and chopped cookie. * The \\"Coca Bamba\\", or \\"Coca de San Juan\\" in Ciudadela, thick and tall in the middle flatbread in the form of snail that contains boiled potato and is eaten for breakfast, as an afternoon snack or with hot chocolate during the local festivities. \\"Pudin\\" is made with the \\"Cocas\\" that get hard after a few days of non-consumption. With the same recipe for \\"Coca Bamba\\" are also made individual round small Cocas, or \\"Coquitas\\", covered with apricots, cherries or other seasonal fruit. With the same dough are also made the \\"Bu√±uelos de Pasta Bamba\\" fritters. * The Crespells of Minorca are flower-shaped cookies with about twelve petals, covered with fine sugar and stuffed either with jam or with a paste made of cottage cheese and lemon. They have a round hole in the middle to see what they are stuffed with. In the other Balearic islands \\"Crespells\\" are very different. * The Crespellets or \\"Crespellines\\" are dry, round, large and thin cookies with a toothed edge. * The \\"Cuscuss√≥\\" has the appearance of a loaf of bread covered with candied fruit and pine nuts, like a \\"Coca de San Juan\\". The dough is made with Catalan style rustic bread, which is soaked in water with sugar; almonds are added, cinnamon, lemon peel, etc. And then it is kneaded again. * The \\"Ensaimada\\" is made both in Majorca and in Minorca. * The \\"Formatjades de Reques√≥n\\" are sweet \\"Formatjades\\" stuffed with a mixture containing cottage cheese and lemon peel. * \\"Alayor\\" cookies are a kind of round bun with a \\"closed hole\\" in the middle. The dough has a bit of anise in it. They are eaten mainly at breakfast and as an afternoon snack, dunked in milk. They can be opened in half and spread with jam or honey. They can be soft or hard inside, we can know depending on the appearance of the outer surface layer. * \\"Gat√≥\\" is a kind of cake where the flour is replaced with chopped almonds. * The \\"Macarrones de la Ciudadela\\" are small white cookies made with egg white, lots of sugar and sometimes also bits of almonds. They have a six-pointed flower shape. * \\"Orelletes\\", which are pronounced \\"oran\\" in Minorca,Menorca: gastronom√≠a y cocina, p. 146 are fried dough. They are thin, irregular and crisp, aromatised with muscat wine and served with warm honey. * Minorcan \\"Pastissets\\", in Minorca are five or six-petalled flower-shaped cookies, covered with fine sugar and made with lard, flour, egg, sugar, lemon zest. * \\"Pudin de Reques√≥n Menorqu√≠n\\", or Minorcan cottage cheese pudding; with Alayor cookies and traditionally garnished with raisins and pine nuts. * Pudding of Coca Bamba, sometimes made with Ensaimadas; like a custard dessert consistent enough to be cut into pieces. * Grapes and cheese, a simple dessert. * The \\"Rubiol\\" is a sweet empanada similar to the sweet \\"Pastisset\\" of Valencia, typical of Majorca and Minorca. * \\"Rissats\\", rectangular biscuits decorated with curled waves drawn on the surface with a fork. They are similar to the \\"Crespellines\\". * \\"Tatis\\" are like the Catalan \\"Carquinyolis\\" but with chocolate. * \\"Turr√≥n Quemado, from Mercadal. A peculiar kind of nougat. * \\"Tortada\\", a cake made of chopped almonds, is frequent in the Spanish gastronomy, which in Minorca has the particularity of being usually covered completely with burnt egg yolk and meringue, and sometimes also sugar. This decoration is very typical of the island, and is usually found in the \\"Monas de Pascua\\" - Easter cakes, birthday cakes, and \\"Brazos de Gitano\\" ‚Äì Swiss rolls - which, if not filled with Catalan cream, are usually also stuffed inside with egg yolk.  Typical drinks  * \\"Calent\\", an artisan drink that is infused with herbs, cinnamon, anise and saffron, and it can be drunk hot or ice-cold. * \\"Estomagale\\" is a soft herbs liquor, with a very particular flavor and texture. * \\"Frigola\\" is thyme in Minorca.

Senthil Nadan. Featuring Rahman, Suresh and Aditi Gururaj in the lead roles, the film's score and soundtrack is composed by Prem Kumar. The film began production during July 2015 and was released on 17 March 2017. The film was dubbed and released in Telugu as Dr. Sathyamurthy in 2018. Cast * Rahman as Sathyamoorthy Rathnavel (Rohit) * Suresh as Arjun * Aditi Gururaj as Kanmani * Devika Madhavan * Delhi Ganesh * Meera Krishnan * Swaminathan * Chaams * Pandu * Sai Prashanth as Kishore * Rekha Suresh Production The film began production in July 2015 and marked the return of director R. Senthil Nadan, who had previously made the horror film Sivi (2007). Senthilnadan had launched the film titled FB with tagline Statushae Podu Chat Pannu, but later changed the title to Oru Mugathirai. Described as a psychological thriller based on Facebook, Rahman was signed to portray the lead role of a psychiatrist, while newcomer Suresh and Aditi Gururaj were also cast in the film. Aditi had initially refused the film, though Senthil Nadan managed to convince her to agree terms after six months. The film was shot in 42 days in and around Goa, Puducherry and Ooty, with music composed by Prem Kumar, an associate of A. R. Rahman, while Saravanapandian, handled the camera work. Senthil Nadan worked on the project simultaneously alongside his commitments for a horror film titled Raja Magal. The success of Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru (2016) starring Rahman prompted producers of his delayed ventures to publicise and release their films to make most of the actor's renaissance at the box office. Subsequently, after the release of Pagadi Aattam in February 2017, Oru Mugathirai was prepared for a March 2017 release. Furthermore, the success of Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru's Telugu version, D16, meant that distributor D. Venkatesh also purchased Telugu dubbing rights for the film in March 2017. Similar to his lack of promotional activity for Pagadi Aattam, Rahman opted not to promote the film. For the film's release in Malaysia, it was agreed that profits from the film would go towards financing Tamil schools in the country. Soundtrack The film's music was composed by Premkumar Sivaperuman, while the audio rights of the film was acquired by Times Music India. The album released on 19 August 2016 and featured five songs. Release The film opened on 17 March 2017 to negative reviews, with the critic from The Times of India giving the film a negative review and stating \\"the theatrical nature of the performances, and the clumsy filmmaking drains the tension from the scenes\\". The critic further added \\"you can only sympathise with Rahman, whose career seemed to have taken an upturn with Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru (2016). For now, that film's success has resulted in two of his sub-standard previous outings (Oru Mugathirai and Pagadi Aattam) getting a release and taking things back to square one\\".

Event  The event's acronym, W.A.V.E., is a nod to Flag Day, which is observed on June 14 in the United States. 400 demonstrators, wearing suffragette yellow and white, marched in front the entrance to MoMA's newly expanded 53rd street building; a well received renovation that doubled its gallery space and increased traffic to the museum. Demonstrators had three demands: that MoMA exhibit works by women artists from their permanent collection, that it display women's work in loaned exhibitions, and that it create a policy to acquire women's work in the future. The WCA created pins to parody MoMA's \\"Museum of Modern Art OPENS\\" staff badges, upon which they included the addition \\"But Not to Women Artists.\\" Cards were distributed listing the names of 100 well known female artists who were not featured in the exhibit, including Alice Neel, Louise Nevelson, Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, Faith Ringgold and Louise Bourgeois. One spokesperson for the museum, Louisa Kreisberg, noted that a film series in the exhibition featured four women of the six films shown, and that the staff at the museum was roughly 65% female.  Organizers  The event was organized by the New York chapter of the Women's Caucus for Art (WCA), and supported by three additional feminist arts organizations; The Heresies Collective, Women's Interart Center, and New York Feminist Art Institute.

A faction within the church, including the bishop of Jihan, claimed the ordination went against church canons and slandered Athanasius to Joscelin II, Count of Edessa. Members of the faction suggested that Joscelin should hold another synod to elect a new patriarch according to the canons of the Syriac Orthodox Church. The count summoned Timothy, Bishop of Gargar, a city within his domain, to Samosata for his counsel, to which Timothy lent his support to Athanasius. However, Joscelin forbade the proclamation of Athanasius as patriarch throughout the County of Edessa as he had not paid homage to the count.Moosa (2008)MacEvitt (2010), p. 109 Athanasius subsequently travelled from the city of Melitene to the neighbouring Monastery of Mor Barsoum. Joscelin II continued to interfere in church affairs as he proclaimed Basilius Bar Shumanna, Bishop of Kesum, as bishop of Edessa. The patriarch confirmed Bar Shumanna as Bishop of Edessa and in his place ordained Iliyya as bishop of Kesum, who assumed the name John. In return, John received the ritual objects needed to consecrate a new patriarch that Joscelin had seized from the Monastery of Mor Barsoum in 1129. Athanasius met and reconciled with Joscelin II, and bishops who opposed him, at Turbessel, the capital of the County of Edessa in early 1144, following Joscelin's return from the coronation of Baldwin III in Jerusalem in December 1143. Basilius Bar Shumanna and Athanasius later met at Amid and was ordained as bishop of Sebaberk, a diocese within the archdiocese of Edessa, as he had been deprived of his see following the fall of Edessa in December 1144. During Athanasius' tenure as patriarch, the Monastery of Mor Barsoum was ransacked on 18 June 1148 by Joscelin II, who, seriously lacking in funds, stole the Hand of Mor Barsoum, the monastery's most prized possession, and took fifty monks as prisoners. The monks were later allowed to return to the monastery after their 10,000 dinar ransom had been paid in August 1148, and the relic was returned at the additional cost of 5000 dinars in December 1150. On 9 December 1157, Athanasius, alongside Baldwin III, King of Jerusalem, Aimery of Limoges, Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Thoros II, Lord of Cilicia, Michael Rabo, abbot of the Monastery of Mor Barsoum and future successor to Athanasius, and others, attended the consecration of a new church in Antioch. The patriarch continued to administer the Syriac Orthodox Church prior to his death in 1166.

However, upon the sale of Bluebridge's mobile app business in November 2016, the company shifted their focus to employee engagement and adopted the Emplify name as its own.  Corporate history  Bluebridge Digital., Inc. logo, predecessor to Emplify, Inc. Bluebridge Digital., Inc., known as Bluebridge, was founded in 2011 by Santiago Jaramillo out of his college dorm room. The company began as a mobile app platform for churches and tourism organizations built on a proprietary common code base. In February 2016, Bluebridge acquired Cadence Consulting, which became the initial network of early adopters for the employee engagement sector of the business. As part of the acquisition, Bluebridge also hired Todd Richardson, Cadence Consulting founder and former ExactTarget executive, as their Chief People Officer. Around this same time, Bluebridge introduced Emplify, which was originally developed for internal company use, as a new product line after employee engagement accounted for more than half of new sales for the company. The launch was boosted with a $3 million round of funding by Midwestern venture capital firms Allos Ventures and Cultivation Capita. ‚ÄúThe response was so terrific that we decided to create a new brand focused entirely on employee engagement,‚Äù said Jaramillo. Then, in November 2016, Bluebridge hit a pivot point in company direction. It was announced that Bluebridge was selling its church and tourism business units for a combined $8 million to two separate buyers. Bluebridge sold its Bluebridge Churches unit to echurch powered by PushPay, a mobile giving and engagement technology provider for faith-based organizations, and sold its Bluebridge Tourism unit to Simpleview, which provides sales and marketing technology. All proceeds from the sale were turned around and used to invest complete focus and resources into the Emplify product line. This sale marked as the official transition from Bluebridge Digital., Inc. to Emplify, Inc. Emplify's Employee Engagement Platform In September 2018, Emplify announced that it had raised a $7.5 million in a Series A investment round for its employee engagement platform. The round was led by New Jersey based growth equity investment firm Edison Partners, with participation again from Allos Ventures and Cultivation Capita. With this round of funding, Emplify also announced the roll-out of a new Emplify Partner Program with select talent management and consulting firms. In October 2019, Edison Partners doubled down on their investment into Emplify when the two announced they had completed a $15 million Series B investment round. The round was again aided by investors Allos Ventures and Cultivation Capita. Emplify announced that this round of funding would allow the company to continue product development and expand its sales and marketing teams. As part of the announcement, Emplify also revealed that it had grown year-over-year revenue by an average of more than 275% since its founding in 2016.

It is ‚Äòan integral part of the engine that, together with the energy and motivation of staff, provides the momentum that makes programmes live‚Äô.Epstein, A, Larner, M and Halpern, R. 1995. A Guide to Developing Community-Based Family Support Programs. Ypsilanti, Michigan, High/Scope Press. It follows therefore that the quality of a programme is greatly influenced by the quality of its curriculum. In early childhood, these may be programmes for children or parents, including health and nutrition interventions and prenatal programmes, as well as centre-based programmes for children.  Curriculum approaches  There is no single curriculum that is ‚Äòbest‚Äô for all situations. However, a comparison of different curricula shows certain approaches to be generally more effective than others. For example, High/Scope conducted longitudinal research of children in programmes using three different curriculum models: * The Direct Instruction model, in which teachers initiated activities using academic goals. * The traditional Nursery School model, in which teachers responded to activities that children initiated, with a minimum of structure. * The Reggio Emilia or HighScope model, in which teachers and children both initiated activities. Teachers arranged the room and the daily routine so that children could plan, do and review their activities, while teachers provided support as needed. By following the pathways over many years of children who began all three programmes, Schweinhart and WeikartSchweinhart, L. and Weikart, D. 1997. Lasting Differences: The High/Scope Preschool Curriculum Comparison Study through Age 23. Ypsilanti, Michigan, High/Scope Press. determined that the High/Scope model was most effective, and that children in the Direct Instruction model were most likely to have behaviour and social problems later in life. These are significant findings for curriculum designers in both developed and developing nations as the High/Scope model has been adapted for use in countries around the world. Schweinhart and Weikart concluded that the goals of early education should not be limited to academic preparation for school, but should also include helping children learn to make decisions, solve problems and get along with others. The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) has also identified the following indicators of effective curricula:National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and National Association of Early Childhood Specialists in State Departments of Education (NAECS/SDE). 2003. Early Childhood Curriculum, Assessment, and Program Evaluation: A Joint Position Statement. www.naeyc.org/positionstatements * Children are active and engaged * Goals are clear and shared by all * Evidence-based * Valued content is learned through investigation, play and focused, intentional teaching * Builds on prior learning and experiences * Comprehensive * Professional standards validate the curriculum‚Äôs subject matter * The curriculum is likely to benefit children  Curriculum development and implementation  = A cross-sector approach = Comprehensive programmes addressing health, nutrition and development have proven to be the most effective in early childhood, especially in programmes directed at very young and vulnerable children.Engle, P. 2009. Growing global evidence. In Woodhead, M. and Oates, J. (eds). Effective Early Childhood Programmes. Vol. 4 of Early Childhood in Focus. Milton Keynes, The Open University.UNESCO. 2012. EFA Global Monitoring Report. Policy Paper 03. April 2012. This requires a genuine commitment from agencies and individuals to work together, to plan projects collaboratively, and to involve parents and communities. At the same time, coordination of a project generally rests with one sector. For curricula, this is typically education, although for very young children the health sector may be better positioned. YanezYanez, L. 2011. Quality Learning at Scale. Early Learning: Lessons from Scaling up. Early Childhood Matters, 118. The Hague, Bernard van Leer Foundation. comments that a major finding of the Bernard van Leer Foundation is that learning during the first three years should not be the exclusive domain of the education sector. ‚ÄòWhile all sectors must work together, the primary responsibility should be on the health sector, which is better positioned to reach and adapt to the vulnerability of target populations‚Äô. A cross-sector approach is not without challenges. Divergent expectations of key stakeholders, competing demands on their time, lack of trust, inexperience with ECCE and lack of prior experience in working across sectors can demand immense efforts to build a workable platform for collaboration. = Adapting versus developing = Considerable expertise is required to develop an effective curriculum, one that is not just a collection of activities, but also addresses philosophical and pedagogical concerns. Adapting a proven, commercially available curriculum can be an acceptable option. However, the philosophy, values and approaches of that curriculum must be suited to the children served by the programme. ‚ÄòTo make a well-informed choice, staff (and other stakeholders) need to identify their program‚Äôs mission and values, consider the research and other evidence about high-quality programs and curricula, and select a curriculum based on these understandings‚Äô. Even then, the selected curriculum is likely to require extensive modifications if it is to be effective in the new context. With reference to Hong Kong, Singapore and Shenzhen pre-schools, Li et al.Li, H., Rao, N. And Kam Tse, S. 2012. Adapting western pedagogies for Chinese literacy instruction. Early Education and Development, Vol. 23, No. 4, pp. 603-21. caution that: ‚Äòusing Euro-American norms to unify the learning of young children under varying contexts is absolutely an impossible mission. Best pedagogies could be adapted or assimilated into another society but could never be directly transplanted‚Äô. = Beliefs, values and principles = In a multicultural society a diversity of beliefs, values and perspectives emerge. This can create considerable tension and introduce many challenges for curriculum writers. Foremost amongst these is the tension between perceptions of young children as passive learners, dependent on adults for instruction, and perceptions of children as active constructors of their own learning.Katz, L. Curriculum Disputes in Early Childhood Education. ERIC Clearinghouse on Elementary and Early Childhood Education. EDO-PS-99-13. Proponents of the former generally favour a more academic and prescriptive pre-school curriculum with formal teaching of the alphabet and other basic skills, while those supporting a ‚Äòconstructivist‚Äô approach encourage children‚Äôs active engagement with materials and people; they support a more open curriculum, with emphasis on offering children diverse opportunities and materials from which they can construct their own learning. Space can be created in curricula to honour and reflect divergent stakeholder views. For example, children in most indigenous and oral communities learn a lot by listening and watching, and by direct instruction. The skills of reciting, performing and memorisation may be valued and emphasised within some social groups and countries. These can be acknowledged and nurtured within a curriculum, even in one that promotes child-centred, interactive and play-based teaching and learning. At the national level, the onus is on curriculum writers and the team to explore diversity, to identify common ground and to reach a consensus on what is in the best interests of all children. At the community level, educators need the freedom to follow individual pathways while striving to meet goals based on societal norms and values.Oberhuemer, P. 2005. International perspectives on early childhood curricula. International Journal of Early Childhood, Vol. 37, No. 1, pp. 27-37.  Curricula for pre-school  Curricula for pre-school children have long been a hotbed for debate. Much of this revolves around content and pedagogy; the extent to which academic content should be included in the curriculum and whether formal instruction or child-initiated exploration, supported by adults, is more effective. Proponents of an academic curriculum are likely to favour a focus on basic skills, especially literacy and numeracy, and structured pre-determined activities for achieving related goals. Internationally, there is strong opposition to this type of ECCE curriculum and defence of a broad-based curriculum that supports a child‚Äôs overall development including health and physical development, emotional and spiritual well-being, social competence, intellectual development and communication skills.Bennett, J. 2004. Curriculum in early childhood education and care. UNESCO Policy Brief on Early Childhood. No. 26, September 2004. The type of document that emerges from this perspective is likely to be more open, offering a framework which teachers and parents can use to develop curricula specific to their contexts.  Curricula for primary education  Teachers are at the core of education and has a key role in nurturing future generations who are not only critical thinkers, but also informed and empowered actors prepared to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies. Educators and teachers are essential in young people‚Äôs lives, and are central to developing students‚Äô knowledge, attitudes and skills and to teach them how to engage in society both constructively and responsibly. This is done through curriculum and pedagogy. Teachers and teacher trainers in formal school settings at the primary school level play a role in strengthening the rule of law RoL and global citizenship through education by integrating it into their lessons and planning. Such approaches include resources in classrooms, out-of-classrooms and school-family-community engagement. Classroom resources: * Short activities and games; * Single lessons; * Units or projects; * Stories and books. Out-of-classroom resources: * Sport as a teaching resource to improve self-esteem, enhance social bonds and provide participants with a feeling of purpose; * Field trips allow students the opportunity to apply their class- based learning more concretely in their own community. School-family-community engagement resources: * Support of parents and community members can practise actively shaping a society in which everyone can live peaceful, just, safe and fulfilled lives.  Developing nations  In developing nations, programmes for children under three are more likely to be embedded in community-based programmes in which parents are endorsed as the primary teachers of young children and given support to fulfill that role. These programmes generally cater for ages from pre-birth to school entry with the curriculum having goals for both parents and children. They are often accompanied by a training manual and delivered through participatory workshops and other negotiated and community-based activities. Apart from strengthening the role of parents, these programmes respond to gaps that have persisted in the developing world despite global attention to ECCE; i.e. a focus on under threes and servicing the most marginalised children and families. While some incorporate weekly activities for older pre-school children ‚Äì such as A New Day for Kids (ANDK) in Cambodia ‚Äì they are not a substitute for a pre-school programme with a trained teacher who has the skills to plan and implement an effective curriculum.Malkin, J. 2011. Cambodia: A New Day for Kids. ARNEC Connections: Working Together for Early Childhood. Special edition: Noteworthy Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) Practices. This is an important ingredient in high-quality ECCE programmes for pre-school-aged children.

Collections of dried plant specimens are collected from their native habitats, identified by experts, pressed, and mounted onto archival paper. Care is taken to make sure major morphological characteristics are visible. Herbaria documentation provides a record of botanical diversity. Professionals who make decisions about the conservation-restoration of botanical specimens include registrars, curators, and conservators who work on herbarium collections in universities and museums. Herbarium specimens may be susceptible to water damage, mold, pests, unattached specimens, dust, dirt, and damage from improper storage conditions. Preventive conservation can prevent much of the damage that could occur. National Herbarium of Victoria History JH Maiden in Herbarium Royal Botanic Gardens c. 1895 A herbarium is a collection of preserved plant specimens and associated data used for scientific study. Originally, the word \\"herbarium\\" referred to books about medicinal plants. In 1700, French botanist Joseph Pitton de Tournefort used the word to describe a collection of dried plants and Carl Linnaeus continued to use this term in his work which is where the term caught on. Initially, herbarium collections were bound in volumes instead of on individual sheets as it is done today. It is not exactly known how long dry plant specimens last in storage, but with proper conservation, they have been able to last many years. Specimens collected by Linnaeus in the eighteenth century and by Banks and Solander on the Endeavour voyage in 1788 are still excellently preserved. The specimens may be whole plants or plant parts. These will usually be dried and pressed and mounted on a sheet of paper but, depending upon the material, may also be stored in boxes or kept in alcohol or other preservatives. = Types of specimens = Drying herbarium specimens * Pressed and dried: Vascular plant (flowering plants, conifers, ferns) specimens are pressed and dried plants that are mounted on herbarium sheets. Various techniques are used to attach the plants with the most common method of using archival adhesive with heavier portions of the plant supported additionally by linen thread or narrow strips of gum-backed linen tape or polyester film. Specimens are best pressed with moderate pressure, permitting as much air circulation as possible. This is commonly achieved by strapping sheets in a press made of heavy cardboard or plywood. If there are loose seeds or fruits, these are placed in a small fragment packet, which also is glued to the sheet. A label with collection information is glued on the bottom right corner. * Dried: Small bryophytes (mosses, hepatics or liverworts, and hornworts) are dried and placed loose in folded packets. The label is glued on the front of the packet and the packets are filed loosely in boxes, glued to sheets of mounting paper, or placed loosely in folders. *Stored in fluid: Preserved material can be kept in a glass jar filled with preservative fluid. By storing this way, the botanical specimens are maintained in a usable condition by inhibiting enzymatic and microbial attack. This method can be used where drying, pressing and mounting on a herbarium sheet is unsuitable. This method allows for a better three-dimensional arrangement of flower parts or fruits for storage. *Microscope slides: Specimens can be mounted on microscope slides for short term storage, however, there is a greater risk of rapid deterioration from contracting, darkening, or crystallizing specimens. Slides should be checked on an annual basis to check the condition of preserved specimens. *Desiccants and freeze-drying: Silica gel or freeze- drying methods can be applied to specimens that require preservation of the shape of a delicate organ such as a flower. Disadvantages of this technique are that the specimen is especially fragile and lack support. Acid-free tissue is often used for storage. Agents of Deterioration The practice of preventive conservation is the management of fluctuations in temperature, light, relative humidity, pests, and pollutants that can deteriorate museum collections. These factors are considered Agents of Deterioration. Understanding the practice of preventive conservation as well as the Agents of Deterioration is most important when trying to protect, display, and store collections within the conservation field. =Physical Forces= Proper storage in secure and stable shelving will allow for less stress and movement to affect plant collections. Dried and pressed plant specimens can be stored best in archival grade boxes, or tied in bundles in cardboard folders for long-term storage. For collections that may be handled more frequently, specimens can be placed in archival grade plastic sheets placed in ring folders. =Disaster Recovery= Water damage resulting from flooding can result in shrinking, distortion, or staining of plant materials. Unforeseen disasters can occur at any time and disaster recovery planning and materials for herbaria are similar to museums and libraries. Little can be done with burnt specimens and fragmented specimens except to preserve and protect what is left intact. The damage most likely to occur is water damage through natural or man-made flooding, such as roof leakage or fire sprinkler malfunction. Damaged of waterlogged specimens are frozen to delay deterioration and prevent a fungal attack, which gives curators time to evaluate the situation and decide how best to approach the problem. =Pests= Common herbarium pests include: silverfish, book lice (psocids), cigarette or tobacco beetles (Lasioderma), dermestids, drugstore beetles (Stegobium paniceum) A reoccurring threat to the longevity of herbarium specimens is insects, a number of which find dried plants palatable. Historically, various methods have been used to kill insects, which either come in with the plants when they are collected or are in the building where the plants are stored. Pests are commonly treated with two different methods: * Freezing: Using a clear polyester bag, excess air is pushed out and heat sealed with the specimen inside or the specimen can be placed inside polythene bags and sealed with parcel tape. Then it is placed into a normal domestic freezer for at least 14 days at a temperature of ‚àí18 ¬∞C, or for 72 hours if freezing at -30 ¬∞C. * Anoxia: Small anoxic environments starve the pests of oxygen and are created using sealed barrier films and placing oxygen scavengers and RH buffers inside before sealing. An integrated pest management program is cost-effective over time and the best preventive measure against pests. =Fungal attack= The primary risk factor for fungal attack is incomplete drying of specimens, caused either during the specimen preparation process or afterward, or in collections that become wet later through flood, other water damage or improper storage conditions, especially in the tropics. Properly dried plant specimens will not suffer from fungal attack if stored in the correct conditions. During the drying process specimens are particularly at risk if they dry slowly. This happens through poor drying conditions or specimens being wet before being pressed or having water-retaining or succulent parts. Specimens with sugary exudations or large quantities of nectar are also particularly attractive to fungi and need special care during drying to ensure that they dry fast enough to prevent mold growth. If fungal growth occurs on specimens, it can be brushed with 95% ethanol or methylated spirits (denatured alcohol). However, this may alter the specimen for chemical and other investigative research and only kills the fungus present on the specimen, not preventing further problems of fungal growth. = Light = Herbarium specimens are sensitive to visible light and ultraviolet radiation, which can cause fading of biological pigments (fading or shifts in color) and/or damage to chemical bonds (weakened or embrittled). =Theft= To best establish protocols for specimen movement control, a system of documentation can be set up to monitor and control collections. At the National Museum of Natural History, theft is prevented by maintaining limited access to where collections are stored. In the event of a specimen leaving the site through outgoing loans, records are kept which gather letters of request, the transmission of names, and other supporting documentation. =Pollutants= Storage in metal cabinets is the best material to maintain herbaria collections. Metal cabinets do not release volatile organic compounds as wooden cabinets do. The metal shelves can be easily cleaned and a well-sealed cabinet will provide a stable microclimate for the specimen. =Disassociation= Ensuring that every specimen has an individual accession number will reduce the risk of disassociation. The accession number relates that number to an identifiable object and the object can only be moved if its location is updated, ensuring the object is never disassociated from its data. Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the species to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight folder that is labeled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger folders by genus. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic family according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets. Locating a specimen filed in the herbarium requires knowing the nomenclature and classification used by the herbarium. It also requires familiarity with possible name changes that have occurred since the specimen was collected, since the specimen may be filed under an older name. Modern herbaria often maintain electronic databases of their collections. Many herbaria have initiatives to digitize specimens to produce a virtual herbarium. These records and images are made publicly accessible via the Internet when possible. Repair and restoration Pressed and dried specimen with linen tape supports. Prior to beginning the process of restoration of an herbarium sheet, best practices suggest that the original mounted specimen be photographed for reference to ensure a new sheet is as close to the original as possible. The original mounting sheet can be dried and flattened in the same manner as the plant to serve as a reference for positioning the specimen on a new sheet. Additionally, any labels or supplement information accompanying the plant should be placed in the same place. =Cleaning= Dust and dirt are removed from herbarium sheets by using a smoke sponge. Conservators gently rub the place where the dirt is and then softly remove any excess with a fine brush. Care must be taken by conservators when dealing with older prepared specimens that may have traces of toxic chemicals. Making use of personal protective equipment by professionals can reduce risk of exposure or harm due to dangerous materials. = Broken specimens= Broken specimens are reattached to the herbaria sheet using thinly cut strips of archival pre-gummed linen tape. Detached materials such as seeds or leaves are placed in an acid-free card fragment packet, which is secured onto the sheet with the original specimen. = Removal from mounting sheet = Unattached specimens are removed from the herbaria sheet by humidifying it to make them pliable and removing the plant with a paper lifter (smooth wooden spatula). They are then placed to dry and flatten along with the original mounting sheet and written documentation (label and annotations). The specimen and original documents are then remounted to a new sheet using the original sheet as reference.

His studies was a different vision on one traditionally followed in Portugal, he had translated a large part from Portuguese and had been influential in the development of Portuguese historiography. Biography Ruge was born in the Frisian town of Dorum located near Geestem√ºnde in which was the Electorate of Hanover. His father of Christoph August Ruge (1790-1834) was from Neuhaus/Oste and was a doctor in medicine. During the Battle of Waterloo, he was an English field doctor, he later moved to Cuxhaven and in 1817, he was physician in Dorum, there he later married the lawyer's daughter Elise Hennings (1804-?). Ruge later studied in G√∂ttingen and Halle. In 1872, he became professor in geography and ethnography at the Technische Hochschule de Dresden (Dresden Technical High School) where he headed until his death. He later married Anna Caecilie Busse (1830‚Äì1903) and had children including Frieda Elisa (1860-?), Reinhold Friedrich (1862-?), Walther Karl Theodor (1865-?, geographer) and Elsbeth Sophie (1870-?). He took charge of producing the second edition of the review and enlarged Geschichte der Erdkunde , by Peschel, published in 1887 which he earned him a recognition and consideration of geographers and historians of the time. One work that was most personal Geschichte des Zeitalters des Entdeckungen (History During the Age of Discovery), made between 1881 and 1883 in the Oncken Collection, enshrined his reputation as a geography historian.Annales de G√©ographie (Annals of Geography), 1904, vol; 13, no. 68 Ruge started to revise and actualized numerous works about its essays. In 1878, he published Die Geschichte der Erdkunde (History of Geography), founded by Oscar Peschel and in 1887, Die Erdbeschreibung (Description of the Land) founded by Franz Heinrich Ungewitter. He published numerous works, published a large numerous of books related to geographic history, it includes an important study from 1903 about Portuguese discoveries in Africa as well as the Azores. He was one of the most listened critics in the area of historiography of European expansion, with the notable erudition on the security of his options. He intensely contributed to periodicals including Petermanns Mittelungen and Jahrbuch de Wagner (Wagner Yearbook), where he left and important scattered contribution. In 1863, he founded the Dresden Geographic Society (Dresdner Verein f√ºr Erdkunde) alongside Karl Andree (sometimes as Karl Andr√©e), which he headed for around three decades. He was also member of the Kgl. S√§chsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu Leipzig (Kingdom of Saxony Academy of Sciences of Leipzig) and the Saxon Academy of Sciences (S√§chsischen Akademie der Wissenschafte) and many other geographic societies in Germany and abroad.

Initially, it was proposed as an explanation to increased response for a habituated behavior by introducing an external stimulus; however, upon further analysis, the focus was conclusively established that a proper analysis of dishabituation should be taken into consideration only when the response is increased by implying the original stimulus. Based on studies conducted over habituation's dual-process theory which attributed towards dishabituation, it is also determined that the latter was independent of any behavioral sensitization. An example of dishabituation is the response of a receptionist in a scenario where a delivery truck arrives at 9:00AM every morning. The first few times it arrives it is noticed by the receptionist, and after weeks, the receptionist does not respond as strongly. One day the truck does not arrive, and the receptionist notices its absence. When it arrives the next day, the receptionist's response is stronger when it arrives as expected.  History  The phenomenon was studied by an early scientist Samuel Jackson Holmes in 1912, while he was studying the animal behavior in sea urchins. Later in 1933, George Humphrey‚Äîwhile studying the same effects in human babies and extensively over lower vertebrates‚Äîargued that dishabituation is in fact the removal of habituation altogether, to a behavior that was not conditioned to begin with.  Mechanism  = In humans = According to the dual-process theory of habituation, dishabituation is characterized by an increase in responding to a habituated stimulus after introducing a deviant, to sensitize a change in arousal. For example, when hearing the ticking of a clock and the clock makes a louder ticking sound, you pay more attention to the clock even though you are already familiar with a clock. Further investigations into elicitation and habituation of the electrodermal orienting reflex also showed that dishabituation is independent of sensitization for indifferent stimuli. A meta-analysis shows that dishabituation is improvised on preterm infants as compared to term infants based on the magnitude of stimulus sensitized.  Biological basis  As per the Center for Neural Engineering, University of Southern California (Los Angeles), the primordial hippocampus plays an important role in modeling the dishabituation of behavioral response. According to this, the interaction of two processes is dynamically postulated based on synaptic plasticity, which acquires both long and short-term forgetting. Along with that, cumulative shrinking is proposed to map responses from the temporal region of the anterior thalamus that references the spatial positions. The plasticity model combined with the structure of medial pallium model provides a structured network of neural mechanisms, contributing towards dishabituation and habituation alike. Accordingly, this phenomenon is neither indicative to counteract the emphasis of an existing habituation but instead, organizes an independent neuronal process, nor resulted by facilitation, as the etymology may indicate. = In animals = * Studies done on the Aplysia to establish dishabituation or superimposed sensitization, to understand their neuronal mechanisms of their gill-withdrawal reflex, and dishabituation processes to establish large-scale methodology to solve major limitation problem. * The Tritonia diomedea for its escape swim (the number of cycles per swim) and the Drosophila melanogaster * Auditory stimulation to understand the escape behavior in hermit crabs * Exercise as a dishabituating stimulus on hypoglycemic rodents All the above establish the process of dishabituation, where responding to a repetitive stimulus increases and has been documented in a wide range of organisms - from single-celled animals to primates - which is thought to allow an organism to reflexively either filter out or consider, all forms of information. It is also characterized as an emancipation of an existing prey-catching behavior. Sometimes however, the inconsistency in dishabituation of behavioral response is brought-on by mismatch between the 1st and 2nd stimuli, which in-turn is due to the occurrence of inhibition by habituation, to the existing stimulus.  Application  Dishabituation shows an increase in reward effectiveness as it produces a heightened behavioral response to sensitization of arousal. Other studies also show that it is caused by mind-wandering, where with distributed working process as opposed to practising in mass, the learning behavior is enhanced. In the development of preterm infants, the dishabituation process also provides with an approach for the early diagnosis of cognitive status and most importantly, their mental faculties performances.

The fish also occurs in the Atrato River.Leporinus muyscorum - FishBase In the Manso River in Caldas, at depths of , the fish is abundant. Leporinus muyscorum The species has been classified as a Vulnerable species, due to intense overfishing. Its longevity is six to seven months, and three generations thus correspond to no more than 1.5 years. In 8 years, catch rates in the Atrato River have declined by 90%. Although catch rates are lower in other parts of its range, they have increased in the past few years. It is thus suspected that between 30 and 50% of the population has disappeared in 10 years due to overfishing.

Dillashaw was expected to take place at this event, possibly as the headliner. However, on May 23, Garbrandt withdrew due to a back injury and the bout was scrapped. A UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between current champion Amanda Nunes and multiple-time muay thai world champion Valentina Shevchenko was scheduled to headline this event. The pairing met previously in March 2016 at UFC 196, with Nunes winning by unanimous decision. However, the bout was canceled just hours before the event started due to Nunes being ill. An interim UFC Middleweight Championship bout between 2000 Olympic silver medalist and former world champion in freestyle wrestling Yoel Romero and The Ultimate Fighter: The Smashes welterweight winner Robert Whittaker was expected to serve as the co-headliner. Due to the cancelation of the Nunes-Shevchenko bout, this fight was announced as the new main event. A welterweight bout between former UFC Welterweight Champion Robbie Lawler and former UFC Lightweight Championship challenger Donald Cerrone was originally booked for UFC 205. However, Lawler pulled out to take a little more time after losing his title via knockout at UFC 201. The fight was rescheduled to take place at this event. Reports began to circulate on June 28 that Cerrone had sustained a minor injury and that the pairing would be left intact, but expected to shift to UFC 214 three weeks later. UFC President Dana White confirmed later that Cerrone in fact had a staph infection and a pulled groin, and while the plan was to keep the bout, it wouldn't happen at UFC 214. In the end, the bout was confirmed on July 2 for UFC 214. Alan Jouban was expected to face Brian Camozzi at the event. However, on June 6, it was announced that Jouban pulled out due to a broken foot. He was replaced by The Ultimate Fighter Nations: Canada vs. Australia welterweight winner Chad Laprise. A bantamweight bout between Douglas Silva de Andrade and Rob Font was originally booked for UFC 175 in July 2014. However, de Andrade was pulled from the bout due to injury and replaced by George Roop. The bout was then rescheduled for this event.

Its sound is a mixture of styles such as new wave, electronic music and indie rock. Dorian is considered one of the most nationally-renowned artists in the Spanish music scene. They regularly go on tour in Latin America and European countries like France and Portugal. As of now they have recorded 6 albums: 4 studio albums with original songs, an unplugged album named ‚Äò‚ÄôDiez a√±os y un d√≠a‚Äô‚Äô (featuring acoustic versions of their most successful songs) and a CD which was recorded during their concert at Arenal Sound Festival, in 2015. The band was formed by Marc Gili (main composer and lyricist), Belly Hern√°ndez (piano, synthesizers, arrangements and vocals) and Bart Sanz (bass). The other two main members are Lisandro Montes (synthesizers, guitar, arrangements and vocals) and V√≠ctor L√≥pez (drums). In recent years, some of their songs like Cualquier otra parte, Para√≠sos artificiales and La tormenta de arena have become hits and have received millions of views in YouTube.  History  = Early years = At the beginning of the 2000s, Barcelona had a lively music scene, in both the rock & pop and electronic genres. Marc Dorian, Belly Hern√°ndez and Bart Sanz (three musicians linked to the independent scene) decided to start a project the sound of whichwas a combination of new wave elements from the 80s and electronic sounds from the 90s and 2000s. That is why some of the earliest influences of the band were groups like Radio Futura, Nacha Pop, Aviador Dro, New Order, The Cure, The Chameleons, Dntel and The Postal Service. It was not easy for Dorian at the beginning. They went for a sound based on the mixture of synthesizers and guitars and lyrics in Spanish, but the underground musical scene was mostly dominated by rock in English. Nevertheless, the band made their way step by step winning demo competitions, like the one organized by the Zorrock Festival in which the band won against 1500 contestants. The band's first forays abroad were at festivals like the MIFOC (Balkans) and the Maus H√°bitos (Portugal). Between 2003 and 2004 Dorian performed in many Spanish cities. This tour helped the band to be recognized just before they released their first album. = 2004: 10.000 metr√≥polis = 10.000 metr√≥polis is the title of their debut album. Critics praised their work and the band had its own place in the musical scene. Songs like Solar or Te echamos de menos (which is about the death of a young person) became underground hits which are still being played in indie clubs. Between 2005 and 2009, Te echamos de menos was included on 12 compilation albums. In 2005 this debut album was reissued named 10,000 metropolis Vs. 10,000 metropolis remixes, including a second album of remixes of the songs performed by some of the best DJs in the music scene at the time, among which were DJ Undo (Razzmatazz / The Loft), Ferenc (Nitsa - Apolo) and Dj Coco (Nitsa - Apolo). In 2006 Dorian toured the best clubs and festivals in Spain. Internationally recognized events, such as Benicassim (at which they are regulars), BAM and Primavera Sound, in addition to other events such as Expresa Pamplona, Festival Do Norte, Festival Tendencias, Indirama, Low Cost, Razzmatazz, Apolo, Stereo, and El Cau, allowed the band to perform on big stages and share bills with artists such as Suede, Placebo, Frank Black and Underworld. At the same time, the band began to focus on recording a second album that would unexpectedly end up driving the band's career. = 2007: El futuro no es de nadie = In 2007, Dorian released El futuro no es de nadie, reinforcing its indie musical style composed of electronic melodies, and poetic and politically-motivated lyrics, the anthem of which is the successful single \\"Cualquier otra parte\\", turned into a generational hymn in Spain the importance of which has now reached countries like Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Argentina. This second album resulted in an extensive two-year tour and more than 150 performances, which allowed them to perform at renowned clubs and festivals in Spain, Portugal and the United States. At the moment \\"Cualquier otra parte\\" is considered one of the first songs that obtained massive support thanks to social networks in Spain, without relying on the support of promotional or marketing campaigns. Some lyrics from El futuro no es de nadie, like \\"La playa bajo el asfalto\\", \\"Cualquier otra parte\\" or the title track, were used as slogans by some protesters during the campout of the movement 15-M in Madrid, when the economic crisis that struck the United States and Europe broke out in 2008. = 2009: La ciudad subterr√°nea = The band's third album, titled La ciudad subterr√°nea, was released in 2009 after a tough recording process that lasted 8 months. This album reached the top 30 on the AFYVE sales list and it was rated as the best album of 2009 and the 32nd of the decade in the independent magazine Mondosonoro. With this work, Dorian conquered the dance floors and they managed to consolidate as one of the leading bands in the new independent music scene, formed by groups that have managed to get ahead without submitting to the mercantilist interests of the music industry. La ciudad subterr√°nea took the band to Canada, Argentina, Chile and Mexico, a country where they played in front of thousands of spectators at several festivals and venues, among them the prestigious festival Vive Latino. For the singles from La ciudad subterr√°nea, the band filmed an original trilogy of video clips, with the video producer Crampton, in which the same story of love between young people is narrated as beginning, middle and end. The songs selected for this trilogy of video clips were in this order: La tormenta de arena, Para√≠sos artificiales and La ma√±ana herida, that nowadays are essential songs at any of the band's concerts. This trilogy of video clips has received millions of views on Internet channels like YouTube and Vimeo. After an extensive tour that brought them for the first time to Canada, Argentina and Chile, Dorian ended 2009 with fourteen consecutive hits in Spain and three well-attended concerts in Mexico, in which they accompanied Zo√© and Caf√© Tacvba, two of the most important bands of the Aztec scene. In 2010 Dorian did a joint tour of Spain with Love of Lesbian and continued to visit Mexico, a country in which the band is widely valued and ended up spending much of 2012. The Mexican edition of La ciudad subterr√°nea is edited by Terr√≠colas Imb√©ciles and collaborates with Denise Guti√©rrez (lo blondo) from the band Hello Seahorse! In the song Verte amanecer and by Leon Larregui, the singer of Zo√©, in the song Simulacro of emergencia. =2013: La velocidad del vac√≠o = La velocidad del vac√≠o, the Barcelona band's fourth album, was produced by Phil Vinall, known for his work with bands such as Placebo, Pulp, The Auteurs, Radiohead and Zo√©. The album reached the top 11 in the Spanish sales charts (AFYVE), remaining near the top of the chart for several weeks, and number 3 on ITunes. It was released in countries such as Colombia, Mexico, Argentina and Chile. La velocidad del vac√≠o was recorded and produced in Fatman Studios in Mexico City. This work is distinguished from the rest of the band's productions by its sound, more analogue and direct, in which electronics does not play such a predominant role. In La velocidad del vac√≠o the band also introduced some sounds typical of the United States-Mexico border area, especially in songs like the hit song El tremblor and El sue√±o eterno, considered unanimously by public and critics as two of the best compositions of the band. Los amigos que perd√≠, the first single from La velocidad del vac√≠o, was voted by the musical press of Spain, Mexico and Colombia as one of the best songs of 2013. = 2015: Diez a√±os y un d√≠a = In 2015 Dorian celebrated their first ten years as a band with a special album: Diez a√±os y un d√≠a. It's an unplugged album in which the band reinvented in an acoustic key some of their most iconic themes, such as Cualquier otra parte, Verte amanecer, El temblor, Los amigos que perd√≠ and La tormenta de arena. They round off the album with two unreleased tracks: Arrecife (which opens the album) and Ara, a song sung in Catalan, in which the band tackles the profound disconnection that is being experienced in Europe and Spain between the political class and the citizens. Diez a√±os y un d√≠a shows a rare instrumental display in contemporary music that includes pianos, cello, violins, wind instruments, theremin, harpsichords, acoustic and electric guitars, mandolins, percussion and even the harmonious timbre of the ronroco, an instrument made of rope originating in the Southern Cone of America that belongs to the charangos family. The album includes a version of Los amigos que perd√≠ sung as a duet with Santi Balmes, lead singer of Love of Lesbian, and El temblor, which features the collaboration of Mexican singer Marion Sosa, member of the Mexican duet Love la femme. Diez a√±os y un d√≠a was top 9 in Spain and has been released in numerous countries. The band is currently immersed in an intense tour of Spain and much of Latin America. They recently released the video of the other version included in Diez a√±os y un d√≠a, starring the prestigious actors Daniel Br√ºhl (Inglorious Bastards, Good Bye, Lenin!, Rush, Captain America: Civil War) and Maria Valverde (Three Meters above the sky, Exodus, now or never). Directed in quality film by Alexandre Treg√≥n, the video shows the origin of an infectious love between both protagonists, who are found again through the music of Dorian after a separation.

Her work advocates for the equality and dignity of the oppressed and misused, including Native Americans, women, and the environment. She is most known for her female native figures pieces, combining her scientific education and creative talents to create abstract yet accurate body portraits. O'Leary's latest work was a collage series advocating for the poor environmental state of Oregon's Tillamook Bay. Background Diane O‚ÄôLeary was born in Waco, Texas to an Irish father and Comanche mother. Growing up during the Great Depression developed her artistic craft and style, learning to be thrifty and resourceful with what was available. These experiences were the base to her later artistic career, being recognized internationally for her weaving, quilting, lithography, printmaking and tapestry art. O‚ÄôLeary was a noted piano prodigy as a child and later went on to study Baroque literature in college. She also studied nursing and archaeology. Despite all her continued education which included Texas Christian University (BA, BS, MS), Bacone College, Harvard University (MS), and Stanford University (MA, MFA, PhD), O‚ÄôLeary never had institutional training in the fine arts. She nevertheless managed to intertwine her artistic passions into her scholarly studies. While a nurse, she became a medical artist, drawing what she observed in surgeries and creating technology to improve the procedures. She also conducted environmental research on Oregon's Tillamook Bay for a Congressional proposal for wetland preservation. Art work O‚ÄôLeary's involvement with the Tillamoock Bay proposal inspired her to create a collage series promoting the Bay's wildlife entitled The Living Waters of Tillamook Bay. Congress accepted her proposal and her collage series became its own exhibit at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in 2005. The project was conducted in the ancient Japanese printing technique called Gyotaku. She learned Japanese during this time in order to communicate personally with Japanese Gyotaku artists. O‚ÄôLeary's style borders on the abstract yet keeps to the proportionate makeup of her subjects, combining her scientific and artistic techniques. O'Leary periodically studied under famed Bacone College art instructor, Dick West, which was the extent of her formal art training. O‚ÄôLeary studied under the guidance of professional artists while living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. These artists included Emil Bisttram, Eric Gibberd, and Linton Kistler, who she developed further painting skills and learned lithography from. O‚ÄôLeary's interactions with Georgia O'Keeffe, influenced O‚ÄôLeary's botanical pieces. Other's such as Helen Frankenthaler and Louise Nevelson influenced her art's modernist flair. O‚ÄôLeary took these influences and combined them with her personal style, allowing her own cultural heritage to be presented. She is best known for her figure studies of Native American women, representing them in their historical context through her own non- traditional style. Her work advocates for the equality and dignity of the oppressed and misused, including Native Americans, women, and the environment. Accomplishments O‚ÄôLeary's work has been displayed internationally in public galleries as well as private collections. Her pieces have been included in collections throughout the United States including the National Estuary Program in Washington D.C. Her work has also been used in television shows and film sets.

It was then held by a number of different families including the Cockeram, Cruwys and Grant families. Hillersdon House was built in the nineteenth century by the Grant family and is still in use. History = Placename = The name probably means Hildhere's hill; dun means hill in Old English. The name Hild is first found in the 7th century and the hill referred to may be the tumulus in Hillersdon Wood.Colvin and Moggridge, section 1.1 =Odo FitzGamelin= In the time of Edward the Confessor, the manor was held by Sheerwold and the Domesday Book of 1086 lists the manor of HILESDONE as the 18th of the 24 Devonshire holdings of Odo FitzGamelin, one of the Devon Domesday Book tenants-in-chief of King William the Conqueror. He was the son-in-law of Theobald FitzBerner, another of the Devon Domesday Book tenants-in-chief. The lands of both men later formed part of the feudal barony of Great Torrington.Thorn and Thorn, part 2 (Notes), Chapters 36 & 42 His tenant at Hillersdon was Reginald.Thorn and Thorn, Chapter 42:18 In the Book of Fees (13th century) it is listed as held from the feudal barony of Great Torrington.Thorn and Thorn, Part 2 (notes), 42:18 =de Hillersdon= Arms of Hillersdon: Argent, on a chevron sable three bull's heads cabossed of the fieldVivian, p.469 In 1166 Hillersdon was held by Daniel de Brailega from William de Toriton. The estate was the seat of the de Hillersdon family from the thirteenth century.Pole, pp.187, 308Colvin & Moggridge, 2011, section 1.3 As was common, they had taken their surname from their seat. For a time the manor was held in two parts - East and West Hillerson. In 1241 Roger de Hele and William de Hilderesdon were the tenants, and in 1303 Roger de Hele and Roger de Hillesldon are returned as the tenants, while in 1346 Roger de Hillerysdon had both East and West Hillersdon. In 1456-57 Andrew Hillersdon (d1476) was Sheriff of Devon.Colvin & Moggridge, 2011, section 1.4 According to the Heraldic Visitations of Devon Andrew Hillersdon (son and heir of Robert Hillersdon (d.1499)) , married Anne Edgecombe, \\"daughter and heir of Sir Richard Edgecombe of Edgecombe\\" and widow of Sir William Trevanion of Caerhays. The Edgcumbe pedigree in the Heraldic Visitations of Devon however lists no \\"Sir Richard Edgecombe of Edgecombe\\" who left female heiresses at this date, and the estate of Edgcumbe in the parish of Milton Abbot remained in the Edgcumbe family until at least 1725.Vivian, pp.324-5, pedigree of Edgcumbe) His son Roger Hillersdon, married into the prominent Fortescue family. Following these favourable marriages, the Hillersdon's sold the manor and moved elsewhere in the early 16th-century. Pole states \\"beinge advanced by their matches in diverse howses they left their dwellinge heere & removed unto their other howses of better valewe & sold this land away\\".Pole, p.308 The seat of Roger Hillersdon, was Membland in the parish of Holbeton, Devon, where his descendants remained for several generations.Colvin & Moggridge, 2011, section 1.5 After the dissolution of the monasteries, the manors of Cullompton and Upton Weaver were granted to Sir George St. Leger. His son Sir John St. Leger sold them to Thomas Risdon and it was then held by the Hillersdons. Later the manor of Cullompton (or a share of it) seems to have belonged to the owners of the Hillersdon estate along with that of Ponsford (another manor in the parish of Cullompton).Colvin & Moggridge, 2011, section 1.8-1.9 =Cockeram= Arms of Cockeram: Argent, on a bend sable three leopard's faces of the field In the early seventeenth century, Risdon states that Hillersdon was the seat of \\"Mr Cockrane\\", whose father and grandfather had also held it.Risdon, p.87Colvin and Mogridge, section 1.6 The Cockeram family descended from George Cockeram (d.1577) of \\"Hunington\\" in Devon, one of the overseers of John Lane‚Äôs will. In 1573 he was identified as a merchant. The son of George Cockeram (d.1577) was also called George and was the first to be styled \\"George Cockeram of Cullompton\\". He died in 1586. Therefore the Cockerams might have purchased the estate directly from the Hillersdons in the early sixteenth century. In Queen Elizabeth's reign George and John Cockram, merchant, (probably a brother or cousin of George) supplied arms and armour for the defence of the realm. As well as being patrons of the church, the family were great benefactors of the church and George and Bathsheba, the children of David Cockeram each gave the church a communion cup. They also gave a market cross to the town and lands for its upkeep. In 1620 the head of the family was Humprey Cockeram. Robert Cockeram (1554-1632) was the third son of George Cockeram (d.1586) and was a Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford. His monument survives in Cullompton Church.Vivian, p.205-6, pedigree of Cockeram After being released from his duties at Oxford he spent much of his time at his house in 10 acres or at Growen (a farm immediately to the east of Hillersdon). In his will he bequeathed to the young scholars of Cullompton Grammar School, his \\"Cooper's Dictionary\\", to be kept chained to a desk. He also left money for repairs to the church and almshouses. =Prous= Arms of Prouse of Devon: Sable, three lions rampant argent Pole (d.1635), records that Hillersdon was owned by \\"Mr Prous of Taunton\\", Somerset, whose eldest son resided there.Pole, p.187Colvin and Moggridge, section 1.7 Pole, although a contemporary of Risdon, makes no mention of the Cockram tenure although he does state \\"The patrons of the church of Columpton are Willm Every, Esquier, & Henry Cokeram, of Columpton\\".Pole p. 188 It is possible that the estate was sold by the Cockerams to the Prowses in the early 17th century, in which case there would be no conflict between the account of Risdon and that of Pole. The Prouse family was an old Devon gentry family, branches of which were seated at Gidleigh Castle; Chagford; Barnstaple; Tiverton and Exeter. They descended from the marriage of Peter Prouz of \\"Eastervale\\" to Mary de Redvers. She was the daughter and heiress of William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon (d.1217) of Tiverton Castle, and widow of Sir Robert de Courtenay (d.1242) feudal baron of Okehampton.Vivian, p.626, pedigree of Prouse The ownership of Hillersdon in the rest of the seventeenth and early 18th century is unclear.Colvin & Mogride, Section 1.8 = Cruwys = Mature Turkey oak at Hillersdon House. Possibly one of a number planted by Henry Cruwys In 1739, Joanna Burridge, widow of Samuel Burridge of Tiverton, and her daughter Elizabeth sold Hilersdon to Henry Cruwys of New Inn, Middlesex for ¬£3,750.Colvin & Mogride, Section 2.1 During his ownership of the estate he planted a number of oak trees in rows, both English Oaks and Turkey Oaks of a variety known as Iron Oaks which were possibly from the nursery of William Lucombe. Fifty years later, in 1796, a description of the trees and some seedlings were sent to Lord Dartmouth.Gray, Todd, William Luccombe and the Iron Oaks of Hillersden in 1796, Devon Documents (ed. T. Gray). Tiverton: Devon & Cornwall Notes & Queries, Special Issue (1996) pp. 88‚Äì90. Henry Cruwys died in 1760 and was buried at Butterleigh, near to Hillersdon and his wife Jane died five years later. He left his estate to his nephew Thomas Augustus Cruwys, Thomas Putt of Combe and Reverend Samuel Newte of Tidcombe, Tiverton. On Benjamin Donn's 1765 map of Devon, the house is shown as being in the ownership of 'Cruwys Esq'. =Colman= Shortly before 1810 Hillersdon was listed by Rev. John Swete (d.1821) as the seat of Francis Colman (d.1820),Swete, John, Names of the Noblemen and Principal Gentlemen in the County of Devon, their Seats and Parishes at the Commencement of the Nineteenth Century, 1810, published in Risdon, 1811, p.4 who was also lord of the manor of Cullompton.Risdon, p.372, 1810 Additions He was the son and heir of William Colman of Gornhay in Devon and his mother was Jane Seymour, a sister of Edward Seymour, 8th Duke of Somerset (1701‚Äì1757), of Berry Pomeroy in Devon. Francis Colman was one of the beneficiaries of Thomas Augustus Cruwys' estate and he purchased the estate in 1771. In 1793 Richard Polwhele wrote that he had apparently built a new house at Hillersdon.Colvin and Moggridge, sections 2.3 - 2.4 Colman married a Jemima Searle and died in 1820, leaving three daughters and co-heiresses, the eldest of whom married into the Collins and then the Shiell families; the second married into the Pettiward family of Finborough Hall in Suffolk and the youngest Laura-Anne Colman married Thomas-Joseph Trafford of Trafford Park in Lancashire. =Sweet= David Sweet, formerly of Gittisham, Devon, purchased Hillersdon and the manor of Cullompton from Francis Colman in 1802.Colvin and Moggridge, section 2.5 He died in 1807 without making a will and his wife Lucinda remarried. During this period Hillersdon House was let. On the death of her second husband in 1816, John Laxon Sweet (born 1795) inherited and he and his wife, Caroline Mackmurdo moved into Hillersdon.Colvin and Moggridge, section 3.1 As well as owning Hillersdon, John Laxon Sweet was also Lord of the Manor of Cullompton. By the 1820s, no courts were held, but the lord still had some manorial rights including appointing the town crier. Almost as soon as he inherited Hillersdon, John Laxon began to get into debt and by the early 1820s, parts of the estate were mortgaged for thousands of pounds. By 1825, the estate was auctioned although he retained the mansion and its grounds. Eventually, despite financial support from family and friends, he was forced to sell the property. By the time of the tithe survey in 1842, the estate was owned by Thomas Baker and the mansion was occupied by Daniel Roberts.Colvin and Moggridge, sections 3.2 - 3.5 =Grant= William Charles Grant (1817-1877) The estate was purchased in about 1847 by William Charles Grant (1817‚Äì77), a Lieutenant of the First (Kings) Dragoon Guards. He was a nephew of Sir William Grant (1752-1832), Member of Parliament, Solicitor General and Master of the Rolls, who had retired to Barton House, Dawlish, Devon.Colvin & Moggridge, section 4.1 William Charles Grant was lord of the manor of Cullompton. He was descended from a younger son of Alexander Grant of Hillochhead in Scotland, a branch of Grant of Elchies. In 1843 Grant married Maria May (d.1891), a grand-daughter of Joseph May of Membland in Devon and of Hale Park in Hampshire. She was a noted pteridologist,Colvin & Moggridge, Section 4.2 and an adept of the \\"Victorian Fern Cult\\",. At the Royal Horticultural Society's Exhibition of British Ferns held in London in August 1892, her son provided \\"Mrs Maria Grant's Memorial Prize for 10 varieties of Athyrium filix-femina\\", Silver Gilt Flora Medal, in her honour. William Charles Grant also built the present Hillersdon House to replace the earlier house which was in a dilapidated state, and which had been offered for rent in the early 19th century. William John Alexander Grant (1851-1935) Hillersdon passed to his second and eldest surviving son \\"Johnny\\" William John Alexander Grant (1851-1935), JP,Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 15th Edition, ed. Pirie-Gordon, H., London, 1937, pp.954-5, pedigree of \\"grant of Hillersdon House\\" the distinguished Arctic photographer who in 1895 married Enid Maud Forster, a daughter of William Forster (1818-1882), Premier of New South Wales, Australia, whom he divorced in 1901.Colvin & Moggridge, section 4.2 In the 1890s Hillersdon became known for its wild parties. One incident occurred after the Exeter Ball, when four young gentlemen plunged into one of the lakes, and were subsequently washed off in baths of Champagne. Elinor Glyn, a noted society beauty was part of the house party on this occasion. He died in 1935 and his funeral in the town of Cullompton was attended by hundreds of local people. The funeral procession was led by the Devon County Constabulary with one hundred members of the Cullompton Constitutional Club following behind. William Grant had planned his funeral in great detail and even prepared for it by sleeping in his coffin. =Sturgis= After the death of William Grant in 1935 the house was inherited under his will by Sir Mark Beresford Russell Sturgis (1884‚Äì1949), KCB, Assistant Under-Secretary for Ireland, who took the additional surname of Grant, as a condition of the will. In the Second World War it housed US Officers and then became a bed and breakfast and later was divided into five flats. =Glynn= It was purchased in 1982 by David and Gale Glynn, who having undertaken some refurbishment work sold it in 2009 for an asking price of ¬£3 to 4 million.Daily Telegraph newspaper on-line 5 Jun 2009 =Lloyd= The south-west front of Hillersdon House undergoing restoration in 2012 In 2010 Hillersdon was purchased by International business man Michael Lloyd and has since undergone a complete refurbishment and is now used as a wedding venue.

Biography  She was one of eight siblings born to a farming family and spent her youth working on their farm. In 1890, she went to Switzerland and taught German at a boarding school. After brief stays in Paris and London, she went to a farm in Ireland, where her passion for painting was encouraged. After returning to Germany, she began taking formal art lessons in Hannover. This was followed by a trip to Italy, after which she went to live with her sister Anna in Berlin and set up a studio there. She also gave free drawing lessons and began to participate in exhibitions. In 1911, she was back in Italy and visited Sicily. When World War I began, she returned to her home village, where she set up a facility to care for the sick and wounded. She concentrated on scenes from everyday life, landscapes and city views. In addition, she created some religious paintings, commissioned by local churches. Many of her works were painted on cardboard. Her sister, Betty (1875-1928), was also a painter of some note.

Her work is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Chicago Film Archives, the Smithsonian Archives of American Art as well as many other institutions. Personal life Helen Balfour Morrison was born in Evanston, Illinois to Fannie Lindley and Alexander Balfour. Morrison's mother died when she was 17. At age 16 Morrison took a job in a photography studio to help make ends meet. Career One of her first projects was a documentary series of photographs depicting African American life in Great Depression-era Kentucky. In a region near Lexington, she photographed the residents of the small communities of Zion Hill and Sugar Hill. In her late twenties Morrison began the Great Americans series ‚Äî portraits of such Chicago-area notables as Jane Addams, Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow, Amelia Earhart, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Frank Lloyd Wright. However she also shot portraits of ordinary people. Morrison shot these portraits in Chicago and New York, and the series became well-known with exhibitions in museums all over the country. Critic J. B. Newman wrote that Morrison was able to \\"photograph the soul.\\" In 1942, Morrison met dancer and choreographer Sybil Shearer. From that point forward, her work became more focused on documenting Shearer's life and work through an extraordinary production of photographs and films. As time went by, Morrison de-emphasized her own career to help manage and promote Shearer's affairs. The Morrison-Shearer Film Collection, which is administered by the Chicago Film Archives, contains over 400 16 mm films, nearly 200 8 mm films, and 200 quarter-inch audio reels. Morrison-Shearer foundation The Morrison-Shearer Foundation, was established in 1991 and is based in their home in Northbrook, Illinois.

Siegel created LaughTrack, a national magazine about stand-up comedy, and later became a personal manager for comic performers, actors and writers. Most recently, he has created several environmentally-friendly products focused on the dry cleaning industry. He was chosen for induction to the National Conference of Personal Managers Hall Of Fame's class of 2017. Career As a personal manager, his clients included Leah Remini, Rondell Sheridan (That's So Raven, Cory In The House); Ian Gomez (2000 American Latin Media Awards Recipient of Special Achievement for being a series regular on three primetime series at the same time: The Drew Carey Show, Felicity and The Norm Show);Reggie Hayes (Girlfriends), Rosa Blasi (Strong Medicine). He also convinced Craig Ferguson to immigrate to America and represented the Scotsman for over a decade, and he managed Nia Vardalos. Siegel produced her play My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and subsequently helped develop and cause the film My Big Fat Greek Wedding to be produced. In a case brought by Marathon Entertainment (Siegel's management firm) after he sued Rosa Blasi for unpaid commissions and she then petitioned the Labor Commissioner, asking for relief from her contractual obligations based on his alleged actions as a talent agent without the requisite license, the California Supreme Court found that the Labor Commission had wrongly not been incorporating severance when adjudicating Talent Agencies Act controversies. Siegel has written multiple articles related to the TAA that have been published by the Los Angeles Daily Journal, the regional trade paper for the legal field, including one the newspaper titled, \\"A Generation of Incorrect Talent Agencies Act Rulings\\" where Siegel showed how the current interpretation conflicts with four California Supreme court holdings. Rick Siegel founded and edited LaughTrack magazine, which had a 550,000 circulation and was handed to patrons at every major comedy club in the country, similar in manner to how Playbill is distributed to audiences at Broadway Shows. Under Siegel's direction, LaughTrack was the first national publication to write about comic luminaries such as Tim Allen, Larry David, Drew Carey, Ellen DeGeneres,LaughTrack Magazine, March 1989 edition, Pgs. 26-29. Jonathan Katz, and Bill Hicks. LaughTrack debuted in March 1989 and that first issue showcased five new comedians (at that time) in its \\"Breaking Through\\" column. That list included five-time Emmy winner Kevin Rooney, Bill Hicks, Jonathan Katz (Dr. Katz, Private Therapist on Comedy Central), Drew Carey and Larry David. In 2008 Siegel and his wife, Jennie Nigrosh, inventedU.S. Patent No. 3115959 a reusable dry cleaning garment bag and began to market the bag under the banner of The Green Garmento. In 2009, The International Housewares Show honored The Green Garmento with its DESIGN DEFINED 2009 designation and the International Hotel, Motel and Restaurant Show nominated The Green Garmento for one of its Editors' Choice Awards. In 2011, Entrepreneur Magazine called The Green Garmento, \\"One of the 100 Genius Companies To Watch.\\" Siegel and Nigrosh are also co-inventors of the Gargantote (US Patent No. 3369584), a reusable flat-bottomed laundry bag, and the Hawk Hanger, (US Patent No. 9,414,703), a clothes hanger that lowers the carbon footprint, production, shipping and storage costs. Siegel penned a column about business, \\"The High Road,\\" which first was carried by American Drycleaner and later by Cleaner and Laundry, two trade publications for the dry cleaning and laundry industries. He has also written several columns published by The Huffington Post about the 2008 Presidential Election. References *[1] Ferguson, Craig (2009).

Canopy is Hilton's twelfth brand; as of March 2018, approximately thirty properties were under development in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2019, it has 13 locations with 2,104 rooms in 5 countries and territories, including three that are managed with 529 rooms and ten that are franchised with 1,575 rooms. History Prior to announcing the Canopy brand in October 2014, Hilton conducted several years of research and consumer testing by surveying more than 9,000 American, British, and Chinese travelers to help shape the concept. During this time, the brand also experienced a \\"false start\\" that set its launch back by at least two years, the result of a 2010 legal settlement with Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which alleged that Hilton gained possession of its documents related to lifestyle brand development. Though Hilton did not admit to any wrongdoing, the company agreed to a payment to Starwood and to delay the brand's launch by two years. Hilton initially confirmed plans for eleven properties in Europe and the United States. In 2015, Canopy by Hilton confirmed it was developing properties in eight American cities and Iceland. Hilton announced plans to develop a Canopy property in San Antonio in 2016. Hilton's goal is to have 100 properties open or in development in both major metropolitan areas and mid-size cities within five years of the brand's launch. Hilton announced plans to develop a Canopy property in Sioux Falls in 2022. Properties The first Canopy by Hilton hotel opened in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, in July 2016. The first two properties in the United States opened in the Washington, D.C. area in early 2018, at The Wharf in Southwest Washington and in Bethesda, Maryland. the company was developing about thirty properties, most in the United States. Around eighty percent are new builds, while the others are planned conversions; the London Canopy hotel, in Aldgate, is a combination of both. Promotion and branding Canopy by Hilton hotels have a local feel, in response to customer testing. Employees are called \\"enthusiasts\\" and beds have a \\"canopy\\" created by a grey headboard that reaches to the ceiling and overhangs. The brand's introductory video features scenes filmed in Baltimore and Istanbul. In November 2014, Hilton Worldwide built two Canopy model rooms at its headquarters in McLean, Virginia, and showcased them to media and press. One showcased new construction, the other a conversion; one illustrated an \\"imaginary\\" room in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, while the other exemplified Reykjav√≠k Canopy. The models were based on feedback from more than 11,000 consumers. The brand uses a bright orange logo and orange accents because it evoked \\"good energy\\" in consumer testing. Employees of the month will be given orange Converse shoes and some properties have orange bicycles available for use.

The classic console version was released on February 24, 2017. The game was released as a hardcopy, physical cartridge complete with manual.  Plot  An evil race of aliens called the Smurgliens has watched Earth for years. Through their observations, they deduce that the best humanity has to offer is its wifi, cat videos, metal music, and coffee. Two baristas from the Black Forge Coffee House, Nick and Ashley, take it upon themselves to confront the threat after their coffee shop is invaded.  Gameplay  Coffee Crisis is a side-scrolling brawler, reminiscent of games like Streets of Rage or Golden Axe. Players fight a variety of aliens and possessed humans, collecting power-ups and earning points, as they progress through numerous levels. Jumping and special maneuvers are also available. The game was designed with cooperative play in mind, and offers two-player support. Players can play as either Nick Miller or Ashley Corts from the Black Forge Coffee House. A PC release of Coffee Crisis is planned for release in April 2018. This version features updated graphics, a new soundtrack, and a host of extra features, such as a special difficulty mode, integration with streaming platforms, and procedurally generated modifier items that change the gameplay on each playthrough.  Development  The game started out when the owner of Mega Cat Studios met Nick and Ashley, the owners of the Black Forge Coffee House, at a fundraiser for the UPMC Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh and decided to collaborate. Out of a shared respect for retro gaming consoles, the owners decided that the game should be released on the Sega Genesis and Mega Drive, especially since Mega Cat Studios already had the equipment necessary to self-publish the game. Coffee Crisis runs on the Sega Genesis's and Mega Drive's original hardware. The Black Forge Coffee House penned the story, while Mega Cat Studios did the art and programming. Pittsburgh metal band Greywalker provided music for the soundtrack. The game features many scenes and locations from around Pittsburgh, including PNC Park, Grandview Boulevard, and the Duquesne Incline. = PC Release = The PC version of the game was released on May 4, 2018 on Steam with updated art, music, and other features, including integration with Twitch and Mixer that allows viewers of the game to interact with the player. The game passed Steam's Greenlight process in under two weeks. This version of the game was later ported to the Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Playstation 4. = Evercade Release = Mega Cat Studios released Coffee Crisis in a compilation cartridge for the Evercade, along with several other titles from the studio, including Little Medusa, Log Jammers, and Justice Duel.  Reception  Coffee Crisis received mixed reception, being praised for its sense of humor, music and inclusion of Pittsburgh locations and music, while being criticized for lack of modern features, such as the ability to block attacks.

Dekker has written opinion pieces and blogs for politically left- wing websites and magazines, and has been an activist for several causes. She is a former GroenLinks party employee in Hilversum. Dekker rose to nationwide prominence in March 2017, after politician Geert Wilders of the Party for Freedom (PVV) spread a message about a July 2016 tweet in which Dekker allegedly advocated for stoning Geert Wilders. Although Dekker claimed the tweet was written \\"sarcastically\\", this resulted in Dekker receiving threats en masse, and she was forced to go into hiding.  Biography  = Early life and education = Anne Fleur Dekker was born on 28 April 1994 in the North Holland town of Blaricum. She grew up in Bussum, and later moved to neighbouring Hilversum, where she went to grammar school. Her father voted CDA, her mother (a sister of MP Robin Linschoten) voted VVD, two conservative parties; but Dekker herself was gradually attracted to leftist politics. In her youth, she was often confronted with injustice, which she desired to counter. After seeing Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth (2006), she decided to sign up for DWARS, the youth wing of GroenLinks. In May 2016, she became a party volunteer for the local Hilversum GroenLinks department. After controverse the party decided not to support her as Dekker stated. GroenLinks did not give a reaction . As of October 2016, Dekker studied but not know what degree or if she finished her study, and often took part in public protests. Some of these were questionable. By then, she said, she \\"often received criticism, ranging from 'unworldly leftist weirdo' to actual death threats.\\" = Environmentalism and political protests = Dekker reflects on her experiences during the Rot op met je milieu show. Dekker thinks it is important for children to be educated about environmental issues, such as recycling. When she was in primary school, the class once visited a waste processing and sewage company, which had a deep impact on her. In October 2016, Dekker appeared in the four-episode EO television show Rot op met je milieu (\\"Get Lost With Your Environment\\"), in which she took up the position of environmental activist.All episodes of Rot op met je milieu at NPO.nl In scenes on a fishing boat and at a pig farm, she was seen crying over the suffering and maltreatment of animals (\\"I don't want this to exist!\\"). The other participants especially sympathised with her on the needless killing of non-consumable fish in the form of bycatch. During Veggie Fair on 23 October 2016 in Lisserbroek, Dekker gave a talk on effective activism. On 4 December, during VegFest 2016, Dekker lectured about her experiences during Rot op met je milieu, and about veganism and activism in general. On 22 December, Dekker held a plea to stop eating meat during a \\"peace service for the animals\\" in the Vrijburg Church in Amsterdam. On 20 January 2017, Dekker was part of the Women's March demonstration by several hundreds of people against American president Donald Trump (inaugurated that day), and against Geert Wilders, at the Museumplein in Amsterdam, \\"because they claim to serve the common man, but they don't actually do so,\\" and were using Mexicans, Muslims and refugees as scapegoats. In response to Trump's controversial travel and immigration ban, passed on 27 January, Dekker organised a protest on 29 January at Schiphol Airport, to \\"show our solidarity with all the people who are currently stuck, or are unjustly stopped from travelling to the United States. Lots of these people, whom Trump is now refusing entry, have got visa, a job and a house, and now all of the sudden they're rejected because of this bizarre measure.\\" They wanted to protest against the way in which KLM was complying with Trump's travel ban, and had prevented some passengers from boarding planes to the US based on their nationality. When setting foot inside the terminal, the protesters, numbering a few dozen, were removed by the Marechaussee (according to Dekker, this happened \\"brutally\\"; some people allegedly fell down and received minor injuries), because they were only allowed to protest outside the terminal, not inside. On 15 April 2017, Dekker spoke at and participated in a Konijn in Nood (\\"Rabbits in Need\\") protest, supported by the Party for the Animals, against a rabbit breeding company in Moergestel. The animal rights activists demonstratively destroyed rabbit cages with sledgehammers, marched with torches and beating drums, and held a one-minute silence for the 'animal hell' to which they claim these rabbits were subjected. In July 2017, Dekker participated in the demonstrations against the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit. The weblog she maintained these days was widely read, and received many negative reactions from Dutch right-wing media such as PowNed, who published a scathing piece entitled \\"All of Holland Hates Anne Fleur Dekker\\". Much of the criticism focused on the fact that Dekker reported much Neo-Nazi and 'excessive' police violence against leftist activists, but was silent about leftist violent rioting and vandalism (often referred to as \\"black bloc\\" tactics), which she claimed not to have witnessed. = Controversy and in hiding = FvD leader Thierry Baudet PVV leader Geert Wilders On 16 March 2017, one day after the Dutch general election of 2017, during which Thierry Baudet's party Forum for Democracy (FvD) won two seats, Dekker wrote an opinion piece at Joop.nl, which was read about 70,000 times. She claimed that Baudet had justified rape in his description of the manners of Gregor, the main character of Baudet's 2014 novel Voorwaardelijke liefde (\\"Conditional Love\\"), thereby reigniting a controversy that had raged three years ago when the book was first published. Next, on 18 March, the right-wing populist conspiracist website liefdevoorholland.com resurfaced a few earlier online posts of Dekker as well, including an old tweet stemming from 19 July 2016. At the time, Dekker responded to a Belgian woman who had proposed on Facebook to throw stones at a mosque with \\"at least 500 people, as a 'fun action' in response to the radical Muslim violence of the past few nights\\". On 19 July 2016, Dekker tweeted a screenshot of this post with the commentary \\"Fine type this again\\", and next a new tweet saying: \\"Who will join [me] in throwing 500 stones at Wilders? Seems like a 'fun action' to me.\\" Afterwards, she claimed her tweet was intended sarcastically. The website made a collage of an edited photo of Dekker with devil horns and two of her tweets, added an accusation of electoral fraud to the post and demanded a recount. However, contrary to her earlier tweet, Dekker did not preside over any polling place during the 2017 elections. According to the NOS, Hilversum mayor Broertjes had refused this because she had a \\"distinct political profile\\", but Dekker herself claimed she had already indicated two weeks before the elections that she would be too busy. When Wilders spread the link to the liefdevoorholland.com post via Facebook on 19 March 2017, Dekker was soon forced to go into hiding because of countless serious threats and hateful expressions aimed at her via her workplace, at her family, at GroenLinks, and at the city council of Hilversum via Twitter, Facebook and by email. She thought the followers of Wilders and Baudet had \\"provoked\\" each other to threaten her. Allegedly, this was a lot worse because she was a woman, and according to her \\"all the right-wing platforms are now running rampant: GeenStijl, De Dagelijkse Standaard, The Post Online\\". She blamed Wilders, saying that he hadn't put her tweet in the right context. On 27 March, Wilders announced in a tweet he was probably going to report Dekker to the police for the 19 July 2016 tweet, in which she supposedly incited violence against him. Dekker speaks about the hate campaign she was subjected to. At the Joop Caf√© podcast, Dekker said on 24 March: \\"Thierry Baudet [is] more dangerous than Wilders. In my article at Joop, I say that Baudet is a Wilders in sheep's clothing; but by now, my opinion is that he's at least ten times as bad as Wilders. Wilders is a one man show with a group of followers, whereas Baudet is really building a movement. Thanks to that club, I'm now in hiding.\\" On Twitter, she advocated for pieing Baudet. This resulted in even more controversy, because the late right-wing populist politician Pim Fortuyn was pied in 2002 and assassinated four weeks later. In late-night talkshow Pauw on 28 March, host Jeroen Pauw suggested that pieing Baudet or any other politician was an act of violence in itself, and might encourage others to commit murder. Dekker rejected and condemned violence. She stood by her Wilders tweet as \\"cynical\\" and exposing the \\"double standard\\" by which almost nobody condemned the mosque stoning, but everyone was outraged over any threat against Wilders. However, she expressed some regret over the Baudet tweet, which was \\"perhaps not very clever\\" of her, but still said \\"justifying rape\\" was far worse. Former VVD politician Ed Nijpels criticised her behaviour as \\"duplicitious\\", whereas PvdD leader Marianne Thieme defended her right to free speech. On 30 March, Dekker announced she had revoked her GroenLinks membership, because according to her, the party leadership had failed to support her cause. The next day, controversial Het Parool columnist Theodor Holman wrote that Dekker's radical activism turned him on, and he wanted to have sex with her. Dekker reacted furiously that he was a \\"filthy creep\\", that she felt \\"verbally assaulted\\", and called on the newspaper to prevent him from publishing such \\"misogynist locker room columns\\" in the future. In February 2018 she said on Twitter that she was being threatened by her former leftist colleagues because she had become friends with several right- wing politicians. In fact she got into a serious relationship with a well known member of the FVD. She started to meet up with FVD members en even started to go to Baudet‚Äôs FVD book releases/meetings. Paul Vd Bas, author, speaker, boyfriend broke up with her. Dekker got a holiday job in Lyon France (2019 summer) for a few months. She called it immigration but came back late 2019.  Writings  Dekker has written for several left-wing media including Joop.nl and De Socialist, a monthly publication by the International Socialists.

Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. New Hampshire was won by the Democratic nominees, New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson and Indiana Governor Thomas R. Marshall. Wilson and Marshall defeated incumbent President William Howard Taft, and his running mate Vice President James S. Sherman and Progressive Party candidates, former President Theodore Roosevelt and his running mate California Governor Hiram Johnson. Wilson won New Hampshire by a very narrow margin of 2.05%, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate since New Hampshire native Franklin Pierce in 1852 to win the state or populous Hillsborough and Strafford Counties. He was the first Democrat since Grover Cleveland in 1892 to carry any of New Hampshire‚Äôs counties, the first since Cleveland in 1888 to carry Merrimack and Rockingham Counties, the first since to win Belknap County since Cleveland in 1884, and the first to gain a majority in Grafton County since Winfield S.

Born in what is now Germany he moved to France to fight alongside the English during the Hundred Years War. When a truce was agreed between England and France at Br√©tigny in 1360 he formed, with other demobilised soldiers of fortune such as the Englishman John Hawkwood, a company of mercenaries originally named the Great Company. Later to be known as the White Company it recruited unemployed veteran English, German and Gascon soldiers and, like other similar groups (or companies), it survived initially by extortion, threatening to ravage towns if not bought off. Starting in the Champagne district they worked their way south and set up a base only 25 miles from Avignon, where the Pope of that time lived. There they extorted 100,000 florins from the Pope after promising not to attack and to leave the area. The Pope suggested they might like to go to Italy to give military aid to the Marquis of Montferrat who was feuding with the powerful Visconti family of Milan. The company spent almost a year in Savoy before signing a six-month contract with the Marquis of Montferrat to help him fight the Viscontis. After hearing the Lord of Pavia was sick he teamed up with Luchino Novello Visconti of Genoa to attack the town. Ransoms for captured townspeople brought in 180,000 florins. Further attacks on numerous other towns followed. In April 1363 he finally confronted the rival Great Company of Konrad von Landau who were under contract to the Viscontis. At the Battle of Canturino bridge near Romagnano Sesia in Piedmont Sterz's forces overcame the opposition and the injured Landau was captured, dying later that day from his injuries. The Great Company never recovered from its defeat. Sterz then contracted with the town of Pisa to assist them in a war with neighbouring Florence. During the rest of that year his troops attacked several Florentine towns. In mid-1364, owed back-pay by Pisa, Sterz switched sides to fight for Florence, leaving the White Company and joining up with Anichino di Bongardo (Hannekin Baumgarten) to form the Compagnia della Stella (Company of the Star). At the end of 1365 he signed up with the Papal States and suffered a defeat at the hands of the Perugian forces led by his erstwhile colleague Bongardo. In 1366 he signed up himself to defend Perugia. However, accused of treachery by the Perugians, he was arrested and executed in the town in early November. After his death the Compagnia della Stella disbanded.

Al Ostoura is derived from an Arabic word, which means \\"The Legend\\". The series stars Mohamed Ramadan, who played the role of two brothers; Rifaa'i Al Disouqi, and Nasser Al Disouqi. The genre of this series is Action Drama. The story was written by Mohammad Abdul Moti, and directed by Mohammad Sami.  Plot  The story centers around Rifai Al Disouqi (Wird Ikr), a well-known, well-loved man who owns an illegal weapon manufacturing workshop in a Cairo slum. Despite the wealth this brings him, he remains identified with the lower class. Rifai has inherited the factory from his father who established it and is carrying on his father's legacy and supporting his family. The central family consists of Rifai; his wife, Hanan; their two daughters; Rifai's mother, Fat'hiyya; his sister, Samah; and Nasser, his youngest brother. Rifai is also part of a group powerful elites who refer to themselves as the \\"Higher Power\\". Isam Al Nemr, the antagonist, is a competitor who runs a similar illegal weapons factory. He finds Rifai challenging and envies his power and position. Throughout the series, it is made clear that if someone does not abide by the rules of the weapons trading industry, they will be killed. As the story progresses, Rifai decides not to follow an order given to him by the \\"Higher Power\\" and rebels against them. As a consequence of his decision, Rifai is gunned down by a rifle from a passing car. Following the death of Rifai, the focus of the series shifts to his younger brother, Nasser. Unlike his brother, Nasser is an ambitious man who does not want to maintain the family legacy and instead wants to pursue a more stable, safe, and lucrative career. This ambition is furthered by the desire to marry the love of his life, Tamara, which would require he provide a more sophisticated lifestyle. Nasser decides to leave Egypt, moving to another Arab country and applying to work for the Legal Consultancy. Circumstances, however, were set against him and Nassar is forced to return home by his mother's health issues. Upon his return to Egypt, Nassar realizes that his life is getting more complicated and he should take the responsibility of facing one of the most prominent local families. Tamara, the woman Nassar want to marry, decides out of curiosity to visit his family's house to see the manner in which they live and be introduced to them as Nasser's girlfriend. Tamara is surprised to find that Nasser's social class is far beneath her own. This disappointment leads her to plot with her parents to reject Nasser's eventual marriage proposal. After Nassar is rejected by Tamara's parents, his life quickly deteriorates in a series of devastating events including being imprisoned along with two of his uncles due to Rifai's illegal business. During Nasser's imprisonment, the women in his family pay him a visit and explain to him the cruelty and mistreatment they have faced since Isam took Rifai's death and Nasser's absence as an opportunity to seize power. This revelation inspires Nasser to follow his brother's path in joining the \\"Higher Power\\" in order to reclaim their family legacy and return respect and power to his family. He is bailed out by Salmawi; an ex-member of the elite group. Salmawi believes Nassar's unfortunate situation would be a good opportunity to collaborate with a member of the Disouqi family. Even though Nasser did not originally want to follow his brother into the family business, he ends up being an even more powerful weapons' manufacturer than Rifai. Through the business he once spurned, Nasser is able to attain the sophisticated lifestyle he had always dreamt of. Fate, it seems, plays a role in the lives of both Tamara and Nasser, leading them back into each other's lives. At this point Nasser has completely moved on from their relationship, even marrying Tamara's husband's sister. Now as brother and sister-in-law, Nassar and Tamara live together under one roof, a nightmare for Tamara having rejected him earlier. Eventually, the money corrupts Nasser's morals, leading him to commit a series of murders which results in the death of his own mother. The series ends with Nasser turning himself into the police and confessing to his crimes. The closing scene of the entire series shows Nasser being sentenced to death.

The company was founded in 1865 by industrialist Adolf T√∂rngren, who fell under financial difficulties during construction work. The ownership was transferred to Tampere Linen and Iron Industry, which had to complete the investments totalling over one million Finnish marks. The company built an over 90 metres long dry dock and a number of workshops. The dock was used for repairs and newbuilding projects, and the workshops produced various machinery parts and consumer products. Until the turn of 1880s Helsingfors Skeppsdocka had not reached a satisfactory level of profitability, and the parent company decided to sell it despite of significant loss. The new owner, Oskar Eklund, started an investment programme constructing new workshops and enlarging the premises. The company enlarged its portfolio to railway wagons. Despite of a fairly good order intake, Helsingfors Skeppsdocka fell into bankruptcy in 1894 due to difficulties in funding arrangements. A year after a new company, Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works was established to continue operations in the premises.  Background  The Helsinki seafaring started to develop after the centre was moved to its current location in 1640. In 1670 a dockyard was established in South Harbour to serve the recently founded Viapori fortress. Until the early 19th century, Finnish merchant ships were built by number of small yards, Ostrobothnia being the predominant shipbuilding area. By time Turku took over the role as the leading Finnish shipbuilding centre.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Laivatelakan synty ja ensimm√§iset toimintavuodet. pp. 7‚Äì27. While Helsinki had become capital of Finland in 1812, its significance as seafaring and shipbuilding centre remained low, until railway lines to H√§meenlinna and Saint Petersburg were built.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Foreword. pp. 5‚Äì6.  Foundation  Industrialist Adolf T√∂rngren left an application for starting a shipyard and engineering works in Helsinki magistrate on 2 August 1864. At the same time he applied for the premises an area in Hietalahti which consisted 12,200 m¬≤ land and 9,500 m¬≤ water. After an assent of the city elders, the magistrate decided on 14 September to lease the area to T√∂rngren for a 500 silver marks' annual sum. The application was subsequently assented by the Uusimaa Province governor and Senate Manufacturing Board, after which the Finnish Senate Finance Committee granted the permission on 4 March 1865.  Construction  = Plans and leadership = T√∂rngren selected engineer Lieutenant Fridolin Stjernvall to make plans for the yard layout. Stjernvall visited in Stockholm and Oskarshamn in Sweden and in Holten in Norway to gather knowledge. Stjernvall's plans were approved by the magistrate on 10 June 1865. The construction project was led by engineer Theodor Tallqvist, who made some changes to Stjernvall's plans. = Funding crisis = The construction project was halted in 1866 because T√∂rngren got run out of cash; by then the costs had reached to 200,000 marks. T√∂rngren made an arrangement, after which the company ownership was transferred to Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus (\\"Tampere Linen and Iron Industry\\"), to which he owed 435,000 marks. The work was continued under the same leadership after the transaction. The board of Tampere Linen and Iron Industry presumably planned selling the yard soon after the construction work was to be finished, but the size of the additional investment cost was vastly underestimated; until April 1867 the construction work had required another 194,000 marks from the company and a government loan of 100,000 marks, and by the end of the year, when the yard was finally operative, the parent company and its owners had credited the shipyard by further 355,000 marks. Tampere Linen and Iron Industry tried to sell the company to the Imperial Russian government, but the offer was rejected. Next plan was creating a shipbuilding company with one million marks' capital and selling the majority of shares to Russian owners, but the potential buyers wanted to start production of rolling stock, for which the yard's premises were not suitable. = Workshops = In 1866 he parent company appointed Swedish engineer Hermann Kaufmann to technical manager of the engineering works. The first tools, which were three metal lathes, tapping machine, two planing machines, press and circular saw for metal, were brought from Tampere and the workshop was taken into use in 1867. After the second part of the construction was completed in the same year, the premises consisted separate carpentry shop and planing mill. A foundry was built alongside the engineering shop. Russian monitor Rusalka docked in Hietalahti in 1868. = Dry dock = The dry dock was 91.5 metres long, 16.3 metres wide and 5.5 metres deep from water level. The pump machinery consisted of a main pump and additional centrifugal pump; they were operated by a single-cylinder 85‚àí90-ihp steam engine and a Cornwall boiler, or two traction engines, which were used as backup power source. Leakage water was pumped out by Worthington pump. The wooden gate was designed in a similar way as the Swedish Oskarshamn dock gate and made by Ostrobothnian carpenters who had fled from their homes due to the prevailing famine. The gate launching ceremony took place on 13 November 1867 at 2‚àí4 pm; the yard was decorated by flags and a large crowd witnessed the event. When the gate was lowered, it pushed away a large mass of water, and the gate foundation failed plunging the nearest bystanders into water; however, all of them were rescued to rowing boats. After the reinstalling the gate and inspection by authorities, the dock was ready to use. Another milestone was reached when the first docking took place in April 1868, again during presence of crowd. The vessel was steamship Constantin operated by Syd- Finska Kust√•ngfartygbolaget. In addition, a cradle with possibly with just few hundred tonne of capacity was built in 1867; another one was built in 1869. The number of construction workers was 300. The official launching ceremony of the shipyard took place in December 1868. The estimated headcount at the initial stage was between 50 and 100.  First operating years  The scale of business was too small to be able to cover the investment, which by June 1868 had reached 898,000 marks. Sales and number of employees remained low at the early 1870s; in 1870 Helsingfors Skeppsdocka reached sales of 82,700 marks and employed 31 people; in 1871 the sales were 124,000 marks with headcount of 76 people. The latter sum includes 53,000 marks for extension of steamship Lloyd, which has been a demanding project.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Toiminta Tampereen Pellava- ja Rauta-Teollisuus Osakeyhti√∂n hallinnan alaisena. pp. 28‚Äì37. Kaufmann left the company at the end of 1871 and he was followed by skilled and innovative engineer C. G. Hult. He initiated and led construction of a modern engineering workshop, which was buil in 1873‚Äì1875. The building consisted forging shop, engineering shop, carpentry shop, foundries for iron and brass, and offices for drafting and management. The machinery was powered by a 44-ihp steam engine and boiler, both built in the company's own workshops. Later the output turned out to be insufficient, which was solved by auxiliary power units. The cost of the investment was 100,000 marks, after which the total investment on the yard exceeded 1,000,000 marks. Shipbuilding was in upswing in the 1870s and Helsingfors Skeppsdocka built total 16 steam launches and tugboats with iron hull and a number of wooden barges, rescue boats and other vessels. The engineering shop produced centrifugal pumps, power hammers, safes, steam winches, steam engines, steam boilers and large variety of smaller tools and consumer goods. In 1876 the company presented its products together with the parent company in art and industrial fair held in Kaivopuisto. Hult left the company and emigrated to Sweden in 1878. Engineer Oswald Bonsdorff, a skilled shipbuilder, was appointed to company manager and the new technical manager was A. F. Fogelqvist, who had good theoretical knowledge.  Losses and new ownership  Despite of the favourable economical situation, the profitability was far from satisfactory level. By 1877 Helsingfors Skeppsdocka owed 1,240,000 marks to Tampere Linen and Iron Industry. The company faced difficult times during the following two years; a significant cause was 54,000 marks' loss from four tug steamers delivered to the Russian Admiralty. By now the owner had come to conclusion, that the company will not reach a such profitability that it could repay the investment, and started to consider ways to get rid of the shipbuilder despite of the losses. According to an alternative plan, the dock and engineering works were to be separated to two different companies, and the dock was to be sold to cover the losses. In a general meeting held on 5 November 1978, the board suggested selling the dock, pump station and gate to a new company for 700,000 marks; the planned initial capital for the new dock company would be 800,000 marks. The proposal was approved, but not put into practice. In the meantime, the owner negotiated with three prospective purchasers for the business: a Saint-Petersburg-base British trading house, an unnamed domestic person and an agent. The dock and the associated machinery had a book value of 440,000 marks, but due to low usage, it had brought just 6,200 marks' average annual gross income during 1870‚Äì1879, which was not enough to cover even the costs. The engineering works was the only profitable part of the company; during 1870‚Äì1876 it brought an average annual profit of 40,000 marks; however, this was not enough to repay the investment, as the value of the engineering works was set to 286,000 marks without inventory. An analysis presented in an extraordinary general meeting on 11 September 1879 suggested that the engineering works including the inventory could be sold for 483,000 marks, whereas the dock shall be regarded valueless. The board did not share the view that the dock worths nothing. The following general meeting took place one week after, and Tampere Linen and Iron Industry decided to set the value of Helsingfors Skeppsdocka to total 700,000 marks, of which the dock was 150,000 marks. The shipbuilding company was planned to take over liabilities of 300,000 marks and the owning company got 4,000 shares, each worth of 100 marks; some of the shares were planned to be transferred to the company owners. The plan was cancelled, because the state did not allow transferring the liabilities to Helsingfors Skeppsdocka. The balance for year 1879 showed 71,000 marks' loss, which further increased the desire to sell the company. Finally, in April 1880, Helsingfors Skeppsdocka was sold to engineer Oskar Eklund for 425,000 marks, of which 200,000 marks consisted of liabilities. The owner's decision to sell the business was encouraged by loss of 47,000 marks created during the four operating months of 1880.  Enlargement  After taking over the company, Eklund started to improve on the premises; many buildings were wooden and inappropriately planned, because the previous owner had not wanted to invest more on the plant than necessary. The state gave him a 100,000-marks' loan to fund the improvements; in addition to this, Eklund had to carry the 200,000 marks' liabilities which were transferred to him when buying the yard. Eklund had operated another yard in Helsinki before and he was an experienced shipbuilder. In 1880 the yard was connected to electrical grid, which improved productivity. The yard area was restructured in 1884; the first new building was a sheet metal workshop, an investment that cost 150,000 marks. A new office building, designed by Eklund together with architect Theodor H√∂ijer, was constructed in 1886. The ground floor was made from brick and the wooden upper included the manager's residence. In 1889 the yard constructed a new boiler building, which was equipped with an old boiler of S/S Hoppet. The main cradle was modernised an its capacity was increased possibly up to 500 tonnes or even more. In 1889 the company extended to rolling stock, when Eklund made a contract for delivering railway wagons. The new line of production required investments on facilities, and a new workshop and a railway line were constructed. Eklund rented more land from the city, and by 1894 the area covered 16,705 m¬≤.Osakeyhti√∂ Hietalahden...: Laivatelakka uuden hallinnon aikana. pp. 38‚Äì47. The business run well during the 1880s. In 1882 Eklund the company got a new chief engineer, J. W. Forsberg, under whose leadership the company built a number of steamships, steamboats and lightvessels. The value of production reached 496,000 marks in 1884. At the time, especially the sales of the company foundry was at high level. In 1888 the sales in docking reached to 167,801 marks and by the end of the decade the headcount was 125. During 1880‚Äì1888 the average annual sales were 329,000 marks and net profit 60,000 marks.  Bankruptcy  Despite the good sales, the company suffered continuously from lack of capital. Situation turned worse in the early 1890s, when Helsingfors Skeppsdocka fell into trouble due to difficulties in loan arrangements. Due to shortage of cash, operation were halted for a large part of year 1894 and the headcount was reduced to 89 people. The main Creditor, Union Bank of Finland, set two representatives to manage the company. The company was declared to bankruptcy on 17 December 1894.  Re-establishment  After the bankruptcy, the operations were continued under management of trustees of the bankruptcy estate. The estate was auctioned on 3 October 1895 to merchant J. C. Burmeister who continued the operations with his business partners. The new company was called Aktiebolaget Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstad (\\"Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works Ltd\\"). The articles of association were confirmed by the Senate already on 25 October.

In addition to the Bombastic Meatbats, he is a member of the instrumental groups Cosmosquad and Der Elefant as well as L.A. blues rockers Bleeding Harp, and has performed and recorded with artists such as Paul Gilbert, Sebastian Bach, Uncle Kracker, Chuck Berry, Ted Nugent, Tony MacAlpine, Jeff Kollman, and Tiles. Chown currently resides in the Los Angeles area where he works as an in-demand session player, writer, producer and sometime television actor in addition to his band commitments. He was one of the cast members of Season 8 of Swedish reality show Allt f√∂r Sverige. Biography Chown was born and raised in rural Escanaba, Michigan,Kevin Chown voter registration and grew up in a very musical environment. His father was a high school band teacher and his mother gave private piano lessons. He originally started out on drums but soon switched to bass guitar after hearing John Paul Jones and Led Zeppelin and began performing professionally at age 15 with a popular local band called Tyrant. Detroit years After a year at Bay College, Chown moved to Detroit to attend Wayne State University where he earned a bachelor's degree in jazz studies and was honored as ‚ÄúCollege Jazz Soloist of the Year‚Äù in 1993 at the Montreux Detroit Jazz Festival. At the same time, Chown also pursued his love of rock'n'roll and played with several bands around Detroit. While attending the NAMM Show in Anaheim, CA in 1991, Chown crossed paths with guitarist Jeff Kollman and soon joined his Toledo, OH-based progressive metal band, Edwin Dare. The group quickly garnered a strong following throughout parts of the Midwest and released 3 studio albums in the 1990s which were particularly well received in Japan. Chown would also release an all-instrumental solo album, Freudian Slip, in 1996. While playing with Edwin Dare, Chown also developed a reputation as a producer and session musician working out of his own Detroit-based studio. Among others, he became heavily involved with local progressive rock band Tiles, producing and playing on three of their albums, Tiles (1994), Fence the Clear (1997) and Presents of Mind (1998). He also wrote and produced songs and jingles for the Detroit Red Wings, the Detroit Tigers, Little Caesars Pizza and The Weather Channel, among others. In 1997, Chown briefly worked with Detroit rock icon Ted Nugent after being introduced by local rock singer Steve Black, Nugent's radio co-host. He would perform live in-studio with Nugent on his radio program on a couple of occasions. In the mid 1990s, Chown was featured in Guitar Player magazine's ‚ÄòSpotlight' column which led to a working relationship with GP columnist Mike Varney, also the head of Shrapnel Records. Chown became the bass player for newly formed multi-national progressive metal group Artension, recording 2 studio albums, Into the Eye of the Storm (1996) and Phoenix Rising (1997) for Shrapnel. He left the group in 1998 but would participate in the recording of two more albums, Sacred Pathways (2002) and New Discovery (2003). He also recorded albums with guitar virtuosos Tony MacAlpine (Violent Machine, 1996), Jeff Kollman (Into The Unknown, 1996), and George Bellas (Turn of the Millenium, 1997), and contributed bass to two releases by progressive metal band Magnitude 9. Move to Los Angeles Chown moved to Los Angeles in 1997 and quickly became a much in-demand session player, re-teaming with his old Edwin Dare cohort Jeff Kollman on various projects, producing acclaimed drummer Mike Terrana's 1999 solo album, Shadow of the Past, guesting on vocalist John West's Earth Maker (2002), and playing on a long list of soundtracks for TV and film. In addition, he picked up work as an actor, always playing a musician, and had various recurring on-screen acting performances, including on the television series \\"How I Met Your Mother\\". Chown also landed the coveted bass gig with platinum selling artist Uncle Kracker and toured the country in support of No Stranger to Shame, culminating in a double header home town gig in Escanaba in late 2003. In 2005, Chown became the bassist and co-musical director for Ivan Kane's Royal Jelly, a burlesque show with a residency at Hollywood's Forty Deuce club; the troupe made a national TV appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in October 2006 performing the Aerosmith classic \\"Walk This Way\\". Chown and fellow Royal Jelly musicians, Jeff Kollman and Charlie Waymire, also recorded an album of original music under the name JKB. Bleeding the Soul was issued in 2004 and accompanied by a promotional video for the song \\"By Myself\\", shot at club Forty Deuce. In the summer of 2008, Chown joined rock'n'roll icon Chuck Berry for his appearance at the Long Beach Blues Festival. Chown was also brought into the Chad Smith's Bombastic Meatbats fold, a 1970s fusion/funk oriented quartet led by Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, and featuring keyboardist Ed Roth and Chown's long-time musical companion, Jeff Kollman, on guitar. The band made their live debut at the 2008 NAMM Show, followed by a short tour of Japan, and released their debut album, Meet the Meatbats, the following year. The group toured Japan twice more, with Matt Sorum and Kenny Aronoff filling in for Smith, and have since issued two more albums, More Meat (2010) and Live Meat And Potatoes (2012). The group appeared at the Guitar Center Drum-Off at L.A.'s Club Nokia in early January 2014 where they were joined by guitar legend Steve Lukather. In 2011, Chown got the call to join former Nightwish vocalist Tarja Turunen on her world tour in support of her album What Lies Beneath, which included shows all across Europe and South America. The latter was documented via the Act I: Live in Rosario DVD (2012); Chown also appears on Tarja's three most recent studio recordings, Colours In The Dark (2013), which debuted Top 10 in half a dozen European countries, The Brightest Void (2016), and The Shadow Self (2016). The latter two also feature Chown's Bombastic Meatbats bandmate, Chad Smith, on select songs. Chown appears in the \\"No Bitter End\\" promotional video and took part in the band's extensive Far East and European tours, highlighted by an appearance at Germany's prestigious Wacken Open Air festival on August 5 in front of some 80,000 fans. In March 2015, former Skid Row vocalist Sebastian Bach announced the addition of Chown to his touring band. He made his live debut with Bach during a 10-date tour around the Southwest; a full-fledged US tour followed in the summer of 2015. He was also approached by guitarist Paul Gilbert and invited to help record his latest Kevin Shirley produced album, I Can Destroy, released in late 2015 in Japan and worldwide in 2016. In late 2016, Chown, along with fellow Tarja band members Alex Scholpp and Timm Schreiner, released a 3-song EP under the name Der Elefant, accompanied by a video for the song \\"Elefante\\". In December 2016, Chown was announced as the new bassist and official band member of progressive metal/fusion trio, Cosmosquad, featuring guitarist Jeff Kollman and drummer Shane Gaalaas. Chown is featured on the group's latest studio album, The Morbid Tango, released in early 2017. Chown and Kollman were also part of the Bleeding Harp line-up that recorded the 2018 release, Truth, which features a guest vocal appearance by Doug Pinnick of King's X fame on a cover of The Allman Brothers Band classic \\"Whipping Post\\". In November 2018, Chown announced the digital-only re-release of his 2 solo efforts, Freudian Slip (1996) and Light the Way (2013), titled Kevin Chown. In addition, the re- mastered 2-for-1 package also includes 3 previously unreleased bonus tracks, \\"Detroit Shuffle\\", featuring guitarist Jeff Kollman, \\"Paris\\", and \\"Move the People\\". Chown is also featured on Tarja's 2018 multi-format release Act II, available on DVD, Blu-ray, CD and vinyl. On September 1, 2019, Chown announced that he would be leaving Tarja after a 9-year stint with the band and join former Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach for a fall U.S. tour and that he had begun working with singer/songwriter Trevor Ohlsen in his hometown of Escanaba, MI. Bout with epilepsy Chown, who had been battling epilepsy since he was a teenager, underwent brain surgery at USC Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA on May 2, 2013, after suffering several seizures over the previous months. A special set up GoFundMe.com page raised thousands of dollars in contributions from friends and fans to help offset Chown's considerable out- of-pocket expenses from his medical procedures. He issued the Light The Way EP, which was released digitally on May 8 and was accompanied by a promotional video for the song ‚ÄúWe Light the Way‚Äù. Vocalist Angel Travis, guitarist Jeff Kollman, drummer Jono Brown, and backing vocalist Marian Tomas Griffin all lent a helping hand. Guitarist Jeffery Marshall, drummer Adam Gust and Chown's former Tiles bandmate Chris Herin also contributed on the EP. Another video for the song \\"Alive\\" was released only weeks later. Allt f√∂r Sverige reality TV appearance In May 2018, Chown was announced as one of the cast members of Season 8 of the Emmy award-winning Swedish reality show, Allt f√∂r Sverige, marketed in the U.S. as The Great Swedish Adventure. The show's 8 episodes aired weekly from September 16 through November 4 on Sweden's national public TV broadcaster, SVT. Chown's feature episode dealing his Swedish family heritage and their 19th century emigration to North America aired on October 21; Chown was among the final four contestants to appear in the November 4 season finale.

It was passed with 215 Republican votes against 205 votes of disapproval. The repealed privacy protections, once approved in 2016, sought to regulate what companies can do with data of customers' browsing habits, communication contents, app usage history, location data and social security numbers and safeguard customer data against hackers and thieves. Supporters of the vote argued that the privacy regulations stifle innovation by forcing Internet providers to abide by unreasonably strict guidelines. Due to the repeal Internet service providers (ISP) like Comcast, AT&T; and Verizon may sell Web browsing histories and other sensitive data directly to marketers, financial firms and other companies without consumers' consent. Furthermore, the FCC will be forbidden from issuing similar rules in the future. Background Internet providers have historically generated their revenue from selling access to the Internet and are now looking to increase their revenue by tapping the data their customers generate as they make use of the Internet. The industry with its profit motive favors an interpretation of privacy that does not consider browsing history or app usage data to be sensitive and protected ‚Äî the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) interpretation. However the FTC is unable to enforce its own guidelines without new authority from Congress. On 16 March 2017 CTIA claims that \\"Web browsing and app usage history are not 'sensitive information'\\" in a filing with the FCC. History * On 27 October the FCC imposed new privacy rules that were scheduled to take effect by the end of 2017 that would have required ISPs to get opt-in consent from consumers before sharing Web browsing data and other private information with advertisers and other third parties The FCC final rules were titled \\"Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunication Services,\\" 81 Fed. Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016). * On 15 February 2017 Senator Jeff Flake confirmed that he plans to introduce a resolution that would roll back the FCC's broadband privacy rules via the Congressional Review Act. * On 7 March 2017 Senator Jeff Flake and 23 Republican co-sponsors introduced the resolution. * From 21 March to the resolution's passage more than 15,000 calls against the measure were made into the Capitol. * On 22 March 2017 advocacy groups including Free Press, Demand Progress, and the ACLU went to Congress to deliver nearly 90.000 petitions to \\"save broadband privacy\\". * On 23 March 2017 the United States Senate passes the resolution with the votes of 50 Republicans against 48. * On 28 March 2017 the United States House of Representatives passes resolution \\"S.J.Res 34\\"https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2017202 * On 28 March 2017 the White House releases a statement according to which the administration strongly supports House passage of S.J.Res. 34 and the President's advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law. Reception Many of the privacy advocates who oppose ISP data sharing also oppose tracking by ad networks and technology companies such as Google but find ISP tracking extra worrisome as ISPs have access to all of one's browsing data ‚àí not just data from specific sites that share their data with particular ad networks, and as disabling cookies or adblockers can't prevent this sort of tracking. Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy states that the vote means that \\"Americans will never be safe online from having their most personal details stealthily scrutinized and sold to the highest bidder\\". Senator Brian Schatz states that \\"if this [resolution] is passed, neither the FCC nor the FTC will have clear authority when it comes to how Internet service providers protect consumers' data privacy and security. Regardless of politics, allowing ISPs to operate in a rule-free zone without any government oversight is reckless\\". According to Anna Eshoo the consequences of the resolution's passage are clear: \\"broadband providers like AT&T;, Comcast, and others will be able to sell your personal information to the highest bidder without your permission\\". Michael Copps, a former member of the Federal Communications Commission, called the bill a \\"perversion of what the internet was supposed to be\\". Dallas Harris, an attorney who specializes in broadband privacy and a policy fellow at consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge notes that ISPs might be able to figure out where you bank, your political views, and your sexual orientation based on what sites you visit and asserts that \\"the level of information that they can figure out is beyond what even most customers expect\\". Various information can be extracted from Internet traffic ‚àí for instance \\"the fact that you're looking at a website can reveal when you're home, when you're not home\\" and according to her \\"you don't need to see the contents of every communication to develop efficient ad tracking mechanisms\\". Senator Ed Markey states that \\"President Trump may be outraged by fake violations of his own privacy, but every American should be alarmed by the very real violation of privacy that will result [from] the Republican roll-back of broadband privacy protections\\". Cable lobby group NCTA says that they \\"appreciate today's Senate action to repeal unwarranted FCC rules that deny consumers consistent privacy protection online and violate competitive neutrality\\". Michael Capuano asks \\"What the heck are you thinking? What is in your mind? Why would you want to give out any of our personal information to a faceless corporation for the sole purpose of them selling it?\\". Evan Greer, campaign director of digital rights group Fight for the Future states that \\"today Congress proved once again that they care more about the wishes of the corporations that fund their campaigns than they do about the safety and security of their constituents\\". She also states that: Craig Aaron, Free Press Action Fund President and CEO writes in a statement: SearchInternetHistory.com is a crowdfunding campaign trying to raise $1 million to buy the browsing history of Republican officeholders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and then Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and FCC Chair Ajit Pai. Management Consumers may switch to ISPs with better privacy protections. However this could be difficult for some as many Americans only have a choice of one or two broadband companies in their area according to federal statistics. Senator Ron Wyden states that thus their only choice may be between \\"giving up their browsing history for an Internet provider to sell to the highest bidder or having no Internet at all\\". Furthermore, the existence of such ISPs is not guaranteed and Jeremy Gillula, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes that it's \\"unclear if they would even have to tell you they were doing it\\". VPN can be used to protect one's data from ISPs or theoretically to subscribe to foreign ISPs with better privacy protections. However good VPNs generally cost money, take some effort and minor technical skills to set up, and will slightly degrade the connection speed. Furthermore, the Tor browser can be used to surf anonymously. This would however significantly slow down connection speed and not be adequate in most cases. Also ISPs can't look into the encrypted traffic of sites that use TLS whose URLs starts with \\"HTTPS\\" but only the domain name. The HTTPS Everywhere browser extension allows for better protection via HTTPS. Also apps that use end-to-end encryption can be used to protect communication contents. Some consumers might assume that they can protect their browsing histories by deleting them or by using privacy modes of browsers such as Chrome's \\"incognito mode\\" which is not the case.

It lived in the Early Jurassic of Yunnan Province, China, and is represented by a single species, S. anlongbaoensis, known from a partial skull. Like the theropods Dilophosaurus and Sinosaurus, Shuangbaisaurus bore a pair of thin, midline crests on its skull. Unusually, these crests extended backwards over the level of the eyes, which, along with the unusual orientation of the jugal bone, led the describers to name it as a new genus. However, Shuangbaisaurus also possesses a groove between its premaxilla and maxilla, a characteristic which has been used to characterize Sinosaurus as a genus. Among the two morphotypes present within the genus Sinosaurus, Shuangbaisaurus more closely resembles the morphotype that is variably treated as a distinct species, S. sinensis, in its relatively tall skull. Description Shuangbaisaurus had a relatively robust (compared to Sinosaurus) skull, with a length of and a length/height ratio of 2.84, not including the thin paired crests that were present at least above the eye sockets. These crests are incompletely preserved, but appeared to have been formed mostly from the frontal bone, as well as possibly the postorbital and prefrontal bones. The crests may have extended further forward, over the nasal and lacrimal bones. Similar crests are seen in Dilophosaurus and Sinosaurus; however, the crests of Sinosaurus do not extend over the eyes, thus differentiating it from Shuangbaisaurus. At the tip of the jaw, the premaxilla and maxilla are separated by a groove, which is also a defining characteristic of Sinosaurus. The premaxilla would have been taller than it is long, which is similar to specimen LFGT LDM-L10 of Sinosaurus triassicus but unlike either Dilophosaurus or specimen KMV 8701 of Sinosaurus sinensis. Also like LFGT LDM-L10, the bottom edge of the premaxilla is much higher than the maxilla. The two bones are at the same level in KMV 8701, and are angled away from each other in Dilophosaurus. Similar to both LFGT LDM-L10 and KMV 8701, the maxilla bears a near-vertical front margin; it is lower and more pointed in Dilophosaurus. The front portion of the bottom margin of the maxilla is angled such that the first maxillary tooth projects forwards. There is a groove running parallel to the tooth row along the bottom rim of the maxilla. From behind, the maxilla is connected to the jugal. The lacrimal is located above their joint, enclosing the fossa that surrounds the antorbital fenestra. There is a ridge directed downwards and backwards on the side of the jugal, like in Zupaysaurus; this same ridge is horizontal in Sinosaurus and Dilophosaurus. The same is also true of the joint between the jugal and quadratojugal. The quadratojugal tapers to a point underneath the infratemporal fenestra, where it is joined at the back to the quadrate. Further above, the lacrimal is joined by the long and slender descending branch of the three-pronged postorbital, which is convex in its upper third. From above, the forward-directed branch of the postorbital is offset from the backward-directed branch, being separated by a small recess. The frontals appeared to have been long and large, forming most of the top of the skull. The antorbital fenestra of Shuangbaisaurus is large, occupying roughly one third the length of the skull. The back margin of the fenestra slopes backwards, like LFGT LDM-L10 and Dilophosaurus but unlike KMV 8701. Further behind, the orbit is keyhole-shaped, with a longer back rim compared to the front rim. The infratemporal fenestra is roughly trapezoidal, with a long axis oriented upwards and backwards towards the top of the rear of the skull. On the top surface of the skull, the rounded supratemporal fenestra is unusually small, with a diameter equivalent to only about half of the length on the top of the skull behind the level of the orbit. Discovery and naming Shuangbaisaurus is known from a single specimen, a partial skull missing most of the top of the snout, stored at the Chuxiong Prefectural Museum in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China under the specimen number CPM C2140ZA245. Additionally, the front half and back portion of the jaw are also associated with the skull. The specimen's snout has also become bent to the left due to deformation during fossilization. It was discovered in layers of purple muddy siltstone located in Liuna Village, Anlongbao Town, Shuangbai County, Chuxiong Yi, about south of the well-known Lufeng deposits. These layers have been recognized as belonging to the Early Jurassic Fengjiahe Formation, which has been tentatively dated to the Hettangian. In 2017, the type and only species of the genus Shuangbaisaurus, S. anlongbaoensis, was formally described and named by Wang Guo-Fu, You Hai-Lu, Pan Shi-Gang, and Wang Tao. The generic name refers to Shuangbai County, and the specific name refers to Anlongbao Town (with Anlongbao literally meaning \\"dragon-placing fort\\"), and thus both elements of the binomial name reference its provenance. In a 2019 conference abstract, Philip Currie and colleagues suggested that CPM C2140ZA245 fell within the range of variation of specimens assigned to Sinosaurus triassicus. Classification After Dilophosaurus and Sinosaurus, Shuangbaisaurus is the third large theropod known definitely to have had paired crests on its skull (though the smaller Coelophysis kayentakatae also has similar crests). Shuangbaisaurus seems to generally be similar to the roughly contemporaneous Sinosaurus. However, they are notably differentiated in that the crests clearly extend over the orbit in Shuangbaisaurus, whereas they are restricted to extensions of the nasal and lacrimal that do not reach past the orbit in Sinosaurus. Similarly, the backward and downward orientation of the jugal is a trait of Shuangbaisaurus not seen in Sinosaurus, where it is horizontal. However, the vertical groove separating the premaxilla and maxilla, which seems to be present in Shuangbaisaurus, was denoted as a distinguishing characteristic of Sinosaurus by Matthew Carrano and colleagues in 2012, thus complicating its referral to a new genus by Wang et al. A further issue in the relation between Shuangbaisaurus and Sinosaurus involves the taxonomic convolution that has befallen Sinosaurus. At least one species is recognized in the genus, Sinosaurus triassicus, consisting of specimens LFGT LDM-L10 and LFGT ZLJT01; another specimen, KMV 8701, originally named \\"Dilophosaurus\\" sinensis, has been referred to either S. triassicus or a second species S. sinensis. KMV 8701 approaches Shuangbaisaurus more closely in its tall skull and premaxilla than specimens referred to S. triassicus. Wang et al. elected to retain S. sinensis as a separate species owing to these differences. No phylogenetic analysis has been conducted to quantitatively determine the relationships of Shuangbaisaurus. Paleoecology Aside from Shuangbaisaurus, several sauropodomorph dinosaurs originate from the Fengjiahe Formation. These include Chinshakiangosaurus chunghoensis (a possible sauropod), Lufengosaurus sp., Yimenosaurus youngi, and Yunnanosaurus huangi (a juvenile specimen, which was also discovered in Shuangbai County). Ostracods of the genus Darwinula have also been found. A diverse ichnofauna is also known from deposits of the Fengjiahe Formation, including the ichnotaxa Eubrontes platypus, Grallator limnosus, Paracoelurosaurichnus monax, Schizograllator xiaohebaensis, Youngichnus xiyangensis, and Zhengichnus jinningensis (with the last four sometimes considered synonymous with Grallator). Temporally, the Fengjiahe Formation is equivalent to the Lower Lufeng Formation, from where Sinosaurus is known alongside a diverse assemblage consisting of another theropod, Lukousaurus; sauropodmorphs (including Chinshakiangosaurus sp., Lufengosaurus huenei, L. magnus, Xingxiulong chengi and Yunnanosaurus huangi); ornithischians; crocodylomorphs; cynodonts and mammals; turtles; amphibians; and bivalves.

This species stands out from other earthworms due to the presence of three pairs of sucker-like discs on the underside of the clitellum. An examination of A. chlorotica specimens from many parts of the British Isles suggests that there are two forms of this species, one with green pigment in the body wall, and one which lacks this pigment, making it pink.  Anatomy  Allolobophora chlorotica is a medium-sized earthworm, adults measuring approximately 50 mm in length. This species is unique in that it has three pairs of sucker-like discs on alternate segments on the underside of its clitellum.  Taxonomy  Allolobophora chlorotica is now thought comprise more than one species. Genetic research carried out by Cardiff University suggests the figure could be as high as four. Certain research lead by Central Lancashire University has shown that the pink and green morphs are very likely to be separate species. These different color morphs are thought to have different habitat niches, green morphs needing very wet conditions while the pink morph favors slightly drier conditions. = Genetics = Recent breeding experiments have put into question the status of the green and pink color morphs of Allolobophora Chlorotica, and whether or not they should be classified as two different species. Pairs were set up for 10 days to facilitate mating, separated, and then maintained in isolation for 28 days to obtain individual reproduction results. Cocoon production and viability were first determined from intra-morphic (p√óp and g√óg) and inter-morphic (p√óg) pairings. All pairings bred true, but when the inter-morphic pairs reproduced, the viability of both was significantly lower, but cocoons produced by the green worm were considerably lower. Experiments have revealed that the green color generally cannot be seen in Allolobophora chlorotica that are under 2 cm in length and 4 to 6 months old. In some cases, this change in color takes places after the earthworm is sexually mature and develops a clitellum, taking up to a year for it to turn green.  Distribution and habitat  Allolobophora chlorotica is native to the Palearctic, which consists of Europe, Asia north of the foothills of the Himalayas, North Africa, and the northern and central parts of the Arabian Peninsula. It has also now been introduced in North and South America, Africa and New Zealand. It can be found in a wide range of habitats, from arable land to woodland, to even front lawns. In a British study, this species was recorded in all habitats except pine woodland and mires. They are also often the numerically dominant earthworm species in England, especially in neutral to base-rich grasslands and arable soils. Because Allolobophora chlorotica is an endogeic worm, it builds complex lateral burrow systems through all layers of the upper mineral soil. This species of worm rarely comes to the surface, instead it spends its life in these burrow systems where they feed on mineral soil and decayed organic matter. Populations of the entirely pink morphs can be found in gardens and woodlands. The green morphs can be found in grasslands, ditches, banks of streams and lakes and among the roots of aquatic plants such as reed mace. In northern England, mixed populations of both pink and green morphs have been found in grasslands. = Conservation = Unfortunately, the abundance and distribution of earthworm species is poorly known in Europe. In the UK, there is an OPAL national survey of the 13 most common UK species (including A. chlorotica) and research being carried out by NHM staff with volunteers funded by Natural England that will provide more information once it is released.  Ecology  Allolobophora chlorotica is considered an endogeic worm, which means that they are topsoil or subsoil-dwelling worms that feed on soil, burrow and cast within soil, and create horizontal burrows in the upper 10‚Äì30 cm of soil. A 1959 survey of 17 sites in northern England supporting Allolobophora chlorotica populations seemed to indicate a possible relationship between soil moisture levels and the distribution of the pink and green morphs. It was found that sites which had a soil moisture content greater than 40% supported populations which were made up of more than 90% green morphs. A suggestion was made that it may not be simply the soil moisture content that affects distribution of the colour morphs but that it might be availability of the soil water to the earthworms that is important.

The hypothesis that the remote history of a variable has less influence than its values in the recent past, was stated in modern continuum mechanics as the fading memory principle by Bernard Coleman and Walter Noll.

The green economy can be defined as an economy, \\"that results in improved human well- being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities.\\" Aspects of a green economy would include stable growth in income and employment that is driven by private and public investment into policies and actions that reduce carbon emissions, pollution and prevent the loss of biodiversity. Wind turbines in Nova Scotia. Green economy policies can be defined as legislation or actions put forth by public institutions with the main intent of furthering establishing an environmentally sustainable system. Some of these policies would include investments into green energy sectors aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and aiding the growth of renewable energy resources.Loiseau, E., Saikku, L., Antikainen, R., Droste, N., Hansjurgens, B., Pitkanen, K., Leskinen, P., Kuikman, P. (2016). Green Economy and Related Concepts. Journal of Cleaner Production, 139, 361-371. Green economy policies can also be considered on an international scale, with agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. Policies on a national level include, agreements such as the Western Climate Initiative, and the Boreal Forest Agreement among many others. More recently, green economy policies have become popular across various public jurisdictions in Canada. There has been an implementation of policies and initiatives across various levels of government. Due to the rise in frequency of these green economy policies in Canada, the socio-technical landscapenhhh is changing. More Canadians are supportive of green energy policies and a transition into a green economy.Webb, C., Esakin, T. C. (April 2011) A Green Economy for Canada: Consulting with Canadians. Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy. Retrieved from: http://cielap.org/pdf/CIELAP_GreenEconomy.pdf. Varieties of green economy policies in Canada = Federal policies =  Spending  For the federal government, there are several policy instruments that are available. Spending has been a key instrument in attempting to mitigate the effects of climate change so far.Chalifour, N. J. (2016). Canadian climate federalism: Parliament's ample constitutional authority to legislate GHG emissions through regulations, a national cap and trade program, or a national carbon tax. National Journal of Constitutional Law, 36(2), 346. Government investment and support in regards to green technology will only further the process of decarbonisation in Canada. The federal government also collaborates frequently with the provinces in regards to how to move forward pursuing green technologies. The federal government also controls the Low Carbon Economy Fund, the money which could be used as leverage and under conditional circumstances to promote climate action from the provinces.Chalifour, N. J. (2016), 347. In the federal budget of 2016 tabled by the federal government, the budget proposed providing $1 billion over 4 years to support clean technology. This included the forestry, fisheries, mining, energy and agriculture sectors. Budget 2016 also provided $2.9 billion over 5 years to address climate change and air pollution issues aimed at reducing emissions and help meeting international obligations. In total, nearly $1.6 billion will be spent on a clean growth economy from 2016-2018 by the federal government.  Carbon pricing  Recently the federal government has established a minimum carbon price floor for provinces that do not currently have a pricing program.Chalifour, N. J. (2016). Canadian climate federalism: Parliament's ample constitutional authority to legislate GHG emissions through regulations, a national cap and trade program, or a national carbon tax. National Journal of Constitutional Law, 36(2), 347. According to the federal government, they are leaving it up to the provinces to implement a carbon pricing scheme. Below are government stated goals for the new carbon pricing strategy: * Provinces and territories will have flexibility in deciding how they implement carbon pricing: they can put a direct price on carbon pollution or they can adopt a cap-and-trade system. * Pricing will be based on greenhouse gas emissions and applied to a common and broad set of sources to ensure effectiveness. * The price on carbon pollution should start at a minimum of $10 per tonne in 2018 and rise by $10 a year to reach $50 per tonne in 2022. * The Government of Canada will provide a pricing system for provinces and territories that do not adopt one of the two systems by 2018. * Revenues from carbon pricing will remain with provinces and territories of origin. Carbon pricing has been a relatively new campaign pursued by the Government of Canada. The previous administration had not enacted a carbon scheme and the current government expects all jurisdictions across Canada to be compliant by 2018.  International agreements  Trudeau at the Paris Climate agreement Conference. Recently the government of Canada signed a climate deal called the Paris Agreement. Under the agreement countries set their own limits on greenhouse gas reductions with the overall goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. While these targets are not legally binding, Canada specifically pledged to lower its emissions by 30% from 2005-2030. This agreement was ratified by 195 nations in total at the summit. This agreement was meant to replace the Kyoto protocol, which Canada withdrew from in 2011. The targets will also be reviewed every 5 years to make sure nations are compliant in accordance with the agreement. Canada also has many bilateral agreements with various nations regarding green economy policies, including environmental cooperation agreements, along with a deep cooperation with the United States. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the United Nations organization that led to the development and ratification of the Paris agreement. = Provincial Policies =  Ontario  To comply with the Canadian federal policy, Ontario has chosen to implement a cap and trade system. The new system took effect January 1, 2017. The system contains two key components, cap, and trade. The cap restricts the amount of greenhouse gas pollution businesses and institutions can release into the environment. The cap shrinks year to year to encourage lower emissions. Companies must have permits or credits to cover their emissions if they exceed the cap. This is where the trade part of the policy comes into effect. Companies can trade credits or permits. This allows for high polluters to buy credits or permits from low emission companies to cover their emissions. The revenue generated from the cap and trade must be invested in a transparent way to comply with the law. Places companies can invest are green technology, lower carbon fuels and buying extra credits. According to the Ontario government, it will cost Ontario homeowners an extra $13 a month. There will be three types of participants in the cap and trade. The first is voluntary participants who opt in to participate in the policy. The second is mandatory participants who by law are forced to participate. The third is market participants who participate in the allowance market but aren't forced to comply with other regulations of cap and trade.  British Columbia  British Columbia was the first province in Canada to implement a green economy policy. On July 1, 2008 the province implemented a revenue-neutral carbon tax. The objectives of the tax are * encourage individuals, businesses, industry, and others to use less fossil fuel and reduce their - greenhouse gas emissions * send a consistent price signal * ensure those who produce emissions pay for them * make clean energy alternatives more attractive.  Alberta The Alberta government has opted to implement a carbon levy and rebates policy to combat climate change. The policy took effect January 1, 2017 and increases in 2018. The prices at which the Alberta government has priced carbon is $20 per tonne in 2017 and then $30/ per tonne after the increase takes effect in 2018. Not all carbon will be taxed, the price is based on the amount of carbon pollution released by the fuel when it is combusted, not on the mass of fuel itself. These include transportation and heating fuels such as diesel, gasoline, natural gas, and propane. Certain fuels, such as marked gas and diesel used on farms, will be exempt from the levy. All revenue will be invested back into the province of Alberta.  Newfoundland and Labrador  Newfoundland and Labrador have implemented the Management of Greenhouse Gas Act (bill 34) to comply with federal climate change legislation. It took effect on March 7, 2017. A fund has been created for supporting emissions- reduction technology, which will be 100% industry-funded. The goals of the management of greenhouse gas act are: * The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is introducing the new Management of Greenhouse Gas Act to reduce industrial emissions. * Emissions will be monitored for two years to help set reduction targets in consultation with industry. * The act also establishes a new fund for clean technology which will be 100% industry funded. * Local large industry accounts for 43% of greenhouse gas emissions and more than 30% of GDP.  Quebec  Quebec was an early adopter when it comes to economic climate change policy. In 2013 the Quebec government implemented 2013-2020 climate change action plan making them one of the first provinces to implement green economic climate change policy. The policy called for $2.7 billion to be invested towards the government‚Äôs climate change goals. The revenues are self- funded from the carbon market. The plan allocates $200 million to support businesses to reduce GHG emissions by investing in projects related to energy efficiency, process optimization and the installation of more eco-performing equipment. The provincial government implemented the cap and trade system for businesses in the industrial and electricity sectors that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2. The goal of the policy is to reduce GHG emissions in the highest emitting sectors by promoting energy efficiency as well as the use of energy from renewable sources.  Comparative Green Economy Policies  = Federal level = There are a variety of countries that a part of the OECD that are transitioning their economies towards one that is green and sustainable. Depending on the type of economy one‚Äôs country has, various policies are quite different. Germany has adopted a transition policy currently known as Energiewende. It is an ambitious industrial and societal transformation towards a low carbon energy system based on developing renewable energy. This has predominantly been done by convincing outside investors to invest heavily into the renewable sector, by having a feed-in tariff law. This is an example of a Coordinated Market Economy working with investors to spur green growth. There are three main parts to the feed in tariff-law: (1) A purchase obligation for the local grid obligator; (2) guaranteed minimum prices; and (3) a nationwide cost settlement system to balance out regional disparities The energy market was liberalized in the late 1990s in Germany, but it still remains a productive but heavily regulated monopoly. This feed-in tariff law has also notoriously been a safe investment for outside investors, which makes investing in green technology in Germany a safe bet. The feed in-tariff has also kept electricity prices steady, as a tweak in the feed-in tariff law accounts for the volatility associated with power generated from wind and solar sources. It is also estimated that in Germany nearly half of the country's energy capacity was run by cooperatives or owned by citizens through private installations. This type of policy has been in stark contrast to Canadian green economy policy. Typically green economy policies in Canada have been aimed at investing directly into industries and companies aimed at growing the green economy. Prices in Canada for electricity have also been notably volatile. USA‚Äôs policies have also been very similar to Canadian ones. In the 2010 budget, only about $21 billion focused on approaches that would reduce emissions in public transportation. Much of this money is in the form of grants and loans for green energy technology and tax breaks for various companies. However just $5.5 billion was allocated to grants and loans for emissions reducing technologies for the private sector. Most other green economy policies in the United States have been aimed at tax breaks or special tax provisions, which incentivizes certain energy related activities. Most of the American policy is comparable to what is seen in Canada. The Canadian budget has been allocated to investing public money into green technology initiatives while focusing on creating a sustainable economy for jobs. This could potentially be related to the similar types of economies that Canada and the United States share, as Peter Hall and David Soskice see them as Liberal Market Economies. Meanwhile, Germany which has pursued different types of successful policies can be considered a Coordinated Market Economy. = Provincial level = When comparing green economy policy across provinces it is clear to see that policy diffusion has taken place. Quebec and Ontario have both opted for a cap and trade system over a carbon tax that the western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta have chosen. Policies have diffused from British Columbia to Alberta and from Quebec to Ontario. The differences between the two regions of Canada can be linked to historical differences where preferences on energy policy have often differed like the National Energy Program. From the policy diffusion you can see evidence of learning theory taking place. Ontario and Alberta have clearly demonstrated this concept and have taken the successful policies that have worked in their respective regions of Canada and applied them to their provinces. Provinces will continue to improve upon their current policies and grow their green economies using policy diffusion and learning theory. Provinces will compare policies and implement policies that work for them and achieve both economic and green objectives.

During World War II Scholtz worked as a horticulturist and conservator of the greenery in ≈ªelazowa Wola and when the war ended she returned to her position at SGGW as an adjunct professor. In 1945, she and Gutt designed the Warsaw Insurgents Cemetery at the request of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz. Their design called for a wide central avenue rimmed by rows of trees, which had a chapel-mausoleum at one end and a decorative arrangement of the graves. The two also worked on the Palmiry Cemetery memorial. In 1946 she became a member of the Association of Polish Architects () and two years later was one of the founding members of the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA). When Krzywda-Polkowski died in 1949, Scholtz began working in the landscaping workshop of the (), which would later become the Warsaw Urban Planning Office. The group was involved maintaining green spaces in Warsaw, planning and designing new recreational areas to emphasize and enhance the natural landscape, and providing residence with improved living conditions by providing interior garden spaces. One of the first projects Scholtz worked on for the office was the landscaping along the . Between 1948 and 1949, she worked to reconstruct the Saxon Garden with Gutt. Beginning in 1958, Scholtz worked on projects for a joint initiative between the and the \\"Investproject\\" Cooperative to design landscaping for the housing projects designed Halina Skibniewska. In 1959, Scholtz designed a project in conjunction with the Warsaw Urban Planning Office, called the \\"People's Park\\" which included three parks in the Vistula River Gorge of Lesser Poland. The parks included a northern park, in Marymont; a park between Skaryszewski Park, formerly known as Paderewski Park, in the Praga Po≈Çudnie district of Warsaw and the Warsaw Zoo; and a central park located between the Ujazd√≥w Castle and the building complex (pl) which housed the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland. Only a small part of this project was ever completed, which was originally called the Powi≈õle Central Park of Culture and Recreation, and is now known as the . Scholtz co-designed with Zbigniew Karpi≈Ñski and Jerzy Kowarski the garden at the Polish Embassy in Beijing; a garden with Gutt and Tadeusz Zieli≈Ñski and Zbigniew Karpi≈Ñski at the Chinese Embassy in Warsaw; and a garden with Gutt, Wieslaw Nowak, and Zieli≈Ñski and Wies≈Çaw Nowak at the Polish Embassy in Pyongyang, North Korea. For many years, Scholtz served as the SARP delegate to the International Federation of Landscape Architects. From 1964, she was the coordinator of the Landscape Architecture Section of the Association of Polish Architects. The following year, she was selected by SARP to serve on the Verification and Artistic Commission. In July 1979, the association honored her with the status of \\"Creator\\", the year before her retirement. Death and legacy Scholtz died on 25 February 1996, in Warsaw. She is known as one of the founders of Polish landscape architecture.

Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. New Hampshire was won by the Democratic nominees, incumbent Democratic President Woodrow Wilson and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. They defeated Republican nominee, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes of New York, and his running mate Senator Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana. Wilson won New Hampshire by a very narrow margin of just 0.06283% (one vote in 1,592) and 56 popular votes. In terms of popular vote margin, this is the third-closest state presidential election race on record, behind two in Maryland from 1832 and 1904. In terms of percentage, it stands as the ninth-closest behind the two Maryland elections above, two from California in 1892 and 1912, Kentucky in 1896, Hawaii‚Äôs inaugural 1960 election, and the 2000 Florida and New Mexico elections.

It is the first feature film from writer-director Joe Aaron. Synopsis Synopsis by Lael Lowenstein: Echoes of \\"Harold & Maude\\"; resonate throughout \\"Crazy Jones\\"; a gentle comedy in which friendship between mismatched outsiders provides a gratifying outlet for both. Aaron plays Finnegan Jones, a suicidal grave-tender suffering from Tourette's syndrome, living with his overprotective mother (Elizabeth Ince) and preparing to turn 40. Convinced he'll need a caretaker after she's gone, Jones' mother sets about seeking a prospective spouse. Her candidate‚Äîa bubbly, corpulent neighbor (Tess Borden) whose insensitivity to Finnegan's condition only aggravates the malady‚Äîcouldn't be worse. Instead, he's begun to bond with a quirky, precocious 12-year-old named Syd (Francesca Catalano), whose refusal to pass judgment allows Finnegan to find his own voice. The friendship never advances beyond the purely platonic, though Catalano's Syd is a remarkably assured and fitting counterpart to Aaron's Finnegan.Reviewed at Santa Barbara Film Festival, March 2, 2002.

It is the largest venue in the Tianjin Cultural Centre. Designed by German GMP architectural company, the theatre adopts the style of modernist architecture. The construction of the Tianjin Grand Theatre started in 2009, completed and put into use on April 22, 2012. Its total construction space amounts to 105,000 m¬≤. The theatre can seat 3,600 people, and costs 1.533 billion RMB in total. Operas, dances, musicals, symphonies, Chinese modern dramas, and Chinese operas are all performed in the Tianjin Grand Theatre. The number of various performances staged in a year reaches 300.  History  = Tianjin Grand Auditorium = The Tianjin Grand Theatre grew out of the Tianjin Grand Auditorium located in 24 You Yi Road, He Xi District, Tianjin. The Tianjin Grand Auditorium was the convention centre of the Tianjin Hotel architectural complex. Its construction started in 1959, and completed in 1961. Wang Yayuan from the Tianjin Industrial Architectural Design Institute, Ministry of Architecture and Construction, led the designing work for the auditorium. As the largest hotel complex and auditorium at that time, its construction space amounted to 32,700 m¬≤. Its architectural style emulated the Great Hall of the People. Managed by Tianjin municipal government, the major function of the auditorium was to receive guests, hold all sorts of governmental meetings and other performances. Since its completion, all previous meetings of CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee and Municipal People's Congress, Political Consultative conferences, and government hosted large-scale activities were held here. In 1976, the front building of Tianjin hotel was reinforced for better earthquake resistance. In 2000, the re-construction of the auditorium started. Tianjin Construction Engineering Group's holding subsidiary, the Sanjian company took charge of the construction work. In August, the medium-sized theatre was first re- constructed. On the 15th of December, its re-construction was completed and then started operating. On August 18, 2001, the grand theatre and vestibule of the small theatre began their re-construction. On March 30, 2002, the project was completed. The re-constructed auditorium was then named as ‚ÄòTianjin Grand Theatre‚Äô on the basis of the change of its function. Zhang Lichang, the then Communist Party Secretary of Tianjin wrote the tablet to commemorate. From 2002 to 2012, the Tianjin Grand Theatre and Tianjin Grand Auditorium were actually ‚Äòone organization with two names‚Äô. Different names would be used when different activities were held. For government conferences, meetings or official activities, ‚ÄòTianjin Grand Auditorium‚Äô would be adopted as the name. For commercial activities and performances, the name ‚ÄòTianjin Grand Theatre‚Äô would be used. = Tianjin Cultural Centre = Tianjin Grand Theatre and the Nightscape of Musical Fountain In March 2009, the Tianjin Municipal Government initiated a public bidding for the cultural centre's architectural design plan. For the grand theatre, four plans submitted by well-known architects such as Rem Koolhaas and Meinhard von Gerkan were selected into the second round. The design plan for the theatre raised an extensive discussion and interest in Tianjin. On May 25, 2009, Huang Xingguo, the then mayor of Tianjin, presided at the meeting of the Standing Committee of Tianjin Municipality and heard the report of different plans for the design of the cultural centre. The final design plan for the Tianjin Grand Theatre (including its venues) was then decided. The plan from Gerkan, Marg and Partners and East China Architectural Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd. won the bidding at last. From June 3 to 12, 2009, public opinions about the Design Plan for the Cultural Centre of Tianjin Municipality were solicited through the coverage of news medias and display in Tianjin Planning Exhibition Hall. In September, the construction of the new theatre began. Zhang Gaoli, the Communist Party Secretary of Tianjin at that time visited the construction site personally for many times and facilitated the scheduled completion. On May 4, 2011, Culture, Broadcasting, Film & TV administration of Tianjin Municipality, the responsible authority of the Tianjin Grand Theatre signed the contract of entrusted operation and management with Beijing Qu Dong Culture & Media Co., Ltd. The latter one took the responsibility of running and managing the theatre. Thereafter, the Tianjin Grand Theatre separated from the Auditorium (which was operated and managed by Tianjin Hotel Group). The government-directed model turned into market-based one. Earlier in 2012, the Tianjin Grand Theatre was completed and put into use before the meeting of the 10th Tianjin Municipality's People's Congress. On April 22, 2012, the pilot run started, and the first performance was successfully staged. On April 27, symphony was first staged in the concert hall. From April 29 to May 7, the inaugural performances and ceremony were held in the grand theatre. From May 1 to June 30, 2013, the first International Chamber Music Festival in Tianjin was hosted in the Tianjin Grand Theatre. 19 concerts including performances from the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, Gidon Kremer, Chamber Music team of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Emerson String Quartet, Chinese pianist Chen Sa, Erhu player Yu Hongmei, Guqin player Wu Na and more than one hundred artists were staged in the theatre. In addition, these artists went to the local community to help people better appreciate the beauty of chamber music. Since the opening of the theatre, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Mariinsky Orchestra, Japan's NHK Symphony Orchestra and other top-level art ensembles all performed here.  Architectural Features  The Indoor Setting of the Tianjin Grand Theatre The total construction space of the Tianjin Grand Theatre is 105,000 m¬≤. It costs ¬• 1.533 billion and can seat 3,600 people. There are five floors above the ground, three floors under the ground. The theatre is equipped with 3,600 seats. The Tianjin Grand Theatre is designed by Gerkan, Marg and Partners, which has frequently participated in the designing of other landmark architectures in Tianjin. At the same time, it also won the bidding of Tianjin West Railway Station and other landmark buildings. Tianjin Sanjian company took charge of the construction and was awarded the National Luban Prize for Construction project in 2013. The production team of Transformers: Age of Extinction also shot the film in the Tianjin Grand Theatre. = The Philosophical Feature of the Design = Architect Meinhard von Gerkan said that the Chinese philosophical concepts of ‚ÄòHeaven‚Äô and ‚ÄòEarth‚Äô were adopted in the design. The Tianjin Grand Theatre symbolizes the ‚ÄòHeaven‚Äô. The theatre is raised above a man-made lake. Its round shape refers to the concept of heaven. The Tianjin Natural History Museum symbolizes the ‚ÄòEarth‚Äô, which is realized through its pitched roof. As the theme building of the new Tianjin Cultural centre, the grand theatre's dish-shaped roof echoes with the museum's, symbolizing the concepts of ‚ÄòHeaven‚Äô and ‚ÄòEarth‚Äô together. A delightful contrast is thus formed in the new cultural centre. = Constructional Details = The grand theatre consists of four parts - the opera house, the concert hall, the experimental theatre and the multi- functional hall. Among them, the opera house is the largest. Located in the south side of the theatre, it can seat 1,600 people. Four entrances (A, B, C, D) of the opera house are set up from the ground to the third floor. Access for disabled visitors is also available. The concert hall with an island-shape stage is the second largest and can seat 1,200 people. Its design is inspired from the terrace in vineyards. It can hold a full-sized orchestra and a large choir. To the east of the opera house and concert hall are the experimental theatre and the multi-functional hall. Both are equipped with 400 adjustable seats. Besides, there is a 1,200-meter street full of stores selling works of art linking the four different parts inside the grand theatre.  Theatre Operation and Alliance  The Tianjin Grand Theatre's Concert Hall = Operation Model = The Tianjin Grand Theatre and the Tianjin Grand Auditorium were once ‚Äòone organization with two names‚Äô. Thus, as the largest convention centre of Tianjin, the grand theatre was completely operated by the municipal government in the past. When the new grand theatre was established in the cultural centre, the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China was also held in Beijing. The reformation of cultural system was proposed at the same time. In 2012, the Tianjin Grand Theatre shifted from the government led operational model to the entrusted one. The entire market-based operating model - BOT (Build - Operate - Transfer) was adopted. Beijing Propel Culture & Media Co., Ltd acquired the power for operation of the theatre and earned the support from the municipal government. Although the company did not get financial aids from the government, it enjoyed the policy of tax reduction. The annual operation cost approximates ¬• 100 million. Besides, the company got the permission to use the venue (5,000 m¬≤) under the theatre's 6-meter-high step to develop creative industry as a subsidy for the operational cost. According to the contract signed by the municipal government and the company, Propel Culture & Media Co., Ltd is supposed to accomplish 300 performances every year. Among them, 15% should be ‚ÄòA-level‚Äô performances. = Performances and Art Education = Concert of Charles Dutoit and Philadelphia Orchestra in Tianjin Every year, more than 300 performances are staged in the grand theatre, including operas, dances, musicals, symphonies, Chinese modern dramas, Chinese operas. Since the establishment of the theatre in April 2012, about 10 high-toned operas have been performed annually. For example, Puccini's Tosca, Tchaikovsky‚Äôs Eugene Onegin carried out by Stanislavski Russian Theatre, B√©la Bart√≥k‚Äôs Bluebeard's Castle, Giuseppe Verdi‚Äôs Rigoletto, Il trovatore, Aida performed by Hungarian State Opera House, Mozart‚Äôs The Marriage of Figaro by Deutsche Oper am Rhein, and La traviata of Giuseppe Verdi. In June 2012, Concert of Charles Dutoit and Philadelphia Orchestra was staged in the theatre. 296 performances have been staged and 270,000 visitors have been served till the first anniversary of the theatre‚Äôs inauguration ceremony. Besides these performances, the grand theatre also plays a vital part in art education. Activities such as academic forums, international chamber music festivals, and ‚Äòart education and community outreach‚Äô are frequently held in Tianjin. = Facilities = The grand theatre's audio- visual equipment is excellent. According to the comments of experts, the opera house is unanimously judged as the best in China, by no means inferior to the National Centre for the Performing Arts. In April 2012, the then artistic director and chief conductor of Zurich Chamber Orchestra Tang Muhai commented ‚Äòthe facilities of the Tianjin Grand Theatre are among the bests in the world‚Ä¶the sound effects are fabulous.‚Äô In April 2013, a cold wave swept across Tianjin and temperature dropped immediately. The municipal government's central heating system had already stopped its supply on March 15. Without the heating supply, the theatre's temperature could not reach 23‚ÑÉ (the minimum requirement for normal performances), which directly caused the suspension of Royal New Zealand Ballet‚Äôs performance. After this incident, the theatre submitted its proposal to the municipal government for the installation of its independent heating system. But this effort proved to be futile as the competent department asserted that the central heating system could satisfy the theatre's needs without any problem. = Theatre Alliance = The Tianjin theatre alliance was founded in September 2012 after the registration and approval by Tianjin Civil Affairs Bureau. It is a non-profit trade union consisting of main theatres (including the Tianjin Grand Theatre), artistic groups and performance marketing agencies in Tianjin. Beijing Qu Dong Culture & Media Co., Ltd acts as the deputy director of the union.  Periphery of the Theatre  = Transportation Facilities = Planning and design of Tianjin Cultural Center The Tianjin Grand Theatre adjoins You Yi Road, Le Yuan Avenue and many other high streets of the city. It is also next to the hub of communications of the cultural centre. Tianjin subway line 5 and line 6 join here. Line 10 and line Z1 also have stops near the theatre. Besides, the public transit system near the theatre is quite advanced. Line 912, 641, 675, 632, 868, 686, 668, 859, 857, 866, 4, 619, 47, 48, 800, 838, 826 and nearly 20 buses can send visitors straight to the cultural centre. Express buses also pass through this area. = Peripheral Scenery = The Tianjin Cultural Centre is also the centre of the administrative area of Tianjin Municipality and part of the Xiao Bai Lou financial district. Adjoining the CPC Tianjin Municipal Committee and the people's government of Tianjin Municipality, the Tianjin Grand Theatre is the main building in the cultural centre. There are Tianjin Library, Tianjin Art Gallery, Tianjin Museum, Tianjin Natural and History Museum, Tianjin Science and Technology Museum and other venues in its vicinity. Besides, there are other landmarks and scenic resorts around the theatre, such as the Meijiang Convention and Exhibition Center and the Five Great Avenues tourist area. There is a musical fountain opposite to the theatre. The spouts and water jets are accompanied with the classical music such as Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto and Con te partir√≤. It creates a theatrical spectacle with light, music and water at night.
