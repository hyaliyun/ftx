The bumps serve to create friction if it falls on its back and needs to roll over. The shell forms a barrier from the elements. The head only comes out twice a year to look around. Otherwise it travels blindly eating whatever nutrients happen to be in the soil below it. Unfortunately, for this blind hunting method they have failed to breed to high numbers. They exist only in Ireland in a small patch of grass in the northern region. An Irish Bar nearby is named, \\"Head down Snails.\\" After the famous snails that continue to mate and bump into each other aimlessly. Patrons of the bar seem to do the same.

Description The size of the subfusiform shell varies between 14 mm and 25 mm. The shell surface is chalky white, crossed by horizontal purple to black streaks on the seven rounded axial ribs, that are twisted and swollen at the base of the body whorl. There are also eight or nine spiral riblets. The low spire is globose and consists of two and a half whorls, sitting op top of four body whorls. As each subsequent whorls rises above the shoulder margin of the previous whorl, the sutures are not visible. The body whorl is large and almost spindle- shaped. The ovate aperture has a small anal canal that point slightly backwards. The outer lip is crenulate, but has a smooth inner surface. The columellar lip is callused. The siphonal canal is moderately long and, typical for this genus, fused above, almost sealed below and pointing to the left at its base. A.

Description The fusiform shell is of moderate size and its length varies between 16 mm and 40 mm. The color of the shell is somewhat white with spiral bands with a reddish-brown to bluish-black color on the leading edge of each varix. The shell has a rather short, subacute, conical spire. There are five convex whorls. The body whorl is broad and spindle-shaped. Each spire whorl contains six rounded varices that are broader at the body whorl, but thinner and curved back at the stubby, top whorls and around the siphonal canal. The sutures between the whorls are deep and crossed by the oblique varices. The porcelaneous white aperture has an oval shape and has a finely dentate outer lip. The siphonal canal is rather short, almost completely closed and curved to the left at the base. There is no apparent anal canal. The inner surface of the aperture has a rippled form, reflecting the form of the ribs at the outer surface. The columella is smooth.A. Myra Keen, Sea shells of Tropical West America, p. 529George E.

It is the only species in genus Azumamorula. Description The shell size varies between 15 mm and 20 mm Distribution This species is distributed in the Indian Ocean along Madagascar, the Mascarene basin, R√©union, and along Eastern Australia. Taxonomy This species was originally named Ricinula mutica by Lamarck in 1816, grouping it with species that are now mostly in Drupa and Morula. In 1823, Dall defined two new genera, Drupina and Morulina, to hold species of Drupa and Morula having simple non-plaited columnellae. He chose R. mutica as the type species for Morulina. Thiele in 1931 and Wenz in 1941 had placed Morulina into Drupa. In 1968, Emerson found that the teeth on the radula of D. mutica had an unusual shape. As a result, he desired to split it out to its own genus, but the name Morulina was already taken as a genus of arthropod. Thus he introduced a new name Azumamorula, recognising Masao Azuma who had extracted the radula specimen. In 2004, Houart placed Azumamorula and Oppomorus as subgenera of Morula, and moved Morula from subfamily Rapaninae to Ergalataxinae.Molluscabase lists Drivas & Jay (1987) as the basis for its record on M. (A.) mutica. MolluscaBase eds. (2020). MolluscaBase. Morula (Azumamorula) mutica (Lamarck, 1816). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at: http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=217139 on 2020-02-01 However, in 2013, a phylogenetic study of the sequences for four genes indicated that Morula (Morula) sensu stricto was polyphyletic, and Morula (Oppomorus) was a separate clade. The relevant genes from A. mutica haven't been sequenced, but it's unlikely to be part of a more-restricted Morula‚ÄìHabromorula group. As of 2020, Houart lists Azumamorula as a separate genus and Molluscabase classes the combination Azumamorula mutica as \\"accepted\\".MolluscaBase (2019). MolluscaBase.

Description The shell size varies between 18 mm and 30 mm. The conical, oblong shell is compact and contains no varices. It is covered with dark brown to black blunt knobs on a white background with spiral cords between the rows. The body whorl is covered with six rows of nodules. The outer lip is dentate with four to five teeth within. The narrow aperture is blackish. The columella and the inner lip are white. This globular shape, tight shell coiling, strong sculpture, a dentate outer lip and narrow aperture offers an added protection against shell-crushing predators, such as fishes and crabs. This mollusc is a predator and feeds by drilling sedentary or semi-mobile prey. It eats only other molluscs, mainly gastropods of the genera Cerithium, Rissoina, Heliacus, and Bittium, and the mussel Hormomya.

A subordinate command of I Corps, USARAK is the ground element of the Alaskan Command. USARAK is headquartered at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson and is commanded by a major general. Early Army involvement in Alaska A U.S. Army Alaska Stryker from Bravo Company, 3-21 Infantry Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team during Operation Arctic Pegasus at Deadhorse, Alaska, 3 November 2015. The U.S. Army's important history in the Great Land began at the very moment Alaska became American soil on 18 October 1867. Elements of the 9th Infantry were on hand as the Russian Golden Eagle was lowered and the Stars and Stripes were raised in Sitka, which then became headquarters for the Alaska Military District. Charged with maintaining law and order in the new territory, U.S. Army soldiers helped quell uprisings and built new forts at Wrangell, St. Paul Canal, Kodiak Island, and on the Kenai Peninsula. They also enforced regulations regarding the killing of fur seals, whose population had been severely depleted during the Russian reign. The Army relinquished control of Alaska to the U.S. Treasury Department in 1877, but did not entirely leave the territory. The Signal Corps operated weather stations, and a number of officers led small geographic explorations to learn more about the territory. These expeditions into various parts of Alaska continued through the turn of the 20th Century, as mapmaking and road and bridge building expanded the frontier. The Klondike Gold Rush in Yukon Territory, Canada, and later gold rushes in Alaska helped that expansion, as thousands of people poured into Alaska. Early 20th Century Although the Royal Canadian Mounted Police maintained law and order in the Yukon during the Gold Rush, the U.S. government, after sending Captain Patrick H. Ray and First Lieutenant Wilds P. Richardson to study the situation, did not deem it necessary to send the Army into Alaska as peacekeepers. As more and more people came into Alaska and northwestern Canada, the need for better communications with the lower 48 states became critical. The Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) connected all the forts in the territory with Seattle. By 1903, the line stretched from Seattle to southeastern Alaska, Valdez, the interior, and Nome. The project fell under the direction of Brigadier General Adolphus W. Greely. Lieutenant William \\"Billy\\" Mitchell, another officer who would later achieve military fame, also worked on the four-year project. While Greely and his men struggled to complete the WAMCATS project, Richardson, on his third tour of duty in Alaska, headed the Alaska Road Commission, building garrisons and trails in south- central Alaska. The Army in Alaska saw a decline in activity from 1908 to 1939, with a brief surge during World War I. Work continued building roads and bridges and improving trails during this period. Alaska during World War II Military construction in Alaska accelerated in 1940 as the world prepared for another great war. Ladd Field, near Fairbanks, was built as a cold-weather test station and Fort Richardson, named for Wilds P. Richardson, was built near Anchorage. Colonel Simon B. Buckner assumed command of the Alaska Defense Force in 1940, achieving the rank of major general during his following three- year tenure in what evolved into the Alaska Department. Through the Lend-Lease Program, the United States transferred nearly 8,000 aircraft to the Soviet Union at Ladd Field, which later became Fort Wainwright. The aircraft were flown from Great Falls, Montana, to Ladd Field by American crews. Russian crews then flew the planes to Siberia and on to the Russian Front. The pilots leaving Great Falls followed a series of small airfields that became known as the Northwest Staging Route. One of those airfields, Big Delta Airfield, later became Fort Greely, providing ample acreage large scale training exercises, northern warfare training and extreme cold weather testing. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Army and Navy engineers began building airstrips in the Aleutian Islands to defend against possible Japanese attacks. U.S. Army units also built an initial pioneer road in 1942 for the Alaska-Canada (ALCAN) Highway in less than eight months. In 1943, civilian contractors followed and constructed a more permanent, all-weather highway. The 1,420-mile road was built as an overland supply route to get personnel and equipment to Alaska. The ALCAN Highway complimented military infrastructure that was built throughout Alaska than ensured Allied forces could defend the territory and carry the fight to the enemy, if necessary. Alaska was the only American soil on which ground fighting occurred during World War II; the Aleutian Islands Campaign began following the Japanese bombing of Dutch Harbor and seizure of Attu and Kiska islands in the Aleutian Chain in June 1942. The successful battle by the U.S. to retake Attu in May 1943 was proportionately one of the most costly amphibious assaults of World War II in the American and Pacific theaters in terms of American casualties suffered. The Japanese secretly evacuated Kiska in late-July 1943, several weeks prior to U.S. and Canadian forces seizing the island in mid-August 1943. At the end of the war, most Army installations throughout the state closed permanently or transferred to other agencies. Postwar emphasis turned to training. Post World War II: USARAL The Alaskan Command (ALCOM) was created in January 1947. As the first Unified Command under the Department of Defense, ALCOM was headquartered at Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage where it controlled all military forces in Alaska. The Alaskan Department changed its name again in 1947. The new name for the headquarters for all Army personnel in Alaska became U.S. Army Alaska, or USARAL. Military missions assigned to USARAL included ground and air defense of Alaska, with priority to the Anchorage and Fairbanks areas; development of cold-weather and mountain-warfare doctrines; conducting a cold- weather and mountain school at Fort Greely; providing logistical support to Air Force and Navy elements in Alaska; conducting National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve training; supervising Reserve Officer Training Corps activities; and, providing internal security, including plans for recovery from nuclear attack. By 1959, several Nike Hercules missile battalions were activated in the Anchorage and Fairbanks areas which operated under the last unit inactivated in 1979. The Army established the Yukon Command at Ladd Air Force Base as a component of the U.S. Army Alaska (USARAL) with the mission of point defense of U.S. military installations north of the Alaska Range. Consequently, infantry and anti-aircraft units comprised most of the Army presence at Ladd AFB during the 1950s. Elements of the 4th Regimental Combat Team arrived at Ladd AFB in 1950, and the 1st Battle Group, 9th \\"Manchu\\" Infantry Regiment took its place in 1956. At some time by December 1957, the 1st Battle Group, 9th \\"Manchu\\" Infantry was split between Ladd AFB and Eielson AFB, with the headquarters being at Eielson AFB and some of the line companies (C Company, for one) remaining at Ladd AFB. That configuration remained until at least December 1959. The 4th AAA Group was stationed at Ladd until 1958. In 1959, a NIKE battalion equipped with nuclear-capable Nike Hercules surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) took over the interior defense mission. Later two battalions of Nike missiles were stationed in Alaska: 4th Battalion (later 1st Battalion), 43rd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, and 2d Battalion, 562nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment. The two battalions and their direct support ordnance companies fell under the command of the USARAL Artillery Group, headquartered at Fort Richardson.U.S. Army Alaska, 'Nike Operations in Alaska,' Chapter 4 The Group was directly responsible to the USARAL Commanding General for Army participation in the air defense of Alaska, which involved Nike Hercules batteries, fighter interceptors, and the associated early warning radars and communications systems. In 1964 the USARAL Air Defense Artillery Group, composed of two Nike-Hercules missile battalions, was activated and moved its offices from Building 1 to building 656, Fort Richardson. The USARAL Air Defense Artillery Group was renamed the 87th Artillery Group (Air Defense) in January 1968.Woodman, Duty Station Northwest, Vol. 111, p. 154, cited at http://nikealaska.org/87th/87th.html 4/43 ADA defended Anchorage (which would have included the battery at Site Summit) while 2-562 ADA provided area defense around Fairbanks. 4/43 ADA was redesignated as the 1st Battalion, 43rd Air Defense Artillery in 1971. It was at that time that the 2/562 ADA was deactivated. In March 1971 the Department of the Army announced its decision to close the remaining Fairbanks area missile sites of the 2/562 Artillery, the 166th Ordnance, and the 87th Artillery Group by the end of June 1971. USARAL's combat units officially reorganized in July 1963, into the 172nd Infantry Brigade Mechanized) at Fort Richardson and the 171st Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) at Fort Wainwright. The two brigades were re-designated as Light Infantry Brigades in 1969. Home of the 6th Infantry Division USARAL was discontinued as a major subordinate command on 31 December 1972, and the 172nd Infantry Brigade (Alaska), headquartered at Fort Richardson, assumed command and control, reporting to U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort McPherson, Georgia. The 171st Infantry Brigade was inactivated in 1973 leaving the reorganized 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) as the principal combat formation, split-stationed at both Fort Richardson and Fort Wainwright The 6th Infantry Division (Light), headquartered at Fort Richardson, was activated in 1986, replacing 172nd Infantry Brigade (Separate). The 6th ID (L) Division headquarters moved to Fort Wainwright in 1990. The 6th 1D (L) maintained an Arctic focus in its unit training and was actively involved in training exercises in Japan and Thailand, at the Joint Readiness Training Center in Arkansas and Louisiana, and throughout Alaska until its inactivation in July 1994. At that time, Army forces in Alaska reorganized under the command of U.S. Army Alaska (USARAK), headquartered at Fort Richardson, with the 172nd Infantry Brigade as the principal combat formation, split-stationed at both Fort Richardson and Fort Wainwright. 1993 onwards: USARAK The command was activated after the Department of the Army's decision in March 1993 to inactivate the 6th Infantry Division (Light), which was then the principal Army unit in Alaska. = Current Structure = US Army Alaska order of battle Staff Sgt.

The type species is T. namsari, based on PIN 3386/1, a partial skull and skeleton discovered in the Aptian-age Lower Cretaceous H√ºhteeg Formation at H√ºren Dukh, central Mongolia. Two other species were named from this locality, with both later being reassigned: T. egloni, now Irenosaurus egloni; and T. magnus, now Ikechosaurus magnus. A fourth species, T. klauseni, was named from a partial skull and skeleton found in rocks of roughly the same age farther west in Mongolia.

Quinn (May 22, 1906 ‚Äì December 14, 1965), was an American manager and professional wrestling promoter in Canada and the United States. He grew up in Massachusetts and organized boxing and wrestling events in New England and such cities as St. Louis, Missouri, Chicago, Illinois, and Montreal, Quebec. Bringing gimmicks and showmanship back to professional wrestling in Montreal, he helped restimulate local interest in the sport. Quinn died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1965. Early years Quinn was born in Waltham, Massachusetts and got involved in boxing as a youth. He later took a job as a taxi driver in Brookline, Massachusetts. In the 1930s, Quinn began promoting professional wrestling shows in Massachusetts, where he had a business relationship with fellow wrestling promoter Paul Bowser. Montreal Quinn‚Äôs big break came on July 27, 1939, when the Montreal Athletic Commission granted him rights to promote wrestling events in the Montreal Forum. He chose to avoid the ‚Äúscientific wrestling‚Äù favored by Jack Ganson, the previous promoter at the Forum. Instead of what he called ‚Äúpink wrestling‚Äù, Quinn pushed gimmickry, storylines, and bloody brawls. Quinn‚Äôs shows began on August 8, 1939, with Yvon Robert as his central attraction. Other stars of his promotion included √âdouard Carpentier, Yukon Eric, and Killer Kowalski. At one point, Gorgeous George was brought in for a series of matches against Yvon Robert. Another famous match featured boxer Jersey Joe Walcott facing wrestler Buddy Rogers, which Rogers won in the third round. Other territories Over time, Quinn also expanded his territory, organizing events throughout Quebec and New England. In 1959, he began promoting wrestling events in Chicago. The following year, he stated that he controlled most of the wrestling events in Canada and Boston as well as substantial portions of Chicago and St. Louis. Having made professional wrestling more popular in Quebec than any sport aside from hockey, Quinn earned up to $250,000. He ran into trouble in 1961, when a boxing match between Archie Moore and Bob Cleroux failed to attract as many ticket purchases as hoped. Quinn decided to cancel the event and was stripped of his boxing and wrestling promoter‚Äôs licenses as a result. His wrestling license was reinstated several weeks later. Aside from the storylines in his promotions, Quinn also ensured success through television exposure and connections with influential people. He pointed to the massive increases in ticket sales that occurred after his featured wrestlers gained notoriety through televised shows in Chicago. He also held a television contract with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Quinn befriended Elmer Ferguson, a Montreal sportswriter, in a relationship that was advantageous to Quinn‚Äôs wrestling organization. He also promoted events for charity and donated money to powerful political figures. When decisions were made regarding professional wrestling, Quinn‚Äôs acquaintances sided with him. Quinn had a negative relationship with promoter Jack Pfefer, who Quinn described in a letter published in the New York Daily Mirror as ‚Äúthe Cancer of the Wrestling Business‚Äù. He also had a disagreement with Sam Muchnick in 1957 about control of Carpentier, who Quinn had begun managing. Quinn promised to involve the United States Department of Justice if the matter was not resolved quickly. In 1960, Quinn allowed Bob Langevin to become the public face of his promotion, while Quinn dealt more with the financial aspects.

The shell grows to a maximum length of about . This species is distributed in the northeastern Pacific Ocean from the Aleutian Islands to California. Description Apertural view of N. caniculata Nucella canaliculata has a robust shell with a strong spire, a short notch to house the siphon, and up to seven whorls. The whorls are demarcated from each other by deep grooves and are sculpted with many low spiral ridges of approximately even size. The surface of the shell is matt; small individuals are often orange while larger ones are grayish or pale brown. The margins of the aperture are often yellow, and the animal's soft parts are protected by a horny operculum. The maximum length of this species is about . This dog winkle can be distinguished from the frilled dog winkle (Nucella lamellosa) by the absence of frilled decoration, and from the northern striped dog winkle (Nucella ostrina) by the evenness of the size of the sculpted ridges. Distribution This dog winkle is native to the Pacific coasts of North America. Its range extends from the Aleutian Islands off Alaska to San Luis Obispo County, California, but it is uncommon to the north of Puget Sound or to the south of San Francisco Bay. It is found on both exposed and sheltered rocks in the intertidal zone and is particularly common in wave-exposed areas of the Olympic Peninsula and near mussel beds. Ecology N. canaliculata is a predator and feeds on mussels and barnacles by drilling a hole through the shell. Researchers found that the dog winkle was more successful at drilling into the barnacle Semibalanus cariosus when it drills between the lateral plates rather than through them. A toxin is then injected through the hole which causes the barnacle's muscles to relax and the opercular valves to gape, whereupon the dog winkle can easily consume the soft tissues.

This species occurs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, its range extending in the intertidal zone from the Aleutian Islands southward to central California. Description Nucella lamellosa is a large snail with a strong shell growing to a length of and width of . The shell has no more than seven whorls and has a horny operculum. The spire is well developed, with a short notch to accommodate the siphon. This snail is rather variable in colour, shape and surface texture. Some specimens are smooth, others rough and others have frilled lamellae (angular plates). Some of these features may be as a result of abrasion and wave action, and when present, the spiral sculpture takes the form of one or two ridges per whorl, the whorls being flattened near their joints making them appear to be angled. This snail can be white, grey, brown or orange, occasionally purplish, and is sometimes spirally banded. Distribution This whelk is found in shallow waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from the Bering Strait and the Aleutian Islands to central California. It is found intertidally on rocks from the mid to lower shore and is one of the commonest whelks in this habitat in the Pacific Northwest. Ecology This whelk is a predator, feeding largely on mussels and barnacles. The radula is used to scrape through the shell of the prey and the soft tissue is extracted. The whelk is itself eaten by crabs such as the red rock crab Cancer productus and the seastar Pisaster ochraceus. In the presence of the crabs, there is a tendency for the whelk's shell to grow thicker and be more robust, and thus less easy for the crab to crush. This may be as a result of chemicals released into the water by the crabs because the thickness of the whelk's shell seems unaffected by the presence of Carcinus maenas, a recently introduced invasive species of crab that also feeds on whelks. A different response in shell morphology was evinced in the presence of the seastar. Here, the shell tended to get longer with a high spire, enabling the whelk to retract its soft tissues as far as possible from the seastar. If both crabs and seastars were present, the shell phenotype that tended to evolve reflected the response to the predator that caused the greatest mortality. The whelks also show behavioural responses to both crabs and seastars by seeking refuge. Breeding takes place in hidden locations such as under rocks, with many whelks congregating to mate and lay eggs in capsules which resemble clusters of oats as they dangle from the substrate.

Other common names for this mollusk include emarginate dogwinkle, short-spired purple dogwinkle, striped dogwinkle, ribbed dogwinkle, emarginate whelk, ribbed rock whelk, rock thais, short-spired purple snail and rock whelk. Description This dogwinkle has a robust shell with three indistinct whorls. It can be in length, but a more typical length is or less; the aperture is less than half the diameter of the shell and can be closed by a brown, horny operculum. The exterior of the shell is spirally ridged, often with heavy ridges alternating with more delicate ones. The heavy ridges may bear coarse nodules, but in more exposed locations these, and the ridges themselves, may be partially smoothed. The ridges tend to be pale in color and the furrows between them dark, typically brown, gray, black, orange or yellow. The interior of the shell is purple. Distribution and habitat M. ostrina is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean. Its range extends down the western coast of North America from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, to Cayucos, California. It is found in the intertidal zone on rocky coasts, often in the vicinity of mussel beds, and particularly in wave-exposed positions. Ecology Like the other members of its family, this dogwinkle is a predator. Each individual has its own food preferences, but the population as a whole feeds predominantly on mussels and barnacles (Balanus glandula), but sometimes on periwinkles (Littorina sitkana and Littorina planaxis), or limpets (Collisella scabra). The bay mussel (Mytilus trossulus) is usually preferred as prey over the California mussel (Mytilus californianus). Having selected its prey, the dogwinkle drills into the shell with its radula, injects digestive enzymes which liquefy the tissues, and sucks out the contents. The dogwinkle is itself eaten by the purple sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the red rock crab (Cancer productus). It lays its eggs in clusters of stalked capsules, known as \\"sea oats\\", which are attached to rocks high up in the intertidal zone. Although there are around 550 eggs in each capsule, most of the eggs are infertile and are consumed by the developing juveniles, 10 to 20 of which hatch from the capsule after three or four months, without an intermediate larval stage.

It marked the third reunion for Silvia Navarro and Sergio Basa√±ez as protagonists.http://www.alma-latina.net/HerederaLa/HerederaLa.shtml The series was then developed into an American telenovela by the title of American Heiress.http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/american-heiress/286764 Plot Meet Maria Claudia(Silvia Navarro). Her father, Don Julian (Guillermo Murray), is the most influential industrialist of the Mexican political scope. Lauro(Victor Huggo Martin), her older brother, incarnates the ambition, greed and resentment, which he uses like arms on his way to the political and economic power. Lorena (Aylin Mujica), her sister, is a talented and beautiful woman and at the same time suffering from culpability and addiction. Octavio(Xavier Massimi), her younger brother, is the minor of the family. Don Julian is on the verge of dying and Maria Claudia (who studies in the USA), returns urgently to Mexico; but on her way she gets in an accident and doesn't arrive. In the middle of her misfortunes, she meets Antonio (Sergio Basa√±ez), an ex-soldier of the Gulf War, and they fall in love. Don Julian survives and the experience of being so close to death will unite more than ever the love of the father and his family. Maria Claudia and Antonio are meant for each other and try to build their happiness; but everything is destroyed with the appearance of Aranza, the woman who years back offered to Antonio something more than just a fleeting love.

Description The hyaline, white shell has a fusiformshape. Its length measures up to 25 mm but generally no more than 15 mm. The small protoconch is smooth and consists of little more than one whorl. The teleoconch contains 6-7 whorls bearing a very strong median keel and delicate, foliated varixes (6-9 on the body whorl) forming elongated projections at their intersection with the keel. There is no other spiral sculpture is present. The outer lip simple, with a peripheral projection terminating the keel. The siphonal canal is long and delicate, widely open. The taxonomy of deep-water forms related to this species is unsettled (see comments in Bouchet & War√©n, 1985); some of these correspond to the nominal species Pagodula cossmani (Locard, 1897) which differs in lacking long projections along the shoulder which is not so pronounced, and in having spiral cords below the shoulder in a pattern recalling Trophonopsis barvicensis (Johnston, 1825). Distribution This marine species occurs in the Eastern Atlantic, from the Bay of Biscay to Morocco; in the Mediterranean Sea, usually in 100‚Äì300 m depth. Gorringe seamount, moderately common in 330‚Äì830 m, but not found on the other Lusitanian seamounts. References * Kiener L.C. 1838‚Äì1879. Species general et iconographie des coquilles vivantes.

It was docked with the aft port of the Zvezda module of the station. Launch Progress M-04M was launched by a Soyuz-U carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch occurred at 03:45 UTC on 3 February 2010. Docking After just over three days of free flight, Progress M-04M docked with the Zvezda module of the International Space Station at 04:26 UTC on 5 February 2010. Its docking marked the first time four Russian spacecraft had been docked to the station at the same time; since the Soyuz TMA-16, Soyuz TMA-17 and Progress M-03M spacecraft were already docked. It is expected to remain docked until 10 May 2010, when it will depart, allowing Soyuz TMA-17 to be moved to the Zvezda aft port. This in turn will clear the way for the arrival of the Rassvet module, which will be delivered by on STS-132. Cargo The Progress M-04M spacecraft delivered of cargo to the ISS. This included water to be used by systems in the Russian segment of the station, propellant to refuel the station and to perform orbital manoeuvres, food and medical supplies. Undocking Progress M-04M seen shortly after undocking from the ISS. Progress M-04M undocked from the ISS on 10 May 2010. On 7 May 2010, Russian Space Agency's Mission Control announced that the ISS crew had loaded Progress M-04M with garbage and readied the spacecraft for undocking. The command for undocking was issued at 11:13 UTC, and three minutes later Progress M-04M separated from the Zvezda module. Cosmonauts Aleksandr Skvortsov and Mikhail Kornienko monitored the undocking with photo and video cameras focusing on the Progress docking mechanism to confirm that there were no missing or damaged O-ring seals on the docking interface. Deorbited The spacecraft stayed in an autonomous flight for 60 days after undocking and take part in the Reflection geophysical experiment to study reflective characteristics of the freighter's hull and the transparency of the Earth's atmosphere. Progress M-04M was deorbited on 1 July 2010 over the Pacific Ocean. The deorbit burn began at 13:54 UTC. At about 14:40, remaining parts of the spacecraft which had not burnt during the reentry, fell down in the south area of the Pacific Ocean, 37¬∞47‚Ä≤ South, and 235¬∞09‚Ä≤ West.

Description Peter Dance (1969) said that the shell of Pterynotus loebbeckei was \\"the loveliest, most exquisite natural object he has ever seen.\\" The shell is fairly uniform in color and is typically a pastel to bright orange, although white, pastel pink and yellow forms exist. There are 7 to 9 body whorls after the nuclear whorls, each whorl bearing three prominently protruding varices that are often referred to as wings, and six knobs evenly spaced so that there are two knobs between each varix. The shell has a scaley microsculpture and prominent spiral cords which give the shell a lacey appearance, and the prominent \\"wings\\" are wavy and smoother than the whorls.
