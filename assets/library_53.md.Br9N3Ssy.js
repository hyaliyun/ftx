It ran only four issues, with print publication dates of March to June 1994. The series was published by Dark Horse Comics. Publication history From 1991 to 1994, John Byrne developed his own creator-owned titles at Dark Horse Comics under the Legend imprint, as did other artists and writers such as Mike Mignola, Arthur Adams and Frank Miller. In addition to Danger Unlimited, Byrne created Babe (1994), John Byrne's 2112 (1991), and John Byrne's Next Men (1992‚Äì1994) while with Dark Horse. Danger Unlimited was intended as an ongoing series, but it ended abruptly after just four issues at Byrne's decision, due to less-than-anticipated sales brought on in part by the mid-1990s collapse of the American comic industry. Byrne himself provided insight into this collapse (or Wall Street-like \\"normalization\\") in the letter column to issue #4. Byrne had intended the series to capture a wider, younger audience with a lower cover price and no content that would require a \\"mature\\" warning. Low pre- sales and long lead times gave him less revenue, so he made the decision that it was unprofitable to continue work on the title. Byrne says he has been misquoted about his intention for the title. He never said it was \\"the Fantastic Four done right.\\" His self-described quote was, \\"Well, since nobody else is doing the Fantastic Four\\" ‚Äî that is, an old-fashioned, adventure-based superhero series suitable for all ages ‚Äî \\"I thought I would.\\" That the book was not a copy of the earlier title is bolstered by the fact that while the \\"original\\" Danger Unlimited team had similar attributes to the Fantastic Four, the later team had different powers and backgrounds. Each issue included an additional story featuring Torch of Liberty, an American superhero similar to Captain America. These stories were set during World War II in the European theater. Although no members of Danger Unlimited appeared, this had many connections within the same universe, including a cameo appearance by the Torch in one of the Danger Unlimited stories. The stories and characters were also created by Byrne. Plot The only story arc of the series is called ‚ÄúPhoenix Agenda‚Äù and is set in 2060. The 20th century backstory is interwoven throughout the four books out of sequence via flashbacks. In December 1959, the Carson family meets with famous explorer Mike Worley in South America to investigate an ancient, giant spaceship that had crashed in the Amazon jungle in the distant past. The ship's systems trap the four and expose them a mutagenic substance intended to give the ship's crew powers as warriors on whatever planet they visit. The substance would later be nicknamed, \\"Gunk.\\" They escape after brief exposure to the Gunk, but it gives each of them superpowers which they use to fight for good as the original Danger Unlimited. The members include Miss Mirage (Connie Carson), who can project illusions. Her brother Thermal (Calvin Carson) can fly and project heat and cold. Their father, Doc Danger (Dr. Robert Carson), is a brilliant scientist who had his intellect augmented even more, continuing his mutation over the years with an increasingly enlarged cranium and atrophied limbs until he became nothing more than an enormous head by 1985, supported by a flying platform with robotic manipulator arms. And Hunk (Worley), who gains rough, stone-like, superhard skin and superstrength. Connie was immediately attracted to Mike and they would eventually marry. In 1985, the team engages in a final battle with Umbra, their nemesis. During Umbra's attack on the team's headquarters, Thermal is seriously injured and Doc Danger places him into a biological stasis chamber before turning to battle Umbra alone. Nobody knows what happened after that, but Doc Danger shuts down all systems and seals the headquarters in a force field with a time lock set to disengage in 75 years. The team was missing and presumed dead. In 2060, the time lock releases the force field and the new Earth government moved in to demolish the headquarters. A sudden energy signature inside draws a military team to investigate. When they try to cut into the containment pod, Calvin's latent powers allow him to absorb the energy and burst free from the containment pod, after which he loses consciousness. A sample of Gunk was also stored inside the pod and explodes over Corporal Teresa LaFayette, a fan of Danger Unlimited. Both Calvin and Teresa are comatose for the next two weeks, Teresa as a giant, spiky, rocky humanoid. When they awake, Calvin has amnesia and no longer seems to have his powers after that first and only outburst. Teresa has reverted to human form. Professor Davis Palmenter, who was studying what happened to Teresa, realizes it was Gunk at work again and smashes the sample vial of it with his hand. He is split into three identical but independent clones who think in unison. Captain Brewster, Teresa's commanding officer and also a freedom sympathizer, explains to Calvin that an alien race called the Xlerii invaded Earth in 2010. All superhumans mysteriously vanished in 2011 during the ensuing Alien War. The ship that the Carsons investigated in 1959 was a Xlerii advance scout. After defeating the bulk of Earth's military forces, the Xlerii offered Earth a deal for peace and prosperity but in reality are taking over, altering the global environment to fit their needs. The Earth is now perpetually dark and shrouded by clouds, with almost constant rain. Discussion of the superhumans and their disappearance is forbidden under Xlerii rule. Brewster gives Calvin a mnemonic stimulator to help him recall memories of his past life with Danger Unlimited. As Teresa is introduced to Calvin, a Xlerii enforcer in battle armor attacks them in his hospital room. Teresa transforms and defeats the enforcer. The Xlerii try to excuse the attack as an automated response to Calvin's reappearance. They claim to have no role in the disappearance of Earth's superhumans and thus had never seen the need to remove them from their database as enemy combatants. Brewster is suspicious and arranges a police vehicle for Teresa and Calvin to leave the hospital. They're discovered and pursued but manage to escape. Teresa and Calvin flee to her supercentenarian great-great-grandmother's house in Louisiana. The three Palmenter clones arrive, sent by Captain Brewster, and convinces them to become a new Danger Unlimited, with additional encouragement from Teresa's ancestor, who remembers the time before the Xlerii arrived and there was still sunlight in the sky. Teresa takes on the name \\"Belabet,\\" based on her great-great-grandmother's Creole exclamation of \\"La belle et la bete\\" (Beauty and the Beast) upon seeing her transform. The Palmenters call themselves \\"Caucus.\\" They plan to pursue two main missions: to drive the Xlerii from Earth and to find out what happened to all of the superheroes. Calvin would continue to try to regain his memories and discover the fate of his Danger Unlimited teammates. Additional background Byrne eventually intended to reveal that the team's arch-enemy, Umbra, was actually Caroline Carson, the wife of Robert Carson (Doc Danger) who had perished in 1950 and been somehow resurrected and transformed afterward. This may explain why Doc Danger says as he readied himself to battle Umbra alone, \\"And, in the end, perhaps this was how it was always meant to be...\\" Umbra was never actually shown in any of the issues. A previously unpublished page on John Byrne's website ‚Äî finished, colored and lettered -- shows two unidentified characters sneaking through a top security Xlerii holding facility to find the corpse of Calvin Carson in a morgue-like drawer after finding out that Captain Brewster had previously inspected the drawer. Four promotional pages published as the series premiered showed a battle between the original team (presumably circa 1970, as Doc Danger was still recognizably human but his cranium had visibly expanded in both height and girth) and aliens (not Xlerii, which is why Calvin did not know of Xlerii) aboard one of their spaceships. Nazi supervillain Golgotha was a recurring adversary of the team, although he appeared only in one flashback. He appears to be a cyborg with a mechanical left arm and his head is a bare skull underneath a transparent dome. Golgotha was the arch- enemy of Torch of Liberty and Doc Danger mentions that he himself and Golgotha had come into conflict in 1944. He is mentioned in John Byrne's timeline of that universe as being fought and killed after World War II. He was resurrected in 1965, battled Danger Unlimited thereafter and later killed in battle by Calvin Carson after murdering Calvin's wife. Ultroid is another villain mentioned in the timeline but not revealed within the series.

Since the 1960s, when he met Cornelius Cardew and helped found the Scratch Orchestra, Parsons has been strongly associated with the English school of experimental music. He was born in Bolton and studied at St John's College, Oxford before taking up composition lessons under Peter Racine Fricker at the Royal College of Music in London in 1961. In the 1960s he met Cornelius Cardew; Parsons attended Cardew's experimental music classes at Morley College since 1968. In 1969 Cardew, Parsons and fellow composer Howard Skempton founded the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental free ensemble devoted to performing contemporary music. The Orchestra broke up in early 1970s, partly as a result of the politization led by Cardew. Parsons was among the Orchestra members who refused to be associated with the Maoist politics Cardew was propagating, and left. In 1970 Parsons started working as visiting lecturer in the Fine Art department of the Portsmouth Polytechnic and in the Slade School of Art, University College London. In 1974 he and Skempton formed a duo to perform their own works. In 1996‚Äì97 Parsons was a bi-fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge. During this time he organised concerts at Kettle's Yard, Cambridge. Since the early 1960s Parsons has also been active as a writer on music; his writings include a number of important articles on contemporary English composers. Parsons' music is influenced by Anton Webern, composers of the so-called New York school (John Cage, Morton Feldman and Christian Wolff), various English composers he met through Cardew and the Scratch Orchestra, and, since the Portsmouth years, \\"Systems\\" artists such as Malcolm Hughes and Jeffrey Steele.

A verse romance approximately 11,000 lines long, its main character is equivalent to Sir Griflet son of Do, a Knight of the Round Table known from other literature. Translations of Jaufre were popular on the Iberian peninsula; a version of the tale (from a Spanish redaction) even exists in Tagalog, the language of the Philippines. Synopsis Below is a summary based on the ms. A version, after Lavaud & Nelli's 1960 translation into modern French, and Ross G. Arthur's English translation. Chapter names approximately follow the latter. =Prologue: 1‚Äì55= After a short eulogy to the court of King Arthur, the poet dedicates his work to the young King of Aragon, who has recently defeated God's enemies, possibly the Saracens in Spain. =King Arthur's Court: 95‚Äì485= The poem proper begins. The court of King Arthur is assembled in the hall at (i.e. Carlisle) for the feast of Pentecost, but King Arthur declares that no one shall eat until an adventure has occurred. When no adventure appears, King Arthur goes into the Forest of Br√©c√©liande in search of it. He finds a maiden crying beside a mill, who pleads Arthur for help from a beast which raids the mill and eats all her wheat flour. Arthur enters to find a horned beast larger than any bull, with a shaggy red ( \\"sorrel\\") coat, a pugnosed snout, large eyes, and long teeth. When Arthur grabs the beast by the horns, his hands become stuck. The beast then carries him off, and dangles him over the edge of a cliff. The knights of the Round Table, at the base of the cliff, are alarmed, and one knight suggests firing an arrow at the beast. However, as this could also kill Arthur, it is decided that they should take a safer option: all the assembled knights strip bare and use their clothes to create a soft landing-mattress to cushion Arthur‚Äôs fall if the beast should drop him. The beast outwits the knights, and simply moves further along the cliff. The beast then springs from the cliff, metamorphosing into a knight, and both he and Arthur land safely. With the king's abduction exposed to be a jape, they all return to King Arthur's court at Cardeuil. =The Knight Jaufre: 486‚Äì713= A young man arrives at the court of King Arthur and begs the King to knight him and grant him his first wish. King Arthur agrees to do so. Then a knight named Taulat de Rougemont arrives at the court. He suddenly stabs one of Arthur‚Äôs knights in the stomach in front of Queen Guinevere, and leaves. The young man who had just arrived asks to follow this knight and avenge the offence committed, but Arthur's seneschal Kay mocks him, saying that this is a drunken boast. The young man insists that that is not the case, and begs King Arthur to let him follow Taulat. King Arthur initially refuses, but when the young knight reminds Arthur of his promise to grant him his first wish, Arthur agrees. King Arthur asks the young knight his name. He announces that he is Jaufre, son of Dovon. Jaufre departs on horseback, saying that he will not eat, drink, or sleep until he has caught Taulat de Rougemont. =Estout de Verfeuil: 714‚Äì1331= On his way, Jaufre comes across two knights who have been killed. He comes across a third knight who is injured but has not yet died of his wounds. The wounded knight claims to have been wounded by Estout de Verfeuil. Jaufre continues on his way, and finds a band of 40 men who say that they are Estout's prisoners. When Estout arrives, Jaufre fights him, and conquers. Estout begs for mercy, and Jaufre spares him, sending him and his 40 prisoners to the court of King Arthur. =The Knight of the White Lance and his Dwarf: 1332‚Äì1657= Jaufre continues on his voyage, and comes across a splendid white lance suspended from a beech tree. A dwarf is guarding the lance, and threatens to hang Jaufre if he touches it. The dwarf's master, the Knight of the White Lance, arrives, and threatens Jaufre with the same fate. Jaufre fights the knight, conquers, and hangs him in the same manner as he would have been hanged himself. The dwarf prays for mercy and Jaufre commands him to carry the white lance to the court of King Arthur. =The Sergeant: 1658‚Äì2180= Jaufre continues, but a sergeant on foot bars the way. He demands Jaufre to forfeit his horse and his armour before passing, which Jaufre refuses to do. The sergeant then throws three barbs at Jaufre, but they miss. So the sergeant jumps on Jaufre's horse and wrestles with him. Jaufre cuts off his arms and legs, then frees the 25 men the sergeant had held prisoner, and sends them all to the court of King Arthur. =The Lepers: 2181‚Äì3016= Jaufre encounters another man, who tells him to go no further: a dangerous leper is in the neighborhood, who has killed a knight and kidnapped the maiden (daughter of a Norman count) being escorted. Jaufre is offended by the informant for presuming he would cower at such news. Just then, an underling leper is seen carrying away an infant from his mother, and Jaufre goes off to rescue the child, following the leper into his master's house. Inside, Jaufre interrupts the master leper on the verge of raping the maiden. This villain is of gigantic stature and armed with a heavy mace. Jaufre vanquishes this foe, cutting a span of his sleeve, severing his arm, gashing his leg, and beheading him. But during combat, Jaufre suffers head injury from the dropping mace, and a final kick renders him unconscious. The maiden revives him by splashing water on his face, and Jaufre in his stupefied state mistakes the maiden for the enemy, strikes her a blow (with his fist) which would have proven lethal had it been his unsheathed sword in hand. Jaufre is unable to leave the lepers‚Äô house because it is enchanted, but extracts the secret of how to break the enchantment from the underling leper, whom he catches part way in the process of killing infants. Jaufre chops off the underling's hand (adding the taunt he will make the vulgar gesture no more), but spares his life, once he learns that the underling was acting under orders, collecting a full tub of the children's blood for the master to bathe in as purported cure. The house crumbles once it loses its enchantment, and Jaufrey declares he will resume his pursuit of Taulat, who killed a knight \\"right before Queen Guilalmier (Guinevere)\\", instructing the leper, the maiden, and the others he saved to seek King Arthur's court. =Castle Monbrun: 3017‚Äì4167= Jaufre, continuing on his way, enters the gardens of a castle called Monbrun. He is so tired he decides to sleep on the grass. This stops the birds in the garden from singing. The chatelaine, Brunissen, who is usually lulled to sleep by the birdsong, is furious, and sends her seneschal to investigate who the intruder is. The seneschal brusquely wakes Jaufre, so Jaufre attacks him and forces him to retreat. Jaufre goes back to sleep. The chatelaine sends out a second knight to summon Jaufre. Jaufre is woken again, attacks the second knight, and forces him to retreat, thinking that he and the seneschal are one and the same. The chatelaine then sends out a third knight. Jaufre is woken again, attacks him, and forces him to retreat, thinking that he, the second knight and the seneschal are one and the same. The chatelaine then sends out all of her knights, who seize Jaufre and carry him inside. Jaufre is immediately attracted to Brunissen's beauty, and Brunissen is also secretly attracted to Jaufre. She permits him to sleep in the great hall, as long as he is watched over by her knights. He throws himself onto the bed, fully armed. Brunissen is unable to sleep for thinking of Jaufre. The watchman gives a sign, and the knights all begin to lament. Jaufre asks the reason for this, at which all the knights start to beat him, but he is not harmed because he is still wearing his armour. After this, Jaufre is unable to sleep for thinking of Brunissen. On the stroke of midnight, the watchman again gives a sign and the knights begin to lament. Jaufre plans to escape. When the lamentations have stopped, he gets up, finds his horse, and leaves, still unaware of Brunissen‚Äôs secret love for him. When, at dawn, the watchman gives a sign to lament, Jaufre is discovered missing. Brunissen is furious that her men have let him escape. She rebukes her seneschal and sends him off to find Jaufre. =The Cowherd: 4168‚Äì4343= Jaufre, in the meantime, passes a cowherd from Monbrun, who has laid out a table with an array of sumptuous food. The cowherd asks Jaufre to join him, but Jaufre refuses. The cowherd insists, and Jaufre eventually accepts the invitation. Jaufre asks him the reason for the collective lamentations, and the cowherd reacts violently: he attacks Jaufre, slaughters his cows, and smashes his cart. Jaufre rides away, but remains disconcerted. =Augier d'Essart: 4344‚Äì4878= Jaufre is offered hospitality by the sons of a man called Augier d'Essart. When Jaufre asks the reason for the collective lamentations, the sons initially attack Jaufre. Then they beg Jaufre's pardon and renew their invitation of hospitality, which Jaufre accepts. Their father, Augier, welcomes Jaufre into his home. Augier had been an old friend of Jaufre's father Dovon. Jaufre is taken aback at the beauty of Augier's daughter. The following day, Augier asks Jaufre to stay longer, but Jaufre insists that he must depart. Accompanied by Augier and his sons for the start of his journey, Jaufre asks them again the reason behind the lamentation. Initially threatening him, Augier eventually tells Jaufre that he will find the answer if he goes to the neighbouring castle and presents himself to the eldest of the two ladies who are caring for an injured man. She will explain the reason and will tell Jaufre where he can find Taulat. =The Tortured Knight: 4879‚Äì5169= Jaufre passes an encampment before arriving at the neighbouring castle. Jaufre approaches the elder of the two women, who informs him of the reason behind the lamentations: once a month for seven years, Taulat has forced the injured man, who they care for and who is the true lord of the land, to be flogged up a steep hill until all his wounds open. When, after a month, the wounds have healed, Taulat returns to inflict the same injuries again. The encampment is made up of men who have attempted to save the injured knight from this fate. The lamentations are those of the tortured man's true vassals, who cry with the hope that the injured man may one day be delivered to them. The elder lady tells Jaufre that Taulat's next visit will be in eight days' time, so Jaufre departs, promising to return in eight days. =The Black Knight: 5170‚Äì5660= Jaufre comes across a hunger-stricken old lady sitting under a pine tree, who tries to bar Jaufre‚Äôs way, but he passes anyway. Approaching a chapel, he is stopped by a demonic black knight, who attacks him without cause. They fight all day and all night, until a hermit comes out of the chapel the following morning and dispels the demon. The hermit explains that the old lady had had a giant as a husband, who had wrought destruction across the land. When an adversary killed her husband, she feared for her life, and evoked the demon of the black knight to guard her and her two sons. One of her sons had been a leper, and had just been killed; the other son was a giant, and had gone off in search of his brother's killer (Jaufre), to return in eight days. Jaufre says that he will wait for him at the hermitage. =The Giant: 5661‚Äì5840= The giant arrives, bearing a young girl he has abducted. Jaufre fights him and conquers, recognises that the girl is Augier's daughter, and takes her on horseback in the direction of her father's house. =Taulat de Rougemont: 5841‚Äì6684= Before they get to Augier's castle, however, they pass the castle of the tortured knight. As eight days have passed, Taulat has returned to inflict his monthly torture. Yet Jaufre provokes him, fights, and conquers. Taulat begs Jaufre's mercy, but Jaufre lets the tortured knight decide Taulat‚Äôs fate. Taulat's wounds are staunched, and he is carried to the court of King Arthur. Jaufre asks Taulat to tell Kay that Jaufre will get revenge for the way Kay mocked him. Jaufre and Augier's daughter continue on their way. Meanwhile, Taulat arrives at the court of King Arthur just as a young lady arrives, asking for Arthur's knights' protection against a criminal, but no one steps forward to champion the lady's cause, so she leaves. Presenting himself to King Arthur, Taulat confesses his guilt and Arthur and Guinevere pardon him. However, as Jaufre had allowed the tortured knight to decide Taulat's fate, he is condemned for seven years to undergo the same torture as he had inflicted on others. =Augier's Daughter: 6685‚Äì6923= Meanwhile, Jaufre arrives at Augier's castle with Augier's daughter. Augier, with his sons, comes out to meet Jaufre, lamenting at the loss of his daughter and not recognising her because she looks so beautiful on Jaufre's palfrey. Jaufre is sorry to hear of the loss of Augier's daughter, but presents him with the girl on his palfrey as a replacement. Augier recognises his daughter, and gives Jaufre a warm welcome. In spite of Augier's insistence that he should stay, Jaufre departs the following day for Brunissen‚Äôs castle, escorted part-way by Augier. =Brunissen: 6924‚Äì7978= Brunissen's seneschal, who had been sent off in search of Jaufre, meets Jaufre and Augier, and promises Jaufre a warm reception at Monbrun. The seneschal then returns to Monbrun without Jaufre, to inform Brunissen of Jaufre's imminent arrival. Brunissen leaves the castle to meet Jaufre, presenting him with a flower. They enter Monbrun, and have a feast. That evening, neither Jaufre nor Brunissen can sleep for thinking of each other. Brunissen, in particular, thinks of famous lovers, and tells herself that she will be bold. The following day, Jaufre is timid, and Brunissen speaks. Neither is willing to express their feelings directly, until Jaufre passionately admits his love for Brunissen. Brunissen says she would like to get married under the auspices of King Arthur. =Melian de Monmelior: 7979‚Äì8326= Jaufre and Brunissen go to the castle of Brunissen's lord, Melian de Monmelior. Before they arrive, they are accosted by two young ladies in tears, who say that in four days' time one of them will have yield their castle to a criminal. They had tried to seek help at the court of King Arthur, but in vain. Jaufre apologises, but says he is unable to help them. Melian arrives to meet them with his prisoner, Taulat, and they all return to Monbrun. Jaufre confides his plans of matrimony to Melian. Melian agrees to the marriage, and confirms this with Brunissen. =Felon d'Auberue: 8327‚Äì9426= Taulat departs for the castle where he will be kept prisoner. Melian, Augier, Jaufre and Brunissen depart for Arthur's court at Cardeuil. They arrive at a meadow, where there is a fountain. A young girl can be heard crying for help: her lady is drowning in the fountain. Jaufre runs to her aid, tries to lift the lady out of the fountain with his lance, but fails. The young girl then pushes him into the fountain. Jaufre disappears underwater. Melian, Brunissen and Augier presume him to have drowned. They all despair and mourn Jaufre's death. Jaufre, however, is taken through the fountain to an underground world. The lady who had feigned drowning turns out to be the same one who had asked for Jaufre's help several days before, to no avail. In spite of the ruse, Jaufre promises to defend the lady's castle against the criminal, Felon d'Auberue. Felon arrives with a fascinating hunting bird. Jaufre is insulted by Felon, attacks him, and is victorious. Felon delivers himself up to Jaufre and the lady of the castle. Jaufre pardons him, and has his wounds staunched. They dine in the magical underground world that evening, with the lady promising to return Jaufre to Brunissen the following day. The lady makes Felon give Jaufre the bird, to present to King Arthur. They set off the following morning, and return to the upper world through the same fountain. Augier, Melian, Brunissen, and her seneschal are overjoyed. The lady from the underground world apologises to Brunissen for kidnapping Jaufre. Melian says that they will depart for Cardeuil at dawn. =Wedding at Cardeuil: 9427‚Äì10248= In front of the castle of Cardeuil, ten knights are cajoling Kay into coming outside. When Jaufre arrives, he punishes him for his mockery, knocking him off his horse with a peacock/horn, and forcing him to walk back into the castle. Jaufre introduces Brunissen to Guinevere. Arthur and Guinevere agree to preside over the marriage. On the eighth day, 100,000 knights from all across the kingdom invited by King Arthur arrive with their ladies. The Welsh archbishop says mass and marries Jaufre and Brunissen. Afterwards, dinner is served. Whilst jesters are playing and singing, a knight cries 'to arms!' and describes an enormous bird which nearly made off with him. King Arthur goes to see what is the matter on his own, on foot. The bird lifts King Arthur in its talons and flies around, in sight of the knights and ladies, who tear their clothes to shreds in their desperation. The knights talk of slaughtering cattle to lure the bird down to earth. The bird, however, takes Arthur back to the castle and metamorphoses into the magician knight. The king pardons, and sends for all the master tailors to come to his court and make lavish clothes to replace those torn to shreds. Eventually, they all retire to bed. =Fairy of Gibel: 10249‚Äì10691= Departing from Cardeuil, M√©lian, Jaufre and Brunissen are accompanied part-way by Arthur and Guinevere. At night, they camp by the fountain in the meadow. In the morning, chariots, knights, and the lady of the underground kingdom appear from out of the fountain. Jaufre and M√©lian distrustfully prepare themselves against attack, but the lady promises them her goodwill, and erects great tents where they can enjoy a nuptial meal. The lady offers Jaufre the tent as a gift, and casts a magic spell on him to protect him against savage beasts; she gives Brunissen the gift of pleasing everyone who sees her, whatever she says or does; she gives M√©lian the assurance that he will never be a prisoner again; she offers their entourage a chariot full of gold and precious objects. After Jaufre thanks her, the lady tells Jaufre her name: she is the Fairy of Gibel of the castle of Gibaldar (i.e. Morgan le Fay as ruler of Mongibel).Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages : A Collaborative History ed. Roger Sherman Loomis, pub. Oxford University Press 1959, special edition for Sandpiper Books Ltd. 2001, Brunissen, Jaufre and M√©lian depart. =Return to Monbrun: 10692‚Äì10956= At Monbrun, the people come out to welcome Jaufre, Brunissen and Melian. Jaufre promises to defend the inhabitants of Monbrun loyally. The old woman, who is mother of the leper and giant Jaufre killed, says that she will no longer bar the path with magic. Jaufre allows her to keep her possessions. The following day they hold a feast at Monbrun; in the evening, all the knights retire, except for M√©lian and his entourage. Jaufre and Brunissen eventually retire to bed. The next morning, M√©lian jokes about consummation. They hear mass and have lunch, before M√©lian departs to impose his punishment on Taulat. Jaufre asks M√©lian to let Taulat go without punishment this first time. M√©lian takes his leave, and Jaufre lives happily ever after at Monbrun. The poet ends by asking God to pardon the writer of the work, and be favourable to the one who \\"achieved\\" (completed) it.  Author and dating  Jaufr√© is quite possibly the product of two anonymous authors, \\"the one who commenced the work and the one who completed it\\" referred to in the explicit to the work. The laudatory passages to the King of Aragon on vv. 2616‚Äì2630 may be the demarcation where the second poet intervened to continue the tale. But none of the arguments are conclusive. One clue for dating is the dedication of the work to the young King of Aragon (also the Count of Barcelona), who has been identified variously as Alfonso II (r. 1162‚Äì1196), Peter II (r. 1196‚Äì1213), or James I (r. 1213‚Äì1276). Depending on the scholar, the dates assigned to the work span the reigns of these three monarchs, anywhere from c. 1170 to 1225/1230, or even later. Against a later dating is the fact that James I did not really win his first battle against \\"those who do not believe in God\\" (presumably the Saracens), and the poem is quite explicit about this point.Jaufr√©. Traducci√≥n Fernando G√≥mez Redondo. Madrid: Gredos, 1996, pp. 10-12. Alfonso, by contrast, who was king as a teenager and defeated the Muslims of Spain in 1169, was also a patron of trobadours. This would make the first part if the poem as old as the early 1170s. A later dating however is suggested by the likely influence of the romances by Chr√©tien de Troyes. It could be interpreted that, ignoring a previous failed expedition to Pen√≠scola, the poet refers to the sensational conquest of Majorca in 1229-1231, when king James was in his early twenties. Among the camp who supported the earlier dating was scholar Rita Lejeune, who ventured to suggest that the romance may have been one of the sources that Chr√©tien de Troyes drew upon. But that prospect is discounted by the majority of scholars, who believe rather that Jaufre was a work by poet(s) who came afterwards and gained \\"intimate knowledge\\" Chr√©tien's works. The literary style also points to a later date, for instance, King Arthur is portrayed in somewhat negative light, and a \\"certain stiflement of adventures\\".  Texts and translations  There are two complete manuscripts of the text: Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale, fran√ßais 2164 (designated A), illustrated, dating from c. 1300; and Paris, Biblioth√®que nationale, fran√ßais 12571 (designated B), an early 14th-century exemplar by an Italian copyist. Five fragments have also survived. Among modern editions, those that use ms. A as the base text include 's (1943), as well as Ren√© Lavaud and Ren√© Nelli's (1960) with facing translation in modern French. The ms. B text appeared in an abridged form (c. 8900 lines) in Raynouard's Lexique Roman (1838), but later published complete in Hermann Breuer edition (1925). A critical text using B as base by Charmaine Lee (2006) is also openly available in electronic format. The first modern translation was by published 1856, illustrated with twenty woodcut engravings by Gustave Dor√©, using the abridged ms. B text printed in Raynouard's Lexique Roman. The Mary-Lafon translation was set in English that same year by Alfred Elwes, printed in London as Jaufry the Knight and the Fair Brunissende (1856), with an American edition printed in New York (1857). Ross G. Arthur's English translation follows the ms. A text. Early adaptations In the 16th century, the Occitan romance was adapted into French prose by Claude Platin, who incorporated elements of another romance, Renaud de Beaujeu's Le Bel Inconnu. The resulting m√©lange was published under the title L'hystoire de Giglan filz de messire Gauvain qui fut roy de Galles. Et de Geoffroy de Maience son compaignon, tous deux chevaliers de la Table ronde (Lyons, c. 1530). But Schofield found that 1539 edition was actually published by \\"Hilles et Jaques Huguetan fr√®res\\" in Lyons. Plantin's version was later given an 18-page summary entitled \\"Geoffroy de Mayence\\" in the (1777) by the Comte de Tressan. A 16th century Spanish prose version also appeared, commonly referred to as ' in shorthand (first published 1513 under the full title: La coronica (sic.) de los nobles caualleros Tablante de Ricamonte y de Jofre hijo del conde Donason). It proved popular and underwent a number of reprints in chapbook format into the 19th century. The Spanish prose was in turn translated into Tagalog verse in the Philippines. Material from the Spanish version was also incorporated into Portuguese chapbooks of the 18th century, compiled by Ant√≥nio da Silva. Taulat de Rougemont The cruel knight Taulat de Rougemont also appears (as Talac de Rougemont) in the Romanz du reis Yder. Another feature in common between the two romances is the motif of a blow to the stomach associated with a queen: in the Yder this takes the form of a kick delivered to rebuff the (apparently) amorous advances of a queen (the wife of King Ivenant) in the context of a chastity test,Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, ed. by J. R. R. Tolkien and E. V. Gordon, 2nd edn rev. by Norman Davis (Oxford: Clarendon, 1967), p. xviii. while (as noted above) in Jaufre, the blow is the (unexplained) stabbing of a knight (by Taulat) in the presence of Queen Guinevere. Under the name Tablante de Ricamonte it is Taulat (and not Jofre) who is given the role of eponymous protagonist in the Spanish prose version of Jaufre. Some light may be cast on the antecedents of Talac/Taulat by the fact that, in Yder it is at Rougemont that Yder finally encounters his father, Nuc, for whom he has been searching from the outset, in an effort to remedy his bastardy (and in which endeavour he is finally successful). The character of Yder is derived from a Welsh deity, Yder being derived from Edern ap Nudd.

He was prebendary of Exeter, and vicar of Hendon. Graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1835 after studying at Southwark, he became a teacher of classics at a number of schools in southern England, and from 1846 to 1856 was headmaster of a school in Falmouth, Cornwall. He was also for 15 years rector of Gerrans, Cornwall. Initially making a name for himself editing the Codex Bezae Cantabrigiensis, Scrivener edited several editions of the New Testament and collated the Codex Sinaiticus with the Textus Receptus. For his services to textual criticism and the understanding of biblical manuscripts, he was granted a Civil list pension in 1872. He was an advocate of the Byzantine text (majority text) over more modern manuscripts as a source for Bible translations. He was the first to distinguish the Textus Receptus from the Byzantine text. Scrivener compared the Textus Receptus with the editions of Stephanus (1550), Theodore Beza (1565), and Elzevier (1633) and enumerated all the differences. In addition he identified the differences between the Textus Receptus and editions by Lachmann, Tregelles, and Tischendorf. Scrivener doubted the authenticity of texts like Matthew 16:2b‚Äì3, Christ's agony at Gethsemane, John 5:3.4, and the Pericope Adulterae. In 1874, he became prebendary of Exeter and vicar of Hendon, where he remained for the rest of his life.

Sixten was born in Sk√∂vde, Sweden. He earned his Bachelor of Arts (1986) at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. He studied composition with Professor Sven-David Sandstr√∂m and is now recognized as one of Sweden's best-known composers of church music.http://sverigesradio.se/diverse/appdata/isidor/files/2482/13176.pdf He is published at all major publishing houses in Sweden. He was the conductor of Gothenburg's boys choir between 1997 and 2001. Today he is the cathedral organist of H√§rn√∂sand's Cathedral. His music is represented on several CD recordings and as a conductor one of his five CDs went gold. His music has been performed on Swedish Radio, e.g. his En svensk Markuspassion for two choirs, chamber orchestra and soloists (2004). The Jazz mass was performed 1999 on Swedish television.  Music  Sixten writes first and foremost church music, particularly liturgical music for choir and organ in a variety of combinations. In addition he has also written a number of chamber music compositions. His music is the product of an eclectic and comprehensive knowledge of musical history, with the ¬´Master of the Baroque¬ª, Johann Sebastian Bach, and 20th century French composers as significant sources of inspiration. Sixten‚Äôs musical language also integrates various aspects of jazz technique and of the folk music of his native Sweden. Most of his works are traditional in structure. His production ranges from large-scale works, such as operas, oratorios and passion to chamber works, including sonatas, toccatas and preludes, not to mention a multitude of contributions to the choral repertoire. His treatment of the traditional forms is nevertheless characterized by a forward-looking attitude, which includes local and regional forms of expression, an interest in gender roles and a generally contemporary tonal language. These aspects are evident in En svensk Markusspassion, written in 2003, which is the first setting of the passion in Swedish influenced by Swedish folkmusic , and the first work to use a female singer in the role of Evangelist ever. With his background as a practising church musician Sixten has to a large extent written music suitable not only for concert performance but also for liturgical use. He has produced a wide range of material suitable for use by average congregations and choirs. In addition to a considerable number of choral works of moderate difficulty he has also been involved in the revision of the Swedish national hymn book. His attitude towards the listener is also such that his production can be appreciated both by musical specialists and non-specialists alike. Similarly, in his instrumental music Sixten is anxious to communicate by making music which ‚Äúsounds good‚Äù, even though the harmonies can be challenging and the music can take unexpected turns. He does not wish to be regarded as ‚Äútraditional‚Äù or ‚Äúmodern‚Äù, but rather as a synthesis of the two.

The city of Gyanpur is the district headquarters. Bhadohi is one of largest centres of Carpet Industries in India and known as ' Carpet City '. Carpets of Bhadohi have ' Geographical Indication ' tag attached to it. Bhadohi has huge geographical significance and position attached to it due to its location between two culturally important and rich heritage cities of Prayagraj and Varanasi. History Hariharnath Mandir, Gyanpur = Ancient period = According to the epic MahƒÅbhƒÅrata, the Pandavas escaped from Lakshyagrah through a tunnel and took shelter here at a place called Semradhnath. It is also said that Mata Sita, wife of lord Rama, lived here in the ashram of Maharshi Balmiki when she was abandoned by Lord Rama. Here, Lav and Kush were born and Mata Sita immersed herself in the lap of goddess Earth. = Medieval period = Bhadohi supposedly gets its name from Bhar Raj of the region which had Bhadohi as its capital, whose traces can be found in the names of ruined mounds and old tanks named after the Bhar rulers, a tributary of Kannauj kingdom, which in the early medieval period was included in the Kingdom of Jaunpur. During the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar, Bhadohi was made a dastur and included in the sarkar of Allahabad. By the fifteenth century the Bhar were overpowered by Monas Rajputs with Sagar Rai as the first head of the clan, and his grandson, Jodh Rai received it as a zamindari sanad (deed) from Mughal Emperor Shah-e-Jahan. However around 1750 AD due to non-payment of land revenue arrears, Raja Pratap Singh of Pratapgarh, in lieu of his paying the arrears gave the entire pargana to Balwant Singh of Benaras, subsequently he received it directly under a sanad from Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula of Awadh under British influence in 1770 AD. In 1911, Bhadohi came under first Maharaja of the newly created princely state of Benares ruled by Maharaja Prabhu Narayan Singh and it remained with Benaras till 1947. =Modern period= Bhadohi was created on 30 June 1994 as the 65th district of the State.

Most of the production is aimed at foreign countries. Well-known carpet types from Bhadohi include cotton Dhurries, Chhapra Mir carpets, Abusan, Persian, Loribaft, Indo Gabbeh but also Nepalese carpets and more recent shaggy type carpets.

Bhadohi will be the 37th town in India to get this status. The tag would help put the carpet city on the world map.

A community channel is a form of community television, much like public-access television cable TV in the United States and other forms of citizen-produced content. The provision of a community channel is required by CRTC regulations governing the licensing of cable companies. Cable companies are required to allocate a small percentage of cable subscription revenues for the provision of a community channel. As of 2009, this amounted to over $116 million annually in Canada.para11, Review of community television policy framework, Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2009-661, http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2009/2009-661.htm The community channel is viewed as a public trust that the cable companies manage on behalf of the Canadian public. In 2016, the CRTC enacted rules allowing television providers in metropolitan markets (population of 1 million or higher) to allocate the required investment to the local news departments of a co-owned terrestrial television station instead, in lieu of operating a community channel. In the wake of the changes, Rogers Cable and Shaw Cable began to wind down their community channels in larger regions to take advantage of this policy. Community television services remain mandatory among television providers in smaller markets (or if not co-owned by a local owner of broadcast stations). History In Canada, citizen media has roots going back to 1922 when filmmaker Robert Flaherty brought in an Inuit hunter to participate in Nanook of the North. In the 1960s this film was cited as an inspiration by a group of filmmakers associated with the National Film Board of Canada, whose Challenge for Change project was part of Canada's War on Poverty. In 1967 Challenge for Change contributed to a prototype studio where people were free to help shape community media. More public access experiments followed. The Canadian Radio- television and Telecommunications Commission required cable companies to provide public access on July 16, 1971. In 1997, the CRTC deregulated community television in Canada, causing a protracted period of political tension between cable companies and community groups. After complaints to the CRTC from the Canadian public, a policy review process was initiated, culminating in CRTC Decision 2002-61, a reinvigoration of the participatory elements of the community channel. Under 2002-61, community channels can be run by independent community groups, and up to one-half of the channel must be made available for independent community producers. In 2016, the CRTC enacted a policy stating that a television provider which also owns television stations within a metropolitan market they serve (defined as having a population higher than 1 million) can re-allocate funding normally devoted to community television to support the news departments of their local broadcast television stations. Subsequently, Shaw Communications announced in April 2017 that it would wind down its Shaw TV community channels in Calgary, Edmonton, and Vancouver on August 15, 2017, and shift their funding allotments to the Global stations (owned by sister company Corus Entertainment) in each market. Rogers Cable similarly announced that it would cut back on its Rogers TV services in the Greater Toronto Area for similar reasons, shutting down four channels (including Brampton, Richmond Hill, Mississauga, and Toronto) and cutting staff at others (thus transferring the funding to Citytv). Branding Large companies may brand all of their community channels similarly ‚Äî for example, all community channels operated by Rogers Cable are branded as Rogers TV, and Cogeco Cable's channels are branded as YourTV. Such systems may also share some of their more general interest programming. For example, the Toronto-produced movie review series Reel to Real aired on all Rogers Television channels throughout Ontario. Prior to the Telecable system in Saskatoon being taken over by Shaw Communications, its designated community-access channel was branded Telecable 10. In markets served by more than one cable company, the cable companies may also produce a single community channel through shared ownership ‚Äî Cable 14 in Hamilton is a notable example of this. More rarely, a cable company may offer more than one community channel. For instance, in Ottawa and some communities in New Brunswick, distinct channels serve the anglophone and francophone communities, while in Vancouver, Shaw Cable produces a multicultural programming channel in addition to the primary community channel. Programming Community channels commonly broadcast a mix of public access television and community service programming such as city council meetings, sports broadcasts or local talk shows. Under CRTC policy 2002-61, up to one half of the air time of the community channel must be made available to independent community producers. Some community channels produce and show full programs, while others predominantly adopt the format of a local news channel with a constant rotation of news, public affairs and human interest reports. When not broadcasting live programming, a community channel typically displays a bulletin board of community event listings. Cable companies sometimes collaborate with volunteer committees to produce programming of community interest. Through their community programming initiatives, community channels have often been leaders in media diversity in Canada ‚Äî for example, community channel programs such as Coming Out, Gay News and Views and 10% QTV were the first Canadian television programs targeted to LGBT audiences in Canada. Community channels also frequently broadcast local minor or junior league sporting events, such as OHL, QMJHL or WHL hockey games. In provinces which do not operate a dedicated legislature broadcaster channel, community channels may also air some proceedings of the provincial Legislative Assembly. While Canadian community channels are expected to make efforts to solicit program proposals from the public, nowadays despite the many requests for airtime it is relatively uncommon (compared to American public-access television cable TV channels) for a proposal from an individual member of the public to make air. Community groups and cable companies disagree as to the best way to manage the public-access television channel assets. Many cable companies develop system- wide formats which fill up much of a local channel's schedule - for instance, several Rogers Television channels air programs entitled Daytime, First Local, or (City/Region) Living. Community groups want access to airtime for their independently produced programs. In February 2015, the CRTC reprimanded Vid√©otron ‚Äî a major cable provider serving Quebec ‚Äî for not producing enough programming of local interest for its Montreal community channel MAtv. It cited arguments by non-profit group ICTV, including networking of programming between MAtv outlets across the provider's footprint, and insufficient community involvement in the production of its programming (including a number of programs produced by an in-house team of professional staff, and rejecting a number of programs by citing insufficient production capacity ‚Äî a claim the CRTC felt was unsubstantiated). The CRTC ordered MAtv to establish a community advisory board. A notable community channel success story is Tom Green, whose guerilla gross-out comedy first appeared on Rogers Television in Ottawa. Some other personalities who have been associated with community channel programming include Catherine Clark, Jacqueline Hennessy and Dale Goldhawk. Terrestrial television The term community channel may also refer to a conventional broadcast station ‚Äî such as, CFTV-DT in Leamington, Ontario, CFSO-TV in Cardston, Alberta, CHCO-TV in St. Andrews, New Brunswick, and CIMC- TV in Arichat, Nova Scotia ‚Äî owned and operated by a local non-profit organization to serve a similar function. Terrestrial community stations are offered only where a local group has presented a viable business plan to the CRTC and been awarded a license ‚Äî unlike cable community channels, it is not mandatory that a terrestrial community channel be made available in any given market. Cable companies may also apply to the CRTC for relief of carriage responsibilities on the basic cable tier, such as in the case of CFTV, which is carried on digital basic cable. One of the most famous attempts to launch a terrestrial community station in Canada, Star Ray TV, became notable when its owner began operating it as a pirate television station after failing to secure a CRTC license. On occasion, a cable community channel may itself be awarded a license to broadcast terrestrially in addition to its cable television carriage. Examples include NAC TV in Neepawa, Manitoba and T√©l√©-Mag in Quebec City. This occurs most frequently in smaller communities that have no commercial media service of their own.

The ratio of milk to whey usually is 9-to-1. It is commonly a truncated cone, but when shipped in containers may be crumbled, as it is removed. It may be unpasteurized, where law allows. Milk is boiled at moderate temperature for ten minutes and then rennet and salt is added, while ruffling. The mix is left in large shallow tanks resulting in a part skim mixture. The following day, salt is added to the mix which is then poured into a basket with tulle and is left to drain. Salt is added every day for another three to four days. At this stage, the cheese is still fresh but less soft. If left to mature, thick salt is often added to cover the exterior. The fresh variant is dry, white, soft or medium hardness, with a sweet, creamy taste, with no rind and no salt. It might be eaten for breakfast with honey and fruit, or in savory dishes with oil, tomato and wild herbs. The dry variant is hard, dry, white and salty; it can have a powerful smell similar to sherry. It might be eaten on spaghetti or salads.

It is generally considered part of the Basque Country province of Lower Navarre (Basque: Nefarroa Beheroa).  Geography  Sames lies in the valley of the Adour, a major river running to the Bay of Biscay. It is located on a low plain between the Adour, Gaves, and Bidouze rivers. An outcrop of the Pyrenees rises some 60m over the plain, blocking the Bidouze to the north and east. North of Sames is the hilly country of southern Landes, formed from rocks and soil left by receding glaciers over 20 million years. The Adour valley extends west to the bay, about 35 km away. South of Sames are the foothills of the Pyrenees, which reach a height of 150m just across the river, 600m about 15 km from the commune, and 900m at a distance of 20 km. = Neighbourhoods = The commune is organized into several neighbourhoods, with distinct personalities partly shaped by history: * Le Bourg, a small borough uphill, consists of a cluster of homes around a medieval church. Traces of human habitation have been found dating back to the 3rd century. * Quartier Saint-Jean dates back at least to the late Middle Ages. It developed around a hostel belonging to the Order of Malta that was established around 1445, with a hospital facility and rooms for travellers to and from Spain. Until the late 18th century, the settlement was organised as a self-supporting hamlet and had its own church and graveyard. * Vic Neuf (also known as Vic Nau) is a rural zone with dispersed homes sloping down from Le Bourg to the banks of the Bidouze. * Vic de Lalande is a rolling upland stretching from Le Bourg to the neighbouring communes of Hastingues and Bidache. It was originally farmland but now has many new homes. * Le √éles, a sparse strip of farms along the banks of the Gaves and Adour, derives its name from small river islets that stood there in the 16th century and have since disappeared. (Some similar islets still exist downstream at Lahonce and Sainte-Marie-de-Gosse.) * Moura is a real-estate zone developing around a reservoir that was created in the early 1990s during a huge civil works project for a nearby highway linking Toulouse to Bayonne.  Demographics   Economy  The economy of Sames is based on agriculture, primarily maize, kiwi, and (to a somewhat lesser extent) vegetables. Local craftsmen also make blades and knives in a typical Pyrenean style. Lames de Sames, an artisanal workshop founded by designer and craftsman Christophe Lauduique, has a shop at the nearby seaside resort of Anglet.  History  = Settlement = Artifacts discovered in Sames (such as a set of 3rd-century Roman bronze coins found in the recess of a wall) indicate that some type of settlement, probably agricultural, existed at the hilltop site of Le Bourg in ancient times. The local church‚Äîbuilt in a simple Roman style, which was all that a very rural parish could afford‚Äîhas been dated back to the early 14th century. The first documents mentioning the commune by its current name are from 1255;Capitulaire de l'Ev√™ch√© de Bayonne or \\"Livre d'Or de Bayonne\\", 1255 several minor mentions can be found from throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. The history of the commune is closely tied to the Order of Malta, which, around 1445, built a hostel and hospital on the bank of the Bidouze to supplement facilities in the nearby port city of Bayonne. They named the site after the Order's patron saint, John (in French, Saint Jean), and the neighbourhood was known as Saint-Jean-d'Etchart until the Order left in the late 18th century. (\\"Etchart\\" is most likely of Basque origin; a nearby swampy area is still known as \\"Etchouette\\".) The Order also established a chapel that served as a secondary church for locals, and they sustained their right to be buried there until a royal decree in 1668 forbade it. Several buildings from that period, dating to the early 1600s, are still standing. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a few wealthy landowners built mansions in the village: three on the hilltop (the first around 1775; the other two, more lavish and surrounded by parks and gardens, around 1850) and one in 1807 on the site of the old Order of Malta establishment. = Political control = While Sames itself held no strategic interest, being devoid of any military stronghold, the area at large was in constant turmoil because of rivalries between the powers that ruled the Aquitaine region and northern Spain. Until the late 12th century, the area was part of the province of Labourd, ruled from Bayonne and included in the dukedom of Aquitaine, and hence the realm of France. The local powers were the lords of Guiche, 1.5 km away across the Bidouze, and the Abbey of Arthous 2 km away on the other side of the hills, which was founded in 1160 and served as a staging ground for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. However, in 1193, Richard I of England, who was also duke of Aquitaine and, as such, a vassal to the king of France, agreed to relinquish sovereignty over a strip of land‚Äîlocated next to the Earldom of B√©arn and stretching from the Pyrenees down to the Adour‚Äîto his father-in-law, Sancho VI of Navarre, who ruled over northern Spain. This land was then integrated into the kingdom of Navarre under the name Lower Navarre (French: Basse-Navarre; Basque: Neferroa Beheroa), and thus removed from the realm of France for the next four centuries. Sames, hemmed in at the confluence of the three rivers, remained under French control but found itself politically isolated. It was cut off from the village of Oeyregave to the northeast by the Earl of Orthe's fortress at Peyrehorade, and from the rest of Labourd by the Bidouze river, on the opposite bank of which was set a ring of villages belonging to Navarre. It was also cut off from its southwestern neighbours beyond Bidache, where a fortress was built in 1325 by the Earl of Gramont, and from Guiche to the south, which had a strong fortress dating back to the 11th century. Additionally, in 1289, the Duke of Aquitaine‚Äîwho controlled Bayonne, the only port between Spain and Bordeaux‚Äîestablished a stronghold on the hilltop of Hastingues half a mile away under an agreement with the Abbey of Arthous (which sought protection from the Earl of Orthe). As a result of this isolation, the commune's jurisdictional, police, and fiscal situation were blurred until two decisive steps were taken in the second half of the 16th century: # In 1563, Sames and neighbouring villages to the south were integrated into the new Earldom of Guiche, created by King Charles IX of France on behalf of the Gramont family. Sames was thus clearly reinstated into the province of Labourd. # In 1589, Henry of Navarre became King Henry IV of France, ending Lower Navarre's four centuries of detachment from France. In 1790, when the territorial divisions of France were reorganized by the French Revolution, Sames and its neighbours in Labourd and Lower Navarre were placed in the Basses-Pyr√©n√©es department, later renamed Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques.  Culture  Since 2006, Sames has been the seat (at Quartier Saint-Jean) of an association dedicated to the promotion of lyric arts. The association organizes performances of comic operas for Sames and surrounding communes.

The plot focuses on an American woman and a psychology professor living in Vienna, and, largely told through nonlinear flashbacks, examines the details of their turbulent relationship as uncovered by a detective investigating her apparent suicide attempt. The film was controversial upon its release, being branded \\"a sick film made by sick people for sick people\\" by its own distributor, the Rank Organisation, and was given an X rating in the United States. The film was also shown under the title Bad Timing: A Sensual Obsession before being shelved by the distributor. It went unreleased on home video in the United States until 2005 when The Criterion Collection released their DVD edition. Plot In Cold War Vienna, Milena (Russell), a young American woman in her twenties, is rushed to the emergency room after apparently overdosing. With her is Alex Linden (Garfunkel), an American psychiatrist who lives in the city as a teacher. Through fragmented flashbacks, the narrative depicts the story of their romance, which ultimately amounts to an unhealthy obsession on the part of Alex. Through these developments, Milena is revealed to suffer from depression and is married to a much older man, Stefan (Elliott), whom she occasionally crosses the border to see during the course of her affair with Alex. Though Alex initially enjoys her free-spirited ways, he becomes embittered by her lifestyle, which includes impulsive promiscuity and heavy drinking. Through spying on Milena, Alex becomes emotionally strained, and eventually tries to control her ‚Äì leading to horrifying results, due in large part to very bad timing. Throughout, at the hospital where doctors and nurses fight to save Milena's life, an investigator, Netusil (Keitel), comes to realise that there may be more to her case than a simple suicide attempt. When he discovers the truth, he tries to corner Alex into a confession. Finally the film reveals that Alex raped her when she was unconscious. Later, just before Alex can confess, Stefan arrives and reveals that Milena has survived and is out of danger. Alex returns to America, where, some time later, he sees Milena getting out of a taxi. He shouts to her but she ignores him. Cast * Art Garfunkel as Alex Linden * Theresa Russell as Milena Flaherty * Harvey Keitel as Inspector Netusil * Denholm Elliott as Stefan Vodnic * Daniel Massey as Foppish Man * Dana Gillespie as Amy Miller * William Hootkins as Colonel Taylor * Eugene Lipinski as Hospital Policeman * George Roubicek as Policeman #1 * Stefan Gryff as Policeman #2 * Sevilla Delofski as Czech Receptionist * Robert Walker as Konrad * Gertan Klauber as Ambulance Man * Ania Marson as Dr Schneider * Lex van Delden as Young Doctor Production The film was one of the series of movies greenlit by Tony Williams at the Rank Organisation, who were increasing their production output. Rank made eight films over two years, being mostly conservative choices such as the 1978 film The Thirty-Nine Steps, the third adaptation of the 1915 novel. Bad Timing was the most unusual of the slate of films. While Art Garfunkel was making the film, his girlfriend, Laurie Bird, committed suicide in New York. Release Bad Timing was first shown at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 1980,The Times, 6 March 1980; pg. 13: Berlin's good British films Linked 2016-08-24 and premiered in London on 10 April 1980.The Times, 10 April 1980; pg. 9: The disturbing imagination of Nicolas Roeg Linked 2016-08-24 The film was later shown at the Toronto International Film Festival on 12 September 1980, and was screened in New York City on 22 September, with a theatrical release in the United States on 25 October 1980. =Critical reaction= The film received mixed reviews. Some found it brilliant; others, tasteless. At the UK premiere, film critic David Robinson in The Times praised Nicolas Roeg as \\"a director of panache and individuality, and with an ability to fascinate and compel the attention\\", and wrote about the unusual editing and the carefully staged scenes: \\"In other hands all this might only be deception and distraction, but through these fragmented elements Roeg and his ingenious writer Yale Udoff creates a perfectly coherent and intriguing central narrative and relationship.\\"The Times, 11 April 1980; pg. 10: Roeg's new Curiosity Shop Linked 2016-08-24 Its UK distributor, Rank, were appalled by what they saw; one executive called it \\"a sick film made by sick people for sick people\\".. In response, they removed the Rank logo from all UK prints of the film. John Coleman in the New Statesman gave it a very bad review: \\"[it has] an overall style which plays merry hell with chronology\\".Sinyard (1991); p. 69 On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 50% based on reviews from 8 critics, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10. The film received the Toronto Festival of Festivals's highest honour, the People's Choice Award, in 1980, as well as the London Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director.IMDb Legacy The film's title was used by musician Jim O'Rourke for his album Bad Timing, the first in a trilogy of albums which O'Rourke named after films Nicolas Roeg had made during the nineteen-eighties ‚Äì the other two being Eureka (taken from Eureka) and Insignificance (taken from Insignificance). The film was also a partial inspiration for The Glove's 1983 album Blue Sunshine, a side project of The Cure's Robert Smith and Siouxsie and the Banshees' Steven Severin. According to Smith, the song \\"Piggy in the Mirror\\" from The Cure's 1984 album The Top was also inspired by the film. The film received only a limited release in the US, showing for a brief period in theaters. Due to the notoriety and poor box office results, the film was not initially released on home video in the United States. However, the television rights were acquired by the Los Angeles-based pay cable network \\"Z Channel\\" and aired in heavy rotation, allowing the film to obtain cult status in the 1980s. Fragments of the film were featured on \\"Z Channel: Magnificent Obsession\\" documentary, which for years was the only way for Americans to see the film. On 20 September 2005 the film was released on DVD by the Criterion Collection. This was the first time that the film received official home video release in the United States.

A. \\"Galli-Mari√©\\". In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London & New York, 1992. Career Galli-Mari√© premiered the r√¥le of Mignon in 1866. She was born Marie-C√©lestine Laurence Mari√© de l'Isle in Paris. She was taught singing by her father, M√©c√®ne Mari√© de l'Isle, who also had a successful opera career. Her d√©but came in 1859 in Strasbourg, and she sang in Italian in Lisbon.Curtiss, M. Bizet and his World. New York: Vienna House, 1974. At the age of fifteen she had married a sculptor named Galli (who died in 1861) and thus took her stage name, Galli-Mari√©. √âmile Perrin, the director of the Op√©ra-Comique, heard her performing Balfe's The Bohemian Girl at Rouen and brought her to Paris. She sang at the Op√©ra-Comique until 1885, premiering in Pergolesi's La serva padrona. Her most famous roles were in Thomas's Mignon (1866) and Bizet's Carmen (1875). It was said that at the 33rd performance of Carmen on 2 June 1875, Galli-Mari√© had a premonition of Bizet's death while singing the cards scene in Act III, and fainted when she left the stage; the composer in fact died that night and the next performance was cancelled due to her indisposition.Dean W. Bizet. London, JM Dent & Sons, 1978. Undertaking much touring, she performed Carmen in Brussels (16 January 1876), Naples (the Italian premiere), Genoa, Barcelona, Lyon, Liege and Dieppe before returning in the Op√©ra-Comique revival of the original production on 22 October 1883. In London she appeared at Her Majesty's Theatre in a touring production in 1886, and returned to the Op√©ra-Comique in 1890 to sing in a fundraising performance to erect a monument to Bizet (this was her final performance). She also created the roles of Lazarille in Don C√©sar de Bazan, Vendredi in Robinson Cruso√©, the title part in Fantasio, as well as roles in Lara, Le Capitaine Henriot, Fior d'Aliza, La Petite Fadette, and Piccolino.

The route passes through the counties of Derbyshire, West Yorkshire, Lancashire, North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Northumberland. It is part of the National Cycle Network (NCN). Sustrans founder John Grimshaw calls it 'the best National Cycle Network route of the lot'. The majority of the route follows NCN 68. It also makes use of several other NCN routes including 6, 54, 62, 70, 7, 72 and 1. It has a total length of about . The route was opened in stages in 2002‚Äì03. History The route was devised for Sustrans, a UK, partially government- funded charity that promotes sustainable transport, who were looking for an \\"exhilarating long distance pubs 'n' scenery challenge ride\\" to rival the Sea to Sea Cycle Route (C2C). The northern section, designed by Ted Liddle, was launched in a low-profile way in summer 2002, because of the after-effects of the foot-and-mouth outbreak. Cyclists marked the opening of the entire route in July 2003. Route The Sustrans organization describe the Pennine Cycleway route in three sections: Peak District, South Pennines and North Pennines. It goes through the National Parks of the Peak District, the Yorkshire Dales, and Northumberland, while skirting the eastern Lake District. About 20% is on traffic-free cycleway routes, and the remainder is along quiet low traffic roads. =Peak District= The Peak District section is long. It runs from Derby in the English Midlands to Holmfirth in West Yorkshire, passing Ashbourne, Buxton and New Mills, and includes the traffic-free rail trails at Tissington and Longdendale (also part of the Trans Pennine Trail). The initial section to Etwall is part of National Cycle Network Route 54, and around Buxton short sections of the High Peak Trail and Midshires Way are followed. =South Pennines= The South Pennines section is long, with 18 traffic-free. It runs from Holmfirth via Upperthong, Meltham and Slaithwaite, encountering the M62 motorway as it crosses the dam at Scammonden Reservoir. Passing through Barkisland, Sowerby Bridge, Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge (this part of the route is shared with National Cycle Route 66) to Heptonstall, where the route splits in two. To get to Colne in Lancashire, riders can either head to Burnley and through Towneley Park to join the towpath of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, or past Widdop and Coldwell Reservoirs. Rejoining the canal at Foulridge, through Salterforth and Barnoldswick to West Marton in North Yorkshire, where the route crosses the A59, and on to Gargrave. Continuing through Winterburn and Airton (shared with the Way of the Roses) to Settle, and then Wharfe, Austwick, Clapham, and Ingleton to Dent, Cumbria. After encountering the M6 near Tebay Services, it is on to Orton, Great Asby and Sedbergh, to finish at Appleby in Cumbria. This part of the route includes connections to Kendal and Kirkby Stephen. =North Pennines= The North Pennines section is long, with eight traffic-free. The route runs from Appleby (with a branch from Penrith) to Berwick-upon-Tweed on the Scottish border, passing Slaggyford (where it follows the South Tyne Trail), Haltwhistle, Bellingham and Branton. Between Renwick and Leadgate it briefly follows the A686 road which is also part of the Sea to Sea Cycle Route (National Cycle Route 7). The final ride from Norham is shared with National Cycle Route 1.

Background  The Kundi are a sub-tribe of the Niazi tribe that live in Di khan, Mianwali, Waziristan. In Tank, they have spread along the Tank-Darra Pezu road, extending up to Mulazai and the adjoining Bettani area. The Mulazai is accessible through a road that begins at the old Gul Imam railway station. The area around this road is mainly inhabited by Kundis, with a little pocket of Marwats. The Kundi area acts as a buffer zone between Tank and Marwats connected through the Pezu and Bayan pass. These were the old caravan routes on which the British constructed as asphalt roads. The main villages of Kundis in Tank are Gul Imam, Shahalam, Abezari, Daraki (Makhani), Pai, Nandor (chief of nandoor (Malik misal khan late) and Amakhel. Mulazai is a mixture of Kundi and Syeds from Kaniguram and Marwats in some parts. Pai‚Äö Abizari and Shahalam are the ancestral home villages of Kundi Khans. Kundis populate the majority of Tank District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, some areas in D.I. Khan, some parts of Afghanistan (Zabul), some of the parts in Balochistan. The ancestors of this tribe are from Zabul (Afghanistan) and Kundayghar in South Waziristan Agency. Many Kundis have rendered their services in the fields of education, politics, civil services and judiciary research in Pakistan.

Jethro Tull Between 1967 and 1971 he drummed for Jethro Tull. But he left after the band released its most popular album to that date, Aqualung, to get married and spend more time with his new wife. He was replaced by Barriemore Barlow, a school friend of the group's singer/songwriter Ian Anderson. Bunker said about his decision to leave Jethro Tull while its success was growing: :\\"I had always told Ian, 'If I find the right lady, I'll be gone,' and I did just that. That was just at the start of their world touring in '72, and I wouldn't have been back in England for ages at a time. So I thought that I might as well end it then. Besides, Barrie was always in the background anyway, so I knew I wasn't going to put them in a difficult situation. You must understand that back then, we didn't have any time off; it was non-stop work, and I wanted to spend time with my wife.\\" Later career After Jethro Tull, Bunker recorded and performed as a session musician with a variety of acts, including Blodwyn Pig, Robin Trower, Jude, Steve Howe, Jeff Pain (aka Dicken, formerly of the UK band Mr Big), Manfred Mann, Jack Bruce, Gordon Giltrap, Anna Ryder, Uli Jon Roth, Electric Sun, Steve Hillage, Vikki Clayton, Solstice, Glenn Hughes and Jerry Donahue. He was a session musician on Generation X's second LP Valley of the Dolls (1979).'Running with the Boss Sound', article by Derwood Andrews, 'Mojo' magazine, February 2008. Aviator In 1978 Bunker founded the band Aviator with Jack Lancaster, a former Blodwyn Pig bandmate, later releasing two LP's, Aviator (1979), and Turbulence (1980). Solo works Bunker's debut solo album, entitled Awakening, was released in 1998.

Octave Chanute, railroad and aviation pioneer, is credited with the idea for using date nails as a way of tracking the life of railroad ties. Different railroads used different sized nails with either alpha or numerical markings. An example would be a Southern Pacific Railroad nail with the marking \\"01\\" stamped on the head of the nail. The \\"01\\" would identify the nail as being hammered into a railroad tie in the year 1901. Date nail use has dropped dramatically since the mid-20th century and the advent of more modern maintenance of way equipment. Date nails on American railroads were phased out in the 1970s. Ties are no longer marked in this manner in North American practice, and the nails themselves are now sought after by railroadiana collectors. The Southern Railway never made use of date nails. Date nails are also found on utility poles, sometimes in conjunction with a nail showing the height of the pole in feet. The types of nails may have distinguishing characteristics, such as the date nail having raised digits and the \\"height nail\\" having incised digits. The pole height will be a multiple of five (e.g., \\"35\\" or \\"40\\").

Plot summary  Veniss Underground alludes in several places to the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Like Orpheus, Shadrach descends into the underworld to retrieve his love, Nicola, but here from a cyborg hell, where genetic engineering and DNA splicing create fantastic and horrific creatures. Parallels also exist with Dante's Inferno. Throughout the novel the idea of heaven and hell come into play. Nick looks into the chaotic world in which he tries to find purpose through what is called living art. Nick journeys into the underworld and makes a deal with the \\"devil\\", also known as Quin. As the story progresses, the reader takes on the second person perspective of Nicola and is introduced to a meerkat whom Nicola names Salvador. Salvador (an assassin meerkat sent by Quin) attacks Nicola but she incapacitates him. Nick arrives at Nicola's door and chokes her till she is near death and sent to an organ bank in the underworld. Shadrach comes into play in the third person point of view and takes the initiative of finding his lost love Nicola in the underworld. He finds Salvador injured at Nicola's apartment and cuts off the meerkat's head and attaches it to a plate and renames him John the Baptist. After, with the help of Dr. Fergusen, he finds a partially mutilated Nicola in an organ bank under a pile of miscellaneous body parts guarded by a naked troll. He carries Nicola through the tunnels back to his childhood home and finds a creation of Quin named Candle. Candle leads Nick to the Psyche witch named Rafter. After Rafter decides to try to salvage Nicola, Shadrach takes the action of venturing deeper into the underworld to kill Quin. He finds Nick, now transformed into a piece of living art, being attacked by some in the garbage re-cycling facility. Nick takes Shadrach lower and tells him how to get to Quin by jumping off a moving train with a parachute. Nick pushes Shadrach out of the train only to be shot by Shadrach as he falls. Shadrach manages to open his chute yet he hits the ground hard. Later, he wakes by a beach and an ocean and kicks over a skull where he finds another creation of Quin's called the Gollux. The Gollux tells him the truth while John the Baptist lies, the Gollux leads Shadrach to a ray-like creature named the saylber which Shadrach rides across the ocean and into Quin's world which is actually a very large minnow named the leviathan. He kills Quin and the remote and the whole place explodes. Shadrach climbs up the cliffs back to the subway level. Shadrach retrieves Nicola and takes her to the surface where they are both on a bridge staring at the city which is called Veniss. Critical notes William Thompson of SF Site wrote \\"the author displays his usual bold and imaginative skill, creating a narrative world lush yet spare in detail. It is in description, in imagery, this lean novel most often excels, in VanderMeer's deft ability to capture through brief illustrative portraits what others would require pages to express. Informed by vision, rather than character-driven, his protagonists, by comparison, are more support than lead, acting out their allotted roles, significant most for what they represent than their singular portrayal and needs, or the human sympathy extended each. There is a knit cohesion close in service to the novel's overall themes, an unfolding symbolism and allegory that is ultimately let loose during the final chapters, unleashing a Babel of imagery recalling the febrile panels of The Garden of Earthly Delights. And the themes of the narrative, dramatically yet cleverly revealed, could not be more earnest or timely. Already recognized as one of fantasy's more creative talents, Veniss Underground will only further Jeff VanderMeer's growing reputation for innovative and imaginative fiction.\\" Michael Moorcock of The Guardian noted \\"This is a short, rich book which another writer might easily extend to a bulky trilogy. It makes a welcome change from the huge tomes that still form a wall between the curious reader and the best of our contemporary visionaries, who could well be creating one of the dominant literary forms of the 21st century.\\" References  External links  Review of Veniss Underground at SFFWorld.com 2003 American novels American fantasy novels American horror novels ","title":"Veniss Underground"},{"id":"2942536","text":"Robert Morton Nance (1873-1959) was a leading authority on the Cornish language, nautical archaeologist, and joint founder of the Old Cornwall Society. Nance wrote many books and pamphlets on the Cornish language, including a Cornish dictionary, which is a standard work, and edited magazines and pamphlets about Cornwall, including Old Cornwall, the journal of the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies. Nance was also a nautical archaeologist of distinction and was an originator of the Society for Nautical Research. His insight and learning were displayed in his book Sailing-ship Models which appeared in 1924. He studied art in Britain and France and was both a painter and a skilled craftsman. Work with the Cornish language In 1898, Robert Morton Nance wrote \\"The Merry Ballad of the Cornish Pasty\\".Hall, Stephen (2001) The Cornish Pasty. Nettlecombe: Agre Books Nance began studying the Cornish language in 1904 from Henry Jenner's A Handbook of the Cornish language, although he would later steer the language revival towards mediaeval Cornish. He began to write and illustrate poetry for Arthur Quiller-Couch's Cornish Magazine. }} In 1909, Nance and Jenner met in Falmouth while the former was researching for the book A Glossary of Cornish Sea Words (published only after his death as a memorial volume in 1959). They became friends and spent the next decade researching Cornish and collecting tidbits of traditional Cornish. These were published in a series of papers which were read both to the Royal Institution of Cornwall and the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. Jenner and Nance formed the first Old Cornwall Society in St Ives in 1920. Its motto was \\"Cuntelleugh an Brewyon us Gesys na vo Kellys Travyth\\". By 1924, there were sufficient Old Cornwall Societies to for a Federation, with Jenner as its president and Nance as its recorder. The Federation established the periodical Old Cornwall in 1925. The 1920s to circa 1940 saw Nance and A. S. D. Smith using the works of Edward Lhuyd and Whitley Stokes, as well as Breton grammar, to resolve the issue of syntax and grammar in Cornish. In 1928, on the 21st of September, Nance, Jenner and others held the first Gorsedh Kernow at Boscawen-Un. Twelve bards were made, including Nance who took the bardic name Mordon ('Sea Wave'). In 1929, he published Cornish for All, a work which detailed a version of Cornish based on the Ordinalia and other mediaeval texts, creating the Unified Cornish spelling system and defining the next phase of the Revival. An Balores, the first play written in Unified Cornish, was written by Nance in 1932 and performed that year at the Celtic Congress meeting in Truro. That year, on December 31st, the Western Morning News published a speech by Henry Jenner on the subject of Cornish patriotism in which he wrote \\"Bedheugh Byntha Kernewek\\" (Be Forever Cornish). A group of young Cornish folk who were politically active joined together to form Cornwall's first national political movement, Tyr ha Tavas (Land and Language), taking Jenner's phrase as their motto to lobby parliament. Nance commented at the time: In 1934, with the death of Henry Jenner, Nance became Bardh Meur or Grand Bard of the Cornish Gorsedh. That same year, Nance and Smith published a small English-Cornish Dictionary together. His life's work, a full Cornish-English dictionary, was completed by Nance in 1938. ¬£2000 of the day's money was raised by volunteer donations to pay for the work's publication. It was revised and extended to include an English-Cornish section in 1952. Lyver an Pymp Marthus Selevan, a collection of folk tales from the St. Levan parish written to imitate the style of Cornwall's miracle-plays, was published by Nance in 1939. 1949 saw the chance discovery in the British Museum of the Tregear Homilies. John Mackechnie, the Celtic scholar who discovered them, passed news of the discovery on to Nance. The Old Cornwall Societies began in 1951 to publish a series of small booklets with extracts from Middle Cornish edited in Unified Cornish by Nance and A. S. D. Smith. Including among these texts were Bewnans Meryasek, An Tyr Marya, Sylvester ha'n Dhragon, Abram hag Ysak, Adam ha Seth, Davydd hag Urry and An Venen ha'y Map. Nance served as President of the Royal Institution of Cornwall from 1951 to 1955.Brian Murdoch, \\"Nance, Robert Morton (1873-1959)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 15 Nov 2007 During this time, he worked to improve modern Cornish and publish new editions in 1952 and 1955 of his two dictionaries. In 1954, records were produced of Nance reading the story Jowan Chy an Hor, as well as Boorde's Colloquies and the Lord's Prayer. Before his death in 1959, he remarked: \\"One generation has set Cornish on its feet. It is now for another to make it walk.\\" Personal Life Nance was born in Cardiff to Cornish parents. His father was from Padstow. Nance spent most of his youth living in Penarth and studied art in Cardiff and Hertfordshire. In 1906, Nance moved from Wales and settled at Nancledra near St Ives, Cornwall from where he jointly founded the Society for Nautical Research in 1911.

Prior to his appointment in the Cabinet, he also served as a member of the House of Representatives of the National Diet, representing the 1st district of Ishikawa Prefecture. Hase is also a semi-retired professional wrestler who worked for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). During his affiliation with AJPW, he also served as the chairman for the Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF), which is the governing body for all championships in AJPW. Among other title wins, Hase held the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship once, making him a one-time world champion. Early life Hase graduated from Senshu University in March 1984. He then became a teacher of classic Japanese literature in a high school in Ishikawa Prefecture, before pursuing a professional wrestling career in 1985. =1984 Summer Olympics= Hase also became an amateur wrestler, representing Japan at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He placed ninth in the Greco-Roman wrestling tournament. Professional wrestling career =Early years (1986‚Äì1987)= Originally trained by Riki Choshu, Hiroshi Hase began his pro wrestling career in February 1986, at Carlos Col√≥n's World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. Later that year, Hase went to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where he was trained by Stu Hart and Tokyo Joe. He would wrestle in Stampede Wrestling, under a mask, in a tag team known as the Viet Cong Express with Fumihiro Niikura, with whom he held the Stampede International Tag Team Championship. By 1987, he started to wrestle under his name and unmasked in Stampede Wrestling. By the end of 1987, Hase would return to Japan. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1987‚Äì1996)= When he returned to Japan, Hase wrestled for NJPW's junior heavyweight division, winning the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship twice. He defeated Kuniaki Kobayashi on December 27, 1987 and held it until May 27, 1988, losing the title to Owen Hart. His second reign began by defeating Shiro Koshinaka on March 16, 1989, and held it until May 25, 1989, losing it to Jyushin Liger. In June 1989, Hase and Takayuki Iizuka went to the Soviet Union to be trained in sambo, where he learned one of his signature moves, the uranage. He would also become one of the only wrestlers, Japanese or American, to successfully graduate from the junior heavyweight to heavyweight class. In the 1990s, Hase had many memorable encounters with famous Japanese talents first in New Japan, and later All Japan. In June 1990, Hase had a near-death experience in the ring, after being knocked out by a backdrop from Tatsutoshi Goto. Hase would form a successful tag team with Kensuke Sasaki in March 1990, winning the IWGP Tag Team Championship twice. On November 1, 1990, Hase and Sasaki defeated Masahiro Chono and Keiji Mutoh to win the title and held on to the titles until December 26, 1990, losing them to Super Strong Machine and Hiro Saito. Their second reign came by regaining them from Machine and Saito on March 6, 1991, but lost the titles on March 21, 1991, to The Steiner Brothers. Hase was involved in a classic December 14, 1992 encounter with The Great Muta, in which the \\"Muta Scale\\" was created, due to the incredible amount of blood shed by Muta, which was payback for Muta bloodying Hase on September 14, 1990. Hase and Mutoh were also regular tag team partners; they won the IWGP Tag Team Championship twice. Their first reign began on November 5, 1991, defeating Rick Steiner and Scott Norton in a decision match. They would hold on to the belts until March 1, 1992, losing them to Big Van Vader and Bam Bam Bigelow. Hase and Mutoh won the Super Grade Tag League in November 1993, defeating The Jurassic Powers in the final. On March 16, 1994, Hase defeated Rick Rude to win the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, and he re-lost the title to Rude on March 24, 1994. Hase and Mutoh won their second Super Grade Tag League in October 1994. On November 25, 1994, Hase and Mutoh defeated The Hellraisers to win their second IWGP Tag Team title. They would hold on to the titles until May 1995, as they vacated the titles after Mutoh won the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The following year he announced his retirement from New Japan, only to jump to the rival All Japan Pro Wrestling. His last New Japan bout as a New Japan wrestler was against Kensuke Sasaki on January 4, 1996. He wrestled one more match for NJPW on July 26, 1996, teaming with Sasaki, losing to Riki Choshu and Yuji Nagata. =All Japan Pro-Wrestling (1997‚Äì2006)= After a brief hiatus, he made his return to pro wrestling in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in January 1997. In All Japan, Hase did not contend for any top titles despite his name recognition, as he made politics his full-time job. In 2000, he founded the multi-promotional Bad Ass Translate Trading stable with Mutoh, Taiy≈ç Kea and Jinsei Shinzaki; Hase and Mutoh reformed their team to battle Jun Akiyama and Yuji Nagata on October 8, the rising stars of their respective promotions (NOAH and NJPW), and were defeated in a ceremonial passing of the torch match that highlighted the advancement of professional wrestling in Japan. When Mutoh (along with Satoshi Kojima and Kendo Ka Shin) jumped to All Japan the following year, Hase was seen as having influenced them (if not Mutoh at least) in their decision. Antonio Inoki, who had once preceded Hase to the Japanese Diet, blasted Hase and suggested that he resign his position in the Diet, but nothing came out of this. Hase's final match for 11 years occurred on August 27, 2006. He tagged with Katsuhiko Nakajima & Satoshi Kojima to face TARU, Kohei Suwama, & \\"brother\\" YASSHI of the Voodoo Murderers. The match was originally supposed to have Kensuke Sasaki in it to team with Hase and Kojima, but Kensuke was replaced with Nakajima following an eye injury. Sasaki was still a presence in the match, working ringside to keep Voodoo Murders' heelish antics at bay and entering the ring at one point. Hase pinned YASSHI with a Northern Light Suplex for the victory, ending his in-ring career after 20 years. A week later, he was elected into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. =Retirement= On July 10, 2007, Hase took over the duty of the Pacific Wrestling Federation chairman, after Stan Hansen (who held the position since 2000) voluntarily resigned from the position. On March 17, 2013, Hase announced that he was stepping down as chairman for the PWF after nearly six years. His last day as PWF chairman was June 21, 2013. On July 26, 2017, Hase returned to the ring at a Pro Wrestling Masters event, produced by Keiji Mutoh. Wrestling his first match in 11 years, Hase teamed with Riki Choshu and Tatsumi Fujinami to defeat The Great Muta, The Great Kabuki and TNT in a six-man tag team match. On August 5, 2018, Hiroshi Hase was revealed as the special partner of Riki Choshu and Jun Akiyama on an All Japan show, victorious against Naoya Nomura, Yoshitatsu, and KAZMA SAKAMOTO. His last match to-date came later that month on the 21st, as he teamed up with Taiyo Kea, Shinjiro Otani, and Jinsei Shinzaki for a special one-night BATT reunion on Keiji Mutoh's Pro Wrestling Masters; defeating the Heisei Ishingun team of AKIRA, Akitoshi Saito, Shiro Koshinaka, and Masashi Aoyagi. =Reputation= Among his peers, Hase is highly regarded as one of the most unselfish wrestlers in the professional wrestling industry, always willing to put anyone over. Hase also had the honor of learning under both Antonio Inoki and Giant Baba, making him one of the few that learned under both men. Political career On July 1995, Hase was elected into the Japanese House of Councillors, the upper house of the National Diet, as an independent candidate representing Ishikawa Prefecture. This made him the second professional wrestler-turned-politician to be elected in a parliamentary seat, the first being Antonio Inoki. In 2000, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives, representing Ishikawa Prefecture. From 2005 to 2006, he also served as the Senior Vice Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. As a lawmaker, Hase has primarily focused on issues involving education, welfare, sports, and environment. He is a defender of the Hague Convention and supports legislation intended to ensure visitation rights between children and their parents separated through divorce or other marital disputes in Japan. In 2015, he also led a multiparty caucus intended to examine discrimination against the LGBT community in Japan, a move that is also intended to prepare the country for the upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympics. On October 7, 2015, Prime Minister of Japan Shinz≈ç Abe announced Hase as part of his cabinet, naming him the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

Many of its members also attend services at conventional synagogues. It is an interpretation of Jewish philosophy that was originally conceived by Rabbi Alfred G. Moses in the early 1900s in response to the growing influence of Christian Science and the New Thought Movement. Rather than the paternal God figure encountered in Hebrew tradition, \\"Jewish Science views God as an Energy or Force penetrating the reality of the universe. God is the source of all Reality and not separate from but part of the world and Right thinking has a healing effect\\".Jewish Science groups explore karma, reincarnationJewish News Weekly His fundamental teachings are found in his 1916 book Jewish Science: Divine Healing in Judaism. The movement was institutionalized in 1922 with Rabbi Morris Lichtenstein's founding of the Society of Jewish Science. History Jewish Science shares several principle beliefs with Christian Science and the New Thought movement, and it is intended to function as a counterweight to the Christian elements in both of these movements and strictly maintain its Jewish identity. It was founded by Alfred G. Moses, Morris Lichtenstein and Tehilla Lichtenstein in 1916. It emphasizes the role of affirmative prayer, \\"divine healing\\" and \\"Right thinking\\" as self help methods essential to a Jew's physical and spiritual health, but does not rule out the importance of medical intervention - unlike Christian Science. Jewish Science also incorporates psychology, and concepts about practical spirituality similar to beliefs developed in the New Thought movement. Thanks to radio broadcasts on WMCA and the establishment of the Jewish Science Interpreter magazine the movement attracted numerous adherents, thereby helping its rise to prominence in the Jewish community. Today the Society's \\"Home Center\\" and synagogue is located in midtown Manhattan, NY. The Society also maintains a congregation in Los Angeles California. Also many study groups around the country which focus on each of the main texts of Jewish Science. Affirmative prayer Lichtenstein found affirmative prayer to be particularly useful because, he believed, it provided the personal benefits of prayer without requiring the belief in a supernatural God who could suspend the laws of nature. He considered affirmative prayer to be a method to access inner power that could be considered divine, but not supernatural. He taught that the origins of affirmative prayer can be found in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Psalms, and that affirmations, or affirmative prayers, are best offered in silence.

He was born in Fes, Morocco. In 1976 he established the French geopolitical journal H√©rodote and published a work that shook the French academy, La G√©ographie √ßa sert d'abord √† faire la guerre; its central thesis was that \\"geography was a form of strategic and political knowledge, central to the military strategy and the exercise of political power\\". Lacoste had earlier earned international renown in 1972 during the Vietnam War by publishing a spatial forensics analysis of the US bombing campaign of the Red River Delta. He agreed with claims from the North Vietnamese government that the US was deliberately targeting the hydrological infrastructure of the river in an attempt to trigger flooding and cause mass civilian casualties, which it called a war crime. He is currently co-editor of H√©rodote with Beatrice Giblin and the head of the French Institute of Geopolitics (Institut Fran√ßais de G√©opolitique) at the University of Paris VIII. Lacoste played a key role in reviving the word geopolitics in the French and English languages. The word had been tarnished by its association with the Nazi r√©gime because of German geopolitician Karl Haushofer.

He, Garry St. Jean, and Kelenna Azubuike do the in-studio analysis for all the Golden State Warriors regular season games on NBC Sports Bay Area. He is the younger brother of deceased Philadelphia sportscaster Gary Papa. Papa is a three-time California Sportscaster of the Year Award winner. He also currently cohosts a radio program with John Lund weekdays from 10am-2pm. Career highlights After graduating from Syracuse University, Papa was a member of the Indiana Pacers' television and radio broadcasting team from 1984 to 1986. Then, he moved west and from 1986 to 1997, he was the radio announcer for the Golden State Warriors (including the famous \\"Sleepy Floyd Game,\\" where Warrior Sleepy Floyd scored 51 points against the Lakers in a playoff game). From 1997 to 2000, Papa became the lead announcer on the San Antonio Spurs' telecasts. During this span, he was also the television play-by-play announcer for the Oakland Athletics with Ray Fosse from 1991 to 2003. =Oakland Raiders= Until his dismissal prior to the 2018 season, Papa was play-by-play announcer for the Raiders, alongside his color commentator, former Raider coach Tom Flores. The Raiders hired Papa for the 1997 season, replacing Joel Meyers, who had himself replaced King. His work was very much in the tradition of his predecessor, Bill King. Like King, his touchdown calls were punctuated by \\"TOUCHDOWN, RRRRAID-ERS!!!\\" Papa's best calls arguably were: Tyrone Wheatley's 26-yard run in the Raiders 1999 finale against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium (\\"Wheatley won't go down!!!\\") along with describing the events during the Tuck Rule game,Patriots Snow Bowl when the Raiders seemingly had won a 2001 playoff game during a snow storm at New England after forcing a late fumble, only to see referee Walt Coleman reverse the call after consulting instant replay.

History  Belonging to a wealthy magnate family (Galen clan) that was related to Archbishop Absalon Erlandsen and all others of Hvide clan, he became a clergyman. He was educated in Paris and showed a solid juridical knowledge at visits in Rome. From the start he seems to have represented a stand of opposition towards the royal power and as bishop of Roskilde (from 1250) he was at odds with King Eric IV. His zeal seems to have been a de facto independence of the church in relation to the king and the state power. In many ways this was in accordance with international canonical law and in agreement with the offensive course of the papal policy but in Denmark it was relatively unknown; here king and bishops normally had worked together, the latter recognising the upper hand of the king. In 1254 bishop Jakob was appointed archbishop and by this his real struggle with the king began. King Christopher I strongly resisted the archbishop's wish of adjusting the legislation and juridical right of the Danish church with international canonical law because it meant a severe hampering of the state power, among other things of its financial energy. Furthermore, this might very well make the archbishop the independent ruler of his diocese Scania. After many minor conflicts, archbishop Jakob in 1256 issued the so-called Vejle Constitution, a law that was meant to secure all bishops against any kind of arrest from the king's side by threatening him with an interdict. This law was an open challenge to the king and was far from being supported by all bishops. During the next years Jakob Erlandsen and King Christopher more and more came on collision course and when the archbishop in a critical situation refused to accept the king's son Eric (Eric V) as crown prince he was arrested and imprisoned in 1259. The arrest only partly provoked the expected interdict, but military attacks from the bishop's foreign allies and the king's sudden death weakened the royal party. The same year Jakob Erlandsen was released by the Queen Dowager Margrethe Sambiria, his distant cousin. His new political initiatives against the king however made any reconciliation impossible and in 1263 he fled to Northern Germany. From then the case continued at the papal court in Rome. Jakob spent most of his last ten years in Italy keen on getting satisfaction. He had to handle alternating popes of changing points of view at the same time as he counteracted the Danish government. Denmark was put under interdict and the royal family was excommunicated but it did not yield to the papal verdicts, nor did Jakob get much support from his own church. At last a compromise was reached in 1272 by which the archbishop obtained some concessions. He travelled home in order to get a final solution, but on the way he died on the island of R√ºgen. Modern examinations of his skeleton indicate that he might have been assassinated but nothing is sure. After his death King Eric quite simply cancelled all royal concessions. Jakob Erlandsen's career and defeat shows the great difficulties of carrying through international ecclesiastical legislation in Denmark. The demands of papal supremacy and the authority of the church collided with the traditional Danish view of the division of power. What the archbishop regarded justified demands of clerical immunity and independence meant disloyalty and treason to the king. More interesting is it that much of the population and even many clergymen seem to have shared the royal opinions. Apart from this Jakob Erlandsen's style, his alliances with the foreign enemies of the crown and his intense conduct also seem to have repulsed many possible supporters. His fight was taken up again by his kinsman Jens Grand.

It is one of the important parameters that are used to describe the visual appearance of an object. The factors that affect gloss are the refractive index of the material, the angle of incident light and the surface topography. Apparent gloss depends on the amount of specular reflection ‚Äì light reflected from the surface in an equal amount and the symmetrical angle to the one of incoming light ‚Äì in comparison with diffuse reflection ‚Äì the amount of light scattered into other directions. Theory Specular and diffuse reflection When light illuminates an object, it interacts with it in a number of ways: * Absorbed within it (largely responsible for colour) * Transmitted through it (dependent on the surface transparency and opacity) * Scattered from or within it (diffuse reflection, haze and transmission) * Specularly reflected from it (gloss) Variations in surface texture directly influence the level of specular reflection. Objects with a smooth surface, i.e. highly polished or containing coatings with finely dispersed pigments, appear shiny to the eye due to a large amount of light being reflected in a specular direction whilst rough surfaces reflect no specular light as the light is scattered in other directions and therefore appears dull. The image forming qualities of these surfaces are much lower making any reflections appear blurred and distorted. Substrate material type also influences the gloss of a surface. Non-metallic materials, i.e. plastics etc. produce a higher level of reflected light when illuminated at a greater illumination angle due to light being absorbed into the material or being diffusely scattered depending on the colour of the material. Metals do not suffer from this effect producing higher amounts of reflection at any angle. The Fresnel formula gives the specular reflectance, R_s , for an unpolarized light of intensity I_0 , at angle of incidence i , giving the intensity of specularly reflected beam of intensity I_r , while the refractive index of the surface specimen is m . The Fresnel equation is given as follows : R_s = \\\\frac{I_r}{I_0} : R_s = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\cos i - \\\\sqrt{m^2 - \\\\sin^2 i}}{\\\\cos i + \\\\sqrt{m^2 - \\\\sin^2 i}}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{m^2 \\\\cos i - \\\\sqrt{m^2 - \\\\sin^2 i}}{m^2 \\\\cos i + \\\\sqrt{m^2 - \\\\sin^2 i}}\\\\right)^2\\\\right] =Surface roughness= Figure1:Specular reflection of light from a rough surface Surface roughness in micrometer range influences the specular reflectance levels. The diagram on the right depicts the reflection at an angle i on a rough surface with a characteristic roughness height h . The path difference between rays reflected from the top and bottom of the surface bumps is: :\\\\Delta r = 2h \\\\cos i \\\\; When the wavelength of the light is \\\\lambda, the phase difference will be: :\\\\Delta \\\\phi = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi h \\\\cos i}{\\\\lambda} \\\\; If \\\\Delta \\\\phi \\\\; is small, the two beams (see Figure 1) are nearly in phase and therefore the specimen surface can be considered smooth. But when \\\\Delta \\\\phi = \\\\pi \\\\;, then beams are not in phase and through interference, cancellation of each other will occur. Low intensity of specularly reflected light means the surface is rough and it scatters the light in other directions. If an arbitrary criterion for smooth surface is \\\\Delta \\\\phi < \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} , then substitution into the equation above will produce: : h < \\\\frac {\\\\lambda}{8 \\\\cos i} \\\\; This smooth surface condition is known as the Rayleigh roughness criterion. =History= The earliest studies of gloss perception are attributed to IngersollIngersoll Elec. World 63,645 (1914), Elec. World 64, 35 (1915); Paper 27, 18 (Feb. 9, 1921), and U. S. Patent 1225250 (May 8, 1917)Ingersoll R. S., The Glarimeter, ‚ÄúAn instrument for measuring the gloss of paper‚Äù. J.Opt. Soc. Am. 5.213 (1921) who in 1914 examined the effect of gloss on paper. By quantitatively measuring gloss using instrumentation Ingersoll based his research around the theory that light is polarised in specular reflection whereas diffusely reflected light is non-polarized. The Ingersoll ‚Äúglarimeter‚Äù had a specular geometry with incident and viewing angles at 57.5¬∞. Using this configuration gloss was measured using a contrast method which subtracted the specular component from the total reflectance using a polarizing filter. In the 1930s work by A. H. Pfund,A. H. Pfund, ‚ÄùThe measurement of gloss‚Äú, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 20, 23.23 (1930) suggested that although specular shininess is the basic (objective) evidence of gloss, actual surface glossy appearance (subjective) relates to the contrast between specular shininess and the diffuse light of the surrounding surface area (now called ‚Äúcontrast gloss‚Äù or ‚Äúluster‚Äù). If black and white surfaces of the same shininess are visually compared, the black surface will always appear glossier because of the greater contrast between the specular highlight and the black surroundings as compared to that with white surface and surroundings. Pfund was also the first to suggest that more than one method was needed to analyze gloss correctly. In 1937 Hunter,Hunter, R. S., ‚ÄúMethods of determining gloss‚Äù, RP958 J. Res. NBS, Volume 18 (1937) as part of his research paper on gloss, described six different visual criteria attributed to apparent gloss. The following diagrams show the relationships between an incident beam of light, I, a specularly reflected beam, S, a diffusely reflected beam, D and a near-specularly reflected beam, B. * Specular gloss ‚Äì the perceived brightness and the brilliance of highlights Specular gloss Defined as the ratio of the light reflected from a surface at an equal but opposite angle to that incident on the surface. * Sheen ‚Äì the perceived shininess at low grazing angles Sheen Defined as the gloss at grazing angles of incidence and viewing * Contrast gloss ‚Äì the perceived brightness of specularly and diffusely reflecting areas Contrast gloss Defined as the ratio of the specularly reflected light to that diffusely reflected normal to the surface; * Absence of bloom ‚Äì the perceived cloudiness in reflections near the specular direction Absence of bloom Defined as a measure of the absence of haze or a milky appearance adjacent to the specularly reflected light: haze is the inverse of absence-of-bloom * Distinctness of image gloss ‚Äì identified by the distinctness of images reflected in surfaces Distinctness of image gloss Defined as the sharpness of the specularly reflected light * Surface texture gloss ‚Äì identified by the lack of surface texture and surface blemishes Defined as the uniformity of the surface in terms of visible texture and defects (orange peel, scratches, inclusions etc.) A surface can therefore appear very shiny if it has a well-defined specular reflectance at the specular angle. The perception of an image reflected in the surface can be degraded by appearing unsharp, or by appearing to be of low contrast. The former is characterised by the measurement of the distinctness- of-image and the latter by the haze or contrast gloss. Gloss-samples In his paper Hunter also noted the importance of three main factors in the measurement of gloss: * The amount of light reflected in the specular direction * The amount and way in which the light is spread around the specular direction * The change in specular reflection as the specular angle changes For his research he used a glossmeter with a specular angle of 45¬∞ as did most of the first photoelectric methods of that type, later studies however by Hunter and Judd in 1939,Judd, D B (1937), Gloss and glossiness. Am. Dyest. Rep. 26, 234‚Äì235 on a larger number of painted samples, concluded that the 60 degree geometry was the best angle to use so as to provide the closest correlation to a visual observation. =Standard gloss measurement= Standardisation in gloss measurement was led by Hunter and ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) who produced ASTM D523 Standard test method for specular gloss in 1939. This incorporated a method for measuring gloss at a specular angle of 60¬∞. Later editions of the Standard (1951) included methods for measuring at 20¬∞ for evaluating high gloss finishes, developed at the DuPont Company (Horning and Morse, 1947) and 85¬∞ (matte, or low, gloss). ASTM has a number of other gloss-related standards designed for application in specific industries including the old 45¬∞ method which is used primarily now used for glazed ceramics, polyethylene and other plastic films. In 1937, the paper industry adopted a 75¬∞ specular-gloss method because the angle gave the best separation of coated book papers.Institute of Paper Chemistry (1937); Hunter (1958) This method was adopted in 1951 by the Technical Association of Pulp and Paper Industries as TAPPI Method T480. In the paint industry, measurements of the specular gloss are made according to International Standard ISO 2813 (BS 3900, Part 5, UK; DIN 67530, Germany; NFT 30-064, France; AS 1580, Australia; JIS Z8741, Japan, are also equivalent). This standard is essentially the same as ASTM D523 although differently drafted. Studies of polished metal surfaces and anodised aluminium automotive trim in the 1960s by Tingle,Tingle, W.

J., ‚ÄúMeasuring Appearance Characteristics of Anodized Aluminum Automotive Trim,‚Äù Report No. 650513, Society of Automotive Engineers, May 1965. Potter and George led to the standardisation of gloss measurement of high gloss surfaces by goniophotometry under the designation ASTM E430. In this standard it also defined methods for the measurement of distinctness of image gloss and reflection haze.

In practice, SRM entails creating closer, more collaborative relationships with key suppliers in order to uncover and realize new value and reduce risk of failure.  Overview  Supplier relationship management is the systematic, enterprise-wide assessment of suppliers‚Äô assets and capabilities with respect to overall business strategy, determination of what activities to engage in with different suppliers, and planning and execution of all interactions with suppliers, in a coordinated fashion across the relationship life cycle, to maximize the value realized through those interactions. The focus of SRM is to develop two-way, mutually beneficial relationships with strategic supply partners to deliver greater levels of innovation and competitive advantage than could be achieved by operating independently or through a traditional, transaction purchasing arrangement. In many fundamental ways, SRM is analogous to customer relationship management. Just as companies have multiple interactions over time with their customers, so too do they interact with suppliers ‚Äì negotiating contracts, purchasing, managing logistics and delivery, collaborating on product design, etc. The starting point for defining SRM is a recognition that these various interactions with suppliers are not discrete and independent ‚Äì instead they are accurately and usefully thought of as comprising a relationship, one which can and should be managed in a coordinated fashion across functional and business unit touch-points, and throughout the relationship life-cycle.  Components of SRM  SRM necessitates a consistency of approach and a defined set of behaviors that foster trust over time. Effective SRM requires not only institutionalizing new ways of collaborating with key suppliers, but also actively dismantling existing policies and practices that can impede collaboration and limit the potential value that can be derived from key supplier relationships. At the same time, SRM should entail reciprocal changes in processes and policies at suppliers. = Organizational structure = While there is no one correct model for deploying SRM at an organizational level, there are sets of structural elements that are relevant in most contexts: # A formal SRM team or office at the corporate level. The purpose of such a group is to facilitate and coordinate SRM activities across functions and business units. SRM is inherently cross-functional, and requires a good combination of commercial, technical and interpersonal skills. These ‚Äúsofter‚Äù skills around communication, listening, influencing and managing change are critical to developing strong and trusting working relations. # A formal Relationship Manager or Supplier Account Manager role. Such individuals often sit within the business unit that interacts most frequently with that supplier, or may be filled by a category manager in the procurement function. This role can be a full-time, dedicated positions, although relationship management responsibilities may be part of broader roles depending on the complexity and importance of the supplier relationship (see Supplier Segmentation). SRM managers understand their suppliers‚Äô business and strategic goals, and are able to see issues from the supplier‚Äôs point of view while balancing their own organization‚Äôs requirements and priorities. # An executive sponsor and, for complex, strategic supplier relationships, a cross-functional steering committee. These individuals form a clear link between SRM strategies and overall business strategies, serve to determine the relative prioritization among a company‚Äôs varying goals as they impact suppliers, and act as a dispute resolution body. = Governance = The SRM office and supply chain function are typically responsible for defining the SRM governance model, which includes a clear and jointly agreed governance framework in place for some top-tier strategic suppliers. Effective governance should comprise not only designation of senior executive sponsors at both customer and supplier and dedicated relationship managers, but also a face-off model connecting personnel in engineering, procurement, operations, quality and logistics with their supplier counterparts; a regular cadence of operational and strategic planning and review meetings; and well-defined escalation procedures to ensure speedy resolution of problems or conflicts at the appropriate organizational level. Effective supplier relationship management requires an enterprise-wide analysis of what activities to engage in with each supplier. The common practice of implementing a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach to managing suppliers can stretch resources and limit the potential value that can be derived from strategic supplier relationships. Supplier segmentation, in contrast, is about determining what kind of interactions to have with various suppliers, and how best to manage those interactions, not merely as a disconnected set of siloized transactions, but in a coordinated manner across the enterprise. Suppliers can be segmented, not just by spend, but by the total potential value (measured across multiple dimensions) that can be realized through interactions with them. Further, suppliers can be segmented by the degree of risk to which the realization of that value is subject. = Joint activities = Joint activities with suppliers might include; * Supplier summits, which bring together all strategic suppliers together to share the company‚Äôs strategy, provide feedback on its strategic supplier relationship management program, and solicit feedback and suggestions from key suppliers. * Executive- to-executive meetings * Strategic business planning meetings, where relationship leaders and technical experts meet to discuss joint opportunities, potential roadblocks to collaboration, activities and resources required, and share strategies and relevant market trends. Joint business planning meetings are often accompanied by a clear process to capture supplier ideas and innovations, direct them to relevant stakeholders, and ensure that they are evaluated for commercial suitability, and developed and implemented if they are deemed commercially viable. * Operational business reviews, where individuals responsible for day-to-day management of the relationship review progress on joint initiatives, operational performance, and risks. = Value measurement = SRM delivers a competitive advantage by harnessing talent and ideas from key supply partners and translates this into product and service offerings for end customers. One tool for monitoring performance and identifying areas for improvement is the joint, two-way performance scorecard. A balanced scorecard includes a mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures, including how key participants perceive the quality of the relationship. These KPIs are shared between customer and supplier and reviewed jointly, reflecting the fact that the relationship is two-way and collaborative, and that strong performance on both sides is required for it to be successful. Advanced organizations conduct 360 degree scorecards, where strategic suppliers are also surveyed for feedback on their performance, the results of which are built into the scorecard. A practice of leading organizations is to track specific SRM savings generated at an individual supplier level, and also at an aggregated SRM program level, through existing procurement benefit measurement systems. Part of the challenge in measuring the financial impact of SRM is that there are many ways SRM can contribute to financial performance. These include cost savings (e.g., most favored customer pricing, joint efforts to improve design, manufacturing, and service delivery for greater efficiency); incremental revenue opportunities (e.g., gaining early or exclusive access to innovative supplier technology; joint efforts to develop innovative products, features, packaging, etc. avoiding stock-outs through joint demand forecasting); and improved management of risk. In a 2004 Vantage Partners study, respondents reported that on average, they could save just over $43 million to their bottom line by implementing supplier relationship management best practices. = Systematic collaboration = In practice, SRM expands the scope of interaction with key suppliers beyond traditional buy-sell transactions to encompass other joint activities which are predicated on a shift. * More disciplined and systematic, and often expanded, information sharing * Joint demand forecasting and process re- engineering (has unlocked savings of 10-30 percent for leading organizations). = Technology and systems = There are myriad technological solutions which are purported to enable SRM. These systems can be used to gather and track supplier performance data across sites, business units, and/or regions. The benefit is a more comprehensive and objective picture of supplier performance, which can be used to make better sourcing decisions, as well as identify and address systemic supplier performance problems. It is important to note that SRM software, while valuable, cannot be implemented in the absence of the other business structure and process changes that are recommended as part of implementing SRM as a strategy.  Challenges  * Creating the business cases * Executive sponsorship * Calculating ROI * Developing an SRM sales pitch * Finding vendors who have SRM capabilities  SRM and supplier performance management  Some confusion may exist over the difference between supplier performance management (SPM) and SRM. SPM is a subset of SRM. A simple way of expressing the difference between SPM and SRM is that the former is about ensuring the supplier delivers what has been promised in the contract, which suggests a narrow, one-way process. SRM, in contrast, is about collaboratively driving value for both parties, resulting in lower costs, reduced risk, greater efficiency, better quality, and access to innovation. This requires a focus on both negotiating the contract and managing the resulting relationship throughout implementation, as well as systematic joint value-discovery efforts.

Examples of deferred compensation include pensions, retirement plans, and employee stock options. The primary benefit of most deferred compensation is the deferral of tax to the date(s) at which the employee receives the income. United States In the US, Internal Revenue Code section 409A regulates the treatment for federal income tax purposes of ‚Äúnon-qualified deferred compensation‚Äù, the timing of deferral elections and of distributions.Frequently Asked Questions: Sec. 409A and Deferred Compensation While technically \\"deferred compensation\\" is any arrangement where an employee receives wages after they have earned them, the more common use of the phrase refers to ‚Äúnon-qualified\\" deferred compensation and a specific part of the tax code that provides a special benefit to corporate executives and other highly compensated corporate employees. =Non-qualifying= Deferred compensation is a written agreement between an employer and an employee where the employee voluntarily agrees to have part of their compensation withheld by the company, invested on their behalf, and given to them at some pre-specified point in the future. Non-qualifying differs from qualifying in that #Employers may also pick and choose which employees they provide deferred compensation benefits to rather than being required to offer the same plan to all employees. This flexibility in the law allows for public entities the choice of whether to provide benefits to different employee bargaining units. #They offer flexibility. The employer can treat those chosen differently. The benefit promised need not follow any of the rules associated with qualified plans (e.g. the 25% or $55,000 limit on contributions to defined contribution plans). The vesting schedule can be whatever the employer would like it to be.Non Qualified Deferred Compensation #Companies may provide deferred compensation benefits to independent contractors, not just employees. #The employer contributions are not tax-deductible #Employees must pay taxes on deferred compensation at the time such compensation is eligible to be received (not just when it is drawn out).IRS Limits for Deferred Compensation Deferred compensation is also sometimes referred to as deferred comp, qualified deferred compensation, DC, non-qualified deferred comp, NQDC or golden handcuffs. Deferred compensation is only available to employees of public entities, senior management, and other highly compensated employees of companies. Although DC isn't restricted to public companies, there must be a serious risk that a key employee could leave for a competitor and deferred comp is a \\"sweetener\\" to try to entice them to stay. If a company is closely held (i.e. owned by a family, or a small group of related people), the IRS will look much more closely at the potential risk to the company. A top producing salesman for a pharmaceutical company could easily find work at a number of good competitors. A parent who jointly owns a business with their children is highly unlikely to leave to go to a competitor. There must be a \\"substantial risk of forfeiture,\\" or a strong possibility that the employee might leave, for the plan to be tax-deferred. Among other things, the IRS may want to see an independent (unrelated) Board of Directors' evaluation of the arrangement. =Qualifying= A \\"qualifying\\" deferred compensation plan is one complying with the ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Qualifying plans include 401(k) (for non-government organizations), 403(b) (for public education employers and 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations and ministers), and 457(b) (for state and local government organizations) ERISA, has many regulations, one of which is how much employee income can qualify. (The tax benefits in qualifying plans were intended to encourage lower-to- middle income earners to save more, high income-earners already having high savings rates.) As of 2008 the maximum qualifying annual income was $230,000. So, for example, if a company declared a 25% profit sharing contribution, any employee making less than $230,000 could deposit the entire amount of their profit sharing check (up to $57,500, 25% of $230,000) in their ERISA- qualifying account. For the company CEO making $1,000,000/year, $57,500 would be less than 1/4 of his $250,000 profit sharing cut. It is for high earners like the CEO, that companies provide \\"DC\\" (i.e. deferred compensation plans). In an ERISA-qualified plan (like a 401(k) plan), the company's contribution to the plan is tax deductible to the plan as soon as it is made, but not taxable to the individual participants until It is withdrawn. So if a company puts $1,000,000 into a 401(k) plan for employees, it writes off $1,000,000 that year. #Assets in plans that fall under ERISA (for example, a 401(k) plan) must be put in a trust for a sole benefit of its employees. If a company goes bankrupt, creditors aren't allowed to get assets inside the company's ERISA plan. Contrariwise, non-qualifying deferred compensation, because it doesn't fall under ERISA, is a general asset of the corporation. While the corporation may choose to not invade those assets as a courtesy, legally they're allowed to and may be forced to give deferred compensation assets to creditors in the case of a bankruptcy. A special kind of trust called a rabbi trust (because it was first used in the compensation plan for a rabbi) may be used. A rabbi trust puts a \\"fence\\" around the money inside the corporation and protects it from being raided for most uses other than the corporation's bankruptcy/insolvency. However, plan participants may not receive a guarantee that they'll be paid prior to creditors being paid in case of insolvency. #ERISA plans may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees on a percentage basis. If the president of the company is making $1,000,000/year and a clerk is making $30,000, and the company declares a 25% profit sharing contribution, the president of the company gets to count the first $230,000 only (2008 limit) and put $57,500 into his account and $7,500 into the clerk's account. For the president, $57,500 represents only 5.75% of total income that grows tax deferred, and if the company wants to provide an additional tax incentive, DC may be an option. #Federal income tax rates change on a regular basis. If an executive is assuming tax rates will be higher at the time they retire, they should calculate whether or not deferred comp is appropriate. The top federal tax rate in 1975 was 70%. In 2008, it was 35%. If an executive defers compensation at 35% and ends up paying 70%, that was a bad idea. If the reverse is true, it was brilliant. Unfortunately, only time will tell, but the decision to pay the taxes once the rates have changed is irreversible so careful consideration must be given. =Agreements= Plans are usually put in place either at the request of executives or as an incentive by the Board of Directors. They're drafted by lawyers, recorded in the Board minutes with parameters defined. There is a doctrine called constructive receipt, which means an executive can't have control of the investment choices or the option to receive the money whenever he wants. If he is allowed to do either of those 2 things or both, he often has to pay taxes on it right away. For example: if an executive says \\"With my deferred comp money, buy 1,000 shares of Microsoft stock\\" that is usually too specific to be allowed. If he says \\"Put 25% of my money in large cap stocks\\" that is a much broader parameter. Again, ask legal counsel for specific requirements. =Taxation= In an ERISA-qualified plan (like a 401(k) plan), the company's contribution to the plan is deductible to the plan as soon as it is made, but not taxable to the participants until it is withdrawn. So if a company puts $1,000,000 into a 401(k) plan for employees, it writes off $1,000,000 that year. If the company is in the 25% bracket, the NET contribution is $750,000 (because they didn't pay $250,000 in taxes - 25% of $1M). Why? Because the cash flow is still $1M to the Plan to be withdrawn later by the employees - then when tax returns are filed, since the taxable profit is $1M \\"less\\", there is an on paper \\"savings\\" at the 25% tax rate. In a non-qualified deferred comp plan, the company doesn't get to deduct the taxes in the year the contribution is made, they deduct them the year the contribution becomes non-forfeit-able. For example, if ABC company allows SVP John Smith to defer $200,000 of his compensation in 1990, which he will have the right to withdraw for the first time in the year 2000, ABC puts the money away for John in 1990, John pays taxes on it in 2000. If John keeps working there after 2000, it doesn't matter because he was allowed to receive it (or \\"constructively received\\") the money in 2000. =Other circumstances= Most of the provisions around deferred comp are related to circumstances the employee controls (such as voluntary termination), however deferred comp often has a clause that says in the case of the employee's death or permanent disability, the plan will immediately vest and the employee (or estate) can get the money.  Deferred compensation as incentive  \\"When agents remain with an employer for a long period of time, there is no necessary reason why the employer should pay the worker his expected marginal product in all periods; instead, workers could be paid better in some periods than in others. One aspect of this that has attracted both theoretical and empirical interest has been 'deferred compensation,' where workers are overpaid when old, at the cost of being underpaid when young. From this perspective, part of the reason why older workers are better paid than younger workers is not that they are more productive, but simply that they have accumulated enough tenure to garner these contractual returns.\\" See also *Remuneration *Vesting *Restricted stock External links *IRS web site *IRS article References Employment compensation Plan Personal finance ","title":"Deferred compensation"},{"id":"2942705","text":"Rossignol is a French word meaning nightingale, and may refer to:  People  * Rossignols, a family of French cryptographers * Andr√© Rossignol (fl. 1923‚Äì1928), French racing driver * Bruno Rossignol (born 1958), French choral conductor and composer * Dan Rossignol (fl. 2013), doctor and autism researcher * Felix Rossignol (1920‚Äì1981), Canadian NHL ice hockey player * Jean Antoine Rossignol (1759‚Äì1802), general of the French Revolutionary Wars * Jim Rossignol (born July 1978), British computer games journalist, critic and other * Jules Rossignol (fl. 1900), French fencer * Laurence Rossignol (born 1957), French politician * Michelle Rossignol (born 1940), Canadian film actress * Philippe Lando Rossignol (fl. 1956‚Äì1957), soukous recording artist  Places  * Lake Rossignol, a lake in south-western Nova Scotia, Canada * Rossignol Wood, a forest north of Hebuterne, France Other uses * Rossignol ENT, an experimental automatic rifle * Battle of Rossignol, a World War I battle near Trintigny, Belgium * Le rossignol, an 1842 composition by Franz Liszt * Le Rossignol, a 1914 opera by Igor Stravinsky * Skis Rossignol, a French manufacturer of clothing and sports equipment See also * Rosignol, a village in Guyana * Rossignola, a red Italian wine grape variety French-language surnames ","title":"Rossignol"},{"id":"2942713","text":"Gerry McCambridge is a stage Mentalist from Long Island, New York. He was born Scott Thomas Burns in Brooklyn New York, on Halloween, October 31, 1962 (the same day Harry Houdini died). Immediately after his birth, he was moved to the Angel Guardian Home in Brooklyn, New York, where he was put up for adoption. A few months later he was adopted by Frances Ann McCambridge and Gerard Alexander McCambridge Sr.. After the adoption was final, they changed his name to Gerard Alexander McCambridge Jr.. From the age of 9 years old, Gerard was fascinated by magic. He started to study the art as a hobby. Gerard performed his first magic show at a neighbors birthday party for money at the age of 12. He was billing himself as \\"Gerard the Great.\\" He started apprenticing for professional magicians and touring the country as an on stage assistant at the age of 15. By the time he was 18, he had a full show of his own. It is then he changed his performing name to Gerry McCambridge. Years later he took his love for magic, and mixed it with the observational skills he learned from his father who was a NYC detective and an expert at interrogation, and added a few mentalism routines to his magic show. In 1988 he stopped performing magic completely and focused solely on performing as a mentalist. He has studied memory techniques, body language interpretation, stage hypnosis, linguistics, statistics, law of averages, non-verbal communication, acting, theatre and stand up comedy, to enhance his mentalism show. In the 1980s Gerry was headlining as ‚ÄúGerry McCambridge-The Mentalist‚Äù in Comedy Clubs across the country. He also specialized in entertaining at Fortune 500 corporate events and celebrity ‚ÄúA-List‚Äù parties. Gerry also appeared on countless radio and TV talk shows. In 2002 Gerry dropped his name and billed himself as ‚ÄúThe Mentalist.‚Äù In 1999, the International Magicians Society presented Gerry with the ‚ÄúMerlin Award‚Äù for ‚ÄúMentalist of the Decade‚Äù. Gerry was the first mentalist in history to receive the Merlin award for mentalism since the organizations inception in 1968. In 2002 Gerry wrote his first TV script titled ‚ÄúThe Mentalist‚Äù and took it out to Los Angeles to pitch it to the major networks. Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC witnessed Gerry‚Äôs live performances many times, and instantly licensed the special for his network. Gerry became the creator, executive producer and star of the hit prime-time network television special \\"The Mentalist‚Äù which started airing to 6.2 million viewers in the United States on May 12, 2004. The show then aired in Canada, South Africa, Korea, The Middle East, New Zealand, India, Thailand, Australia, Denmark, The Netherlands, Malaysia and the United Kingdom. In 2004 the Psychic Entertainers Association, an international organization of his peers, awarded Gerry for his ‚ÄúOutstanding Contributions to the Art of Mentalism.‚Äù Also in the summer of 2004 Gerry performed his one man show ‚ÄúThe Mentalist‚Äù to critical acclaim Off-Broadway in New York City and made his acting debut in the movie \\"Mattie Fresno and the Holofulx Universe.\\" In 2005 the Psychic Entertainers Association again awarded Gerry. This time he received the ‚ÄúMentalist of the Year‚Äù award. In June 2005 Gerry moved his one man show ‚ÄúThe Mentalist‚Äù from New York City to Las Vegas. The show was an instant success in Sin City. The Las Vegas Review Journal readers poll nominated him ‚ÄúBest Magician‚Äù in all Las Vegas. Gerry performed for a year of sold out performances at the Rampart Casino. From there, Gerry moved his show to the Legendary Stardust Casino. When the Stardust closed its doors for implosion, Gerry moved his show to Hooters Hotel and Casino. At the end of his 500th Las Vegas performance, Gary Gregg, the COO of Hooters Casino Hotel came on stage to congratulate him. As a token of appreciation, Mr. Gregg presented Gerry with a diamond Rolex watch. In addition, Mr. Gregg announced that Hooters would extend Gerry's million dollar performance contract for another year, and the casino would add a 6th night to Gerry‚Äôs weekly performing schedule. Starting in October 2007 he appeared on a weekly television show titled Phenomenon with Criss Angel, Holly Madison and Uri Geller. In 2008 CBS thought the concept of merging the skills of a mentalist with a detective was so interesting, they contacted Gerry and asked him to help with a weekly TV series based on that concept. In August 2008, the International Magicians Society presented Gerry with the ‚ÄúMerlin Award‚Äù for ‚ÄúMentalist of the Year.‚Äù In 2009 he was voted one of the \\"Top 10 Absolutely Have To See\\" shows in Las Vegas by the Las Vegas Weekly Magazine. In 2010 the Las Vegas Review Journal readers poll placed Gerry's show as the \\"Best Bargain Show in all of Las Vegas.\\" On April 5, 2020, Gerry McCambridge celebrated his 4,000th Las Vegas performance having been in that city for fifteen years. This makes McCambridge the longest running and most financially successful mentalist show in Las Vegas history. In 2014, he authored his first book titled, ‚ÄúMaking the Mentalist‚Äù which told of his never ending desire to be a successful performer, and his battle with sexual abuse at the hands of his high school wood shop teacher.

Although the album is technically Thompson's second studio album, it is typically not referred to as such, with its followup Hand of Kindness usually receiving that label and the numbering of his discography continuing from there.

Produced in-house by BBC Scotland, initially in association with Sony Pictures Television International, the series debuted on BBC One in the UK in February 2004. A second series was shown from January 2005, with a third following in 2006 and then a fourth in April 2007. The programme was created by writer David Kane, who also wrote the entire first series. The final series, unlike the previous series, was an independent production for BBC Scotland by Carnival Films. Overview The central character is Dr. Douglas Monaghan, played by Bill Paterson, who is the head of a parapsychology unit at a fictional university in Glasgow, Scotland. In the first series he is assisted by Megan Sharma (Archie Panjabi) and Dr. Andrew Gemmill (Peter McDonald), but these characters were replaced - without any on-screen explanation - in the second series by Justine McManus (Dawn Steele) and Craig Stevenson (Iain Robertson). The series has seen the team encounter phenomena such as ghosts, reincarnation and voodooism. Each series has consisted of six one-hour episodes, initially comprising three two-part story lines. The first series was shown on consecutive Monday and Tuesday nights, but for series two the transmission days switched to Saturday and Sunday. Other changes introduced in the second series included the introduction of sub-plots to help with the pacing of each storyline, and more Scottish-focused story lines, the first series having been criticised for the characters' frequent trips to London. The third series was broadcast from 7 January - 11 February 2006, each episode airing in a 9.10pm-10.10pm slot. For this third run the format had been changed ‚Äì the series now consisted of six individual one-episode stories instead of three two-parters, with the episodes being shown once per week on Saturday nights. Executive producer and BBC Scotland Head of Drama Barbara McKissack explained the change in format as being \\"a much better, faster paced format for this kind of show.\\" Prominent guest stars in individual story lines have included Peter Capaldi, Siobhan Redmond, James Fleet, John Guerrasio, Paul McGann, John Hannah, Jeff Rawle and Colin Salmon. The first two series have been released on DVD in the UK. The programme has also been shown overseas, including in Australia on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, which showed the first series from September 2005, with series two being shown on Sci Fi in January 2007. It has also been broadcast to South America by HBO Latin America in 2006. In total, the series has been sold to over forty countries as of December 2005. Production The first series was produced by Phil Collinson, but after he left to produce the revival of Doctor Who, Stephen Garwood took over as producer for the second and third series. Awards At the BAFTA Scotland Awards, held on 13 November 2005 at the Radisson SAS Hotel, Sea of Souls Series 2 won an award for Best Drama, beating Taggart and Monarch of the Glen. Cast Dr Douglas Monaghan - Bill Paterson Is the main character over all and has featured in all series so far, though he featured much more predominantly in series one and two. He is dependable and compassionate, and has changed throughout the run of the series. At the beginning Douglas was a sceptic, almost refusing to believe and denying anything paranormal. But as of series three he has become more open to the suggestion that not everything can be easily explained by science. Justine McManus - Dawn Steele After arriving in series two she struggled to gain the respect of co-workers, but one year on is much more self-assured and is enjoying her new-found friendship with Craig. She is a single mother of her 10-year-old son Billy. We have not been introduced to his father, yet he does often look after Billy. She is empathic and considerate and has a knack with people. Right from the beginning it is clear that Justine has several paranormal abilities, she can apparently see the future (which featured in series three episode Oracle), sense things and see the dead. But none of these have been properly looked into as Justine is unsure of finding out the true nature of them. In series three her abilities are shown to be much more powerful than she could ever have imagined, especially when it seems she has passed them on to her son Billy. Craig Stevenson - Iain Robertson Also arrived in series two, Craig is often insensitive and arrogant towards people who seek the department's help, it's clear he's not a people person and he is quick to rush into things. In series three, a new friendship with Justine seems to have done him good. He also loses some of his know-it-all side. Craig's new friendship with Justine also leads to him discover her hidden psychic skills, and it's a revelation that has far-reaching implications for him. In the third series his own beliefs are put to the test, causing him to reconsider his mindset towards the paranormal.

The Ottoman forces were under the command of Hadƒ±m Yakup Pasha, sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia, and the Croatian army was led by Emerik Derenƒçin, Ban of Croatia, who served under King Vladislaus II Jagiello. Earlier in the summer of 1493, the Ottomans undertook a raid through Croatia into Carniola and Styria. Around the same time, clashes had been raging in Croatia between the House of Frankopan and the Croatian ban, but news of the Ottoman incursion forced them to make peace. The Croatian nobles assembled a large army and intercepted the Ottoman forces that were returning to the Sanjak of Bosnia. Poor tactics, and the choice of an open battle with the more experienced Ottoman cavalry, resulted in the total defeat of the Croatian army. There were no immediate territorial gains for the Ottoman Empire, but in the following decades the Ottomans gradually expanded into southern Croatia. Background After the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia into Ottoman hands in 1463, the Ottomans quickly expanded westward, threatening the southern and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia.Alexander Mikaberidze: Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia (2 volumes: A Historical Encyclopedia), 2011, p. 491 Since then, Ottoman raids were becoming more frequent. These raids were being carried out by the Akƒ±ncƒ±, irregular light cavalry of the Ottoman Empire. They would ride into Christian territory and plunder the countryside during spring and summer, avoiding the fortified border towns and direct military conflict. These continuous raids forced the local population to abandon their land, leaving the frontier castles without supplies. One such raid began in September 1491, with the Ottoman cavalry crossing the Kupa River and reaching Carniola. On their way back, the Ottomans were intercepted by the army of Croatian Ban Ladislav of Egerv√°r and Count Bernardin Frankopan near Udbina, and were defeated in the Battle of Vrpile. The defeat at Vrpile forced the Ottomans to stop their attacks during 1492. After Hadƒ±m Yakup Pasha became the sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Bosnia, the Ottomans renewed their raids. Preparations In the summer of 1493, Hadƒ±m Yakup Pasha raised an army of 8,000 light cavalry (akƒ±ncƒ±) and attacked Jajce, but failed to capture its fortress. From there he turned northwest and entered Carniola and Styria, plundering the countryside. The same year, a war broke out between the newly appointed Ban of Croatia, Emerik Derenƒçin (), and the Frankopans, allied with Karlo Kurjakoviƒá (of the Gusiƒá's), for control over Senj and several other towns. By mid-July 1493, counts Bernardin Frankopan and Ivan VIII (An≈æ) Frankopan, had the upper hand in the war and were besieging Senj. The siege was lifted after an army led by Ban Derenƒçin was sent to help Senj, and the Frankopan army retreated to Sokolac. In the meantime, the Frankopans were accused of cooperating with the Ottomans, although their estates were also being ravaged. News of the incoming Ottoman army forced them to make peace.Ferdo ≈†i≈°iƒá: Povijest Hrvata; pregled povijesti hrvatskog naroda 600 ‚Äì 1918, Zagreb, p. 245 On their way back, the Ottomans sacked Modru≈°, in northern Lika, then owned by the Frankopan noble family. The Frankopans and Ban Derenƒçin wanted to intercept the Ottomans, and gathered an army of around 3,000 cavalry and 8,000 infantry from all parts of Croatia, however a part of the army consisted of peasants from the surrounding areas of Krbava. At Derenƒçin's initiative, the Croatian commanders decided to face the Ottoman army in an open battle at the Krbava field, near the town of Udbina in central Croatia, although Ivan Frankopan Cetinski argued that an ambush in the canyons and ravines would be a better option. Battle Maximilian I in Hofkirche, Innsbruck, depicting the Battle of Krbava Field Plan of the battle and troop disposition The Ottomans entered the Krbava field through the lowest and narrowest local mountain pass of Gorica, unlike two years earlier through the Vrpile pass where they suffered a huge defeat. Before the battle, Hadƒ±m Yakup Pasha ordered the execution of Christian captives near Jel≈°ani (present-day Jo≈°an) so that they could not help the Croatians in the midst of battle. After a meeting with the commanders, he sent a part of his army, around 3,000 cavalrymen, to set up an ambush in the forest near the Krbava field. Although the plan was to fight the Ottomans on the open plains, the Croatian army was initially deployed on the slopes of the eastern part of the Krbava field, near the village of Visuƒá. The army was set up to face the enemy frontally, and divided into three groups. The first one was composed of soldiers from Slavonia, commanded by Franjo Berislaviƒá, the second section was under the command of Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, while the third was commanded by Nikola VI Frankopan and Bernardin Frankopan. Croatian infantry and cavalry were equally distributed among the three sections. The main commander of the army was Ban Emerik Derenƒçin. The Ottoman army was also arranged in three groups. The first one was commanded by Ismail Bey, sanjak-bey of the Sanjak of Kru≈°evac, the second one by Mehmed Bey of the Sanjak of √úsk√ºp (Skopje), while the middle group was under the command of Hadƒ±m Yakup Pasha. Ishak Bey Kraloƒülu (Sigismund of Bosnia), son of the King of Bosnia, Stephen Thomas (died 1461), also took part in the battle on the Ottoman side.Ljubez, Bruno (2009), Jajce Grad: prilog povijesti posljednje bosanske prijestolnice, HKD Napredak, p. 149 The Ottoman plan was to draw the Croatian forces further west next to the woods where they had set up an ambush. Ismail's right wing made the first move, heading towards the Croatian left flank. The Croatian army left the slopes and rushed at the Ottomans, starting a battle in the open field. The battle was fought closely with swords, with no use of bows. The Ottoman forces were at first pushed back, and started a feint retreat, which lured Croatian army into pursuit that led them into the ambush. The 3,000 Ottoman cavalrymen located in the wooded area of the Krbava field crossed the Krbava River and attacked the Croatian rear. Then the main Ottoman forces of Hadƒ±m Yakup Pasha, also waiting hidden in the forests, commenced a frontal attack. Thus, the Croatian army was attacked from the front, right, and the rear. The Croatian left flank of Bernardin Frankopan could not withstand the attacks of the Turkish light cavalry and began retreating. However, most of the Croatian infantry was surrounded and could not retreat. The Croatian army suffered a total defeat and only a small number of men managed to reach safety in the nearby fortified town of Udbina. The battle started around 09:00 and ended in the afternoon hours. Ban Derenƒçin was captured in battle and died in captivity, while his brother, and his son Pavao, were killed in battle. Nikola VI Frankopan Tr≈æaƒçki was also captured, but was ransomed and released. Among the killed Croatian nobles were Ivan Frankopan Cetinski, Petar II Zrinski, Juraj Vlatkoviƒá, and ban of Jajce Mihajlo Pethkey. Count Bernardin Frankopan and Franjo Berislaviƒá managed to survive the battle. Aftermath One of the oldest records of the battle, written by priest Martinac in Glagolitic script on 27 September 1493 Although the Croatian nobility suffered a heavy defeat, described by ancient historians and chroniclers as the \\"first dissolution of the Croatian Kingdom\\",Ivan Toma≈°iƒá: Chronicon breve Regni Croatiae the Ottoman Empire had no territorial gains as a result of the victory at Krbava field., cited in Since the losses were heavy, in local tradition the Krbava field became known as the \\"Field of Blood\\" (). Peace between the kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was signed in April 1495. The next major Ottoman incursions occurred in 1512 and in 1513, and resulted in the Croatian victory at the battle of Dubica. Following the battle, and in later decades, due to constant Ottoman attacks, local Croatian populations moved into safer areas; north-west Croatia, the coast and the islands, and also outside the country. Franjo Berislaviƒá became the ban of Jajce in 1494. Historical records Accounts of the Battle of Krbava field have been recorded in various modern and older historical sources. Among the oldest ones are the report of the papal delegate Antonio Fabregues written on 13 September 1493, in Senj, a record from the Bohemian traveler Jan Hasi≈°tejnsk√Ω on 23 September 1493, in his travel book, the account by the Glagolite priest Martinac in the Novi Vinodolski Breviary in 1493, and the account of the battle written in a letter to Pope Alexander VI by the Nin Bishop Juraj Divniƒá on 27 September 1493. In 1561, the battle of Krbava field was described by the chronicler Ivan Toma≈°iƒá in his Brief Chronicle of the Croatian Kingdom (Chronicon breve Regni Croatiae), and in 1696, Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá described it in Kronika aliti szpomen vszega szvieta vikov. The numbers for involved soldiers and casualties given in older historical sources are mostly exaggerated. Since news of the defeat spread quickly, the reports written immediately after the battle were made under the impression of the heavy loss.

At a referendum held in the following year, the Act failed to gain the necessary level of approval required by an amendment, and was never put into effect. Background Following Winnie Ewing's groundbreaking win for the Scottish National Party in the 1967 Hamilton by-election, the United Kingdom government responded to the growing support for Scottish independence by setting up the Royal Commission on the Constitution, better known as the Kilbrandon Commission (1969‚Äì1973). In response to the Royal Commission's report, James Callaghan's Labour government brought forward proposals to establish a Scottish Assembly. In November 1977 a Scotland Bill providing for the establishment of a Scottish Assembly was introduced; it received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1978. The proposed Scottish Assembly Had the Scotland Act 1978 entered force, it would have created a Scottish Assembly with very limited legislative powers. There would have been a Scottish Executive headed by a \\"First Secretary\\", taking over some of the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Two possible contenders for the post of First Secretary were the Reverend Geoff Shaw, leader of Strathclyde Regional Council, and Professor John P Mackintosh MP ‚Äì but both died in 1978. Assembly members would have been elected by the \\"first past the post\\" system. The Scottish Assembly would have had the power to introduce primary legislation, to be known as \\"Measures\\" (rather than Acts) within defined areas of competence. Meetings of the Scottish Assembly would have been held at the Old Royal High School in Regent Road, Edinburgh; the former school hall was adapted for use by the Scottish Assembly, including the installation of microphones and new olive green leather seating. Some other new offices would also have been created, such as a Comptroller and Auditor General for Scotland. Referendum and repeal The Scotland Act included a requirement for a \\"post-legislative\\" referendum to be held in Scotland to approve the Act's coming into force. During its passage through Parliament, an amendment introduced by George Cunningham (a Scot who represented an English seat) added a further requirement that the approval at the referendum be by 40% of Scotland's total registered electorate, rather than by a simple majority. The referendum was held on 1 March 1979. A total of 1,230,937 (51.6%) voted at the referendum in favour of an Assembly, a narrow majority of about 77,400 over those voting against. However, this total represented only 32.9% of the registered electorate as a whole. The Labour government accepted that the Act's requirements had not been met, and that devolution would therefore not be introduced for Scotland. Under the terms of the Act, it was then repealed by a Statutory Instrument to be approved by Parliament. The Scottish National Party subsequently voted against the government in a vote of no confidence which led to the resignation of the Callaghan government, and an election was called. The vote to approve the statutory instrument repealing the Act was not held until 20 June 1979, by which time a Conservative government had come to power under Margaret Thatcher. The Order-in-Council was subsequently made on 26 July 1979. Postscript In 1998 a new Scotland Act was passed, leading to the establishment of a Scottish Parliament. A key difference between the two Acts is that under the 1978 legislation a very limited number of specific powers would have been devolved to Scotland, whereas under the 1998 legislation it is the powers reserved to Westminster which are specifically limited; everything not mentioned in the 1998 Act is automatically the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.

The Respectful Prostitute () is a French play by Jean- Paul Sartre, written in 1946, which observes a woman, a prostitute, caught up in a racially tense period of American history. The audience understands that there has been an incident on a train with said woman involved, but also a black man on whom the blame is laid by the prejudiced law enforcers. What comes to the viewer's realisation is that a white man instigated an attack, but it is in the interests of the law to preserve the perception of the white person at the expense of the black \\"devil\\". The tale takes a brief look at the loss of freedom inside a cruel world, a subject that dominates Sartre's literary career. The play premiered in November 1946 at the Th√©√¢tre Antoine- Simone Berriau in Paris. When the play was produced in the United States, Sartre was accused of anti-Americanism.Steve Martinot, \\"Skin For Sale: Race and The Respectful Prostitute\\", in Jonathan Judaken (ed.), Race after Sartre: Antiracism, Africana Existentialism, Postcolonialism, State University of New York Press, 2008, p. 55.

Ward, Tommy L. Lott (eds), Philosophers on Race: Critical Essays, Blackwell, 2002, p. 222. The play was adapted in the film La Putain respectueuse (1952).

Found in Bodrum Castle, but possibly from the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. Orontobates (in Greek ·ΩàœÅoŒΩœÑoŒ≤Œ¨œÑŒ∑œÇ. Old Persian Aurandabad, lived 4th century BC) was a Persian, who married the daughter of Pixodarus, the usurping satrap of Caria, and was sent by the king of Persia to succeed him. On the approach of Alexander the Great of Macedon (334 BC) Orontobates and Memnon of Rhodes entrenched themselves in Halicarnassus. But at last, despairing of defending it, they set fire to the town, and under cover of the conflagration crossed over to Cos, whither they had previously removed their treasures. In addition to the island of Cos, Orontobates, retained control of the citadel at Salmacis, and the towns Myndus, Caunus, Thera and Callipolis together with Triopium. Next year, while at Soli, Cilicia, Alexander learnt that Orontobates had been defeated in a great battle by Ptolemy and Asander. It is natural to infer that the places which Orontobates held did not long hold out after his defeat. An officer of the name of Orontobates was present in the army of Darius III at the battle of Gaugamela (331 BC), being one of the commanders of the troops drawn from the shores of the Persian Gulf. Whether he was the same or a different person from the preceding, we have no means of knowing. We are not told that the latter was killed as well as defeated. It is likely that Alexander the Great knew Orontobates intimately as there was a princess between the two. In his youth Alexander wanted to marry Ada II, the daughter of Pixodarus but this was negated by his father. Incidentally Orontobates married a daughter of Pixodarus, who was probably the same as Ada II. Thus, the relation between the two may have been far more complex than what Justin or even Plutarch knew.

Early life Prior to entering politics, Dockrill was a member of the Nova Scotia Government Employee's Union and a receptionist at a Cape Breton health care facility. 1997 election Dockrill was nominated to run for the Canadian New Democratic Party in the federal election called for June 2, 1997. She was up against then-Health Minister David Dingwall, perceived as the most powerful Nova Scotian figure in the government of then-Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien. With the NDP having only won 5% of the vote in 1993, Dockrill, nominated after the election had already been called, was not taken seriously by Dingwall's Liberals or the NDP, who initially devoted few resources to her campaign. Dingwall, MP for the area since 1980, was seen as unable or unwilling to use his vast patronage powers to improve living conditions in his impoverished riding. Changes to laws governing unemployment insurance, restrictions on the fisheries, the slow destruction of the area's coal mining industry and problems with health care services all contributed to a growing sense that Dingwall was out of touch. Dockrill ran an aggressive campaign, assisted by resources directed to the riding by then Nova Scotia NDP Provincial Secretary Ron Cavalucci. Cavalucci sent his assistant to manage the campaign; he launched a series of ads accusing Dingwall of lying and implicating him in secret discussions to close the coal mines. Dingwall was seen to lose a CBC Radio debate with Dockrill and the Progressive Conservative candidate. On election night, Dockrill defeated Dingwall by more than 1,200 votes, capturing 41.30% of the vote. Member of Parliament She worked tirelessly on the issue of the coal industry, the last Cape Breton mine was closed soon after her defeat in the election of November 2000, when she lost in a landslide by Liberal Rodger Cuzner. She achieved brief fame for being the first MP to bring her newborn baby into the House of Commons. In 2004 Dockrill, who had returned to her previous position working in a health facility, ran for and lost the NDP nomination to newcomer Shirley Hartery, who went on to be defeated by Cuzner in the June election.

Ullesthorpe is noted for its historic background with a mill, disused railway station and traces of a medieval settlement evident on the edge of the village. Geography Located 10 miles north of Rugby, Ullesthorpe is within easy access of the M1, M69 and M6. Local amenities include a primary school, post office, village shop, butchers, doctors surgery, hairdressers, garden centre, congregational church, one pub and a golf course associated with the 'Ullesthorpe Court Hotel'. History Many prehistoric items have been located in and around Ullesthorpe, this includes flint tools found by the Lutterworth Archaeological Fieldwork Group. This indicates a settlement was located here during the prehistoric period. There is significant evidence that Romans came to Ullesthorpe in the 1st century AD because Roman coins, roof tiles and pottery have been recovered, as well as nearby Roman roads. After the fall of the Romans, settlers from the continent and Scandinavia began to move to Ullesthorpe. At certain times, the Saxons controlled the local area. However, a major influence came from the Danes. The name 'Ullesthorpe' derives from Old Scandinavian which means \\"the settlement of a man called Ulfr\\". Other villages near Ullesthorpe were also highly influenced by the Danes and therefore their names are derived from the Scandinavian language as well. 1945 Ordnance Survey of Ullesthorpe and the surrounding area. Parish In 1870-1872- John Marius Wilson's described Ullesthorpe as: \\"A hamlet in Claybrooke parish, Leicester; on the Rugby and Leicester railway, 3¬º miles NW of Lutterworth\\". Until the mid 19th century, Ullesthorpe was a minor settlement within the Ancient Parish of Claybrook. Other villages included Claybrooke Magna, Claybrooke Parva, and Wibtoft. These four villages formed the parish of St Peter's Church Claybrooke. However, deemed under the 1866 Act, many villages became their own civil parish. Although Ullesthorpe is still part of St Peter's Parish Church, Ullesthorpe now has its own civil parish where people are elected into Ullesthorpe Parish Council who form a local government unit and control finances within the local village. Ullesthorpe Railway station Ullesthorpe used to have a railway station which served the Midland Counties Railway. Passed by Parliament on 21 June 1836, Ullesthorpe railway station was opened on 1 July 1840, serving between Leicester and Rugby. Originally named Ullesthorpe, the railway station name has been changed on a number of occasions. On 1 May 1879, it was renamed from Ullesthorpe to Lutterworth, being changed to Ullesthorpe and Lutterworth on 1 August 1897. Eventually it was changed backed to its original name on 1 February 1930. It was renowned for earning the award for the best kept station and won the area award in 1953 with a variety of red, white and blue flower displays. However, on 30 December 1961, the railway station was closed as part of the closure of the Leicester to Rugby railway line. Even since the closure of the railway about 50 years ago, the disused railway line is still in existence. Ullesthorpe Mill In 1800, by subscription, a five-story tower mill was built. The original mill had two pairs of millstones, with an extra one being added in 1838. The main purpose of the mill was the milling of corn which was a main source of employment in the 19th century. Consequently, this led to a rapid increase in the number of people living in Ullesthorpe with the village population increasing from 494 in 1801 to 600 in 1821. However, in the late 1890s, production ceased and this led to the closure of the mill. After the closure of mill, the tower was preserved because it was listed as a Grade II building. Through funding from the National Lottery, Ullesthorpe Preservation Trust was set up. Ullesthorpe Preservation Trust decided to transform the disused mill into a small museum with displays and study facilities. Over the last three years, considerable effort has been put in place to open the mill up to the public, which has brought much interest to the area despite the limited work. Through the work of Ullesthorpe Preservation trust, the mill is open to the public for several weekends throughout the year. It has proved to be a valuable learning resource, enabling people to learn more about the history of Ullesthorpe, which beforehand lacked any historic buildings or museums. Demographics Population Total Population of Ullesthorpe Civil Parish, Leicestershire, as reported by Neighbourhood Statistics and Vision of Britain from 1871 to 2011. Prior to the release of accurate census records, a population count counted 494 people living in Ullesthorpe in 1801. With the opening of the mill in 1800, this led to a rapid increase in the number of people living within the local area because of the employment opportunities. This led to a population increase of 600 in 1821. However, after the close of the mills in the late 1890s, population figures fell again. When accurate census records were introduced in 1881, it is evident from the graph, that there was a fluctuation in population figures. In 1881, the population was recorded as 523. However, by 1911, the population count had sharply declined to 312, but in recent years, this has been on the increase. The population, based on the 2011 census, indicates 903 people currently live in Ullesthorpe. Occupation structure Occupation structure of males and females in Ullesthorpe in 1881. The chart to the right indicates what occupation males and females from Ullesthorpe had in 1881. The chart evidently indicates that the predominant male job was within the agriculture sector with 47 people (35%). On the other hand, the predominant role for women was within the domestic office/services with 32 people (27%). However, we cannot be certain with this percentage because 62 women's occupations were unknown in the 1881 census. In comparison, the 2011 census data reveals that agriculture and domestic roles are on the decline. The predominant roles within the male sector were professionals and technicians (34.9%), skilled tradesmen (21.7%) and managers and senior officers (18.8%). For women, the main roles were professionals (20.4%) and administrative/secretarial occupations (20.4%). Evidently, in the last 120 years, occupations for both males and females have changed dramatically.

It was directed by Jacques Tourneur (his final film) and starred Vincent Price, Tab Hunter, Susan Hart and David Tomlinson. The plot concerns the discovery of a lost city beneath the sea off the coast of Cornwall. Price is the captain overseeing a group of sailors who have lived there for more than a century where the peculiar mix of gases has allowed them to extend their lifespan. The film was a period fantasy in the manner begun with Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954). The film attempted to capitalize on the series of Edgar Allan Poe films that had been made by Roger Corman, starring Price. To this extent the film took the title of a Poe poem, \\"The City in the Sea\\", and attempted to exploit the Poe films' trend, even though the plot is only loosely based on the poem, with a recitation of the poem at the beginning of the film and a brief reprise at the end. Plot Around the turn of the century, American mining engineer Ben Harris is working on the Cornish coast in England when he finds a body washed up on the beach. Ben makes inquiries at the nearby hotel. While talking to the hotelier's daughter, fellow American Jill Tregellis, and an eccentric artist, Harold Tufnell-Jones, a mysterious intruder appears but disappears. Later that night Jill is kidnapped by gill men. Ben, Harold and Harold's chicken follow the trail through a secret door into the caves under the house where they are sucked into a pool. They emerge in a cavernous city on the ocean floor. The city was built by a race of ancients who survive only as a breed of gill men. The city is now inhabited by a group of smugglers led by the cruel and tyrannical Captain who hid down there in 1803 and due to the strange mixture of oxygen have not aged in over a century. However, the volcano that powers the city has become unstable. The Captain now imprisons them until Ben can come up with a means of maintaining it. Dan, one of the Captain's men who wishes to leave, offers to help the two escape, provided they use their influence to secure him a full pardon for his past crimes of smuggling. The Captain finds out and reveals that because of the gas they've breathed for so long, exposure to sunlight would cause them to age rapidly and die. Dan is then sent to the surface as a means of execution while Ben and Harold are granted an audience with Jill. Whereupon they meet Rev. Jonathan Ives, who had vanished several decades ago from the surface. The Captain is shown to be under the delusion that Jill is his deceased wife Beatrice, who he believes has returned to him. Realising that Ben and Harold are untrustworthy, the Captain decides to allow the Gill Men to sacrifice the two as a means to appease the volcano's wrath. While they await this, Jill and Ives free them and Ives instructs them all on how to escape the city. The three make it to the airlock and trek across the ocean floor to a cave, containing a tunnel that leads to the surface. The Captain and his men pursue them there, but frequent volcanic eruptions cause rockfalls that bury him and his men. Ben and his friends decide to return to the sea and attempt to reach shore on foot. The Captain meanwhile digs himself free and follows the tunnel to the surface, where the sunlight does indeed age him to death. Ben and the rest make it to shore and watch as the volcano erupts, finally destroying the city.

The Hong Kong Bar Association is the equivalent association for barristers in Hong Kong. The Law Society is currently headed by President Melissa K. Pang (ÂΩ≠ÈüªÂÉñ) and is located on the third floor of Wing On House in Central.  History  It was formed on 8 July 1907 as a company limited by guarantee, and was then known as The Incorporated Law Society of Hong Kong. The present name was adopted in 1969. In 2014, the society underwent its first ever motion of no confidence in its president over his declared support for the white paper published by the PRC on the city's autonomy in which patriotism was a prerequisite for the territory's judges. Ambrose Lam's declaration appeared to be at odds with sentiment of its members, a thousand of whom marched in response to the white paper.http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/hk-legal-body-votes- to/1314618.html Over 100 petitioners objected to Lam's politicisation of the Law Society, requesting that Lam withdraw his comments and reassert support for judicial independence. The tabler of the no confidence vote had expected Lam to be able to call on a large reservoir of proxy votes in his defence. At a meeting called for 14 August 2014, Lam suffered a surprising defeat in the non-binding vote calling for him to resign. The motion was carried by 2,392 votes to 1,478, with almost half its members voting in person or by proxy. There had been complaints of members receiving external pressure from Chinese companies, the central government Liaison Office, and members of the CPPCC National Committee. Lam resigned on 19 August 2014, with neither an apology nor a retraction.  Structure  The society is divided into two bodies: * The Council ‚Äì the governing body of the society and consists of 20 members with 2 vice-presidents and 1 president. * The Secretariat ‚Äì the body responsible for the standing committees within the society and has around 100 staff.  Profile of the profession  As of 30 September 2018, the Law Society regulates 9,708 solicitors in Hong Kong with a current practising certificate. = Structure of the profession = * 7,167 solicitors were in private practice in 908 firms. * Of these firms: ** 47% were sole practitioners. Of all the sole practitioners, 44% did not employ any other legally qualified persons. ** 196 firms employed a total of 934 trainee solicitors. * 2,805 were in partnerships or were sole practitioners. * 4,362 solicitors are assistant solicitors or consultants in firms. * 2,032 solicitors worked with private businesses (in-house) or in government (Department of Justice, etc.). = Foreign lawyers = Foreign lawyers in Hong Kong come from 33 jurisdictions (at 30 September 2018) * 433 foreign lawyers employed by 85 foreign firms. * 1,100 foreign lawyers employed in local law firms. = Gender = * Of all practising solicitors, 54% were men and 46% were women. * However, of the 934 trainee solicitors, 40% were men and 60% were women. = Ethnicity = * 83% of practising solicitors were ethnic Chinese.

He was born in Venice, Italy, and was in the service of Karl Philip Emanuel of Pfalz in Mannheim, Germany before being called to Denmark in 1739 to work for the royal court of King Christian VI. One of the court‚Äôs biggest projects at the time was the building and decoration of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen 1733-1745, for which Miani painted a large plafond or ceiling decoration with religious theme. The work was entitled \\"Uretf√¶rdighedens og lasternes flugt for den retf√¶rdige Guds √•syn\\" (\\"The Flight of Injustice and Vices at the Sight of the Just God\\"), and was painted 1739-1740. An oil painting of the same theme is in the collection of the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst). He also painted two large figure paintings from the story of Moses, as well as a painting of then Crown Prince Frederik V on horseback. These were all lost in the Christiansborg fire of 1794. An engraving based on the portrait of Frederik V still exists. In 1740 he and French sculptor, Louis August le Clerc, took over the leadership of the newly formed Christian VI‚Äôs Art Academy, The Drawing and Painting Academy (Tegne- og maleriakademiet), which had been left without a leader when Hendrick Krock died in 1738, This academy would eventually become the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) in the mid-1750s. Miani and le Clerc were both named professors at the Academy, while painter Marcus Cardes and medallionist Georg Wahl were freehand drawing teachers (informatorer). On 1 February 1740 the Academy opened its doors to all interested students, not only artists, but also art lovers and such professionals and handworkers for whom drawing could be an asset. A Royal Resolution of 24 August 1740 provided a measly subsidy of 500 Rdl from the King‚Äôs discretionary funds, and conditions at the school were miserable. For some period of time starting in 1744 the model school, which had only 10-16 students, took place at the Widow Lyders's house on Gammelstrand where Miani was lodging. Among Miani's students were Johannes Wiedewelt and Peter Cramer. Miani left Denmark in 1745-1746 with a royal gift (severance pay), and returned to Italy. le Clerc continued alone in the role of Academy director after Miani's departure, and until architect Nicolai Eigtved took full control over the Academy.

It is a sociological concept developed by several classical and contemporary theorists.Esp., Emile Durkheim, 1951, 1984; Erich Fromm, 1941, 1955; Karl Marx, 1846, 1867; Georg Simmel, 1950, 1971; Melvin Seeman, 1959; Kalekin- Fishman, 1998, and Robert Ankony, 1999. The concept has many discipline- specific uses, and can refer both to a personal psychological state (subjectively) and to a type of social relationship (objectively). History The term alienation has been used over the ages with varied and sometimes contradictory meanings. In ancient history it could mean a metaphysical sense of achieving a higher state of contemplation, ecstasy or union‚Äîbecoming alienated from a limited existence in the world, in a positive sense. Examples of this usage have been traced to neoplatonic philosophers such as Plotinus (in the Greek alloiosis). There have also long been religious concepts of being separated or cut off from God and the faithful, alienated in a negative sense. The New Testament mentions the term apallotrioomai in Greek‚Äî\\"being alienated from\\". Ideas of estrangement from a Golden Age, or due to a fall of man, or approximate equivalents in differing cultures or religions, have also been described as concepts of alienation. A double positive and negative sense of alienation is broadly shown in the spiritual beliefs referred to as Gnosticism. Alienation has also had a particular legal-political meaning since at least Ancient Roman times, where to alienate property (alienato) is to transfer ownership of it to someone else. The term alienation itself comes from the Latin alienus which meant 'of another place or person', which in turn came from alius, meaning \\"other\\" or \\"another\\". An alienus in ancient Roman times could refer to someone else's slave. Another usage of the term in Ancient Greco-Roman times was by physicians referring to disturbed, difficult or abnormal states of mind, generally attributed to imbalanced physiology. In Latin alienatio mentis (mental alienation), this usage has been dated to Asclepiades.E Regis (1895) A practical manual of mental medicine 2nd ed., thoroughly rev. and largely rewritten. by E. R√©gis; with a preface by M. Benjamin Ball; authorized translation by H.M. Bannister; with introduction by the author. Published 1895 by Blakiston in Philadelphia. Originally bound and printed by 'the insane' of Utica asylum Once translations of such works had resurfaced in the West in the 17th century, physicians again began using the term, which is typically attributed to Felix Platter. In medieval times, a relationship between alienation and social order has been described, mediated in part by mysticism and monasticism. The Crusades and witch-hunts have been described as forms of mass alienation.Gerhart B. Ladner (1967), \\"Homo Viator: Mediaeval Ideas on Alienation and Order,\\" Speculum, Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 233‚Äì259 = 17th century = In the 17th century, Hugo Grotius put forward the concept that everyone has 'sovereign authority' over themselves but that they could alienate that natural right to the common good, an early social contract theory. In the 18th century, Hutcheson introduced a distinction between alienable and unalienable rights in the legal sense of the term. Rousseau published influential works on the same theme, and is also seen as having popularized a more psychological-social concept relating to alienation from a state of nature due to the expansion of civil society or the nation state. In the same century a law of alienation of affection was introduced for men to seek compensation from other men accused of taking away 'their' woman. In the history of literature, the German Romantics appear to be the first group of writers and poets in whose work the concept of alienation is regularly found.Rado Pribic (2008) Alienation, Irony, and German Romanticism, Lafayette College, Easton, PA Around the start of the 19th century, Hegel popularized a Christian (Lutheran) and Idealist philosophy of alienation.Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998): \\"Alienation\\". He used German terms in partially different senses, referring to a psychological state and an objective process, and in general posited that the self was an historical and social creation, which becomes alienated from itself via a perceived objective world, but can become de-alienated again when that world is seen as just another aspect of the self-consciousness, which may be achieved by self-sacrifice to the common good. Around the same time, Pinel was popularizing a new understanding of mental alienation, particularly through his 'medical-philosophical treatise'. He argued that people could be disturbed (alienated) by emotional states and social conditions, without necessarily having lost (become alienated from) their reason, as had generally been assumed. Hegel praised Pinel for his 'moral treatment' approach, and developed related theories.Dora B. Weiner Nine: Mind and Body in the Clinic in Rousseau, G. S., editor The Languages of Psyche: Mind and Body in Enlightenment Thought. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990.Daniel Berthold-Bond, Hegel's theory of madness, SUNY Press, 1995 Nevertheless, as Foucault would later write, \\"... in an obscure, shared origin, the 'alienation' of physicians and the 'alienation' of philosophers started to take shape‚Äîtwo configurations in which man in any case corrupts his truth, but between which, after Hegel, the nineteenth century stopped seeing any trace of resemblance.\\"Foucault, Michel. Madness and Civilization, 1964/2001, p. 209. Also known (unabridged) as History of Madness 1961/2006, p. 372. Routledge. Two camps formed following Hegel, the 'young' or 'left' Hegelians who developed his philosophy to support innovations in politics or religion, and the 'old' or 'right' Hegelians who took his philosophy in a politically and religiously conservative direction. The former camp has had a more lasting influence and, among them, Feuerbach differed from Hegel in arguing that worship of God is itself a form of alienation, because it projects human qualities on to an external idea, rather than realising them as part of the self. =Marx= Marx was initially in the Young Hegelian camp and, like Feuerbach, rejected the spiritual basis, and adapted Hegel's dialectic model to a theory of (historical) materialism. Marx's theory of alienation is articulated most clearly in the Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 and The German Ideology (1846). The 'young' Marx wrote more often and directly of alienation than the 'mature' Marx, which some regard as an ideological break while others maintain that the concept remained central. There is generally held to be a transition from a philosophical-anthropological (Marxist humanism) concept (e.g. internal alienation from the self) to a structural-historical interpretation (e.g. external alienation by appropriation of labor), accompanied by a change in terminology from alienation to exploitation to commodity fetishism and reification.Fr√©d√©ric Vandenberghe A Philosophical History of German Sociology Chapter One: Karl Marx: critique of the triple inversion of subject and objects: alienation, exploitation, and commodity fetishism. 2009, translated from the French Marx's concepts of alienation have been classed into four types by Kostas Axelos: economic and social alienation, political alienation, human alienation, and ideological alienation.(Axelos, 1976) In the concept's most prominent use, it refers to the economic and social alienation aspect in which workers are disconnected from what they produce and why they produce. Marx believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Essentially, there is an \\"exploitation of men by men\\" where the division of labor creates an economic hierarchy (Axelos, 1976: 58). His theory of alienation was based upon his observation that in emerging industrial production under capitalism, workers inevitably lose control of their lives and selves by not having any control of their work. Workers never become autonomous, self-realized human beings in any significant sense, except in the way the bourgeoisie wants the worker to be realized. His theory relies on Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity (1841), which argues that the idea of God has alienated the characteristics of the human being. Stirner would take the analysis further in The Ego and Its Own (1844), declaring that even 'humanity' is an alienating ideal for the individual, to which Marx and Engels responded in The German Ideology (1845). Alienation in capitalist societies occurs because in work each contributes to the common wealth but they can only express this fundamentally social aspect of individuality through a production system that is not publicly social but privately owned, for which each individual functions as an instrument, not as a social being. Kostas Axelos summarizes that for Marx, in capitalism \\"work renders man an alien to himself and to his own products.\\" \\"The malaise of this alienation from the self means that the worker does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy....The worker only feels himself outside his work, and in his work he feels outside himself....Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, it is avoided like the plague.\\".Marx-Engels, in Zeitin, 1968:87Purdue, William D., Sociological Theory: Explanation, Paradigm, and Ideology, Mayfield Publishing Co., Palo Alto, CA, 1986:325 Marx also wrote, in a curtailed manner, that capitalist owners also experience alienation, through benefiting from the economic machine by endlessly competing, exploiting others and maintaining mass alienation in society.Bertell Ollman (1976) # # Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society Chapter 23: The Capitalist's Alienation. Cambridge U.P., 1971; 2nd ed., 1976 The idea of Political Alienation refers to the idea that \\"politics is the form that organizes the productive forces of the economy\\" in a way that is alienating because it \\"distorts the logic of economic development\\".(Axelos, 1976: 87) In Human Alienation, individuals become estranged to themselves in the quest to stay alive, where \\"they lose their true existence in the struggle for subsistence\\" (Axelos, 1976: 111). Marx focuses on two aspects of human nature which he calls \\"historical conditions.\\" The first aspect refers to the necessity of food, clothes, shelter, and more. Secondly, Marx believes that after satisfying these basic needs people have the tendency to develop more \\"needs\\" or desires that they will work towards satisfying, hence, humans become stuck in a cycle of never ending wants which makes them strangers to each other.(Axelos, 1976: 113) When referring to ideological alienation, Axelos proposes that Marx believes that all religions divert people away from \\"their true happiness\\" and instead turn them towards \\"illusory happiness\\".(Axelos, 1976: 161-162) There is a commonly noted problem of translation in grappling with ideas of alienation derived from German-language philosophical texts: the word alienation, and similar words such as estrangement, are often used interchangeably to translate two distinct German words, Entfremdung and Ent√§u√üerung. The former means specifically interpersonal estrangement, while the latter can have a broader and more active meaning that might refer also to externalization, relinquishment, or sale (alienation) of property. In general, and contrary to his predecessors, Marx may have used the terms interchangeably, though he also wrote \\"Entfremdung...constitutes the real interest of this Ent√§u√üerung.\\"Chris Arthur (1986), The Dialectics of Labor (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), p. 132. =Late 1800s to 1900s= Many sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were concerned about alienating effects of modernization. German sociologists Georg Simmel and Ferdinand T√∂nnies wrote critical works on individualization and urbanization. Simmel's The Philosophy of Money describes how relationships become more and more mediated by money. T√∂nnies' Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft (Community and Society) is about the loss of primary relationships such as familial bonds in favour of goal-oriented, secondary relationships. This idea of alienation can be observed in some other contexts, although the term may not be as frequently used. In the context of an individual's relationships within society, alienation can mean the unresponsiveness of society as a whole to the individuality of each member of the society. When collective decisions are made, it is usually impossible for the unique needs of each person to be taken into account. The American sociologist C. Wright Mills conducted a major study of alienation in modern society with White Collar in 1951, describing how modern consumption- capitalism has shaped a society where you have to sell your personality in addition to your work. Melvin Seeman was part of a surge in alienation research during the mid-20th century when he published his paper, \\"On the Meaning of Alienation\\", in 1959 (Senekal, 2010b: 7‚Äì8). Seeman used the insights of Marx, Emile Durkheim and others to construct what is often considered a model to recognize the five prominent features of alienation: powerlessness, meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation and self-estrangement (Seeman, 1959).Ankony, Robert C., \\"The Impact of Perceived Alienation on Police Officer's Sense of Mastery and Subsequent Motivation for Proactive Enforcement,\\" Policing: An International Journal of Police Strategies and Management, vol. 22, no.2 (1999): 120-32. Seeman later added a sixth element (cultural estrangement), although this element does not feature prominently in later discussions of his work. In a broader philosophical context, especially in existentialism and phenomenology, alienation describes the inadequacy of the human being (or the mind) in relation to the world. The human mind (as the subject who perceives) sees the world as an object of perception, and is distanced from the world, rather than living within it. This line of thought is generally traced to the works of S√∏ren Kierkegaard in the 19th century, who, from a Christian viewpoint, saw alienation as separation from God, and also examined the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices. Many 20th-century philosophers (both theistic and atheistic) and theologians were influenced by Kierkegaard's notions of angst, despair and the importance of the individual. Martin Heidegger's concepts of anxiety (angst) and mortality drew from Kierkegaard; he is indebted to the way Kierkegaard lays out the importance of our subjective relation to truth, our existence in the face of death, the temporality of existence and the importance of passionately affirming one's being-in-the-world. Jean-Paul Sartre described the \\"thing-in-itself\\" which is infinite and overflowing, and claimed that any attempt to describe or understand the thing-in-itself is \\"reflective consciousness\\". Since there is no way for the reflective consciousness to subsume the pre-reflective, Sartre argued that all reflection is fated to a form of anxiety (i.e. the human condition). As well, Sartre argued that when a person tries to gain knowledge of the \\"Other\\" (meaning beings or objects that are not the self), their self-consciousness has a \\"masochistic desire\\" to be limited. This is expressed metaphorically in the line from the play No Exit, \\"Hell is other people\\". In the theory of psychoanalysis developed around the start of the 20th century, Sigmund Freud did not explicitly address the concept of alienation, but other analysts subsequently have. It is a theory of divisions and conflicts between the conscious and unconscious mind, between different parts of a hypothetical psychic apparatus, and between the self and civilization. It postulates defense mechanisms, including splitting, in both normal and disturbed functioning. The concept of repression has been described as having functionally equivalent effects as the idea of false consciousness associated with Marxist theory.Felix Geyer (2001) Alienation, Sociology of in International Encyclopedia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paul Baltes and Neil Smelser, Eds., London: Elsevier A form of Western Marxism developed during the century, which included influential analyses of false consciousness by Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs. Critics of bureaucracy and the Protestant Ethic also drew on the works of Max Weber. Figures associated with critical theory, in particular with the Frankfurt School, such as Theodor Adorno and Erich Fromm, also developed theories of alienation, drawing on neo-Marxist ideas as well as other influences including neo-Freudian and sociological theories. One approach applies Marxist theories of commodification to the cultural, educational and party-political spheres. Links are drawn between socioeconomic structures, psychological states of alienation, and personal human relationships.Rafael D. Pangilinan (2009) Against Alienation: The Emancipative Potential of Critical Pedagogy in Fromm Kritike, Vol3, No2 In the 1960s the revolutionary group Situationist International came to some prominence, staging 'situations' intended to highlight an alternative way of life to advanced capitalism, the latter conceptualized as a diffuse 'spectacle', a fake reality masking a degradation of human life. The Theory of Communicative Action associated with J√ºrgen Habermas emphasizes the essential role of language in public life, suggesting that alienation stems from the distortion of reasoned moral debate by the strategic dominance of market forces and state power. This critical program can be contrasted with traditions that attempt to extract problems of alienation from the broader socioeconomic context, or which at least accept the broader context on its own terms, and which often attribute problems to individual abnormality or failures to adjust.Dahms, H. \\"Does Alienation have a Future? Recapturing the Core of Critical Theory.\\" In Trauma, Promise, and the Millennium: The Evolution of Alienation. ed. L. Langman and D.K. Fishman. Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. After the boom in alienation research that characterized the 1950s and 1960s, interest in alienation research subsided (Geyer, 1996: xii), although in sociology it was maintained by the Research Committee on Alienation of the International Sociological Association (ISA). In the 1990s, there was again an upsurge of interest in alienation prompted by the fall of the Soviet Union, globalization, the information explosion, increasing awareness of ethnic conflicts, and post-modernism (see Geyer, 1996). Geyer believes the growing complexity of the contemporary world and post-modernism prompted a reinterpretation of alienation that suits the contemporary living environment. In late 20th and early 21st century sociology, it has been particularly the works of Felix Geyer, Lauren Langman and Devorah Kalekin-Fishman that address the issue of alienation in the contemporary western world. Powerlessness Alienation in the sense of a lack of power has been technically defined by Seeman as \\"the expectancy or probability held by the individual that his own behaviour cannot determine the occurrence of the outcomes, or reinforcements, he seeks.\\" Seeman argues that this is \\"the notion of alienation as it originated in the Marxian view of the worker's condition in capitalist society: the worker is alienated to the extent that the prerogative and means of decision are expropriated by the ruling entrepreneurs\\".(Seeman, 1959: 784) More succinctly, Kalekin-Fishman (1996: 97) says, \\"A person suffers from alienation in the form of 'powerlessness' when she is conscious of the gap between what she would like to do and what she feels capable of doing\\". In discussing powerlessness, Seeman also incorporated the insights of the psychologist Julian Rotter. Rotter distinguishes between internal control and external locus of control, which means \\"differences (among persons or situations) in the degree to which success or failure is attributable to external factors (e.g. luck, chance, or powerful others), as against success or failure that is seen as the outcome of one's personal skills or characteristics\\".(Seeman, 1966: 355) Powerlessness, therefore, is the perception that the individual does not have the means to achieve his goals. More recently, GeyerGeyer (1996: xxiii) remarks that \\"a new type of powerlessness has emerged, where the core problem is no longer being unfree but rather being unable to select from among an overchoice of alternatives for action, whose consequences one often cannot even fathom\\". Geyer adapts cybernetics to alienation theory, and writes (1996: xxiv) that powerlessness is the result of delayed feedback: \\"The more complex one's environment, the later one is confronted with the latent, and often unintended, consequences of one's actions. Consequently, in view of this causality-obscuring time lag, both the 'rewards' and 'punishments' for one's actions increasingly tend to be viewed as random, often with apathy and alienation as a result\\". Meaninglessness A sense of meaning has been defined by Seeman as \\"the individual's sense of understanding events in which he is engaged\\".(Seeman, 1959: 786) Seeman (1959: 786) writes that meaninglessness \\"is characterized by a low expectancy that satisfactory predictions about the future outcomes of behaviour can be made.\\" Whereas powerlessness refers to the sensed ability to control outcomes, this refers to the sensed ability to predict outcomes. In this respect, meaninglessness is closely tied to powerlessness; Seeman (Ibid.) argues, \\"the view that one lives in an intelligible world might be a prerequisite to expectancies for control; and the unintelligibility of complex affairs is presumably conducive to the development of high expectancies for external control (that is, high powerlessness)\\". Geyer (1996: xxiii) believes meaninglessness should be reinterpreted for postmodern times: \\"With the accelerating throughput of information [...] meaningless is not a matter anymore of whether one can assign meaning to incoming information, but of whether one can develop adequate new scanning mechanisms to gather the goal- relevant information one needs, as well as more efficient selection procedures to prevent being overburdened by the information one does not need, but is bombarded with on a regular basis.\\" \\"Information overload\\" or the so-called \\"data tsunami\\" are well-known information problems confronting contemporary man, and Geyer thus argues that meaninglessness is turned on its head. Normlessness Normlessness (or what Durkheim referred to as anomie) \\"denotes the situation in which the social norms regulating individual conduct have broken down or are no longer effective as rules for behaviour\\".(Seeman, 1959: 787) This aspect refers to the inability to identify with the dominant values of society or rather, with what are perceived to be the dominant values of society. Seeman (1959: 788) adds that this aspect can manifest in a particularly negative manner, \\"The anomic situation [...] may be defined as one in which there is a high expectancy that socially unapproved behaviours are required to achieve given goals\\". This negative manifestation is dealt with in detail by Catherine Ross and John Mirowski in a series of publications on mistrust, powerlessness, normlessness and crime. Neal & Collas (2000: 122) write, \\"Normlessness derives partly from conditions of complexity and conflict in which individuals become unclear about the composition and enforcement of social norms. Sudden and abrupt changes occur in life conditions, and the norms that usually operate may no longer seem adequate as guidelines for conduct\\". This is a particular issue after the fall of the Soviet Union, mass migrations from developing to developed countries, and the general sense of disillusionment that characterized the 1990s (Senekal, 2011). Traditional values that had already been questioned (especially during the 1960s) were met with further scepticism in the 1990s, resulting in a situation where individuals rely more often on their own judgement than on institutions of authority: \\"The individual not only has become more independent of the churches, but from other social institutions as well. The individual can make more personal choices in far more life situations than before\\" (Halman, 1998: 100). These choices are not necessarily \\"negative\\": Halman's study found that Europeans remain relatively conservative morally, even though the authority of the Church and other institutions has eroded. Relationships One concept used in regard to specific relationships is that of parental alienation, where a child is distanced from and expresses a general dislike for one of their parents (who may have divorced or separated). The term is not applied where there is child abuse. The parental alienation might be due to specific influences from either parent or could result from the social dynamics of the family as a whole. It can also be understood in terms of attachment, the social and emotional process of bonding between child and caregiver. Adoptees can feel alienated from both adoptive parents and birth parents.Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness Familial estrangement between parents and adult children \\"is attributed to a number of biological, psychological, social, and structural factors affecting the family, including attachment disorders, incompatible values and beliefs, unfulfilled expectations, critical life events and transitions, parental alienation, and ineffective communication patterns.\\" The degree of alienation has been positively correlated with decreased emotional functioning in the parent who feels a loss of identity and stigma.Agllias, Kylie. (Sep 2013). Family Estrangement. Encyclopedia of Social Work. Subject: Couples and Families, Aging and Older Adults, Children and Adolescents.DOI: 10.1093/acrefore/9780199975839.013.919McKnight, A. S. (2003). The impact of cutoff in families raising adolescents. In P. Titelman (Ed.), Emotional cutoff: Bowen family systems theory perspectives (pp. 273‚Äì284). New York, NY: Haworth Clinical Practice Press. Attachment relationships in adults can also involve feelings of alienation.AAMFT Consumer Update Indeed, emotional alienation is said to be a common way of life for many, whether it is experienced as overwhelming, or is not admitted to in the midst of a socioeconomic race, or contributes to seemingly unrelated problems. Social isolation Social isolation refers to \\"The feeling of being segregated from one's community\\".(Kalekin-Fishman, 1996: 97) Neal and Collas (2000: 114) emphasize the centrality of social isolation in the modern world: \\"While social isolation is typically experienced as a form of personal stress, its sources are deeply embedded in the social organization of the modern world. With increased isolation and atomization, much of our daily interactions are with those who are strangers to us and with whom we lack any ongoing social relationships.\\" Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, migrants from Eastern Europe and the developing countries have flocked to developed countries in search of a better living standard. This has led to entire communities becoming uprooted: no longer fully part of their homelands, but neither integrated into their adopted communities. Diaspora literature depicts the plights of these migrants, such as Hafid Bouazza in Paravion. Senekal (2010b: 41) argues, \\"Low-income communities or religious minorities may feel separated from mainstream society, leading to backlashes such as the civil unrest that occurred in French cities in October 2005. The fact that the riots subsequently spread to Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Greece, and Switzerland, illustrates that not only did these communities feel segregated from mainstream society, but also that they found a community in their isolation; they regarded themselves as kindred spirits\\". Political alienation One manifestation of the above dimensions of alienation can be a feeling of estrangement from, and a lack of engagement in, the political system. Such political alienation could result from not identifying with any particular political party or message, and could result in revolution, reforming behavior, or abstention from the political process, possibly due to voter apathy.David C. Schwartz Political Alienation and Political Behavior Transaction Publishers, 30 Apr 2007 A similar concept is policy alienation, where workers experience a state of psychological disconnection from a policy programme being implemented. Self-estrangement Self-estrangement is an elusive concept in sociology, as recognized by Seeman (1959), although he included it as an aspect in his model of alienation. Some, with Marx, consider self-estrangement to be the end result and thus the heart of social alienation. Self-estrangement can be defined as \\"the psychological state of denying one's own interests ‚Äì of seeking out extrinsically satisfying, rather than intrinsically satisfying, activities...\\". It could be characterized as a feeling of having become a stranger to oneself, or to some parts of oneself, or alternatively as a problem of self-knowledge, or authenticity. Seeman (1959) recognized the problems inherent in defining the \\"self\\", while post-modernism in particular has questioned the very possibility of pin-pointing what precisely \\"self\\" constitutes. Gergen (1996: 125) argues that: \\"the traditional view of self versus society is deeply problematic and should be replaced by a conception of the self as always already immersed in relatedness. On this account, the individual's lament of 'not belonging' is partially a by-product of traditional discourses themselves\\". If the self is relationally constituted, does it make sense to speak of \\"self-estrangement\\" rather than \\"social isolation\\"? Costas and Fleming (2009: 354) suggest that although the concept of self-estrangement \\"has not weathered postmodern criticisms of essentialism and economic determinism well\\", the concept still has value if a Lacanian reading of the self is adopted. This can be seen as part of a wider debate on the concept of self between humanism and antihumanism, structuralism and post-structuralism, or nature and nurture. Mental disturbance Until early in the 20th century, psychological problems were referred to in psychiatry as states of mental alienation, implying that a person had become separated from themselves, their reason or the world. From the 1960s alienation was again considered in regard to clinical states of disturbance, typically using a broad concept of a 'schizoid' ('splitting') process taken from psychoanalytic theory. The splitting was said to occur within regular child development and in everyday life, as well as in more extreme or dysfunctional form in conditions such as schizoid personality and schizophrenia. Varied concepts of alienation and self-estrangement were used to link internal schizoid states with observable symptoms and with external socioeconomic divisions, without necessarily explaining or evidencing underlying causation. R. D. Laing was particularly influential in arguing that dysfunctional families and socioeconomic oppression caused states of alienation and ontological insecurity in people, which could be considered adaptations but which were diagnosed as disorders by mainstream psychiatry and society.(Laing,[1967] 1959).Johnson, Frank (1975) Psychological Alienation: Isolation and Self-Estrangement Psychoanalytic Review 62:3 Pg 369. Reprinted from Alienation: Concept, Term, and Meanings, 1973. The specific theories associated with Laing and others at that time are not widely accepted, but work from other theoretical perspectives sometimes addresses the same theme. In a related vein, for Ian Parker, psychology normalizes conditions of social alienation. While it could help groups of individuals emancipate themselves, it serves the role of reproducing existing conditions.(Parker, 2007). This view can be seen as part of a broader tradition sometimes referred to as critical psychology or liberation psychology, which emphasizes that an individual is enmeshed within a social-political framework, and so therefore are psychological problems. Similarly, some psychoanalysts suggest that while psychoanalysis emphasizes environmental causes and reactions, it also attributes the problems of individuals to internal conflicts stemming from early psychosocial development, effectively divorcing them from the wider ongoing context.Lynne Layton, Nancy Caro Hollander, Susan Gutwill (Eds) (2006) Psychoanalysis, class and politics: encounters in the clinical setting Introduction; Pg 47 Slavoj Zizek (drawing on Herbert Marcuse, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis) argues that in today's capitalist society, the individual is estranged from their self through the repressive injunction to \\"enjoy!\\" Such an injunction does not allow room for the recognition of alienation and, indeed, could itself be seen as an expression of alienation.(Zizek, 1994). Frantz Fanon, an early writer on postcolonialism, studied the conditions of objectification and violent oppression (lack of autonomy) believed to have led to mental disorders among the colonized in the Third World (in particular Africans) (Fanon, ([2004] 1961). A process of 'malignant alienation' has been observed in regard to some psychiatric patients, especially in forensic units and for individuals labeled 'difficult' or who aren't liked by at least some staff, which involves a breakdown of the therapeutic relationship between staff and patients, and which may end in the suicide of the patient.Mary Whittle Chapter 7: Malignant Alienation. In Gwen Adshead, Caroline Jacob Personality disorder: the definitive reader 2008 Individuals with long-term mental disorders, which may have originally stemmed from social alienation, can experience particular social and existential alienation within their communities due to other people's and potentially their own negative attitudes towards themselves and 'odd' behavior. Disability Differences between persons with disabilities and individuals in relative abilities, or perceived abilities, can be a cause of alienation. One study, \\"Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness\\",Foster, S. (1989), Social Alienation and Peer Identification: A Study of the Social Construction of Deafness, Human Organization, Volume 48, Number 3, pp. 226‚Äì235 found that among deaf adults one theme emerged consistently across all categories of life experience: social rejection by, and alienation from, the larger hearing community. Only when the respondents described interactions with deaf people did the theme of isolation give way to comments about participation and meaningful interaction. This appeared to be related to specific needs, for example for real conversation, for information, the opportunity to develop close friendships and a sense of family. It was suggested that the social meaning of deafness is established by interaction between deaf and hearing people, sometimes resulting in marginalization of the deaf, which is sometimes challenged. It has also led to the creation of alternatives and the deaf community is described as one such alternative. Physicians and nurses often deal with people who are temporarily or permanently alienated from communities, which could be a result or a cause of medical conditions and suffering, and it has been suggested that therefore attention should be paid to learning from experiences of the special pain that alienation can bring.Janice L. Willms Lingua Medica: Alienation and Imagination: The Literature of Exclusion Annals of Internal Medicine June 1, 1997 vol. 126 no. 11 923-926 In art Alienation is most often represented in literature as the psychological isolation of an individual from society or community. In a volume of Bloom's Literary Themes, Shakespeare's Hamlet is described as the 'supreme literary portrait' of alienation, while noting that some may argue for Achilles in the Iliad. In addition, Bartleby, the Scrivener is introduced as a perfect example because so many senses of alienation are present. Other literary works described as dealing with the theme of alienation are: The Bell Jar, Black Boy, Brave New World, The Catcher in the Rye, The Chosen, Dubliners, Othello, Fahrenheit 451, Invisible Man, Mrs Dalloway, Notes from Underground, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Stranger and The Myth of Sisyphus, The Trial, The Castle, Waiting for Godot, The Waste Land, and Young Goodman Brown.Blake Hobby, Harold Bloom (Ed) Bloom's Literary Themes: Alienation Infobase Publishing, 1 Feb 2009 Contemporary British works noted for their perspective on alienation include The Child in Time, London Fields, Trainspotting, and Regeneration (Senekal, 2008 & 2010b: 102‚Äì123). Sociologist Harry Dahms has analysed The Matrix Trilogy of films in the context of theories of alienation in modern society. He suggests that the central theme of The Matrix is the \\"all-pervasive yet increasingly invisible prevalence of alienation in the world today, and difficulties that accompany attempts to overcome it\\".Harry F. Dahms THE MATRIX Trilogy as Critical Theory of Alienation: Communicating a Message of Radical Transformation. Transdisciplinary Journal of Emergence. 3 (1) 2005: 108‚Äì24. British progressive rock band Pink Floyd's concept album The Wall (1979) and British alternative rock band Radiohead's album OK Computer (1997), both deal with the subject of alienation in their lyrics.

The purpose of elder law planning is to prepare the elderly person for financial freedom and autonomy through proper financial planning and long-term care options. Categories The three major categories that make up elder law are: # Estate planning and administration, including tax questions; # Medicaid, disability and other long-term care issues; and # Guardianship, conservatorship and commitment matters, including fiduciary administration. Other issues found under the umbrella of elder law include such areas as estate planning; wills; trusts; guardianships; protection against elder abuse, neglect, and fraud; end-of-life planning; all levels of disability and medical care; retirement planning; Social Security benefits; Medicare and Medicaid coverage; Medicaid planning (United States); consumer protection; nursing homes and in-home care; powers of attorney; physicians' or medical care directives, declarations and powers of attorney; landlord/tenant needs; real estate and mortgage assistance; various levels of advice, counseling and advocacy of rights; tax issues; and discrimination. History Elder law developed as a specialty because as lifespans increased there was an increased need for medical care, care giving, and financial management. The history of the Older Americans Act (OAA), originally signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 14, 1965 (the same year Medicare was created), claims credit for creating the Administration on Aging (AOA), a division within the Department of Health and Human Services. The OAA also authorized grants to States for community planning and services programs, funding for research, and demonstration and training projects in the field of aging. In 1972 Amendments to the OAA added the national nutrition program for the elderly. The OAA of 2000 was amended on November 13, 2000, to include the National Family Caregiver Support Program, which was intended to help hundreds of thousands of family members who are struggling to care for their older loved ones who are ill or who have disabilities. This program provides grant funding for combined services between state and local agencies for such things as counseling, support groups, respite and other community-based services. These services are focused on the care of the frail and aging members of society. The program also provides services geared towards the family units of grandparents and other older relatives now in the stages of care-taking for related children eighteen years of age and under. Elder law is an expansion of the traditional trust and estates practice. Careers in or associated with elder law Careers that are developing around the area of Elder Law include social workers, lawyers, paralegals, legal assistants, legal secretaries, guardians ad litem (GAL), various types of psychologists, care givers, financial planners, policy makers and legal advocates, benefit specialists, Better Business Bureau, Attorney General's Office, Consumer Protection Agency, political watch-dog groups, health care providers, researchers, funeral planners, grief counselors, case workers, abuse & fraud investigators, educators, product developers, transportation providers, entertainment and tour guides, real estate agents, mortgage brokers, insurance providers, or simply elder companions. Essentially any career field can create a benefit to the aging of modern society. See also *Elder rights *Gerontology *Nursing home residents' rights References *Kenney F. Hegland & Robert B.

Biography Erna Weber was born in Spandau, Berlin. As a child, her voice attracted attention both at school and in the church choir in which she sang. In 1921, she married Hermann Sack, of Jewish descent. She studied at the Prague Conservatory, and later privately in Berlin with Oscar Daniel. Her career accelerated in 1930 when her uncanny ability to sing stratospheric high notes, including \\"C above high C\\" (C7), was discovered. Richard Strauss wrote a new cadenza for her high voice, for her to sing as Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos. In 1931, she sang Norina in Donizetti's Don Pasquale at Bielefeld Opera, where her voice made a great impression and her gifts were immediately recognised. The Theater Wiesbaden engaged her in 1932, and in that year she also made several radio broadcasts and recordings. In 1934 she was engaged by the Breslau Opera, where her roles included her first Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos, and the following year arrived at the Semperoper in Dresden, where she attracted the attention of Karl B√∂hm and, above all, Strauss. In 1934 she also made a spectacular return to Berlin, appearing as Gilda in Verdi's Rigoletto alongside Heinrich Schlusnus as the Jester and Walther Ludwig as the Duke under the baton of Erich Kleiber. In 1935, Erna Sack made her first series of concert tours, to Austria, the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom. During the same year, she signed an exclusive recording contract with Telefunken. She appeared in the world premiere of Strauss's Die schweigsame Frau as Isotta, a role in which her special commitment earned her the gratitude of both Strauss and Karl B√∂hm. As a result, she was invited to sing the part of Zerbinetta under Strauss's personal direction when the Dresden State Opera visited the Covent Garden Royal Opera House in 1936. From this point onwards Sack's career took off. She seemed to work tirelessly, at the opera, in concert tours, and touring, including to Rome where she appeared in Mozart's The Magic Flute with a cast that included Tito Schipa and Licia Albanese, Copenhagen, Oslo, and, for the first time, the United States, where she shared a platform at Carnegie Hall with Joseph Schmidt and Richard Tauber (24 October 1937) singing a duet from Leh√°r's The Merry Widow. She had some difficulty, however, when asked to sing at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, being asked to sing the roles of Rosina and Donizetti's Lucia in the Italian language, because she argued that she had not had sufficient time to re-learn those roles in their original language (throughout Europe at that time operas were largely sung in the tongue of the nation in which they were being performed). During the war, her Jewish husband was imprisoned in a concentration camp. After World War II, Sack toured extensively and was particularly successful in Latin America, especially Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil (with the result that she and her husband took Brazilian citizenship). However, it was in Canada that she enjoyed her greatest post-war successes and for a number of years the couple lived in Montreal. She later toured South Africa and South-West Africa, and she returned to West Germany in 1950. In 1953, she carried out an extended tour of the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin, a marathon undertaking involving over 40 concerts that was followed that autumn by a major tour of Australia and New Zealand. In the autumn of 1954 she celebrated her return to the United States which included a triumphant appearance at Carnegie Hall. She ended her concert career with one final tour of West Germany in the autumn of 1954, a concert at Constitution Hall, Washington, D.C. in 1956 and a brief tour of East Germany in 1957, and then withdrew from public life. Sack also appeared in numerous films produced in Germany such as Flowers from Nice (1936) and Nanon, the latter being one of the most famous operettas produced in this period. Throughout her career Sack recorded profusely, first on acetate, then, starting about 1935, on the new German invention ‚Äì the AEG Magnetophon. Recording on tape proved to be infinitely superior to disc and very considerable quantities of those recordings were later transferred to long- playing records (LPs). She died in a Mainz clinic on 2 March 1972 following an operation for cancer. She was buried in South Cemetery Wiesbaden.

The republic is notable for being the chosen death place of Mahavira and Gautama Buddha. History Malla was one of the solasa (16) mahajanapadas of ancient India mentioned in the Anguttara Nikaya. It was named after the ruling clan of the same name. The Mahabharata (VI.9.34) mentions the territory as the Mallarashtra (Malla state). The Malla mahajanapada was situated north of Magadha. It was a small mahajanapada. The mahajanapada was divided into two main parts and the river Kakuttha (present day Kuku) was probably the dividing line. The capital of these two parts were Kusavati (modern Kasia near Gorakhpur) and Pava, modern Padrauna, 12 miles from Kasia.Raychaudhuri, Hemchandra (1972) Political History of Ancient India, University of Calcutta, Calcutta, pp. 85, 113 =War over the Buddha's relics= The Mallas defending the city of Kushinagara. Reflective of the frieze at Stupa 1, Southern Gateway, Sanchi, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE. Leader of the Mallas of Kushinagara, under siege by the seven kings during the War of the Relics. Reflective of the frieze at Sanchi. Kusinagara and Pava are very important in the history of Buddhism since Buddha took his last meal and was taken ill at Pava and went to his Mahaparinirva·πáa at Kusinagara. After his death, the Mallas wanted to keep the ashes, but the other kingdoms also wanting their part went to war and besieged the city of Kushinagara. Finally, an agreement was reached, and the Buddha's cremation relics were divided among 8 royal families and his disciples; centuries later they would be enshrined by King Ashoka into 84,000 stupas. A famous view in Sanchi shows the siege of Kushinagara, giving a view of the city which has been relied on for the understanding of ancient Indian constructions. The Mallas were a powerful clan of eastern IndiaLaw, B.C. (1973). Tribes in Ancient India, Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp.257-62 at the time of Gautama Buddha and they are frequently mentioned in Buddhist and Jaina works. The Mahabharata (II.30.3) mentions that the second Pandava Bhima is said to have conquered the chief of the Mallas in course of his expedition to eastern India. The Mahabharata (VI.9.46) mentions Mallas along with the Angas, Vangas, and Kalingas as eastern tribes. The Mallas were republican people with their dominion consisting of nine territories (Kalpa Sutra; Nirayavali Sutra), one of each of the nine confederated clans. The Mallas, like the Licchavis, are mentioned by Manusmriti as Vratya Kshatriyas.Buddhism, Diplomacy, and Trade: The Realignment of Sino-Indian Relations, 600-1400 By Tansen Sen They are called Vasishthas (Vasetthas) in the Mahapparnibbana Suttanta. The Mallas were a brave and warlike people. Jainism and Buddhism found many followers among the Mallas. The Mallas originally had a monarchical form of government but later they switched to Gana (republic or non-monarchial) of which the members called themselves rajas. The Gana were taking decisions from their Santhagara. The Mallas appeared to have formed alliance with Lichchhavis for self-defense. They however, lost their independence not long after Buddha's death and their dominions were annexed to the Magadhan empire. The two main towns of the Malla mahajanapada were Pava, where the 24th Jain lord Mahavira achieved Nirvana and Kusinara (Kushinagara), where Buddha went to his Mahaparinirva·πáa. The Cullavagga of the Vinaya Pitaka mentions another town named Anupiya. A fourth town called Uruvelakappa is mentioned in the Anguttara Nikaya. The fifth town was named as \\"Bhoganagara\\".

Although Hanyu Pinyin is adopted as the preferred romanisation system for Mandarin and the standard of Chinese education, the general lack of a romanisation standard for other Chinese varieties results in some level of inconsistency. This may be illustrated by the many variants for the same Chinese characters often found in surnames such as Low, Loh, Lo; Tay, Teh; Teo, Teoh; Yong, Yeong. The surname Zheng () alone has several variations including Teh, Tay, Tee, Chang, Chung, Cheng, and Zeng. The variations Tay or Tee come from Singapore, while Teh or Tee normally have roots in Malaysia, Chang, Chung or Cheng from Hong Kong, and Zeng or Zheng normally from Mainland China. Place names Since the founding of modern Singapore in 1819 and with large numbers of migrants predominantly from Southern China, Chinese placenames began to enter local vocabulary in place of traditionally Malay-based names mostly given by the Orang Laut communities. These names, however, are usually referred to in the dialects of whichever group accords that place a certain name, with some places having entirely different names for the same feature. In most places, however, the same name is used but referred to by an individual's dialect. When there was a need to record place names by the British administration, Chinese place names were anglicised using an almost ad-hoc means of finding the closest set of letters reflecting local pronunciations of these names; a situation which often spawned conflicting spellings, some of which still persist to this day. The older spelling of Chua Chu Kang (), a suburban area and village in western Singapore, is now more commonly spelled as Choa Chu Kang after the new town by the same name took its spelling from Choa Chu Kang Road, itself an anomaly as the village and the surrounding cemeteries were then spelled in the old way. Today, the village no longer exists, but the cemeteries continue to be referred to as Chua Chu Kang, while all place names in Choa Chu Kang New Town take on the newer spelling. From the mid-1980s, the drive to encourage the use of Pinyin filtered down to place names, resulting in some amendments. Aukang (also spelled \\"Aokang\\") is Teochew for Hougang (), but was romanised as Hougang when the Hougang New Town was built. Some changes met with popular opposition, particularly over the English spelling of Yishun (), which has been well known as Nee Soon in Hokkien (Min Nan) until the government tried to introduce pinyin when Yishun New Town appeared. The disagreements led to \\"Nee Soon\\" retaining its presence in Nee Soon Road, as well as some place names such as Nee Soon Camp and in the names of political subdivisions. In contrast, pinyin was generally welcomed in Bishan (), named after what was popularly known as \\"Peck San\\" in Cantonese. The popularity was not over the pinyin system itself, but over the fact that Peck San was well known for its association with the Peng San Cemetery, which has since been exhumed to build Bishan New Town. To the local Chinese, Bishan, although actually similar in name to Peck San in Chinese, is as good as a different name by virtue of its different romanisation spelling alone. Another controversy surrounded the renaming of Tekka Market (derived from Hokkien Tek Kia Kha (PeÃçh-≈çe-jƒ´: Tek-√°-kha), literally meaning \\"foot of the small bamboos\\"), then one of the largest wet markets in Singapore located at the junction of Serangoon and Bukit Timah Road. When the old market was torn down and rebuilt across the road, the new multi-use complex was named Zhujiao Centre, which is the pinyin version of that name. However, to locals, especially non-Chinese, the new word was both hard to read and pronounce and bore no resemblance to Tekka. Eventually, the complex was officially named Tekka Centre in 2000 after two decades of public pressure. Personal names A large majority of Chinese people in Singapore are Hokkien (Min Nan speakers), and a lesser number Teochew. Hokkien and Teochew share many phonemes to the point that they are mutually intelligible. Thus the romanisations are similar and surnames such as Tan (), Chua (), Koh (), etc., are very common.ÁΩóÂÅ•Êòé„ÄäÊñ∞Âä†Âù°Âçé‰∫∫ÂßìÊ∞èÊãºÂÜôÊ≥ïÁ†îÁ©∂„Äã References External links *Naming patterns amongst ethnic-Chinese Singaporeans *Road names as markers of history *Buffalo Pens - the politics of renaming places Chinese languages in Singapore Romanization of Chinese ","title":"Chinese language romanisation in Singapore"},{"id":"2943053","text":"Havre Saint-Pierre Water Aerodrome, , is located east northeast of Havre- Saint-Pierre, Quebec, Canada.

Its aims are to disseminate information about insects and improving communication between entomologists. The society was founded in 1833 as the Entomological Society of London. It had many antecedents beginning as the Society of Entomologists of London. History The foundation of the society began with a meeting of \\"gentlemen and friends of entomological science\\", held on 3 May 1833 in the British Museum convened by Nicholas Aylward Vigors with the presidency of John George Children. Those present were the Reverend Frederick William Hope, Cardale Babington, William Yarrell, John Edward Gray, James Francis Stephens, Thomas Horsfield, George Thomas Rudd and George Robert Gray. Letters of Adrian Hardy Haworth, George Bennett and John Curtis were read where they expressed their regrets to be unable to attend the meeting. They decided that a society should be created for the promotion of the science of entomology in its various branches and it should be called the Entomological Society of London. J. G. Children, F. W. Hope, J. F. Stephens, W. Yarrell and G. Rudd were elected to form a committee, with G. R. Gray as secretary. J. G. Children became the first president and William Kirby (1759‚Äì1850) was made honorary president for life. The real date of the foundation of the society was more probably on 22 May 1833, when the members met in Thatched House Tavern, on St James's Street. During this meeting, George Robert Waterhouse (1810‚Äì1888) was elected librarian and curator of the insects and records. As of this meeting, foreign honorary members were elected: Johann Cristoph Friedrich Klug (1775‚Äì1856), Wilhem de Haan (1801‚Äì1855), Victor Audouin (1797‚Äì1841), Johann Ludwig Christian Gravenhorst (1777‚Äì1857), Christian Rudolph Wilhelm Wiedemann (1770‚Äì1840), Carl Eduard Hammerschmidt (1800‚Äì1874) and Alexandre Louis Lef√®bvre de C√©risy (1798‚Äì1867). William Blandell Spence (1813‚Äì1900) received the task of maintaining of the relations with continental entomologists. The society started to assemble a library, an early addition being the personal library of Adrian Hardy Haworth (1767‚Äì1833), purchased by John Obadiah Westwood (1805‚Äì1893) on behalf of the society. The insect collection also increased. In September 1834, the society numbered 117 honorary members and 10 full members. Women were allowed membership and profited from the same rights as the men. A publication commenced in November 1834 under the title Transactions of the Entomological Society of London. Secretary G. R. Gray resigned in the same year then and was replaced by J. O. Westwood. Under the impulse of this last entomologist, who had many functions, the society made great strides. It was in particular attended regularly by Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì1882) on his return from the voyage on H.M.S. Beagle: he became a member of the council and vice-president in 1838. J. O. Westwood left his functions in 1848 and was replaced by Edward Doubleday (1810‚Äì1849) and William Frederick Evans. They in their turn were soon replaced. In 1849, a secretary charged to collect the minutes of the meetings was named in the person of John William Douglas (1814‚Äì1905), a position he kept until 1856. He was assisted in 1851-1852 by Henry Tibbats Stainton (1822‚Äì1892), in 1853-1854 by William Wing (1827‚Äì1855), in 1855-1856 by Edwin Shepherd who then replaced J.W. Douglas in his position. Edward Wesley Janson (1822‚Äì91), a natural history agent, publisher and entomologist was Curator of the Entomological Society collections from 1850‚Äì63 and librarian from 1863‚Äì74. Edward Mason Janson (1847‚Äì1880) took over the post of curator from Frederick Smith (1805‚Äì1879) who then left to work in the British Museum. H. T. Stainton, who was involved more and more in the life of the society, seemed to have some problems working with E. M. Janson. He was replaced by W. Wing in 1852. In this year, the society moved from its building at 17, Old Bond Street to 12, Bedford Row. The following year, three of the four most responsible for the society were replaced: Edward Newman (1801‚Äì1876) took the place of J. O. Westwood as president, Samuel Stevens (1817‚Äì1899) took the place of W. Yarrell as treasurer and W. Wing the place of H. T. Stainton as secretary. In 1885 Queen Victoria granted the society its royal charter. In 1933, the society's centenary year, King George V granted it the privilege of adding the word \\"Royal\\" to its title, making it the Royal Entomological Society. Structure and activities The society's patron is Her Majesty The Queen and its vice- patron is The Earl of Selborne. The society is governed by its council, which is chaired by the society's president, according to a set of by-laws. The members of council, the president and the other officers are elected from the society's fellowship and membership. The aim of the Royal Entomological Society is the improvement and diffusion of entomological science. This is achieved through publications, scientific meetings, supporting and funding entomological expeditions, and public events. The society maintains an entomological library at its headquarters in St Albans, UK. and convenes over 15 special interest groups, covering a range of scientific fields within entomology. With the support of over 60 partner organisations, the society organises National Insect Week, a biennial initiative to engage the public with the importance of insects and entomology, through hundreds of events and activities across the UK. The society also organises Insect Festivals, a biennial series of one day events in York and Bristol celebrating insects and entomology. In 2016 the society held its first EntoSci conference, EntoSci16, to promote entomology to 14 to 18 year olds, the event is now held biennially. Publications  The society publishes seven scientific journals: * Agricultural and Forest Entomology * Ecological Entomology * Insect Conservation and Diversity * Insect Molecular Biology * Medical and Veterinary Entomology * Physiological Entomology * Systematic Entomology Members and fellows receive the quarterly entomological news journal Antenna. The society also publishes a series of handbooks on the identification of insects. The aim of these handbooks is to provide illustrated identification keys to the insects of Britain, together with concise morphological, biological and distributional information. The series also includes several Check Lists of British Insects. All books contain line drawings, with the most recent volumes including colour photographs. In recent years, new volumes in the series have been published by Field Studies Council, and benefit from association with the AIDGAP identification guides and Synopses of the British Fauna. Fellowship The Royal Entomological Society has an international membership and invites applications for Fellowship from those who have made a substantial contribution to entomology, through publications or other evidence of achievement. Applications are referred to a Committee of Council, who then forward a recommendation to Council. Fellows are entitled to make use of the title \\"Fellow of the Royal Entomological Society\\" and the suffix \\"FRES\\" may be regarded as an academic qualification.RES, 2009.

The seal was first used for a letter by the society to William Kirby, which was signed by the President and 30 members in 1836 to thank him for presenting the society with a cabinet containing his entire insect collection. William Kirby was responsible for classifying the Strepsiptera as a separate order. The society's badge has remained almost unchanged since its first use.President Address - Hugh Loxdale, 3 May 2006 Officers =Honorary life Presidents= * 1833‚Äì1850: William Kirby * 1883‚Äì1893: John Obadiah Westwood * 1933‚Äì1943: Edward Bagnall Poulton =Presidents= The following persons have been presidents of the society:List of Fellows and members, Royal Entomological Society, 2002 * 1833‚Äì1834: John George Children * 1835‚Äì1836: Frederick William Hope * 1837‚Äì1838: James Francis Stephens * 1839‚Äì1840: Frederick William Hope * 1841‚Äì1842: William Wilson Saunders * 1843‚Äì1844: George Newport * 1845‚Äì1846: Frederick William Hope * 1847‚Äì1848: William Spence * 1849‚Äì1850: George Robert Waterhouse * 1852‚Äì1853: John Obadiah Westwood * 1853‚Äì1854: Edward Newman * 1855‚Äì1856: John Curtis * 1856‚Äì1857: William Wilson Saunders * 1858‚Äì1859: John Edward Gray * 1860‚Äì1861: John William Douglas * 1862‚Äì1863: Frederick Smith * 1864‚Äì1865: Francis Polkinghorne Pascoe * 1866‚Äì1867: John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury * 1868‚Äì1869: Henry Walter Bates * 1870‚Äì1871: Alfred Russel Wallace * 1874‚Äì1875: William Wilson Saunders * 1878: Henry Walter Bates * 1879‚Äì1880: John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury * 1881‚Äì1882: Henry Tibbats Stainton * 1883‚Äì1884: Joseph William Dunning * 1885‚Äì1886: Robert McLachlan * 1887‚Äì1888: David Sharp * 1889‚Äì1890: Lord Thomas de Grey Walsingham * 1891‚Äì1892: Frederick DuCane Godman * 1893‚Äì1894: Henry John Elwes * 1895‚Äì1896: Raphael Meldola * 1897‚Äì1898: Roland Trimen * 1899‚Äì1900: George Henry Verrall * 1901‚Äì1902: William Weekes Fowler * 1903‚Äì1904: Edward Bagnall Poulton * 1905‚Äì1906: Frederick Merrifield * 1907‚Äì1908: Charles Owen Waterhouse * 1909‚Äì1910: Frederick Augustus Dixey * 1911‚Äì1912: Francis David Morice * 1913‚Äì1914: George Thomas Bethune-Baker * 1915‚Äì1916: Nathaniel Charles Rothschild * 1917‚Äì1918: Charles Joseph Gahan * 1919‚Äì1920: James John Walker * 1921‚Äì1922: Lionel Walter Rothschild * 1923‚Äì1924: Edward Ernest Green * 1927‚Äì1928: James Edward Collin * 1929‚Äì1930: Karl Jordan * 1931‚Äì1932: Harry Eltringham * 1933‚Äì1934: Edward Bagnall Poulton * 1934‚Äì1935: Sheffield Airey Neave * 1936‚Äì1937: Augustus Daniel Imms * 1938‚Äì1939: John Claud Fortescue Fryer * 1940‚Äì1941: Kenneth Gloyne Blair * 1942‚Äì1943: Patrick Alfred Buxton * 1943‚Äì1944: Edward Alfred Cockayne * 1945‚Äì1946: Geoffrey Douglas Hale Carpenter * 1947‚Äì1948: Carrington Bonsor Williams * 1949‚Äì1950: Sir Vincent Brian Wigglesworth * 1951‚Äì1952: Norman Denbigh Riley * 1953‚Äì1954: Patrick Alfred Buxton * 1955‚Äì1956: Wilfrid John Hall * 1957‚Äì1958: Owain Westmacott Richards * 1959‚Äì1960: Boris Petrovitch Uvarov * 1961‚Äì1962: George Copley Varley * 1963‚Äì1964: Sir Vincent Brian Wigglesworth * 1965‚Äì1966: Eric Omar Pearson * 1967‚Äì1968: John Stodart Kennedy * 1969‚Äì1970: Howard Everest Hinton * 1971‚Äì1972: Colin Gasking Butler * 1973‚Äì1974: Anthony David Lees * 1975‚Äì1976: Donald Livingston Gunn * 1977‚Äì1978: John David Gillett * 1979‚Äì1980: Reginald Charles Rainey * 1981‚Äì1982: Helmut Fritz van Emden * 1983‚Äì1984: Sir Thomas Richard Edmund Southwood * 1985‚Äì1986: Trevor Lewis * 1987‚Äì1988: Victor Frank Eastop * 1989‚Äì1990: Jack P.

Their headquarters is at 41-42 Craven Street, London WC2, of which no 41 is a Grade II listed building. History After the establishment of the British Optical Association (BOA) in 1895, several more professional bodies were formed for the development of British optometry, with at least six separate qualifying associations existing in the period prior to the passing of the Opticians Act (1958). By that year only four were authorised to conduct examinations and award professional qualifications statutorily approved by the General Optical Council (GOC). In 1962 the Institute of Optical Science (tracing its history, via predecessor bodies to 1905) merged with the BOA, leaving only three approved professional bodies. The creation of a single new professional body in the form of a Royal College for optometrists was suggested in 1972 in a letter published by Rishi Agarwal.Agarwal, R.

(1983), The Editor's Round, The way we thought 10 years ago, Optician, volume 185, number 4795, page 6. The College was established in 1980 by three separate bodies, the former British Optical Association founded in 1895 and the Scottish Association of Opticians tracing its history to 1922 (both of which were disbanded in 1980) and the Worshipful Company of Spectacle Makers (incorporated by a Royal Charter in 1629 during the reign of King Charles I) which had run qualifying exams since 1898 but surrendered its examining function to the new College. In 1980 the title British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists) was adopted. In 1987 the title was changed to British College of Optometrists and in 1995 the title College of Optometrists was adopted. Royal charter The College of Optometrists was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth II on 18 September 1995.Agarwal, R.

Location Shortly before its formal foundation, the College was based at 10 Knaresborough Place in Earls Court, London in a town house purchased for it by the British Optical Association. The College moved to its current headquarters at 41-42 Craven Street in December 1997. The premises comprise two former townhouses, originally built in the 1730s, but with later additions. These were originally mid-terrace properties but following demolitions in the 1970s they now represent the end of the Georgian block on the east side of the street. It has transpired that one of houses (no 41) accommodated a business selling telescopes and optical 'toys' in the 1820s.Martin Levy, Elaine Moss; John Coleman Isaac, ‚ÄòImporter of Curiosities‚Äô: An outline of his life, and the 1846 Continental Diary, Journal of the History of Collections, Volume 14, Issue 1, 1 May 2002, Pages 97‚Äì114, https://doi.org/10.1093/jhc/14.1.97 Secretariat The College is also the registered office of the European Academy of Optometry and OpticsEuropean Academy of Optometry and Optics.

A highly shrewd and ambitious woman, she was the political adviser of the teenage emperor and the de facto regent of the Mughal Empire from 1560 to 1562. Biography Maham Anga was Akbar's chief nurse prior to his enthronement at age thirteen as Mughal emperor in 1556. Her own son, Adham Khan, as Akbar's foster brother, was regarded as almost one of the imperial family. Maham Anga, shrewd and ambitious and very much in charge of the household and harem, sought to advance her own authority and that of her son. In 1560, the two tricked Akbar into coming to India without his regent and guardian Bairam Khan and they were able to convince Akbar that now that he was seventeen, he did not need Bairam. Akbar dismissed his regent and sent him on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Months later, Bairam was murdered by an Afghan and much of the former's power passed on to Maham Anga. Death Adham Khan's violent execution for the murder of Ataga Khan, Akbar‚Äôs favourite general Shams-ud- Din, at the hands of the young Emperor himself no less in May, 1562, profoundly affected her. She famously commented You have done well to Akbar when he broke the news to her; she died shortly afterwards. Her tomb and that of her son, known as Adham Khan's Tomb, was built by Akbar, and popularly named Bhul-bulaiyan, owing to the labyrinth in its structure, lies north of the Qutub Minar in Mehrauli.

An example of a late medieval roll of arms. College of Arms, London. Roll of arms of the knights of the Golden Fleece. Made in the first half of the 16th century. A roll of arms (or armorial) is a collection of coats of arms, usually consisting of rows of painted pictures of shields, each shield accompanied by the name of the person bearing the arms. The oldest extant armorials date to the mid 13th century, and armorial manuscripts continued to be produced throughout the Early Modern period. Siebmachers Wappenbuch of 1605 was an early instance of a printed armorial. Medieval armorials usually include a few hundred coats of arms, in the late medieval period sometimes up to some 2,000. In the early modern period, the larger armorials develop into encyclopedic projects, with the Armorial g√©n√©ral de France (1696), commissioned by Louis XIV of France, listing more than 125,000 coats of arms. In the modern period, the tradition develops into projects of heraldic dictionaries edited in multiple volumes, such as the Dictionary of British Arms in four volumes (1926-2009), or J. Siebmacher's gro√ües Wappenbuch in seven volumes (1854-1967). Armorials can be \\"occasional\\", relating to a specific event such as a tournament; \\"institutional\\", associated with foundations, such as that of an order of chivalry, \\"regional\\", collecting the arms of the nobility of a given region, \\"illustrative\\", in the context of a specific narrative or chronicle, or \\"general\\", with the aim of an encyclopedic collection.A New Dictionary of Heraldry, 1987 A roll of arms arranged systematically by design, with coats featuring the same principal elements (geometrical ordinaries and charges) grouped together as a tool to aid identification, is known as an ordinary of arms (or simply as an ordinary).

Some of the colonial forces, which served the states of Australia at the time, were gradually united into federal units between 1899 and 1903; thus forming the beginning of the Australian Army. The colonial armies were officially united as the Commonwealth Military Forces by the Defence Act 1903 (Cwlth). Since then, the Australian Army as an organisation has changed to suit to needs of the nation, with particular changes occurring during and following the World Wars, Korean War, Vietnam War and Gulf War. In 1916 the title 'Australian Military Forces' was adopted and remained its official name until 1980, after which it became known as the Australian Army.Dennis et al 2008, p. 47. The Two Armies: Militia and Permanent forces 1870‚Äì1947 For more than 80 years after the first British settlement, the only professional soldiers in Australia were members of British Army garrisons. The first conflicts in which large numbers of Australian-born soldiers fought overseas were the New Zealand Wars, between 1863‚Äì1872, although almost all of these‚Äîabout 2,500 men‚Äîserved in New Zealand colonial units, or the British Army. By the time that the garrisons were withdrawn in 1870, the six separate self-governing colonies in Australia already had their own separate, part-time reserve units, known as militia or \\"volunteers\\". The colonial governments began to raise professional artillery units, to staff coastal batteries. From 1877 onwards, the British sent officers to advise the colonies on defence matters, and in the early 1880s, the first inter-colonial defence conferences were held. In 1885, the government of New South Wales sent an infantry battalion, with artillery and support units to the short-lived British campaign in Sudan. During the economic depression of the early 1890s, large-scale strikes in various colonies were met with governments mobilising and/or threatening to use militia against strikers. This was very unpopular and led to successful and historically-significant campaigns against the formation of standing, regular forces. The \\"two armies\\" system was established whereby the only infantry units would be militia, although permanent artillery and other support units remained. As Federation of the colonies approached, on 24 August 1899 the colonial artillery units were merged into the first Australian federal army unit. =Boer War 1899‚Äì1902= Australian and British officers in South Africa during the Second Boer War Before Federation of Australia and the forming of the national army, the six self-governing and independent Australian colonial governments sent contingents to South Africa to serve in the Second Boer War. The first offer of 250 mounted troops came from the new colony of Queensland in July 1899, some months before the declaration of war. The first arrivals of Australian troops was the First New South Wales Contingent which arrived in November 1899, after departing London. A detachment, sent from Australia in October 1899, was known as the Australian Regiment and was an infantry unit, made up mainly of volunteers from the Colonies of Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, who left on one ship for Cape Town. Due to the way the war developed, these troops were converted from infantry to mounted infantry. Strong resistance from the Boer Afrikaner forces led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies. Known as Bushmen's Contingents, these soldiers were usually volunteers with horse-riding and shooting skills but no military experience. After Federation in 1901, eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions were sent. Many of the Australian units had a short tour of duty and some were subject to restructuring. Later Australians transferred to, or enlisted into multinational units, such as the Bushveldt Carbineers, in which Harry \\"Breaker\\" Morant and Peter Hancock served, before their court martial and execution for alleged war crimes. Australian units served at many notable actions, including the relief of Mafeking, Sunnyside, Slingersfontein, Pink Hill, the Relief of Kimberley, Paardeburg, Bloemfontein, the Siege of Eland's River, Rhenosterkop and Haartebeestefontein. Australians were there for the capture of Johannesburg and were first into Pretoria. Later they participated at Diamond Hill. In all, 16,175 Australians, with 16,314 horses, served in the Boer War; 251 were killed in action, 267 died of other causes and 43 went missing in action. Six Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians, five serving with Australian contingents and one serving with the South African Constabulary. Many Australians did more than one tour of duty and a number remained after the war and settled in-country; while others returned to Australia then returned to South Africa. =The Boxer Rebellion 1900= The Boxer Rebellion in China began in 1900, and a number of western nations‚Äîincluding many European powers, the United States, and Japan‚Äîsoon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests. In June, the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China with Naval Brigade reservists, who had been trained in both ship handling and soldiering to fulfil their coastal defence role. The colonies dispatched 200 men from Victoria, 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector, under the command of Captain William Creswell. Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks, Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War. The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors. The NSW Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks. The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the NSW Marine Light Infantry.Nicholls 1986, pp. 32‚Äì33. =1901‚Äì1914= As the Boer War raged, the Commonwealth of Australia was founded on 1 January 1901. On 1 March, 28,923 colonial soldiers, being 1,457 professional soldiers, 18,603 paid militia and 8,863 unpaid volunteers, were transferred to the new Australian Army. However, the individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts. Major General Sir Edward Hutton, a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces, became the first commander of the Commonwealth Forces' on 26 December and set to work devising an integrated structure for the new army. The Defence Act of 1903 brought all of the units under one piece of legislation; more significantly, it prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes, and could not serve outside Australia. The vast majority of soldiers remained in militia units, now known as the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). In 1911, two significant changes followed a report by Lord Kitchener: the Royal Military College, Duntroon was established and; a system of universal national service began: boys aged 12 to 18 became cadets, and men aged 18‚Äì26 had to serve in the CMF. =World War I= Recruitment poster, 1914‚Äì1918. When the United Kingdom declared war on Germany at the start of World War I, the Australian government followed without hesitation. This was considered to be expected by the Australian public, because of the very large number of British-born citizens and first generation Anglo- Australians at the time. By the end of the war, almost 20% of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in the United Kingdom, even though nearly all enlistments had occurred in Australia. Because existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas, an all-volunteer expeditionary force, the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was formed from 15 August 1914. The Australian government had pledged to supply 20,000 men, organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. The first commander of the AIF was General William Bridges, who also assumed direct command of the infantry division. However, the first target for Australian action was close to home, seizing German colonial outposts in the south-west Pacific and New Guinea. The 2000-man force assembled for this purpose, known as the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN&MEF;), landed near Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and after some fighting, the German garrison surrendered on 21 September. Departing from Western Australia on 1 November 1914, the AIF was sent initially to British-controlled Egypt, to pre-empt any attack by the Ottoman Empire, and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers. The AIF had four infantry brigades with the first three making up the 1st Division. The 4th Brigade was joined with the sole New Zealand infantry brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division. Australian soldiers landing at ANZAC Cove The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), commanded by British general William Birdwood, went into action when Allied forces landed on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 (now commemorated as Anzac Day). The Gallipoli Campaign would last for eight months of bloody stalemate. By the end of the campaign, Australian casualties were 8,700 killed and 19,000 wounded or sick. The original AIF contingent had continued to grow with the arrival of the 2nd Division which was formed in Egypt and went to Gallipoli in August. After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the infantry underwent a major expansion with the first four brigades, the 1st Division and the 4th Brigade being split to create the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th Brigades. The four new brigades together with the 4th and 8th Brigades formed two additional divisions (4th and 5th). The 3rd Division was formed in Australia and sailed directly to England for further training before moving to the Western Front, in November 1916. The light horse brigades had served dismounted at Gallipoli. In 1916, they were reunited with their horses and formed into the 1st Anzac Mounted Division in Egypt to campaign against Turkish forces in the Sinai and Palestine. Australia also supplied the majority of troops for the newly formed Imperial Camel Corps Brigade. The first Australian division to mount a major attack on the Western Front was the 5th Division. The attack, the Battle of Fromelles, was a disaster with the division suffering 5,500 casualties for no gain. The 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions, combined as I Anzac Corps, fought the Battle of Pozi√®res and subsequent Battle of Mouquet Farm, part of the Battle of the Somme. In Egypt, the light horse had helped repulse the Turkish attempt to capture the Suez Canal in the Battle of Romani. During 1917, the five divisions in France fought in three Allied offensives: the Battle of Bullecourt (part of the Battle of Arras), the Battle of Messines and the Third Battle of Ypres. Meanwhile, the light horse had entered southern Palestine. After two attempts to break through the Turkish defences at Gaza, the decisive victory was achieved in the Third Battle of Gaza in which the Australians captured the town of Beersheba in a dramatic cavalry charge. By the end of the year, British forces had captured Jerusalem. 5th Pioneers at Port Melbourne prior to embarkation, October 1917 The German Spring Offensive of early 1918 broke through British lines north and south of the Somme. The five Australian divisions which had been formed into the Australian Corps on 1 November 1917, were moved south to help halt the German advance. In May, Australian General John Monash was given command of the Australian Corps and the first operation he planned as a corps commander, the Battle of Hamel, is widely regarded as the finest set-piece strategy of the war on the Western Front. The final Allied offensive began with the Battle of Amiens on 8 August, and the Australian Corps, along with the Canadian Corps and the III British Corps, spearheaded the advance north and south of the Somme. By the end of September, the Australian divisions were severely depleted, with only the 3rd and the 5th fit for immediate action. On 5 October the Australian Corps was withdrawn to rest and saw no more fighting before the war ended. In the Middle East, the light horse had endured summer in the Jordan Valley before leading the British offensive in the final Battle of Megiddo. The 10th Light Horse Regiment was the first Allied unit to reach Damascus. A total of 331,814 Australians were sent overseas to serve as part of the AIF, which represented 13% of the Australian male population. About 2,100 women served with the 1st AIF, mainly as nurses. 18% (61,859) of those who served in the AIF were killed or died. The casualty rate (killed or wounded) was 64%, reportedly the highest of any country which took part in World War I. The AIF remained a volunteer force for the duration of the war‚Äîthe only British or Dominion force to do so. Two referendums on conscription had been defeated, preserving the volunteer status, but stretching the reserves towards the end of the war. The AIF also had a desertion rate larger than Britain, mainly because the death penalty was not in force. =1919‚Äì1939= After the end of the First World War, the wartime Australian Imperial Force was demobilised and officially disbanded on 1 April 1921.Grey 2008, pp. 120‚Äì125. In the post war period, the Army was reorganised with the focus being placed on the part-time Militia, which was rebuilt to consist of four infantry divisions (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th), and two cavalry divisions (the 1st and 2nd). In addition, three mixed brigades were raised in Queensland outside the divisional structure (the 11th), Tasmania (the 12th), and Western Australia (the 13th), which would come under the 5th Division's command in the event of a war.Palazzo 2001, pp. 91 & 101. The part-time force was maintained through a mixture of volunteers and compulsory service until the compulsory service scheme was suspended in 1929.Grey 2008, p. 138Keogh 1965, p. 44. A small regular force was maintained during this period, based around the Australian Instructional Corps and the Staff Corps, as well as a limited number of engineer, medical, artillery, ordnance, service support personnel.Grey 2008, p. 141. Training and manning through the interwar years was hampered by limited funding as a result of the Depression, as well as limited and obsolete equipment, and many units during this period were well below full strength.Grey 2008, pp. 138‚Äì143.Palazzo 2002, pp. 65‚Äì67. The contingent of soldiers sent to Britain for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937 became the first Australian soldiers to mount the King's Guard in London. In 1938 the first moves towards the establishment of a regular infantry force were undertaken with the establishment of the Darwin Mobile Force. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 this force was raised as part of the Royal Australian Artillery, even though it consisted of a large number of infantry. =World War II= When the Second World War broke out between Britain and Germany in September 1939, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) was formed, to fight in France. The AIF's main strength would consist of four divisions raised in 1939‚Äì1940: the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th. Major General Thomas Blamey was appointed commander of the 2nd AIF. Compulsory military service was introduced: all men over 21 had to complete three months training with the Militia. However, to ensure home defences, Militia members were barred from joining the AIF. 2/13th Battalion at Tobruk (AWM 020779). After the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) withdrew from France in the Dunkirk evacuation in the face of the German Blitzkrieg, the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, as I Corps, were sent to Egypt. From late 1940, the individual divisions faced Italian and German forces in the North African Campaign. The 6th Division then experienced many casualties in mainland Greece, and on Crete, and 3,000 of its personnel were taken prisoner in this campaign. The 7th Division formed the body of the successful Allied invasion of Vichy French-controlled Lebanon and Syria in 1941. The 9th Division and part of the 7th played a celebrated defensive role at the Siege of Tobruk. In 1941, a start was made on raising the 1st Armoured Division, as part of the AIF. As fears of war with Japan mounted, most of the 8th Division was sent to Singapore, to strengthen the British garrison; the remaining battalions were deployed in the islands to Australia's north, at Rabaul, Ambon and Timor. Following short but bloody campaigns in Malaya and the islands, virtually all of the 8th Division was lost when stronger Japanese forces swept through South East Asia, in early 1942. In the Battle of Singapore alone, more than 15,000 Australians were taken prisoner. The 6th and 7th Divisions were recalled to Australia, as the country faced the prospect of invasion. While Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, had requested that the two AIF divisions be sent to Burma, the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, turned down this request, though he did agree to land two brigades of the 6th Division in Ceylon where they formed part of the island's defences during the early months of 1942. Blamey was appointed Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) in March 1942; in April a major re-organisation took place: the name First Army ‚Äîwhich previously referred to a Militia formation‚Äîwas reassigned to I Corps, which was expanded to army size with the inclusion of Militia divisions. The First Army's initial area of responsibility was the defence of Queensland and northern New South Wales. The Second Army was responsible for south-eastern Australia; the other components of Australia's defences were III Corps (in Western Australia), the Northern Territory Force and New Guinea Force. Conscription was effectively introduced in mid-1942, when all men 18‚Äì35, and single men aged 35‚Äì45, were required to join the CMF. In addition, the Army's armoured force was greatly expanded. Kaiapit, New Guinea in 1943 In February 1942, a change in regulations meant that if 65% of the official, establishment strength of a Militia unit, or 75 per cent of the actual personnel, volunteered for the AIF, the unit became an AIF unit. At the time, the CMF were often scorned as \\"chocolate-tin soldiers\\", or \\"chockos\\", because it was thought they would melt in the heat of battle. Nevertheless, Militia units distinguished themselves and suffered extremely high casualties during 1942, in New Guinea, which was then an Australian territory. The prime example was the 39th (Militia) Battalion, many of them very young, untrained and poorly equipped, who distinguished themselves and suffered heavy casualties, in the stubborn rearguard action on the Kokoda Trail. By late 1942, the 7th Division was beginning to relieve the Militia in New Guinea. In August, as the Kokoda battles raged, Militia and 7th Division units formed the bulk of Australian forces at the Battle of Milne Bay, the first outright defeat inflicted on Japanese land forces. The 6th and 7th Divisions, with Militia units and elements of the 1st Armoured, formed a large part of Allied forces which destroyed the major Japanese beachhead in New Guinea, at the Battle of Buna- Gona. In 1943, the Defence Act was changed to allow Militia units to serve south of the Equator in South East Asia. The 9th Division remained in North Africa and distinguished itself at the Second Battle of El Alamein, after which victory over Erwin Rommel was assured, and returned to Australia in 1943. Later that year it was pitched into battle against Japanese forces in New Guinea. General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific, was resented for his treatment of Australian forces. After the surrender of American forces in the Philippines, Australian ground forces constituted almost all of MacArthur's ground forces. As US forces re-built, however, he increasingly used Australian units for secondary assignments. The campaign on Bougainville after the departure of US forces is considered to be an example of this. Australian soldiers in New Britain in 1945 (AWM 092342). The 1st Army took responsibility for mopping-up and controlling areas which flanked US forces' \\"island-hopping\\" campaign towards Japan. Australian units were also responsible for the last phase of amphibious assaults during the Pacific War: the attacks on Japanese-occupied Borneo, including Tarakan, Brunei, British Borneo, Balikpapan and other targets in Sarawak. Meanwhile, Australian prisoners of the Japanese, were often held in inhumane conditions, such as Changi prison, or in Japan itself. Some were also subject to severe forced labour, including the Burma Railway, or forced long distance marches, such as on Sandakan. There was a very high death rate among Allied prisoners of the Japanese. A planned invasion of the Japanese home island of Honsh≈´ in 1946, Operation Coronet, would probably have included a proposed 10th Division, formed from existing AIF personnel. The operation never proceeded as Japan surrendered prior. Compulsory military service ended in 1945, and most Australian personnel had been demobilised by the end of 1946. Out of more than 724,000 army personnel during World War II, almost 400,000 served outside Australia. More than 18,000 died; 22,000 were wounded and more than 20,000 became prisoners of war. =Occupation of Japan= The British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF), was the name of the joint Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand military forces in occupied Japan, from 21 February 1946 until the end of occupation in 1952. Overall, Australians made up by far the biggest proportion of BCOF, and the army made up of most of the Australians. At its peak, BCOF comprised 40,000 personnel, equal to about 10% of the US military personnel in Japan. The army contingent was centred around Australia's first ever standing infantry unit, the 34th Infantry Brigade, which had been formed from 2nd AIF and Militia personnel on Morotai in late 1945. The three battalions in the Brigade were redesignated to form the Royal Australian Regiment in 1947. The position of General Officer Commanding (GOC) BCOF was always filled by an Australian Army officer. While US forces were responsible for military government, BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarisation and the disposal of Japan's war industries. BCOF was also responsible for occupation of the western prefectures of Shimane, Yamaguchi, Tottori, Okayama, Hiroshima and Shikoku Island. BCOF headquarters was at Kure. According to the AWM: :Australian army .... personnel were involved in the location and securing of military stores and installations. The Intelligence Sections of the Australian battalions were given targets to investigate by BCOF Headquarters, in the form of grid references for dumps of Japanese military equipment. Warlike materials were destroyed and other equipment was kept for use by BCOF or returned to the Japanese. The destruction or conversion to civilian use of military equipment was carried out by Japanese civilians under Australian supervision. Regular patrols and road reconnaissances were initiated and carried out in the Australian area of responsibility as part of BCOF's general surveillance duties. The Australian component of BCOF was responsible for over 20 million Japanese citizens, within a 57,000 square kilometre area. During 1947, the BCOF began to wind down its presence in Japan. However, BCOF bases provided staging posts for Australian and other Commonwealth forces deployed to the Korean War, from 1949 onwards. BCOF was effectively wound-up in 1951, as control of Commonwealth forces in Japan was transferred to British Commonwealth Forces Korea. The modern army, 1947‚Äìpresent Plans for post-war defence arrangements were predicated on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force. In a significant departure from past Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces, the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19,000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support, serving alongside a part-time force of 50,000 men in the Citizen Military Forces.Grey 1999, pp. 195‚Äì196. The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947, while the CMF was re-raised on 1 July 1948.Kuring 2004, pp. 219‚Äì220. In 1953, a contingent of the army was again sent to the coronation, this time of Queen Elizabeth II. Again it mounted the Queen's Guard alongside the Canadian Army contingent. =Korean War= Soldiers from 3 RAR watch as a Korean village burns in late 1950 =Malayan Emergency (1955‚Äì1963)= Although the Royal Australian Air Force had been conducting operations in Malaya since 1950, it was not until October 1955 that the first Army battalion, 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2RAR), was deployed to Penang. However, the battalion did not have approval from the government to conduct operations until January 1956, when it conducted a search and security mission in Kedah. The mission, code-named Operation Deuce, lasted until late April 1956 when 2RAR transferred responsibility of their area to the 1st Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment. In May, 2RAR conducted Operation Shark North in Perak. It was withdrawn from combat operations in August 1957 and left Malaya in October 1957. The battalion suffered 14 killed. In September 1957, 2RAR was replaced by the 3rd battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR), which began patrols as part of Operation Shark North in December. In January 1958, 3RAR began Operation Ginger, a major operation designed to disrupt the food supply to the communist forces. Ginger continued until April 1959 when Perak was declared a safe area. The battalion was withdrawn from operations in September 1959, returning to Australia in October. It had four killed during its tour. In October 1959, 3RAR was replaced by 1RAR. Following a month spent climatising to the jungle, 1RAR participated in Operation Bamboo, a deep jungle search near the Thai- Malay border. This operation met with little success, as insurgents could cross over the border into Thailand, where they could not be followed. In April 1960, 1RAR began Operation Magnet, the first operation in which Australian forces were able to cross the border into Thailand. However, Magnet did not result in any engagements. In July 1960, the Malayan Prime Minister declared the emergency over. Despite this, 1RAR continued operations until the end of its tour in October 1961. The battalion suffered two deaths during its tour. From October 1961 to August 1963, 2RAR conducted its second tour of duty in Perlis and Kedah. =1960‚Äì1965= In 1960 the Army was restructured onto the Pentropic organisation in an attempt to improve its combat power and align it with the US Army. This organisation proved unsuccessful, however, and it reverted to its previous unit organisations in 1965.Grey 2008, pp. 238‚Äì239. =Vietnam War= Australians arrive at Tan Son Nhut Airport, Saigon Australian Army's commitment into Vietnam commenced with a contingent of a specialist group called the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam (AATTV) which commenced in 1962. Later Australian troops and their supports arrived and were assigned the Phuoc Tuy province. The 1st Australian Task Force was based in the province between 1966 and 1971 and consisted of infantry battalions, a Special Air Service Squadron, an artillery regiment and supporting engineer, armoured and armoured personnel carrier squadrons. The Australian Army performed well in Vietnam and inflicted losses on the enemy. While the Army fought few major battles, Australian soldiers fought and destroyed large Vietnamese Communist forces during the Battle of Long Tan 1966 and the fighting around Firebase Coral and the heavy operations in the Long Hai hills (1970). The Australian Army was highly trained at jungle warfare as all infantry and combat units completed a gruelling jungle training course at Canungra in Queensland pre-posting into Vietnam. In all, some 50,000 Australians served in Vietnam of which 520 were killed in battles and many due to mines. The Australians style of warfare differed to that used by the United States Army. The Australians were masters of stealth, patrolling, tracking, searching and ambushing and hitting the enemy's flanks. In 1970, the 1st Australian Task Force in Phuoc Tuoy Province was according to Robert Hall, \\"the most potent allied military force... yet was frequently tied up with reconnaissance-in-force operations\\".Hall 2000, p. 58. =1972‚Äì1990= In 1988, as part of the celebrations for Australia's bicentennial, a detachment of soldiers from the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment became the first Australian troops in a generation to mount the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace in London. =United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) 1989‚Äì90= Australian engineers board the United States C-5 Galaxy aircraft which will transport them to Namibia In 1979, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 435 which called for a peace keeping force to be deployed into the then South West Africa to provide assistance with its transition to the independent nation of Namibia. The multi-national force was to comprise approximately 8,000 military personnel and a large contingent of Civilian Police. However, due to significant difficulties within the UN and in having South African forces withdrawn, the UN force did not deploy until 1989. Australia deployed a combat engineer force of approximately 310 all ranks as part of the military force. The Australian contingent provided engineering support to the UN Force throughout its deployment. Tasks included numerous major construction projects including road and airfield construction, buildings, barracks, schools and other infrastructure to support the UN. The Australians also provided a wide range of assistance to the Namibian people by constructing a variety of civil projects. Of note was the task of battlefield clearance after twenty years of warfare. Much of Namibia was in conflict and resulted in millions of land mines being laid around civilian communities and areas along the northern land border. The removal of these land mines was left to the South African Army, however, tens of thousands remained when RSA forces finally withdrew in 1990. The task then fell to the Australians. Despite the significant danger of this task, a 98% success rate was achieved with many civil communities becoming safe for the first time in decades. The Australia force rotated once after six months deployment and provided continuous engineer support to the UN and Namibia. The force achieved its mission without sustaining any fatalities, making it one of the few military units in UNTAG to do so. Australia's contribution to UNTAG was a success and, as the first deployment of troops to a war zone since the Vietnam War, paved the way for future deployments. =Gulf War= The Australian Army's contribution to the 1991 Gulf War was limited to a small detachment from the 16th Air Defence Regiment. This detachment provided point defence for the Royal Australian Navy ships HMAS Success and HMAS Westralia. A small number of Australian officers on exchange to the British and United States armies served as part of the units they had been posted to. While the Special Air Service Regiment was placed on heightened alert during the war, reports that elements of the SAS were deployed to the Gulf are incorrect. Following the end of the war an Australian Medical Unit of 75 personnel drawn mostly from the Army's 2nd Field Ambulance was briefly deployed to northern Iraq as Australian's contribution to Operation Provide Comfort (designated 'Operation Habitat' by the Australian Defence Force). The Australian Medical Unit operated in Northern Iraq between 16 May and 30 June 1991. =1991‚Äìpresent= Australian soldiers in Somalia during Operation Solace In 2000, the Federation Guard was formed ‚Äì this was a tri-service unit consisting of personnel from the army, RAN and RAAF to serve as ceremonial guards during the celebrations of Australia's Centenary of Federation the following year. In July 2000, a detachment mounted the Queen's Guard in London for three weeks; this included four women, under the command of Captain Cynthia Anderson. These were the first women ever to serve as guards at Buckingham Palace. In August 2009, an alleged plan to attack the Holsworthy Barracks was uncovered by the Australian Federal Police. The alleged terrorist plot was to storm Holsworthy Barracks, a training area and artillery range for the Australian Army located in the outer south-western Sydney suburb of Holsworthy, with automatic weapons; and shoot army personnel or others until they were killed or captured.Cameron Stewart and Milanda Rout, 5 August 2009. \\"Somali extremists on a 'fatwa order' from God\\" .

In Australia it was known as Operation Falconer. In all Australia contributed some 2,000 personnel. The Army contribution to this was 500 soldiers. Following the end of major combat operations, Australia announced a withdrawal of most of its forces in Iraq. It left behind approximately 950 troops in the theatre. These included naval forces, support troops (such as air traffic controllers) and a security detachment of about 75 soldiers in strength to defend key Australian interests. In February 2005, Prime Minister John Howard announced an increase in the Australian presence by about 450 to provide protection for Japanese troops and assist in training Iraqi troops. This force, designated the Al Muthanna Task Group, was deployed to Southern Iraq in May 2005. After Al Muthanna province gained provincial control in mid 2006, the Australian force transitioned into a new role and was retitled the Overwatch Battle Group. OBG(W) relocated its forward operating base from Camp Smitty (outskirts of As Samawah, Al Muthanna province) to Tallil Air Base (outskirts of Nasiriyah, Dhi Qar province) effectively co-locating with the Australian Army Training Team Iraq (AATTI). Australia's contribution to operations in Southern Iraq involved combat overwatch of both Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar province, conduct of CIMIC operations and provision of support and training to the Iraqi Security Forces. After the Labor Government gained power in late 2007, most Australian forces were withdrawn from Iraq in mid-2008.

It includes the army's order of battle and the headquarters locations of major units. Members of the Australian Army also serve within joint units of the Australian Defence Force which fall outside the direct command of the Australian Army. Overview The Australian Army is organised into three main elements which report to the Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large scale ground operations. It does not have any combat units permanently assigned to it, though it commands units during training activities and the Land Combat Readiness Centre reports to the divisional headquarters. Most of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their readiness and preparing them for operations. This organisation came into effect during January 2011; before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.Australian Army (2008), pp. 5‚Äì8International Institute for Strategic Studies (2011), p. 223  Current order of battle  The Australian Army's structure from 2019 The following order of battle describes the Army's current organisational structure at the battalion and independent company/squadron level.

NDProgress was a pressure group or faction within the Canadian federal New Democratic Party. Founded in 2000, NDProgress pushed for structural reform of the party as a means of increasing its electoral success. Started by activists principally from Nova Scotia and Ontario, the group called for five reforms in an open letter to the party signed by Nova Scotia NDP MP Peter Stoffer. The five reforms were: # Introducing a one member one vote system to elect the party leader; # Banning union and corporate donations to the party; # Changing the relationship of the party with the Canadian Labour Congress; # Separating the provincial and federal wings of the party; # Changing the party name. NDProgress emphasized loyalty to the party, avoiding accusations of factionalism that some critics leveled against the New Politics Initiative backed by MP Svend Robinson and social activist Judy Rebick. In the spring of 2001, NDProgress organized a conference in Ottawa where federal leader Alexa McDonough endorsed the one member one vote plank. An amendment to the party's constitution, to provide a variant of one member one vote wherein affiliated labour groups would continue to have their own blocs of votes, was made at the following party convention after an effective lobbying campaign by NDProgress activists. The measure won support across the party. A modified version of the OMOV system proposed by NDProgress was utilised at the 2003 leadership election with the modification being that labour delegates would be allotted weight equivalent to 25% of the overall vote. Subsequently, this modification was eliminated and the 2012 leadership election used the straight OMOV system endorsed by NDProgress. At the convention in 2003, when Jack Layton was elected leader by party members using the new system, NDProgress proposed and won passage of a resolution limiting corporate and union donations, fundamentally changing the financial character of the party. Subsequently, the Jean Chr√©tien government banned corporate and union donations to all political parties. One of NDProgress' co-founders was Dominic Cardy, who became leader of the New Brunswick NDP in 2011biography dominiccardy.ca and subsequently a Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick MLA and cabinet minister.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/cardy-return- possible-1.3918699 References External links *NDProgress discussion papers 2000 establishments in Canada 2011 disestablishments in Canada New Democratic Party (Canada) Political movements in Canada ","title":"NDProgress"},{"id":"2943190","text":"Lucy O'Brien (2012). Lucy O'Brien (born 13 September 1961)Author Biography, O'Brien, Lucy ‚Äì She Bop: The definitive history of women in rock, pop, and soul, London: Penguin, 1995 is an author and journalist whose work focuses on women in music. Early musical and writing career O'Brien was born in Catford, London and grew up in Southampton. In 1979, whilst attending a convent school in Southampton, she formed a punk band aptly named \\"the Catholic Girls\\".O'Brien, Lucy, A kiss in the dreamhouse, in Aizelwood, John, Love Is The Drug, London: Penguin, 1994, pp86-91 She left the band in 1980 to attend University in Leeds, and The Catholic Girls continued for a while under the name Almost Cruelty before splitting up.O'Brien, Lucy ‚Äì Prologue in She Bop: The definitive history of women in rock, pop, and soul, London: Penguin, 1995, pxii At university she played with a number of bands before giving up performing to write instead.O'Brien, Lucy, Prologue in She Bop: The definitive history of women in rock, pop, and soul, London: Penguin, 1995, pxiii She became music editor of the University of Leeds magazine, Leeds Student, and after graduating in 1983, she submitted gig articles to the music paper the New Musical Express (NME), which then published Charles Shaar Murray and Nick Kent. She has since written about the \\"intimidating\\" office culture at NME in the 1980s, and the extent to which female music journalists were ostracised and not taken seriously by the paper. Her best-known contribution to the paper may be the notorious \\"Youth Suicide\\" cover article.Inky Fingers: The NME Story, BBC2, 4 July 2005 Forming an alliance with fellow soul and socialism heads Stuart Cosgrove and Paolo Hewitt, O'Brien became part of a leftist faction at NME which was eventually discharged by incoming editor Alan Lewis ‚Äì an IPC troubleshooter instructed to de-politicise the magazine and boost sales. During her early years at NME, O'Brien also wrote for the feminist magazine, Spare Rib, whose offices she had first visited in 1980.O',Brien, Lucy, A Kiss in the Dreamhouse, in Aizlewood, John, Love Is The Drug, London: Penguin, 1994, pp86-91 In 1984 she co-wrote a cover story for them about women in the music industry. She was shocked to discover just how few women had record deals or were in the charts compared to menO'Brien, Lucy, Introduction in She Bop: The definitive history of women in rock, pop, and soul, London: Penguin, 1995, p2 and this discovery would inspire her later work, particularly She Bop. After leaving NME, O'Brien worked as Music Editor at the London listings magazine City Limits.O'Brien, A Kiss in the Dreamhouse, in Aizlewood, John, Love Is The Drug, London: Penguin, 1994, p96 It was here that she interviewed Dusty Springfield, an interview which led to her being contacted by the publishers Sidgwick & Jackson, and to her being offered the chance to write Springfield's biography. Freelance writing, and books By 1990, O'Brien had gone freelance, going on to write for The Guardian and The Independent, and music magazines Q Magazine and MOJO, amongst others. Her reputation as a writer and commentator was seriously established by the publication of her first book Dusty ‚Äì a best-selling biography of British soul legend Dusty Springfield (Sidgwick & Jackson, 1989). The book was instrumental in the rediscovery and reappraisal of Springfield's work, and was the foundation for O'Brien's reputation as an authority on female artists and soul music. Her next music biography, Annie Lennox (St Martin's Press, 1993), was also published in the United States. O'Brien charted Annie Lennox's career from the early troubled days of The Tourists through to the global success of Eurythmics to Lennox's decision to take a pop sabbatical at the height of her career to work on behalf of the homeless. In 1995, O'Brien took a broader look at female musicians in She Bop: The Definitive History Of Women In Rock, Pop & Soul (Pan, 1995). Using a personal, polemical, and thematic approach, the book begins with the Blues and Jazz Age, and ends with chapters on protest pop and the business side of the music business, taking in chapters on fifties girl pop, sixties girl groups, rock chicks, punk and its feminine descendents, including riot grrrl, singer/songwriters, Madonna, MTV and the power of image, artistry, androgyny and the lesbian question, Disco and the dance scene, rap and reggae, and world music along the way. The second edition of Dusty appeared in 1999 and covered events up to Springfield's death, while the updated She Bop II was published in 2002 by Continuum Press, including more recent artists and a chapter on girl power. In 2007, O'Brien wrote an in-depth biography of Madonna, entitled Madonna: Like an Icon. This was published on 28 August 2007 in the UK and later, on 6 November 2007, in the USA. Television and radio O'Brien's books, notably She Bop, have led to frequent television appearances as an authority on rock music. These include appearances on Channel 4's Top Ten... franchise, and work for BBC2's The Ozone in the late nineties (including a feature exploring the concept of girl power, and an interview with Yoko Ono.) amongst others. O'Brien also co-produced the Channel 4 documentary Righteous Babes, on rock and new feminism, and in 2002 adapted She Bop II as a two-part documentary for BBC Radio 2.

Coldwater fish, in the context of aquariums, refers to fish species that do not require a heater to remain within tolerable temperatures in a typical indoor aquarium. Some examples are koi, goldfish, weather loaches, hillstream loaches, many species of barbs, sunfish of the family Centrarchidae, many Central American cichlids, and a variety of other species. Some, but not all, of these species are capable of surviving in very low temperatures, including ponds, lakes, or rivers that freeze over winter. It is important to note that just because these fish are capable of surviving in unheated aquaria, their temperature preferences may vary. For example, koi and goldfish are commonly considered to be cold-water fish because of their ability to survive at very low temperatures, but their temperature preferences are 32¬∞C (89.6¬∞F) and 28¬∞C (82.4¬∞F), respectively. Because many of the ornamental fish considered to be ‚Äúcoldwater fish‚Äù are more accurately eurythermal fish and many prefer temperatures similar to, or even warmer than those preferred by certain tropical fish, the term ‚Äúcoldwater fish‚Äù in the aquarium context is essentially meaningless, and often misleads pet owners into keeping fish below their preferred temperature.

In organisms it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. It is a viscous transparent liquid at room temperature. Panthenol is used as a moisturizer and to improve wound healing in pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Uses Bepanthen eye and nose ointment (Germany) In pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and personal-care products, panthenol is a moisturizer and humectant, used in ointments, lotions, shampoos, nasal sprays, eye drops, lozenges, and cleaning solutions for contact lenses. In ointments it is used for the treatment of sunburns, mild burns, minor skin injuries and disorders (in concentrations of up to 2‚Äì5%). It improves hydration, reduces itching and inflammation of the skin, improves skin elasticity, and accelerates epidermal wounds' rate of healing. For this purpose, it is sometimes combined with allantoin. It binds to the hair shaft readily; so, it is a common component of commercial shampoos and hair conditioners (in concentrations of 0.1‚Äì1%). It coats the hair and seals its surface, lubricating the hair shaft and giving it a shiny appearance. It is also recommended by tattoo artists as a post-tattooing moisturising cream. Adverse effects Panthenol is generally well tolerated. In rare cases, skin irritation and contact allergies have been reported. Pharmacology Panthenol readily penetrates into the skin and mucous membranes (including the intestinal mucosa), where it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. Pantothenic acid is extremely hygroscopic, that is, it binds water effectively. It is also used in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, which plays a role in a wide range of enzymatic reactions and thus in cell growth. Physical and chemical properties Dexpanthenol Panthenol is an odourless, slightly bitter, highly viscous, transparent and colourless liquid at room temperature, but salts of pantothenic acid (for example sodium pantothenate) are powders (typically white). It is easily soluble in water and alcohol, moderately soluble in diethyl ether, soluble in chloroform (1:100), in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in glycerin. Panthenol's expanded chemical formula is HO‚ÄìCH2‚ÄìC(CH3)2‚ÄìCH(OH)‚ÄìCONH‚ÄìCH2CH2CH2‚ÄìOH. =Stereochemistry= Panthenol comes in two enantiomers, D and L. Only D-panthenol (dexpanthenol) is biologically active, however both forms have moisturizing properties. For cosmetic use, panthenol comes either in D form, or as a racemic mixture of D and L (DL-panthenol).

The game places the player in the role of a police agent who is a member of the titular elite law enforcement agency that specialises in direct armed encounters with adversaries, whether it be on foot or on the bonnet of a speeding car. The player has to try to seize cars and motorbikes while engaging in high-speed chases and gun battles against heavily armed gangs. Gameplay There are a total of 30 missions, six per gang, involving fighting enemies on foot, in a speedboat and a car/motorcycle chases, or in a helicopter while manning a minigun. The player character can leap into enemy vehicles and commandeer them after shooting their occupants. The player can earn different ranks which unlock different content while completing missions will unlock new ranks which will unlock new gang missions and different abilities to help make the game easier, such as regenerating health. The game also includes a race mode with several different courses and scenarios and a time trial mode, setting the player across all the games' tracks. These two modes are completely independent from each other and will not help nor hinder the gameplay of the other game modes. There is also a wide variety of unlockable content such as pictures and videos to access. The amount of content to unlock, however, is completely dependent on the scores in the career mode. Plot The Pursuit Force has been organised to destroy the threat posed by gangs responsible for many vehicle-related crime sprees across Capital State and to eliminate their leaders: *Capelli Family: One of the two gangs that are initially available at the start of the game, the Capellis are Capital State's most powerful Mafia family headed up by Don Capelli, and are said to be 'the state's oldest gang'. The other significant member of the Capelli Family is their best sniper Stefano De Tomaso, also known as 'Deadeye'. *Warlords: The second of the two gangs available at the start of the game, the Warlords are a group of mercenaries and rogue soldiers who feel that they were betrayed by the military. They focus primarily on hijacking military hardware and are led by 'The General', with the other significant member of the gang being 'Lieutenant Davies'. *Convicts: The Convicts are a group of psychotic escapees who are out to cause as much chaos as they can and escape Capital State to cause havoc on a much larger scale. The Convicts are organised by an escapee known only as 'Hard Balls'; the other significant member of the Convicts being the Lieutenant 'Billy Wilde'. *Vixens: The Vixens are an all-female group of professional thieves with a high-tech arsenal whose crimes focus around high- profile heists, from priceless artifacts to luxury speed boats. The Vixens are organised by their leader known as 'Whiplash' and her second-in-command and lover 'The Fox'. *Killer 66: The Killer 66 are Capital State's Yakuza branch, and the most powerful of all five gangs in the game, focusing primary in vehicle smuggling and drug dealing. They are led by 'Monster Toshima', the other significant member of the gang being his second-in-command 'Sudeko Arakawa'. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the game was ported and published by Spike on March 2, 2006, Famitsu gave it a score of two eights and two sevens for a total of 30 out of 40. Detroit Free Press gave it a score of all four stars and said that the game was \\"nearly perfect with its graphics that often look close to cinematic scenes and a whole host of strategies for nailing the bad guys.\\" The Times similarly gave it all five stars and said, \\"Even by the high standards already set, Pursuit Force is an astonishing title... The best PSP title yet.\\" However, The New York Times gave it an average review and said, \\"Apparently the designers were afraid the game might just be too much fun, so they compensated by making the missions brutally, mind-numbingly difficult.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a score of three out of five, saying, \\"Streamlined controls make performing outrageous stunts easy. But car handling is overly rigid making tight bends difficult to negotiate.\\" Sequel A sequel titled Pursuit Force: Extreme Justice was released in 2007.

In October 2012, Nokia sold Vertu to private equity group EQT VI for an unspecified amount, but retained a 10% share. By the end of 2013, the company had around 350,000 customers, and phones were on sale in 500 retail outlets, including 70 run by the company. In 2015, it was announced that EQT had sold its share of Vertu to Godin Holdings, a Hong Kong-based holding company.,. In March of 2017 Godin Holdings sold to Baferton Ltd. a Cyprus-based Turkish company. In July of 2017, the new shareholders applied to the Court of England for bankruptcy protection, the company went into voluntary liquidation after plans to save it failed and Vertu Corporation Ltd. was put into liquidation, leaving its residual staff of 200 unpaid and unemployed.. Vertu AK France, is the parent company of Vertu Corporation, through which the Vertu Brand and company continues its business today. In May 2020 the factory and office complex in Church Crookham England, that has been empty since July 2017 was demolished to make way for a retail park. Concept According to The Economist, the concept was to market phones explicitly as fashion accessories, with the idea \\"if you can spend $20,000 on a watch, why not on a mobile phone?\\" Vertu is the brainchild of the Italian Frank Nuovo, former chief designer at Nokia. He proposed and presented the luxury concept to Nokia's board, who eventually accepted it in late 1998. At the time Nokia released their first luxury phone, the 8850. The resulting products called \\"Vertu\\" were finally announced in Paris in 2002, and part of a separate subsidiary called Vertu owned by Nokia.https://www.forbes.com/2002/01/29/0129tentech.html#71eae3613a59 Vertu phones were made in its factories in Church Crookham, Hampshire, England. Handsets were sold through an emphasis on craftsmanship, style and service, rather than mobile phone functions. The business was based in the United Kingdom with offices in New York City, Dubai, Moscow, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Paris and Singapore. In November 2015, Massimiliano Pogliani was replaced by Billy Crotty as Vertu's CEO, who in turn was replaced by Gordon Watson three months later. Collection Vertu was launched on 21 January 2002 and the first collection available later that year. The flagship model \\"Signature\\" was launched in 2003. Its key pad contains nearly 5 carats of ruby bearings. Other models include Ascent (2004), Constellation Classic (2006), Constellation Ayxta (2009), among others. Ascent phones are designed to be lightweight and durable, made of aluminium or titanium with vulcanised rubber and leather. The Classics are simple and small handsets. Ayxtas are flip phones that come in numerous variants and colours. In 2006, Vertu produced and released the Aerius Bluetooth Headset designed by Jacob Jensen Design.

Announced in October 2010, it is similarly styled to the Nokia E72 and runs the Symbian S60 operating system. It was priced from ¬£5,000 (stainless steel and leather) to ¬£17,300 (yellow gold). This was followed by Constellation in October 2011, the company's first touchscreen model. In February 2013, the Vertu Ti was the first Vertu handset after Nokia's sale, and uses the Android mobile operating system instead of Symbian. This was followed in June 2014, by Signature Touch. The Signature Touch's price ranged from $10,300/‚Ç¨7,900 for the base model to over $50,000/‚Ç¨44,000 for the Pure Jet Red Gold. Vertu also made limited edition handsets in collaboration with Ferrari,\\"Vertu, Ferrari Team Up for Titanium Phone\\", and Bentley. Previously the 2017 version of the Vertu constellation was the last Vertu handset before the company collapsed in 2017. Vertu has since emerged from bankruptcy and introduced the Aster P smartphone in October 2018 at an event in Beijing. However this latest phone was designed and produced in China not in England as all previous models had been. Criticism Vertu phones have been described as \\"tasteless trash\\" by Wired magazine, and \\"technologically modest\\" by the Financial Times. They are often described as bling.

These observations are then kept track of as incidents, which are then used to solve practical problems and develop broad psychological principles. A critical incident can be described as one that makes a contribution‚Äîeither positively or negatively‚Äîto an activity or phenomenon. Critical incidents can be gathered in various ways, but typically respondents are asked to tell a story about an experience they have had. CIT is a flexible method that usually relies on five major areas. The first is determining and reviewing the incident, then fact- finding, which involves collecting the details of the incident from the participants. When all of the facts are collected, the next step is to identify the issues. Afterwards a decision can be made on how to resolve the issues based on various possible solutions. The final and most important aspect is the evaluation, which will determine if the solution that was selected will solve the root cause of the situation and will cause no further problems. History The studies of Sir Francis Galton are said to have laid the foundation for the Critical Incident Technique, but it is the work of Colonel John C. Flanagan, that resulted in the present form of CIT. Flanagan, John C. Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 51, No. 4, July 1954. Flanagan defined the Critical Incident Technique as: Flanagan's work was carried out as part of the Aviation Psychology Program \\"Charged with recruiting other psychologists, Dr. Flanagan was asked to develop the Army Air Corp's program, and, by the end of the war, he had overseen the commissioning of over 150 psychologists. Within its ranks were some of the finest psychologists of the day, including five forthcoming presidents of the American Psychological Association and 11 members of its board of directors. Toward the close of the war, this group of psychologists was involved not only in conducting research regarding the selection and classification of aviators but was also involved in developing training programs and human factors engineering.\\" http://www.apadivisions.org/division-19/publications/newsletters/military/2014/04/aviation- psychology.aspx, paragraph 6 of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, where Flanagan conducted a series of studies focused on differentiating effective and ineffective work behaviors. Flanagan went on to found American Institutes for Research continuing to use the Critical Incident Technique in a variety of research.A Timeline of AIR History, American Institutes for Research http://www.air.org/page/air-history Since then CIT has spread as a method to identify job requirements, develop recommendations for effective practices, and determine competencies for a vast number of professionals in various disciplines. In particular, it has been used in service research. Principal uses CIT can be used in training, systems design and accident investigation. It is an integral part of large scale task analysis. It identifies the most costly happenings in a complex environment where people and machines work as a system. Its origin in investigating pilot errors in wartime,328 et seq and other life-and-death situations, means it identifies top priorities in a man-machine system or other complex action- oriented situation. These priorities then feed into procedures for selection and training, and also (continuing the pilot example) into cockpit instrument design.Fitts P.M. & Jones R.E 1947. Psychological aspects of instrument display: I. Analysis of 270 \\"pilot-error\\" experiences in reading and interpreting aircraft instruments. U.S. Air Forces Materiel Command, Report No. TSEAA-694-12A.Chapanis, Alphonse 1959. Research techniques in human engineering. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, Chapter 3, Methods for the study of accidents and near-accidents. In healthcare, CIT is used in situations where direct examination of clinical staff and researchers can help them better understand their roles and help them solve practical problems. CIT allows clinical staff to better understand their roles in the clinical setting. Another advantage is that it helps them gain better knowledge about their interactions with patients and other clinicians. It also helps clinical staff better understand their practice from a variety of roles (e.g., physician, nurse, clinical educator, nurse informatician, faculty member). In healthcare research, CIT can be a good resource in identifying the experiences of a patient in the healthcare setting, exploring the dimensions of patient‚Äìprovider interactions and determining patient responses to illnesses and treatments. CIT is also widely used in organizational development as a research technique for identification of organizational problems and is suitable for knowledge management in project-based organizations.Haussner et al (2018). \\"Exploring Internationally Operated Construction Projects through the Critical Incident Technique\\". Journal of Management in Engineering 34(5). CIT is used as an interview technique, where the informants are encouraged to talk about unusual organizational incidents instead of answering direct questions. Using CIT deemphasizes the inclusion of general opinions about management and working procedures, instead focusing on specific incidents. In market research, CIT has been used more frequently in the last ten years. Although the CIT method first appeared in the marketing literature thirty years ago, the major catalyst for use of the CIT method in service research appears to have been a Journal of Marketing study conducted by Bitner, Booms, and Tetreault (1990) that investigated sources of satisfaction and dissatisfaction in service encounters. Since the Bitner et al. article, nearly 200 CIT studies have appeared in marketing-related literature.Gremler's article in Journal of Service Research, Vol. 7, No. 1, August 2004. CIT has also been used in studies of information-seeking behavior.\\"How senior managers acquire and use information in environmental scanning\\" by Ethel Auster and Chun Wei Choo (1996).\\"Information sources used by lawyers in problem-solving: An empirical exploration\\" by Margaret Ann Wilkinson (2001).\\"When Is 'Enough' Enough? Modeling the Information-Seeking and Stopping Behavior of Senior Arts Administrators\\" by Lisl Zach (2004). The employment of CIT may also allow construction of typical scenarios of user behavior when they interact with various technologies including information systems. For this, researchers should solicit: # the cause, description and outcome of a critical incident; # users' feelings and perceptions of the situation; # actions taken during the incident; # changes (if any) in their future behavior. The typical scenarios may be presented visually as a diagram or a causal model.Serenko, A. (2006). \\"The use of interface agents for email notification in critical incidents\\". International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 64(11): 1084‚Äì1098. Advantages and disadvantages By identifying possible problems associated with major user‚Äìsystem or product complications, CIT recommendations try to ensure that the same type of situations do not result in a similar loss. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using this method, as shown below. Overall, however, CIT has been demonstrated to be a sound method since first presented in 1954. Relatively few modifications have been suggested to the method in the more than 50 years since it was introduced, and only minor changes have been made to Flanagan's original approach, indicating reasonable robustness. =Advantages= * Flexible method that can be used to improve multi-user systems. * Data is collected from the respondent's perspective and in his or her own words. * Does not force the respondents into any given framework. * Identifies even rare events that might be missed by other methods which only focus on common and everyday events. * Useful when problems occur but the cause and severity are not known. * Inexpensive and provides rich information. * Emphasizes the features that will make a system particularly vulnerable and can bring major benefits (e.g. safety). * Can be applied using questionnaires or interviews. * Easy to understand. =Disadvantages= * A first problem comes from the type of the reported incidents. The Critical Incident Technique will rely on events being remembered by users and will also require the accurate and truthful reporting of them. Since critical incidents often rely on memory, incidents may be imprecise or may even go unreported. * The method has a built-in bias towards incidents that happened recently, since these are easier to recall. * Respondents may not be accustomed to or willing to take the time to tell (or write) a complete story when describing a critical incident. * Since this method is based on incidents it does not say anything about the everyday situation so it is not very representative.

Thus, a bowie knife designed for civilian sale and use may be termed a fighting knife, but not a combat knife, while the U.S. Army's M3 trench knife, designed specifically for the military for close-quarters fighting, is both a combat knife and a fighting knife.Catalog of Standard Ordnance Items, Washington, D.C: U.S. Army Ordnance Publications (1943) Since the end of trench warfare, most military combat knives have been secondarily designed for utility use (clearing foliage, chopping branches for cover, opening ammunition crates, etc.) in addition to their original role as close- quarter combat weapons, and may be referred to as \\"fighting-utility knives.\\" On the other hand, military knives that are intended primarily for use in a role other than combat are typically referred to by their primary role, such as \\"utility knife\\" or \\"survival knife\\". History Daggers designed for military usage in close combat engagements have been carried by soldiers for thousands of years. The adoption of combat daggers made of iron was a significant milestone in combat knife development, and such weapons were highly prized in the ancient armies of the Middle East.Wise, Terence, and McBride, Angus, Ancient Armies of the Middle East, London: Osprey Publishing, (1981), p. 24 French and Italian military daggers of the 14th century were the first to introduce the acutely tapered, sharply pointed and double-edged blade as a response to improvements made in armor design and the need to exploit weaknesses in armor protection. The English and Scandinavians introduced a combat knife known as the \\"bollock dagger\\" into military service around 1350,Walker (1993) p. 28 while the French poignard and the Scottish dirk were daggers designed from the outset as military weapons. The rise in use of firearms led to a decline in the use of combat daggers and knives as military- issue weapons. However, privately purchased knives were often carried by foot soldiers for use both as auxiliary weapons and as utility tools. Some military forces issued knives for individual campaigns or for specialist troops such as pioneer or field engineer detachments, but these cutting tools were not primarily designed for use as combat knives. Modern combat knives Soviet NR 43 Combat Knife Formerly known as a trench knife, the \\"combat knife\\" was used by both sides on the Western front during World War I. Since then, combat knives have been issued by the armies of many nations. Though they differ in detail, they all share the common characteristic of being purposely designed for military use, with their primary role as a close-quarters combat weapon. =World War II= During World War II, the British Fairbairn-Sykes fighting knife was designed by William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes, two former members of the Shanghai Municipal Police who trained many soldiers in close- quarters fighting. The Fairbairn-Sykes knife inspired several similar knives of the era such as the V-42 Stiletto designed by Lt. Colonel Robert T. Frederick who commanded the joint US and Canadian First Special Service Force and the United States Marine Raider Stiletto designed by Lieutenant Colonel Clifford H. Shuey. In the USSR, the Red Army issued combat knives based on a single pattern known as the NR Series. In late 1942, the U.S. Marine Corps adopted the 1219C2, later designated the \\"USMC Mark 2 Combat Knife,\\" but better known in popular terminology as the KA-BAR.Shackleford, Steve (ed.), Blade's Guide To Knives And Their Values (7th ed.), Iola, WI: Krause Publications, , p. 387 The KA-BAR differed from World War I-era U.S. combat knives in that it was designed as a dual-purpose item, adapted for both combat and as a utility knife.Sledge, E.B., With The Old Breed: At Peleleiu and Okinawa, Presidio Press, (2007), pp. 21-22 It differed from earlier USMC knives such as the Marine Raider Stiletto in that the new knife used a stout, wide blade with clip point that facilitated slashing attacks as well as blade thrusts.MCRP 3-02B: Close Combat, Washington, D.C.: Department Of The Navy, Headquarters United States Marine Corps, 12 February 1999: \\"Marines use slashing techniques to close with an enemy. Slashing techniques distract or damage an opponent so Marines can close in.\\" Reports on the effectiveness of the new knife in jungle combat justified the Marine Corps' decision to designate the KA-BAR as the USMC's fighting knife for individual Marines. The U.S. Army adopted the M3 Trench Knife in 1943 as its standard combat knife. The M3 replaced the earlier World War I-vintage Mark I trench knife in combat service. The M3 was a true combat knife, as it was designed solely for military use and was primarily intended as a fighting knife, though some compromises were made in the design to conserve strategic materials.Cassidy, William L. (1997), The Complete Book of Knife Fighting, , (1997), pp. 47-48Whitman, L., New Army Trench Knife, Army & Navy Journal, Vol. 80, 6 February 1943, p. 649 When adapted to utility tasks such as opening ration tins or ammunition boxes, the limitations of the M3 quickly became apparent. In the United States, Bo Randall began production of the \\"All Purpose Fighting Knife\\" giving it the designation of \\"Number 1\\" in his catalog. Between 1942 and 1945, Randall Made Knives produced 4,000 of these knives for battlefield use by US troops, with approximately 1,058 knives additionally subcontracted to Northampton Cutlery Company in Springfield, Massachusetts to meet wartime demand. In the 1950s Randall adopted the general pattern of the Bowie knife for several of his fighting knife designs.Walker(1993) pp. 50-55Pacella (2002)pp. 130-131 =Post-World War II= The majority of military forces today have largely standardized the types of combat knife issued to soldiers. The Chilean Commando forces, for instance, are trained in the use of the Corvo, a traditional Chilean military weapon. The Gurkha regiments favor the kukri, a broad-bladed, curved general-purpose cutting tool and weapon that more closely resembles a machete or Filipino Bolo than a knife. In the United States Marine Corps, the standard issue combat knife since World War II has been the USMC Fighting Utility knife. Designed for military use, with input for Capt. George Ingraham, a combat surgeon in the U.S. Army's 94th Medical Detachment, the No. 14 Randall \\"Attack\\" Model was a popular combat knife designed for military use, and the knife was widely purchased by individual soldiers and Marines. During the conflict, Randall received feedback from Captain Ingraham, who requested serrations on the spine to cut through the fuselage of downed aircraft to rescue trapped personnel and a hollow handle to allow storage of survival gear. Randall made the changes and the result was the first of the modern survival knives. Another combat knife appearing during the Vietnam War was the Gerber Mark II, designed for military use by US Army Captain Bud Holzman and Al Mar which in turn was based on the pattern of a Roman Gladius or short sword. In the 1970s and 1980s a student and prot√©g√© of Fairbairn, Colonel Rex Applegate worked with knife designer Bill Harsey, Jr. to design the Applegate-Fairbairn Combat Knife, so named because it was designed as an improvement on the Fairbairn-Sykes based upon discussions Applegate and Fairbairn had during World War II to eliminate the weaknesses of the F-S knife (e.g., weak blade point, inability to determine orientation of blade merely by grip). The first of these knives were made by Al Mar Knives, based on Harsey's designs.Pacella (2002) p. 145 Knifemaker Bill Harsey later teamed up with Chris Reeve to design the Yarborough Knife, a combat knife presented to each graduate of the United States Army Special Forces Qualification Course. In the latest step of this evolution, Bill Harsey and Chris Reeve have collaborated with the father of the Modern Army Combatives Program, Matt Larsen, to design the LHR Combat knife. The German military uses the Eickhorn KM2000 as their standard issue knife. The design is a westernized Tant≈ç, issued to the Bundeswehr. The blade is made of either 440A or N695 depending on different models. Some of them use 55Si7 spring steel. The knifemaker Eickhorn in Solingen, Germany has issued KCB-77 bayonets to the Canadian Military and the USMC. Apart from the KM2000 there are many other knives from Eickhorn, the KM3000, KM4000, KM5000, ParaCommando, and Aviator Series knives. The knives from Eickhorn are extremely sturdy and for professional use. Those knives are also preferred by military forces worldwide. The Austrian Forces use the Glock knife, a very strong knife. This is also used as a bayonet for the Steyr AUG bullpup rifle used by Austrian Forces. The blade is made of phosphated carbon steel. The handle is a special strong polymer manufactured by Glock. The Glock knife is also used by special forces around the world.

History Fort Chimo and Koksoak River Estuary. USDOD ONC D-15, 1971 The airport site at Fort Chimo was located and surveyed on 12 July 1941 by a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) team under Captain Elliott Roosevelt, operating by amphibious aircraft out of Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador. The chosen site was upstream from the trading post, on the opposite shore. River access was difficult due to shifting, sandy banks and ice and high tides in the estuary. Code-named Crystal I, Fort Chimo was founded on 10 October 1941 by a 12-man weather station and radio communications crew under Antarctic veteran and former Lieutenant Commander, Isaac Schlossbach. Runway construction commenced next summer. The Crystal stations were part of the Crimson East project for trans-Atlantic ferry flights, Chimo being referred to as \\"Bookie\\". Fort Chimo did not actually serve in this intended capacity, but the station was useful for weather reporting, communications, and local support duties. Canada officially took control in 1944, although American crews remained for a period. Seasonal resupply was by United States Coast Guard cutters. Fort Chimo was one of three \\"Crystal\\" sites in the Canadian Arctic, Frobisher Bay Air Base, Northwest Territories (now Iqaluit Airport, Nunavut) being \\"Crystal II\\", and a station on Padloping Island being \\"Crystal III\\". A detachment of the 8th Weather Squadron, Air Transport Command (ATC) took up residence at the station on 1 October 1942.USAFHRA Document 00076387 The initial mission of the Crystal sites was to provide long-range weather information to the combat forces then building up in the United Kingdom. Crystal I was planned to be a transport hub between the Eastern Route, which originated at Presque Isle Air Force Base (now Presque Isle International Airport), Maine and the Central Route, which originated at Romulus Army Airfield (Detroit Airport), Michigan. From Crystal I, the aircraft would be ferried via Baffin Island; Greenland; Iceland and delivered to Scotland. The development of the Mid-Atlantic Transport through the Azores and improved performance of the Gander-Iceland main route led to the cancellation of the Crimson Route project in 1943. The United States presence at Crystal I was reduced to a skeleton weather squadron; which ended in 1945, and the facilities were turned over to the Canadian government.AFHRA Document 00076350 Nav Canada opened a $7-million air traffic control facility near the airport. The radar station allows controllers in Montreal to monitor the steady stream of transatlantic air traffic over northern Quebec. A large-scale terminal expansion project was carried out at the airport between 2006 and 2008. The $14.9 million project included the expansion of the airport apron and the construction of a brand new terminal to replace the cramped building built in 1972. The building, designed by architect Alain Fournier, received a silver certification under the Canadian Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.

Early life Adam Kok The son of Adam Kok II, he was born in Griqualand West. Kok III was educated at the Philippolis Mission School after his family and father's followers moved to the area after disputes with other groups. He was appointed as a member of the Griqua Council at a young age and would act as chief while his father was away. He succeeded his father as the ruler and leader of the Griqua in Philippolis after the death of his father in 1835. His older brother, Abraham, could have taken over as chief but Kok III's political experience impressed the Griqua elders and he was therefore deemed to be the preferred choice to replace his father. Interaction with other groups The Napier Treaty, signed in 1843 between Moshoeshoe I and Adam Kok III - advised and assisted by the missionaries ‚Äì Eugene Cassalis and John Philip on the one hand and the Cape governor Sir George Napier on the other hand ‚Äì recognised the jurisdiction of Moshoeshoe I over his land between Orange River and Caledon River. Napier hoped that this treaty would keep peace in the area so that the British could carry on trading undisturbed. The treaty was immediately opposed by the Wesleyan missionaries and chiefs on the grounds that it took away some of their lands. Kok III would lease some land to the Trekboere and, by 1836, more than 1 500 farmers had already settled in Griqua territory. He then passed a law in 1838 which forbade the sale of leased land to the Trekboere. In 1840, this was modified on condition that the Trekboer would have to recognise Kok III's jurisdiction and authority over the land from the Griquas. Although they were not allowed to sell, the Griquas allowed long leases with Europeans, in some instances longer than 40 years. Griqualand East In 1861, Kok III accepted a British offer to settle his people in the eastern section of the Cape Colony. He then led his people on a two-year trek across South Africa. During the trek, the Griqua lost most of their cattle and horses as they suffered through droughts and raids by the Basotho. In February 1863, they crossed the Drakensberg at Ongeluks Nek and descended along the banks of the Kenigha River on to Mount Currie (then known as Berg Vyftig) where they founded Griqualand East. After settling down they worked on replenishing their herds and flocks. They also built structures using bricks and succeeded in setting up an efficient method of government and a legislature. They raised their revenue through tax, trading licenses and fines. In 1867, they printed their own currency, which, however, was only used in their jurisdiction. These coins and notes never reached full circulation and payments for levies were usually made in cattle, goats, sheep and grain. In 1874, Kok III assisted the British in a campaign to subdue the Hlubi people in Natal. That same year, the Cape Colony placed Griqualand East under custodial government, effectively deposing Kok III. Death Kok III died without an heir on 30 December 1875 after being injured in a wagon accident. The Cape Colony formerly annexed Griqualand East in 1877 after the passing of the Griqualand East Annexation Act (Act 38 of 1877). The act was only promulgated on 17 September 1879, when four magistrates were set up, at Kokstad, Matatiele, Mount Frere and Umzimkhulu.

It is housed in the National Gallery of Art of Washington, D.C., United States. Bindo Altoviti was a rich banker born in Rome in 1491 of Florentine origin. He was a cultured man who liked the arts. The graceful, almost effeminate position of the subject along with the heavy contrast between light and shadow are atypical of Raphael's work, particularly of his portraits of men, demonstrating the artist's experimentation with different styles and forms in his later Roman period. The influence of the works of Leonardo, which Raphael studied astutely during this period of his career, is strikingly evident in this particular piece. The painting was a property of Altoviti's descendants until 1808, when it was sold to Ludwig I of Bavaria. It remained at the Alte Pinakothek until 1936, when, after many debates about its attribution, the painting was lured out of Nazi Germany by \\"canny English dealers\\". Acquired by Samuel Henry Kress, the portrait subsequently became property of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.. A bronze bust of Altoviti by Benvenuto Cellini is exhibited in Boston at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. References  Further reading  * *David Brown and Jane Van Nimmen.

Religious literature The earliest datable text in Manx (preserved in 18th century manuscripts), a poetic history of the Isle of Man from the introduction of Christianity, dates to the 16th century at the latest. Christianity has been an overwhelming influence on Manx literature. Religious literature was common, but surviving secular writing much rarer. The New Testament was first published in 1767. The Book of Common Prayer and Bible were translated into Manx and published in 1610 and again in 1765. The first Manx Bible was printed between 1771 and 1775 and is the source and standard for modern Manx orthography. It was a collective translation undertaken by most the Manx clergy under the editorship of Philip Moore. Further editions followed in 1777 and a revised edition by the British and Foreign Bible Society 1819. A tradition of , religious songs or carols, developed, probably with its roots in the pre-Reformation period. Until the 18th century, the authors of were generally clergy, but in the 19th century new words would be put to popular tunes for use in churches and chapels. The first printed work in Manx, , dates from 1707: a translation of a Prayer Book catechism in English by Bishop Thomas Wilson. Pargys Caillit was an abridged Manx version of Paradise Lost by John Milton published in 1796 by Thomas Christian, vicar of Marown 1780-1799.  19th century  Edward Faragher, (, 1831‚Äì1908) of Cregneash has been considered the last important native writer of Manx. From the age of 26, he wrote poetry, often on religious subjects, some of which were printed in the Mona's Herald and the Cork Eagle. Some of his stories are reminiscences of his life as a fisherman, and , translations of selected Aesop's Fables, was published in 1901. Many traditional Manx language songs and ballads were collected by the antiquarian and historian A. W. Moore and published in his Manx Carols (1891) and Manx Ballads and Music (1896).  Modern literature  Yn √áheshaght Ghailckagh (the Manx Language Society) was worked closed with Culture Vannin in the publication of Manx language literature.

The city is located at the geographic center of the province at the confluence of national and provincial roads, on a route to the Andes and Chile. The city hosts a Loma Negra cement plant. Zapala is near the Laguna Blanca National Park and a ski resort and is situated in a steppe region, known as Pehuenia, which has small Araucaria forests and includes the nearby town of Alumin√© and other towns.  History  Zapala was founded on 12 July 1913, and turned into a municipality in 1948. It was (and still is) located around a railway station built by the Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway, a British-owned company taken over by the Ferrocarril General Roca after railway nationalisation in 1948 and, since railway privatisation in 1993, in the hands of Ferrosur Roca. The city is split in two by the railways; on one side there is a commercial district with old buildings, and on the other a modern residential area. The station is a terminus at the end of the line from Bah√≠a Blanca and Neuqu√©n which was meant to continue across the Andes mountains into Chile. Construction was abandoned in the 1920s although resumption of construction was proposed in 2006. In 1918 Zapala was the starting point of the first flight by an airplane across the Andes, when Luis Candelaria flew to Cunco, Chile, on April 13. It is served by Zapala Airport.

It takes an interdisciplinary point of view by analyzing the works of authors, researchers and poets in the context of environmental issues and nature. Some ecocritics brainstorm possible solutions for the correction of the contemporary environmental situation, though not all ecocritics agree on the purpose, methodology, or scope of ecocriticism. In the United States, ecocriticism is often associated with the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment (ASLE),Glotfelty & Fromm 1996, p. xviii which hosts a biennial conference for scholars who deal with environmental matters in literature and the environmental humanities in general. ASLE publishes a journal‚ÄîInterdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment (ISLE)‚Äîin which current international scholarship can be found. Ecocriticism is an intentionally broad approach that is known by a number of other designations, including \\"green (cultural) studies\\", \\"ecopoetics\\", and \\"environmental literary criticism\\", and is often informed by other fields such as ecology, sustainable design, biopolitics, environmental history, environmentalism, and social ecology, among others.  Definition  In comparison with other 'political' forms of criticism, there has been relatively little dispute about the moral and philosophical aims of ecocriticism, although its scope has broadened from nature writing, romantic poetry, and canonical literature to take in film, television, theatre, animal stories, architectures, scientific narratives and an extraordinary range of literary texts. At the same time, ecocriticism has borrowed methodologies and theoretically informed approaches liberally from other fields of literary, social and scientific study. Cheryll Glotfelty's working definition in The Ecocriticism Reader is that \\"ecocriticism is the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment\\", and one of the implicit goals of the approach is to recoup professional dignity for what Glotfelty calls the \\"undervalued genre of nature writing\\".Glotfelty & Fromm 1996, p. xxxi Lawrence Buell defines \\"'ecocriticism' ... as [a] study of the relationship between literature and the environment conducted in a spirit of commitment to environmentalist praxis\\".430, n.20 Simon Estok noted in 2001 that \\"ecocriticism has distinguished itself, debates notwithstanding, firstly by the ethical stand it takes, its commitment to the natural world as an important thing rather than simply as an object of thematic study, and, secondly, by its commitment to making connections\\".Estok 2001, p. 220 More recently, in an article that extends ecocriticism to Shakespearean studies, Estok argues that ecocriticism is more than \\"simply the study of Nature or natural things in literature; rather, it is any theory that is committed to effecting change by analyzing the function‚Äìthematic, artistic, social, historical, ideological, theoretical, or otherwise‚Äìof the natural environment, or aspects of it, represented in documents (literary or other) that contribute to material practices in material worlds\\".Estok 2005, pp. 16-17 This echoes the functional approach of the cultural ecology branch of ecocriticism, which analyzes the analogies between ecosystems and imaginative texts and posits that such texts potentially have an ecological (regenerative, revitalizing) function in the cultural system.Zapf 2008 As Michael P. Cohen has observed, \\"if you want to be an ecocritic, be prepared to explain what you do and be criticized, if not satirized.\\" Certainly, Cohen adds his voice to such critique, noting that one of the problems of ecocriticism has been what he calls its \\"praise-song school\\" of criticism. All ecocritics share an environmentalist motivation of some sort, but whereas the majority are 'nature endorsing',Kate Soper, \\"What is Nature?\\", 1998 some are 'nature sceptical'. In part this entails a shared sense of the ways in which 'nature' has been used to legitimize gender, sexual and racial norms (so homosexuality has been seen as 'unnatural', for example), but it also involves scepticism about the uses to which 'ecological' language is put in ecocriticism; it can also involve a critique of the ways cultural norms of nature and the environment contribute to environmental degradation. Greg Garrard has dubbed 'pastoral ecology' the notion that nature undisturbed is balanced and harmonious,Barry 2009, pp. 56-58 while Dana Phillips has criticised the literary quality and scientific accuracy of nature writing in \\"The Truth of Ecology\\". Similarly, there has been a call to recognize the place of the Environmental Justice movement in redefining ecocritical discourse.Buell 1998 In response to the question of what ecocriticism is or should be, Camilo Gomides has offered an operational definition that is both broad and discriminating: \\"The field of enquiry that analyzes and promotes works of art which raise moral questions about human interactions with nature, while also motivating audiences to live within a limit that will be binding over generations\\". He tests it for a film adaptation about Amazonian deforestation. Implementing the Gomides definition, Joseph Henry Vogel makes the case that ecocriticism constitutes an \\"economic school of thought\\" as it engages audiences to debate issues of resource allocation that have no technical solution. Ashton Nichols has recently argued that the historical dangers of a romantic version of nature now need to be replaced by \\"urbanatural roosting\\", a view that sees urban life and the natural world as closely linked and argues for humans to live more lightly on the planet, the way virtually all other species do. In literary studies Ecocritics investigate such things as the underlying ecological values, what, precisely, is meant by the word nature, and whether the examination of \\"place\\" should be a distinctive category, much like class, gender or race. Ecocritics examine human perception of wilderness, and how it has changed throughout history and whether or not current environmental issues are accurately represented or even mentioned in popular culture and modern literature. Scholars in ecocriticism engage in questions regarding anthropocentrism, and the \\"mainstream assumption that the natural world be seen primarily as a resource for human beings\\" as well as critical approaches to changing ideas in \\"the material and cultural bases of modern society.\\" Recently, \\"empirical ecocritics\\" have begun empirically evaluating the influence of ecofiction on its readers. Other disciplines, such as history, economics, philosophy, ethics, and psychology, are also considered by ecocritics to be possible contributors to ecocriticism. While William Rueckert may have been the first person to use the term ecocriticism (Barry 240) in his 1978 essay entitled Literature and Ecology: An Experiment in Ecocriticism, ecocriticism as a movement owes much to Rachel Carson's 1962 environmental expos√© Silent Spring. Drawing from this critical moment, Rueckert's intent was to focus on \\"the application of ecology and ecological concepts to the study of literature\\".Glotfelty & Fromm 1996, p. 107 Ecologically minded individuals and scholars have been publishing progressive works of ecotheory and criticism since the explosion of environmentalism in the late 1960s and 1970s. However, because there was no organized movement to study the ecological/environmental side of literature, these important works were scattered and categorized under a litany of different subject headings: pastoralism, human ecology, regionalism, American Studies etc. British marxist critic Raymond Williams, for example, wrote a seminal critique of pastoral literature in 1973, The Country and the City. Another early ecocritical text, Joseph Meeker's The Comedy of Survival (1974), proposed a version of an argument that was later to dominate ecocriticism and environmental philosophy; that environmental crisis is caused primarily by a cultural tradition in the West of separation of culture from nature, and elevation of the former to moral predominance. Such anthropocentrism is identified in the tragic conception of a hero whose moral struggles are more important than mere biological survival, whereas the science of animal ethology, Meeker asserts, shows that a \\"comic mode\\" of muddling through and \\"making love not war\\" has superior ecological value. In the later, \\"second wave\\" ecocriticism, Meeker's adoption of an ecophilosophical position with apparent scientific sanction as a measure of literary value tended to prevail over Williams's ideological and historical critique of the shifts in a literary genre's representation of nature. As Glotfelty noted in The Ecocriticism Reader, \\"One indication of the disunity of the early efforts is that these critics rarely cited one another's work; they didn't know that it existed...Each was a single voice howling in the wilderness.\\"Glotfelty & Fromm 1996, p. vii Nevertheless, ecocriticism‚Äîunlike feminist and Marxist criticisms‚Äîfailed to crystallize into a coherent movement in the late 1970s, and indeed only did so in the US in the 1990s. In the mid-1980s, scholars began to work collectively to establish ecocriticism as a genre, primarily through the work of the Western Literature Association in which the revaluation of nature writing as a non-fictional literary genre could function. During the late-1980s poet Jack Collom was awarded a 2nd National Endowment for the Arts grant, for his ground-breaking work in this emerging genre. Collom taught an influential Eco-Lit course at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado for nearly two decades. In 1990, at the University of Nevada, Reno, Glotfelty became the first person to hold an academic position as a professor of Literature and the Environment, and UNR, with the aid of the now-retired Glotfelty and the remaining professor Michael P. Branch, has retained the position it established at that time as the intellectual home of ecocriticism even as ASLE has burgeoned into an organization with thousands of members in the US alone. From the late 1990s, new branches of ASLE and affiliated organizations were started in the UK, Japan, Korea, Australia and New Zealand (ASLEC-ANZ), India (OSLE-India), Southeast Asia (ASLE-ASEAN), Taiwan, Canada and Europe. The emergence of ecocriticism in British literary criticism is usually dated to the publication in 1991 of Romantic Ecology: Wordsworth and the Environmental Tradition by Jonathan Bate.

Together with the entirely rural hamlet of Weethley, it forms since 2004 the civil parish of Arrow with Weethley. The parish lies midway between Redditch and Evesham. From Alcester the River Arrow flows southwards to the Avon, and to the west of the river the present road to Evesham joins that to Worcester at a busy junction where, near the Old Toll House, stands the hamlet of Arrow, a group of modernized black and white farm workers' cottages which have risen up the social scale to become homes for business people. History In 710, according to the chronicles of the abbey of Evesham, Ceolred, King of Mercia, gave land in ARROW to the abbey. It was subsequently wrested from them but regained by Abbot Agelwy II (1070‚Äì7), only to be lost again to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, (fn. 15) who at the time of the Domesday Survey held 7¬Ω hidesFrom: 'Parishes: Arrow', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 26‚Äì31. Date accessed: 6 February 2011 Arrow Mill was mentioned in the Domesday Book and is now a hotel and restaurant as well as a working water mill. =Manors= There were originally three manors, Arrow Manor, Ragley Manor and Oversley Manor. In the 12th century William de Camville of Clifton, Staffordshire, acquired the manor of Arrow through his marriage and it remained in that family and its cadets until about 1500 when it passed by marriage to Sir Hugh Conway, Knt. In the 17th century it became united through this family with Ragley Manor. The latter was held in 1370 by Sir John Rous, Knt. In October 1591 it was sold to Sir John Conway. Thereafter Ragley became the principal seat of the Conway family in the 17th century and follows the same descent as the manor of Arrow. In the village are the gates to Ragley Hall which has been home to the Marquess of Hertford's family since the mid-18th century.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol3/pp26-31 At the Domesday Survey, the Count of Meulan, later created Earl of Leicester, held 3 hides of land in Oversley, and until the close of the Middle Ages the manor remained part of the honour of Leicester. In 1086 Fulk held the estate, but it later passed to one of the second Earl of Leicester's officials, Ralph le Boteler, who built a castle, or more likely wooden stockade, there, making it his principal seat. In the middle of the 12th century the Earl and Ralph jointly founded the monastery of Alcester, and granted to it lands in Oversley, in 1140. On the death of William le Boteler in 1369 without male heirs the manor passed to his daughter Elizabeth, wife of Sir Robert Ferrers, Knt. In 1482 Oversley passed to Sir William Gascoigne of Gawthorpe, Yorkshire. In 1537 Sir William Gascoigne and his son Sir Henry sold the manor to Sir Thomas Cromwell. After Cromwell's attainder Henry VIII granted Oversley, in exchange for lands in Bedfordshire, to Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton, Knt., who had been anxious to acquire it for several years. From this time the manor follows the same descent as Coughton. Oversley was a valuable and extensive manor, comprising also, in 1566, the present parishes of Exhall and Wixford, part of Grafton and part, at least, of King's Broom.https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol3/pp26-31 Charles Turberville (1767‚Äì1811), of the ancient Anglo-Norman family, was farming at Oversley when he married at Alcester in October 1791.Old Parish Registers for St.Nicholas, Alcester, in Warwick Country Record Office. He is buried at Arrow.Old Parish Registers. =Church= The parish church of the Holy Trinity consists of a chancel with a north chapel and vestry, nave, north aisle, and west tower. The building dates from the 12th century, but the only evidence of this period is the south doorway, which may have been reset at a later period. The nave has windows of the end of the 13th century, and the chancel appears to have been rebuilt from early-to mid-14th century. The west tower is said to have been added or rebuilt in 1767. In the tower is one bell by Henry Bagley, 1657. The north aisle was added in 1865 and the rest of the building restored. The nave (49 ft. by 20 ft.) has a north arcade of three bays. In the south wall are three windows: the easternmost dating from about 1300. The west wall has a Tudor doorway. There are several tombs within the church of the Conway family, for centuries Lords of the Manor here, including Henege, an infant son of Edward, Viscount Conway, who died in 1660. In the village church is a statue of one of the Marquesses sculpted by Prince Victor of Hohenlohe- Langenburg, a nephew of Queen Victoria.https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol3/pp26-31 There is a churchyard (graveyard) surrounding the church.

He was the satrap (governor) of Caria for the Persian Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II (404-358 BC). However, the basis for Hecatomnus' political power was twofold: he was both a high appointed Persian official and a powerful local dynast, who founded the hereditary dynasty of the Hecatomnids. The Hecatomnids followed the earlier autochthonous dynasty of the Lygdamids (520-450 BC) in Caria. Biography Hecatomnus was the son and successor of Hyssaldomus, a dynastic ruler of Mylasa. It is likely that Hecatomnus had been a supporter of Tissaphernes and might have been employed by him in the subordinate office of hyparch.Ruzicka, pp. 18-19 At some time after 395 BC Tissaphernes who was satrap of Lydia and Caria was executed in 395. Hecatomnus became the first satrap of Caria, which was until then part of other satrapies, usually that of Lydia. The designation of Caria as a separate satrapy was part of a reorganization of Persian power in western Anatolia by Artaxerxes II in the aftermath of Cyrus's revolt. Hecatomnus was the first non-Persian official to be elevated to the position of satrap. He acceded as satrap perhaps in 394 BC,John Hazel, Who's Who in the Greek World, p. 110 but no later than 390 BC,Susan M. Sherwin-White, Ancient Cos, 1978, p. 41 when he was appointed by the Persian king to command the naval forces destined to take part in the war against Evagoras I of Cyprus. Isocrates states that he was still ruling in 380 BC. Stephen Ruzicka places his death in 377/376 BC Ruzicka, p. 29 He left three sons, Mausolus, Idrieus and Pixodarus, and two daughters, Artemisia and Ada, who were married to their brothers, Mausolus and Idrieus, all five of whom in turn succeeded him as rulers. Alleged collusion with Evagoras Hecatomnus coin, with legend EKATOMNŒ©. Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology. Two ancient sources, Diodorus and Isocrates, report that Hecatomnus secretly supplied Evagoras with sums of money to raise mercenary troops and was in fact ready to rise against the Persian King. However, Ruzicka strongly doubts the veracity of these reports.Ruzicka, p.27 Indeed, Hecatomnus had not shown at any other time insubordination or disaffection towards the Persian monarchy. Unlike other rebellious satraps (Cyrus the Younger or Pissuthnes, for example) Hecatomnus was not a Persian of noble or royal blood and could not hope to win the allegiance of other Persian officials. Thus, it seems highly unlikely that he would have engaged in treasonous activity without any tangible hope to benefit from it. Ruzicka offers two possible explanations for the reports by Diodorus and Isocrates, which must have been based on some contemporary rumours. In both cases he names Evagoras as the likely source of the rumours. (i) Evagoras might have wanted to compromise Hecatomnus in the eyes of his master, Artaxerxes. Later, he managed to engineer the recall and disgrace of another satrap (Orontes) who was campaigning against him.Ruzicka, p. 27 (ii) Evagoras might have wanted to create the impression that Hecatomnus was his secret ally in order to impress the Egyptian king Hakor with whom he was negotiating for support against Artaxerxes. From Egypt the rumour could have filtered to Athens through the Athenian general Chabrias who was then serving with Hakor as a military adviser.Ruzicka, p.28 Coinage Coinage of Hekatomnos, with effigy of the Satrap. Circa 392/1-377/6 BC. Hecatomnus was a native of Mylasa, and made that city his capital and the seat of his government.

After Napoleon's final defeat he served in the national army of Poland, and served in the Imperial Russian Army under Hans Karl von Diebitsch against the Ottoman Empire in 1828/29. He was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Order of Virtuti Militari. Chrzanowski was born on 14 January 1793 in Biskupice. He was made Governor of Warsaw in 1831. He was suspected of being untrustworthy in his conduct with the Russians and was shunned by many of the people, emigrating to Paris at the end of 1831. In 1841 he was in the service of the British government. Lord Palmerston sent him to assist the Ottoman military reforms, acting as a British military attach√© in the field. Charles Albert, King of Sardinia, called Chrzanowski after the armistice that concluded the 1848 campaign of the First Italian War of Independence as Chief of Staff of the Piedmontese army; this caused friction in the ranks, as he was largely seen as the King's creature, and his figure and attitude did not command much respect. After Eusebio Bava was removed as General in Chief, he was officially named Generale maggiore (Major general, not a rank but a title for the head of staff) for the upcoming campaign (although de facto he would lead the army). The 1849 campaign was however a complete insuccess, as he was outmaneuvered and defeated by Josef Radetzky in the Battle of Novara. General Girolamo Ramorino was blamed for the defeat, and subsequently executed; however Chrzanowski did not escape censure and was dismissed from Sardinian service. He lived for a time in Louisiana but died in Paris (26 February 1861). He published several works in Polish.

CNet gave a positive review scoring 3.5/5 suggesting it was good both for professionals and those looking for fun features. A supposed 'killer app' feature of the D600 that has been the routine subject of critical review is the phone's poor visual TV out quality. Other criticisms of the model include: * The phone can't be set to vibrate and ring at the same time, however it can be set to vibrate and then ring. * The MP3 Player does not work in background. * Java MIDlets can only be downloaded using GPRS via an online server, such as http://www.waphq.net which, although a free service still involves the service cost of the bandwidth to download. It is NOT officially possible to install Java MIDlets on the D600 via Bluetooth, IrDa, USB or Serial Cable. * The D600 does not support JSR 75 and has a relatively small RMS space despite having over 80MB of on-board memory. * The Text message ring tone is limited to the limited built in list. * Depending on the phone's firmware it does not support MicroSD-Cards larger than 1 GB. Hacks The D600 has several hacks that can be used to overcome some of the shortcoming of the firmware shipped with the phone. Most of them will invalidate the warranty and may violate any network agreements. * It is possible to use the USB cable or Bluetooth to download Java Midlets to the phone by using engineer codes and 3rd party software see this Tutorial. * There have been several versions of modified firmware available for the D600, most of them addressing the shortcomings of the firmware shipped with the phone such as the selection of message tones, background music playing and automatic sms message saving.

Firms need to acquire capital from others to operate and grow. Individuals and organizations who are willing to provide their funds to others naturally desire to be rewarded. Just as landlords seek rents on their property, capital providers seek returns on their funds, which must be commensurate with the risk undertaken. Firms obtain capital from two kinds of sources: lenders and equity investors. From the perspective of capital providers, lenders seek to be rewarded with interest and equity investors seek dividends and/or appreciation in the value of their investment (capital gain). From a firm's perspective, they must pay for the capital it obtains from others, which is called its cost of capital. Such costs are separated into a firm's cost of debt and cost of equity and attributed to these two kinds of capital sources. While a firm's present cost of debt is relatively easy to determine from observation of interest rates in the capital markets, its current cost of equity is unobservable and must be estimated. Finance theory and practice offers various models for estimating a particular firm's cost of equity such as the capital asset pricing model, or CAPM. Another method is derived from the Gordon Model, which is a discounted cash flow model based on dividend returns and eventual capital return from the sale of the investment. Another simple method is the Bond Yield Plus Risk Premium (BYPRP), where a subjective risk premium is added to the firm's long-term debt interest rate. In addition, the cost of equity can be calculated by (proposed by Gebhardt et.al. (2001) - see Further Reading Section) using the discounted residual income model to estimate the market implied cost-of-capital. The paper shows that a firm‚Äôs implied cost-of-capital is a function of its industry membership, B/M ratio, forecasted long-term growth rate, and the dispersion in analyst earnings forecasts. Moreover, a firm's overall cost of capital, which consists of the two types of capital costs, can be estimated using the weighted average cost of capital model. According to finance theory, as a firm's risk increases/decreases, its cost of capital increases/decreases. This theory is linked to observation of human behavior and logic: capital providers expect reward for offering their funds to others. Such providers are usually rational and prudent preferring safety over risk. They naturally require an extra reward as an incentive to place their capital in a riskier investment instead of a safer one. If an investment's risk increases, capital providers demand higher returns or they will place their capital elsewhere. Knowing a firm's cost of capital is needed in order to make better decisions. Managers make capital budgeting decisions while capital providers make decisions about lending and investment. Such decisions can be made after quantitative analysis that typically uses a firm's cost of capital as a model input.

Origins of the parish The village was sometimes spelt 'Alestry'.The Birmingham and Midland Society for Genealogy and Heraldry: Austrey In the Saxon era Austrey formed part of a great block of seventy or eighty midland vills belonging to Wulfric Spot, the Mercian nobleman who founded Burton Abbey. In Wulfric Spot's will of 1004 Wulfric left Austrey \\"as it now stands with meat and with men\\", to one of his thegns who later transferred this part of the vill to the abbey. After the Norman conquest of England the abbot was forced to share suzerainty with Nigel d'Aubigny, one of the Conqueror's trusted retinue, who was given lands in the parish as part of the spoils of the English defeat. Although he retained two and a half hides in Austrey, the abbot was no longer the principal landowner in the parish. Domesday Book of 1086 records 42 inhabitants in the town. The monks of Burton took advantage of rising wool prices in the medieval period to sublet their estates for sheep walks. Aubigny lands reverted to Burton Abbey. In 1538 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Abbey surrendered its lands to the Crown.Salzman, 1947, pages 9‚Äì13 In 1541 the abbey was refounded as a collegiate church and Austrey manor was restored to it. However, in 1545 the collegiate church was dissolved and in 1546 the Crown granted Austrey manor to Sir William Paget. His son Henry Paget inherited Austrey manor in 1563 and still owned it in 1587. Thereafter the manor was divided into freehold farms that were sold to the wealthier tenants. One of the Austrey manors came into the possession of the Kendalls of Smithsby through marriage with one of Henry Alstre's co-heiresses in 1433. The Kendalls were well-established in Austrey by 1550 and they continued to consolidate their position after this date. The other Austrey manor held by Sir Walter Aston was broken up and divided among his tenants in the early 17th century. By the Tudor period the village was divided into two separate parts: the original settlement cluster around the church and market cross at Over End and a later extension at Nether End. The Kendalls, hereditary lords of the manor, declared support for Parliament at the outbreak of the Civil War and became involved with conventicles and dissent in the latter half of the 17th century. Henry Kendall was governor of the parliamentary garrison at Maxstoke from March 1644 to October 1645. The parish provided free quartering for a considerable force of parliamentarians commanded by Colonel Drummond and Sir Thomas Fairfax in 1646. It is the namesake of Austrey School, Karachi, Pakistan. Parish church Austrey had a parish church by 1155. The oldest part of the present Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas is the Early English Gothic tower,Pevsner & Wedgwood, 1966, page 79 which was built in the middle of the 13th century. The remainder of the church was rebuilt early in the 14th century in the Decorated Gothic style. The nave has a clerestory and is flanked by north and south aisles, each of four bays. The Gothic Revival architect Ewan Christian restored the chancel with new windows in 1844‚Äì45. The bell-tower has a ring of five bells. Three including the tenor were cast by Hugh Watts II of Leicester in 1632. Another was cast by Thomas Rudhall of Gloucester in 1770. The treble was recast by James Barwell of Birmingham in 1911 from another 1632 bell by Hugh Watts. The original church had a leaded roof with castellated wall. Drawings of the church in the pre- Victorian format are held by Birmingham Central Library. In the Victorian era the current pitched roof replaced the original and the porch was added. St. Nicholas' parish is now part of the Parish of All Souls, North Warwickshire along with the villages of Newton Regis, Seckington, Shuttington and Warton.All Souls ‚Äì North Warwickshire Parish Web site Settlement The line of earthworks below the church in the area known as the Bishop's Field are part of a complex of water management ducts and ponds with this area used as water meadows. A quote from George Barwell of Shuttington in 1790 :- \\"in the parish of Austrey where he was born it has been the custom ever since he can remember (sixty years) to throw the rich waters which are collected in rainy seasons on the common fields lying on the side of the hill above the village, over the meadows which are below it, by means of floodgates and floating trenches.\\" Also in the Bishops Field is a natural spring known as the holy well. The new settlement at the Nether End probably originated with Earl Leofric's original grant to Burton Abbey, which would account for the siting of the monks' farmstead at nearby Bishop's Farm. The medieval pattern of settlement was scythe-shaped with tenements lining the main street running roughly parallel to the ridgeway from Orton to No man's heath. The earliest record of the customary tenants on Sir William Paget's demesne in Tudor times is a partial list of the Austrey copyholders with the number of virgates held by each from a surviving manor court roll. (Paget Court Roll 1646 D(W)1734/J2009 in Staffordshire Record Office All but two of the twelve tenants listed on the demesne in 1546 held a single virgate; one (Richard Cryspe) had a quarter and the other (Elizabeth Clerke) two virgates. Most of these family names are listed in the 17th century attached to Austrey farmers or craftsmen paying for a single hearth in the hearth tax returns. The two ends of the village had separate water treatment reed beds on the streams just outside the village ‚Äì the area behind the current sewage pumping system at the South West corner of the village is still owned by Severn Trent Water.

As well as telling the story of an iconic man in the field of war photography, the film addresses the broader scope of ideas common to all those involved in war journalism, as well as the issues that they cover. The documentary won a 2003 Peabody Award, and was nominated for an Academy Award in 2002 and an Emmy Award in 2004. It also won or was nominated for more than 40 other awards internationally.http://www.war-photographer.com/en (follow the \\"Festivals and Awards\\" link). Page accessed June 21, 2012.  Synopsis  One of the main themes of the documentary is the level to which a journalist should become involved in the events that they are there to document. James Nachtwey credits the intimacy of his photography to his emphasis on establishing a rapport with his subjects, often despite a significant language barrier. Des Wright, a cameraman with Reuters, describes the problem of being too far removed from what is happening. Discussing a video reel of President Suharto's resignation and a police crackdown on protestors, he notes: \\"[Some journalists] say, 'I'm sorry, I'm a journalist, I'm not a part of this.' And I say, but you are a part of it. I think a lot of people would be quite happy for that man to be killed so they can get the particular picture that they want.\\" The documentary uses footage filmed with a small \\"microcam\\" video camera mounted on Nachtwey's SLR cameras. This allows the viewer to see the events from the perspective of the photographer. = Events and locations depicted in the film = * Post-war Kosovo * Poverty and riots in Jakarta, Indonesia * Ramallah, the West Bank * A sulfur mine at Ijen in East Java, Indonesia * New York City, New York, United States * Hamburg, Germany * Thokoza, South Africa Awards *2003 Peabody Award *Nominated for an Academy Award, 2002 *Nominated for an Emmy Award, 2004  Reception  Edward Guthmann from the San Francisco Chronicle has emphasized that the film appeals to the spectators‚Äô sense for compassion: Ken Fox has estimated the humanistic approach of the film and of the work of James Nachtwey: Similar Peter Rainer from New York:  Notes   External links  2001 films 2001 documentary films Swiss films English-language films German-language films Swiss documentary films Films shot in Indonesia Films directed by Christian Frei Documentary films about war photographers ","title":"War Photographer"},{"id":"2943450","text":"Maud Forget born May 7, 1982 is a French actress best known for her roles in \\"Mauvaises fr√©quentations\\" (1999, \\"Bad Company\\"), and \\"La vie promise\\" (2002, \\"Ghost River\\"/\\"The Promised Life\\") opposite Isabelle Huppert and Pascal Greggory.

However, there is one full biography of Dale: see McLaren, D. J. (2015). David Dale: A Life. Catrine: Stenlake Publishing Ltd. He was a successful entrepreneur in a number of areas, most notably in the cotton-spinning industry and was the founder of the world famous cotton mills in New Lanark, where he provided social and educational conditions far in advance of anything available anywhere else in the UK. Scotland‚Äôs leading historian, Professor Sir Tom Devine, described Dale as ‚Äòthe greatest cotton magnate of his time in Scotland‚Äô. New Lanark attracted visitors from all over the world. Dale‚Äôs daughter (Caroline) married Robert Owen in 1799 and by 1800, Dale had sold the mills to a group of businessmen led by Robert Owen. Owen (often described as Utopian Socialist) saw New Lanark as a testing ground for what he called his New Social System ‚Äì an experiment in communitarian living, where education was the key to character formation. He managed New Lanark for nearly 25 years, and the community continued to attract visitors from across the globe.There are many biographies of Owen. See, for example, Donnachie, I. (2015). Robert Owen, Social Visionary. 2nd edition. Edinburgh University Press; Podmore, F. (1906) Robert Owen ‚Äì A Biography. London: Hutchinson & Co. See also Claeys, G. (1993) The Selected Works of Robert Owen. Pickering and Chatto. Owen‚Äôs autobiography (Life of Robert Owen by Himself), written in 1857, requires caution as his recollections were not always accurate. Early career David Dale was born in Stewarton, Ayrshire in 1739, son of William Dale, a general dealer in the village. His date of birth is normally given as 6 January but there is no officially recorded date of birth.National Records of Scotland indicate 1 January but, in the absence of parish documentation, this is simply a computer default date. However, parish records show that he was baptised on 14 January 1739. As a child, he worked with the cattle as a ‚Äòherd laddie‚Äô in very basic conditions. This was the period of run rigs and impoverished tenant farmers ‚Äì all before the so-called Age of Improvement. Dale‚Äôs family was not wealthy, but he did not experience the absolute poverty and near starvation of many of those involved in tenant farming. His father apprenticed him to a handloom weaver in Paisley and he then became an agent in Hamilton and, later, Cambuslang ‚Äì putting out yarn to be woven and collecting the finished cloth. He arrived in Glasgow in around 1763 as a clerk to a silk merchant and began his own small business in the High Street, importing linen yarns from France and the Netherlands. The business grew rapidly and Dale became a wealthy merchant in the city. In 1777, at the age of 38, he married 24 year old Anne Caroline (Carolina) Campbell, whose late father had been the Chief Executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland. A wealthy merchant needed a suitable house and in 1783 Dale had a grand mansion built in Glasgow‚Äôs fashionable Charlotte Street. The couple were together for 14 years until the untimely death of Carolina. During that period, she bore him nine children, four of whom, including their only son, died in infancy. Their first born ‚Äì also named Anne Caroline ‚Äì later became Mrs Robert Owen. Pivotal Years 409x409pxThe period 1783-1785 saw Dale‚Äôs career take off in a number of directions. By 1785 he was no longer a city merchant but a budding entrepreneur, banker and industrialist. In 1783 he joined Edinburgh businessman Robert Scott Moncrieff in setting up the first Glasgow agency of the Royal Bank of Scotland ‚Äì undoubtedly a business arrangement much assisted by his wife‚Äôs family connections. Within a few years, the Glasgow branch was doing business worth a staggering one million pounds. America was no longer a British colony and Glasgow merchants no longer depended on tobacco for their fortunes. Textiles, sugar and rum were the new tobacco. In 1783, there was an opportunity for Dale to extend his reputation and influence with the establishment of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, the first of its type in Britain. Dale became a Director (later Deputy Chairman) and joined forces with the likes of James Oswald, James Dennistoun, John Glassford, Thomas Buchanan and many others ‚Äì ex tobacco lords, sugar & rum merchants, textile merchants and entrepreneurs from the coal, chemical and brewing industries. Dale became an important figure in the commercial life of Glasgow and remained an influential figure in Chamber until his death. According to one source, Dale by this time had become: > ...the prosperous Glasgow merchant who, by virtue of pure force of character > and intelligence, had fairly broken down that wall of distinction which once > separated him from the great tobacco and sugar lords and could now wear his > cocked hat jauntily, display his silver knee buckles showily and take the > place of honour on the crown of the causeway with the proudest of them all. Crucial to the Dale story is Richard Arkwright‚Äôs visit to Scotland in 1784 at the request of George Dempster, landowner and Perthshire M.P. Dempster was trying to provide employment for large number of people who were forced to emigrate from the Highlands to find work ‚Äì a concern which Dale shared. 273x273px Arkwright, owner of the several successful cotton mills in England, acknowledged as the father of the cotton industry and one of the richest men in Britain, was persuaded to visit Lanark, with a view to establishing a cotton mill in the area. David Dale and George Dempster accompanied Arkwright as they walked down the hill to where New Lanark is today. The site was considered to be suitable and a partnership was agreed between the three of them. Work began soon on what was to become arguably the most important cotton-spinning community in Europe. New Lanark Construction work began immediately and the mill buildings were based on Arkwright‚Äôs own mills in Cromford. Men and boys were sent from New Lanark to Cromford for initial training and the mills began spinning in early 1786, at which point both Dempster and Arkwright left the partnership, leaving Dale as the sole owner. By the 1790s there were nearly 1,400 people living and working in the community . Business boomed and the village attracted thousands of visitors. Between 1795-1799, for example, over 3,000 visitors came to see what was happening in New Lanark. Many visitors were themselves businessmen & manufacturers (including one Robert Owen). Some were landed gentry and members of the aristocracy; some were politicians, lawyers, bankers, teachers, medics, academics, scientists and a few (William and Dorothy Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge) were to become famous ‚ÄòRomantics‚Äô. A surprising number came from abroad ‚Äì not just from European countries such as Spain, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Norway, but also from several U.S. states (New York, Kentucky, Virginia, Boston, Georgia, North Carolina). From further afield, some came from Barbados, Jamaica, Antigua, Grenada and Dominica and there were even a few from Africa and India (Sierra Leone, Bengal, Calcutta). What were they coming to see? They were attracted by a very successful spinning business but New Lanark was more famous as a model factory community where business, philanthropy and education all came together for the first time anywhere in Britain. The community became as famous for its social & educational provision as it did for anything else ‚Äì something which Robert Owen was later to capitalise upon. The Apprentice Children Much of the focus was on Dale‚Äôs treatment of his child employees ‚Äì the so-called Apprentice or Pauper children. Unbelievable as it sounds today, it was common practice for large numbers of children to be employed in mills (and elsewhere) from the age of 6 or 7 to age 15 or thereabouts. In New Lanark, village children worked alongside some 300 Apprentice or Pauper children from the charity workhouses in Glasgow and Edinburgh. They were often (but not always) orphans, looked after by the parish, which was very keen to reduce costs by sending them out to work. The children were not paid but were given board & lodging in No.4 Mill. To begin with, they worked as reelers and pickers but later they worked at a range of jobs where they could learn skills which they could use when they left the mills. Some joined the army and navy; some became joiners or smiths and some were kept on in New Lanark. Employers like Dale were seen as charitable and benevolent because they offered the chance of employment, board and lodging and the acquisition of transferable skills. The children worked from 6am until 7pm, with breaks for breakfast and dinner. They were given two sets of work clothes which were laundered regularly and a blue dress uniform for Sundays. Sleeping quarters were regularly cleaned and there is evidence to show that many of the pauper children enjoyed better conditions than some of the local children. Public Health campaigner, Dr James Currie was one of the many visitors. He noted that: > The utmost cleanliness, health and order pervaded the whole manufactory. The > children looked cheerful and happy with rosy cheeks and chubby countenances, > and I found a variety of excellent regulations established for health, > morals and knowledge. Much like Owen later on, Dale was convinced that a good education was essential for all involved. This was a new development in the evolution of factory communities. In England, owners like Arkwright offered Sunday schools but in New Lanark, there was a day school (every day) for under-sixes and an evening school (7-9pm) for older children. There was a formal curriculum which comprised the 3Rs, sewing, church music and religious study. At one stage, the school roll totalled more than 500 pupils and Dale was employing 16 trained teachers to teach more than eight classes. The pupils were grouped according to their ability and promoted to the next class after suitable tests. Teachers received a bonus for each pupil promoted. All available evidence indicates that he provided conditions far superior to anything available in Britain at the time. As such, New Lanark became something of a magnet for visitors and tourists alike. Dale was very clear about the practical value of his efforts and summed up the situation perfectly: > ‚Ä¶when it is considered that the greater part of the children who are in the > boarding house consists of destitute orphans, children abandoned by their > parents... and many who know not who were their parents... it gives me great > pleasure to say, that by proper management and attention, much good instead > of evil may be done at cotton mills. For I am warranted in affirming that > many now have stout, healthy bodies and are of decent behaviour who in all > probability would have been languishing with disease and pests to society > had they not been employed at Lanark cotton mills. Robert Owen visited on a number of occasions and by 1799 had married Dale‚Äôs daughter. Shortly thereafter, he took over the management of the mills and a new chapter began ‚Äì but one which owed a huge debt to Dale‚Äôs creation ‚Äì something which Owen seldom acknowledged. Business While this would all have been quite enough for most people, Dale‚Äôs business interests continued to expand. He had a house in New Lanark but the day to day management was left to William Kelly, a skilled engineer and manager. The main offices of the business were in St Andrew‚Äôs Square, Glasgow and Dale continued to live in Charlotte Street in the city. (Later in life he added a country house, Rosebank, in Cambuslang, to his properties.) He divided his time between New Lanark, the Royal Bank and the offices in St Andrews Square. However, this is only half of the Dale story. He was an entrepreneur of the highest order and, while New Lanark was the biggest of his businesses, it was not the only one. He was involved in a number of other cotton mills. Not long after spinning began in New Lanark, Dale built a new mill in Blantyre and once again, there was a school for the apprentices. He sold the venture to James Monteith in 1792. The mills are better known nowadays as the birthplace of missionary David Livingstone. In 1788, Dale went into partnership with Claud Alexander of Ballochmyle (former Paymaster for the East India Company) in a spinning mill in Catrine in Ayrshire. Dale was heavily involved in the design of these mills and within a few years, some 1,300 people were employed. Once again there were apprentice (but no pauper) children and a proper school was provided. He remained involved with the business until 1801 when the mills were sold to James Finlay. Dale‚Äôs interests spread far and wide. In partnership with a number of others, he opened a small mill in Spinningdale in Sutherland. This was more a charitable effort than anything else. The aim was to provide work and relieve famine, distress in the area and also to stem the tide of emigration from the Highlands. Dale remained involved long after all the others had left and continued to finance it until two years before his death. The mill burned down a year later. In Glasgow, Dale‚Äôs business profile continued to grow. In Dalmarnock he set up a dyeworks where cloth was dyed with a new, colourfast dye called ‚ÄòTurkey Red‚Äô (sometimes known in the city as 'Dale‚Äôs Red‚Äô). In the centre of town, in what is now Ingram Street, he built a warehouse and small manufactory which produced linen strips or tapes known as ‚Äòincles‚Äô or Scotch Tape. The company traded under the name Dale, Campbell, Reid & Dale. The second Dale here is David Dale‚Äôs nephew, also David, and known as David Dale Junior. Still in Glasgow, Dale invested a significant sum in the insurance business. He became a Director of the Glasgow Fire Insurance Company. Despite its name, the company sold life insurance and annuities and had offices in George Street and Wilson Street. Dale also owned a significant amount of land and property in and around the city. Records show at least 18 land and property transactions in his name. These included lands and tenements in the Ramshorn (Ingram Street) area, tenements in Shuttle Street, properties in Barrowfield and Ruchill and a major investment in land and property in the Parkhead area. Philanthropy and Civic Duty So far, this account of Dale‚Äôs life has shown him to be a very successful businessman but he was equally famous for his involvement with charitable projects throughout the city ‚Äì not merely as a subscriber but as a Director or Manager. Without exception, newspaper reports of the time talk of his charity, his kindness, his benevolence and his good deeds and public works. Undoubtedly, much of this was inspired by his religious belief. He was a strongly evangelical Christian, a pastor in the Dissenting (Secessionist) Church, often to be found preaching on Sundays in meeting houses all over the city. He made his position clear in one of his sermons: > Riches are one great object. These frequently take to themselves wings and > flyaway... they profit not in the day of wrath. And if these are obtained by > oppressing the poor, or withholding from the needy what his wants demand > from us, the consequence is awful... your riches are corrupted. It seems his reputation for benevolence and charity was well deserved. He donated lots of money to small charitable ventures on a regular basis. These included the Howard Fund for prison reform, an injured servicemen‚Äôs charity, the Royal Northern Infirmary in Inverness, Perth Academy and the newly-formed Glasgow Humane Society, where he agreed to become a Director and undertake fundraising on their behalf. He was better known for some of his more public philanthropy and civic duties. He served as a Bailie and Magistrate in the city for two years ‚Äì something which he found particularly time-consuming and onerous. Nevertheless, he earned a reputation in the press for his relatively lenient approach and became known as ‚ÄòThe Benevolent Magistrate‚Äô. When it became clear that a new road was required between Clydesdale and England, he gave ¬£700 towards the cost ‚Äì a great deal of money. Spinningdale has already been mentioned but on several occasions he helped to feed those in need. For example, he provided meal to the poor in Stewarton at below cost price and he sent a ship to the U.S. to bring back grain which he distributed to the poor in Glasgow.left His desire to help those in need continued in his commitment to two very public institutions in Glasgow. He served for twenty years as a Director of the Town‚Äôs Hospital‚Äì the equivalent of a charity workhouse for the poor, orphans, elderly, sick and, until 1814, the mentally ill. Dale served on the institution‚Äôs Manufacturing Committee and took his duties very seriously. 295x295px The same can be said for his involvement with Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The Infirmary was intended ‚Äò...for the reception of indigent persons under bodily distress in the west of Scotland‚Äô. Dale was involved in this project from its very beginning in 1788. He chaired the group which raised the funds, found the land and supervised the building work of this major city institution. He subscribed ¬£200 of his own money and when the building finally opened in 1795, he was appointed as a manager, along with several of the city‚Äôs most prominent men. Once again, he was very committed to this cause and spent the rest of his life as a Manager or Director. He stood to gain nothing personally from this commitment. The Infirmary was for the poor. However, as a Manager and annual subscriber, he had the right to refer a number of his workers from New Lanark and between 1795 and 1803 he personally referred some 64 patients. So far, so good. Dale was a successful businessman and a generous philanthropist. There is one issue in all of this which needs to be considered ‚Äì and not just in the case of David Dale. The wealth of Glasgow‚Äôs merchants (and therefore of the city itself), whether it derived from tobacco, cotton, rum or sugar, depended on the labour of enslaved men, women and children. Until relatively recently, this was never discussed in much detail. Many of Glasgow‚Äôs powerful group of West India merchants, for example, had direct connections to plantations of one form or another and took little part in the burgeoning anti-slavery movement of the late 18th century. Indeed, some of them traded slaves for profit. What was Dale‚Äôs position on all of this?  Dale, slavery and the abolition Movement  The raw cotton which Dale, in common with all British mill owners, used for spinning in his mills came from three principal sources, i.e. the United States (e.g. Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana), South America (Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and the West Indies (Trinidad, Bahamas, Jamaica etc.) ‚Äì all places where slave labour was the norm. Cotton was traded in the U.K‚Äôs major cities, including Glasgow. Anyone who worked in the cotton industry, therefore, depended on the slave trade either directly or indirectly. However, by the late 18th century, attitudes to slavery were beginning to change. The Abolition movement was growing and the slavery issue could not be ignored any longer. Nationally, the Abolitionists were led by Thomas Clarkson and William Wilberforce in London and the London Society sent representatives across the country seeking support for anti-slavery petitions. Glasgow‚Äôs response was to set up The Glasgow Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in January 1791. David Dale was in the Chair. (It is also worth noting that, in the same year, Dale bought shares in the newly-formed Sierra Leone Company which sought to establish a colony of freed slaves.)For a full discussion of Dale, slavery and Abolition, see McLaren, D.J. (2015) David Dale: A Life. Ch.12. Stenlake Publishing Ltd. Chairing the Glasgow Society was a huge statement on Dale‚Äôs part ‚Äì and a courageous one. He stood to lose power and influence among the city‚Äôs West India merchants and possibly other members of the Chamber of Commerce, but he did support the (albeit gradual) abolition of the slave trade. The Glasgow group‚Äôs first task was to publicise the London Society‚Äôs pamphlet, with a Preface about the new Glasgow Society. There were various meetings throughout 1791, all chaired by Dale and the Glasgow Society sent 100 guineas to the London campaign offices. The following year, the Glasgow Society met on a number of occasions in support of the various public petitions which were being drawn up in all the cities and towns in Scotland. At a General Meeting of the Glasgow Society on 1 February 1792, with Dale in the Chair, the members resolved; > ‚Ä¶that the traffic in the human species is founded on the grossest injustice, > is attended with the utmost cruelty and barbarity to an innocent race of men > and is productive of ruin and desolation of a country which the efforts of > the well-directed industry of Great Britain might contribute to civilise.The > Caledonian Mercury, 9 February 1792 On Commerce and the Enlightenment: > [the slave trade]‚Ä¶is directly repugnant to the primary laws of nature‚Ä¶and > that its continuance, in this enlightened age, is disgraceful to the nation > and utterly inconsistant (sic) with the profession of Christians.The > Caledonian Mercury, 9 February 1792 It is surely to Dale‚Äôs credit that he took a public stand against slavery when so many in the city refused to do so. It was risky in that he did not want to alienate the people with whom he required to do business and he required to do business to keep hundreds of people in employment and to support many more people through his charitable work. Moral positions in the late 18th century were not always clear cut. Robert Burns, often see as the champion of equality, was just days away from leaving these shores to work as a bookkeeper (often a synonym for ‚Äòoverseer‚Äô) in a Jamaican plantation. In the U.S., Washington and Jefferson, the advocates of freedom and liberty for all, were both slave owners. Closer to home, David Hume, Scotland‚Äôs famous philosopher of the liberal Enlightenment, took a rather less liberal view of things when he wrote that ‚Äòthere never was a polished society but of the white race, to which all others are naturally inferior‚Äô and that ‚Äò‚Ä¶there never was a civilised nation of any other complexion than white‚Äô. Dale, like all the other mill owners, used slave cotton but, unlike all the others, did what he could to begin the process of abolishing the slave trade. Had more of his colleagues joined him, abolition might not have taken such a long time.  The End of the Beginning  The grave of David Dale, Ramshorn Cemetery When Dale died at home, 43 Charlotte StreetGlasgow Post Office Directory 1805 in central Glasgow in March 1806, huge crowds of mourners lined the streets of Glasgow. He was laid to rest in the Ramshorn Cemetery in central Glasgow in a plot he had purchased some years before. The grave lies on the outer east wall towards the north-east corner. It is marked by an extremely simple stone which (like most others in the Ramshorn) makes no mention of his works or even date of birth and death. Obituaries appeared in all the newspapers, including the London Times. The Glasgow Herald‚Äôs assessment of him was typical of the time. As well as acknowledging his achievements as a businessman, the paper noted that: > ‚Ä¶his ear was never shut to the cry of distress; his private charities were > boundless; and every public institution which had for its object the > alleviation or prevention of human misery, in this world or in the world to > come, received from him the most liberal support and encouragement. But the story does not quite end there. Dale‚Äôs death saw the beginning of a new era in New Lanark under Owen. The great social experiment, the New Moral World, the New Social System ‚Äì all Owen‚Äôs ideas ‚Äì were tested in New Lanark. Pestalozzian education, nursery schooling, communitarian living ‚Äì all were tried in New Lanark and the community‚Äôs fame grew even more. Owen, however, was always keen to emphasise his own achievements and deliberately underplayed and undervalued Dale‚Äôs achievements. There were also serious questions (still unanswered) about Owen‚Äôs role in the administration of the Dale estate. Dale‚Äôs daughters, for example, never received the money they should have from their father‚Äôs estate. That Owen became famous is not in doubt ‚Äì and rightly so. What is equally clear is that, having been overshadowed by Owen for so long, Dale also deserves some recognition. The Royal Bank, the New Lanark Trust and the Friends of New Lanark are among the few organisations who have sought to rekindle interest in Dale over the years and there is a growing recognition in the academic world but there is some way to go before the general public become aware of his important role in Scottish history and it is to be hoped that Dale‚Äôs achievements in the 18th century are recognised as much as Owen‚Äôs in the 19th century.

It is a form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/pulmonary- disorders/interstitial-lung-diseases/cryptogenic-organizing-pneumonia It is often a complication of an existing chronic inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, or it can be a side effect of certain medications such as amiodarone. COP was first described by Gary Epler in 1985. The clinical features and radiological imaging resemble infectious pneumonia. However, diagnosis is suspected after there is no response to multiple antibiotics, and blood and sputum cultures are negative for organisms. Terminology \\"Organizing\\" refers to unresolved pneumonia (in which the alveolar exudate persists and eventually undergoes fibrosis) in which fibrous tissue forms in the alveoli. The phase of resolution and/or remodeling following bacterial infections is commonly referred to as organizing pneumonia, both clinically and pathologically. The American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society hold that \\"cryptogenic organizing pneumonia\\" is the preferred clinical term for this disease for multiple reasons:[https://books.google.se/books?id=j-eYLc1BA3oC&pg;=PA64 Page 64 in: *Avoid confusion with bronchiolitis obliterans, which may not be visualized in every case of this disease. *Avoid confusion with constrictive bronchiolitis *Emphasize the cryptogenic nature of the disease Signs and symptoms The classic presentation of COP is the development of nonspecific systemic (e.g., fevers, chills, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss) and respiratory (e.g. difficulty breathing, cough) symptoms in association with filling of the lung alveoli that is visible on chest x-ray. This presentation is usually so suggestive of an infection that the majority of patients with COP have been treated with at least one failed course of antibiotics by the time the true diagnosis is made. Causes * Pulmonary infection by bacteria, viruses and parasites * Drugs: antineoplastic drugs, erlotinib, amiodarone * Chemical exposure, most notably to diacetyl ** Vaping: On October 17, 2019, the American Journal of Clinical Pathology reported that lung biopsies from patients with vaping-associated pulmonary illness show acute lung injury patterns, including organizing pneumonia. * Ionizing radiations * Inflammatory diseases ** Systemic lupus ** Rheumatoid arthritis (RA-associated COP) ** Scleroderma * Bronchial obstruction ** Proximal bronchial squamous cell carcinoma It was identified in 1985, although its symptoms had been noted before but not recognised as a separate lung disease. The risk of COP is higher for people with inflammatory diseases like lupus, dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. Diagnosis On clinical examination, crackles are common, and more rarely, patients may have clubbing (<5% of cases). Laboratory findings are nonspecific. Almost 75% of people have symptoms for less than two months before seeking medical attention. A flu-like illness, with a cough, fever, a feeling of illness (malaise), fatigue, and weight loss heralds the onset in about 40% of patients. Doctors do not find any specific abnormalities on routine laboratory tests or on a physical examination, except for the frequent presence of crackling sounds (called rales) upon auscultation with a stethoscope by the care provider. Pulmonary function tests usually show that the amount of air the lungs can hold is below normal. The amount of oxygen in the blood is often low at rest and is even lower with exercise. =Imaging= CT scan showing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (biopsy-proven) The reversed halo sign is seen in about 20% of individuals with COP. The chest x-ray is distinctive with features that appear similar to an extensive pneumonia, with both lungs showing widespread white patches. The white patches may seem to migrate from one area of the lung to another as the disease persists or progresses. Computed tomography (CT) may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Often the findings are typical enough to allow the doctor to make a diagnosis without ordering additional tests. To confirm the diagnosis, a doctor may perform a lung biopsy using a bronchoscope. Many times, a larger specimen is needed and must be removed surgically. Plain chest radiography shows normal lung volumes, with characteristic patchy unilateral or bilateral consolidation. Small nodular opacities occur in up to 50% of patients and large nodules in 15%. On high resolution computed tomography, airspace consolidation with air bronchograms is present in more than 90% of patients, often with a lower zone predominance. A subpleural or peribronchiolar distribution is noted in up to 50% of patients. Ground glass appearance or hazy opacities associated with the consolidation are detected in most patients. Pulmonary physiology is restrictive with a reduced diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Airflow limitation is uncommon; gas exchange is usually abnormal and mild hypoxemia is common. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage reveals up to 40% lymphocytes, along with more subtle increases in neutrophils and eosinophils. In patients with typical clinical and radiographic features, a transbronchial biopsy that shows the pathologic pattern of organizing pneumonia and lacks features of an alternative diagnosis is adequate to make a tentative diagnosis and start therapy. On surgical lung biopsy, the histopathologic pattern is organizing pneumonia with preserved lung architecture; this pattern is not exclusive to COP and must be interpreted in the clinical context. Histologically, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is characterized by the presence of polypoid plugs of loose organizing connective tissue (Masson bodies) within alveolar ducts, alveoli, and bronchioles. Unusual presentations of organizing pneumonia While patchy bilateral disease is typical, there are unusual variants of organizing pneumonia where it may appear as multiple nodules or masses. One rare presentation, focal organizing pneumonia, may be indistinguishable from lung cancer based on imaging alone, requiring biopsy or surgical resection to make the diagnosis. Complications Rare cases of COP have induced with lobar cicatricial atelectasis. Treatment Most patients recover with corticosteroid therapy. A standardized approach to dosing starting at 0.75 mg/kg and weaning over 24 weeks has been shown to reduce total corticosteroid exposure without affecting outcome. About two thirds of patients recover with corticosteroid therapy: the usual corticosteroid administered is prednisolone in Europe and prednisone in the US; these differ by only one functional group and have the same clinical effect. The corticosteroid is initially administered in high dosage, typically 50 mg per day tapering down to zero over a six-month to one-year period. If the corticosteroid treatment is halted too quickly the disease may return.

It runs into the village of Grendon, which forms a parish itself. History There were mining activities in the area for centuries before the two main shafts, which formed Baddesley Colliery, were sunk in 1850. Although called Baddesley Colliery it was actually just over the border in Baxterley. From then on until 1989 when the pit closed most Baddesley men worked in some capacity at the mine. The worst disaster at the mine occurred on 2 May 1882. There was a fire followed by an explosion and 23 men lost their lives in attempting to rescue nine night shift workers trapped by the fire. A memorial to all the men who worked in the mines, in the form of a pit head winding wheel was erected on the common on the site of the old Maypole pit. Since the closure of the mine the village is now mainly residential. Landmarks Baddesley Ensor is known for its common. There are beautiful views to be seen looking over towards Birmingham, and also Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire. Other landmarks are the old wheel used for mining, the old pit, and a bomb hole. The pit has since been developed into a distribution center for Jaguar Land-Rover, with a capacity to contain up to 9,500 cars for distribution to dealers. Transport The A5 (Watling Street) runs near to the village and the M42 is nearby. The village is served by bus routes 748, 761, 766, 767, and the nearest railway station is Atherstone. The nearest airports are Birmingham (10 miles) and East Midlands (20 miles). Media Local newspapers are the Tamworth Herald, which has a separate edition for North Warwickshire, and the Atherstone & Coleshill Herald. The BBC radio station covering the area is BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. Local commercial stations in the area include Free Coventry & Warwickshire and Capital Mid- Counties. The village is covered by the Central ITV and BBC West Midlands TV regions broadcast from the nearby Sutton Coldfield transmitting station.

It can be done for strictly monetary reasons, but typically there is some amount of personal access involved. One of the main motivators for a fractional purchase is the ability to share the costs of maintaining an asset that will not be used full- time by one owner. Every fractional endeavour requires some sort of management, to administer the rules and regulations (which are agreed upon before the fraction is purchased) and maintain the asset to the degree laid out in the ownership documents. Generally, management will oversee the daily operation of more than one property, although it is not necessary. A single fractional asset may be managed by a single entity. Each owner is guaranteed a prescribed amount of access to the asset, which typically can be used or offered to the public as rental or charter, the income is usually split between the management company and the fractional owner, unless the owner finds the renter himself. Additionally, each owner pays a portion of the annual management fees and maintenance, relative to the percent of ownership. In business, fractional ownership is a percentage share of an expensive asset. Shares are sold to individual owners. Typically, a company manages the asset on behalf of the owners, who pay monthly/annual fees for the management plus variable (e.g., per-hour, per-day) use fees. For rapidly depreciating assets, the management company may sell the asset and distribute the proceeds back to the owners, who can then claim a capital loss and optionally purchase a fraction of a new asset. Whether fractional ownership provides a financial advantage over renting is an ongoing debate, and some countries and regions have tax laws that provide additional benefits for owners, such as capital- loss allowances, while others might penalize ownership over renting. Aviation Fractional ownership offers an individual or company the option to purchase a share of an aircraft. Shares from as little as 1/16 of an aircraft, which offers approximately 50 hours of flight time per year, to 1/2 of an aircraft can be purchased, depending on the needs of the operator. The most common amounts purchased usually range from about 1/8 to 1/4 (approximately 200 flight hours per year) of an aircraft. Though the owner takes title of the portion of their investment, they are not assigned to a dedicated aircraft for usage. Instead, they are given access to a pool of similar aircraft, and therefore, theoretically, an owner may never actually fly on their titled jet. Co-owners (referred to as 'owners') of a fractional program's aircraft are required to pay a percentage of the aircraft's purchase price that is proportionate to the number of hours they wish to fly per year, for the duration of their contract‚Äîtypically 5 years. In addition to the price, there are fees charged for all occupied flight hours (that fluctuate with changes in fuel prices), as well as monthly fixed-management fees that cover maintenance and administration of the program. In return, the customer receives a predetermined number of hours in the aircraft of their choice, based on the owner's needs and the amount they are willing to pay. Fractional owners are guaranteed that this aircraft, or another aircraft of the same model or comparable aircraft type, will be available 24 hours a day, 365 days per year, with as little as four hours' notice. In addition, the management company provides all scheduling, flight planning, staffing, catering, maintenance, communications, and insurance services. A fractional owner simply picks up the phone, calls a dispatcher, requests a flight, and drives to the airport. =History= The term fractional ownership originally became popular for business jets. Richard Santulli of NetJets pioneered the concept of allowing businesses to purchase shares in a jet to reduce costs. With a fractional jet plan, members will typically fly in any jet available, not necessarily the one in which they own shares. The management company will reposition jets as necessary and provide flight crews. Companies with greater needs purchase larger shares to get access to more time. The fractional ownership concept has since been extended to smaller aircraft and now has become common for single-engine piston aircraft like the Cirrus SR22, which are beyond the financial means of many private pilots. The same concepts apply, except that the management company may not provide flight crews nor reposition the aircraft. Many pilots get together to buy light aircraft in a privately bought and managed fractional ownership, this is often known as group flying. Fractional ownership has played a significant role in revitalizing the general aviation manufacturing industry since the late 1990s, and most manufacturers actively support fractional ownership programs. Fractional property ownership Fractional ownership simply means the division of any asset into portions or shares. If the \\"asset\\" is a property, the title or deed can be legally divided into shares. In certain instances this is done by creating a \\"mezzanine structure\\", i.e., creating a company which owns the property then allowing multiple owners or investors to own shares in the company. Those shares can then be purchased and owned by more than one individual. The reasons for a \\"mezzanine structure\\" can vary. Two common reasons are to allow transfer of shares without the need to reflect changes on the title or deed to the property, and for tax benefits. Another type of fractional ownership, not part of a securitized business plan is Tenancy in Common, which is grounded in the real property laws of most, if not all states. The main difference is there is no right of survivorship to the sponsor or other owners if one or more of owners were to pass away. Where there are similarities with the equal sharing of operational expenses, rental income and access, the striking difference is free transferability of the owner's interest in the property without regard to the other owners in the property. Shared ownership of the property and its deed will also entitle shareholders to certain usage rights, usually in the form of weeks. Conceptually, fractional ownership is not the same as timeshare. Fractional ownership affords much of the freedom and usage benefits offered in timeshare; however, the fundamental difference with fractional ownership is that the purchaser owns part of the title (as opposed to units of \\"time\\"). Therefore, if the property appreciates in value, then so do the shares. As with whole ownership, fractional owners can sell whenever they deem necessary or prudent, releasing the capital growth from their \\"bricks & mortar\\" investment. Real property  The practice of joining together with family and friends to share ownership of vacation property has been around for many years. But the fractional property industry started in the U.S. in the Rocky Mountains ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first fractional developments recognized that people did not want to buy whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates, there were over 312 fractional developments in North America in 2017. The U.S. Mountain region has the majority of active fractional property available, with the U.S. Pacific region next. The prevalent leisure activity for owners of fractional property in the U.S. Mountain region is skiing. In 2018, the most common fractional size available for purchase in North America is a one-fourth ownership, giving owners three months of total annual visit usage. Outside the USA a non-commercial form of fractional ownership has been in existence for several decades. In this form, otherwise unconnected individuals (rather than family or friends) form private syndicates to purchase, for example, vacation property or boats. These syndicates operate as private member groups with small numbers on a non-profit basis, generally just sharing expenses and usage. These groups can involve assets ranging from modest apartments or condominium-type properties to multimillion-euro / dollar properties, and leverage their ability to make collective purchases of additional assets such as boats or vehicles as additional facilities while retaining control entirely within the membership of the group. The popularity of the term fractional ownership has caused extensive rebranding in other industries where similar concepts, such as real estate timeshares, were already well established. The main distinction between timeshare and fractional ownership is that with a timeshare you buy the right to use a property, but with fractional ownership, you are buying real estate. You get a deeded piece of real estate, just not for the entire parcel. Fractional ownership divides a property into more affordable segments for individuals and also matches an individual's ownership time to their actual usage time. A fractional share gives the owners certain privileges, such as a number of days or weeks when they can use the property. Occasionally, the property is sold after a predetermined time, distributing the relative proceeds back to the owners. A few private owner-groups have developed highly sophisticated usage allocation schemes and other features based on the principle of attempting to get as close as possible to the flexibility of individual ownership, and only compromising this to the minimum extent necessary to accommodate multiple owners. In such schemes, the basic agreement is between the members themselves, whereas in most commercial fractional ownership schemes, the owner's principal relationship is with the property developer and/or promoter of the scheme. = Private residence clubs = Private residence clubs are the luxury, high end of the fractional property market. The research firm Ragatz Associates defines a private residence club as a fractional property that sells at a price of US$1,000 per square foot or higher. Private residence clubs provide the services and amenities of five-star hotels, and some of the luxury hotel groups run their own clubs. Occasionally, membership in a private residence club grants to its member only the right to usage of the club properties and services, without ownership rights in the properties themselves. Note that a private residence club is different from a destination club, although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. In addition to luxury private residence clubs, single \\"stand-alone\\" vacation homes and condos can be converted to fractional ownership. This fractional home conversion process can be accomplished by any knowledgeable seller or through a fractional consulting company. The benefit of fractional home conversion includes the ability of the homeowner to keep a portion of the ownership for themselves, pay off debt and reduce expenses. A key aspect for any fractional owner is to understand their usage rights and the reservation plans. These vary from property to property. Some offer fixed occupancy periods in which an owner uses the same time each year. Some offer \\"floating\\" periods, in which the occupancy times rotate throughout the year, and some offer a mixture of these, with some time fixed and some floating. Another variation in the business model is what are called \\"destination resorts\\". These are typically properties, whether hotel rooms, suites, or freestanding villas, located on property owned and managed by a hotel developer, and which provide amenities typically expected of a high-class hotel or resort. Some hotels are also developed as a condo hotel, in which individual rooms are sold off to individual owners. Other areas Fractional ownership is also beginning to appear for luxury items such as small yachts and megayachts, jet aircraft (especially business jets) and high-end motor homes. Fractional yacht / boat ownership provides marine enthusiasts with ownership of shares in yachts of all sizes and uses. Some programs sell actual equity in the watercraft and others sell \\"membership,\\" where the members' dues provide access to the boats, but no ownership. Fractional yacht companies sell shares/membership in small motor boats, sailboats, mid-range yachts all the way to the megayachts for day-use, multi-year contracts, or charter-like arrangements.

Levi is one of two locations of gondola lifts in Finland, and has been chosen the best domestic skiing resort in Finland four times. Levi is an early stop on the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup circuit, hosting slaloms in mid-November; the races in 2019 were held slightly later (November 23‚Äì24). With snowmaking, the climate provides a reliable early season technical venue in Europe, prior to the late autumn events in North America. The slopes in Levi are mostly suitable for beginners or intermediates, but there are also three black slopes for experts. The highest vertical drop is and the longest slope is in length. The longest ski lift is about long. Levi has one superpipe, one halfpipe, two streets, two snow parks, 10 free children's slopes and seven slope restaurants. The skiing and snowboarding season in Levi is fairly long, often lasting from October to mid-May. The ski school provides instruction in downhill skiing, snowboarding, telemark skiing and cross-country skiing. Cross-country skiers have illuminated ski tracks and snow that lingers well into the spring. There are of cross-country skiing tracks and of snowmobiling tracks in Levi. The resort's latitude, north of the Arctic Circle, usually guarantees generous snow cover and sub-freezing temperatures (< ) throughout winter. It also allows for excellent chances of observing the Northern Lights. Although very popular in winter, Levi is very quiet in the summertime, yet still a good base location for exploring the surrounding areas. At from the centre of Levi is Luvattumaa, Levi Ice Hotel & Ice Gallery; from Levi is the Snow Village Lainio, where one can view snow and ice buildings, eat in an ice restaurant (in Lainio), or experience a night's sleep in an ice room.

The rank associated with the position is lieutenant general (3-star). Lieutenant General Richard Burr, the incumbent Chief of Army, has held the post since 2 July 2018. History The first Commander of the Australian Army was titled General Officer Commanding, Australian Military Forces, in line with the usual British practice of the time. Experience soon showed that the position concentrated more power than the Ministers for Defence‚Äîof whom there were twelve in as many years in 1901‚Äì1913‚Äîliked. Moreover, the British Army had encountered administrative problems in the Second Boer War which led to the abolition of the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Forces there in 1904, and its replacement by an Army Board. In 1904, Minister for Defence Anderson Dawson commissioned a report which recommended a similar system for Australia, with a Military Board consisting of four military members, the minister, and a finance member. This was implemented by his successor, James Whiteside McCay. However instead of creating a Chief of the General Staff as per the report, McCay's Military Board consisted of only three military members, the Deputy Adjutant General, the Chief of Ordnance, and the Chief of Intelligence. The post of Chief of the General Staff was finally created by the new Minister of Defence, George Pearce, in 1909, with Colonel William Bridges becoming the first Chief of the General Staff. The military members of the Military Board then became the Chief of the General Staff, Adjutant General, Chief of Ordnance, and Quartermaster General. During the Second World War, the threat of invasion led to a reversion to the old system. A Commander in Chief, General Sir Thomas Blamey, was appointed, and the Military Board was suspended, with its powers being transferred to the Commander in Chief. The post of Chief of the General Staff remained, but was now subordinate to the Commander in Chief. This was successful from a military point of view but the problem of a concentration of power recurred and, after the war ended, the government decided to re-form the Military Board. Blamey was replaced by Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee in 1945 and the next year the post of Commander in Chief was again abolished, with Sturdee becoming Chief of the General Staff. The system continued until the reforms of Arthur Tange in 1973. The three services were unified under the Department of Defence. The Military Board was abolished and the Chief of the General Staff became subordinate to the Chief of the Defence Force Staff and the Secretary of Defence. Reflecting this change from a staff to a command role, the post was renamed Chief of Army in 1997.

Biography His father worked for the Royal Accounting Office. He was the younger brother of Francesco Gamba, who was already well-established as a painter when Enrico was a boy. At the age of twelve, he was enrolled at the Accademia Albertina, where he studied with Michele Cusa, Giovanni Marghinotti and Carlo Arienti.Brief biography from the Dizionario Biografico @ Treccani. Repose In 1850, he went to Germany, where he studied at the St√§delschule in Frankfurt with Eduard von Steinle. After graduating, he toured Northern Europe with his friend, the English painter Frederic Leighton, then returned to Italy, where they frequented the Antico Caff√® Greco and came to be influenced by Friedrich Overbeck. His first major exhibitions were in 1854, at the \\"Promotrice di Torino\\", and 1855 at the \\"Esposizione di Brera\\", where he presented one of his best-known works, Titian's Funeral, which was bought by the Royal Family. That same year, he visited Leighton's studio in Paris and obtained a teaching position at the Albertina. Three of his best-known students there were , Giovanni Battista Quadrone and Canuto Borelli. In 1860, the Ministry of Public Instruction commissioned him to paint a scene of King Victor Amadeus II giving aid to the victims of the War of the Spanish Succession. The painting, completed in 1864, was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1867. Carlo Goldoni Seeking Inspiration Following Italian unification, he devoted himself primarily to institutional work involving patriotic scenes from the Risorgimento period. In 1872, he created another well-known work, showing the playwright Carlo Goldoni studying the common people for inspiration. It was presented at a major exposition in Venice. He collaborated with Andrea Gastaldi in restoring the Cathedral of Chieri and, from 1882 to 1883, painted some Stations of the Cross for the in Turin.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,373.  Location  Witherley is situated in the far west of Leicestershire. The Warwickshire-Leicestershire border runs parallel to the parish boundary, along the River Anker to the west and the A5 to the south. The village centre is less than 2 miles from the town of Atherstone and 1 mile from the village of Mancetter.  Village features  One of its significant features is the church of St Peter, noted for its tall steeple, \\"\\"/ 157.4 ft. The village school, Witherley Church of England Primary School, is located next to the church. Usually, children attending the school will transfer to Market Bosworth School at the appropriate age. Other notable attributes are the River Anker that runs alongside the border of Witherley, The Old House B&B; and the Blue Lion public house located in the center of the village.  History  Proximity to the county border meant that parliamentary troops from the Warwickshire garrisons made several visits to Witherley and Atterton during the Civil War. A list of claims for losses and \\"free quarter\\" to the Warwickshire county committee in June, 1646 includes a claim for free quarter for a hundred men and horse under the command of Captain Levell and Captain Astewe from Colonel Purefoy's regiment of the Coventry garrison, estimated to be worth ¬£9.

Richardson was the first to receive a land grant in the city, deeded to him by the alcalde, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Estudillo. He was subsequently granted the Rancho Saucelito, an even larger rancho land holding across San Francisco Bay comprising a large portion of present-day southeastern Marin County. On these lands, he founded the city of Sausalito. Life Richardson arrived as second mate aboard the British whaling ship Orion in San Francisco Bay in 1822, shortly after Mexico had won its independence from Spain. An English mariner who had picked up a fluency in Spanish during his travels, he jumped ship after meeting and dancing with a local woman, Maria Antonia Martinez, at an all-night fiesta. He quickly became an influential presence in the now-Mexican territory. By 1825, Richardson had assumed Mexican citizenship, converted to Roman Catholicism and married Maria Antonia Martinez (1803‚Äì1887), the eldest daughter of Ygnacio Martinez, commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco and, in 1842, grantee of Rancho El Pinole. His ambitions now expanding to land holdings of his own; Richardson submitted a petition to Governor Echeand√≠a for a rancho on the headlands across the Golden Gate from the Presidio, to be called \\"Rancho Saucelito\\".Robert Ryal Miller, Captain Richardson, Mariner, Ranchero, and Founder of San Francisco Berkeley: La Loma Press, 1995 [Call number at SSU: Regional Room F869 .S353 R546] 1995 The Spanish word Saucelito is believed to refer to a small cluster of willows, a moist-soil tree, indicating the presence of a freshwater spring and/or creekTracy, Jack.

(possibly Coyote Creek). \\"Birthplace of a great city\\" plaque at 823 Grant Avenue, San Francisco, commemorating Richardson's erection of Yerba Buena's first housing structure in 1835 Even before filing his claim, Richardson had used the fresh-water source to establish a watering station on the shores of what is now the town of Sausalito (with changed spelling), selling fresh water to visiting vessels. Between Sausalito and the Tiburon Peninsula to the north is an inlet of San Francisco Bay, now called Richardson Bay, which formed part of the northern limit to Richardson's claim. However, his ownership of the land was legally tenuous: other claims had been submitted for the same region, and, at any rate, Mexican law reserved headlands for military uses, not private ownership. Richardson temporarily abandoned his claim and settled instead outside the Presidio, building the first two-story wood-frame house in the area and laying out the street plan for the pueblo of Yerba Buena (the old plaza is now Portsmouth Square). The small settlement was intended as a trading post and resupply point for ships visiting San Francisco Bay. Richardson's seafaring experience was instrumental in his also being appointed Port Captain, responsible for overseeing maritime commerce and often personally piloting arriving ships to their anchorage. After years of lobbying and legal wrangling, Richardson was given clear title to all of Rancho Saucelito on February 11, 1838. By 1841, he had sold his holdings across the bay and taken possession of the rancho, while still serving as port captain of Yerba Buena. He had financial problems in his later years and died in bankruptcy. In the 1966 episode \\"Water Bringer\\" of the syndicated western television series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Ronald W. Reagan, Rory Calhoun played Richardson in his first visit off the Orion to California. Calhoun's then wife, Lita Baron, was cast as Maria Martinez, the future Mrs. Richardson. Will Kuluva played the part of Ygnacio Martinez. Don Haggerty played the cruel Captain Hayworth, commander of the Orion.

The receiver waits until its network layer passes in the next data packet. The delayed acknowledgement is then attached to this outgoing data frame. This technique of temporarily delaying the acknowledgement so that it can be hooked with next outgoing data frame is known as piggybacking. Working Principle Piggybacking data is a bit different from Sliding Protocol used in the OSI model. In the data frame itself, we incorporate one additional field for acknowledgment (called ACK). Whenever party A wants to send data to party B, it will carry additional ACK information in the PUSH as well. For example, if A has received 5 bytes from B, which sequence number starts from 12340 (through 12344), A will place \\"ACK 12345\\" as well in the current PUSH packet to inform B it has received the bytes up to sequence number 12344 and expects to see 12345 next time. (ACK number is the next sequence number of the data to be PUSHed by the other party.) Three rules govern the piggybacking data transfer. * If station A wants to send both data and an acknowledgment, it keeps both fields there. * If station A wants to send the acknowledgment, after a short period of time to see whether a data frame needs to be sent, then decide whether send an ACK frame alone or attach a data frame with it. * If station A wants to send just the data, then the previous acknowledgment field is sent along with the data. Station B simply ignores this duplicate ACK frame upon receiving.

Computer Networks, 5th Edition, Pearson Education Limited, , 2014, p 226. Disadvantages : The receiver can jam the service if it has nothing to send. This can be solved by enabling a counter (Receiver timeout) when a data frame is received. If the count ends and there is no data frame to send, the receiver will send an ACK control frame. The sender also adds a counter (Emitter timeout), if the counter ends without receiving confirmation, the sender assumes packet loss, and sends the frame again.

Thin paper discs containing an alt= Antibiotic sensitivity testing or antibiotic susceptibility testing is the measurement of the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. It is used because bacteria may have resistance to some antibiotics. Sensitivity testing results can allow a clinician to change the choice of antibiotics from empiric therapy, which is when an antibiotic is selected based on clinical suspicion about the site of an infection and common causative bacteria, to directed therapy, in which the choice of antibiotic is based on knowledge of the organism and its sensitivities. Sensitivity testing usually occurs in a medical laboratory, and may be based on culture methods that expose bacteria to antibiotics, or genetic methods that test to see if bacteria have genes that confer resistance. Culture methods often involve measuring the diameter of areas without bacterial growth, called zones of inhibition, around paper discs containing antibiotics on agar culture dishes that have been evenly inoculated with bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration, which is the lowest concentration of the antibiotic that stops the growth of bacteria, can be estimated from the size of the zone of inhibition. Antibiotic susceptibility testing has occurred since the discovery of the beta-lactam antibiotic penicillin. Initial methods were phenotypic, and involved culture or dilution. The Etest, an antibiotic impregnated strip, has been available since the 1980s, and genetic methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing have been available since the early 2000s. Research is ongoing into improving current methods by making them faster or more accurate, as well as developing new methods for testing, such as microfluidics.  Uses  In clinical medicine, antibiotics are most frequently prescribed on the basis of a person's symptoms and medical guidelines. This method of antibiotic selection is called empiric therapy, and it is based on knowledge about what bacteria cause an infection, and what antibiotics bacteria may be sensitive or resistant to in a geographical area. For example, a simple urinary tract infection might be treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This is because Escherichia coli is the most likely causative bacterium, and may be sensitive to that combination antibiotic. However, bacteria can be resistant to several classes of antibiotics. This resistance might be because a type of bacteria has intrinsic resistance to some antibiotics, because of resistance following past exposure to antibiotics, or because resistance may be transmitted from other sources such as plasmids. Antibiotic sensitivity testing provides information about which antibiotics are more likely to be successful and should therefore be used to treat the infection. Antibiotic sensitivity testing is also conducted at a population level in some countries as a form of screening. This is to assess the background rates of resistance to antibiotics (for example with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and may influence guidelines and public health measures. Methods Example of an Etest, which uses a plastic strip impregnated with an antibiotic at a range of concentrations Testing for antibiotic sensitivity usually occurs in a laboratory. Once a bacterium has been identified following microbiological culture, antibiotics are selected for susceptibility testing. Susceptibility testing methods are based on exposing bacteria to antibiotics and observing the response (phenotypic testing), or specific genetic tests (genetic testing). Methods used may be qualitative, meaning a result indicates resistance is or is not present; or quantitative, using a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to describe the concentration of antibiotic to which a bacterium is sensitive. There are nearly a dozen factors that can affect the results of antibiotic sensitivity testing, including failure of the instrument, temperature, moisture, and potency of the antimicrobial agent. Quality control (QC) testing helps to ensure the accuracy of test results; QC guidelines are available from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). =Phenotypic methods= Testing based on exposing bacteria to antibiotics uses agar plates or dilution in agar or broth. The selection of antibiotics will depend on the organism grown, and the antibiotics that are available locally. To ensure that the results are accurate, the concentration of bacteria that is added to the agar or broth (the inoculum) must be standardized. This is accomplished by comparing the turbidity of bacteria suspended in saline or broth to McFarland standards‚Äîsolutions whose turbidity is equivalent to that of a suspension containing a given concentration of bacteria. Once an appropriate concentration has been reached, which can be determined by visual inspection or by photometry, the inoculum is added to the growth medium. The disc diffusion method involves selecting a strain of bacteria, placing it on an agar plate, and observing bacterial growth near antibiotic-impregnated discs. This is also called the Kirby-Bauer method, although modified methods are also used. Small paper discs containing antibiotics are placed onto a plate upon which bacteria are growing. If the antibiotic inhibits microbial growth, a clear ring, or zone of inhibition, is seen around the disc. The bacteria are classified as sensitive, intermediate, or resistant to an antibiotic by comparing the diameter of the zone of inhibition to defined thresholds which correlate with MICs. Mueller-Hinton agar is frequently used in this antibiotic susceptibility test. Standards exist as to how the testing is performed, and how the test results are interpreted. The CLSI and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) provide standards for the type and depth of agar, temperature of incubation, and method of analysing results. Disc diffusion is considered the cheapest and most simple of the methods used to test for susceptibility, and is easily adapted to testing newly available antibiotics or formulations. Some slow-growing and fastidious bacteria cannot be accurately tested by this method, while others, such as Streptococcus species and Haemophilus influenzae, can be tested but require specialized growth media and incubation conditions. Gradient methods, such as Etest, use a plastic strip placed on agar. A plastic strip impregnated with different concentrations of antibiotics is placed on a growth medium, and the growth medium is viewed after a period of incubation. The minimum inhibitory concentration can be identified based on the intersection of the teardrop-shaped zone of inhibition with the marking on the strip. Multiple strips for different antibiotics may be used. This type of test is considered a diffusion test. In agar and broth dilution methods, bacteria are placed in multiple small tubes with different concentrations of antibiotics. Whether a bacterium is sensitive or not is determined by visual inspection or automatic optical methods, after a period of incubation. Broth dilution is considered the gold standard for phenotypic testing. The lowest concentration of antibiotics that inhibits growth is considered the MIC. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is another method of phenotypic susceptibility testing. This is a form of time-of-flight mass spectrometry, in which the molecules of a bacterium are subject to matrix-assisted laser desorption. The ionised particles are then accelerated, and spectral peaks recorded, producing an expression profile, which is capable of differentiating specific bacterial strains after being compared to known profiles. This includes, in the context of antibiotic susceptibility testing, strains such as beta-lactamase producing E coli. MALDI-TOF is rapid and automated. There are limitations to testing in this format however; results may not match the results of phenotypic testing, and acquisition and maintenance is expensive. Automated systems exist that replicate manual processes, for example, by using pictures and software analysis to report the zone of inhibition in diffusion testing, or dispensing samples and determining results in dilutional testing. =Genetic methods= Genetic testing, such as via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA microarray, DNA chips, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification, may be used to detect whether bacteria possess genes which confer antibiotic resistance. An example is the use of PCR to detect the mecA gene for beta-lactam resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Other examples include assays for testing vancomycin resistance genes vanA and vanB in Enteroccocus species, and antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. These tests have the benefit of being direct and rapid, as compared with observable methods, and have a high likelihood of detecting a finding when there is one to detect. However, whether resistance genes are detected does not always match the resistance profile seen with phenotypic method. The tests are also expensive and require specifically trained personnel. Polymerase chain reaction is a method of identifying genes related to antibiotic susceptibility. In the PCR process, a bacterium's genome is denatured. Primers specific to a sought-after gene are added to a solution containing the DNA, and a DNA polymerase is added alongside a mixture containing molecules that will be needed (for example, nucleotides and ions). If the relevant gene is present, every time this process runs, the quantity of the target gene will be doubled. After this process, the presence of the genes is demonstrated through a variety of methods including electrophoresis, southern blotting, and other DNA sequencing analysis methods. DNA microarrays and chips use the binding of complementary DNA to a target gene or nucleic acid sequence. The benefit of this is that multiple genes can be assessed simultaneously. Reporting The results of the testing are reported as a table, sometimes called an antibiogram. Bacteria might be marked as sensitive, resistant, or having intermediate resistance to an antibiotic. Specific patterns of drug resistance or multi drug resistance may be noted, such as the presence of an extended- spectrum beta lactamase. The sensitive, resistant or intermediate resistance to antibiotics is reported based on the minimum inhibitory concentration. It is compared to known values for a given bacterium and antibiotic. For example, the CLSI defines Streptococcus pneumoniae as sensitive to penicillin if MICs are ‚â§0.06 Œºg/ml, intermediate if MICs are 0.12 to 1 Œºg/ml, and resistant if MICs are ‚â•2 Œºg/ml. Such information may be useful to the clinician, who can change the empiric treatment, to a tailored treatment that is directed only at the causative bacterium. Sometimes, whether an antibiotic is marked as resistant is also based on bacterial characteristics that are associated with known methods of resistance such as the potential for beta-lactamase production.  Clinical practice  Antibiotic resistance tests: Bacteria are streaked on dishes with white disks, each impregnated with a different antibiotic. Clear rings, such as those on the left, show that bacteria have not grown‚Äîindicating that these bacteria are not resistant. The bacteria on the right are fully resistant to all but two of the seven antibiotics tested.Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion Susceptibility Test Protocol , Jan Hudzicki, ASMalt=Two petri dishes with antibiotic resistance tests Ideal antibiotic therapy is based on determining the causal agent and its antibiotic sensitivity. Empiric treatment is often started before laboratory microbiological reports are available. This might be for common or minor infections based on clinical guidelines (such as community-acquired pneumonia), or due to the seriousness of an infection and the risk of treatment delay (such as sepsis or bacterial meningitis). The effectiveness of individual antibiotics varies with the anatomical site of the infection, the ability of the antibiotic to reach the site of infection, and the ability of the bacteria to resist or inactivate the antibiotic. When specimens are taken, this is ideally before treatment is started. A sample may be taken from the site of a suspected infection; such as a blood culture sample when bacteria are suspected to be present in the bloodstream (bacteraemia), a sputum sample in the case of a pneumonia, or a urine sample in the case of a urinary tract infection. Sometimes multiple samples may be taken if the source of an infection is not clear. These samples are transferred to the microbiology laboratory where they are added to culture media where microscopy and sensitivity testing to any bacteria that grow will occur. When antibiotic sensitivity testing is reported, it will report the organisms present in the sample, and which antibiotics they are susceptible to. Although antibiotic sensitivity testing is done in a laboratory (in vitro), the information provided about this is often clinically relevant to the antibiotics in a person (in vivo). Sometimes, decision must be made for some bacteria as to whether they are the cause of an infection, or simply commensal bacteria or contaminants, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and other opportunistic infections. Other considerations may influence the choice of antibiotics, including the need to penetrate through to an infected site (such as an abscess), or the suspicion that one or more causes of an infection were not detected in a sample. History Since the discovery of the beta-lactam antibiotic penicillin, the rates of antimicrobial resistance have increased. Over time, methods for testing the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics have developed and changed. Alexander Fleming in the 1920s developed the first method of susceptibility testing. The \\"gutter method\\" that he developed was a diffusion method, involving an antibiotic that was diffused through a gutter made of agar. In the 1940s, multiple investigators, including Pope, Foster and Woodruff, Vincent and Vincent used paper discs instead. All these methods involve testing only susceptibility to penicillin. The results were difficult to interpret and not reliable, because of inaccurate results that were not standardised between laboratories. Dilution has been used as a method to grow and identify bacteria since the 1870s, and as a method of testing the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics since 1929, also by Alexander Fleming. The way of determining susceptibility changed from how turbid the solution was, to the pH (in 1942), to optical instruments. The use of larger tube-based \\"macrodilution\\" testing has been superseded by smaller \\"microdilution\\" kits. In 1966, the World Health Organisation confirmed the Kirby-Bauer method as the standard method for susceptibility testing; it is simple, cost-effective and can test multiple antibiotics. The Etest was developed in 1980 by Bolmstr”ßm and Eriksson, and MALDI-TOF developed in 2000s. An array of automated systems has been developed since and after the 1980s. PCR was the first genetic test available and first published as a method of detecting antibiotic susceptibility in 2001.  Further research  Point-of- care testing is being developed to speed up the time for testing, and to help practitioners avoid prescribing unnecessary antibiotics in the style of precision medicine. Traditional techniques typically take between 12 and 48 hours, although it can take up to five days. In contrast, rapid testing using molecular diagnostics is defined as \\"being feasible within an 8-h(our) working shift\\". Progress has been slow due to a range of reasons including cost and regulation. Additional research is focused at the shortcomings of current testing methods. As well as the duration it takes to report phenotypic methods, they are laborious, have difficult portability and are difficult to use in resource-limited settings, and have a chance of cross-contamination. As of 2017, point-of-care resistance diagnostics were available for methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) through GeneXpert by molecular diagnostics company Cepheid. Quantitative PCR, with the view of determining the percent of a detected bacteria that possesses a resistance gene, is being explored. Whole genome sequencing of isolated bacteria is also being explored, and likely to become more available as costs decrease and speed increases over time. Additional methods explored include microfluidics, which uses a small amount of fluid and a variety of testing methods, such as optical, electrochemical, and magnetic. Such assays do not require much fluid to be tested, are rapid and portable. The use of fluorescent dyes has been explored. These involve labelled proteins targeted at biomarkers, nucleic acid sequences present within cells that are found when the bacterium is resistant to an antibiotic. An isolate of bacteria is fixed in position and then dissolved. The isolate is then exposed to fluoresent dye, which will be luminescent when viewed. Improvements to existing platforms are also being explored, including improvements in imaging systems that are able to more rapidly identify the MIC in phenotypic samples; or the use of bioluminescent enzymes that reveal bacterial growth to make changes more easily visible.

Founded in 1974, PTV is the main brand of People's Television Network, Inc. (PTNI), one of the attached agencies under the Presidential Communications Operations Office (PCOO). PTV, along with sister media companies Radio Philippines Network (minority-owned) and Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation, and radio network Philippine Broadcasting Service, forms the media arm of the PCOO. Its head office, studios and transmitter are located at Broadcast Complex, Visayas Avenue, Barangay Vasra, Diliman, Quezon City. As a government-run station, PTV receives funding from the General Appropriations Act (Annual National Budget) and sales from blocktimers and advertisers, among others. PTV also run Muslim- oriented digital television channel Salaam TV. History The country's government television network began operations on February 2, 1974 as Government Television (GTV-4), a division of the National Media Production Center. The government channel was first headed by Lito Gorospe and later by Press Secretary Francisco Tatad. It was first headquartered in the Solana Building in Intramuros, Manila and later relocated to the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City. In 1978, it began color broadcasts, the last national network to do so. GTV was renamed Maharlika Broadcasting System (MBS) in 1980 under the leadership of Minister of Information Gregorio Cenda√±a. By then, it began expanding with the opening of provincial stations nationwide, including 3 stations in Cebu, Bacolod, and Davao who once owned by pre-martial law ABS-CBN. Following the People Power Revolution in 1986 on which it was taken over by pro-Corazon Aquino soldiers and supporters, it was, during that very historic event in national history, officially rebranded as People's Television (PTV) two months later in April. Broadcasters Tina Monz√≥n- Palma and Jos√© Mari V√©lez were tapped by President Corazon Aquino to handle the newly-rebranded station for a few months, before they were taken back to GMA 7. It later became the national network for the broadcasts of the 1988 Summer Olympics along with RPN. On March 26, 1992, President Cory Aquino signed Republic Act 7306 turning PTV Network into a government corporation known formally as People's Television Network, Inc. Shortly after he took over the mantle of government in June 1992, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed PTV Network's first board of directors. The Network was given a one-time equity funding for capital outlay. Since 1992, PTV has been operating on revenues it generates on its own. Republic Act 7306 stipulates that the government shall not appropriate funds for the operations of the Network . PTNI is on full satellite transmission nationwide since 1992 using PALAPA C2. Its flagship station PTV-4, which is based in Quezon City, boasts of a 40-kilowatt brand- new transmitter sitting on a tower. With its 32 provincial stations across the country, the network has extended its reach and coverage to approximately 85 percent of the television viewing public nationwide. Logo of PTV in 1995 So far, PTNI has come up with the kind of programs that have earned for itself the Hall of Fame Award for Best Station and for Most Balanced Programming in 1987 and two succeeding years thereafter, from the Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA). It has, to its name, several pioneering and award-winning educational, cultural and public service programs for their relevance and production excellence. In 1996, PTV won the award for Best TV Station ID (\\"Ang Network Para Sa Pilipino\\" [lit. The Network For The Filipino]) in the PMPC Star Awards for Television. PTNI has pioneered educational and cultural programming. Some of its award-winning programs were Tele-aralan ng Kakayahan (which predated ABS-CBN's The Knowledge Channel by decades), Ating Alamin, Small World (and its successor) Kidsongs, For Art's Sake, Coast to Coast and Paco Park Presents. In the 1990s, at the core of its educational programming is the Continuing Studies via Television or CONSTEL, a program aimed at upgrading teaching skills of elementary and secondary teachers of Science and English. Institutionalized by Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), CONSTEL Science and English are being used in teacher training by the Regional and Divisional Leader Schools of the Department of Education, culture and Sports and in Teacher Education Institutions of the Commission on Higher Education. PTNI has also been the official broadcaster of major international sports competitions. It has covered the Olympic Games, starting with the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, except Barcelona Olympics in 1992 (covered by ABS- CBN), the Beijing Olympics in 2008 (covered by Solar Entertainment Corporation), London Olympics in 2012 and the Rio Olympics in 2016 (covered by TV5). PTNI was the carrying station of the South East Asian Games in 1991, 1995, 2005, and 2007, missing from 2009, and resuming at 2017; Asian Games from 1986 to 2006 and the IAAF World Championships in Athletics in 2007 and 2009. During these coverage, PTNI has received commendations from various sports organizations. In 1996, it received a presidential citation from then President Fidel V. Ramos for the successful coverage of the Atlanta Olympic Games. On March 1997, PTV renewed its congressional franchise for a period of 25 years. Under Philippine law, no broadcast company can operate without franchise from the Philippine congress, an authority that limits and regulates operations of telecommunications and broadcast media such as televisions and radios. NBN logo from 2007-2011; the NBN wordmark is used from 2001-2011.On July 16, 2001, under the new management appointed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, PTNI adopted the new image and name National Broadcasting Network (NBN) carrying a new slogan \\"One People. One Nation. One Vision.\\" for a new image in line with its new programming thrusts, they continued the new name until the Aquino administration in 2010. NBN expanded its broadcast reach with the launching of NBN World on February 19, 2003 in cooperation with the Television and Radio Broadcasting Service (TARBS). This global expansion signals new directions for NBN as it becomes accessible to the rest of the world, particularly the millions of Filipinos overseas. NBN can be seen in Australia, North America and the Asia-Pacific. NBN is previously transmitting via satellite nationwide using Agila 2 then moved to ABS 1 (now ABS 2) last September 2011 (Now in Telstar 18 as of present time). Before the year 2010, NBN main studios in Quezon City and its regional stations in Baguio, Cebu and Naga will be equipped with the most modern news gathering equipment for them to compete with the major television networks. Also, a new Harris Transmitter has been installed. NBN's transmitter power shall be increased from 40 kW to 60 kW (However, few years later, in 2013, the network was downgraded its transmitting power output from 60 kW to 50 kW later then back to 40 kW or 25 kW in June 2016 to control power costs). NBN's digital channel is now available on channel 48 (now moved to channel 42) using the Japanese digital TV standard. In 2011, NBN continued to enhance its digital broadcasting capabilities with equipment donated from the Japanese government. This equipment will also allow NBN to begin broadcasting emergency alerts when necessary (similar to the Emergency Alert System in the United States, but it is more likely, due to the usage of the Japanese digital TV standard, that the system would be based on the Japanese J-Alert system). Station logo from 2011-2012 Although the branding is officially known as the National Broadcasting Network, in August 2011, the \\"People's Television\\" brand which was retired in 2001 was reintroduced as a secondary brand until a few months later, PTNI became a primary brand, and the branding National Broadcasting Network was retired. On July 2, 2012, PTV launched its new logo and its new slogan \\"Telebisyon ng Bayan (lit. People's Television)\\" with a Balangay station ID. PTV logo used from July 2, 2012 to April 2, 2017 In March 2013, President Benigno Aquino III signed Republic Act 10390, superseding the old Charter, in which the management will be under reorganization and the government will infuse P5 billion to PTV to revitalize the station and make it \\"digital competitive\\" in spite of GMA Network's questionings of the law, fearing that it may enter competition.

Despite being operated with little or no budget, the new PTV had still managed to cover the biggest events in the country including the 2013 National and Local Elections, 2013 Central Visayas earthquake, Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana), the visits of US President Barack Obama and Pope Francis, the APEC Philippines 2015.Our Story and the 2016 National and Local Elections. PTV also reintroduced its broadcast of the station's digital clock embedded on the lower left part of the screen in 2013, 7 years after Radio Philippines Network abandoned its longstanding practice for 32 years. In 2005, several Radio ng Bayan programs were also aired on then NBN with the Visayas Avenue studios used for some of them, under the Tinig ng Bayan banner. In 2014, the partnership between the two was revived with an all new morning news program, RadyoBisyon, which is also simulcast on IBC-13 and heard in Radyo ng Bayan stations nationwide, broadcasting from its own studios and the RnB radio booth. Before the launch, RnB - as part of the Philippine Broadcasting Service - had already, since 2012, been simulcasting News @ 1 and News @ 6 on radio on all its stations. =Recent developments= PTV transitional/main logo, which was created by LA, was used from April 3 to June 27, 2017; still seen as on- screen secondary logo since June 28. Under the guidance of Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar, the network will undertake a major revitalization plan to improve the station's programming and expand its nationwide presence, to be at par with state-media outfits BBC of United Kingdom, NHK of Japan, PBS of the United States of America, CBC of Canada and ABC Australia and to bring back its glorious years as one of the Top 5 television networks in the country in the 1970s and 1980s. He will be also implement editorial independence in the station. Andanar noted that teams from state-owned networks ABC and BBC will be sent to the Philippines to help with PTV's revitalization plan. He also tapped a former executive of ABS-CBN News, Charie Villa, to oversee the news division of PTV-4. However, Villa turned down the offer due to her strong opposition on key national issues. In June, President-elect Rodrigo Duterte stated that he will no longer conduct press conferences, and instead air announcements and press releases through PTV. Two months later, his promise was retracted, and the press interviews and conferences resumed on the channel. On June 17, 2016, the PTV and Japan signed a 38.20 million yen worth of Cultural Grant Aid and acquisition of programs from NHK to improve the network's overall programming. Within weeks, NHK's Japan Video Topics returned to the channel after several years. However, 1 year later on July 11, 2017, PTV and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) signed an agreement on another cultural grant aid for the planned broadcast of 600 educational and cultural programs from Japanese state-owned broadcaster NHK in the channel thru the ISDB-T digital TV standard. On July 7, 2016, PTNI Chairperson Maria Cristina C. Mariano, PTNI Vice-Chairperson Veronica Baluyut-Jimenez, Network General Manager Albert D. Bocobo, and Board Directors Josemaria Claro and Cindy Rachelle Igmat, all appointed during the Aquino administration, tendered their resignation to Duterte through Andanar. and followed by the \\"Telebisyon ng Bayan\\" slogan was dropped from the logo, retaining the 2012 PTV logo until April 2, 2017. 3 days later, former PTNI acting News and Administrative Division head, Alex Rey V. Pal takes over as Officer in Charge of the network temporary and while Bocobo retains as General Manager of the Network until November 24, 2016. Andanar also announced the appointment of Dino Antonio C. Apolonio, former Vice President for Production Engineering of TV5 as the incoming Network General Manager. However, 4 months later, on November 25, 2016, it was officially announced that PTV named Apolonio was appointed as the Network General Manager replacing Bocobo and he also assumed as Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the network, while the network's board member Claro was also appointed as Network Vice Chairperson. GOCC Undersecretary George Apacible announced during the network's Christmas party on December 20, 2016 that PTV sets its sights to notch higher in the television ratings by 2017 as the network targets the #3 spot currently held by TV5. On January 4, 2017, PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar announced that PTV's transmitter power output was increased from 25 kW to 60 kW for a clearer and better signal reception. On January 12, 2017, PTV and Japan-based IT company NEC signed an agreement for the commissioning of new digital transmitters and head-end system for the network's transition to digital terrestrial television. The network is all set to roll-out its digital terrestrial television service initially on six locations in the Philippines by introducing DTT transmitters and compression multiplexers in Manila, Baguio, Naga, Guimaras, Cebu and Davao in the Philippines by July 2017. 1 year later on January 10, 2018, Minister for Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan Seiko Noda and PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar together with PCOO officials visited at the PTV studios in Quezon City for the ceremonial Switch on of PTV's Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcast. A new logo of PTV, which was conceptualized by former PTV senior graphic artist LA (replacing its 2012 version), was previewed on the March 11, 2017 edition of PTV Newsbreak in the occasion of the inauguration of the station's Cordillera hub in Baguio. Along with the inauguration, the government turned over brand-new Outside Broadcast and Digital Satellite News Gathering Vans. The inauguration was led by President Duterte and PCO Secretary Martin Andanar. The transition to the new logo started on April 3 of the same year, when PTV released its wordmark logo, its corresponding station ID, and new graphics. Finally, its official logo, which represents the elements of the Philippine flag and also previewed at the inauguration of its very own Cordillera hub, was launched upon the station's sign-on on June 28, 2017. The network also launched its new slogan \\"Para sa Bayan (lit. For the Nation)\\", which was already used since July 2016 (prior to the re-branding). On June 3, 2017, PTV began simulcasting CGTN programs, part of its staff having visited its facilities earlier in the year as part of a number of training visits to state and private TV channels worldwide, and later started their full-blown broadcast in 1080i Full HD on their Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcast on April 18, 2018. A year since the network introduced their new logo, the new-look PTV was relaunched to the public in a trade launch on July 12, 2018 at the Marquis Events Place, Taguig City. During the trade launch, the network showcased their technological achievements since the new administration took over the network's operations in 2016, from upgrading the technical and transmission equipment into HD and Digital TV‚Äìready to their social media presence and their revitalized program line-up from news & public affairs programs, local newscasts from Cordillera and Davao, documentaries, sports, entertainment, and public service shows co- produced by the network and their partner government agencies, along with upcoming local and foreign programs, including those from China, Japan, South Korea and the ASEAN Region. PTV went on a major visual facelift with the airing of their new Station ID entitled \\"Kasama Mo, Para sa Bayan\\" (lit. Your Companion, For The Nation), which started on the following day. In his first State of the Nation Address, President Rodrigo Duterte proposed the creation of a law that will merge and integrate the People's Television Network and the Philippine Broadcasting Service into a single entity, to be called the People's Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), similar to the BBC. The proposed PBC will also launch the country's first Specialty channels for the Muslim minority (Salaam TV) and the Lumad peoples of the south. PBC will also put up TV broadcasting hubs in Visayas and Mindanao, aside from its main headquarters in Luzon and TV broadcast studios within its major cities. Salaam TV began test broadcasting on July 10, 2017. Programming Generally, PTV airs locally produced news and public affairs programs and documentaries, sports, public service and entertainment programs, in addition of foreign content coming from their counterparts from China, Japan, South Korea and the ASEAN‚Äìmember countries, and blocktime programs. The network serves as the main television broadcast arm of the government of the Republic of the Philippines and it is part of the Presidential Communications Operations Office. Its programming is diverse from other state-controlled network IBC since PTV focuses on its function as the government's voice, while IBC is the general entertainment channel which also airs replays of select PTV programs. PTV Stations Nationwide PTV Website The PTV Website is another initiative of People's Television Network to reach out to all Filipinos worldwide using the internet.

History =The beginnings= Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation was established in October 1959 when DZTV Channel 13 in Manila went its test broadcast. On March 1, 1960 at 6:30pm, DZTV-TV 13 was finally launched and it became as the third television station in the country after the monopoly of DZAQ-TV of ABS and DZXL-TV of CBN owned by the Lopez family's Bolinao Electronics Corporation (now ABS-CBN Corporation). Its original location was at the corner of P. Guevara St. (formerly Little Baguio) in San Juan City from 1960 to 1978. American businessman Dick Baldwin was the station's first owner and programming consisted of mostly foreign programs from American television network CBS and a few local shows. Andr√©s Soriano, Sr. of San Miguel Corporation, would acquire the network in 1962. Soriano was also a majority owner of the Radio Mindanao Network (RMN) and The Philippine Herald newspaper. Soriano's combined media interests formed the first tri-media organization in the Philippines. As the television arm of the RMN, it partnered with the RMN radio stations for coverages of the general elections of 1969 and 1971. The station had relay transmitters to bring its programs to viewers in Cebu and Davao, with plans to open more in other cities. In between 1970 and 1972, IBC launched its color transmission system named \\"Vinta Color\\" named after the vintas from Zamboanga, becoming the third network in the Philippines to convert to all-color broadcasts, after ABS-CBN and KBS. In September 1972, then-President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law at the entire country, resulting IBC and other television networks (except KBS which was owned by Roberto Benedicto) were forced to shut down by the government. However, a few months later, IBC allowed by the government to return on the air. ABS-CBN veteran Ben Aniceto became the station manager of DZTV Channel 13 from 1973 to 1976. =Relaunch and the glory years= On February 1, 1975, during the martial law era and the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, due to a constitutional limitation prohibiting the ownership of media by non-Filipinos or corporations not 100% Filipino owned, the network was acquired by a Marcos crony named Roberto Benedicto (who also owned Kanlaon Broadcasting System, which later renamed as Radio Philippines Network or RPN and the now-defunct Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation or BBC) and was renamed Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC). IBC would launch an FM station DWKB-FM the same year. Marking the relaunch, the network debuted its vinta logo (which would be used until 1978 in two iterations). In 1976, IBC metamorphosed into one of the country's most viewed TV network with its primetime lineup and full length local and foreign films aired on this channel. This catapulted IBC in the number one slot among the four rival networks and also emphasized itself as the birthplace of the golden age of Philippine television, with many top series headlined by hit stars on radio, TV and film. Among its top-rated shows were Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film series of Tarzan that starred Johnny Weissmuller, showbiz talk shows See-True and Seeing Stars hosted by Inday Badiday and Joe Quirino respectively, and comedy shows Iskul Bukol, Chicks to Chicks, and T.O.D.A.S.: Television's Outrageously Delightful All-Star Show. Through the blood and sweat of its employees and the income generated from its programs, the network built and finally moved to its present home at the modern Broadcast City, together with its sister networks RPN and BBC in July 1978. The complex was a tract located at Capitol Hills, Diliman, Quezon City. At the same time, IBC moved its transmitter to San Francisco Del Monte, Quezon City to replace the old transmitter in San Juan. By 1985, however, IBC would become second to RPN, albeit with many great local and foreign programs that were popular among viewers. =Post-EDSA Revolution, sequestration, E13, and Pusong Pinoy, Pusong Trese= After the People Power Revolution (also known as the EDSA Revolution) which ousted the dictatorial president Ferdinand Marcos and install Corazon Aquino as the new president of the Philippines, IBC, with 20 television stations that time, together with RPN and BBC was sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government for allegedly being part of the crony capitalism under the Marcos regime. A board of administrators was created to run the station. When it became a state channel a new logo debuted featuring IBC and 13 on separate circles, a revamp of an earlier logo which debuted in 1978‚Äì79. The new slogan \\"Basta Pinoy sa Trese\\" was in a circle to commemorate the People Power Revolution. President Corazon Aquino turned over IBC and RPN to the Government Communications Group and awarded BBC's Channel 2 frequency through an executive order to ABS-CBN. When BBC closed down, both IBC and RPN absorbed majority of its displaced employees, thus doubled the operating expenses of the network. Cost of programs went up three-fold. Line- produced shows and co-production ventures with some big film companies like Viva, Regal, and Seiko were favored, aside from their station-produced programs. The top-rated shows of IBC were pirated by rival networks, however, it scored a victory when it acquired the then ABS-CBN program \\"Loveli-Ness\\" in 1988, starring Alma Moreno. Cost of programs, talent fees and TV rights increased tremendously. IBC could no longer afford to produce its own shows, save for its news and current affairs programming and special events. In 1987, IBC was renamed as E13 and adopted a new slogan, \\"Life Begins at 13\\", noted for the butterfly logo in the form of the letter E and the number 13. By then, IBC had struggled to cope with the increased competition from the other networks, particularly from ABS-CBN which skyrocketed to number 1 by 1988. In 1989, the IBC brand returned after two years. The network adopted a new image at the same year, \\"Pusong Pinoy, Pusong Trese\\" (Heart of Filipino, Heart of Thirteen), to recapture the glory days it once had. But because of the sequestration, periodic change of management and the internal problems, the network started to lose the support from its advertisers. =Islands TV-13= Islands Broadcast Corporation under Mr. Alfonso Denoga and Mr. Gil Balaguer took over the management and the marketing of IBC 13 (which was branded as Islands TV-13, pronounced on air as Islands TV one-three) in October 1990, at the time when IBC 13 was dead last in the ratings. The new logo features three triangles and a slogan, \\"The Newest Network\\" adorn on the logo. It was in the later part of its operations that ratings and income suffered due to mismanagement which caused labor unrest. In March 1993, the Makati City RTC issued the court order stopping Islands Broadcast Corporation as the marketing and sales agent of IBC 13 due to unpaid financial obligations to the network as the contract of Islands expired on February 28, 1993. =Return of operations, Pinoy ang Dating and Vintage Television= Logo used from May 27, 1994 to December 31, 2001. The design of the stylized \\"13\\" is a descendant of the one found in the station logo design used in the 1970s and 1980s. In October 1992, Islands TV-13 was rebranded back to IBC and became a 100% government-owned station by virtue of a compromise agreement between PCGG and Roberto Benedicto. The management and marketing were returned to IBC's board of directors. The programming remained at a standstill in preparation for the launching of a new image of the station. It was on May 27, 1994 when IBC launched its new slogan \\"\\" () with a Filipino-like visually enticing music video featuring Grace Nono, an innovation in terms of station identification. Despite limited resources, programming improved but the battle for audience share continued. Advertisers became more responsive to marketing efforts. The following year, IBC began to broadcast its programs via satellite nationwide. Soon after, IBC landed 4th place in primetime ratings. In 1996, Vintage Enterprises transferred to IBC as part of the launching of Vintage Television (VTV), a primetime block that aired on IBC with PBA, Blow by Blow and other Vintage Sports-produced programs after moving from another government-owned station, People's Television Network (PTV). The block helped IBC-13 land third in the primetime ratings, mainly credited to the airing of the PBA games. At the same time, IBC also installed a new Harris 60-kilowatt transmitter in San Francisco del Monte for clearer TV reception, and utilized the services of the APSTAR 1 Satellite for a broader international reach. Later in the year 2000, Viva Entertainment's subsidiary Viva Television acquired Vintage Enterprises (including VTV on IBC block) from the Velez family and changed its name to Viva TV, a primetime sports and entertainment block on IBC which continued until 2002. Rehabilitation of the transmitter and other technical facilities were initiated in the network's flagship and provincial stations. On September 2, 2000, Republic Act No. 8954 renewed IBC its congressional franchise for another 25 years. In the same year, the network scored a major victory with the top-rated Philippine franchise of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. On January 1, 2002, IBC launched its new logo and its new slogan \\"New Face, New Attitude\\" with a new station ID. However, in early 2003, Viva TV on IBC was ended after Viva decided not to renew a blocktime agreement with IBC due to high blocktime costs and low ratings. Despite this, the grand finals of Star for a Night which saw Sarah Geronimo as its winner, its last Viva TV-produced program was aired on IBC on March 1, 2003. Logo used from December 12, 2003 to June 4, 2011. On December 12, 2003, IBC launched again its new logo and its new slogan \\"Ang Bagong Pilipino\\" (The New Filipino) with a freestyle station ID. In late 2007, IBC inked a deal with the Makisig Network, led by Hermie Esguerra, as a primetime block-timer of IBC. However, Makisig Network's programs were not aired due to questions on the propriety of the terms and conditions of the agreement. Said agreement expired in October 2008. =Abandonment and privatization= After four decades of serving the network's dominance and entertainment programing, IBC-13's studios and facilities are abandoned due to negligence and their network's mismanagement. Their studio equipment, cameras, lighting and props are useless, dilapidated and very old. Cash and budgets were cut short and they cannot afford to utilize radio-TV operations. Their programming and airtime were lost after suffering from a network war in the late 1980s and the 1990s and many employees lost their jobs. The network suffered more than 800 million pesos worth of back wages to its employees, some of them are old-timers or those who worked in the network since the 1980s. At present, IBC 13 has 200 regular employees as of 2016, while 29 of those are talents or in a \\"contractual basis\\", particularly from the news and public affairs and production. The management tried to revive the ill-fated network but it failed thereafter over a span of 30 years and five Philippine presidents (Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and Benigno Aquino III).

Retrieved May 14, 2013. and there have been doubts about the future of the network. In 2012, in pursuant to AO No. 26, IBC handed over its archives to Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP) for its restoration. IBC recently signed a memorandum of agreement with the Asian Television Content Corporation under Engr. Reynaldo Sanchez as the major blocktimer of the station. ATC @ IBC primetime block with newest programs premiered last June 2, 2014. However, on August 31, 2014, programs under the ATC @ IBC 13 block suddenly no longer aired on the network, possibly due to poor ratings and lack of advertisers' support. PCOO Secretary Herminio Coloma, Jr. said in a Senate budget hearing for the PCOO last September 3, 2014 that the network will be fully privatized before President Aquino stepping down in the office in 2016 and keeping PTV-4 as the sole government TV network. Process of the privatization will be managed by the Governance Commission for Government-Owned or -Controlled Corporations through the Development Bank of the Philippines. Business tycoon Manny V. Pangilinan is one of the possible bidders for the privatization in which TV5 (a media company under PLDT's MediaQuest Holdings through ABC Development Corporation), despite expiration of blocktime agreement in 2013 (AKTV), is still using IBC's Broadcast City facilities for sports events, including its 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup coverage. However, MediaQuest also could not join the privatization bid due to ownership rules and regulations that MediaQuest owns TV5 and AksyonTV. On June 2, 2015, the Philippine Crusader for Justice (PCJ), led by Joe Villanueva, filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the Philippines to nullify the joint venture agreement between IBC and Primestate/R-II Builders for the development of 3.5 hectares of Broadcast City, after the Office of the Ombudsman found the contract to be disadvantageous to the government. The Ombudsman filed a graft case in 2013 against former IBC executives and Primestate. In January 2016, President Benigno Aquino III, through the Governance Commission for Government-owned and -controlled corporation (GCG) approved the planned privatization of IBC. The privatization will be undergo public bidding with an estimated floor price of 10 billion pesos. The proceeds of the bidding will be for the increase of state-owned PTV-4's capital to upgrade and modernize their broadcast capabilities. The Development Bank of the Philippines will be the financial adviser for the privatization. Incoming PCOO secretary Martin Andanar has already forwarded the privatization plan to President Rodrigo Duterte's executive secretary Salvador Medialdea. Andanar will also coordinate with the GCG before the start of the bidding. The privatization process of IBC was commenced in October 2016. As of December 2016, five groups have already showed their interest to join the bidding process. These are Ramon S. Ang of San Miguel Corporation and the groups of former IBC president (and current RMN president and chief executive officer) Eric Canoy and former Ilocos Sur governor Chavit Singson, energy tycoon and Udenna Corporation chairman Dennis Uy (who recently expanded his business through his recent acquisition of ISM Communications Corporation) and William Lima, a businessman from Davao. In March 2017, IBC operated on a low powered signal but it continues its broadcast on cable and satellite providers. In October 2017, IBC began its test broadcast on digital terrestrial television. =Relaunch and recent developments= In late 2018, IBC began to revitalize its infrastructure and its programming after DOT Undersecretary of Tourism Advocacy and Public Affairs Kat de Castro appointed as president and chief executive officer of the network replaced Manolito O. Cruz (who passed away in October 10 of the same year). By December of the same year, the network transferred its studios and offices to a new building at Capitol Hills Drive corner Zuzuarregui Street, Barangay Matandang Balara, Quezon City (a property beside Broadcast City) to give way for the redevelopment of the Broadcast City property into the Larossa Condominium project of Primehomes Real Estate Development Inc. IBC also upgraded its Roosevelt Avenue analog transmitter for the Mega Manila area. On February 11, 2019, IBC announced a major revamp of its programming, the first since the ATC@IBC block in 2014. It includes reruns of IBC's old entertainment and cultural shows, introduction of documentary and current affairs programs airing from sister station People's Television Network, and other entertainment and sports content from SMAC Television Productions and ATC, among others. IBC also got two new slogans namely, \\"Iconic.Bold.Chill\\" and \\"Kaibigan Mo!\\" In March 2020, IBC announced the suspension of telecasting their selected regular programs, this is due to President Rodrigo Duterte implementing an enhanced community quarantine in Metro Manila and Luzon in line with the growing COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Thus, the network airs Public Briefing: #LagingHandaPH by PCOO and the Department of Health Virtual Presser and will be airing educational programs by Department of Education's DepEd TV on October 5.

As a young player, Munaron started as the keeper of the youth team of FC Dinant, and Munaron stayed in Dinant and became a player of the A-team. FC Dinant played in the Third Division at that time. In 1974, Munaron was discovered by RSC Anderlecht and moved to Brussels. Over there, he was only a substitute player, as Jan Ruiter, the Dutch keeper of Anderlecht, was the first choice of the trainer. Also later, when Anderlecht bought Nico de Bree, another Dutch player of RWDM, Munaron was a substitute player. Nevertheless, Munaron sometimes got some chances to play and quickly became the real number one of Anderlecht. Ruiter left in 1977 and De Bree was sold in 1980, but Munaron stayed. Munaron stayed in total 15 seasons in Anderlecht, from 1974 until 1989. He was four times national champion with Anderlecht and won the Belgian Cup four times. He also played as Anderlecht won the 1983 UEFA Cup Final. In 1988 the competition within the team was stronger again. Munaron became older and Anderlecht picked the younger keeper Filip De Wilde more frequently. As a result, Munaron moved to Club Li√®ge in 1989. At Li√®ge he won another Belgian Cup in 1990. In 1992 Standard de Li√®ge wanted to buy Munaron from Club Li√®ge and Munaron made the move. The keeper was 36 years at that time and became a substitute, because Gilbert Bodart was the first keeper at Standard in the early '90s. In 1995 Munaron joined Eendracht Aalst, but in 1996 he decided to retire. He played eight times for the Belgium national team throughout his career. After his career as a player, Munaron became a trainer. He was keeper-trainer of Belgium, RSC Anderlecht and the Turkish team Trabzonspor. From the season 2010‚Äì11 he worked for AA Gent, but at the start of 2014‚Äì15 he left the club. He went to FCV Dender to become goalkeeper coach. After this adventure he became the goalkeeper coach of Royal Excelsior Mouscron (Belgian first division). At the end of the season 2016‚Äì2017 Munaron was pushed away from REM in a very disrespectful manner, making him decide to leave football and choose a new challenge, namely Futsal. As of 1 July 2017, Munaron became a goalkeeper coach at FP Halle-Gooik (a Belgian top club who has become champion in the first grade of Futsal in the last 3 years). Again, he will be able to enjoy football again at a high level, as FP Halle-Gooik also participates in the Futsal Champions League.

The prototype first flew in October 1973. It was produced initially by Molino Oy who were taken over by Eiri-Avion Oy (Currently Eirikuva Oy between 1974 and 1980. Later, production was taken over by the French company, Siren SA, under the name Siren PIK-20. At first it was classified as a Standard Class glider, which at the time allowed flaps instead of air-brakes for approach control. The specification of the Standard Class required full air-brakes capable of keeping the speed below the maximum speed in a vertical dive. However at high speed great force was needed to lower the flaps and so a geared crank handle was used. The first prototype finished 13th in the World Gliding Championships in Waikerie in January 1974 but it performed impressively. (The low placing was caused by a poor decision on the first day of the competition.) This yellow prototype glider (OH-425) can be seen in movie named \\"Zulu Romeo - Good start\\" about this 1974 World Gliding Championship. The glider was then produced at the rate of two to three per week. The rules of the Standard Class were changed again to allow the flaps and ailerons to move together (flaperons) and for intermediate settings of the flaps between landing mode and zero. The result was the PIK-20B which won British, American and Finnish National Championships in 1975. In 1976 Ingo Renner won the World Championship with a PIK-20B and second and third places were also taken by this type. Most owners of PIK-20A converted to the B's flaperon arrangements. Carbon fiber spars later became standard. Another change in the Standard Class rules prohibited flaps completely. As a result, the PIK 20C was produced for the new 15 meter class. PIK 20D added conventional Schempp-Hirth airbrakes, carbon reinforcement strips at critical locations in the fuselage, the nose profile was sharpened, the tail-plane was moved forward and fuselage fairings recontoured to reduce drag. The flaps were limited to -12 to +20 degrees. The first flight of the D was in 1976. The self-launching PIK-20E is similar to the D model, but has a retractable Rotax 501 that takes 15 turns of a manual crank in the cockpit to deploy or retract. The fuselage is slightly different, with a slight sweep-back of the wings and the tailplane is larger. The Issoire Company in France produced a 17-metre PIK-30 version of the E. Unlike the PIK 20, the PIK 30 could not be winch- launched or fly with full negative flaps. A PIK-20F had a modified wing profile, reshaped fuselage and a forward opening canopy. The PIK-20s were also notable for being conventionally painted rather than using gel-coat. (The prototype was bright yellow.) This type of finish is longer-lasting and simpler to repair. The name PIK is an acronym for Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho, the flying club of the Student Union of Helsinki University of Technology. A fire in the factory June 1977 dented production briefly but by then 200 gliders had been sold. Production continued until about 1985 with the D and E versions with over 400 examples of the type having been completed.

The Coalition Provisional Authority voted to create the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST), consisting of five Iraqi judges, on 9 December 2003, to try Saddam Hussein and his aides for charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Saddam was captured by U.S. forces on 13 December 2003. He remained in custody by United States forces at Camp Cropper in Baghdad, along with eleven senior Ba'athist officials. Particular attention was paid during the trial to activities in violent campaigns against the Kurds in the north during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, against the Shiites in the south in 1991 and 1999 to put down revolts, and in Dujail after a failed assassination attempt on 8 July 1982, during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Saddam asserted in his defense that he had been unlawfully overthrown, and was still the president of Iraq. The first trial began before the Iraqi Special Tribunal on 19 October 2005. At this trial Saddam and seven other defendants were tried for crimes against humanity with regard to events that took place after a failed assassination attempt in Dujail in 1982 by members of the Islamic Dawa Party (see also human rights abuses in Iraq under Saddam Hussein). A second and separate trial began on 21 August 2006, trying Saddam and six co- defendants for genocide during the Anfal military campaign against the Kurds of northern Iraq. On 5 November 2006, Saddam was sentenced to death by hanging. On 26 December, Saddam's appeal was rejected and the death sentence upheld. No further appeals were taken and Saddam was ordered executed within 30 days of that date. The date and place of the execution were secret until the sentence was carried out. Saddam Hussein was executed by hanging on 30 December 2006. With his death, all other charges were dropped. Critics viewed the trial as a show trial that did not meet international standards on the right to a fair trial. Amnesty International stated that the trial was \\"unfair,\\"Amnesty International  Working to Protect Human Rights and Human Rights Watch judged that Saddam's execution \\"follows a flawed trial and marks a significant step away from the rule of law in Iraq.\\"Iraq: Saddam Hussein Put to Death, Human Rights Watch (30-12-2006). Several months before the trial took place, Salem Chalabi, the former head of the Iraq Special Tribunal (which was established to try Hussein), accused interim Iraqi Prime Minister Iyad Allawi of pushing for a hasty show trial and execution, stating: \\"Show trials followed by speedy executions may help the interim government politically in the short term but will be counterproductive for the development of democracy and the rule of law in Iraq in the long term.\\" First hearing: 1 July 2004 The 67-year-old President, Saddam Hussein, appeared confident and defiant throughout the 46-minute hearing. Alternating between listening to and gesturing at the judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin, he questioned the legitimacy of the tribunal set up to try him. He called the court a \\"play\\" aimed at Bush's chances of winning the US presidential elections.\\"Saddam defiant in court\\" , 2 July 2004, Al-Jazeera. He emphatically rejected charges against him. \\"This is all theater. The real criminal is Bush\\", he stated.\\"Know Nothing, Do Nothing\\" , The American Spectator, 11 October 2005. When asked by the judge to identify himself in his first appearance before an Iraqi judge (three of the five judges and the prosecutor were never identified nor photographed for security reasons), he answered, \\"You are an Iraqi, you know who I am.\\"\\"You are an Iraqi. You know who I am\\", The Guardian, 20 October 2005. Also during the arraignment, Saddam defended Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait and referred to Kuwaitis as \\"dogs\\" who were trying to turn the women of Iraq into \\"two-penny whores\\", which led to an admonition from the judge for using coarse language in court. Later on 1 July, Kuwait's information minister Abul-Hassan said crude language was \\"expected\\" of Saddam. \\"This is how he was raised\\", said the minister.Saddam upsets Kuwaiti 'dogs' at Mail & Guardian online Although no attorneys for Saddam were present at the 1 July hearing, his first wife, Sajida Talfah, hired a multinational legal team of attorneys, headed by Jordanian Mohammad Rashdan and including Ayesha Gaddafi (Libya), Curtis Doebbler (United States), Emmanuel Ludot (France) and Marc Henzelin (Switzerland). Towards the end of the first hearing, the deposed president refused to sign the legal document confirming his understanding of the charges. Pre-trial events In a leaked transcript of a February 2003 meeting between Bush and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Aznar, Bush expressed a willingness to have Saddam tried at the International Tribunal of Justice in The Hague.Wikisource:Bush-Aznar memo In December 2004, Clive Stafford Smith prepared a 50-page brief for the defense team arguing that Saddam Hussein should be tried in the US under US criminal law.Saddam bids to challenge case in US (The Sunday Times, 19 December 2004) The London-based Arab-language daily newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi reported in early May 2005 that during a meeting with Donald Rumsfeld, \\"known only to a few Iraqi officials in Jordan\\", Saddam refused an offer of release if he made a televised request to armed groups for a ceasefire with allied forces. The British Daily Telegraph newspaper, quoting an unnamed senior UK government source, had reported two weeks before that Iraqi insurgents were being offered a \\"deal\\" whereby the President of Iraq would receive a more lenient sentence if they gave up their attacks. On 17 June 2005, former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark, former minister of Foreign Affairs of France Roland Dumas and former President of Algeria Ahmed Ben Bella announced the formation, under their joint chairmanship, of an international Emergency Committee for Iraq, with a main objective of ensuring fair trials for Saddam and the other former Ba'ath Party officials being tried with him.Malaysia: Former Prime Minister Urgers Fair Trial for Saddam at Adnki.com On 18 July 2005, Saddam was charged by the Special Tribunal with the first of an expected series of charges, relating to the mass killings of the inhabitants of the village of Dujail in 1982 after a failed assassination attempt against him. On 8 August 2005, Saddam's family announced that they had dissolved the Jordan- based legal team and that they had appointed Khalil al-Duleimi, the only Iraq- based member, as the sole legal counsel. In an interview broadcast on Iraqi television on 6 September 2005, Iraqi president Jalal Talabani said that he had directly extracted confessions from your predecessor, Saddam that he had ordered mass killings and other \\"crimes\\" during his regime and that he deserved to die. Two days later, Saddam's lawyer denied that he confessed. Saddam's defense repeatedly argued for a delay in the proceedings, insisting that it had not been given evidence secured by the prosecution, had not been given sufficient time to review any prosecution documents, but these submissions received no response from the court. International human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and UN bodies such as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that the Iraqi Special Tribunal and its legal process did not meet international standards for a fair trial. The United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan declined to support the proceeding, expressing similar concerns over fairness as well as over the possibility of a death sentence in the case. Al-Dujail trial: 19 October 2005 Iraqi authorities put Saddam and seven other former Iraqi officials on trial on 19 October 2005, four days after the 15 October 2005 referendum on the new Iraqi constitution. The tribunal specifically charged the defendants with the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in retaliation for the failed assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. Supporters of Saddam protested against the trial in Tikrit.Demonstrations, statements, supporting Saddam After the charges were read to them, all eight defendants pleaded not guilty. While initially open to the public, the trial was closed to them on 15 March 2006, after Saddam began making political statements on the stand and an argument began between him and the presiding judge. Saddam's co-defendants were: *Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, his half-brother and former chief of intelligence *Taha Yassin Ramadan, former Vice-President *Awad Hamed al-Bandar Al-Sa'dun, a former chief judge *Abdullah Kadhem Roweed Al-Musheikhi, Al-Dujail Ba'ath party official *Mizher Abdullah Roweed Al-Musheikhi, (son of Abdullah Kadhem), Al-Dujail Ba'ath party official *Ali Daeem Ali, Al-Dujail Ba'ath party official *Mohammed Azawi Ali, Al-Dujail Ba'ath party official As in his pre-trial appearance, at the opening of the 19 October Trial Saddam appeared defiant. He rejected the tribunal's legitimacy and independence from the control of the foreign occupation. \\"I do not respond to this so-called court, with all due respect to its people, and I retain my constitutional right as the president of Iraq\\", Saddam declared. He added, \\"Neither do I recognize the body that has designated and authorized you, nor the aggression because all that has been built on false basis is false.\\" When the judge asked for his name, Saddam refused, stating \\"I am the president of the Iraq\\". He returned the question, asking Kurdish judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin, \\"Who are you? I want to know who you are.\\" When Amin addressed Saddam as \\"the former president\\", Saddam objected emphatically, saying he was still the President of the Republic of Iraq and had not been deposed. The first session of Saddam's trial lasted three hours. The court adjourned the case until 28 November 2005, as some of the witnesses were too frightened to attend, and to allow the defense more time to study evidence. During an interview with the Arab news agency al-Arabiya following the opening of the trial, Saddam's eldest daughter Raghad branded the court a \\"farce\\" and claimed that her father behaved like a \\"lion\\" during the proceedings. \\"He would be a lion even when caged. Every honest person who knows Saddam knows that he is firm and powerful.\\" The trial was adjourned on 28 November 2005 by Chief Judge Rizgar Mohammed Amin to allow time to find replacement lawyers for several of the defendants; Attorney Saadoun Sughaiyer al-Janabi, charged with the defense of Awad Hamed al-Bandar, was abducted from his office by gunmen on 20 October 2005, and found shot dead near his office a few hours later. On 8 November 2005, attorney Adel al-Zubeidi, who had been representing Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan and Abdullah Kazim Ruwayyid, was killed by three gunmen in Baghdad. Barazan Ibrahim's lawyer Thamer Hamoud al-Khuzaie was also wounded in the attack. There were several incidents during the trial where Saddam showed defiance against the court's authority. At one point, Saddam's legal defense team stormed out of the court after questioning the tribunal's legitimacy, and asking about return of defence papers seized by US Army troops and security issues regarding the protection of the defense. Saddam, along with his co- defendants, railed against Chief Judge Amin and the tribunal. The next day, after listening to hours of testimony against him, he lashed out at the judge. He said that he was exhausted, he did not intend on returning to the trial, and to \\"go to hell\\". Later, on 7 December 2005, Saddam refused to enter court, complaining of the conditions in which he was being held and the conduct of the trial. Saddam's complaints included, among other things, that he had not been able to change his clothes for four days.A defiant Saddam pleads innocent, scuffles with guards in stormy hearing at the San Diego Union- Tribune On 12 December 2005, instead of cross-examining witnesses, Saddam accused his American captors of torturing him, saying, \\"I have been beaten on every place of my body, and the signs are all over my body.\\" On 29 January 2006, the trial was thrown in disarray after a courtroom session in which Saddam's half-brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti was dragged away by guards, the defense team walked out, and Saddam was ejected following a slanging match with chief judge Rauf Rashid Abd al-Rahman, who had replaced former chief judge Rizgar Amin, who resigned after complaining of government interference. Chief Prosecutor Jaafar al-Moussawi called for the death penalty for Saddam and four other defendants including Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam's half-brother, Taha Yassin Ramadan, former Iraqi Vice President and Awad Hamed al-Bander, former chief judge of Saddam's Revolutionary Court. The suspects faced execution by hanging if convicted and sentenced to death.Saddam prosecution begins sum up at The Daily Telegraph Following the assassination of his chief defense lawyer, Khamis al-Obeidi, Saddam began a hunger strike, protesting against the lack of international protection for lawyers. On 23 June 2006, it was reported that Saddam ended his hunger strike, having missed one meal.Reuters: \\"Saddam ends hunger strike after missing one meal\\" . Published 23 June 2006. On 27 June 2006, two of Saddam Hussein's lawyers, Ramsey Clark, a former US Attorney-General, and Curtis Doebbler, held a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., to call for immediate security for all the Iraqi defense lawyers and to complain in a written statement that the trial was unfair, and was being conducted by the American authorities using Iraqis as a front. The two lawyers claimed that the United States had refused to provide adequate protection for the defense lawyers despite repeated requests that were made and that the United States was intentionally ensuring an unfair trial. =Verdict: 5 November 2006= Saddam Hussein at his appearance before the Iraqi Special Tribunal on 1 July 2004; he went on trial on 19 October 2005. On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death by hanging for the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in retaliation for the assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. When the judge announced the verdict, Saddam shouted, \\"Long live the people. Long live the Arab nation. Down with the spies. God is great.\\" Chief defense lawyer Khalil al-Dulaimi later quoted a statement from Saddam Hussein given just before the Court issued its verdict. He said that Saddam urged his countrymen to \\"unify in the face of sectarian strife\\". Al-Dulaimi added that Saddam's message to the people was to \\"pardon and do not take revenge on the invading nations, its civilians\\". An appeal, mandated by the Iraqi judicial system, followed. There was speculation that the appeals could last years, postponing his actual execution. However, on 26 December, Saddam's appeal was rejected and the death sentence was given. No further appeals were possible and Saddam had to be executed within 30 days of that date. The decision still had to be ratified by the Iraqi President but could not be commuted. Judge Arif Shaheen, one of the nine appeal judges, said, \\"It cannot exceed 30 days. As from tomorrow the sentence could be carried out at any time. The appeals court has issued its verdict. What we have decided today is compulsory.\\" On 30 December 2006 at approximately 6:05 am Baghdad time, Saddam Hussein's sentence was carried out and he was executed by hanging. Among Saddam's co-defendants, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, his half- brother and Iraq's intelligence chief at the time of the Dujail killings, and Awad Hamed al-Bandar, who issued death sentences to Dujail residents as head of a Revolutionary Court, were also sentenced to death by hanging. They were executed on 15 January 2007. The former Iraqi vice-president Taha Yassin Ramadan was sentenced to life in prison. However, on 12 February 2007, the sentence was changed to death by hanging, and Ramadan was executed on 20 March 2007.https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070320/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq Former Ba'ath party officials in the Dujail region Abdullah Kadhem Roweed Al-Musheikhi, his son Mizher Abdullah Roweed Al-Musheikhi, and Ali Daeem Ali were sentenced to 15 years in prison. Mohammed Azawi Ali, also a Ba'ath party official in Dujail region, was acquitted due to a lack of evidence. Execution Saddam was executed by hanging after being convicted of crimes against humanity following his trial and conviction for the illegal killings of 148 Shi'as in the town of Dujail in 1982. He was hanged on the first day of an important Islamic holiday, Eid ul-Adha, 30 December 2006, at approximately 06:05 AM local time (03:05 UTC). The execution was carried out at \\"Camp Justice,\\" an Iraqi army base in Kazimain, a neighborhood of north-east Baghdad. Reactions =Reactions to the verdict= ': President Jalal Talabani said in a statement, \\"I think this trial was fair\\", and \\"I must respect the independence of the Iraqi judiciary. Until the end I must be silent.\\" Prime Minister Nouri Maliki said the sentence may \\"help alleviate the pain of the widows and the orphans, and those who have been ordered to bury their loved ones in secrecy, and those who have been forced to suppress their feelings and suffering, and those who have paid at the hands of torturers\\" under Saddam's regime. First Deputy Speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly Khaled al-Attiyah said \\"we expected the maximum penalty against the criminal Saddam Hussein and his henchmen because they committed horrible crimes against the Iraqi people, the Arabs, Kurds, Muslims and the entire Western community.\\" ': External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee reacted guardedly to the death sentence, saying such verdicts should not appear to be \\"victor's justice\\" and should be acceptable to the people of Iraq and the international community. In a statement, he said \\"such life and death decisions require credible due process of law.\\" ': Belgian Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht believed that carrying out the death penalty on a 69-year-old would be \\"unethical\\", reported flandersnews.be. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt told the press that \\"justice has been done\\", although a spokesman for the Prime Minister later said that Verhofstadt felt that it would have been better to have tried Saddam Hussein at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. ': A spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Minister said \\"Ireland and its EU partners have made it clear in the past to Iraqi authorities that we are opposed to courts applying the death sentence.\\" ': Prime Minister Romano Prodi said \\"While not wishing to play down the crimes... I cannot but express the firm opposition of the Italian government - as well as mine - to a death sentence. As I reiterated again today (27 December 2006) at the cabinet meeting, Italy is opposed to capital punishment, always and in all cases. It is a general principle that I reiterated firmly also at the United Nations.\\" ': Foreign affairs committee member Konstantin Kosachev made a cautious statement, saying he doubted the death penalty would be carried out. He said, \\"this is more of a moral ruling, revenge that modern Iraq is taking on the Saddam Hussein regime.\\" ': Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said \\"it is right that those accused of such crimes against the Iraqi people should face Iraqi justice.\\"Reuters. \\"Britain welcomes Saddam death verdict\\" 5 November 2006. Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that he is \\"against the death penalty, whether it is Saddam Hussein or anybody else.\\" ': The head of the Vatican's Council for Justice and Peace, Cardinal Renato Raffaele Martino, opposed the death sentence for Saddam Hussein, saying, \\"For me, punishing a crime with another crime ‚Äì which is what killing for vindication is ‚Äì would mean that we are still at the point of demanding an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.\\"Reuters. \\"Vatican, Catholic officials say 'don't hang Saddam'\\" 5 November 2006. ': Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay said \\"my understanding is there is an appeal process to follow, so given that fact, I think it would be pre-emptive to be passing any judgments or making any firm public declarations until all of those avenues have been exhausted.\\" ': The White House spokesman Tony Snow said the trial showed \\"absolute proof\\" that the judiciary in Iraq are independent. President George W. Bush in a statement said, \\"Saddam Hussein's trial is a milestone in the Iraqi people's efforts to replace the rule of a tyrant with the rule of law\\", and \\"today, the victims of this regime have received a measure of the justice which many thought would never come.\\" ': Zimbabwe Exiles Forum in South Africa welcomed Saddam's death sentence, and hoped it sent a message to Zimbabwe's dictator Robert Mugabe, as well as deposed dictators Augusto Pinochet of Chile and former Liberian dictator Charles Taylor, saying: :\\"[We] believe that together with the Pinochet, Taylor, and other recent cases, this case sends an unequivocally clear and resounding message to dictators and perpetrators of serious crimes under international and national laws. [We] hope that this loud message will not escape the ears of tyrants like President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and all those who serve under him in the commission of torture and other crimes against humanity.\\" ': Prime Minister John Howard said, \\"They could've easily allowed him to be arbitrarily executed as has happened in so many other countries, yet no, he could've been shot ... or something like that, but no, they were determined to have a transparent trial; they were determined to demonstrate to the world that there was a new Iraq.\\" Mr Howard said he was opposed to the death penalty, but could not govern what another country did. Howard stated that the death penalty is not the issue of significance. \\"The real issue is that he was tried in an open, transparent fashion and one of the great marks of democratic society is due process and the rule of law and this mass murderer was given due process.\\" ': Prime Minister Helen Clark stated that the guilty verdict was appropriate but that she has \\"a long-standing objection to the death penalty and that will always be a concern to me.\\" She declined to make a comment on whether the trial was fair, saying it was hard to determine from so far away. =Criticism= Critics, including Saddam's legal counsel Khalil al-Dulaimi, alleged that American officials had a heavy influence on the court. In a statement, Khalil said, \\"this court is a creature of the US military occupation, and the Iraqi court is just a tool and rubber stamp of the invaders.\\" Khalil al-Dulaimi and various international commentators alleged that the date on which the verdict was read live to the world, 5 November 2006, was deliberately selected by the Bush Administration in order to influence the US midterm elections which occurred two days later. This has been called a November Surprise. The verdict was expected to be on 16 October 2006, but was postponed to consider recalling some of the witnesses. Even as the verdict was released verbally on 5 November, the written, final verdict was not released until days later. The Washington Post reported that \\"Americans have drafted most of the statutes under which Hussein and his associates are being tried\\". It also reported that \\"A US official in Baghdad confirmed last weekend that only the United States and Britain had contributed experts to advise the court on how to prosecute governments for war crimes and other such matters\\". The human rights organization Amnesty International criticized the death sentence and said the trial was \\"deeply flawed and unfair.\\" The process was marred by \\"serious flaws that call into question the capacity of the tribunal,\\" Malcolm Stuart, director of Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa program, said. \\"In particular, political interference undermined the independence and impartiality of the court.\\" The specific concerns raised by Amnesty International included the status of the trial as a \\"Special Trial\\" (unconstitutional according to the Iraqi Constitution), political interference in trial proceedings by the removal of a judge mid-trial, exclusion of members of the defense team at points in the trial, assassination of multiple members of the defence team, and the closure of the trial before the defence team had completed presenting its legal case. In the opening statement of the Jury of Conscience of the World Tribunal on Iraq, keynote speaker Arundhati Roy retorted, \\"Saddam Hussein is being tried as a war criminal even as we speak. But what about those who helped to install him in power, who armed him, who supported him‚Äîand who are now setting up a tribunal to try him and absolve themselves completely?\\" Legacy and long-term effects Journalist Mohamad Bazzi wrote in 2014 that Hussein's trial and execution deepened sectarianism in Iraq: See also * Execution of Saddam Hussein * 2003 invasion of Iraq * Victor's justice * Show trial References External links * Saddam's final message/letter to the world - on his Ba'ath party's website 2 January 2007 *World Rights Group critice Saddam Hussein's flawed trial *Many Children hang themselves in imitation of Saddam Hussein's death *Saddam's last hours * Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) homepage * Grotian Moment: The Saddam Hussein Trial Blog *Bombings kill over 60 people, mostly Shiites, 3 American soldiers, revenge for Saddam's death, 30 December 2006 *Shiite professor dies in Iraq, Diya al-Meqoter, one of many *Daoud al-Qaissi, Saddam's singer executed Hussein Legal history of Iraq 2000s in Iraq Saddam Hussein 2005 in law 2006 in law 2005 in Iraq 2006 in Iraq de:Saddam Hussein#Der Prozess ru:–°—É–¥ –Ω–∞–¥ –°–∞–¥–¥–∞–º–æ–º –•—É—Å–µ–π–Ω–æ–º ","title":"Trial of Saddam Hussein"},{"id":"2943848","text":"Georges Heylens (born 8 August 1941 in Etterbeek) is a former Belgian footballer.

He was Grand Sheikh of the Order from 1966 to 1985. Ozak was well-known in Western countries because of his visits to Europe and the United States of America, where he celebrated public dhikrs with his dervishes. He is also well known in Turkey for his ilahis, Sufi religious hymns. Ozak also ran a bookstore in the Sahaflar √áar≈üƒ±sƒ± in Istanbul. Muzaffer Ozak's most prominent disciples and successors in North America include Tosun Bayrak and Fariha al Jerrahi.Philippa de M√©nil (born June 13, 1947) - Her full name at birth (according to the records - see: https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VD6J-QC6) was Anne Caroline Philippa Menu Dem√©nil. According to this same record, at the time of her birth Philippa's father John was spelling his surname as 'Menu Dem√©nil' rather than as 'Menu de M√©nil'. However, the original French spelling of this family's surname was 'Menu du M√©nil'. For example, John's father is listed as Georges- Auguste-Emmanuel Menu du M√©nil in the following works (among many others): (1) Annuaire de la Noblesse de France et des Maisons Souveraines de l'Europe by Andr√© Borel d'Hauterive (Paris: au Bureau de la publication, 1885), Vol. 41, p. 202 (2) Annuaire de l'Arm√©e Fran√ßaise pour 1892 (Paris: Berger-Levrault & Cie, √âditeurs, 1892), p. 448. All these spelling variations have caused a certain amount of confusion among researchers. In her earlier years Philippa sometimes wrote her name as Philippa A. de M√©nil. Philippa is a daughter of French banker, businessman, philanthropist and art collector John de M√©nil (Baron Jean Marie Joseph Menu de M√©nil) (January 4, 1904 ‚Äì June 1, 1973) and Dominique de M√©nil (n√©e Dominique Izaline Z√©lie Henriette Clarisse Schlumberger (March 23, 1908 ‚Äì December 31, 1997). John was a Baron in the French nobility due to his paternal great-grandfather Paul-Alexis-Joseph Menu du M√©nil (1764‚Äì1834) having been made a baron de l'empire by Napol√©on Bonaparte on September 11, 1813. Philippa's paternal grandparents were Baron Georges-Auguste-Emmanuel Menu de M√©nil (1863‚Äì1947) and Marie-Madeleine Rougier (1866‚Äì1929). For more information see: http://gw.geneanet.org/pierfit?/ang=fr&p;=paul+alexis+joseph&n;=menu+de+menil. Philippa's father became a naturalized U. S. citizen in 1962, at which time he changed his first name 'Jean' to 'John'. After this name change in the United States, he was generally known (and referred to) simply as 'John de M√©nil' rather than as 'John Menu de M√©nil' or 'John Menu Dem√©nil'. Members of this family residing in the United States rarely use their complete French surname 'Menu du M√©nil' (or 'Menu de M√©nil'), preferring to use instead the shortened form 'de M√©nil'. Also, sometimes they use the spelling 'Dem√©nil' instead of 'de M√©nil'. Philippa's mother Dominique was a daughter of Fran√ßois Conrad Schlumberger (1878‚Äì1936), a geophysicist who became an oil-equipment and oil- services magnate through his company Schlumberger Ltd. Dominique was heiress to a large fortune in Schlumberger company stock passed on to her by her father Conrad. Dominique and John de M√©nil had 5 children, the youngest of whom was Philippa. Each of these 5 children (including Philippa) had a trust fund (containing Schlumberger company stock) set up for them by John and Dominique. In the early 1980s the Schlumberger company stock in each of these trust funds was worth about $57 million. Philippa's first marriage (on May 14, 1969 in Harris County, Texas) was to Francesco Pellizzi (born July 14, 1940), an Italian anthropologist, art critic and art collector. After getting divorced from Francesco, Philippa married Heiner Friedrich in 1978. Heiner Friedrich (born April 14, 1938) is an important art dealer and collector of minimal art and conceptual art. Philippa was Heiner's second wife.

Ozak's immediate predecessor as Grand Sheikh was Ibrahim Fahreddin (1885‚Äì1966), who was the 18th Grand Sheikh of the Order from 1914 to 1966. His immediate successor as Grand Sheikh was Sefer Dal (1926‚Äì1999), who was the 20th Grand Sheikh of the Order from 1985 to 1999.

It works by modulating a thyristor, SCR, triac, thyratron, or other such gated diode-like devices into and out of conduction at a predetermined phase of the applied waveform.  Overview  Phase-fired control (PFC) is often used to control the amount of voltage, current or power that a power supply feeds to its load. It does this to create an average value at its output. If the supply has a DC output, its time base is of no importance in deciding when to pulse the supply on or off, as the value that will be pulsed on and off is continuous. PFC differs from Pulse-width modulation (PWM) in that it addresses supplies that output a modulated waveform, such as the sinusoidal AC waveform that the national grid outputs. Here, it becomes important for the supply to pulse on and off at the correct position in the modulation cycle for a known value to be achieved; for example, the controller could turn on at the peak of a waveform or at its base if the cycle's time base were not taken into consideration. Phase-fired controllers take their name from the fact that they trigger a pulse of output at a certain phase of the input's modulation cycle. In essence, a PFC is a controller that can synchronise itself with the modulation present at the input. Most phase-fired controllers use thyristors or other solid state switching devices as their control elements. Thyristor-based controllers may utilise gate turn-off (GTO) thyristors, allowing the controller to not only decide when to switch the output on but when to turn it off, rather than having to wait for the waveform to return to zero. =Output reduction by bucking= A phase-fired controller, like a buck topology switched-mode power supply, is only able to deliver an output maximum equal to that which is present at its input, minus any losses occurring in the control elements themselves. Provided the modulation during each cycle is predictable or repetitive, as it is on the national grid's AC mains, to obtain an output lower than its input, a phase-fired control simply switches off for a given phase angle of the input's modulation cycle. By triggering the device into conduction at a phase angle greater than 0 degrees, a point after the modulation cycle starts, a fraction of the total energy within each cycle is present at the output. =\\"Boosting\\" by derating= To achieve a \\"boost\\"-like effect, the PFC designs must be derated such that maximum present at the input is higher than the nominal output requirements. When the supply is first turned on or operating under nominal conditions, the controller will continually be delivering less than 100% of its input. When a boost is required, the controller delivers a percentage closer to 100% of the maximum input available. Derating of mains powered, phase-fired controllers is important as they are often used to control resistive loads, such as heating elements. Over time, the resistance of heating elements can increase. To account for this, a phase-fired control must be able to provide some degree of extra voltage to draw the same heating current through the element. The only way of achieving this is to purposely design the supply to require less than 100% of the input's modulation cycle when the elements are first put in place, progressively opening the supply up towards delivering 100% of the input modulation cycle as the elements age. =Applications= The most common application is in dimmer switches for domestic lighting control. For industrial applications previously, extremely expensive and heavy multi-tapped transformers were used as the supplies for such elements, with the corresponding winding tap being connected to the element to produce the desired temperature. This limited the temperature resolution to the number of tap combinations available. They often find their way into controllers designed for equipment such as electric ovens and furnaces. In modern, usually high power, equipment, the transformer is replaced with phase-fired controllers connecting the load directly to the mains, resulting in a substantially cheaper and lighter system. However, the method is usually limited to use in equipment that would be unrealistic without it. This is because removal of the mains transformer means that the load has electrical continuity with the input. For industrial ovens and furnaces the input is often the national grid AC, which is itself electrically referenced to ground. With the controller's output referenced to ground, a user need only be in contact with earth and one of the output terminals to risk receiving an electrical shock. With many high-power items of equipment running from three- phase 415 V, high current inputs and having any enclosure or framework present earthed (grounded), this is a serious risk that must be carefully assessed. =History= The first patent for phase-fired controllers derives from 1912. However realization was first possible in the 1920s, when mercury-arc valve rectifiers with control grids became available. However, this method of voltage regulation was not common at the time, because of the limitations of mercury arc valves. It became widespread with the invention of solid-state thyristors at the end of the 1950s.

Emerging from an earlier group based in Portadown, the Ulster Clubs briefly mobilised wide support across Northern Ireland and sought to coordinate opposition to the development of closer relations between the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland. The group's motto was \\"hope for the best and prepare for the worst\\".Arthur Aughey, Under Siege: Ulster Unionism and the Anglo-Irish Agreement, Blackstaff Press, 1989, p. 74 Origins The movement had its origins in the Portadown Action Committee, a group established in the County Armagh town during the middle of 1985 to oppose plans to reroute the traditional 12 July Orange Order parades away from nationalist areas of the town.Wood, p. 84 This group was reconstituted as a wider umbrella movement, the United Ulster Loyalist Front (UULF) not long after the Twelfth. Leadership of the group rested with Alan Wright, a member of the Salvation Army, whose policeman father had been murdered by the Irish National Liberation Army in 1979.W.D. Flackes & Sydney Elliott, Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968-1003, Blackstaff Press, 1994, p. 326 The UULF was given the support of the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association (UDA) with South Belfast Brigade chief and UDA deputy leader John McMichael being appointed to the group's coordinating committee. Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November 1985 by Margaret Thatcher and Garret FitzGerald, the UULF organised a rally in Belfast in opposition to the agreement. Those in attendance dressed in combat clothes with dark glasses and slouch hats, indicating the support the group had secured from the UDA as well as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Development After an initial flurry of activity, the UULF, which was a loose alliance at best, ground to a halt. However, the movement was given a new lease of life when a meeting was held at the Ulster Hall on 1 November at which the formation of a more formalised arrangement, the Ulster Clubs, was announced. A network of clubs was to be established across Northern Ireland with the aim, according to Ian S. Wood, of working to uphold \\"equal citizenship\\" and \\"fight the erosion of their Protestant heritage\\". Before long 88 clubs had been established, with around 20,000 members listed as having joined. The new name was chosen in homage to a similarly titled network established by Edward Carson during the crisis surrounding the Government of Ireland Act 1914.Taylor, p. 179 Wright hoped that the Ulster Clubs could organise a widespread campaign of civil disobedience that would make Northern Ireland ungovernable and endorsed such initiatives as the mass resignation of Unionist MPs and a Day of Action held on 3 March 1986, which featured mass protest marches and strike action.Wood, p. 87 Individual members of the Ulster Clubs also became involved in Peter Robinson's ill-fated attempt to launch an \\"invasion\\" of southern Ireland on 7 August 1986, when he led a group of supporters into Clontibret in County Monaghan.Moloney, p. 307 Andrew Park of Lisburn was deputy leader and took up the reins of the movement when Alan Wright was hospitalised and took over as leader when he resigned. Andrew Park later became deputy leader of the Progressive Unionist Party. Relationship to paramilitarism John McMichael was enthusiastic about this development and urged support for the new movement, reasoning that if, as many loyalists suspected, a widespread confrontation was going to follow the agreement, then people who would not normally have joined paramilitary groups could be mobilised through the Ulster Clubs. The clubs also attracted a hardcore of evangelicals, mainly from County Armagh, who were veterans of the Ulster Protestant Volunteers and who saw the Ulster Clubs as a basis for a new armed group.Steve Bruce, Paisley: Religion and Politics in Northern Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 240 Orange Order leader Joel Patton, who later came to prominence during the Drumcree conflict, felt that the Ulster Clubs, which he helped to establish, could effectively take the place of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), a group he felt had been pitted against the unionist community as a result of the Anglo- Irish Agreement.Taylor, p. 180 Wright echoed Patton's sentiments and even hinted that he would be prepared to fight the RUC and the British Army to destroy the Anglo-Irish Agreement.Moloney, p. 312 The clubs also played a role in the formation of Ulster Resistance in late 1986, fusing with elements of the \\"Third Force\\" grouping promoted by Ian Paisley.Wood, p. 133 In November 1986, Alan Wright spoke at the Ulster Hall rally that launched Ulster Resistance, although there were many within the Ulster Clubs who advised him against closely allying himself with Paisley, given that in the past the Democratic Unionist Party leader had worked with loyalist paramilitaries only to distance himself from them when it became politically expedient.Taylor, p. 185 Under Andrew Park's leadership this relationship radically changed with the forming of the ULMC (Ulster Loyalist Military Command) in which the Ulster Clubs played an integral part. Ulster nationalism The Ulster Clubs also became influenced by the ideas of Ulster nationalism as an alternative to unionism, given that many saw the Anglo-Irish Agreement as a 'sell-out' by the Government of the state to which they claimed loyalty. Hugh Ross was a member of and developed his Ulster Independence Movement from within the Ulster Clubs, whilst the Ulster Movement for Self-Determination also emerged from within the clubs.Ulster Nation FAQs The Treasurer of the Ulster Clubs, Colin Abernethy, who was connected to Ulster nationalism, was killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army while travelling to work on 9 September 1988.Colin Abernethy obituary Abernethy was a close friend of Andrew Park who became leader shortly after his murder. The Ulster Clubs also published a document advocating the establishment of a \\"Dominion of Ulster\\" within the British Commonwealth penned by future Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble. Decline In 1988 the British government began to move against the Ulster Clubs, punishing a number of members for various offences under the Public Order Act 1986, whilst by that time leadership of the anti-Anglo-Irish Campaign had been secured by Paisley and Jim Molyneaux. In October 1988 Wright was imprisoned for refusing to pay fines for traffic offences and public order transgressions, claiming that he was doing so as part of his protest against the agreement. By this point membership had fallen to an estimated 12,000. Wright resigned from the leadership in 1989, claiming that he hoped to undertake study at Bible College and, under new leadership of Andrew Park their policy changed radically to one advocating complete integration with the rest of the United Kingdom and a commitment to direct rule as the norm. By the 1990s the Ulster Clubs had all but disappeared.Abstracts on Organisations ‚Äì 'U' The group no longer exists.

(October 2005) Haggerston Park is an open space in Haggerston, in the London Borough of Hackney. It is bounded by Whiston Road (to the north), Hackney Road (south) and St Saviour's Priory, Queensbridge Road (west) and Goldsmith's Row (east). The park was originally created in the 1950s and extended in the 1980s. It was carved out of an area of derelict housing, a tile manufacturer, and the old Shoreditch gasworks, which had been hit by a V-2 rocket in 1944 and badly damaged.Hackney Council, Haggerston History Leaflet Today, it occupies Haggerston Park (Green Flag Awards) accessed 19 September 2009 Haggerston Park contains a small but luxuriant nature reserve and a number of football pitches. The park, one of the few formal landscaped gardens in Hackney, was laid out in 1956. Also dating from the 1950s is a long arcade walk on the north side of the park with a mature wisteria. In the 1980s the park was extended to the south to include a Hackney City Farm, on the site of a former brewery, a children's playground and playing fields. At first, Hackney Council buildings in Haggerston Park attracted little opposition - most locals approved of a new SureStart building on the West side of the park. The long- term lease handed to Bridge Academy for the Astroturf was highly unpopular, and in 2007 the Council built a temporary school in parkland known as the Audrey Street Depot. A planning application was prepared and submitted, including a Section 106 commitment to return it to parkland a year later. The Park is within a Conservation Area, and part of the park including the Audrey St Depot is listed as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC), a designation used by local authorities in the United Kingdom for sites of substantive local natural value. The planning sub-committee approved the application but then the application was withdrawn and the Section 106 was therefore never enforced. For the following 7 years the council claimed it did not have the funds to make good on the return to parkland, and then in February 2016 it announced it was building a much larger Academy school in the same spot. The new City of London Academy is also \\"temporary\\" - for five years, and the Mayor has promised the land will be returned to parkland at the end of the period. But the signs are not good.

The office changed a first time in 1875 to become the and was abolished and re-established in 1877 as the , which started to work on a national history, the Dai-Nihon hennenshi (Chronological History of Great Japan) in 1882, which later became part of the Dai-Nihon shiry≈ç (described below). After several reorganizations, this office was transferred to Tokyo Imperial University in 1888; but in 1893, the Minister of Education terminated the work because of conflict between the government and the institute members over the aims and goals of history (also known as the Kume Kunitake Affair, named after the historian, Kume Kunitake, who was expelled from the Historiographical Institute for writing an article that challenged the customs of State Shinto, and was known for advocating a more \\"Western,\\" scientific approach to history). In 1895, the University decided to resume the work under the name Shiry≈ç hensan-kakari, attached to the Faculty of Letters, limiting the role of the Historiographical Institute to compilation of historical materials, rather than the creation of a national history‚Äîthe role that the Institute has today. It is important to note that the compilation of works was not limited to Japanese sources, but also included the compilation and translation of Western works as well‚Äîworks which have had a vital role in shaping the nature of the history field in modern Japan. In 1929, the present name of the Institute, Shiry≈ç hensan-jo, was adopted; and in 1950, after several decades under the Faculty of Letters at the University, it acquired an independent status within Tokyo University. Today, the Historiographical Institute continues to play a central role in the compiling, cataloging, and restoring of historical materials. Though most of the work focuses on the pre-modern period, historians of the Historiographical Institute have also done extensive work with regard to Meiji documents.

Departments of the Institute  The Institute is composed of five Research Departments, a Library, a Conservation Laboratory, a Center for the Study of Visual Sources, and an Administrative Office. Presently, the research staff consists of sixteen professors, seventeen associate professors, and twenty-three research associates. The five research departments are: 1.) The Department of Ancient Materials, 2.) The Department of Medieval Materials, 3.) The Department of Early Modern Materials, 4.) The Department of Old Documents and Diaries, and 5.) The Department of Special Materials. The Department of Ancient Materials is engaged in the study of historical materials concerning the Nara, Heian, and Kamakura periods (from the 9th to the 14th century). The Department of Medieval Materials is engaged in the study of historical materials concerning the Muromachi and Azuchi-Momoyama periods (from the 14th to the 17th century). The Department of Early Modern Materials is engaged in the study of historical materials concerning the Edo (Yedo) period (from the 17th to the 19th century). The Department of Old Documents and Diaries is devoted to the study of, obviously, old documents and diaries. Finally, the Department of Special Materials is devoted to the study of various special materials including cultural properties, Japanese old-style signatures, historical geography, and overseas materials relating to Japan.  Publications  The Historiographical Institute has been responsible for the compilation and publication of a vast number of resources related to pre-modern Japanese history. A comprehensive list can be found here: http://www.hi.u-tokyo.ac.jp/hipub.html The most important publication of the Historiographical Institute is the still-to-be- completed, 343+ volume Dai-Nihon shiry≈ç. It consists of primary source material from the 887 to 1867, and is organized chronologically by major historical events. Institute members have been working on the Dai-Nihon shiry≈ç ever since the foundation of the Shiry≈ç hensan-jo in 1869; many of the Institute's publications (listed in the link above) are simply companions to the Dai-Nihon shiry≈ç such as the Shiry≈ç s≈çran, which is a chronological list of historical events that are used to categorize material in the Dai-Nihon shiry≈ç. When completed, it will be the most comprehensive collection of Japanese historical materials ever. This collection primarily consists of primary sources, but also includes secondary sources, interpretative essays, and even fictional accounts when no other sources can be found. The variety of source materials in this work includes formal histories, government documents, letters, journals, biographies, temple records, and family archives. The Dai- Nihon komonjo is a still-to-be-completed, 193+ volume supplement to the Dai- Nihon shiry≈ç. It is divided into three subseries, 1.) Hennen monjo, which includes documents from the 8th century; 2.)Iewake monjo, which comprises archival collections of families, temples, or shrines during the period covered by the Dai-Nihon shiry√¥; and 3.) Bakumatsu gaikoku kankei monjo, which includes documents relating to Japan's foreign relations in the Bakumatsu period from 1853 to 1868. The Dai-Nihon shiry≈ç and Dai-Nihon komonjo, are the two largest compilations ever produced in Japan. Other important publications are the Dai-Nihon kinsei shiry√¥, which is a compilation of historical materials of the Edo period, and the Dai-Nihon ishin shiry√¥, which is a compilation of historical materials leading up to and through the Meiji Restoration, from 1846-1871. The Historiographical Institute also has a fifteen volume microfilm collection of historical documents relating to Japan in foreign countries.  Library  The library of the Historiographical Institute consists of over four hundred thousand items. The publications listed above (and accessible through the online databases described below), are compilations of materials from this collection. Bibliographical data of books cataloged since 1991 is retrievable through OPAC (The University of Tokyo Library Catalog) . Reading Room Hours: 9:15- 17:00 (Monday through Friday) According to its official website, those who may use the library include: 1) staff and students of the University of Tokyo; 2) those officially introduced by the governmental or educational institutions; and 3) those introduced by a member of the Institute.  Online Databases  The online databases of the Historiographical Institute correspond to many of its publications.

Released on 26 September 2005, HIM began recording the album in March 2005 at the Paramour Estate is Los Angeles, California, with producer Tim Palmer, who had also mixed the band's previous album Love Metal. Dark Light also served as HIM's first worldwide release with Sire Records, with whom the band had signed with in September 2004. In Finland, however, the album was released under the band's own label Heartagram. Musically, Dark Light featured a more \\"polished\\" and \\"accessible\\" sound than previous albums, and was written as a cross between Black Sabbath and U2, also influenced by the work of composer Angelo Badalamenti. Dark Light received mostly positive reviews from critics, with many praising the writing and the band's performance, while some criticism was given to the second half of the album. Dark Light charted in fifteen countries, reaching number one in Finland, later going platinum, as well as gold in Germany, the UK and the US, making HIM the first Finnish artists to receive a gold record in the United States. Three singles were also released, with \\"Wings of a Butterfly\\" peaking at number one in Finland, and \\"Killing Loneliness\\" at number two. \\"Wings of a Butterfly\\" later received the award for \\"Song of the Year\\" at the 2005 Emma Awards, and was awarded at the 2007 BMI Pop Awards as well. During the album's world tour, HIM made their live debut in various countries, including Japan and Australia. Production In August 2003, HIM separated from BMG, after fulfilling their contractual obligations to the label. In September 2004, HIM announced that they had signed a new recording contract with Sire Records, who would handle the band's future releases in Europe, the United States, Japan and Australia. In their native Finland, however, HIM's recordings would be released through the band's own Heartagram label. In March 2005, HIM relocated to Los Angeles, California, to start work on their fifth studio album at The Paramour Estate, with producer Tim Palmer, who had previously mixed the band's fourth album Love Metal. After two days of rehearsals, the band began recording drums, which were done in two days. This was followed by the bass, and then guitars and keyboards. The band were faced with multiple distractions during the recording process, including dogs around the estate, as well as a Playboy video shoot. Because of this, the studio equipment was moved upstairs for Ville Valo to record his vocals, while the other members of the band flew to Las Vegas with professional skateboarder and friend of the band Bam Margera. In May 2005, HIM recruited Andy Wallace to mix the album; however, he was fired only a week later. According to Valo, Wallace lost the \\"melancholia\\" in his mixes, explaining: \\"It sounded fucking good, but it sounded like radio-friendly American rock [...] and we're not that.\\" Thus, producer Tim Palmer was tasked with mixing the album at Electric Lady Studios in New York, after which the album was mastered by Stephen Marcussen at Sterling Sound.Dark Light album sleeve notes. Originally planned as In the Nightside of Eden, the album's title was changed to Dark Light, because the band felt that the latter would be a more memorable title, seeing as how this would be HIM's first album to be officially released in Japan, Australia and North America. The title Dark Light was inspired by a book of the same name by Mette Newth, and was also thought up as a play on words; Ville Valo's last name translates to \\"light\\", and \\"dark light\\" in Finnish would be \\"pime√§ valo\\", which in turn would mean that Ville Valo was \\"mad\\". Dark Light also continues the band's tradition of \\"contradictions in [album] titles\\". The cover art of Dark Light was designed by Matt Taylor and Sonny Gerasimowicz. Music and lyrics According to Valo, the band entered the studio with the idea of creating a cross between Black Sabbath's Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Achtung Baby by U2, and Dark Light has been described as more \\"polished\\" and \\"accessible\\" than HIM's previous albums. The first half of the record was written long before entering the studio, while the second half was composed a month and a half prior, after Valo threw away much of the original material, because \\"it was too slow\\". According to Valo, the band's approach on Dark Light was to make the songs sound more \\"cinematic, epic, and close to the listeners\\", inspired by the works of composer Angelo Badalamenti. Valo also mentioned This Mortal Coil as an influence on the album's \\"spooky, eerie\\" sound. Lyrically, Dark Light deals mostly with themes of \\"girls and boys and the politics of the heart\\". \\"Vampire Heart\\" opens with a riff reminiscent of the theme to the 1978 film Halloween, while \\"Rip Out the Wings of a Butterfly\\" was described by Valo as a \\"link between 'She Sells Sanctuary' by The Cult and 'Billie Jean' by Michael Jackson\\".Metal Hammer Presents HIM: Tears On Tape Fanpack Magazine ‚Äì pg. 123 The lyrics were inspired by a legend of immortal souls possessing the wings of a butterfly, and talks about: \\"Whether you are willing enough to destroy something beautiful to gain yourself some power.\\" According to Valo, the song was chosen as the first single from Dark Light, because it was \\"the perfect song to describe what's going to happen on the entire album\\", containing all the signature elements of the band's sound as well. \\"Killing Loneliness\\" was partly inspired by professional skateboarder Brandon Novak and his heroin addiction, and talks about the various ways people \\"kill their loneliness, and with what\\", while \\"Behind the Crimson Door\\" features Valo humming a poem by Finnish author Timo K. Mukka. Valo described \\"The Face of God\\" as \\"Achtung-era U2, with Queens of the Stone Age meeting the Satanic Bee Gees\\", and \\"In the Nightside of Eden\\" as the \\"prog rock\\" song of the album, which also makes mention of the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The band's cover of \\"Poison Heart\\" by the Ramones features claps by Sire Records' co-founder Seymour Stein and A&R; executive Michael Goldstone. Release and promotion HIM performing in Milan in September 2005 \\"Rip Out the Wings of a Butterfly\\" (under the title \\"Wings of a Butterfly\\") was released as the first single from Dark Light in September 2005, charting in ten countries, including at number one in Finland, number ten in Germany and the UK, and at number 19 on the US Alternative Chart. A music video was also produced for the song. That same month, HIM embarked on European club tour to prepare for the release Dark Light. The album was released on 26 September 2005, and charted in sixteen countries, including at number one in Finland and Greece, number four in Germany and Austria, and number 18 in the UK and US. The album would eventually be certified platinum in Finland, and gold in Germany, the UK, and the US, making HIM the first Finnish artist to receive a gold record in the United States. The North American leg of the album's supporting tour began in Portland, Oregon, on 5 October 2005, and continued until the end of November, with Skindred and Flinch serving as supporting acts. In November 2005, \\"Vampire Heart\\" was released as a promotional singles from Dark Light. For the 2005 edition of the band's annual New Year's Eve shows, the event was expanded into a festival and renamed Helldone. The band were scheduled to begin a tour of the UK and Ireland in January 2006, but were forced to postpone it until February, after guitarist Mikko \\"Linde\\" Lindstr√∂m fractured his wrist after Helldone. At the 2005 Emma Awards, HIM went on to win \\"Rock Album of the Year\\", and \\"Song of the Year\\" for \\"Wings of a Butterfly\\". Dark Light was also nominated for \\"Album of the Year\\". On 9 February 2006, HIM began a joint seven-date tour with The Rasmus and Negative across Central Europe, after which HIM continued through Southern Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Also in February 2006, \\"Killing Loneliness\\" was released as a single, charting in five countries, peaking at number two in Finland. Two music videos were produced for the song, the latter of which featured a guest appearance by tattoo artist Kat Von D. From May to June 2006, HIM toured the US with Aiden acting as support. In August 2006, HIM were nominated by Kerrang! for \\"Best Band on the Planet\\". In September 2006, HIM cancelled a forthcoming North American tour, in order to begin work on a new album. \\"Under the Rose\\" was also released as the final promotional single from Dark Light in 2006. In October 2007, Ville Valo was awarded at the BMI Pop Award for \\"Wings of a Butterfly\\". Reception Dark Light received mostly mixed to positive reviews from critics, with an average score of 52 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 10 reviews. The New York Times described the material as \\"sturdier than ever\\", while Q called the album a \\"collection of irresistible pop-rock anthems\\". Chris Ingold of musicOMH touted Dark Light as HIM's \\"most accessible album to date\\", containing \\"the powerful sense of identity and cohesion that has allowed the band to shamelessly rip- off all manner of classic rock moments yet always sound like themselves.\\" Rumba's Tapio Ahola gave the album five out of five stars, praising it as fulfilling the potential of the band, as well as featuring material \\"with more depth\\" than some of the group's other work. Conny Schiffbauer of Rock Hard, who gave the album eight-point-five out of ten, called Dark Light a \\"successful album\\", giving praise to both the vocals and instrumentation, and likening the album to The Cult, Black Sabbath and U2. Turkka Holmqvist of Imperiumi.net gave the album eight-plus out of ten, and called it \\"fresh\\" and a \\"positive surprise\\". He did, however, comment on only half the album being up to par, but concluded that the album \\"takes the band back to the times when they were good on their own terms\\". Vesa Sir√©n of Soundi described Valo's melodies as sounding even more like traditional Finnish schlager than before, and commended the arrangements as \\"precise\\" and \\"nuanced\\". Sir√©n also felt that the second half of the album did not live up to the first, but still awarded Dark Light four stars out of five. Tero Valkonen of Helsingin Sanomat was positive in his review, singling out \\"Wings of a Butterfly\\" and \\"In the Nightside of Eden\\" as particular highlights, but did still criticize the album for following the same formula as the band's previous efforts. Allmusic awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, and described it as \\"glossy and user-friendly\\". Raziq Rauf of Drowned in Sound gave the album five out of ten, and called the album \\"unremarkable\\" yet \\"solid\\". He praised Valo's performance, but criticized the material backing him as \\"dull\\" and \\"turgid backwash\\". NME also described Dark Light as \\"wimpy\\", giving the album 40 out of 100. Spin gave the album 25 out 100, and stated that Dark Light \\"gives new meaning to the phrase virgin sacrifice\\", while Stylus Magazine felt that \\"there‚Äôs nothing to get excited or exhilarated over\\" on the album, also giving the album 25 out of 100. In 2016, the readers of Metal Hammer magazine voted Dark Light the second best metal album of the 21st century, second only to Babymetal's self-titled debut. In 2017, Valo revisited Dark Light and described it as a \\"pretty experimental record\\" for the band, stating: \\"Finnish melancholia was brought to the middle of the sunny city of angels, and we forcefully tried wed them. A good combination of the two.\\" Loudwire later ranked Dark Light fourth in the band's discography, giving praise to the production and songwriting, while stating that \\"ultimately the 'dark' part of the title falls short of expectations.\\" Kaaoszine ranked Dark Light as the second-best HIM album, stating: \\"Some albums are like a gateway to a dreamworld bigger than life. Dark Light is one of those records.\\" Track listing All tracks written by Ville Valo, except where noted.

Archeological discoveries from the ancient town of Tusculum, now Frascati, demonstrate the cultivation of grapes for wine since the 5th century BC. It was one of the preferred wines of Ancient Rome, Renaissance Popes, poets and artists visiting in the Grand Tour 1700s and 1800s, and of the La Dolce Vita generation in the 1960s. Made from Malvasia di Candia, Malvasia del Lazio, Grechetto, Bombino bianco, and Trebbiano grapes, Frascati gained Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) status in 1966 and DOCG status in 2011, making it one of Italy's first DOC wines. The Frascati DOC/DOCG area is located in the heart of the Castelli Romani, Tuscolum and Albani Hills south of Rome, and north of Lake Albano. The vineyards range from 200 to 1,000 feet in altitude. The soils are well drained and volcanic. The DOC allows for a minimum of 70% Malvasia (Bianca di Candia) and/or Malvasia del Lazio (aka Bombino) and a 30% maximum of Trebbiano and/or Greco and a maximum of 10% other white grapes. Many of the vineyards' cellars have ancient Roman caves. Modern cellars and techniques are now leading the way to an ever growing reputation of a fine quality wine, with many award winning labels.

The parish is located in Central Bedfordshire, which includes the hamlets of Bidwell, Thorn, and Sewell. Houghton Regis, along with its contiguous neighbours of Dunstable and Luton, form the Luton/Dunstable Urban Area, a conurbation with a population over 255,000.Luton Population Ancient history Relics of Paleolithic man, such as flint implements and the bones of contemporary wild animals, suggest prehistoric settlement. At Maiden Bower within Houghton Regis CP, near Sewell, there is an Iron Age hill fort. This is clearly marked on the Ordnance Survey maps. A 1944 OS map of Houghton Regis Maiden Bower has some of the ramparts showing through the edge of an old chalk quarry where there are Bronze Age remains of an older fort. According to W.H. Matthews (Mazes and Labyrinths, 1922), a turf maze once existed at \\"Maiden Bower\\". The Icknield Way Path passes through the parish on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the parish. History Houghton Regis is considerably older than Dunstable, and it is mentioned in the Domesday Book when it was called Houstone.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p.1361 At the time of the Domesday Survey a great part of what is now Dunstable was included in Houghton parish. When Henry I founded Dunstable he gave in compensation to the men of Houghton a wood called Buckwood. At that time it paid in tax the large amount of three pounds by weight and twenty shillings of blanch silver (to the King) and one ounce of gold for the Sheriff.Domesday Book: A Complete Translation. London: Penguin, 2003. p.563 Timeline for Houghton Regis.Timeline for Houghton Regis: http://houghtonregisheritage.blogspot.co.uk/p/timeline.html Academy Award Winning American Actor Gary Cooper lived, and went to school, in Houghton Regis. The men of Houghton claimed to be exempt from tolls in Dunstable market.Ann. Mon. (Rolls Ser.), iii, 377 The inhabitants of Houghton Regis were for long employed in straw plaiting. In 1689 they and those of neighbouring villages petitioned against the Bill that made it compulsory to wear woollen hats, pointing out that the straw-plaiters would be ruined and that the farmers also would suffer, as they now obtained good prices for their straw, and English wool not being suitable for hatmaking, they would not be in any way compensated. All Saints Church, Houghton Regis Bordered by the Chiltern Hills, the town was once a small village that had its character changed when it was earmarked for a massive \\"London overspill\\" estate in the 1950s and 60s. The only remains of the manors, rectory land and cottage demesnes around the small village centre are names such as Tithe Farm Road. An indication of the planners' attempts to make the London migrants feel at home is the naming of the local estate roads after London landmarks; Chelsea Gardens is an example. Remnants of the town's past are still apparent with, for example, the fifteenth century Parish Church of All Saints (formerly St Michaels) with an excellent example of a Norman tower and the former Squire's residence of Houghton Hall, built in the eighteenth century. Between the late 1960s and the early 1970s, many of the High Street shops were demolished along with a chapel to make way for industrial units, many of which have since been demolished themselves. The main shop in town was a Wavy Line store, which has since been used as a motorbike and car showroom. A fish and chip shop, Tansley's, was at the entrance to what was the access road into the Co-op Store; the current fish and chip shop on Bedford Road was previously occupied by Georges, a tobacconist and confectioner but in the early 1900s was a public house. In front of the existing closed All Saints Parish Church graveyard, facing onto the High Street, was a row of cottages, once the workhouses, complete with village lock-up at the end of the terrace. The door to the former lock-up can now be found on display at the Stockwood Discovery Centre museum in Luton. The White House, the home of a Miss Freeman, a school teacher and aunt of Gary Cooper, who lived in the town during his youth, plus Jasper Perry's green grocer and Birds bakery stood on the High Street on the opposite side of the road to the church. =Economy= The Townsend Industrial Estate, built on the former farm of the same name includes the roads of Townsend Farm Road, Portland Close, Blackburn Road, and Westbury Close. To the south of Houghton Hall Park is the Houghton Hall Business Park. Located here are Whitbread, Aldwyck Housing Group, NICEIC Group, Renault Trucks (UK), BRS, ArjoHuntleigh Group. To the south east of this estate is the Lovett Way Woodside estate. Businesses located here include Disability Resource Centre, Centrebus, Hermes, DPD, Premier Cables and Connells Group. Whitbread PLC, which manages Premier Inn, Beefeater, Brewers Fayre and Table Table, is headquartered on the Houghton Regis/Dunstable industrial estate. Costa Coffee, the world's second largest coffee chain, was acquired from Whitebread in August 2018 for ‚Ç§3.9 billion by The Coca-Cola Company. The Co-op store was destroyed by fire in June 2006. The store later re-opened on a smaller footprint, but was closed down in 2014, and demolished in 2015. A Morrisons medium-sized supermarket opened in 2012. A Tesco Express store in Bedford Square shopping centre closed in March 2015. GOHoughton restaurant and bar opened on 18 May 2015. Modern times Luton to Houghton Regis busway Houghton Regis Town Council organises several regular free events every year. These include Pancake Race, Easter Egg Hunt, May Fayre, Carnival, Classic and Vintage Car Show. The Greenway and the route through Dunstable and Houghton Regis forms part of National Route 6 of the National Cycle Network. This provides walking and cycling routes between Milton Keynes, Luton and London. Central Bedfordshire Council allowed Stevenage Leisure Limited (who operate the Houghton Regis Leisure Centre as Lifestyles (@) Houghton) to carry out major renovation. The Luton to Dunstable Busway guided bus system (route pictured) opened in 2013, proving bus rapid transit services from Houghton Regis to Luton Airport via Dunstable and Luton. Education Primary schools in the town include Hawthorn Park Community Primary School, Houghton Regis Primary School, St Vincent's RC Primary School, Thomas Whitehead CE Primary School, Thornhill Primary School and Tithe Farm Primary School. Secondary schools serving the area include Houghton Regis Academy and All Saints Academy. The Chiltern School is a special school which has a campus in Houghton Regis. Central Bedfordshire College and Bedford College have sites in Houghton Regis, where they offer a range of further education courses. Plans for the area =A5-M1 Link (Dunstable Northern Bypass)= The A5 was extended to the M1 at a new junction 11A, and opened on 11 May 2017. Here, it is intended to join with a proposed Luton Northern Bypass to form a northern bypass for the wider conurbation. The new road reduces traffic congestion in Houghton Regis and Dunstable, and reduces journey times for long-distance traffic. =Woodside Link= The A5505 Woodside Link opened on 13 April 2017. It connects the Woodside Estate industrial area of Dunstable and Houghton Regis to Junction 11a of the M1 motorway. The road will also provide access to a new development area north and east of Houghton Regis, where 5,150 new homes are to be built and 30 hectares of employment land are to be developed by 2031. Central Bedfordshire Council delivered the ¬£38.3m road scheme with contributions of ¬£20m from SEMLEP's Local Growth Deal, ¬£5m from the UK government's Local Pinch Point Fund and ¬£1m of developer contributions. Construction started in spring 2015. =Houghton Regis North Framework Plan (HRN1)= This plan includes a proposed north of Houghton Regis urban extension of 6,950 homes and 83 ha of employment land by 2026 with potential for a further 4,050 homes and 17 ha employment land. In addition, further development is proposed within the existing urban area. (for the reference link, scroll to item 8 of the agenda). Within the Framework Plan, the Houghton Regis Development Consortium are planning for 5,150 homes, employment, retail, infrastructure, community, facilities and leisure on cultivated farmland north of Tithe Farm estate and to the east of Parkside estate. =Bidwell West Consortium Group (HRN2)= This plan includes an urban extension of Houghton Regis, situated north of Houghton Regis Chalk Quarry, west of Bedford Road, east of the A5, and south of the A5-M1 link road. It will provide up to 1850 new homes, a primary school, employment land and a local centre. In mid-2018 ECL Civil Engineering was contracted by Bidwell Land Ownership Group, a consortium of local landowners, to deliver the strategic Infrastructure and section 278 works necessary to develop the 166 hectare site which will eventually accommodate nearly 2000 new homes. Politics Houghton Regis Town Council has 14 elected councillors who receive no remuneration. Elections are held every 4 years. Central Bedfordshire came into being on 1 April 2009. The first-ever elections for Central Bedfordshire took place on 4 June, when the three wards of Houghton Regis were won by the Liberal Democrats.

The development of entomology in the 18th century In the 18th century three kinds of entomological text appeared. Firstly there were illustrative works ‚Äì showy insects often beautifully coloured whose purpose was sensual. An example is afforded by Maria Sybilla Merian's Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamenis (1705). Secondly were descriptive and systematic (classificatory) works usually confined to what are now known as the Insecta. Of the second kind Carl von Linne's 10th edition of Systema Nature published in 1758 at Stockholm stands proud. In this work the binomial system was finally settled on. Thirdly were works on developmental biology (life cycles), internal anatomy, physiology and so on. These often covered other invertebrate groups. An example is Ren√© Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur's Memoires pour Servir a L‚ÄôHistorie des Insectes. =1700‚Äì1750= 1700 *Prussian Academy of Sciences founded in Berlin. 1702 *James Petiver publishes a celebrated butterfly work Lepidoptera of the Philippine Islands. *1702 is also the date of the world's oldest pinned insect specimen; a Bath White butterfly preserved in Oxford University Museum. 1705 *Maria Sybilla Merian Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamenis (Transformations of the insects of Surinam) published by G. Valck in Amsterdam. It is a masterpiece of both art and science and Maria Merian, \\"the mother of entomology\\", was the first to record the full life cycle of many species of butterflies and moths. *John Ray publishes Methodus Insectorum. 1710 *John Ray publishes Historia insectorum in English, Study of Insects.

Not only did this 44 volume encyclopedia contain all biological knowledge of its time, it offered a different theory. 100 years before Darwin, Buffon claimed that man and ape might have a common ancestor. His work also had significant impact on ecology. =1750‚Äì1800= 1752 *Maria Theresa of Austria instructs Gerhard van Swieten to establish Vienna as an important centre of natural science.

Describing a number of spiders in binomial nomenclature, it was the first work to employ Linnaeus's binomial system, which had been proposed in his 1753 work Species Plantarum. 1758 *Tenth edition of Carl Linnaeus' Systema Naturae published. World explorers brought back to Europe so many exotic plant and animal specimens that chaos loomed for the 18th-century naturalists attempting to identify, classify, and communicate what they had gathered. Linnaeus made a great contribution to science by developing systems of classification to organize these processes. His principles of organization, especially his system of binomial nomenclature, provided essential tools for entomology.

A total of 344 men and boys lost their lives. Background There were approximately 2,400 workers employed by the Hulton Colliery Company in 1910. On the morning of 21 December, approximately 900 workers arrived for the day shift. They were working five coal seams of the Manchester Coalfield; the Trencherbone, Plodder, Yard, Three-Quarters and Arley mines. Explosion At 7:50am, there was an explosion in the Plodder Mine, which was thought to have been caused by an accumulation of gas from a roof collapse the previous day. That day 349 workers descended the No 3 bank pit shaft to work in the Plodder, Yard and Three Quarters mines. Of those, only four survived to be brought to the surface. One died immediately and one the next day. The two survivors were Joseph Staveley and William Davenport. In addition one man died in the Arley Mine of No. 4 Pit, bringing the total to 344. There was a final fatality that day, William Turton, who died while fighting a fire in No. 3 pit. The men who were working the other mines in the pit worked from No.4 shaft were unharmed. Aftermath It was the second- worst mining accident in England, and the third-worst in Britain; after the Oaks Colliery explosion and Senghenydd Colliery Disaster. Many of the fatalities were from the same family. The worst affected was the Tyldesley family in which Mrs Miriam Tyldesley lost her husband, four sons and two brothers. A relief fund was established for the families and dependants and a total of ¬£145,000 was raised. In 1911, dependants were compensated and given annuities from a number of sources (including the fund). All the victims were members of Permanent Relief Societies to which they paid contributions weekly and most had private life insurance with friendly societies and all were covered by the Workmen‚Äôs Compensation Act 1906 which brought together all (except the private insurance) the compensation to produce a lump sum and annuity for the dependants. John Baxter was the last recipient of payments from the Hulton Colliery Explosion (1910) Relief Fund when he died in January 1973.The Westhoughton Journal, 26 January 1973 The fund was dissolved in 1975 and the remaining assets transferred to other miners' relief funds. Memorials Memorial to the Pretoria miners There is a memorial to the victims in Westhoughton cemetery. A memorial service is held there each year and a selection of artifacts from the disaster is displayed in Westhoughton Central Library. A statue opposite Westhoughton church by Jane Robbins was unveiled on 19 December 2010 almost 100 years after the disaster. Another memorial was erected in 2010 on the 100th anniversary at the end of Broadway on the border between Atherton and Over Hulton funded from by grants and donations. The site is about 300 yards from the No.4 shaft from which the survivors and bodies were raised. On 19 December 2008, an account of the disaster was discovered, written anonymously by a man who accompanied the rescue team. A play, Sleep, Comrade Sleep, was written and performed in 2005 by the staff and students of Westhoughton High School and reprised for the centenary in 2010.http://clc2.uniservity.com/GroupHomepage.asp?GroupId=278528 Westhoughton High School See also List of mining disasters in Lancashire References External links * The Pretoria Pit Disaster LANOPC * Bolton Museum & Archive Service * Joseph Shearer Staveley, Pretoria Pit Survivor * Eyewitness account of the Disaster * Pretoria Disaster grave photographs * 344 - A Story of the Pretoria Pit Disaster by Andrea Jane Finney * The Pretoria Pit Disaster, A Centenary Account.

There remained entomological polyhistors ‚Äì those who continued to work on the insect fauna as a whole. From the beginning of the century, however, the specialist began to predominate, harbingered by Johann Wilhelm Meigen's Nouvelle classification des mouches √† deux aile (New classification of the Diptera) commenced in the first year of the century. Lepidopterists were amongst the first to follow Meigen's lead. The specialists fell into three categories. First there were species describers, then specialists in species recognition and then specialists in gross taxonomy. There were however considerable degrees of overlap. Also then, as now, few could entirely resist the lure of groups other than their own, and this was especially true of those in small countries where they were the sole 'expert', and many famous specialists in one order also worked on others. Hence, for instance, many works which began as butterfly faunas were completed as general regional works, often collaboratively. \\"Man is born not to solve the problems of the universe, but to find out where the problem begins, and then to restrain himself within the limits of the comprehensible\\" Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Conversations with Eckerman: Feb. 13, 1829 1800 * Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de Lamarck first expressed his views on evolution in lectures. * The total number of species of insects described is estimated at not exceeding the figure of 20 000. 1801 *Publication of Jean Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet de Lamarck.

Biography  Born 19 April 1931 in Ladybrand a small agricultural town in the province of Orange Free State (now the province of Free State), he studied law at the University of the Orange Free State and qualified as an attorney. In 1968, Coetsee won the Bloemfontein West seat in the House of Assembly, vacated by J. J. Fouche, who became State President. P. W. Botha appointed him in 1978 as Deputy Minister for Defence and National Intelligence and, in 1980, to the powerful position of Justice Minister. The portfolio of Prisons was added to his responsibilities. On 12 October 1978, Coetsee became Deputy Minister of Defence and National Security. He reorganised National Intelligence after the Information Scandal and adjusted the national service to make sure that people would not suffer financial loss or travel unnecessarily while doing their military service. Coetsee was appointed as Minister of Justice on 7 October 1980. He changed the legal system by introducing the small claims court and pioneering the Matrimonial Property Act in 1984. This act had an important effect on the status of married women and introduced the accrual system of sharing property between spouses. Coetsee also contributed to the process that made community service an alternative option to being jailed and did away with racially specific commissioners‚Äô courts. He was serious about legal reform and in April 1986, he asked for a legal commission to look into the role of the courts in protecting group and individual rights, after which a report on human and group rights had to be drawn up. He also walked the Indemnity Act through parliament, ensuring that those who took part in political negotiations after the unbanning of the African National Congress (ANC) would receive temporary immunity. After the first non-racial democratic elections in South Africa in 1994, he was elected president of the Senate (which was later renamed the National Council of Provinces), although the ANC had a comfortable majority in this chamber of parliament as well. He kept that position until 1997. Meetings with the ANC A series of meetings between him and the imprisoned Nelson Mandela began in 1985. In 1985, he was elected provincial leader of the Orange Free State NP. From 1990 on, he participated in the negotiations between the NP-government and the ANC. In 1993 he also took over the defence portfolio from Roelf Meyer until the elections of 1994. A Fast Attack Craft of the South African Navy was named after him. Kobie Coetsee was married in 1956 and was a father of two sons and three daughters. He died of a heart attack 29 July 2000, in Bloemfontein.

It consists of two campuses in Anambra State. Its main campus is located in the capital of Anambra State, Awka while the second campus is located at Nnewi. Agulu and Ifite-Ogwuari, Anambra State are premises under Awka campus It is one of the federal universities which are overseen and accredited by the National Universities Commission. The university is named after Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.  History  Nnamdi Azikiwe University came into being as an offshoot of the defunct Anambra State University of Technology (ASUTECH). ASUTECH which was established through Law No. 7 of 30 July 1980 by the Government of the old Anambra operated as a multi-campus university, with campuses in Abakiliki, Enugu, Awka and Nnewi. In 1991, following the split of the old Anambra State into Anambra and Enugu States, the Awka and Nnewi campuses of the former ASUTECH were constituted into Nnamdi Azikiwe University by the Anambra State Edict No.5 26 November 1991. Nnamdi Azikiwe University was taken over by the Federal Government by Decree No. 34 on 15 July 1992. In 1991, after the former Anambra State was split into Anambra and Enugu States, the Awka and Nnewi campuses of the former Anambra State University of Technology (ASUTECH) were combined into Nnamdi Azikiwe University, which was later taken over by Federal government.

Eng. biddan, \\"to pray\\", cf. Ger. beten) is the formula of prayer or exhortation to prayer said during worship in churches of the Anglican Communion. It occurs during the liturgy of the word, prior to the sermon. Such formulae are found in the ancient Greek liturgies, e.g. that of St. Chrysostom, in the Gallican liturgy, and in the pre-Reformation liturgies of England. The form varies, but in all the characteristic feature is that the minister tells the people what to pray for (e.g., the 1662 Book of Common Prayer bidding-prayer form begins, \\"Let us pray for the whole state of Christ's Church militant here in earth\\"). It is an informal intercessory prayer, covering a wide variety of concerns such as the church, the state, the living and the dead, and public and private necessities. In England in the 16th century it took the form of a direction to the people what to remember in telling their beads. In the course of time the word bid in the sense of pray became obsolete and was confused with bid in the sense of command (from O. Eng. beodan, to offer, present, and hence to announce, or command; cf. Ger. bieten, to offer, gebieten, to command), and the bidding-prayer came practically to mean the exhortation itself. A form of exhortation which preachers and ministers shall move the people to join with them in prayer is given in the 55th canon of the Church of England (1603). In contemporary usage, the term \\"bidding-prayer\\" has largely been replaced by \\"intercessory prayers\\" or \\"prayers of the people\\". In keeping with Anglican custom, these are still said according to one or more Prayer Book templates, but are generally designed in such a way that specific topical, seasonal, or cyclical petitions can be added. On occasion, the person leading the prayers will still introduce each petition with the phrase, \\"I bid your prayers for...\\" A bidding prayer is offered at the beginning of the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols observed at King's College, Cambridge University, on Christmas Eve; this prayer, whose text has remained largely unaltered since the Festival's inception in 1918, has been heard annually in radio broadcasts of the Festival since the 1930s. Lutheran church services also include bidding prayers, although they are typically called \\"prayers of intercession\\" or \\"prayers of the people\\". Some Methodist churches also include bidding prayers.

Dorset (grey) to the north and the New Forest district of Hampshire (not shown) to the east. The South East Dorset conurbation (also known as the South Dorset conurbation,e.g. Audit Commission, Poole- Bournemouth urban areae.g. Hampshire County Council, and Bournemouth urban area) is a multi-centred conurbation on the south coast of Dorset in England. The area is rapidly becoming an amalgamation with the area of South West Hampshire immediately on the fringe of the newly formed New Forest National Park. The main population centres are Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, which together form the single unitary authority of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole; however, the urbanised area spreads as far east as Barton on Sea in Hampshire. There are a number of satellite towns peripheral to these main urban centres. In clockwise rotation these include: Wareham, Upton, Wimborne, Ferndown, Verwood and Ringwood (Hampshire). The urban area is generally surrounded by a green belt. The 2011 census gave a population of 466,626 for the conurbation defined by the Office for National Statistics as the Bournemouth/Poole Built-up Area, and divided it into six main parts: Bournemouth, Ferndown, Wimborne Minster, Christchurch, New Milton, and Poole. The population of the conurbation increased significantly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses mainly because Ferndown and Wimborne Minster became part of it. The population for the conurbation according to the 2001 and 1991 censuses was 383,713 and 358,321, respectively.Office for National Statistics, Census data The South West England Regional Development Agency and the Highways Agency, which maintain's England's trunk roads, defined a South East Dorset Conurbation, with over 400,000 people.http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081107155048/http://www.highways.gov.uk/business/documents/South_West.pdf The term has also been applied to the Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole boroughs, excluding the surrounding towns, for example, in their recent Joint Local Transport Plan.Bournemouth Borough Council, Local Transport Plan The conurbation is the largest urban area in Britain with no part having city status.

These include *Bransgore *Corfe Mullen *Lytchett Matravers *Lymington *Milford on Sea *Ringwood *St Ives *St Leonards *Verwood *West Moors Transport The conurbation is served by a number of main roads. The M27 motorway, which feeds the M3 to London, ends on the eastern edge of the New Forest near Southampton, but extends west as the A31 trunk road. The A31 serves as a bypass for the conurbation, north of Poole and Bournemouth but south of many of the satellite towns, and is dual carriageway for most of its length. To the west the A31 merges with the A35 at Bere Regis where they continue west to Dorchester and Exeter. The A35 runs through the centres of the main towns in the conurbation. The A338 is the main arterial route in Bournemouth, running as a dual carriageway from Bournemouth town centre to the A31, and as a single carriageway north to Salisbury. The A350 is Poole town centre's main artery, running north along Holes Bay to the A35, and as a single carriageway to Bath and Bristol. The A337 runs east to Lymington and the New Forest. The conurbation is served by the South Western Main Line which runs from London to Weymouth via Winchester, Southampton and Dorchester. There are stations at New Milton, Hinton Admiral, Christchurch, Pokesdown, Bournemouth, Branksome, Parkstone, Poole, Hamworthy and Holton Heath. The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway to Bath had its southern terminus here, until its closure under the Beeching Axe. The Port of Poole has regular ro-ro ferry connections to Cherbourg, Gijon and Santander, high-speed car ferries to the Channel Islands, Cherbourg and St. Malo and a regular all-freight service to the Channel Islands. Bournemouth Airport is the conurbation's closest airport and lies 5 miles north of the town centre. The airport recently undertook a ¬£45 million redevelopment and serves over 50 destinations worldwide; Ryanair and Thomson Airways operate frequent services.

A note in the Victoria County History which was written for this area later than most, in 1989, states in 1901 the prominent western projection of Church ward (shown) formed part of what residents and groups then widely considered Westbourne or Westbourne Green. Westbourne is an area west of Paddington in west London. It has a manorial history spanning many centuries, within a more broadly defined Paddington, before shedding its association in the mid-19th century. It is named after the west bourne, West Bourne, or River Westbourne, a Thames tributary which was encased in 19th- century London in the 1850s. The spring-fed stream and associated manor have led to the place names Westbourne Green, Westbourne Park and more narrowly: Westbourne Gardens, Westbourne Grove, Westbourne Park Road, Westbourne Park tube station, Westbourne Studios and the name of a public house. Westbourne forms or resembles an electoral ward of the local authority which is, since 1965, Westminster City Council, and an ecclesiastical parish in the Church of England. Westbourne Conservation Area is a smaller area, designated by the local authority, in Planning Law. Early history The hamlet of Westbourne, was a High Middle Ages (mid-medieval) settlement, centred on Westbourne Green. It included a mansion house and a farmhouse. It is recorded as Westeburn in 1222 and as Westborn in 1294. The green is recorded as Westborne Grene in 1548, Washborne Green in 1680 and Wesborn Green in 1754. Modern name and definitions The manorial bounds of Westbourne were kept alive by business names and residents' groups and associations after housing development. A short-lived London Underground station existed from 1866 until 1871, when it was replaced by one nearby, to the east. Until 1992, the station had extra platforms on its north side for the overground Great Western Main Line. To the north and east were extensive railway yards. Excellent transport and ease of access of fashionable commerce such as in Marylebone encouraged many City of London affluent workers and the political class of Westminster to live in the area. More recently, the Westbourne Park bus garage was built, replacing railway yards north-east of the station, across the Western Avenue, London. Use of \\"Westbourne\\" unsuffixed by \\"Park\\" or \\"Green\\", has faded but not passed; it has an electoral and a planning definition. #The area resembles and can be defined loosely as Westbourne ward, one of twenty Westminster City Council electoral districts, north of the Westway and around the Great Western Road. Wards are drawn by an independent commission to aim for equality of electorate, instead of containing interrelated housing, to avoid malapportionment. The population at the 2011 Census was 12,759. #A narrower definition is the Westbourne Conservation Area identified since the late 20th century to maintain coherent classical architecture building schemes in Planning Law; its history, structure and layout mirrors the bulk of neighbouring Bayswater. Manor and parish The manor of Westbourne was distinct from the manor of Paddington but, lacking a church, it did not form its own parish. Instead, it was western part of the parish of Paddington through which it paid tithes and received the vestry's administration such as in the poor law. The River Westbourne, running north to south, delimited Westbourne from Paddington. In later years the manorial courts sat across Bayswater and Hyde Park in Knightsbridge; the manor became known as \\"the Manor of Westbourne with Knightsbridge\\".T F T Baker, Diane K Bolton and Patricia E C Croot, 'Paddington: Westbourne Green', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 9, Hampstead, Paddington, ed.

The mansion had three storeys, with the frontage divided into three parts widthwise, and nine windows. The middle portion was topped by a large pediment and contained the further pedimented main door. Each end of the lower two storeys were formed into tri-windowed bays. Residents in turn included: baronet Sir William Yorke, a Venetian ambassador, architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell (a distant relative of diarist Samuel Pepys) and General Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill (Commander-in-Chief of the Army, 1828‚Äì39). Hill gave his name to Lord Hill's Bridge and left the house in 1836. Following Hill's departure, the mansion was demolished and replaced by the current gardened houses of Westbourne Park Villas. Lord Hill's Bridge remains abutting the Villas; it accommodates Royal Oak tube station and joins Porchester Road with Harrow Road below the Westway. Westbourne Farm was centred where the Westway, Harrow Road and Paddington Arm, a canal, converge; in 1815‚Äì17 home to actress Sarah Siddons and her daughter. The actress was buried and has a headstone at St Mary's Church on Paddington Green (then the area's parish). Thomas Hardy lived in this area, mainly at 16 Westbourne Park Villas, his home 1863-67. Brunel, Westmead and Wessex Gardens Estates By the 1960s many of the mansion houses with large grounds had become part of Peter Rachman's property empire; demolished by the local authority after his death to make way for two large housing estates mainly based on meeting social housing needs: the Brunel estate (1970s), and the Wessex Gardens estate (1978), named for the fictional county of many of Hardy's works.Westbourne Park, CityWest Homes, accessed 2014-06-18 In Wessex Gardens the first of 300 homes (dwellings) planned for 1,116 people were ready in 1978. Westmead was built, as 148 homes in 1974, to replace a relatively low-quality segment of housing.

Until it was closed in 1965, Westbourne had a train station known as Bournemouth West Station Terminus. The station was often very busy during the summer seasons, as it was a main disembarkation point for holidaymakers to Poole and Bournemouth. Westbourne also had an ornate cinema called \\"The Grand\\", that was converted into a bingo hall. The bingo hall has since closed. Westbourne is also home to the head office of the Liverpool Victoria Group which has three buildings, Frizzell House in the centre of County Gates roundabout, with Victoria and County Gates houses close by. It is a large local employer with around 1600 staff. Many local traders are members of the Westbourne Traders Association (WTA). The group promotes the interests of the traders and aims to raise the profile of Westbourne to tourists and local residents.

Robert Louis Stevenson was Westbourne's most famous resident, who lived at 'Skerryvore' on the West Cliff between 1885 and 1887. While at this rather ordinary house he wrote Kidnapped and The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, as well as part of Treasure Island while he was recovering from an illness. It is here that John Singer Sergeant painted R.L. Stevenson pacing his drawing room with his wife sitting nearby in 1885 and a novel of his life while residing in Westbourne (published in 1929 titled 'R.L.S and his Sine Qua Non') was written by Adelaide A. Boodle. There is small statue commemorating his work on the site of the house he lived in, which was destroyed in the Second World War. Florence Nightingale had an interest in Westbourne when in 1867 she was a prime mover in the building of the Herbert Home Hospital.

History In 146 BC, the Romans conquered the region, where existed an old city called \\"Tbessa\\". Theveste was founded by the Romans in 75 AD near an old Berber village located next to the Aur√®s Mountains, in order to control the mountain region. During the 1st century CE, the Legio III Augusta resided there before being transferred to Lambaesis. It was made a colonia probably under Trajan. Theveste flourished under Septimius Severus reaching a population calculated in nearly 30,000 inhabitants, and was even an important Dioceses See. There is mention of a council held there by the Donatists. Among its saints were Lucius, its bishop, who assisted at the Council of Carthage (256) and died as a martyr two years later; Maximilianus, martyred 12 March, 295 AD; and Crispina, martyred 5 December, 304 AD. Some of its bishops are known: Romulus in 349 AD; Urbicus in 411 AD; Felix exiled by the Vandals in 484 AD; and Palladius mentioned in an inscription. During the 4th and 5th century AD, Thebeste was a centre of Manichaeism as well. In June 1918 a codex of 26 leaves written in Latin by Manichaeans was discovered in a cave near the city.A month later Henri Omont found the missing initial 13 leaves. The whole book is now known as the Tebessa codex and it is kept in Cologne. It has been edited by Markus Stein (Bonn). Theveste was raided by the Vandals, but it was rebuilt at the beginning of the reign of Justinian I by the patricius Solomon. He erected a tomb there, which still exists. The city was nearly destroyed by Umayyad Caliphate forces, but a small village (probably initially populated by a few surviving Christian Berbers) remained for centuries.Under the Ottoman Empire, Theveste had a garrison of Janizaries. In 1851 it has been occupied by the French. Under the name of Tebessa it became the capital of a canton of the Department of Constantine in Algeria. Modern Tebessa is very rich in ancient monuments, among them being a triumphal arch of Caracalla, a temple, a Christian basilica of the 4th century and the huge walls. Main architectural remains The Roman Forum of Theveste Around the Roman Forum it is possible to see even today the remains of: *Arch of Caracalla, a Roman triumphal arch dating from 214 AD. This edifice, which was the North entrance to the town is positioned as a square at the junction of two roads. The four facades of this door are all identical. *Temple of Minerva (early 3rd century AD), with walls decorated by mosaics. The Minerva Temple dates from the beginning of the 3rd Century. The interior walls of this Temple are ornamented with beautiful mosaics. One finds inside it various prehistoric articles (money, arms, lamps, etc.) *Remains of the Basilica of St. Crispinus (4th century AD), one of the biggest in Africa. It also has chapels, baptism urns, catacombs and gardens. The basilica is situated at the exterior of the old city at the north of the Arc of Caracalla. There are various pathways, huge steps, stables, walkways, and many Roman edifices around. This basilica is consecrated to a local Saint, Saint Crispina, and dates from the end of the 4th Century. *Byzantine walls (6th century), popularly known as \\"Solomon's Walls\\" and flanked by thirteen square towers. The Solomon wall encircles the old town centre. These walls are flanked by towers which open onto the outside by four doors. One of these four doors is an Arc de Triomphe (Caracalla's door). *Roman theatre.

Affiliated with the United Church of Canada, it is a member institution of the Toronto School of Theology. The current principal is Michelle Voss Roberts. Emmanuel College is a member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. History Emmanuel College Emmanuel College has its origins in Victoria College, a Methodist college founded in 1836.University of Toronto From 1871 it operated a Faculty of Theology training candidates for the ministry of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. In 1884, with the merger of the Wesleyan Methodists and the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) into a single Methodist Church of Canada, the seminary the MEC had established at Albert University in 1857 merged into Victoria. When the merger in turn to create the United Church of Canada took place in 1925, a number of congregations in the Presbyterian Church in Canada chose to remain a distinct denomination. Knox College, University of Toronto, founded as the Free Church rival to Queen's during the Disruption of 1843 and favourable to church union, was expected to serve as the new church's main seminary. However, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario awarded the building to the continuing Presbyterians. The faculty and most students of Knox left to form \\"Union College\\" with the Faculty of Theology at Victoria. Shortly renamed Emmanuel College, the new college became affiliated with the University of Toronto as a United Church of Canada seminary in 1925. The Emmanuel College main building was designed by architect Henry Sproatt. In 1969 the Toronto School of Theology (TST) was created as an independent federation of 7 schools of theology, including the divinity faculties of Emmanuel College. Within its own federation, U of T granted all but theology or divinity degrees. In May 1974, along with the other federated universities, St. Michael's and Trinity, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed with the University of Toronto, establishing the terms of their new relationship with the Faculty of Arts and Science. Since 1978, by virtue of a change made in its charter, the University of Toronto has granted theology degrees conjointly with Emmanuel College and other TST's member institutions. Popular culture Emmanuel College was the scene in which the British band Tears for Fears filmed the music video for their song \\"Head over Heels\\" in the summer of 1985. References * Kenneth H.

These were developed by the European Committee for Standardisation upon the request of the European Commission.EN 1990:2002 E, Eurocode - Basis of Structural Design, CEN, November 29, 2001 The purpose of the eurocodes is to provide: * a means to prove compliance with the requirements for mechanical strength and stability and safety in case of fire established by European Union law.European Council Directive 89/106/EEC * a basis for construction and engineering contract specifications. * a framework for creating harmonized technical specifications for building products (CE mark). By March 2010, the Eurocodes are mandatory for the specification of European public works and are intended to become the de facto standard for the private sector. The Eurocodes therefore replace the existing national building codes published by national standard bodies (e.g. BS 5950), although many countries had a period of co-existence. Additionally, each country is expected to issue a National Annex to the Eurocodes which will need referencing for a particular country (e.g. The UK National Annex). At present, take-up of Eurocodes is slow on private sector projects and existing national codes are still widely used by engineers. The motto of the Eurocodes is ‚ÄúBuilding the future‚Äù.https://eurocodes.jrc.ec.europa.eu The second generation of the Eurocodes (2G Eurocodes) is being prepared.https://eurocodes.jrc.ec.europa.eu/showpage.php?id=63 History In 1975, the Commission of the European Community (presently the European Commission), decided on an action programme in the field of construction, based on article 95 of the Treaty. The objective of the programme was to eliminate technical obstacles to trade and the harmonisation of technical specifications. Within this action programme, the Commission took the initiative to establish a set of harmonised technical rules for the design of construction works which, in a first would serve as an alternative to the national rules in force in the member states of the European Union (EU) and, ultimately, would replace them. For fifteen years, the Commission, with the help of a steering committee with representatives of the member states, conducted the development of the Eurocodes programme, which led to the first generation of European codes in the 1980s. In 1989, the Commission and the member states of the EU and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) decided, on the basis of an agreement between the Commission and to transfer the preparation and the publication of the Eurocodes to the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) through a series of mandates, in order to provide them with a future status of European Standard (EN). This links de facto the Eurocodes with the provisions of all the Council's Directives and/or Commission's Decisions dealing with European standards (e.g. Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 on the marketing of construction products and Directive 2014/24/EU on government procurement in the European Union). List The eurocodes are published as a separate European Standards, each having a number of parts.

Design Yoshino was a typical Elswick cruiser design, with a steel housing, divided into waterproof compartments, a low forecastle, twin funnels, and two masts. The prow was reinforced for ramming. The power plant was a triple expansion reciprocating steam engine with four cylindrical boilers, driving two screws.Chesneau, Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860‚Äì1905, pp. 226‚Äì227. The main armament of Yoshino consisted of four separate Elswick QF 6 inch /40 naval guns behind gun shields, which were placed as bow and stern guns and in sponsons near the bridge. Secondary armament consisted of eight Elswick QF 4.7 inch Gun Mk I‚ÄìIV quick-firing guns mounted on the sides of the hull and 22 QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss guns. Service record At Yokosuka in 1896 Yoshino was laid down in February 1892, launched on 20 December 1892 and completed on 30 September 1893. Soon after being placed into service, Yoshino was assigned to patrol duties off of the coast of Korea due to increasing tension between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of China. =First Sino-Japanese War= On 25 July 1894, Yoshino, and , met two Chinese ships off the Korean coast in the Yellow Sea. The Beiyang Fleet cruiser and gunboat had sortied from Asan to meet another Chinese gunboat, Caojiang and the leased transport Kowshing transporting 1,100 troops and supplies as reinforcements to the Chinese garrison in Korea. Although not at war, the Japanese and Chinese squadrons exchanged gunfire in what was later called the Battle of Pungdo, with Guangyi driven onto rocks and destroyed, Caojiang captured, and Jiyuan taking considerable damage before retreating. Yoshino despite its vaunted superior speed, was unable to catch Jiyuan before it disappeared into a fog bank. The transport Kowshing was sunk by Naniwa during the battle.Paine, The Sino- Japanese War of 1894-1895: Perception, Power, and Primacy pages 133‚Äì134 After the formal declaration of hostilities, Yoshino continued to participate in the First Sino-Japanese War, including the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 17 September 1894.

From vehicle tanks The rate of fuel theft is accelerating as fuel prices climb, which makes more employees tempted to steal fuel. Employees can siphon fuel from fuel tanks or use special devices to make it difficult to detect that fuel is gradually leaving the fuel tank. That employee-related crime now costs the United States trucking industry $2.1 billion a year. Vehicle tracking systems are used by some companies to monitor cases of fuel theft and to raise effectiveness of fleet usage. From filling stations Gasoline theft (sometimes known colloquially as fill and fly, gas and dash, and drive-off) is the removal of gasoline from a station without payment. The thief will usually use some form of decoy to prevent nearby witnesses from noticing the lack of payment until they have left the station. Common decoys include pretending to press the wrong buttons after the credit card are swiped or having multiple people get gas at the same time, with one paying for another person and the other running off with both cars. With typical gas thefts costing station owners in the range of $50 per incident, many stores have fought back by installing better video equipment and requiring prepayment. Since the oil price increases after 2004, a surge in fuel theft has occurred, which has included license plate thefts (when gasoline is stolen with the vehicle having the original tags and the vehicle tags identifying the registered owner). From pipelines Oil and gasoline are stolen by illegal taps in petroleum pipelines, and billions of dollars worth of product are stolen annually. Targets are the petroleum industry in Nigeria, the Nembe Creek Trunk Line, the Ceyhan-Kƒ±rƒ±kkale Oil Pipeline, and the petroleum industry in Mexico.

Founded in 1930, it is the Jesuit school of theology in Canada and a member institution of the Toronto School of Theology. History =Foundation= Regis College began as the Jesuit philosophy college on Wellington Street in downtown Toronto in September 1930. It then offered philosophy programmes to Jesuit scholastics preparing for priesthood. It was in 1943 that the programme of offerings was expanded to include theology. In 1954, the Jesuit seminary was formally named Collegium Christi Regis, The College of Christ the King. In 1956 Regis College was accredited as a pontifical faculty (a status it retains) by becoming the School of Theology of St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and thus became able to offer ecclesiastical degrees in theology. =Bayview Avenue site= In 1961, the college moved to a new site on Bayview Avenue in Willowdale, Toronto. There, it taught exclusively theology. The 40 acre site, was offered to the Jesuits as a location for the college by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1958. In 1969, Regis College was one of the founding colleges of the Toronto School of Theology. Within its own federation, the University of Toronto granted all but the theology or divinity degrees. In 1970, the college joined the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. Membership was granted in 1980, and renewed in 2001 and 2011. =St. Mary Street site= In 1976, the college moved to St. Mary Street in Downtown Toronto, close to its present site. The Bayview site was sold to Ontario Bible College, which became the Tyndale University College and Seminary in 2003. That year, it admitted its first non-Jesuit students. Since 1978, by virtue of a change made in its charter, the University of Toronto has granted theology degrees conjointly with Regis College. Regis College became a federated college of the University of Toronto. This arrangement was renewed for a further ten years in 2004. =Present location= thumb In August 2008, Regis College agreed to move to Christie House, on the corner of Wellesley Street and Queen's Park. It was formerly a female residence building for St. Michael's College administered by the Sisters of St. Joseph who ran St. Joseph's College School next door. The University of Toronto bought the site from the Sisters of St. Joseph and leases it to the college. Construction started to make the house suitable for the college in time for the start of the academic year in September 2009. As part of the leasing agreement with the university, the half of the building closest to the school was converted so that it could be used by the university's Faculty of Music. The building is located opposite the Parliament of Ontario. It is to the south of St. Michael's College and is next to buildings that previously housed the offices of Marshall McLuhan. The building itself was the former home of William Mellis Christie and after his death it was the residence of his son Robert Jaffrey. Robert Jaffrey had a secret room built in the house so his mistress could secretly live with him and his family. The mistress killed herself in this secret room, and is said to haunt the college. Academics In the traditions of Jesuit spirituality, scholarship and service, Regis College promotes an integrated spirituality that emphasizes justice, critical dialogue and academic pursuits. As per all Jesuit institutions, it remains grounded in the concept of ad maiorem Dei gloriam, for the greater glory of God. Regis College confers three major types of theological degrees: basic degree programmes, graduate degree programmes, and ecclesiastical degrees. Civil degrees are awarded conjointly by Regis College and the University of Toronto and ecclesiastical degrees are awarded solely by Regis College. =Civil degrees= * Basic degree programmes :* Master of Theological Studies (MTS) ::* First Studies stream ::* Integrating Studies stream ::* Theology, Spirituality, and the Arts Stream :* Master of Arts in Ministry and Spirituality (MA in MS) ::* The Pastoral Praxis stream ::* The Ministry of Spiritual Direction stream :* Master of Divinity (MDiv) * Graduate degree programmes :* Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MA) ::* M.A. Option I stream (master's research paper) ::* M.A. Option II stream (course-only option) :* Master of Theology (ThM) ::* Th.M.

It is a member of the Toronto School of Theology. History St. Augustine's Seminary was established in 1913 to train diocesan priests. The land which the Seminary was built was originally that of farmer and Anglican Adna Pherrill (1816-1892). Its construction was funded entirely by Eugene O'Keefe, a wealthy Toronto brewer and philanthropist who died months before its completion. The Beaux-Arts architecture structure is topped off with a copper clad dome. The architect was Arthur W. Holmes who designed numerous buildings in Toronto, such as St. Patrick's Church, Holy Name Church as well as St. Michael's College, part of the University of Toronto. He modelled the college chapel on the refectory of Queen's College, Oxford.Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada 1800-1950 retrieved 4 February 2014 In 1969 the Toronto School of Theology was created as an independent federation of 7 schools of theology, including the divinity faculties of St. Augustine's Seminary.

Station history =MOR music to Family Radio= The station signed on the air on December 31, 1959 as WKDN-FM. In 1966, the station was airing a MOR music format and was co-owned with WKDN (800 AM), which changed calls to WTMR after the two stations were sold to separate owners in 1968. Family Stations, Inc., the holding company for stations run by Harold Camping's Family Radio religious ministry, acquired WKDN-FM for $500,000 on July 23, 1968. Under Family Stations' ownership, programming on WKDN (the \\"-FM\\" suffix was dropped from the call sign in June 1986) consisted mainly of Christian radio and teachings from Family Radio, along with some public affairs programming on weekends.

Signal and facilities From the first sign-on until April 16, 2012, WKDN transmitted from a broadcast tower located in Camden, New Jersey, approximately 12 miles southeast of most other Philadelphia FM signals; as a result, the station enjoyed a better than average signal in southern New Jersey, especially in the Jersey Shore counties of Atlantic, Monmouth, Ocean, and Cape May. Under Family Radio, WKDN also operated three FM translator stations: W207AB (89.3 FM) in Atlantic City, New Jersey; W207AE (89.3 FM) in Reading, Pennsylvania; and W249AA (97.7 FM) in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. These translators were not part of the station's sale to Merlin. W207AB and W207AE continue to broadcast Family Radio programming through a satellite feed of its Sacramento station, KEBR. (W249AA currently simulcasts WLEB-LP.) WKDN's studios under Family Radio ownership were located at 2906 Mt. Ephraim Avenue in Haddon Township, New Jersey. At the \\"IQ 106.9\\" debut on April 16, 2012, the station transmitted from a broadcast tower located on the spire of One Liberty Place in Center City with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 9,000 watts at a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 244 meters.

In 531, together with his Lakhmid allies, he led an invasion across the Euphrates into the Byzantine region of Commagene (more probably Chalybonitis). When the Byzantine army under Belisarius approached, they withdrew east, halting at Callinicum. In the ensuing battle, the Byzantines suffered a heavy defeat, but Persian losses too were so high that the Persian king Kavadh I (r. 488‚Äì531) was displeased with him and relieved him of his command. He only reappears in the sources once, in 544, when he accompanied Kavadh's successor, Khosrau I (r. 531‚Äì579), at the siege of Edessa (544). In the last stage of the siege, when the Persians under Khosrow I withdrew from their second general assault, Azarethes and his men were the only Persians who were still fighting and making progress at one of the city gates.

This transmission was originally used in the US specification 1982 Volvo 240 with the B21F engine, as well as in 1983 with the B23F engine. The AW70 did not see worldwide usage until 1984 in certain 240 series cars. The AW70 transmission was not the only automatic transmission used in cars of this era. Some of the 1985-87 B230F-equipped 740's came with a ZF 4HP22 transmission (designated by a gearshift labeled \\"P R N D 3 2 1\\"). The AW70 (gearshift labeled \\"P R N D 2 1\\" with a side-mounted overdrive lockout) is widely considered significantly more reliable than the ZF 4HP22 transmission.

Some have been seen in 1985-87 240s with the B230F engine. Also was used in late model European-spec Volvo 260 series cars. North American market Volvo 260 cars used the Borg Warner Type 55 transmission. Identical to the Toyota A43D and A43DL except with different tailshaft housings and tailshaft flanges, both of which are interchangeable. AW72 An automatic gearbox built by Aisin of Japan used the Volvo 16-valve B234F 4-cylinder engine found in the 740 GLE. This gearbox is a modified AW71 with different ratios to leverage the unique power curve characteristics produced by the 16-valve head (when compared to the 8-valve B230F/FT with an AW71 gearbox).

Garbuna contains a large thermal field, probably Papua New Guinea's largest. Until recently, it was assumed that the Garbuna volcano was probably dormant, or perhaps extinct. The last eruption was believed to have occurred around 1300 AD, or 700 years ago. Evidence from past eruptions indicates large amounts of tephra and lava were produced. However, on 17 October 2005 the Garbuna volcano erupted without warning. Ash was reported 4,000 m above the summit. An ash warning for aircraft was distributed by the Darwin office of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on 19 October, by which time a second new vent had appeared. Ash was apparently drifting to the north-west on 19 October and had contaminated some village water supplies. Eruptions continued into November 2005, although less violently. By January 2006, the main activity was limited to volumes of white vapour being discharged from the new vents. Garbuna is less than 20 km to the west of Kimbe, the main urban centre of West New Britain and the location of an important palm oil industry.

Within the Sol Plaatje Local Municipality in the Northern Cape Province, it is named after Kgosi Galeshewe. History The township of Galeshewe was founded in 1878 after diamonds were discovered at kopje (hill) near Colesberg in 1871. The diamond rush which followed the discovery of diamonds saw an influx of people from all over, seeking fortune in the sprawling town of Kimberley. In 1873 Kimberley's population had grown to 40,000. The first parts of Galeshewe sprung up in the early 1870s to accommodate the migrant labour population in Kimberley. In 1886, the first large compounds for workers known as the Greater No 2 were introduced at the De Beers Mine. Galeshewe started to grow west from the Greater No 2 in the 1930s. The central part of the present Galeshewe was built between 1950s and 1970s. In 1952 the Native Advisory Committee of Kimberley approved a recommendation from residents to name the township Galeshewe after Kgosi (Chief) Galeshewe of the Batlhaping tribe. On 1 August 1973, the Kimberley Council granted control of Galeshewe township to the Bantu Administration Board of the Diamond Fields. A May 5, 1976 edition of the Kimberley newspaper \\"The Diamond Fields Advertiser\\" reported that ‚Äúslums‚Äù in the township were a problem with at least 9 or 10 people living in a four- roomed house. This problem was because of the lack of suitable housing and the ongoing problem of unemployment. On 2 January 1978, the Community Board took over the control of the township. Galeshewe Municipality was inaugurated on 30 November 1983 making the township the first Black-controlled municipality in South Africa. According to a report by the Galeshewe town council, the population of the township was 81202, and made up of 10110 families. There were 10327 residential sites, of which 9525 were still being developed. The township had 10 creche sites, 68 parks, 71 business sites (64 developed), 54 church sites (12 developed) and 30 school sites. In 1988 there were several new suburbs making up Greater Galeshewe. No 2 was still there, but there was also Ikageng (Redirile, and referred to as Stocks and Stocks), Ikageleng, Retswele, KwaNobantu, Zone Six (Extension Six), Ipeleng, and Vergenoeg. In 1994, after the election of South Africa's first democratic government, Galeshewe became part of the Sol Plaatje Local Municipality. Mayibuye Uprising On 7 November 1952, Greater No 2, Galeshewe ANC, leader Dr Arthur Letele organised a group of volunteers to defy the segregation laws by sitting on the 'Europeans Only' benches at the Kimberley Station in support of the ANC's Defiance Campaign. They were arrested and fined ¬£3 or 10 days imprisonment. They all opted for the latter. A day later on 8 November, a group of men shouted political slogans, giving the Defiance Campaign salute and were ordered out of the Municipal African Beer Hall in No. 2 Location, Galeshewe because they were doing the salutes in the beer hall. This led to a riot and the destruction of six buildings in the township, including the police station, two nearby clinics, a power station and a cr√®che. Kimberley police fired at the rioters as they approached the city centre. Thirteen people were killed and 78 others wounded. At dawn the following morning the police detained Dr Arthur Letele, Sam Phakedi, Pepys Madibane, Olehile Sehume, Alexander Nkoane, Daniel Chabalala and David Mpiwa, who were regarded as the ringleaders. On 12 November 1952, a mass funeral was held at the field next to the Methodist Church at the corners of Mzikinya, Rhabe and Sanduza Streets in Galeshewe. The deceased were all buried at the Kimberley West End Cemetery. The uprising and massacre came to be known as the Mayibuye Uprising. On November 2002, a sculpture of a clenched fist with a raised thumb was unveiled in Galeshewe in honour of the Mayibuye Uprising.  Galeshewe Now  According to Census 2011, Galeshewe has a population of 107, 920 people, half of Sol Plaatje Local Municipality. 92.2 of the township's population is Black [African , 7.28% is Coloured, 0.22% Indian Asian, 0.07% White and 0.30% is identified as \\"other\\". 56,8% of the population speaks Setswana with Afrikaans being the second-most spoken language at 24,9%. Out of the 25,429 households in Galeshewe, 54,6% have access to clean drinking water and 78,1% have electricity for lighting. The Sol Plaatje Local Municipality: Integrated Development Plan - IDP (2017 ‚Äì 2022), which also includes Galeshewe, states that 31.9% of the population in the area is unemployed. The youth make up 41.7% of the unemployed population in the municipality. 14,8% of the households in the township do not have a source of income while 20,4% (highest percentage) has an income between R19,601 and R38,200. The township's formal housing sits at 74,3%. There are three main health facilities in Galeshewe; the Galeshewe Day Hospital, MaDoyle Clinic and the Galeshewe Clinic. The township has a central police station known as the Galeshewe Police Station. The key points for sports and entertainment in the township are Galeshewe Stadium and the Galeshewe Open Air Arena.

The story is said by Morrison to be based upon his diaries and is also said to be partly autobiographical. Publication history It originally appeared in Trident (which was Trident Comics' anthology title) issues 1-4 in black and white. =Collected editions= In 1990 it was compiled into a single edition and reprinted by Trident Comics in colour. This edition quickly went out of print and for many years it remained out of print as Trident Comics had gone out of business in 1991. It was later reprinted by Oni Press in 1998. Plot St.Swithin's Day tells the story of an alienated British teenager in the 1980s and in particular, Margaret Thatcher's time as British Prime Minister. We first meet the lead character, a teenager (who is not given a name in the story) shoplifting a copy of Catcher in the Rye from a London bookshop. He says, \\"I hate the rain. Everything bad happens in the rain.\\" His reason for stealing the book is not clear beyond him saying they can find it in his pocket \\"when this is all over\\". During the course of the story we find out that the teenager is from an unnamed northern British town or city, stealing his housemates' unemployment benefits to come to London to assassinate Margaret Thatcher while she makes a public appearance at a technical college. We see he has a gun to shoot her and she is due to appear on July 15, which is Saint Swithin's Day, hence the title of the comic. Much of the strip is made up of the teenager preparing himself to assassinate Thatcher and exploring his own teenage angst. The final chapter starts with the teenager waiting for Thatcher after writing \\"neurotic boy outsider\\" on his forehead. It is raining on the day and the teenager manages to get near to Thatcher and starts to pull out what the reader thinks is the previously seen gun. However we see it is actually his hand and as he points his hand at Thatcher he says \\"bang\\" shortly before her bodyguards leap upon him and begin beating him. While being beaten the teenager thinks, \\"it was worth it just to see her scared\\". The last scenes are of the teenager traveling on a train on a sunny day and his final lines are \\"I don't care if it rains. I really don't care at all.\\" Reaction and controversy Reaction to the story was hugely positive within the comics community. However the story of its publication had been picked up by the British tabloid newspaper The Sun, a pro-Thatcher newspaper. They ran an item on the story under the headline \\"DEATH TO MAGGIE BOOK SPARKS TORY UPROAR\\" with quotes from MPs such as Teddy Taylor condemning the book. This even led to questions being asked in the House of Commons about the comic. All this proved great publicity for Trident Comics and they took advantage of it, even going as far to reprint The Sun's article in advertising for the reprint edition.

The seat of the bishop is St. Peter's Cathedral in Scranton, PA. Other cities in the diocese include Wilkes- Barre, Williamsport, Hazleton, Nanticoke, Carbondale, and Pittston. The diocese comprises Lackawanna, Luzerne, Bradford, Susquehanna, Wayne, Tioga, Sullivan, Wyoming, Lycoming, Pike, and Monroe counties, all in the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. The area of the diocese is . On February 23, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Monsignor Joseph C. Bambera the tenth Bishop of Scranton. Bambera was ordained and installed as bishop on April 26, 2010, at St. Peter's Cathedral. Cardinal Justin Rigali, Archbishop of Philadelphia, served as principal consecrator and James Timlin, Bishop Emeritus of Scranton, and John Dougherty, former Auxiliary Bishop of Scranton, served as co-consecrators. Pietro Sambi, the Apostolic Nuncio (papal ambassador) to the United States, read the papal appointment letter. Early history The first Catholic settlers in the area were principally of Irish and German descent. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Slavic and Italian populations attracted by the coal-mining industry came to comprise one-half of the Catholic population. Although many of the early settlers were Catholic immigrants, the first official visit of a priest to this territory of which there is any authentic record was not until 1787. In that year (during the suppression of the Society of Jesus) the former Jesuit James Pellentz (1727‚Äì1800)Jakob Pellentz was a native of Messenich in the diocese of Trier in Germany. He ceased being a Jesuit when the society was dissolved by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. He was a Vicar General of Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore. traveled from Baltimore up the Susquehanna River as far as Elmira, New York, ministering to the Catholics scattered through this region. A few years later, the famous French settlement of Asylum or \\"Azilum\\" was founded (1793‚Äì94). Planned as a retreat for French nobility, the site chosen was on the banks of the Susquehanna River, opposite the present village of Standing Stone in Bradford County. Today scarcely a trace of this unique settlement remains. The earliest permanent Catholic settlements were at Friendsville and Silver Lake in Susquehanna County. These, as well as the other Catholic settlers scattered throughout this district, were attended occasionally by priests sent from Philadelphia. In 1825 ‚Äì largely due to the solicitations of Patrick Griffin, father of Gerald Griffin ‚Äì Francis Kenrick, Bishop of Philadelphia, sent the Rev. John O'Flynn as the first resident pastor. His work, however, was similar to that of a missionary, as his field of labor comprised thirteen counties in northeastern Pennsylvania and five counties in New York state. The first church in the diocese was built in 1825 near Silver Lake. Father O'Flynn died at Danville in 1829, and was succeeded by Father Clancy. On February 1, 1836, Henry Fitzsimmons was sent to take charge of this territory and took up his residence in Carbondale, where a church had been built in 1832. In 1838 John Vincent O'Reilly was sent by Kenrick to assist in administering to the Catholics of this extensive territory. He took up his residence at Silver Lake and his charge comprised Susquehanna, Bradford, Tioga, Potter and Sullivan counties in Pennsylvania and the five adjoining counties in New York. The early history of the diocese is intimately bound to the labors of Father O'Reilly and the foundations of many present parishes were the results of his missionary zeal.

In the autumn of 1842, he opened a college at St. Joseph's, Susquehanna County. Under his supervision, it grew and flourished and, in the 22 years of its existence, the college educated two bishops and over 20 priests. It was destroyed by fire on January 1, 1864, and was never rebuilt. St. Thomas College was established in 1888 and came under the direction of the Christian Brothers. In 1938, it was elevated to become the University of Scranton. The Society of Jesus took charge of its governance in 1942. Marywood University, also in Scranton, was founded and is operated by the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. King's College in Wilkes-Barre is operated by the Congregation of the Holy Cross. And, in Dallas, Misericordia University was founded by the Religious Sisters of Mercy in 1924. In the 1940s, it opened the South Scranton Catholic High School, later Bishop Klonowski High School. The school closed in 1982. Note: This includes Due to rapidly declining enrollment and mounting financial obligations, Joseph Martino employed the Meitler Consultants to assess the Catholic schools and provide recommendations to restructure the education system. The final decisions, made in January 2007, resulted in the consolidation of all schools as under direct diocesan control. It created four regional systems (as shown below), and closed many individual schools. All of the secondary education centers in Lackawanna and Luzerne Counties were closed and replaced by two regional schools: Holy Cross High School to serve Lackawanna County and Holy Redeemer High School to serve Luzerne County. The curriculum of the diocese was standardized to promote continuity and uniformity in the education of the students, and improvements have been visible in the results of college attendance and standardized test results, which consistently rank well above the area's public schools. In April 2010, Bishop Joseph Bambera announced an adjustment of the diocesan school system, which dealt with financial contributions, marketing, and promotion of the schools, and the closure of four elementary school sites. As of the 2011-2012 school year, the Diocese of Scranton operates six early childhood centers, sixteen elementary schools and four high schools, as shown below (in alphabetical order of the municipality in which they occur).

The Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia were not included, as they had been the subjects of earlier investigations. On July 27, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered that a redacted copy of the grand jury report be released to the public. On August 6, 2018, the Diocese released a statement stating that Bishop Bambera would cooperate with the investigation and publish the list of \\"credibly accused clergy\\" when the grand jury report is published. The grand jury report was published on August 14, 2018 and showed that 301 clergy were accused of sexually abusing of children, with 59 coming from the Diocese of Scranton. On August 31, 2018, Bishop Bambera forbade former bishop James Timlin from representing the diocese in public, given Timlin's failure to protect children from abusers. Bambera himself had served as the Vicar for Priests for the Diocese of Scranton from 1995 to 1998, and he admitted that during that time he had helped then-Bishop Timlin reassign a priest who had abused a minor, although the decision was made by Timlin. Bambera emphasized that since becoming bishop in 2010, he has pursued a zero-tolerance policy toward clerical abuse. On August 14, 2020, it was revealed that the Diocese of Scranton, along with the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and fellow suffragan Dioceses in Pittsburgh and Allentown, was enduring the bulk of 150 new lawsuits filed against all eight Pennsylvania Catholic dioceses.https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/08/2-years-after-grand- jury-report-on-pa-clergy-sex-abuse-lawsuits-roll-in.html Of these new lawsuits, 30 were filed against the Diocese of Scranton.https://www.citizensvoice.com/news/diocese-faces-several-new- lawsuits/article_854266ed-c785-5636-8b15-ba880c007e97.html See also * Catholic Church by country * Catholic Church in the United States * Ecclesiastical Province of Philadelphia * Global organisation of the Catholic Church * List of Roman Catholic archdioceses (by country and continent) * List of Roman Catholic dioceses (alphabetical) (including archdioceses) * List of Roman Catholic dioceses (structured view) (including archdioceses) * List of the Catholic dioceses of the United States References Books   External links * Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton Official Site Scranton, Pennsylvania Religious organizations established in 1868 Scranton Scranton ","title":"Roman Catholic Diocese of Scranton"},{"id":"2944550","text":"Jean-Paul Aron (27 May 1925 ‚Äì 20 August 1988) was a French writer, philosopher and journalist.

After playing for several amateur sides in the Birmingham area, Jenkyns joined Small Heath (later renamed Birmingham) in 1888, and was at the club as they first joined the Football Alliance in 1889 and then became founder members of the Football League Second Division in 1892. By now he had made his debut for Wales and was club captain; he skippered Small Heath to promotion to the First Division in 1894, beating Darwen 3‚Äì1 in a test match. Known as one of the most rugged defenders of his era, he was sent off four times whilst playing for Small Heath and that at a time when such occurrences were extremely rare. His career at Small Heath ended in March 1895 when he was released after an incident at Derby where, after being ordered from the field, he attempted to assault two spectators. Jenkyns moved to London in April 1895, joining Woolwich Arsenal, who had joined the Second Division less than two years ago. He was immediately made Arsenal captain, and made his mark in Arsenal history by becoming the club's first ever international player, after winning a cap for Wales against Scotland on 21 March 1896. Playing at centre-half (which in those days was a midfield position), Jenkyns scored six times in 27 matches for Arsenal and was regarded by the club as one of their star players. However, his stay at the Gunners did not last long; in the summer of 1896 he moved to Newton Heath (who later became Manchester United). Jenkyns made his debut for the club on 1 September 1896 against Gainsborough Trinity. He spent two seasons with the Manchester club, taking over as captain from James McNaught, helping them to runners-up position in the Second Division in 1897. In November 1897, he left the club for Walsall, where he spent five years before joining Coventry City. After retirement, Jenkyns ran a public house in Moxley , The George Inn, before joining the police force.

The latter includes: clothing, furniture, household items, electronics and electrical appliances. In Germany, Tchibo's slogan is \\"Every week a new world\\" (). Tchibo has further expanded its product range to sell services such as travel, insurance, and mobile-phone contracts. With over 1,000 shops, Tchibo is one of Germany's largest retail chains. The company is headquartered in Hamburg. Tchibo's coffee is sold in supermarkets and other smaller stores in the United States, Canada, Czechia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Hungary, Ukraine, Syria, Israel, Jordan, Russia, United Arab Emirates, Poland, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Lebanon. It is also sold online. History =Founding= Shop in Darmstadt Tchibo was founded in 1949 in Hamburg by Carl Tchilinghiryan and Max Herz, and still maintains its headquarters in the north of the city. The name Tchibo is an abbreviation for Tchiling and (coffee beans). During its formative years, Tchibo concentrated on a mail-order service of freshly roasted coffee beans, processed in the company's own roasting facility in the Hamburg district of Hoheluft. =Expansion= In 1977, Tchibo purchased shares of Beiersdorf and in 1980 became the majority shareholder of the Hamburg cigarette producer Reemtsma. In 1986, they tried their luck in the video game console market and released the Tele-Fever home video game console. It sold only very few units. The shares were sold in 2002 to Imperial Tobacco for ‚Ç¨5.2 billion. After buying its rival Eduscho in 1997, Tchibo became the market leader in Germany with 20%. In the 1990s, Tchibo began to expand to countries outside Germany and now has shops in Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Turkey. Entry into the US market was planned in the early 2000s, but later cancelled. Tchibo sold the cigarette brand Davidoff to the UK-based company Imperial Tobacco for ‚Ç¨540 mil. in 2006; the rights for the brand Davidoff caf√© remained with Tchibo. Tchibo has started distribution of its brand Davidoff caf√© to the US. =Reorganisation= Tchibo Cafissimo coffeemaker The company presented a reorganisation programme to its employees at a staff meeting on 7 December 2007, with the aim of returning the business to growth by 2010. In the UK, following a consultation period, Tchibo GB decided to close half of its retail stores and re-structure the head office and field teams. The UK board was reduced from 11 directors to 4. In November 2008, a Tchibo spokesman announced that the concessions in Somerfield and Sainsbury's supermarkets would close in 2009, blaming difficult macroeconomic conditions in Britain. Tchibo's lack of success in the British market was summarised by Retail Week as due to it being \\"a glorified pound shop\\". In early 2009, the company confirmed it would leave the UK market, by selling its leases. All of the Tchibo GB stores were closed by the end of October 2009. The UK online webstore followed on 1 September 2010. A \\"new and improved\\" Tchibo Online Shop was launched in the UK on 28 June 2016 In August 2016, Tchibo acquired Scotland based roasting company Matthew Algie. Corporate structure Tchibo is owned by Maxingvest AG, which changed its name from Tchibo Holding AG in 2007. It is 100% owned by three members of the Herz family, Ingeburg Herz (Max Herz's widow), and two of her sons, Michael Herz and Wolfgang Herz. In 2003, they bought out their brother, Gunter, and sister, Daniela Herz-Schnoekel. Their brother Joachim died in a motorboat accident in 2008. Maxingvest AG is the largest shareholder of the listed company Beiersdorf. In 2002, Tchibo held 850 shops and 22,000 so-called Frische-Depots in bread shops and supermarkets, where shelves bearing the company's \\"brand\\" sell packaged coffee (with customer-operated coffee grinders provided in some locations) alongside non-food articles such as clothes and accessories, as well as sporting and household goods.

The school provided a Fundamentalist Christian education to students in grades K‚Äì12. The Academy, better known as \\"CCA\\" by its students, was founded in 1974 as a ministry of Limerick Chapel, and as a part of the Christian School movement. Parents were encouraged to remove their children from the public school system due to lack of Biblical influence in the public school curriculum. The Academy was based on the Bible being the inerrant word of God; creationism was the basis of all scientific teaching at the school. The school began with grades 1‚Äì6 and each year added a grade. In 1981, the academy had its first graduating class. Graduates from Chapel Christian Academy were encouraged to attend Fundamentalist Christian colleges such as Bob Jones University, Pensacola Christian College, also primarily encouraging studies in Teaching, Missions, and Music. The Academy had three major divisions: Elementary (K‚Äì6), Junior High (7‚Äì8), and High School (9‚Äì12). Chapel Christian Academy was a member of the Keystone Christian Education Association and well known for always placing highly in the annual KCEA State Competition. The school thrived with a strong Senior High Choir, Junior High Choir, and eventually four levels of Handbell Choirs. The Academy students were viewed by their local Christian school peers as one of the higher levels of KCEA State Competition to compete against. Chapel sports consisted of basketball, soccer, baseball (boys), and volleyball (girls). The school mascot was the Cougar, and a beautiful lifelike depiction was painted on the gym wall. Financial problems plagued the church and school for years creating a division that caused a large number of parents and students to leave due to the disagreement which then caused the decision to close the Academy. The Academy resorted to a mainly computer-taught system in the 2006‚Äì2007 school year and finally closed its doors at the close of that school year.

His 1932 book Memoirs of a British Agent became an international bestseller and brought him to the world's attention by telling of his failed effort to sabotage the Bolshevik Revolution in Moscow in 1918. His co- conspirators were double agents working for the Bolsheviks. In the end, the \\"Lockhart Plot\\" was revealed as a cunning sting operation controlled by Felix Dzerzhinsky with the goal of discrediting the British and French governments.Richard K. Debo, \\"Lockhart Plot or Dzerhinskii Plot?\\" Journal of Modern History 43.3 (1971): 413‚Äì439.John W. Long, \\"Plot and counter-plot in revolutionary Russia: Chronicling the Bruce Lockhart conspiracy, 1918.\\" Intelligence and National Security 10.1 (1995): 122-143. Background He was born in Anstruther, Fife, the son of Robert Bruce Lockhart, the first headmaster of Spier's School, Beith, Ayrshire, Scotland. His mother was Florence Stuart Macgregor, while his other ancestors include Bruces, Hamiltons, Cummings, Wallaces and Douglases. He claimed that he could trace a connection back to Boswell of Auchinleck. In Memoirs of a British Agent, he wrote, \\"There is no drop of English blood in my veins.\\" He attended Fettes College, in Edinburgh. His family were mostly schoolmasters, but his younger brother, Sir Robert McGregor MacDonald Lockhart, became an Indian Army general. On 15 August 1947, the day British India was partitioned into two independent Dominions of India and Pakistan, he was appointed as the last Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army. His brother John Bruce Lockhart was the headmaster of Sedbergh School, and his nephews Rab Bruce Lockhart and Logie Bruce Lockhart went on to become headmasters of Loretto and Gresham's. His great-nephew, Simon Bruce-Lockhart, was the headmaster of Glenlyon Norfolk School. (and other linked pages) Career =Malaya= At 21, Lockhart went out to Malaya to join two uncles who were rubber planters there. According to his own account, he was sent to open up a new rubber estate near Pantai in Negeri Sembilan, in a district in which \\"there were no other white men\\". He then \\"caused a minor sensation by carrying off Amai, the beautiful ward of the Dato' Klana, the local Malay prince... my first romance\\". However, three years in Malaya, and one with Amai, came to an end when \\"doctors pronounced Malaria, but there were many people who said that I had been poisoned\\". One of his uncles and one of his cousins \\"bundled my emaciated body into a motor car and... packed me off home via Japan and America\\". The Dato' Klana in question was the chief of Sungei Ujong, the most important of the Nine States of Negeri Sembilan, whose palace was at Ampangan.Bruce Lockhart, R. H., Return to Malaya (London: Putnam), 1936, pp. 4‚Äì5, 195, 211 & 230 =First Moscow posting= Lockhart next joined the British Foreign Service and was posted to Moscow as Vice-Consul. At the time of his arrival in Russia, people had heard that a great footballer named Lockhart from Cambridge was arriving, and he was invited to turn out for Morozov a textile factory team that played their games 30 miles east of Moscow. The manager of the cotton mill was from Lancashire, England. Lockhart played for most of the 1912 season, and his team won the Moscow league championship that year. The gold medal that he won is in the collection of the National Library of Scotland. The great player, however, was Bruce's brother, John, who had played rugby union for Scotland, and by his own admission, Bruce barely deserved his place in the team and played simply for the love of the sport. He was British Consul-General in Moscow when the February Revolution broke out in early 1917 but left shortly before the Bolshevik Revolution later that year. =Return to Moscow= In January 1918, at the behest of the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Lord Milner, the Secretary of State for War, Lockhart returned to Russia as the United Kingdom's first envoy to Bolshevik Russia, in an attempt to counteract German influence. Moura Budberg, the wife of a high-ranking Czarist diplomat, Count Johann von Benckendorff, became his mistress.Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, Memoirs of a British Agent; first published 1932 by Macmillan (January 1975); / After his return, Lockhart also worked for the Secret Intelligence Service, having been given ¬£648 worth of diamonds to fund the creation of an agent network in Russia. Later, Lockhart spoke out for the suspected Bolshevisk spy Arthur Ransome, saying he had been a valuable intelligence asset amid the worst chaos of the revolution. As the chaos worsened in Russia and purges took hold among the Bolshevik leaders, Lockhart helped Trotsky's secretary, Evgenia Petrovna Shelepina, to leave Russia; she later married Ransome. =Arrest and imprisonment= In 1918, Lockhart and fellow British agent Sidney Reilly were alleged to have plotted to assassinate Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin. Lockhart and British officials condemned that as Soviet propaganda. He was accused of plotting against the Bolshevik regime and, for a time during 1918, was confined in the Kremlin as a prisoner and feared being condemned to death. However, he escaped trial in an exchange of secret agents for the Russian diplomat Maksim Maksimovich Litvinov. He later wrote about his experiences in his 1932 autobiographical book, Memoirs of a British Agent, which became an instant worldwide hit and was made into the 1934 film, British Agent, by Warner Brothers. Lockhart was tried in absentia before the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal in a proceeding, which opened 25 November 1918.Robert Service, Spies and Commissars: Bolshevik Russia and the West. London: Macmillan, 2011; pg. 164. Some 20 defendants faced charges in the trial, most of whom had worked for the Americans or the British in Moscow, in the case levied by procurator Nikolai Krylenko. The case concluded on 3 December 1918, with two defendants sentenced to be shot and various others sentenced to terms of prison or forced labour for terms up to five years.Service, Spies and Commissars, pp. 164-165. Lockhart and Reilly were both sentenced to death in absentia, with the sentence to be executed if they were ever found in Soviet Russia again.Service, Spies and Commissars, pg. 165. = Finance = Lockhart was appointed the commercial secretary of the British legation in Prague in November 1919. In 1922, finding the work boring, he left the post and moved into finance. He joined a Central European Bank that was run by the Bank of England. = Journalism = In 1928, Lockhart left the world of finance and moved into journalism, joining Lord Beaverbook's Evening Standard. He served as the editor of the paper's Londoner's Diary column and was then known for his hard-drinking and semi-debauched lifestyle. It enhanced his reputation that despite having been caught by the Russians and exchanged for a Soviet agent, he remained on unusually cordial terms with the Soviet Embassy in London from whom he received an annual gift of caviar.Roger Wilkes, Scandal: A Scurrilous History of Gossip (2002), p. 162 He also helped to organise Beaverbrook's Empire Free Trade Crusade campaign. In the 1930s, Lockhart also began to release a number of books, which were successful enough that writing became his full-time career in 1937. =Later life= During the Second World War, Lockhart became director-general of the Political Warfare Executive, co- ordinating all British propaganda against the Axis powers. He was also for a time the British liaison officer to the Czechoslovak government-in-exile under President Edvard Bene≈°. After the war, he resumed writing, lecturing and broadcasting and made a weekly BBC Radio broadcast to Czechoslovakia for over ten years. Personal life In 1913, Lockhart married firstly Jean Bruce Haslewood, and they had a son, the author Robin Bruce Lockhart, who wrote the book Ace of Spies (1967) ‚Äì about his father's friend and fellow agent Sidney Reilly ‚Äì from which the television serial Reilly, Ace of Spies (1983) was later produced. In 1948, Lockhart married his second wife Frances Mary Beck. His diaries, published after his death, reveal that he struggled for most of his life with alcoholism.Phillip Knightley, The Second Oldest Profession (New York: Norton, 1986), p. 73 Death and legacy Lockhart died on 27 February 1970, at the age of 82, and left property valued at ¬£2054. His address at death was Brookside, Ditchling, Sussex.\\"Bruce-Lockhart sir Robert Hamilton\\" in Probate Index for 1970, online at probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar, accessed 12 April 2019 The 1983 British television series Reilly, Ace of Spies, was based on a book by his son.

During this championship, Boll declined to compete in doubles and team matches, focussing instead on the singles competition. Playing for the German national team, Boll received silver medals at both the Team World Championships 2010 in Moscow and the 2012 championships in Dortmund, losing out both times to the Chinese team. = Knee Injury and Comeback (2015-2016) = Boll kept his good form at the Chinese Super League in 2015, obtaining a result of 7 wins and 5 losses. Due to a knee injury, Boll opted for an operation to pre-empt a more serious injury. The surgery kept him out of action for an extended period of time. After resting from the surgery, Boll qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics. At the Olympic Singles event, Boll lost against Quadri Aruna in the round of 32. At the Team event, Boll along with partners Bastian Steger and Dimitrij Ovtcharov won the bronze medal at the team event. = Continued Success (2017-) = Boll also won the silver medal at the 2017 World Cup, defeating Lin Gaoyuan in the quarterfinals, Ma Long in the semifinals but losing to fellow teammate Dimitrij Ovtcharov in the finals. He won the silver medal in the following World Cup in 2018, losing to Fan Zhendong in the finals. Boll won another eight titles at the European Table Tennis Championships in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2018. Technique Timo Boll is a left-handed player whose best weapon is his forehand topspin drive but is also noted for his extremely quick backhand loop. His blade is the \\"Timo Boll ALC\\" with Dignics 09c rubbers on both sides. His present doubles partner is Patrick Franziska. Boll's technique was ahead of its time as he was one of the first two-winged loopers. He employs the spin-block instead of a passive block to put more pressure on his opponents. He is renowned for being one of the top players when it comes to generating elevated amounts of spin, especially in his opening topspin. This is rendered possible by his low stance, quick acceleration and use of the wrist. This technique brought him a lot of success due to his opponents being put under pressure during the celluloid ball era. In recent years, due to the introduction of the plastic ball, which cannot be imparted with as much spin, Boll relies more on his counter-topspin technique from both the backhand and forehand side. A good example of him employing this technique is his match against Fan Zhendong at the Austrian Open in 2019, in which he reached the deciding set against the 16 years younger World No. 1. This technique allows him to conserve energy but requires very good anticipation and reading of the opponent. Club history Timo Boll has played for TSV H√∂chst (1986 to 1994), FTG Frankfurt (1994 to 1995) and for TTV G√∂nnern (1995 to 2007). On July 1, 2007, his three-year contract began with Borussia D√ºsseldorf. Personal life Timo Boll married his longtime girlfriend, Rodelia Jacobi, on December 31, 2002. They have a daughter, Zoey Malaya, born Dec 4, 2013.

She was the second battleship built domestically in Japan and the first to use steam turbines for propulsion. The ship was named for Aki Province,Silverstone, p. 325 now a part of Hiroshima Prefecture. The ship saw no combat during World War I. Aki was disarmed in 1922 and sunk as a target in 1924 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Background The Satsuma class was ordered in late 1904 under the 1904 War Naval Supplementary Program during the Russo-Japanese War.Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 53 Unlike the previous pre-dreadnought battleships, they were the first battleships ordered from Japanese shipyards.Evans & Peattie, p. 159 They were originally designed with a dozen guns, but had to be redesigned because of a shortage of guns in Japan and to reduce costs. Design and description The ship had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draft of . She displaced at normal load. The crew consisted of 931 officers and enlisted men.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 23 Aki was fitted with a pair of Curtiss steam turbine sets, each driving one shaft using steam from 15 Miyabara water- tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of for a design speed of . The ship reached a top speed of during her sea trials from .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, pp. 23‚Äì24 She carried enough coal and oil to give her a range of at a speed of . Unlike her half-sister, she had three funnels.Preston, p. 195 The ship's main battery consisted of four 45-caliber 12-inch (305 mm) 41st Year Type guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure. Her intermediate armament consisted of six twin-gun turrets equipped with 45-caliber Type 41 10-inch (254 mm) guns, three turrets on each side of the superstructure. Her heavy intermediate armament of guns larger than is why the ship is considered to be a semi-dreadnought. Akis secondary armament consisted of eight 45-caliber 6-inch (152 mm) 41st Year Type guns, mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull. The ship was also equipped with eight quick-firing (QF) 40-caliber 12-pounder () 12-cwt guns\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. and four 28-caliber 12-pounder QF guns. In addition, the battleship was fitted with five submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside and one in the stern. The waterline main belt of the Satsuma-class vessels consisted of Krupp cemented armor that had a maximum thickness of nine inches amidships. It tapered to a thickness of at the ends of the ship. A six-inch strake of armor protected the casemates. The barbettes for the main guns were thick. The armor of Akis main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of . The deck armor was thick and the conning tower was protected by six inches of armor.Gardiner & Gray, p. 238 Construction and service Aki was laid down at Kure Naval Arsenal on 15 March 1906. She was launched on 15 April 1907, but construction was suspended for about five months after the decision was made on 26 November to install steam turbines on Aki and the armored cruiser . Akis turbines were already behind schedule and the suspension allowed the less valuable ship to be completed first, and changes made to its turbines after testing were also incorporated into Akis turbines.Itani, Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 60 and footnote 19, p. 79 Aki was finally completed on 11 March 1911 and her first captain was Tatsuo Matsumura. When World War I began in August 1914, Aki was refitting at Kure Naval Arsenal. She was assigned to the 1st Battleship Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918, seeing no combat during the war. From December 1915 to December 1916, she was commanded by Captain Kiyokazu Abo. The ship was disarmed at Yokosuka in 1922 to comply with the provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty, stricken from the navy list during 1923 and converted into a target ship. Her guns were turned over to the Imperial Japanese Army for use as coastal artillery. The rest of her guns were placed in reserve and ultimately scrapped in 1943.Gibbs & Tamura, pp. 192, 194 Two of her 10-inch gun turrets were installed as coastal artillery batteries on J≈çgashima island to protect Tokyo Bay.

He was an anti-colonial revolutionary and orchestrated rebellions against the Cape Colony government. The Galeshewe Township in the Sol Plaatje Municipality, Kimberley, has been named after him. A South African Navy fast attack craft has also named after him. Galeshewe was born in 1835 near Taung, South Africa.  Revolutionary activity  After diamonds were famously discovered in Kimberley in the mid 1800s, colonists from the Cape Colony began to move into the interior in search of opportunities at the soon to become profitable diamond mines. The settler colonies (mostly British) moving into the interior closer to the extraction plains came into direct conflict with many indigenous people living near the Orange River. By the 1870s the second Diamond rush was underway. A rebellion led by Galeshewe broke out against the Cape Colony government on 18 July 1878 at Cornforth Hill, Kimberley, after a decision was made to cull the rural cattle population in order to combat a Rinderpest epidemic. More than 17 cattle that belonged to the Batlhaping people had strayed out of their reserve and into a white farmer's plot of land. The farmer shot all of them citing his fears over rinderpest spreading to his own livestock. The matter was taken to court, with Galeshewe's cousin Petlhu demanding compensation, but the magistrate ruled in favour of the farmer as straying cattle was strictly prohibited. No compensation was given.Mathews, Gary (2011). \\"The Last Stand of a South African hero\\". Mahala. Accessed: 31 August 2018 It became known as the Phokwane Rebellion. As cattle was used as currency by the majority of local groups, this decision by the colonial government sparked outrage. While Galeshewe was in the Transvaal trying to get support from the Boers against the actions of the British, leaders of the Phokwane Reserve refused to allow police officials on the reserve to investigate what happened with the cattle. The Cape government considered this an act of rebellion. Galeshewe joined forces with the Tlharo and the Rolong groups, where skirmishes were led against colonial traders and farmers in retribution against the cattle culling. The rebellion resulted in Galeshewe's capture by Colonel C Warren's troops on 26 August 1878. On 6 October 1879, Galeshewe was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his part in the uprising. Once he had completed his sentence, Galeshewe amassed forces with neighbouring groups in the Langeberg Rebellion where he was captured again and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After a month in prison, Galeshewe escaped but was captured once more a month later and imprisoned. When Galeshewe escaped, he and the leader of the Batlhaping, Luka Jantjie, were attacked by the Cape Colonial Force that was 2000 men strong. It is said the colonial troops carried with them 7 and 12 pounder artillery along with Maxim machine guns.Lunderstedt, Steve (2016). \\"Today in Kimberley's History\\". Kimberley City Info. Accessed: 31 August 2018 Galeshewe was ambushed in Langeberg by the Cape Colonial Force, who were the under the charge of Colonel Edmund Dalgety, a commander of the Cape Mounted Rifles. Galeshewe managed to escape, even though five of his men were shot and killed. He set north towards Bechuanaland (modern-day Botswana). A search party led by George Dennison took off from Vryburg in the Orange Free State, who's instructions were to incept Galeshewe before he crossed into Bechuanaland. Prison photographs of Kgosi Galeshewe, 1898 Dennison and his army of farmers travelled along the Molopo River for the good part of three weeks, patrolling the area and taking prisoner any local Batswana that may have had key information regarding Galeshewe's movements (2). It is reported that Galeshewe was travelling with his uncle Morebonoke, his brothers Mootametsi, Telekela and Mogodi. On 26 August 1897 Galeshewe was tracked down and surrounded by Dennison and his search party. He then served a 10-year sentence in prison on Robben Island. In 1898, the Batlhaping lost their land in Phokwane, as well as Galeshewe's farms which were confiscated by the Cape Colony government in response to Galeshewe's actions. The Batlhaping were then forced to settle at Magogong where they were placed under the chieftaincy of Molale. Some of his people were executed for participating in the rebellion while some were moved to the Cape Colony as free labour. Luka Jantjie was shot in the chest and killed instantly after a brief gun battle with the Cape Colonial Force. A surgeon was commissioned to cut his head off and boil it. Galeshewe died at Magogong, north of Hartswater, in 1924.

He himself describes his songs as ¬ªmelancholy pop hymns¬´. Hecker grew up in Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia. He learned to play the piano, the drums and the guitar and did his A levels at Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gymnasium in B√ºnde in 1997. Having finished his alternative civilian service at Klinikum Schwabing in Munich, he started training in nursing practice at the hospital Charit√© in Berlin in 1999.  Career  Apart from his activities as a trainee nurse, Hecker continued pursuing his musical hobby busking in the area of Hackescher Markt in Berlin-Mitte. Thus he came in contact with Berlin's music- and cultural scene. In 2000, the demo of his song Cold Wind Blowing was used for the score of German director Esther Gronenborn's movie Alaska.de. Soon after that, the Berlin-based record company Kitty-yo, having released the movie's soundtrack, offered Hecker a record deal. =Infinite Love Songs= In October 2001, Hecker released his debut album Infinite Love Songs, produced in cooperation with German producer Tommi Eckart. The album was critically acclaimed worldwide and even reached the top ten list of The New York Times‚Äô album of the year contest in 2001. Hence, Hecker's debut was to be found amongst albums of Bob Dylan, The White Stripes and Alicia Keys. Critic Neil Strauss writes: ¬ªIn a long list of precious, fragile, heartbroken artists to emerge in the last two years (Tom McRae, Ed Harcourt, the Kingsbury Manx), Mr. Hecker, by legend an oft-disparaged Berlin street musician, whispers the most precious and fragile heartbreak of them all.¬´The New York Times, 2001-12-23, Neil Strauss, The Year in Classical Music: The Critics' Choices; Blues and 60's Rock; Classy, Slick Soul From October 2001 to February 2002, Hecker went on his first European tour ‚Äì at that time solo, with electric guitar, keyboard and groovebox ‚Äì, as a headliner mostly, but also as an opening act for Bill Callahan, the Walkabouts and others. Around that time, his song Polyester became a hit in Israeli mainstream radio and was considered a peace anthem. In April and May 2002, Hecker opened for Lloyd Cole on his tour of France. =Rose= In May 2003, Hecker put out his second studio album Rose, produced by British producer Gareth Jones, who had previously worked with Depeche Mode and Erasure. In particular the British press praised the record.Nigel Williamson from British music magazine Uncut about Rose in July 2003: ¬ªGiven the romantic movement began in Germany, it's odd that the country is today known for electronic experimentalism rather than emotional warmth. Maximilian Hecker's name may not belong in the same breath as Beethoven or Go√´the. But he seeks to readjust the balance with his second album of frail, elegiac hymns of unrequited love. That the opening track is called \\"Kate Moss\\" is unpromising. Yet even that turns out to be another exquisite paean to heartbreak. Not as dark or deep as Ed Harcourt. But fans of From Every Sphere should definitely give Max a listen.¬´ Dan Martin from British music magazine New Musical Express writes: ¬ªIn the first three minutes, a lovelorn Hecker bemoans how he‚Äôs spent seven days without a glance from Kate Moss. But if the former busker has something of the stalker about him, he‚Äôs not one of those men who have bad fringes and still live with their mum. \\"Rose\\", Hecker's second LP, is as beautiful and barbed as the flower itself and proves that sinister can also be suave and beautiful. While his sexless Germanic vocals threaten to get smothered in drippy melancholy, he‚Äôs wise enough to ease off with the string quartets as things progress, transmuting his snail pace into the kind of pin- drop quiet electro Fischerspooner would make after a pint of heroin. Lovely.¬´New Musical Express, 2003-05-03, Dan Martin Then Neil Tennant from Pet Shop Boys, having taken notice of Hecker, started to communicate Hecker's music to others on his website. In May and June 2003, soon after releasing Rose, Hecker went on his second European tour, followed by his third one in September and October of the same year, opening for Cat Power in Clermont- Ferrand, France, and this time supported by live musicians Jens Friebe on keyboard, Hans Narva on bass and Chris Imler on drums. Maximilian Hecker & Band at ¬ªSESC Pomp√©ia¬´ in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, October 28, 2003 In September 2003, South Korean record company Pastel Music released Hecker's first two albums in South Korea, and from October 2003 to March 2004, Hecker and German musician Barbara Morgenstern were sent on a worldwide tour through 34 cities by German cultural institution Goethe-Institut. =Lady Sleep= In January 2005, Hecker released his third studio album Lady Sleep (produced by Israelite, Berlin- based producer Guy Sternberg) in Europe and later that year in South Korea. In January and February, he went on his fourth tour of Europe, supported by Johannes Feige on electric guitar, Philipp Neumann on bass and Snorre Schwarz respectively Nicolai Ziel on drums. Jim Butler of BBC Collective about Lady Sleep: ¬ªOn 'Lady Sleep', his third album, the criminally underrated Maximilian Hecker returns to his recurring fascination with affairs of the heart. Although simpler (ie, less electronic) than his last album, 'Rose', 'Lady Sleep' is just as evocative: opulent orchestral symphonies sway with a shimmering elegance, the neo-Baroque chamber pop hints at stunning torch songs for the 21st Century and Hecker‚Äôs softly spoken vocals are gently affecting. Less camp than Antony And The Johnsons, although just as grand, Berliner Hecker, in anyone‚Äôs language, deserves to be a star.¬´BBC Collective, 2005-04-01, Jim Butler In July 2005, Hecker was invited to Seoul, South Korea, to play two gigs, and in June 2006, he was sent to Taipei, Taiwan, to give two concerts, after the Taiwanese record company Avant Garden Records had released his first three albums in Taiwan in August 2005. =I'll Be a Virgin, I'll Be a Mountain= In summer 2006 he changed from Kitty-yo to V2 Records and released his fourth studio album, I'll Be a Virgin, I'll Be a Mountain (again produced by Guy Sternberg) in Europe, South Korea and Taiwan in September 2006. Unlike his three predecessors, which Hecker had recorded on his own for the most part, the album was brought about with the aid of a number of studio musicians, amongst them Snorre Schwarz, Hecker's live drummer. Sharon O‚ÄôConnell from British music magazine Uncut reviewed I'll Be a Virgin, I'll Be a Mountain in the magazine's December issue 2006: ¬ªComparing Hecker to Chris Martin may be something of a backhanded compliment, but it‚Äôs an indication of the 29-year-old‚Äôs potential reach, rather than an indictment of aesthetic weediness. That said, \\"I‚Äôll Be A Virgin‚Ä¶\\" is a hushed introspective affair, its sweetly mournful melodies augmented by tasteful string arrangements and carrying somewhat poetically strained lyrics (\\"Wilted Flower\\" distinguishes itself on that count). Toward the album‚Äôs close, a dreary sameness sets in; simpler songs like the folky \\"Messed-up Girl\\" are Hecker‚Äôs most effective.¬´ In October and November 2006, Hecker went on his fifth European tour, followed by concerts in Taipei and Seoul in November and December of the same year, and finally by him opening for Irish musician Duke Special on his tour of Europe in March 2007. Around that time, Hecker's song Dying was chosen as background music for a commercial of electronics group Samsung, broadcast in South Korea and China. Maximilian Hecker & Band at ¬ªKon Kook University Millennium Hall¬´ in Seoul, South Korea, July 13th 2007Maximilian Hecker signing autographs after a concert in Guangzhou, China, November 2008 In early 2007, Hecker recorded an EP, entitled Once I Was, especially for the East Asian market. The record contains cover versions only, and was released, along with a best-of- compilation of his songs, in Taiwan, South Korea, and for the first time in Mainland China (there entitled I Am Falling Now) in May respectively June that year. The album offered the opportunity to send Hecker on his fifth tour of Asia, leading him through Taiwan, South Korea and Mainland China in July of the same year. In November 2007, Hecker's former record label Kitty-yo released the live album Live Radio Sessions as a digital release, the majority of its titles recordings of a concert that Hecker had given at Radio Bremen on March 2, 2005. =One Day= In May 2008, he made a flying visit to Mainland China and Hong Kong, and in autumn of the same year, he released his fifth studio album One Day in South Korea, Taiwan, Mainland China and, for the first time, in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore (on Hong Kong based record label Love Da Records). The record had again been produced by Guy Sternberg and had come into being with the participation of Hecker's live band. The release was followed by his seventh Asian tour, leading Hecker through South Korea, Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In the meantime, Hecker had started to write songs for other musicians, and his song ¬ªMiss Underwater¬´ was chosen the first single of Taiwanese singer Faith Yang's album Self-Selected in April 2009. At the same time, the fast food chain Dunkin' Donuts took Hecker's song Silly Lily, Funny Bunny as background music for one of their commercials broadcast in South Korea. In April/May 2009, One Day was released in Europe on Berlin based record label Louisville Records respectively on Roadrunner Records, followed by Hecker's seventh tour of Europe in May and June 2009. Cracked Webzine about One Day in April 2009: ¬ªSo, after all and taking all of the above into account, Hecker might be headed into a completely different direction and is straight on the way to become the James Taylor of the digital age. Nothing bad about that, actually, I like the first Taylor-albums as much as anybody (and also Carole King, Rickie Lee Jones, Joni Mitchell or Bill Withers, to be honest) and after all he has penned a few songs that will stay in the canon of modern songwriting for ever without ever becoming kitschy or pathetic. Which in itself is basically more than 99.9 % of all songwriters of the last five years have done. I cannot say which of the songs on ‚ÄúOne Day‚Äù, if any, will ever reach that status, because that is for the next decades to show.¬´Cracked webzine, April 2009 In October and November 2009, Hecker went on his eighth Asian tour through Taiwan, South Korea and Mainland China. Inspired by a solo performance in the context of the concert series FM4 Radio Sessions at Radiokulturhaus in Vienna, Austria, on March 26th, 2009, Hecker returned to performing his concerts solo, without live musicians, preferably on a grand piano. =I Am Nothing But Emotion, No Human Being, No Son, Never Again Son= In January, Hecker established his own record label Blue Soldier Records, where, in March (respectively May) of the same year, he released his sixth studio album in Europe: I Am Nothing But Emotion, No Human Being, No Son, Never Again Son. This record, accomplished without producer or studio musicians, and, like his debut Infinite Love Songs mainly a home recording, portrayed a return to Hecker's roots. In the course of the year, I Am Nothing But Emotion, No Human Being, No Son, Never Again Son was released in South Korea, Taiwan (by this time on Gold Typhoon Music), Mainland China, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. Erin Lyndal Martin reviewed the album for PopMatters in May 2010: Maximilian Hecker and Rachael Yamagata at ¬ªSejong Cultural Center¬´ in Seoul, South Korea, January 23rd 2011 ¬ªPerhaps the most startling, out of character moment is on the opening track, ‚ÄúBlue Soldier Night‚Äù, which is delivered in a robotic female voice. This is nothing new, but it shows some levity that one wouldn‚Äôt expect from Hecker. Paradoxically, the song becomes that much more moving for that aspect, especially when the robot delivers the title line, ‚ÄúI am nothing but emotion‚Äù, which would sound simply insipid had it been delivered by Hecker. When the formula works, it really works. The simply beautiful ‚ÄúGlaslights‚Äù is evidence of this, with its ambient piano and quiet vocals. There are some nice touches here as well, such as the sound of the piano pedals rising and falling, lending an intimate immediacy to the song. ‚ÄúThere are angels in the glaslights‚Äù, Hecker sings soothingly. ‚ÄúThe Greatest Love of All‚Äù (not a Whitney Houston cover‚Äîpromise!) features quiet acoustic guitar arpeggios that augment the piano. On an album this piano- heavy, the guitar is a nice touch. Unfortunately, this is one of three songs that rely on angel imagery in order to survive. While one could claim this is a concept album about angels, that would still be a trite concept for any album that‚Äôs not contemporary Christian (and even then, it‚Äôd be a little dicey). ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Come Home Again‚Äù is a highlight because of its perfect melody. Hecker displays less vocal monotony here than his usual, one-note-albeit- heartfelt one.¬´PopMatters, May 2010, Erin Lyndal Martin In April and May 2010, Hecker played the first part of an extensive Chinese tour of 24 Chinese cities ‚Äì he accomplished the second part in the autumn of the same year ‚Äì, and his song Kun Zai, written along with Sodagreen singer Wu Qingfeng, was released as the first single of Taiwanese singer Wei Ruxuan's album Graceful Porcupine in Taiwan and Mainland China. In the course of his current release, Hecker went on a tour of Germany in June of the same year. In November 2010, he released the two albums Favourite Demos and Rare and Unreleased digitally. These albums contain the demos of 27 songs from his first five albums, as well as twelve B-sides and other songs unreleased up to then. On January 23, 2011, Hecker gave a joint concert, along with American musician Rachael Yamagata at Sejong Cultural Center in Seoul, South Korea, and in autumn of the same year, he played his 8th Chinese tour ‚Äì that took him to Shanghai, Shenyang, Beijing, Hangzhou and Foshan. =Mirage of Bliss= Then, in July/August/October 2012, he released his seventh studio album Mirage of Bliss in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the UK, Ireland, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Italy, Japan and the USA, again on his own record label Blue Soldier Records, and in autumn of the same year, the album was released in Mainland China (by this time on Gold Typhoon Music), Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea (by this time on Leeway). On the album, produced by British producer Martin Glover a.k.a. Youth, who had previously worked with Paul McCartney, The Verve and Embrace, Hecker once more plays all instruments, except for the bass guitar which is contributed by Glover. With its lush Britpop sound, Mirage Of Bliss could be regarded as the opposite of its rough sounding predecessor I Am Nothing But Emotion, No Human Being, No Son, Never Again Son. =The Rise and Fall of Maximilian Hecker= In August of the same year, German publishing house Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf published Hecker's debut as a writer, the autobiographical book The Rise and Fall of Maximilian Hecker (written in German) in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The very candid text deals with Hecker's career as a musician and his life between two worlds, Europe and Asia, and is an \\"intimate document of a self-discovery\\" (blurb). The first part of Hecker‚Äôs tour promoting Mirage of Bliss took him to Taiwan and Mainland China in October and November 2012, the second part, in the context of which he played six concerts at Chinese concert halls as well as at ¬ªSeoul Jazz Festival¬´, followed in May 2013. From December 2012 to April 2013, Hecker played an extensive European tour, for the most part together with Polarkreis 18 singer Felix R√§uber, before returning to China to play concerts in Shenzhen, Chengdu and Shanghai in September 2014. =Spellbound Scenes of My Cure= In January 2015, Maximilian Hecker released his eight studio album Spellbound Scenes of My Cure in Europe (Eat The Beat Music), Mainland China (Beijing Dragon Flying Culture Media), Taiwan (Avant Garden Records) and South Korea (Leeway). Spellbound Scenes of My Cure, which was produced by Johannes Feige and Hecker himself and was mixed by Tommi Eckart, could be regarded as a concept album, since it deals exclusively with places on earth that Hecker has traveled to. The release was accompanied by impressionist, self- filmed video films artist's homepage that Hecker had shot in the context of these travels. = The Best of Maximilian Hecker = Following a solo German concert tour in January 2015 and an East Asian one (China, Taiwan and South Korea) in spring of the same year, this time as a duo, with Johannes Feige contributing electric guitar and harmony vocals, Hecker, who had been active for 15 years at this point, released a retrospective of 30 songs, The Best of Maximilian Hecker, in Europe (Eat The Beat Music), Mainland China (Want U Music), Taiwan (Hinote) and South Korea (Leeway) in spring 2016. Between April and July of the same year, his Best of Maximilian Hecker-tour took him and his live musicians Johannes Feige and Nicolai Ziel again to China, Taiwan and South Korea, followed by another Mainland Chinese tour, titled Fancy April in April 2017. Between September 2017 and July 2018, Hecker took part as a live musician in the stage play Wie kann ich dich finden, zu mir ziehen und √ºberreden zu bleiben (written by Anja Hilling and directed by Friederike Heller) at Mannheim National Theatre, for which he had also composed the songs and the score music. = Wretched Love Songs = In April and May 2018, Hecker released his ninth studio album Wretched Love Songs in Europe (Eat The Beat Music), Mainland China (Want U Music), Taiwan (Hinote) and South Korea (Leeway). The album was recorded and produced in the same fashion as his predecessor, Spellbound Scenes of My Cure, together with Johannes Feige (arrangement and production) und Tommi Eckart (mix). The East Asian tour to promote Wretched Love Songs (17 concerts in Mainland China and two in Seoul, South Korea) took place in April and May of the same year, and the German tour followed in January 2019.

He asserted that the principle of motion was the separation of hot from cold, from which he endeavoured to explain the formation of the Earth and the creation of animals and humans. Life Archelaus was a philosopher of the Ionian School, called Physicus from having been the first to teach natural philosophy at Athens. This statement of Diogenes La√´rtius, is contradicted by Clement of Alexandria,Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, i. but the two may be reconciled by supposing that Archelaus was the first Athenian who did so. According to Simplicius,Simplicius, in Phys. Aristot. fol. 6, b. who probably got his information from Theophrastus, Archelaus was a native of Athens, even though Diogenes La√´rtius says he was born in Miletus. He was the son of Apollodorus, or as some say, of Mydon, Midon,Suda, Archelaos or Myson; was a pupil of Anaxagoras; and is said to have taught at Lampsacus before he established himself at Athens. He is commonly reported to have taught Socrates and Euripides. If he was the instructor of Socrates, he is never mentioned by Xenophon, Plato, or Aristotle, and this story may have been an attempt to connect Socrates with the Ionian School. However, Diogenes La√´rtius does report, on the authority of Ion of Chios, a contemporary of Socrates, that Socrates went with Archelaus on a trip to Samos.Diogenes La√´rtius, ii. 23 Also, some scholars have seen in Socrates' \\"autobiographical\\" sketch in Plato's PhaedoPlato, Phaedo, 96b a reference to Archelaus' theory about the generation and nourishment of the first animals.John Burnet 1911, Plato: Phaedo, p. 100. The tradition which connects Archelaus with Euripides may have arisen from a confusion with Euripides' patron, Archelaus, king of Macedonia. Philosophy No fragments of Archelaus have survived; his doctrines have to be extracted from Diogenes La√´rtius, Simplicius, Pseudo-Plutarch, and Hippolytus. Archelaus held that air and infinity are the principle of all things, by which Pseudo-PlutarchPseudo-Plutarch, Plac. Phil. i. 3. supposes that he meant infinite air; and we are told, that by this statement he intended to exclude Mind from the creation of the world.Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. i. 1, 2. If so, he abandoned the doctrine of Anaxagoras at its most important point; and it seems safer to conclude that while he wished to teach the materialist notion that the mind is formed of air, he still held infinite Mind to be the cause of all things. This explanation has the advantage of agreeing with Simplicius. Beginning with primitive Matter, (identical with air mingled with Mind), by a process of thickening and thinning, arose cold and warmth, or water and fire, the one passive, the other active. Archelaus deduced motion from the opposition of heat and cold, caused by the will of the material Mind. This opposition separated fire and water, and produced a slimy mass of earth. While the earth was hardening, the action of heat upon its moisture gave birth to animals, which at first were nourished by the mud from which they sprang, and gradually acquired the power of propagating their species. Humans also appear, at first in lower forms. All these animals were endowed with mind, but humans separated from the others, and established laws and societies. It was just from this point of his physical theory that he seems to have passed into ethical speculation, by the proposition, that right and wrong are \\"not by nature but by custom\\" ()‚Äîdogma possibly suggested to him by the contemporary Sophists. Of the other doctrines of Archelaus, he asserted that the Earth was flat, but that the surface must be depressed towards the centre; for if it were absolutely level, the sun would rise and set everywhere at the same time. He also said that the Sun was the largest of the stars. He accounted for speech by the motion of the air; for this, he seems to have adopted the views of Anaxagoras.Pseudo-Plutarch, Plac. Phil. iv. 19.

It consists of two areas separated by Six Dials junction. The northern section of the district is bounded by St Mary's Road and some streets to the west and the area to the east is Nicholstown-Newtown. The northern section is home to the fire station. The majority of St Mary's is in the southern portion, to the east of St Mary Street. This is where St Mary's church is located, from which the suburb's name originates. The southern section is also home to the Golden Grove area. It is bordered on the east by the rail lines (the other side of these lines is the district of Chapel). It gives its name to St Mary's Stadium, where Southampton Football Club play, although the stadium itself is in the neighbouring suburb of Northam. Church St Mary's Church St Mary's Church serves many Christians in the area including many West African people. On the first Sunday evening of each month there is a Taiz√© style service. The church has peels of bells which ring on monday nights, which inspired the writing of the song The bells of St. Mary's later sung by Bing Crosby. The football club now known as Southampton Football Club were founded at St Mary's Church, on 21 November 1885 by members of the St Mary's Church of England Young Men's Association. The club was originally known as St. Mary's Young Men's Association F.C. (usually abbreviated to \\"St. Mary's Y.M.A.\\") and then became simply St. Mary's F.C. in 1887‚Äì88, before adopting the name Southampton St. Mary's when the club joined the Southern League in 1894. After winning the Southern League title in 1896‚Äì97, the club became a limited company and was renamed Southampton F.C.

The latter formed a unit named Mathematica, which in 1969 \\"was spun off ... to allow for faster growth.\\" Oskar Morgenstern was the first chairman of Mathematica, Inc. Mathematica had three divisions: * Mathematica Products Group - best known for developing RAMIS (software). * MathTech, the company's technical and economic consulting group - \\"research projects and computer systems other than Ramis.\\". * Mathematica (MPR). This unit's strength was in \\"social experiments and surveys.\\" In 1983 MPR reported \\"a major survey assignment for the American Medical Association.\\" A quarter of a century after Mathematica's founding, it \\"was largely owned by a group of professors in Mathematics and Economics at Princeton University ... as this group aged, they opted to cash out by selling.\\" The result was a 3-way split: * Mathematica, now employee-owned, is the only unit still carrying the Mathematica name. * Mathematica Products Group was sold in 1983, eventually becoming part of Computer Associates. * MathTech was described as \\"a Washington-area educational consulting firm shortly after becoming, in 1986, an employee-owned company. Research In 1968, the pre-split Mathematica company conducted the first social policy experiment in the United States, the New Jersey Income Maintenance Experiment (an experimental study of a negative income tax), to test ways of encouraging low-income individuals to work. In 1975, it was incorporated under its present name, as part of Mathematica, Inc. In 1986, the firm became employee-owned, and the only firm using the Mathematica name. MPR became known for its large-scale random assignment evaluations of policies and programs such as abstinence education and Job Corps. =Research centers= In early 1995, Mathematica formed a research affiliate, the Center for Studying Health System Change, which provides objective analyses of how the country‚Äôs changing health care system affects individuals and families. In 2007, the company launched the Center for Studying Disability Policy (CSDP), to inform disability policy formation with rigorous, objective research, and data collected from the people disability policy aims to serve. CSDP provides leadership and support for disability research and data collection conducted by Mathematica. In early 2008, Mathematica created the Center for Improving Research Evidence (CIRE), to identify, assess, and disseminate results from quality, rigorous research to inform evidence-based policymaking. CIRE also provides technical assistance in designing, conducting, assessing, and using a range of scientific policy research and evaluations to support a growing national and international research base. In 2010, Mathematica established the Center on Health Care Effectiveness (CHCE), a resource for policymakers, the public, and other stakeholders, offering expertise and scientific methods to address real-world issues faced by patients, providers, and innovators to improve health care. In 2013, Mathematica established the Center for International Policy Research and Evaluation (CIPRE). Its focus is to provide high quality, objective and rigorous research-based information to funders and policymakers addressing global development issues. Policy focus and capabilities Mathematica has five divisions: data analytics, health, human services, international research, and survey. Mathematica's research fields include disability, early childhood, education, family support, health, international, labor, and nutrition. Within these areas, Mathematica provides services such as program evaluation and policy research, survey design and data collection, research assessment and interpretation, and program performance and data management.

He is credited for changing the face of public transport in India with his leadership in building the Konkan Railway and the Delhi Metro while he served as the managing director of Delhi Metro Rail corporation DMRC between 1995 and 2012. He was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2001, the Padma Vibhushan in 2008, the Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 2005 by the French government and was named one of Asia's Heroes by TIME magazine in 2003. Sreedharan was appointed by the former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to serve on the United Nations's High Level Advisory Group on Sustainable Transport (HLAG-ST) for a period of three years in 2015. He is also a member of Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board. He attributes his exemplary success to the principles learnt from Bhagwad Gita. Early life E. Sreedharan was born on 12 June 1932 in Karukaputhur in the present-day Thrithala constituency, Palakkad district of Kerala state to Neelakandan Moosath and Ammaluamma. His primary education was from Government Lower Primary School Chathannur near Pattambi in Palakkad district. He completed his education at the Basel Evangelical Mission Higher Secondary School and then went to the Victoria College in Palghat. He later-on completed his Civil Engineering degree from the Government Engineering College, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, presently known as JNTUK. E. Sreedharan and T. N. Seshan were classmates at BEM High School and Victoria College in Palakkad. Both of them were selected for Engineering in JNTU Kakinada, a university in a port town in Andhra Pradesh, however, E. Sreedharan decided to pursue it, while T. N. Seshan decided to join Madras Christian College (MCC). =Career as a lecturer= For a short period, Sreedharan worked as a lecturer in Civil engineering at the Government Polytechnic, Kozhikode and a year at the Bombay Port Trust as an apprentice. He subsequently joined the Indian Railway Service of Engineers (IRSE), after clearing the Indian Engineering Services Exam in 1953 conducted by the UPSC. His first assignment was in the Southern Railway as a Probationary Assistant Engineer in December 1954. Government career Pamban Bridge In December 1963, a cyclone washed away parts of Pamban Bridge that connected Rameswaram to mainland Tamil Nadu. The Railways set a target of six months for the bridge to be repaired while Sreedharan's boss, under whose jurisdiction the bridge came, reduced it to three months. Sreedharan was put in-charge of the execution and he restored the bridge in just 46 days. The Railway minister's Award was given to him in recognition of this achievement. =Kolkata Metro= In 1970, as the deputy chief engineer, he was put in charge of the implementation, planning and design of the Calcutta metro, the first ever metro in India. Sreedharan not only completed this much heralded project but also laid down the foundation of modern infrastructure engineering in India. He was taken off this post in 1975. =Cochin Shipyard Limited= When Sreedharan joined the Cochin Shipyard in October 1979, it was undergoing a phase of unproductivity. The production of its first ship MV Rani Padmini had been delayed for a long period. When Sreedharan took over, he turned the fortunes of the shipyard around and made sure its first ship was built while he was its chairman and managing director (CMD). In 1981, under Sreedharan's leadership, the shipyard launched its first ship, the MV Rani Padmini. Finished projects Konkan Railway bridge across the Zuari river in Goa. =Konkan Railway= He was promoted as general manager, Western Railway in July 1987, and in July 1989 elevated to the post of Member Engineering, Railway Board and ex-officio Secretary to the Government of India. On his retirement in June 1990, the Government made it clear it still needed his services and he was appointed the CMD of Konkan Railway on contract in 1990 by the then railway minister, George Fernandes. Under his stewardship, the company executed its mandate in seven years. The project was unique in many respects. It was the first major project in India to be undertaken on a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) basis; the organisation structure was different from that of a typical Indian Railway set-up; the project had 93 tunnels along a length of 82 km and involved tunnelling through soft soil. The total project covered 760 km and had over 150 bridges. That a public sector project could be completed without significant cost and time overruns was considered an achievement by many. Konkan Railway has been covered in the Extreme Railways program by Chris Tarrant as one of the most difficult railway project to have been constructed in the world. =Delhi Metro= He was made the managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation by then Delhi Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma and by mid 1997 all the scheduled sections were completed by their target date or before, and within their respective budgets. Sreedharan was given the sobriquet of Metro Man by the media for his grand success in executing the completion of the Delhi Metro. His stint in the Delhi Metro has been considered so successful and crucial to India that in 2005, he was awarded the Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) by the government of France, and the Padma Vibhushan by the government of India in 2008. There were also demands by prominent political figures that Sreedharan be awarded the Bharat Ratna, the most prestigious civilian award in India. He was particularly known for isolating his projects from political pressures and influences and winning political commitments for fast execution of projects. He had announced that he would retire by the end of 2005, but his tenure was further extended to oversee the completion of the second phase of Delhi Metro. After 16 years of service with the Delhi Metro, Sreedharan retired from service on 31 December 2011. =Kochi Metro= Model of Kochi Metro rail station After his retirement from DMRC, Sreedharan has been appointed as Principal Advisor of the Kochi Metro Rail Project. Initially, the project faced hurdles when a controversy broke out with the government announcing a global tender process for Kochi Metro, rather than letting DMRC handle the consultancy and project execution as Sreedharan and DMRC had initially asked for. Vested interests in the government have been alleged in this decision. However, several political parties came out in opposition of the move, and backed Sreedharan's decision in enforcing DMRC's role in the Kochi Metro, after which the government reversed its stance. Kochi metro was finally unveiled on 17 June 2017 amidst much celebrations. The unveiling of the metro was considered a landmark event in India in terms of completion time, control systems used and initiatives such as employing transgender people, vertical gardening, respecting migrant labourers, and use of solar power. =Lucknow Metro= Lucknow metro logo Sreedharan has also been appointed as Chief Advisor for the Lucknow Metro As per E. Sreedharan, Kochi metro was built in four years whereas Lucknow Metro will be completed in a period of two years and nine months, and that would be the fastest in India and the world till now. =Other Metros= He has been advising for the Jaipur Metro as well as DMRC has undertaken its implementation. He has also been roped in as advisor for a proposed Metro rail system in Andhra Pradesh in the Visakhapatnam and Vijayawada (VGTM) areas, under the leadership of the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu. He has also been advisor for Coimbatore Metro.

The publication was the United States (US)' first skateboarding magazine and, as of August 2013, its Editor/Photo Editor is Jaime Owens, while the magazine's Publisher is Jamey Stone. On August 19, 2013, the magazine's owner GrindMedia announced that the publication would cease production on October 15, 2013. History The magazine was first published in Winter 1964 as a quarterly under the name The Quarterly Skateboarder‚Äîby Surfer Publications out of Dana Point, California, US‚Äîduring the first skateboarding boom. In August 1965 the title was changed to Skateboarder and the magazine began to be published bimonthly. After an initial release of only four issues between 1964 and December 1965, the publication ceased until the first major skateboard revival of the early 1970s. In his first editorial, John Severson wrote: > Today's skateboarders are founders in this sport‚Äîthey're pioneers‚Äîthey are > the first. There is no history in Skateboarding‚Äîits being made now‚Äîby you. > The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will > lead to a bright future for the sport. Already, there are storm clouds on > the horizon with opponents of the sport talking about ban and restriction. However, by Christmas 1965, skateboarding had largely disappeared, and the production of Skateboarder would resume in 1975, with Gregg Weaver featured on the first cover of the bi-monthly publication (it became a monthly publication in late 1977). Warren Bolster (1944‚Äì2006) was the editor of the magazine during its second incarnation and he also enlisted the services of Jim Evans, an artist/designer friend who illustrated the relaunched magazine. Production of the magazine ceased once again in the 1980s, but another relaunch occurred in 1997, with an oversized special issue that is guest edited by Tony Hawk, with art direction by Jaimie Muehlhausen. The success of this special issue led to another issue in the following year‚Äîthe bi-monthly form was reinstated in 1999 and a monthly frequency was eventually established. In April 2013, GrindMedia, the owner of the magazine, decided to replace the subscription- based print magazine with a free digital edition and a bimonthly print replica of the digital issue. On August 19, 2013, a press release from GrindMedia announced the discontinuation of the publication following the release of its third digital edition. Publisher Norb Garrett stated: > Unfortunately market conditions have forced us to have to make the difficult > decision ... our Skateboarder team has worked incredibly hard producing a > cutting-edge product that has been successful at reaching a larger audience > online. We will take all of the learnings from Skateboarder‚Äôs efforts and > apply them to TransWorld Skateboarding and our other brands as the digital > model has demonstrated real promise.

Gudalur is one of the major towns in West Tamil Nadu and is located at 52 km from Ooty in the hilly terrain of The Nilgiris district. It is situated at the junction of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. Tea plantations dot the whole region, and the regional economy is heavily dependent on the tea industry. The land was an offspring to the exploration done by the British during the pre-independence period to cultivate tea plantation. Being a satellite town between Ooty and Mysore, both tourist spots, Gudalur has the prospect of developing into another tourist destination. Gudalur is a place where one can see people from the three states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka live together cordially. Malayalam is the most spoken language in Taluk. Apart from that Tamil ,Chetti, Paneya, Nayaka, Kannada language people are more. Demographics Gudalur Bus Station Junction According to 2011 census, Gudalur had a population of 49,535 with a sex-ratio of 1,032 females for every 1,000 males, much above the national average of 929. A total of 5,359 were under the age of six, constituting 2,719 males and 2,640 females. Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes accounted for 27.66% and 3.65% of the population respectively. The literacy rate of the town was 79.48%, compared to the national average of 72.99%. The town had a total of 12101 households. There were a total of 18,807 workers, comprising 551 cultivators, 1,759 main agricultural labourers, 206 household industries, 14,488 other workers, 1,803 marginal workers, 90 marginal cultivators, 278 marginal agricultural labourers, 119 marginal workers in household industries and 1,316 other marginal workers.

Climate Gudalur is situated at a height of approximately above sea level. The normal rainfall is 3000 mm per annum. While 75% of the rain is received during the southwest monsoon, (June to August) and northeast monsoon (October to November) contribution of northeast monsoon is only 15% to the total of rainfall and 8% of the rains are received during the hot weather and 2% during the winter. The weather is mainly dry during January‚ÄìMarch and the moisture content gradually increases thereon under the influence of southwest monsoon. The wind direction is mainly west and southwest. The town of Devala in Gudalur taluk is known as Cherrapunji of the south, because of the amount of rainfall it receives annually. From 2018 rain fall is increasing.2020 rain fall around 30cm in Gudalur. Transport Gudalur, formerly Gudalore, is linked by road to Ooty by NH 181 and this is one of the Nilgiri Ghat Roads. In the other direction, the same road continues on towards Gundlupet (and on to Mysore) in Karnataka State. Another road links it to Malappuram and Sulthan Bathery in Kerala State. Gudalur is therefore on the access route to other towns in the district for goods and passengers from the state of Karnataka and some from the state of Kerala. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation provides around 70‚Äì80% of transport facilities to and within this town. This Town Has Regular bus services To Major Cities Like Ooty, Coimbatore, Bangalore, Mysore, Salem, Erode, Tiruppur, Malappuram, Calicut, etc. SETC Bus services are available to Chennai, Kanyakumari, and Pudukottai (occasionally). Politics M. Thiravidamani is the Member of Legislative Assembly from Gudalur constituency. Gudalur assembly constituency is one of the three constituencies in the Nilgiris district and the Gudalur assembly constituency a is part of Nilgiris (Lok Sabha constituency). History The total area of Gudalur and the neighboring town of Pandalur is approximately 124,800 acres. In medieval times, before the arrival of the British, the area was divided between three rulers: Vallavanoor, the leader of the Panniyas, Nelliarasi, another adivasi ruler, and the Nilambur Kovilagam, a kingdom based in present-day Kerala. Subsequently, the Kovilagam decided to expand its borders by conquering the other two areas. Vallavanoor was killed and Nelliarasi kidnapped and forced to hand over her lands. Despite some resistance from Vallavanoor's community, the Kovilagam succeeded in subjugating the area and taking approximately 100,000 acres under its control. Gudalur was actually a part of Kerala and Malabar District until 1877. In 1877, it was transferred to Nilgiris district only because of the heavy size of Malabar District and small size of Nilgiris district. Actually Gudalur was the southeastern region in Wayanad during the British rule. Though this Malayalam majority region was transferred to Nilgiris, the court and official language in this region continued to be Malayalam. In modern times, the recognized extent of the Kovilagam's holdings was 80,087 acres under the Malabar Tenancy Act, until 1969. This area is known as 'janmom' land. Kovilagam constructed a temple named Nambalakottai and handed over to Moundadan Chetty community. Chetty community is one of the oldest community in Gudalur where most of their community still have 'Rani Patta' as a proof of oldest community. They have their own tradition and languages. Places of interest Places of interest include Needle Rock View Point, Frog Hill View Point, Mudumalai Wildlife Sanctuary, Mango Orange, Devala Landscapes, Nelliyalam, Moyar, Cherambady mines, Nellakotta fort, Hanging bridges (Thorapally), Genepool Garden, Devala mines, Cherangode Swami Malai, Kusumagiri Murugan Temple, Sandanamalai Temple, Masinagudi and Mudumalai wild life sanctuary The Tropical Gene Pool at Nadugani junction has 2,424 acres area, 47,000 plants, second best of its kind in the world. Museum of butterflies; accommodation, food and trekking facilities. How To Reach * Gudalur is located 50 km from Ooty, the headquarters of the Nilgiris district. * Nearest Railway Station is in Ooty and Nilambur Road Railway station in Nilambur, Kerala * Nearest Airport is Karipur International Airport which is located in Kerala and is 95 km from Gudalur. The nearest airport in the state is Coimbatore International Airport and is 135 km from Gudalur. Mysore Airport ( MYQ ) is a domestic airport in Mysore, Karnataka. It is located about 100 km from Gudalur. * Gudalur also can be reached by bus from the neighboring states of Kerala and Karnataka. * Bus services are available to various parts of South India. Service to Chennai is available every day at 1.30 p.m. Gudalur to Kanyakumari bus service is at 1.00 p.m. everyday via Coimbatore-Tirunelveli. Some of Thrissur to Mysore Buses pass through Gudalur. Ooty to Bengaluru (via Mysuru) buses passes through Gudalur. * Proposal for a new route to join Gudalur with Sathyamangalam is in consideration. This route helps Gudalurites to reach plains like Erode and Coimbatore without travelling in mountainous roads and quicker than the usual route Gudalur - Ooty- Coonoor - Mettupalayam. This new route is an undeveloped path which connects Gudalur -Theppakkad - Siriyur- Thengumarahada-Bhavanisagar - Sathyamangalam on the banks of river Moyar. This route lies in the middle of Mudumalai - Sathyamangalam Forest. Forest department of Tamil Nadu government concerns about wildlife and bio- reserve of this region does not allow any deforestation activities like cutting of trees to lay new roads. * Proposal for construction of railway which connects Nanjangudu (Karnataka) with Nilambur (Kerala) Via Gudalur (Tamil Nadu) Nilambur-Nanjangud line is also in consideration. This new train route would shorten around 450 km in travelling distance to reach Kanyakumari from Bangalore (Bengaluru - Mysuru - Nanjangudu - Gudalur - Nilambur - Shoranur - Trivandrum - Kanyakumari).

Originally of the equestrian class, Maecianus held a series of imperial offices culminating with prefect of Egypt in 161, when Marcus Aurelius adlected him inter praetorios, or with the rank of praetor, into the Roman Senate.Anthony Birley, Marcus Aurelius: A Biography, revised edition (London: Routledge, 1993), p. 179 Maecianus was suffect consul in an undetermined nundinium around AD 166.G√©za Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter der Antoninen (Bonn: Rudolf Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 182 We can follow his career as an eques from an inscription set up in Ostia to honor Maecianus as the patron of that colonia. A second incomplete inscription, , appears to be a copy of the first. This inscription attests that he was prefect of the Cohort I Aelia classica, and prefectus fabrum, two steps in the tres militiae of the equestrian class. The next notable office was a sinecure from the emperor Antoninus Pius himself: prefectus vehiculorum, or director of the public post. According to Anthony Birley this was done so Maecianus \\"could remain in Rome, where he would be available to give advice on legal problems in the council -- one of those experts to whom, Marcus [Aurelius] relates, Pius was so ready to listen.\\"Birley, Marcus Aurelius, p. 62 Other positions he held in Rome include a studiis, a libellis (also known as ab epistulis), and a censibus. At this point Maecianus was promoted to senior equestrian offices. The first was Praefectus annonae, or overseer of the grain supply for the capital city. Next was prefect of Egypt in 161,G.

It was after Marcus Annaeus Syriacus succeeded him in Egypt that Maecianus was admitted into the Senate.

Tien Shan Pai self-defense is characterized by angular attacks coupled with multiple blocks. If one block fails, the second can cover. Footwork is considered essential to countering attacks. Tien Shan Pai focuses on low and steady steps to the side, along with swift \\"hidden\\" steps to trick the opponent. Paired boxing forms and exercises are emphasized for timing and accurate evaluation of distance in reference to a moving, responsive adversary. According to the legend taught by Master Wang to his students the style originated in the Tien Shan mountains of northwestern China.Tien Shan Pai: Founding legend Master Wang maintained that Tien Shan Pai was an ancient style of more than 60 generations.Wang's Letters By contrast, however, some of Wang's still living senior disciples and students state that Tien Shan Pai is an eclectic system, some of which has older antecedents, but which was first taught as a system by their teacher beginning in the late 1940s.The Truth About Tien Shan Pai History Wang Chueh-Jen (ÁéãÁé®Èå± - also known as Wang Jyue-Jen, and before that as Wang San Jer) came from a wealthy familyAbout Wang Jyue Jen - Tien Shan Pai - Lin Kung FuSupreme Master Wang Chueh-Jen from Szechuan Province in China.History of Tien Shan Pai He is credited with bringing the Chinese martial art known as Tien Shan Pai to the public. After training members of Chiang Kai-shek's army in the martial arts, he settled in Taiwan, where he began to teach his curriculum in the late 1940s. Wang's early students competed in tournaments in Taiwan. Most notable among the successes of these early students, was Wu Ming Jer's victory in the International Taiwan-Hong Kong-Macau Tournament (the Tai- Gang-Au) in 1957. In this tournament Wu Ming Jer, won the lightweight division (full contact) championship title.(Taiwan) Central Newspaper, November 26, 1957, p.4. Together with noted Chinese martial arts Master Chen Pan-Lin and others, Wang co-founded the Chung Hua Kuoshu Federation.T'ai Chi Magazine, October 1990, Volume 14, Number 5, page 26. Wang continued to teach Tien Shan Pai, in Taiwan, until his death in 1990. Wang visited the United States four times: three extended stays from 1980-1, 1982-3, and 1985-6, and one brief visit in 1989. During his time in the U.S., he taught at his student's schools, gave interviews on martial arts, and participated in martial arts demonstrations. Some of the curriculum he incorporated into his teaching included forms from the Central Martial Arts Academy in Nanjing. He also taught the internal arts of taijiquan, xingyiquan and baguazhang. Founding Legend Wang Jyue Jen told many of his students a founding legend to instill martial virtue in them. The details of that legend vary in the re-telling, but the story is essentially as follows: At the urging of his mother, a young shepherd, who would come to be known as Hong Yun (Á¥ÖÈõ≤) or Red Cloud, that lived in the foothills of the Tien Shan mountain range followed an old monk into the mountains to learn his martial art. Upon proving his dedication to learning, by kneeling in the snow overnight, the shepherd was taken into the monk's temple. After many years of training he left to pass his skill on to other dedicated students. Modern Practitioners Tien Shan Pai is practiced by many in the United States and around the world. Current Masters in the U.S., all taught by Wang, include (in order of arrival in the U.S.) Willy Lin, Tony Lin, Chien-Liang Huang, and Chao Chi Liu. Willy Lin was the first of Wang Jyue Jen's disciples to arrive in the US. He is credited as being the first person to introduce, and to teach Wang's system of Tien Shan Pai in the United States. In Taiwan (between 1960‚Äì1968,) Lin was Head Instructor and Assistant to Wang, at Wang's ‚ÄúLei Sheng Wu Yuan‚Äù, or ‚ÄúThunder Sound Martial Arts Garden‚Äù school. In 1968, Lin emigrated from Taiwan to S√£o Paulo, Brazil. In 1970, he came to the United States, where, in 1971, he opened his first school in the Washington, DC area. During the next four years, Lin brought his brother, (Tony Lin,) his brother's friend, (Chien-Liang Huang,) and one of Lin's own Taiwanese Tien Shan Pai classmates (Chao Chi Liu) from Taiwan to the US to become instructors at his Lin Kung Fu Schools. Presently, Willy Lin lives in New York City where he still teaches privately. He gives workshops and seminars regularly, around the country, on the traditional forms and practices of Tien Shan Pai (as taught to him by Wang, Jyue Jen.) Lin has produced a series of instructional DVDs in order to record Tien Shan Pai's traditional legacy in both the Kung Fu, as well as the Tai Chi aspects.Lin Kung Fu Lin maintains that he is responsible for the naming of the style as \\"Tien Shan Pai\\" in the US, that this name encompasses all of Wang's curriculum. He further states that Wang, Jyue Jen is the creator (the Founding Generation) of this style, and that this system, now known as Tien Shan Pai, dates from the 1940s. Tony Lin spends his time between Maryland and mainland China. He still teaches privately. Huang Chien-Liang has been teaching and promoting Tien Shan Pai consistently for the past thirty five years. He currently resides in Maryland, and still teaches at his school in Owings Mills, Maryland: The US Kuoshu Academy.The Tien Shan Pai Association Additionally, Huang teaches seminars around the world on Tien Shan Pai and other martial arts styles, and has produced instructional videos on martial arts subjects.Huang's instructional videos Huang is the founder and current President of the Tien Shan Pai Association. The Tien Shan Pai Association ‚Äúsponsors seminars, produces instructional materials, and publishes a newsletter containing articles and information about the Tien Shan Pai style‚Ä¶‚Äù with the intention of making ‚Äúinformation about the Tien Shan Pai style more accessible to the public.‚Äù The Association organizes demonstrations benefiting various charities, and supports and organizes martial arts tournaments. Individual and school memberships are offered in the Tien Shan Pai Association.Tien Shan Pai Association Huang Chien-Liang has displayed images of a sword crafted by Wang and given to Huang by Wang, where an inscription by Wang on the scabbard states that Huang is a 64th Generation disciple.Huang's Disciple Sword Additionally, these inscriptions affirm Wang's position as 63rd Generation Grandmaster.Sword Rubing Although there are classmates who started training under Wang prior to Huang, Huang claims that he is the only full heir to Wang's Tien Shan Pai style. As evidence of his full, formal discipleship, Huang has said that none of his classmates learned as much of the actual Tien Shan Pai curriculum as he did, that only Huang received the initiatory Taoist disciple name from Wang Chueh-Jen, and that Huang has produced written materials from Wang documenting that the lineage was being passed on through him.Huang's School & Disciple Gifts Huang has asserted that Tien Shan Pai is its own style in Chinese martial arts, distinct from other styles included in Wang's curriculum. In support of Huang's assertions, he has made available private correspondence from Master Wang where Wang reiterated that Tien Shan Pai is an ancient style. In these letters, Wang also recognized Huang's tremendous contributions to Tien Shan Pai but expressed regrets about the lack of cooperation and personal attacks perpetuated by Huang's classmates in the U.S. C.C.

The school serves grades 9 through 12 in high school, while the school building also houses Regis Middle School which serves grades 6 through 8. It is part of the Regis Catholic Schools system, which also includes three elementary schools. Bishop John Joseph Paul helped establish the present school. History Regis High School was originally known as St. Patrick's High School. In 1914, Father A.B.C. Dunne added a two- year high school to St. Patrick's grade school. A third year was added in 1919. Monsignor Casper Dowd, Father Dunne's successor, began the construction of St. Patrick's High School and gymnasium in 1927, which housed a four-year high school program. Eventually the four-year school was not large enough to serve the number of prospective students in the four Eau Claire area parishes (St. Patrick's, St. James the Greater, Immaculate Conception, and St. Olaf) and a new building was constructed in the early 1950s. The name St. Patrick's High School was changed to Regis High School during the construction. The new building was in use for the 1953-54 school year. A full-time development director was added in the mid-1970s to raise additional monies and a Regis foundation was established. While enrollment peaked in the 1960s with more than 800 students and gradually declined thereafter, enrollment has consistently increased the last several years. The enrollment of Catholic students from outside Eau Claire has increased, as well as the number of non- Catholic students. During the 1997-98 school year, Bishop Raymond Burke created the Catholic Area Schools of the Eau Claire Deanery (C.A.S.E.) to unite the Catholic schools in the Eau Claire area. The seventh and eighth grade classes from Immaculate Conception and St. Patrick's Schools were moved into Regis High School.Regis Catholic Schools History Retrieved 2011-03-10 Later the sixth grade was added to Regis high school during the 2007-2008 school year, from Immaculate Conception, St. James and St. Olaf. In 2010, the name C.A.S.E. was changed to Regis Catholic Schools, honoring the name of the high school.

The goal of a clinical study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and / or the mechanism of action of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or procedure, or new drug or device that is in development, but potentially not yet approved by a health authority (e.g. Food and Drug Administration). It can also be to investigate a drug, device or procedure that has already been approved but is still in need of further investigation, typically with respect to long-term effects or cost- effectiveness. Some of the considerations here are shared under the more general topic of design of experiments but there can be others, in particular related to patient confidentiality and ethics. Outline of types of designs for clinical studies =Treatment studies= * Randomized controlled trial ** Blind trial ** Non-blind trial * Adaptive clinical trial * Nonrandomized trial (quasi-experiment) ** Interrupted time series design (measures on a sample or a series of samples from the same population are obtained several times before and after a manipulated event or a naturally occurring event) - considered a type of quasi-experiment =Observational studies= 1\\\\. Descriptive *Case report *Case series *Population study 2\\\\. Analytical * Cohort study ** Prospective cohort ** Retrospective cohort ** Time series study * Case-control study ** Nested case-control study * Cross-sectional study ** Community survey (a type of cross-sectional study) * Ecological study Important considerations When choosing a study design, many factors must be taken into account. Different types of studies are subject to different types of bias. For example, recall bias is likely to occur in cross-sectional or case-control studies where subjects are asked to recall exposure to risk factors. Subjects with the relevant condition (e.g. breast cancer) may be more likely to recall the relevant exposures that they had undergone (e.g. hormone replacement therapy) than subjects who don't have the condition. The ecological fallacy may occur when conclusions about individuals are drawn from analyses conducted on grouped data. The nature of this type of analysis tends to overestimate the degree of association between variables. =Seasonal studies= Conducting studies in seasonal indications (such as allergies, Seasonal Affective Disorder, influenza, and others) can complicate a trial as patients must be enrolled quickly. Additionally, seasonal variations and weather patterns can affect a seasonal study. Other terms * The term retrospective study is sometimes used as another term for a case-control study. This use of the term \\"retrospective study\\" is misleading, however, and should be avoided because other research designs besides case-control studies are also retrospective in orientation. * Superiority trials are designed to demonstrate that one treatment is more effective than a given reference treatment. This type of study design is often used to test the effectiveness of a treatment compared to placebo or to the currently best available treatment. * Non-inferiority trials are designed to demonstrate that a treatment is at least not appreciably less effective than a given reference treatment. This type of study design is often employed when comparing a new treatment to an established medical standard of care, in situations where the new treatment is cheaper, safer or more convenient than the reference treatment and would therefore be preferable if not appreciably less effective. * Equivalence trials are designed to demonstrate that two treatments are equally effective. * When using \\"parallel groups\\", each patient receives one treatment; in a \\"crossover study\\", each patient receives several treatments but in different order. * A longitudinal study assesses research subjects over two or more points in time; by contrast, a cross-sectional study assesses research subjects at only one point in time (so case-control, cohort, and randomized studies are not cross-sectional).

Autarky equilibrium (A^A, A^B): no trade, individual production equals consumption. Trade equilibrium: both countries consume the same (C^A = C^B), especially beyond their own Production‚Äìpossibility frontier; production and consumption points are divergent. The Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin theorem is one of the four critical theorems of the Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin model, developed by Swedish economist Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin (his student). In the two- factor case, it states: \\"A capital-abundant country will export the capital- intensive good, while the labor-abundant country will export the labor- intensive good.\\" The critical assumption of the Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin model is that the two countries are identical, except for the difference in resource endowments. This also implies that the aggregate preferences are the same. The relative abundance in capital will cause the capital-abundant country to produce the capital-intensive good cheaper than the labor-abundant country and vice versa. Initially, when the countries are not trading: * the price of the capital-intensive good in the capital-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country, * the price of the labor-intensive good in the labor-abundant country will be bid down relative to the price of the good in the other country. Once trade is allowed, profit- seeking firms will move their products to the markets that have (temporary) higher price. As a result: * the capital-abundant country will export the capital-intensive good, * the labor-abundant country will export the labor- intensive good. The Leontief paradox, presented by Wassily Leontief in 1951,Leontief, Wassily (1954) Domestic Production and Foreign Trade - The American Capital Position Reexamined, Economia Internazionale, (VII): p. 1. found that the U.S. (the most capital-abundant country in the world by any criterion) exported labor-intensive commodities and imported capital-intensive commodities, in apparent contradiction with the Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin theorem. However, if labor is separated into two distinct factors, skilled labor and unskilled labor, the Heckscher‚ÄìOhlin theorem is more accurate. The U.S. tends to export skilled-labor-intensive goods, and tends to import unskilled-labor- intensive goods. Related theorems * Factor price equalization ‚Äì The relative prices for two identical factors of production will eventually be equalized across countries because of international trade. * Stolper‚ÄìSamuelson theorem ‚Äì A rise in the relative price of a good will lead to a rise in the return to that factor which is used most intensively in the production of the good, and conversely, to a fall in the return to the other factor. * Rybczynski theorem ‚Äì When only one of two factors of production is increased there is a relative increase in the production of the good using more of that factor. This leads to a corresponding decline in that good's relative price as well as a decline in the production of the good that uses the other factor more intensively.

He edited the Houston Post from 1885 to 1919, and served a 29-day term in the United States Senate in January 1913 after the resignation of Joseph Weldon Bailey. His term remains the fifth shortest in Senate history. Johnston was a member of the Texas Senate from 1917 to 1920, and also its President pro tempore from 1918.  Early life  Johnston was born in Sandersville, Georgia, on September 9, 1849 (some sources say 1850). He was born the son of Freeman W. Johnston and his wife Mary J. (n√©e Russell). In his early years, Johnston worked in a print shop, but at the age of 12 was enlisted as a drummer in the Confederate States Army, serving a year from 1862 to 1863. After being discharged, he re-enlisted in 1864 and served until the end of the war. After the war, he returned to newspaper work.  Newspaper career  In the early 1870s, Johnston became editor of the Savannah Morning News. He traveled to Texas in 1878, where he took on the editorship of the Crockett Patron. After a year at the Patron, he went on to edit the Corsicana Observer and established the Independent there. In 1880, Johnston moved to Austin, where he wrote for the Austin Statesman. The Houston Post also enlisted him to serve as a correspondent to cover the state capital. After a reorganization in 1885, Johnston was chosen as the new editor-in-chief of the Houston Post, and later became president of the Houston Printing Company. As a noted editorial writer, Johnston was frequently quoted by other newspapers across the United States. He also served as the first Vice President of the Associated Press for two years.  Political career  Johnston, through his newspaper influence, became a leader of the Democratic Party in Texas. He declined the nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 1898. From 1900 to 1912, he served as a member of the Democratic National Committee. At the beginning of January 1913, Oscar Branch Colquitt, Governor of Texas, appointed Johnston to the United States Senate to fill the unexpired term of Joseph W. Bailey. Johnston served a brief term, from January 4, to January 29, 1913. Johnston's 29-day term is the second shortest in Senate history, behind John N. Heiskell's 24 days. Elected to replace Johnston was Morris Sheppard, later known as \\"the father of national Prohibition\\" for introducing the Eighteenth Amendment to the Senate. Following his Senate term, Johnston returned to Houston and resumed his role as editor of the Post. He retired from the newspaper business in 1919. In 1916, Johnston was elected to the Texas Senate, representing Houston. He served in office from January 9, 1917, to January 12, 1920, through the 35th and 36th sessions of the legislature. On March 27, 1918, Johnston was elected as President pro tempore of the Senate. During the 36th legislature, Johnston was chair of the Towns and City Corporations Committee and vice chair of the Public Printing Committee. He resigned his seat in 1920, having been appointed by Governor William P. Hobby as Chairman of the State Prison Commission. In a special election, Lynch Davidson, later a state Lieutenant Governor, won Johnston's former seat. A collection of Johnston's papers is held at Rice University in Houston. His name has also been given to Rienzi, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston's house museum for European decorative arts. The house formerly belonged to Johnston's grandson, Harris Masterson III.  Personal life  Johnston married Mary E. Parsons in 1875, and they had three children. He died on February 28, 1926, and was buried in Glenwood Cemetery, Houston.

The triglycerides in fat are packaged within cytoplasmic lipid droplets. The process begins with acetyl-CoA, which is an organic compound used to transfer energy from metabolism of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ethanol. Through the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is broken down to produce ATP, which is then an energy source for many metabolic processes, including protein synthesis and muscle contraction. Lipogenesis encompasses both fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis, with the latter being the process by which fatty acids are esterified to glycerol before being packaged into very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Fatty acids are produced in the cytoplasm of cells by repeatedly adding two-carbon units to acetyl-CoA. Triglycerides, on the other hand, are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells by bonding three fatty acid molecules to a glycerol molecule. Both processes take place mainly in liver and adipose tissue. After being packaged into VLDL, the resulting lipoprotein is then secreted by the liver directly into the blood for delivery to peripheral tissues. Fatty acid synthesis Fatty acid synthesis starts with acetyl-CoA and builds up by the addition of two-carbon units. Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm of cells while oxidative degradation occurs in the mitochondria. Many of the enzymes for the fatty acid synthesis are organized into a multienzyme complex called fatty acid synthase. The major sites of fatty acid synthesis are adipose tissue and the liver. Triglyceride synthesis Triglycerides are synthesized by esterification of fatty acids to glycerol. Fatty acid esterification takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells by metabolic pathways in which acyl groups in fatty acyl-CoAs are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol-3-phosphate and diacylglycerol.Stryer et al., pp. 733‚Äì739. Three fatty acid chains are bonded to each glycerol molecule. Each of the three -OH groups of the glycerol reacts with the carboxyl end of a fatty acid chain (-COOH). Water is eliminated and the remaining carbon atoms are linked by an -O- bond through dehydration synthesis. Both the adipose tissue and the liver can synthesize triglycerides. Those produced by the liver are secreted from it in the form of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). VLDL particles are secreted directly into blood, where they function to deliver the endogenously derived lipids to peripheral tissues.  Hormonal regulation  Insulin is a peptide hormone that is critical for managing the body's metabolism. Insulin is released by the pancreas when blood sugar levels rise, and it has many effects that broadly promote the absorption and storage of sugars, including lipogenesis. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis primarily by activating two enzymatic pathways. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), converts acetyl-CoA produced by PDH into malonyl-CoA. Malonyl-CoA provides the two-carbon building blocks that are used to create larger fatty acids. Insulin stimulation of lipogenesis also occurs through the promotion of glucose uptake by adipose tissue. The increase in the uptake of glucose can occur through the use of glucose transporters directed to the plasma membrane or through the activation of lipogenic and glycolytic enzymes via covalent modification. The hormone has also been found to have long term effects on lipogenic gene expression. It is hypothesized that this effect occurs through the transcription factor SREBP-1, where the association of insulin and SREBP-1 lead to the gene expression of glucokinase. The interaction of glucose and lipogenic gene expression is assumed to be managed by the increasing concentration of an unknown glucose metabolite through the activity of glucokinase. Another hormone that may affects lipogenesis through the SREBP-1 pathway is leptin. It is involved in the process by limiting fat storage through inhibition of glucose intake and interfering with other adipose metabolic pathways. The inhibition of lipogenesis occurs through the down regulation of fatty acid and triglyceride gene expression. Through the promotion of fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis inhibition, leptin was found to control the release of stored glucose from adipose tissues. Other hormones that prevent the stimulation of lipogenesis in adipose cells are growth hormones (GH). Growth hormones result in loss of fat but stimulates muscle gain. One proposed mechanism for how the hormone works is that growth hormones affects insulin signaling thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity and in turn down regulating fatty acid synthase expression. Another proposed mechanism suggests that growth hormones may phosphorylate with STAT5A and STAT5B, transcription factors that are a part of the Signal Transducer And Activator Of Transcription (STAT) family. There is also evidence suggesting that acylation stimulating protein (ASP) promotes the aggregation of triglycerides in adipose cells. This aggregation of triglycerides occurs through the increase in the synthesis of triglyceride production. =PDH dephosphorylation= Insulin stimulates the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase. The phosphatase removes the phosphate from pyruvate dehydrogenase activating it and allowing for conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. This mechanism leads to the increased rate of catalysis of this enzyme, so increases the levels of acetyl-CoA. Increased levels of acetyl-CoA will increase the flux through not only the fat synthesis pathway but also the citric acid cycle. =Acetyl-CoA carboxylase= Insulin affects ACC in a similar way to PDH. It leads to its dephosphorylation via activation of PP2A phosphatase whose activity results in the activation of the enzyme. Glucagon has an antagonistic effect and increases phosphorylation, deactivation, thereby inhibiting ACC and slowing fat synthesis. Affecting ACC affects the rate of acetyl-CoA conversion to malonyl-CoA. Increased malonyl-CoA level pushes the equilibrium over to increase production of fatty acids through biosynthesis. Long chain fatty acids are negative allosteric regulators of ACC and so when the cell has sufficient long chain fatty acids, they will eventually inhibit ACC activity and stop fatty acid synthesis. AMP and ATP concentrations of the cell act as a measure of the ATP needs of a cell. When ATP is depleted, there is a rise in 5'AMP. This rise activates AMP-activated protein kinase, which phosphorylates ACC and thereby inhibits fat synthesis. This is a useful way to ensure that glucose is not diverted down a storage pathway in times when energy levels are low. ACC is also activated by citrate. When there is abundant acetyl-CoA in the cell cytoplasm for fat synthesis, it proceeds at an appropriate rate.  Transcriptional regulation  SREBPs have been found to play a role with the nutritional or hormonal effects on the lipogenic gene expression. Overexpression of SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c in mouse liver cells results in the build-up of hepatic triglycerides and higher expression levels of lipogenic genes. Lipogenic gene expression in the liver via glucose and insulin is moderated by SREBP-1. The effect of glucose and insulin on the transcriptional factor can occur through various pathways; there is evidence suggesting that insulin promotes SREBP-1 mRNA expression in adipocytes and hepatocytes. It has also been suggested that the hormone increases transcriptional activation by SREBP-1 through MAP-kinase-dependent phosphorylation regardless of changes in the mRNA levels. Along with insulin glucose also have been shown to promote SREBP-1 activity and mRNA expression.

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He played college football for the University of Oregon. He had also players for the Miami Dolphins, San Diego Chargers, Carolina Panthers, and St. Louis Rams. Early career Feeley played high school football at Ontario High School as a quarterback in Ontario, Oregon. In four years, he passed for 5,428 yards and 59 touchdowns.\\"EAGLES GAME DAY FOOTBALL / THREE AND OUT WITH A. J. FEELEY\\", The Press of Atlantic City, 10 December 2006 In addition to football, he played baseball and basketball.\\"FEELEY READY FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY\\", Joe Schad, The Palm Beach Post, 29 February 2004 He opted, however, to play college football for the Oregon Ducks. College career Feeley was a four-year letterman at Oregon, and saw most of his playing time in his sophomore and junior years. He was a nominee for the Davey O'Brien Award\\"Update - In The Running\\", p. 25, 3 November 1999, Eugene Register-Guard as a junior, throwing for 1,951 yards and 14 touchdowns before being sidelined with an elbow injury. However, during most of his senior year, he was a backup to starter Joey Harrington, who was drafted third overall by the Detroit Lions in 2002. Professional career =Philadelphia Eagles= Feeley was selected in the fifth round with the 155th overall pick of the 2001 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles. He spent his rookie year in Philadelphia as the third-string quarterback, backing up Donovan McNabb and Koy Detmer. In the season finale of his rookie season, Feeley came off the bench in the fourth quarter and threw two touchdown passes in a 26-second span to bring Philadelphia back from a 13-3 deficit, and win the game by a score of 17-13. The following season, after McNabb and Detmer went down with injuries, the 8-3 Eagles called on Feeley to preserve the team's Super Bowl aspirations. Feeley surprisingly helped lead the Eagles to four straight wins, and secured the number one seed in the playoffs. With McNabb playing the entire 2003 season injury-free, Feeley was not called upon and did not take a single snap during the season. However, he showed enough in the previous two seasons to garner interest around the league. =Miami Dolphins= Feeley was traded to the Miami Dolphins in March 2004 in exchange for Miami's 2005 second round pick (used by Philadelphia to select wide receiver Reggie Brown). Feeley was set to compete for the Dolphins' starting quarterback job with Jay Fiedler. After the competition, he and Fiedler traded starts throughout the season. The Dolphins season was considered a disaster. Their star running back Ricky Williams retired prior to the season after a failed drug test, and head coach Dave Wannstedt resigned from the team following a 1-9 start. Feeley would under- perform as well; in 11 games, Feeley threw 11 touchdowns against 15 interceptions, for a 61.7 quarterback rating. Feeley would help produce a few bright spots on the year. Following the 1-9 start to enter their bye week, Feeley was given the start in the next six games, going 3-3 (the Dolphins would finish with a 4-12 record) and showing signs of improvement as a starter. Though two of those wins came against the lowly Browns and 49ers, on December 20, 2004, Feeley's 2-11 Dolphins upset the 12-1 Patriots on Monday Night Football, in a game that has become known as \\"The Night That Courage Wore Orange.\\" With the Dolphins trailing by 11 with just 3:59 to play, Feeley guided the team to two late scores, including a game-winning touchdown to Derrius Thompson to upset the defending Super Bowl champions. The game was significant, as the 14-2 Patriots would miss out on homefield advantage throughout the playoffs against the 15-1 Steelers. It was also the last time the Patriots would lose that season, en route to another Super Bowl championship. Due to his strong play to end the season, Feeley was named the starting quarterback going into the season by new coach Nick Saban. However, Gus Frerotte was instead named the starter. =San Diego Chargers= Feeley was traded to the San Diego Chargers midway through the 2005 season in exchange for Cleo Lemon. As the third-string quarterback behind Drew Brees and Philip Rivers, he did not play the entire season. Feeley with the Eagles in 2008 =Philadelphia Eagles (second stint)= Feeley was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles on August 30, 2006, shortly after being released by the Chargers. When McNabb was injured for the season on November 18, 2006, there was speculation that the more youthful Feeley might be named as the new starting quarterback, but head coach Andy Reid went with Jeff Garcia, who led the Eagles to a late-season turnaround and division title. Feeley did play most of the Eagles' regular season finale against the Atlanta Falcons, leading the team to victory with 321 passing yards and three touchdown passes, preventing the Falcons from securing a wild card berth. With Garcia and Feeley both becoming free agents at the end of the season, Feeley signed a three-year contract extension with the Eagles on February 25, 2007. Despite Garcia's success from the previous season, the Eagles viewed Feeley as a better long- term backup because of his age, familiarity of the system, and fit in the locker room. Starting in place of an injured Donovan McNabb on November 25, Feeley threw for 345 yards and three touchdowns with three interceptions in a 31-28 game loss to the then-undefeated New England Patriots. The 10-0 Patriots had beaten opponents by an average of 25 points, and the Eagles entered the game as the largest underdogs in NFL history. On December 2, Feeley played again for the injured McNabb. He threw four interceptions, three of those to Lofa Tatupu in a 28-24 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Feeley was released by the Eagles on September 6, 2009, to make room for Michael Vick. =Carolina Panthers= Feeley drew interest from the Packers and Patriots, but signed with the Carolina Panthers on September 15, 2009. =St. Louis Rams= On March 5, 2010, Feeley agreed to a two-year contract with the St. Louis Rams. Although he was in competition for the starting job, #1 pick Sam Bradford won the starting job in the preseason. During the 2011 regular season, Feeley replaced an injured Bradford for three games and he led the Rams to a stunning upset of the New Orleans Saints on October 30. It was the first win of the season for St. Louis which entered the game with a 0-6 record. Personal life In 2010, Feeley married U.S. women's international soccer player Heather Mitts in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. They currently reside in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On January 30, 2014, the couple gave birth to a baby boy, Connor William Feeley, and a daughter, Blake Harper, followed in spring 2016. Their third child, a son, was born in 2018.

Subsequently, so-called RAS was recognized in APML patients who had been treated with another highly efficacious drug, arsenic trioxide, and yet did not appear in patients treated with tretinoin for other disorders. These facts and others support the notion that RAS depends on the presence of the malignant promyelocytes. This has led to the growing deprecation of the term 'retinoic acid syndrome' and to an increasing use of the term differentiation syndrome to signify this APML treatment complication. Signs and symptoms The syndrome is characterized by dyspnea, fever, weight gain, hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates. This is effectively treated by giving dexamethasone and withholding ATRA (or arsenic trioxide) in severe cases. An elevated white count is sometimes associated with this syndrome, but is not always pathognomonic. Once RAS has resolved, pro-differentiation chemotherapy can be resumed. Causes The cause of RAS is not clear. Several causes have been speculated, including a capillary leak syndrome from cytokine release from the differentiating myeloid cells. Alternatively, ATRA may cause the maturing myeloid cells to acquire the ability to infiltrate organs such as the lung. Mediation by cathepsin G has been suggested. Treatment The treatment of RAS usually involves administering dexamethasone IV, with the dosage usually 10 mg twice a day for 10 days. It is important for patients to discontinue the use of tretinoin due to the elevation of white blood cells and possible low blood oxygen.

At the time it struck, the Great September Gale was the first hurricane to strike New England in 180 years. After striking on Long Island, the hurricane caused major damages in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Rhode Island suffered the worst damage, as the storm surge flooded towns along Narragansett Bay up to and including Providence. Origin The hurricane first struck the Turks Islands near the Bahamas on September 20, with a strength estimated to have been equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane. Impact =New York= The storm struck Long Island on September 23, 1815, probably coming ashore near Center Moriches (Ludlum) around 7:00 A.M. On the south shore of Long Island it broke through the barrier beach and created the inlet that still isolates Long Beach, which had previously been an eastward extension of The Rockaways. =Connecticut= Around 9:00 A.M. the storm came ashore at Saybrook, Connecticut with the force of what would now be considered a Category 3 hurricane. Waves of up to six feet were reported in New London. =Rhode Island= Old Market House, Providence The \\"Great Storm\\" (or \\"Great Gale\\"), as it was known there, hit Providence, Rhode Island on the morning of September 23. From about 10:00 A.M. to noon, the storm delivered a storm surge that funneled up Narragansett Bay where it destroyed some 500 houses and 35 ships. Dozens of ships were deposited on the streets of Providence. The bowsprit of the ship \\"Ganges\\" was smashed into the third story of the Washington Insurance Company building. The Second Baptist Meeting House was destroyed. Most of the buildings on the east side from south of the Market House to India Point were destroyed. At India Point, houses and wharves were destroyed. Both the Washington Bridge and the Central (Red) Bridge were uprooted from their piers and destroyed. The rain appears to have been saturated with salt. The leaves on trees which were not blown away were covered with a white salt coating that resembled a light frost. Even houses turned white. A line on the Old Market Building marks the storm surge that was unsurpassed in the city until the 1938 New England hurricane, which brought a storm surge. There is still a worn plaque on the Rhode Island Hospital Trust building (built in 1917), along with a newer plaque showing the higher 1938 hurricane water level. At Matunuck, Rhode Island, sediment studies have identified the overwash fan of sediments in Succotash Marsh, where the 1815 hurricane storm surge overtopped the barrier beach. The financial loss was estimated at one and a half million dollars, one-quarter the total valuation of the city. Fortunately, only two lives were lost, both in India Point. After the storm, much of the Narragansett Bay area was rebuilt with higher riverbanks, raised wharves, and more durable building practices, to help protect against future storms. =Massachusetts= In Dorchester, Massachusetts, just south of Boston, local historian William Dana Orcutt wrote in the late 19th century of the hurricane's impact: \\"In 1815 there was a great gale which destroyed the arch of the bridge over the Neponset River. This arch was erected over the bridge at the dividing line of the towns [Dorchester and Milton] in 1798.\\" Dorchester's First Parish Meeting House was too badly damaged to repair. =New Hampshire= The eye passed into New Hampshire near Jaffrey and Hillsborough.  Meteorology  In the aftermath of the Great Gale, the concept of a hurricane as a \\"moving vortex\\" was presented by John Farrar, Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard University. In an 1819 paper he concluded that the storm \\"appears to have been a moving vortex and not the rushing forward of a great body of the atmosphere\\".

It is concerned with how video is perceived by a viewer (also called \\"observer\\" or \\"subject\\") and designates their opinion on a particular video sequence and therefore related to the field of Quality of Experience. The measurement of subjective video quality is necessary since objective quality assessment algorithms such as PSNR have been shown to correlate badly with ratings. Subjective ratings may also be used as ground truth to develop new algorithms. Subjective video quality tests are psychophysical experiments in which a number of viewers rate a given set of stimuli. These tests are quite expensive in terms of time (preparation and running) and human resources and must therefore be carefully designed. In subjective video quality tests, typically, SRCs (\\"Sources\\", i.e. original video sequences) are treated with various conditions (HRCs for \\"Hypothetical Reference Circuits\\") to generate PVSs (\\"Processed Video Sequences\\").ITU-T Tutorial: Objective perceptual assessment of video quality: Full reference television, 2004. Measurement The main idea of measuring subjective video quality is similar to the mean opinion score (MOS) evaluation for audio. To evaluate the subjective video quality of a video processing system, the following steps are typically taken: *Choose original, unimpaired video sequences for testing *Choose settings of the system that should be evaluated *Apply settings to the SRC, which results in the test sequences *Choose a test method, describing how sequences are presented to viewers and how their opinion is collected *Invite a panel of viewers *Carry out testing in a specific environment (e.g. a laboratory context) and present each PVS in a certain order to every viewer *Calculate rating results for individual PVSs, SRCs and HRCs, e.g. the MOS Many parameters of the viewing conditions may influence the results, such as room illumination, display type, brightness, contrast, resolution, viewing distance, and the age and educational level of viewers. It is therefore advised to report this information along with the obtained ratings. = Source selection = Typically, a system should be tested with a representative number of different contents and content characteristics. For example, one may select excerpts from contents of different genres, such as action movies, news shows, and cartoons. The length of the source video depends on the purpose of the test, but typically, sequences of no less than 10 seconds are used. The amount of motion and spatial detail should also cover a broad range. This ensures that the test contains sequences which are of different complexity. Sources should be of pristine quality. There should be no visible coding artifacts or other properties that would lower the quality of the original sequence. = Settings = The design of the HRCs depends on the system under study. Typically, multiple independent variables are introduced at this stage, and they are varied with a number of levels. For example, to test the quality of a video codec, independent variables may be the video encoding software, a target bitrate, and the target resolution of the processed sequence. It is advised to select settings that result in ratings which cover the full quality range. In other words, assuming an Absolute Category Rating scale, the test should show sequences that viewers would rate from bad to excellent. = Viewers =  Number of viewers  Viewers are also called \\"observers\\" or \\"subjects\\". A certain minimum number of viewers should be invited to a study, since a larger number of subjects increases the reliability of the experiment outcome, for example by reducing the standard deviation of averaged ratings. Furthermore, there is a risk of having to exclude subjects for unreliable behavior during rating. The minimum number of subjects that are required for a subjective video quality study is not strictly defined. According to ITU-T, any number between 4 and 40 is possible, where 4 is the absolute minimum for statistical reasons, and inviting more than 40 subjects has no added value. In general, at least 15 observers should participate in the experiment. They should not be directly involved in picture quality evaluation as part of their work and should not be experienced assessors. In other documents, it is also claimed that at minimum 10 subjects are needed to obtain meaningful averaged ratings.Winkler, Stefan. \\"On the properties of subjectiveratings in video quality experiments\\". Proc. Quality of Multimedia Experience, 2009. However, most recommendations for the number of subjects have been designed for measuring video quality encountered by a home television or PC user, where the range and diversity of distortions tend to be limited (e.g., to encoding artifacts only). Given the large ranges and diversity of impairments that may occur on videos captured with mobile devices and/or transmitted over wireless networks, generally, a larger number of human subjects may be required. Brunnstr√∂m and Barkowsky have provided calculations for estimating the minimum number of subjects necessary based on existing subjective tests. They claim that in order to ensure statistically significant differences when comparing ratings, a larger number of subjects than usually recommended may be needed.  Viewer selection  Viewers should be non-experts in the sense of not being professionals in the field of video coding or related domains. This requirement is introduced to avoid potential subject bias. Typically, viewers are screened for normal vision or corrected-to-normal vision using Snellen charts. Color blindness is often tested with Ishihara plates. There is an ongoing discussion in the QoE community as to whether a viewer's cultural, social, or economic background has a significant impact on the obtained subjective video quality results. A systematic study involving six laboratories in four countries found no statistically significant impact of subject's language and culture / country of origin on video quality ratings. = Test environment = Subjective quality tests can be done in any environment. However, due to possible influence factors from heterogenous contexts, it is typically advised to perform tests in a neutral environment, such as a dedicated laboratory room. Such a room may be sound-proofed, with walls painted in neutral grey, and using properly calibrated light sources. Several recommendations specify these conditions. Controlled environments have been shown to result in lower variability in the obtained scores.  Crowdsourcing  Crowdsourcing has recently been used for subjective video quality evaluation, and more generally, in the context of Quality of Experience. Here, viewers give ratings using their own computer, at home, rather than taking part in a subjective quality test in laboratory rooms. While this method allows for obtaining more results than in traditional subjective tests at lower costs, the validity and reliability of the gathered responses must be carefully checked. The world's largest crowdsourced picture quality database was made publicly available as the LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database. It contains more than 350,000 human quality judgments from more than 8,000 human subjects. The human judgments were made on more than 1,100 mobile camera photographs afflicted by varying degrees of authentic distortions, instead of synthetically-introduced distortions as has been done in nearly every prior database. = Analysis of results = Opinions of viewers are typically averaged into the mean opinion score (MOS). To this aim, the labels of categorical scales may be translated into numbers. For example, the responses \\"bad\\" to \\"excellent\\" can be mapped to the values 1 to 5, and then averaged. MOS values should always be reported with their statistical confidence intervals so that the general agreement between observers can be evaluated.  Subject screening  Often, additional measures are taken before evaluating the results. Subject screening is a process in which viewers whose ratings are considered invalid or unreliable are rejected from further analysis. Invalid ratings are hard to detect, as subjects may have rated without looking at a video, or cheat during the test. The overall reliability of a subject can be determined by various procedures, some of which are outlined in ITU-R and ITU-T recommendations.ITU-T Rec. P.910 : Subjective video quality assessment methods for multimedia applications, 2008.ITU-R BT.500: Methodology for the subjective assessment of the quality of television pictures, 2012. For example, the correlation between a person's individual scores and the overall MOS, evaluated for all sequences, is a good indicator of their reliability in comparison with the remaining test participants. = Advanced models = While rating stimuli, humans are subject to biases. These may lead to different and inaccurate scoring behavior and consequently result in MOS values that are not representative of the ‚Äútrue quality‚Äù of a stimulus. In the recent years, advanced models have been proposed that aim at formally describing the rating process and subsequently recovering noisiness in subjective ratings. According to Janowski et al., subjects may have an opinion bias that generally shifts their scores, as well as a scoring imprecision that is dependent on the subject and stimulus to be rated. Li et al. have proposed to differentiate between subject inconsistency and content ambiguity. Standardized testing methods There are many ways to select proper sequences, system settings, and test methodologies. A few of them have been standardized. They are thoroughly described in several ITU-R and ITU-T recommendations, among those ITU-R BT.500 and ITU-T P.910. While there is an overlap in certain aspects, the BT.500 recommendation has its roots in broadcasting, whereas P.910 focuses on multimedia content. A standardized testing method usually describes the following aspects: * how long an experiment session lasts * where the experiment takes place * how many times and in which order each PVS should be viewed * whether ratings are taken once per stimulus (e.g. after presentation) or continuously * whether ratings are absolute, i.e. referring to one stimulus only, or relative (comparing two or more stimuli) * which scale ratings are taken on Another recommendation, ITU-T P.913,ITU-T P.913: Methods for the subjective assessment of video quality, audio quality and audiovisual quality of Internet video and distribution quality television in any environment, 2014. gives researchers more freedom to conduct subjective quality tests in environments different from a typical testing laboratory, while still requiring them to report all details necessary to make such tests reproducible. = Examples = Below, some examples of standardized testing procedures are explained.  Single- Stimulus  * ACR (Absolute Category Rating): each sequence is rated individually on the ACR scale. The labels on the scale are \\"bad\\", \\"poor\\", \\"fair\\", \\"good\\", and \\"excellent\\", and they are translated to the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 when calculating the MOS. * ACR-HR (Absolute Category Rating with Hidden Reference): a variation of ACR, in which an original unimpaired source sequence is shown in addition to the impaired sequences, without informing the subjects of its presence (hence, \\"hidden\\"). The ratings are calculated as differential scores between the reference and the impaired versions. The differential score is defined as the score of the PVS minus the score given to the hidden reference, plus the number of points on the scale. For example, if a PVS is rated as ‚Äúpoor\\", and its corresponding hidden reference as ‚Äúgood\\", then the rating is 2-4+5=3. When these ratings are averaged, the result is not a MOS, but a differential MOS (\\"DMOS\\"). * SSCQE (Single Stimulus Continuous Quality Rating): a longer sequence is rated continuously over time using a slider device (a variation of a fader), on which subjects rate the current quality. Samples are taken in regular intervals, resulting in a quality curve over time rather than a single quality rating.  Double-stimulus or multiple stimulus  * DSCQS (Double Stimulus Continuous Quality Scale): the viewer sees an unimpaired reference and the impaired sequence in a random order. They are allowed to re-view the sequences, and then rate the quality for both on a continuous scale labeled with the ACR categories. * DSIS (Double Stimulus Impairment Scale) and DCR (Degradation Category Rating): both refer to the same method. The viewer sees an unimpaired reference video, then the same video impaired, and after that they are asked to vote on the second video using a so-called impairment scale (from \\"impairments are imperceptible\\" to \\"impairments are very annoying\\"). * PC (Pair Comparison): instead of comparing an unimpaired and impaired sequence, different impairment types (HRCs) are compared. All possible combinations of HRCs should be evaluated. = Choice of methodology = Which method to choose largely depends on the purpose of the test and possible constraints in time and other resources. Some methods may have fewer context effects (i.e. where the order of stimuli influences the results), which are unwanted test biases.Pinson, Margaret and Wolf, Stephen. \\"Comparing Subjective Video Quality Testing Methodologies\\". SPIE Video Communications and Image Processing Conference, Lugano, Switzerland, July 2003. In ITU-T P.910, it is noted that methods such as DCR should be used for testing the fidelity of transmission, especially in high quality systems. ACR and ACR-HR are better suited for qualification tests and ‚Äì due to giving absolute results ‚Äì comparison of systems. The PC method has a high discriminatory power, but it requires longer test sessions.  Databases  The results of subjective quality tests, including the used stimuli, are called databases. A number of subjective picture and video quality databases based on such studies have been made publicly available by research institutes. These databases ‚Äì some of which have become de facto standards ‚Äì are used globally by television, cinematic, and video engineers around the world to design and test objective quality models, since the developed models can be trained against the obtained subjective data. Examples of these databases include the popular collection of public-domain subjective picture quality databases available at the Laboratory for Image & Video Engineering (LIVE) website. The LIVE databases were the first high quality, large subjective picture quality databases to be made available to the public free of charge and without withholding of any data portion. Recent work includes the databases by the Institut de Recherche en Communications et Cybern√©tique de Nantes (IRCCyN). A list of European databases related to the field of Quality of Experience can be found in the QUALINET databases.

It later appeared in Anderson's 1981 collection The Dark Between the Stars. The Science Fiction Writers of America selected \\"Call Me Joe\\" for The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume Two. The plot involves an attempt to explore the surface of the planet Jupiter using remote-controlled artificial life-forms. It focuses on the feelings of a disabled man who operates an artificial body.  Plot  Joe is awakened in his den, when a pack of predators are attacking him. Using his great strength, and weapons made from sculpted ice, he kills the animals and, exultant, bays at the moon above him. A vital component shorts out, and \\"Joe\\" reverts to being a human, Ed Anglesey, wearing a special headset on a space station orbiting Jupiter. Anglesey furiously repairs the equipment to restore the connection. It transpires that such equipment failures are happening more and more often. All technical attempts at repair have failed, and instead a psionics expert, Cornelius, is brought to the station to determine if Anglesey himself is the problem. Anglesey uses a wheelchair. He is bad-tempered, dislikes all his colleagues, and is disliked in return. He is allowed to stay on the station only because of his ability to establish a telepathic connection with and thereby control Joe, a creature designed to survive the hostile conditions on the Jovian surface. Cornelius conjectures that something in Anglesey's mind rejects or fears Jupiter, and the resulting feedback keeps destroying the delicate equipment. Eventually Cornelius is allowed to share a session with Anglesey during an important part of the mission. A set of autonomous female Jovians, similar to Joe but lacking a human controller such as Anglesey, has been launched from the satellite and will soon land on Jupiter. Joe, still controlled by Anglesey, is to be the leader, and father, of a new race that will live on the planet. During this session, Cornelius becomes aware of a third mind ‚Äì that of Joe himself. Anglesey's mind has been steadily transforming itself into Joe and shrinking in the process. Cornelius was looking at the problem from the wrong end ‚Äì it was not Anglesey's fear of going to Jupiter and becoming sublimated into Joe's stronger character which was causing the blowouts, but his fear of leaving Jupiter and the freedom Joe's whole and healthy, though non-human, body allows him. Anglesey's existence is poor and constricted compared to Joe's, and the environment has shaped a personality that no longer wants to be human. Seeing himself from Cornelius's perspective, Joe becomes fully self-aware. He ejects Cornelius from the loop and shuts down what is left of Anglesey. Cornelius revives on the station next to the hollow shell of Anglesey's body. Far from being dismayed, Cornelius realizes that this is the way of the future. From now on people with diseased bodies and even the aged can be recruited for the Jovian program if they have the necessary talents. Eventually they will leave their bodies behind and become Jovians in the flesh, functioning as the priesthood of the new race.  In popular culture  A comic book adaptation of Call Me Joe appeared in issue 4 of Starstream, 1976 (script by George Kashdan, art by Adolfo Buylla). The premise of a paraplegic man whose mind remotely controls an alien body also appears in James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar, similar enough for some critics to have called for Anderson to receive credit.

Retrieved 3 December 2007. Ginwala is an Indian South African from the Parsi-Indian community of western India. She studied for a DPhil at Linacre College, Oxford. Ginwala was appointed as the first chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in April 2005. She is one of only four female University Chancellors in South Africa. The University of KwaZulu Natal's first chancellor - Dr Frene Ginwala Biography Ginwala has written a number of books dealing with various aspects of the struggle against injustice. For her efforts, she has been honoured by international and local institutions and governments. Using her anonymity, she played a tremendous role in establishing underground escape routes for ANC leaders and cadres in the period following the Sharpeville massacre and the declaration of the State of Emergency (SOE) in 1960. These included Deputy-President of the ANC Oliver Tambo and Yusuf Dadoo, two leaders of the liberation movement. She also organised safe houses for those who had to remain in the country. Ginwala also chauffeured NIC (Natal Indian Congress) leaders Monty Naicker and J. N. Singh, who were operating from the underground after managing to dodge the police swoop. Their instructions were to travel around the province and raise money from secret donors in order to support the families left destitute through the arrest of their breadwinners under the SOE which hung over the country for five months. Eventually she had to leave South Africa in the latter part of 1960 and together with Tambo, and Dadoo, they established an exile ANC office in Dar es Salaam, Tanganyika which was still under British Colonial Administration until 9 December 1961. The overthrow of the regime in Zanzibar in 1963 paved the way for the formation of the United Republic of Tanzania in 1964. Apart from the ANC, she threw herself in a very broad field of activities. She gave lectures to trainees diplomats at Oxford University, she studied, she wrote for a number of the established media in the UK and elsewhere including the BBC. Frene Ginwala was very instrumental in establishing a communications system in the newly born Republic of Tanzania and Zanzibar. At the request of President Julius Nyerere, she became the managing editor of the English-speaking daily newspaper Standard, and Sunday News. During the entire period of her exile (she returned to South Africa in 1991) she traversed the world preaching the horrors of apartheid and the fight against it. Ginwala holds academic titles from several universities in Africa and abroad. She is a barrister at law; historian; a political scientist, and holds a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University. In the first democratic national elections of 1994 in South Africa, Frene Ginwala was elected to Parliament. She was nominated by the ANC caucus and elected by parliament as the first woman to the position of Speaker of the House. A position she held from 1994 until 2004. After retirement as speaker, she continued serving in a number of international organisations including UN subsidiaries, as Trustee of the Nelson Mandela Foundation and as Chancellor of the University of KwaZulu Natal. President Thabo Mbeki appointed Ginwala on 30 September 2007 to conduct the enquiry into National Director of Public Prosecutions Vusi Pikoli's fitness to hold office.Ginwala appointed to investigate Pikoli IOL She decided generally in favour of Pikoli, but criticised poor communication between departments.
